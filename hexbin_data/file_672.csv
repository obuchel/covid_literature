12772,Statistical issues regarding the article by Liu et al.,2020-09-02,"Motor control in the striatum is an orchestra played by various neuronal populations. Loss of harmony due to dopamine deficiency is considered the primary pathological cause of the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Recent progress in experimental approaches has enabled us to examine the striatal circuitry in a much more comprehensive manner, not only reshaping our understanding of striatal functions in movement regulation but also leading to new opportunities for the development of therapeutic strategies for treating PD. In addition to dopaminergic innervation, giant aspiny cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) within the striatum have long been recognized as a critical node for balancing dopamine signaling and regulating movement. With the roles of ChIs in motor control further uncovered and more specific manipulations available, striatal ChIs and their corresponding receptors are emerging as new promising therapeutic targets for PD. This review summarizes recent progress in functional studies of striatal circuitry and discusses the translational implications of these new findings for the treatment of PD.","Liu, Changliang",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468250/,672

18901,Disaster resilient village-based approach to disaster risk reduction policy in Indonesia: A regulatory analysis,2021-06-23,"The dynamics, nature, strength, and ultimately protective capabilities of an active immune response are determined by the extracellular constitution and concentration of various soluble factors. Generated effector cells secrete such mediators, including antibodies, chemo‐ and cytokines to achieve functionality. These secreted factors organize the individual immune cells into functional tissues, initiate, orchestrate, and regulate the immune response. Therefore, a single‐cell resolved analysis of protein secretion is a valuable tool for studying the heterogeneity and functionality of immune cells. This review aims to provide a comparative overview of various methods to characterize immune reactions by measuring single‐cell protein secretion. Spot‐based and cytometry‐based assays, such as ELISpot and flow cytometry, respectively, are well‐established methods applied in basic research and clinical settings. Emerging novel technologies, such as microfluidic platforms, offer new ways to measure and exploit protein secretion in immune reactions. Further technological advances will allow the deciphering of protein secretion in immunological responses with unprecedented detail, linking secretion to functionality. Here, we summarize the development and recent advances of tools that allow the analysis of protein secretion at the single‐cell level, and discuss and contrast their applications within immunology.","Bucheli, Olivia T.

19213,A project report on the switch from in-class to online tuition in the preparatory course for the knowledge examination for foreign physicians – guidelines for the organization of the online summer semester 2020 at the faculty of medicine of the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität of Münster,2021-06-15,"PURPOSE: High-fidelity simulation calls heavily upon cognitive capacities and generates stress and anxiety. The objective of this prospective, observational study was to evaluate the degree of stress in medical students by measuring hormone levels during critical care classes. METHODS: Overall, 55 students (senior years of medical faculty) of both sexes were divided into 5-person teams. Demographic data and information on diagnosed diseases, stimulants used, and previous experience in the field of medical simulation were collected with a personal questionnaire. Before starting the scenario (T0), after the end of the scenario (T1), and 120 min thereafter (T2), stress level was measured. For this purpose, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean blood pressure, heart rate and blood oxygen saturation were evaluated. In addition, saliva was collected to determine alpha-amylase activity and the concentrations of secretory immunoglobulin class A, cortisol, and testosterone. RESULTS: Among hemodynamic parameters, systolic and mean blood pressure and heart rate were significantly higher in T1 than in T0 and T2 time points (p < 0.05). Cortisol concentration was higher at T2 compared with T0 and T1. Alpha-amylase activity was highest at T1. Secretory immunoglobulin class A concentration was highest at T0, followed by T1 and then T2. These differences were not statistically significant. Testosterone concentration showed significantly higher values at T2 compared with T0 and T1 (p < 0.05). The analysis of team leaders vs. other members revealed significantly lower cortisol and alpha-amylase values in leaders (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: High-fidelity simulation is a useful education method in medical subjects, especially in cases where a mistake could produce serious or irreversible consequences. It can increase stress hormone concentrations and thus can be assumed effective as a learning aid even in senior-year students of medical faculty.","Bialka, Szymon; Copik, Maja; Ubych, Adam; Marciniak, Radosław; Smereka, Jacek; Szarpak, Lukasz; Misiolek, Hanna",Endocrine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8263411/,672

Among MMPs, MMP-2 and MMP-9 are receiving renewed interest as validated druggable targets for halting different tumor progression events. Over the last decades, a diverse range of MMP-2/9 inhibitors has been identified starting from the early hydroxamic acid-based peptidomimetics to the next generation non-hydroxamates. Herein, focused 1,2,4-triazole-1,2,3-triazole molecular hybrids with varying lengths and decorations, mimicking the thematic features of non-hydroxamate inhibitors, were designed and synthesized using efficient protocols and were alkylated with pharmacophoric amines to develop new Mannich bases. After full spectroscopic characterization the newly synthesized triazoles tethering Mannich bases were subjected to safety assessment via MTT assay against normal human fibroblasts, then evaluated for their potential anticancer activities against colon (Caco-2) and breast (MDA-MB 231) cancers. The relatively lengthy bis-Mannich bases 15 and 16 were safer and more potent than 5-fluorouracil with sub-micromolar IC(50) and promising selectivity to the screened cancer cell lines rather than normal cells. Both compounds upregulated p53 (2–5.6-fold) and suppressed cyclin D expression (0.8–0.2-fold) in the studied cancers, and thus, induced apoptosis. 15 was superior to 16 in terms of cytotoxic activities, p53 induction, and cyclin D suppression. Mechanistically, both were efficient MMP-2/9 inhibitors with comparable potencies to the reference prototype hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitor NNGH at their anticancer IC(50) concentrations. 15 (IC(50) = 0.143 µM) was 4-fold more potent than NNGH against MMP-9 with promising selectivity (3.27-fold) over MMP-2, whereas 16 was comparable to NNGH. Concerning MMP-2, 16 (IC(50) = 0.376 µM) was 1.2-fold more active than 15. Docking simulations predicted their possible binding modes and highlighted the possible structural determinants of MMP-2/9 inhibitory activities. Computational prediction of their physicochemical properties, ADMET, and drug-likeness metrics revealed acceptable drug-like criteria.","Albelwi, Fawzia Faleh; Teleb, Mohamed; Abu-Serie, Marwa M.; Moaty, Mohamed Nabil Abd Al; Alsubaie, Mai S.; Zakaria, Mohamed A.; El Kilany, Yeldez; Aouad, Mohamed Reda; Hagar, Mohamed; Rezki, Nadjet",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8508768/,672
26740,Challenges in Economics,2012-02-10,"In 2008, an estimated 33.4 million individuals worldwide were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [1]. Only a few years ago, infection with HIV almost invariably culminated in the development of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), characterized by severe depletion of CD4(+) lymphocytes leading to derangements predominantly affecting cell-mediated immunity, but affecting humoral immunity as well [2]. In the later stages of AIDS, neutropenia and neutrophil functional deficits were common sequelae of HIV infection, other opportunistic infections, or HIV- or opportunistic infection-related treatment [3]. The care of the HIV-infected patient was palliative in nature, and the possibility that use of filgrastim (rHuG-CSF) might extend survival in late-stage AIDS patients with severe neutropenia or severe opportunistic infections, or might be a treatment for HIV infection itself, was explored [4]. Subsequently, however, the development of protease inhibitors and the widespread adoption of their use in multidrug regimens of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) revolutionized the care of HIV-infected patients, and the number of patients dying from HIV decreased dramatically [5].","Hemmige, Vagish; Liles, W.

Seine konkreten Schwerpunktaufgaben haben sich jedoch den jeweils vorherrschenden Problemstellungen angepasst. Gesundheitsförderung, Prävention und Gesundheitsberichterstattung stehen heute in vielen Bundesländern gleichwertig neben Hygiene, Seuchenbekämpfung, amtsärztlichen Gutachten und den jugendärztlichen Aufgaben wie Schuluntersuchung und Zahngesundheit. Viele Aufgaben des ÖGD in der Prävention, Gesundheitsförderung und Gesundheitsberichterstattung konnten — im Gegensatz zu bisher schon bundesweit geregelten Aufgaben wie etwa der AIDS-Prävention — durch die zuständigkeitsbedingte regionale Diversifizierung zwar keine Standards hervorbringen, jedoch vielfach aufzeigen, wo die originären Stärken des ÖGD in diesen Feldern liegen. Speziell die Kompetenz des ÖGD zur Identifikation und Erreichung gesundheitlich und sozial benachteiligter Menschen und Lebenswelten kann die bisherige Mittelschichtsorientierung der Prävention und Gesundheitsförderung verringern helfen, seine Moderationsfunktion zur Bündelung lokaler Ressourcen beitragen. Eine Neuregelung der Gesetzgebung zur Prävention birgt die große Chance, durch qualitative Standards für förderungswürdige präventive Maßnahmen die Stärken des ÖGD zu fördern — sowie einzufordern. Die zukünftig stärkere Nutzung seiner multiprofessionellen Teams und der Verankerung des ÖGD in Kreisen und Städten wird maßgeblich dafür sein, ob es gelingen wird, Gesundheitsförderung und Prävention in Zukunft das notwendige höhere Gewicht zu verleihen.","Szagun, Bertram; Walter, Klaus",Pr&#x000e4;vention,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136943/,672

41027,Sociodrama as a “potential stage” for creating participative and transformative research on social work with families living in vulnerable situations,2020-10-20,"BACKGROUND: Device-associated health care-associated infections (DA-HAIs) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients constitute a major therapeutic issue complicating the regular hospitalisation process and having influence on patients’ condition, length of hospitalisation, mortality and therapy cost. METHODS: The study involved all patients treated > 48 h at ICU of the Medical University Teaching Hospital (Poland) from 1.01.2015 to 31.12.2017. The study showed the surveillance and prevention of DA-HAIs on International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) Surveillance Online System (ISOS) 3 online platform according to methodology of the INICC multidimensional approach (IMA). RESULTS: During study period 252 HAIs were found in 1353 (549F/804M) patients and 14,700 patient-days of hospitalisation. The crude infections rate and incidence density of DA-HAIs was 18.69% and 17.49 ± 2.56 /1000 patient-days. Incidence density of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLA-BSI) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI) per 1000 device-days were 12.63 ± 1.49, 1.83 ± 0.65 and 6.5 ± 1.2, respectively. VAP(137) constituted 54.4% of HAIs, whereas CA-UTI(91) 36%, CLA-BSI(24) 9.6%.The most common pathogens in VAP and CA-UTI was multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii (57 and 31%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) in CLA-BSI (45%). MDR Gram negative bacteria (GNB) 159 were responsible for 63.09% of HAIs. The length of hospitalisation of patients with a single DA-HAI at ICU was 21(14–33) days, while without infections it was 6.0 (3–11) days; p = 0.0001. The mortality rates in the hospital-acquired infection group and no infection group were 26.1% vs 26.9%; p = 0.838; OR 0.9633;95% CI (0.6733–1.3782). Extra cost of therapy caused by one ICU acquired HAI was US$ 11,475/Euro 10,035. Hand hygiene standards compliance rate was 64.7%, while VAP, CLA-BSI bundles compliance ranges were 96.2–76.8 and 29–100, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: DA-HAIs was diagnosed at nearly 1/5 of patients. They were more frequent than in European Centre Disease Control report (except for CLA-BSI), more frequent than the USA CDC report, yet less frequent than in limited-resource countries (except for CA-UTI). They prolonged the hospitalisation period at ICU and generated substantial additional costs of treatment with no influence on mortality. The Acinetobacter baumannii MDR infections were the most problematic therapeutic issue. DA-HAIs preventive methods compliance rate needs improvement.","Duszynska, Wieslawa; Rosenthal, Victor Daniel; Szczesny, Aleksander; Zajaczkowska, Katarzyna; Fulek, Michal; Tomaszewski, Jacek",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7562760/,672

Recent advances in resilience research have shifted away from merely describing individual characteristics towards focusing on the complex interactions between individuals and their dynamic personal, community and cultural contexts. It is clear that resilience involves both neurobiological and cultural processes. Neurobiological contributions include genes, epigenetics, stress-response systems, the immune system and neural circuitry. Culture helps to elucidate collective systems of belief and accepted positive adaptations. Importantly, resilience can also be affected by evidence-based interventions and deliberate practice on the part of the individual. This review seeks to understand resilience as a complex and active process that is shaped by neurobiological profiles, developmental experiences, cultural and temporal contexts, and practical training. It uses the COVID-19 pandemic as a case example to better understand individual and group responses to tragedy.

49340,"Sun, Sand, Sea and Social Work: Issues Facing Social Work Educators in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, West Indies",2020-02-04,"Measurement standards and metrological activities provide a proper scientific and economically sustainable infrastructure to the country [1]. It play a pivotal role as an engine for industrial revolution, growth and support for the overall development of any nation. Metrology is essential to protect the planet, ensuring a dignified quality life for all people to achieve inclusive economic growth and prosperity. It is the main pillar for trade, scientific comparison, innovation of emerging technologies, technical cooperation and even for simple exchange of information. With the advent of better-quality products through metrological advancement, our industries can compete internationally by overcoming all the trade barriers/constraints to achieve the final exports targets. It ultimately translates into growth of industries through rapid industrialization, economic growth and societal upliftment. For industrial and scientific development of any country, the role of NMIs is significant and irreplaceable in the advancement of metrological fields and their related technologies. Dissemination of measurement standards through apex level traceable calibration certificates, training and consultancy services to the industry, government, strategists and academia in different parameters are extremely important. The dissemination of measurement standards in SI units, now related with fundamental constants of nature (FCN), is the prime responsibility of NMI of the country. As India wishes and approaching to become ‘Atma Nirbhar or Self Reliant’, the NMI of India i.e. CSIR-NPL has to play a significant role, not only for providing traceability of measurement standards but also to work in close association with industries, especially with Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises (MSMEs) which contributes almost 38% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It would directly correlate with India’s economic growth and better quality of life for its citizens. The mandate of Physico-Mechanical Metrology (PMM) of CSIR-NPL is to establish, maintain, upgrade and disseminate the standards of mass, volume, density, viscosity; length, dimensions, angle, surface roughness and nanometrology; temperature and humidity; optical radiation (non-ionizing radiation-ultraviolet, visible and infrared region, LED lighting); force, torque and hardness; pressure, vacuum and ultrasonic; acoustic and vibration; and fluid flow. The PMM is the backbone and mainstay for Indian industries and other user organizations. As is evident, these measurements are ubiquitous and cross most strategic sectors and technologies. These parameters play a significant role in the industrial development and their traceable measurements to SI units provide basis for barrier free trade across the continent and the world. The services of these measurements underpin just about every area of human endeavour. The PMM of CSIR-NPL contributes enormously to the economic development of the country by providing traceability to almost all the strategic sectors, MSMEs, Public and Private Sector Undertakings, Government organizations, regulatory bodies, academic institutions as well SAARC nations and other countries through calibrations, testing, need based technical and consultancy services, organization of proficiency testing programmes, industrial trainings and development of academic expertise. The present Chapter of this book is mainly focused on highlighting the significance and importance of PMM, its role and impact in industrial and sectorial growths, applications and relevance with their global compatibility, and finally concludes with some futuristic perspectives.","Yadav, Sanjay; Sharma, Nita Dilawar; Titus, S.

Without downplaying the devastating effects of the virus itself, the collateral damage – specifically in cancer targets – has only compounded an already difficult time in medicine. Therefore, it was of the utmost importance that we: strived to continue to meet our cancer targets, and we analysed our success in addressing this. MATERIALS & METHODS: A key factor was the proximity of a private Nuffield hospital (GN) to the primary trust. GN acted as a ‘clean site’. From 6th April 2020, 2 Xi Da Vinci robots and dedicated staff were relocated to day surgery theatres with direct: access to GN. Endoscopic procedures occurred in GN theatres. Post-operative recovery happened in GN. National guidelines were followed including COVID-19 symptom screening, isolation and preoperative nasopharyngeal swabs. All theatre staff were swabbed weekly and worked solely at GN. Patients were risk stratified prior to admittance. Cancer features and patient risk factors for COVID-19 were taken into account. Standard enhanced recovery principles were applied throughout the patient’s journey. In theatre, we worked to ensure minimal staff numbers for safe practice were present. We reviewed operations performed, alongside cancer (prostate & bladder) pathway data from March to June 2020. For comparison identical data from August to November 2019 was collected. RESULTS: There were a total of 369 cancer operations performed at our Trust from March until June 2020. In comparison, 407 cancer operations were performed in the 4 months from August until November 2019. For both timeframes, a: variety of robotic, endoscopic and open surgeries were carried, with similar numbers seen in each. In total, we received 80 referrals for possible prostate malignancies from March – June 2020, and 150 from August – November 2019. Days to MRI was slightly better in March to June, but we did not find a statistical difference. We: found a statistically significant decrease in the number of days it took for a patient to go from referral to diagnosis. Furthermore, we also improved on the proportion of patients who had their diagnosis told to them within 28 days, from 74% to 87%. In total, we received 134 referrals for possible bladder malignancies from March – June 2020, and 81 from August – November 2019. We improved on days to OPA for patients and time to flexible cystoscopy, with both results carrying statistical significance. We were able to reduce time to OPA from 8 to 6 days, and time to flexible cystoscopy from 26 to 12 days. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that with rapid development of separate ‘clean’ and ‘COVID’ sites, we successfully delivered a comparable, safe and effective cancer service. As we potentially face a second wave we share our success to see if these changes can be replicated elsewhere.","Dirie, J; Hart, E; Mahesan, T; Fawcett, W; Perry, M; Janardanan, S; Moschonas, D; Krishnaji, P; Abou-Chedid, W; Dirie, Jamal",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083501/,672

The impact of IFNL3 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on HPV infection is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between variants in the IFNL3 region and HPV infection in women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. METHODS A total of 236 HIV patients, including 65 HPV-negative and 171 HPV DNA-positive women, were enrolled into this study. The IFNL3 rs12979860 polymorphism was genotyped using a predesigned TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. RESULTS Data showed no significant differences in genotypes or allele frequencies between the HPV DNA-positive and the HPV-negative women (p > 0.05). After dividing the HPV-positive women according to cytology results into patients with abnormal and normal lesions, the genotype and allele distribution of the SNP did not significantly differ between the 2 groups (p > 0.05).

Because of the lack of existing immunity against H7 subtype influenza viruses in the human population and the absence of a licensed commercial vaccine, antiviral drugs are critical tools for the treatment of infection with this novel H7N9. Both M2-ion channel blockers and neuraminidase inhibitors are used as antiviral drugs for influenza infections of humans. The emerging H7N9 viruses are resistant to the M2-ion channel blockers because of a S31N mutation in the M2 protein; additionally, some H7N9 isolates have gained neuraminidase R292K substitution resulting in broad resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors.

Here, we report the occurrence of fatal lower respiratory tract disease associated with human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infection in a 10-year-old girl with chronic graft-versus-host disease following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for secondary chronic myeloid leukemia. Symptoms occurred 8 months after HSCT while on immunosuppression with 0.2 mg/kg/day of prednisone, and presented as dry cough, bilateral pneumonitis, and progressive respiratory distress. Non-invasive and invasive microbiological investigations revealed HMPV type B as the sole pathogen. Histopathological findings showed interstitial and intra-alveolar pneumonitis with profound alveolar cell damage. The patient was treated with intravenous and oral ribavirin and polyvalent immunoglobulins, but ultimately died from respiratory failure. The case reflects the potentially fatal impact of infections by respiratory viruses in immunocompromised patients and the need for effective approaches to their prevention and treatment.","Dokos, C; Masjosthusmann, K; Rellensmann, G; Werner, C; Schuler-Lüttmann, S; Müller, K-M; Schiborr, M; Ehlert, K; Groll, A H",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.12074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23551689/,672

Moreover, the application of metabolomics in nutrition could provide significant information on the best nutrition regimen, optimal infantile growth and even in the characterization and improvement of commercial products' composition.These are only some of the fields in which metabolomics was applied, in the perspective of a precision-based, personalized care of human health.In this review, we discuss the available literature on such topic and provide some evidence regarding clinical application of metabolomics in heart diseases, auditory disturbance, nephrouropathies, adult and pediatric cancer, obstetrics, perinatal conditions like asphyxia, neonatal nutrition, neonatal sepsis and even some neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism.Our research group has been interested in metabolomics since several years, performing a wide spectrum of experimental and clinical studies, including the first metabolomics analysis of human breast milk. In the future, it is reasonable to predict that the current knowledge could be applied in daily clinical practice, and that sensible metabolomics biomarkers could be easily detected through cheap and accurate sticks, evaluating biofluids at the patient's bed, improving diagnosis, management and prognosis of sick patients and allowing a personalized medicine.

A bibliographic search was carried out on March 11, 2021, among published studies in the years 2019-2021 in the PubMed database and based on the search strategy (""COVID-19"" AND ""oral lesions"" OR ""oral mucositis"" OR ""oral manifestation""). After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 29 articles were considered suitable for this review. A total of 110 cases of patients with COVID-19 who had oral manifestations were reported. The presence of ulcerated lesions was the most common finding, having a herpetiform and aphthous clinical pattern observed in most cases. Macules, petechiae, hemorrhagic blisters, pustular enanthem, mucositis, and halitosis were also among the most frequently described oral manifestations. The tongue was the most commonly affected site, followed by the palate and lip. Most of the reported cases were diagnosed only by the clinical aspect of the lesion associated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test or the presence of other COVID-19 symptoms. Current scientific evidence still could not affirm that most of the oral lesions observed in patients with COVID-19 are related to the virus's direct or indirect action on the oral mucosa. To confirm this association, prospective and longitudinal studies are further needed, together with a larger number of patients, complemented by histopathological examination of these lesions. Additionally, molecular techniques, such as immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, may be necessary to perform the differential diagnosis with other oral lesions.","Reis, Vanessa Paiva; Bezerra, Adriana Raymundo; Maia, Adriane Batista Pires; Marques, Letícia Côgo; Conde, Danielle Castex",International journal of dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijd.15881; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34541674/,672

To better understand cognitive complaints in aging, we systematically reviewed the evidence to determine their prevalence and characterization among older adults with the most common age-related chronic conditions. METHODS This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement and the review protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42020153147). Searches were conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I in June 2020. Two members of the review team independently determined article eligibility for inclusion and conducted quality appraisal. A narrative synthesis of results was used to integrate findings across studies and draw conclusions regarding the strength of the evidence in each chronic condition category. RESULTS Thirty-seven articles met eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Conditions represented were diabetes (n = 20), heart disease (n = 13), hypertension (n = 10), chronic lung disease (n = 5), arthritis (n = 4), heart failure (n = 2), and hyperlipidemia (n = 2). In addition, 16 studies included a measure of multimorbidity. Overall, there was a higher prevalence of cognitive complaints in individuals with higher multimorbidity, including a potential dose-dependent relationship. Findings for specific conditions were inconsistent, but there is evidence to suggest that cross-sectionally, older adults with diabetes, heart disease, chronic lung disease, and arthritis have more cognitive complaints than those without these conditions. CONCLUSION There is strong evidence demonstrating that cognitive complaints are more common in older adults with higher multimorbidity, but little research examining these associations over time. Improving our understanding of the longitudinal trajectory of cognitive complaints, multimorbidity, and objective cognition in older age is an important area for future research.","Hill, Nikki L; Bhargava, Sakshi; Brown, Monique J; Kim, Hyejin; Bhang, Iris; Mullin, Kaitlyn; Phillips, Kathleen; Mogle, Jacqueline",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34234373/,672

82226,Three versus five intravitreal aflibercept injections as the initial loading phase in the treatment of diabetic macular edema: one-year results.,2020,"Transposable elements (TEs) have had a major influence on shaping both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, largely through stochastic events following random or near-random insertions. In the mammalian immune system, the recombination activation genes1/2 (Rag1/2) recombinase has evolved from a transposase gene, demonstrating that TEs can be domesticated by the host. In this study, we uncovered a domesticated transposase, Kluyveromyces lactis hobo/Activator/Tam3 (hAT) transposase 1 (Kat1), operating at the fossil imprints of an ancient transposon, that catalyzes the differentiation of cell type. Kat1 induces mating-type switching from mating type a (MATa) to MATα in the yeast K. lactis. Kat1 activates switching by introducing two hairpin-capped DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the MATa1-MATa2 intergenic region, as we demonstrate both in vivo and in vitro. The DSBs stimulate homologous recombination with the cryptic hidden MAT left alpha (HMLα) locus resulting in a switch of the cell type. The sites where Kat1 acts in the MATa locus most likely are ancient remnants of terminal inverted repeats from a long-lost TE. The KAT1 gene is annotated as a pseudogene because it contains two overlapping ORFs. We demonstrate that translation of full-length Kat1 requires a programmed -1 frameshift. The frameshift limited Kat1 activity, because restoring the zero frame causes switching to the MATα genotype. Kat1 also was transcriptionally activated by nutrient limitation via the transcription factor mating type switch 1 (Mts1). A phylogenetic analysis indicated that KAT1 was domesticated specifically in the Kluyveromyces clade of the budding yeasts. We conclude that Kat1 is a highly regulated transposase-derived endonuclease vital for sexual differentiation.","Rajaei, Naghmeh; Chiruvella, Kishore K; Lin, Feng; Aström, Stefan U",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1406027111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25313032/,672
82660,[Ultrasonografía pulmonar en COVID-19: serie de casos].,2020-12-10,"Background Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is a common pathogenic bacterium which causes pleural empyema, and infection of P. aeruginosa is often associated with biofilm. The aim of this study was to establish a model of rabbit empyema infected by P. aeruginosa to determine whether it causes the formation of biofilm in the pleural cavity. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) on biofilm formation in this P. aeruginosa empyema model. Methods Twenty rabbits were used and randomly divided into five groups: PAO1, PAO1ΔwspF, and PAO1/p lac-yhjH infection groups, and Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and turpentine control groups. A drainage catheter was implanted into the pleural cavity through thoracentesis. The three infection groups were respectively infected with PAO1, PAO1ΔwspF, and PAO1/p lac-yhjH strains, which caused empyema. The two control groups were injected with LB or turpentine. After 4 days of infection, we sacrificed the rabbits. We evaluated the pathology of pleura through hematoxylin-eosin staining. Colony count and crystal violet assay were used to analyze the biofilm formation on the surface of catheters. Scanning electron was used to observe the biofilm on the surface of the pleura. Peptide nucleic acids-fluorescence in situ hybridization (PNA-FISH) was used to observe the biofilm in the fibrinous deposition. Results By the PNA-FISH assay, biofilms were observed in the fibrinous deposition of the three infection groups. The red fluorescence area of the PAO1ΔwspF infection group was larger than that of the PAO1 and PAO1/p lac -yhjH infection groups. Through electron microscopy, we observed that PAO1 strains were embedded in an electron-dense extracellular matrix on the surface of pleural tissue, and appeared to be biofilm-like structures. For the crystal violet assay, the optical density values of different groups were significantly different: PAO1ΔwspF > PAO1 > PAO1/p lac-yhjH > control groups (P<0.05). Conclusions To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first study to report P. aeruginosa forming biofilm in a novel animal model of pleural empyema. In addition, c-di-GMP signaling molecules played an important role in biofilm formation in the pleural cavity.","Zhang, Li; Li, Jinlong; Liang, Jinhua; Zhang, Zhenqiang; Wei, Qingjun; Wang, Ke",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-6022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33240995/,672

90835,The potential impact of COVID-19 on the Canadian Resident Matching Service: Unique future challenges faced by urology residency programs and applicants.,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND Pancreatic duct ligation in a minipig model leads to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). This allows the study of digestive processes and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies. However, detailed descriptions of the surgical procedure, perioperative management, a determination of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency are scarce in the literature. Data of the long-term health status of minipigs upon EPI induction are still not available. Therefore, the present study describes in detail an experimental approach to the induction of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency via pancreatic duct ligation in minipigs and the long term follow up of the animal's health state. METHODS 14 Goettingen minipigs underwent pancreatic duct ligation via midline laparotomy for the induction of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Fecal fat content, fat absorption, chymotrypsin levels, body weight and blood vitamin and glucose levels were determined. RESULTS Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was successfully induced in 12 Goettingen minipigs. Two minipigs failed to develop exocrine insufficiency most likely due to undetected accessory pancreatic ducts. All animals tolerated the procedure very well and gained weight within 8 weeks after surgery without requiring pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. The follow up for approx. 180 weeks showed a stable body weight and health state of the animals with normal blood glucose levels (Table 1). From approx. 130 weeks post pancreatic duct ligation, all animals were supplemented with pancreatic enzymes and vitamins resulting in blood concentrations almost within the reference range. CONCLUSIONS Pancreatic duct ligation in minipigs is an excellent method of inducing exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. It is important to identify and ligate accessory pancreatic ducts since persistence of accessory ducts will lead to maintenance of exocrine pancreatic function. The EPI model caused no persistent side effects in the animals and has the potential to be used in long-term EPI studies with up to 100 weeks post-OP without supplementation with enzymes and vitamins.","Luu, Andreas Minh; Brock, Alexander; Ritz, Sabrina; Junghänel, Sandra; Aldag, Ingo; Edskes, Stella; Hartmann, Marcus; Hessler, Michael; Praktiknjo, Michael; Arnemann, Philip; Ertmer, Christian; Uhl, Waldemar; Schnekenburger, Juergen; Herzog, Torsten",BMC gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12876-020-01541-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33256637/,672

METHODS Men presenting to an andrology clinic between July 2014 and June 2017 completed questionnaires assessing shift work schedule, SWSD risk, and hypogonadal symptoms ((quantitative) Androgen Deficiency in the Aging Male (qADAM, ADAM). The impact of non-standard shift work and SWSD on responses to qADAM and ADAM was assessed using ANOVA and linear regression. RESULTS 24.1% (619/2571) of men worked non-standard shifts. Of those, 196 (31.7%) were considered to have SWSD. Controlling for age, comorbidities and testosterone (T) levels, non-standard shift workers had qADAM scores 1.12 points lower than daytime workers (p<0.01). Sub-group analysis of non-standard shift workers showed that those with SWSD had qADAM scores 5.47 points lower than men without SWSD (p<0.01). In this same sub-group analysis, SWSD was independently associated with lower T levels (mean decrease 100.4 ng/dL, p<0.01) when controlling for age, comorbidities and prior T supplementation. CONCLUSIONS Non-standard shift workers with SWSD have even worse hypogonadal symptoms and lower T levels than daytime workers and non-standard shift workers without SWSD. This suggests that poor sleep habits, as identified by SWSD, may contribute to the more severe hypogonadal symptoms seen in non-standard shift workers.","Balasubramanian, Adithya; Kohn, Taylor P; Santiago, Javier E; Sigalos, John T; Kirby, E Will; Hockenberry, Mark S; Pickett, Stephen M; Pastuszak, Alexander W; Lipshultz, Larry I",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2019.10.040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31917971/,672

METHODOLOGY Two irrigation protocols - Protocol A using 2% NaOCl used 5mL/5 min and Protocol B with 2% NaOCl (5mL/5 min) followed by 17% EDTA (5mL/3 min) were used to prepare dentine. The chemical and microstructural changes following irrigation were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (n=5) on dentine obtained from the mid-root and coronal parts of extracted human teeth. Four sealers (AH Plus, BioRoot, MTA Fillapex, TotalFill) were characterized by SEM/EDS (n=3). The ability of the sealers to eradicate intratubular Enterococcus faecalis biofilms was assessed by live/dead dye and confocal laser scanning microscopy to measure the percentage of living cells. The effect of combined irrigation and root filling on the dentine was assessed by SEM and EDS analysis (n=5). Statistical analysis was undertaken using one-way ANOVA and a number of post hoc tests to detect intergroup differences. The F test was used for comparison of variances in the microbiology testing. RESULTS The use of NaOCl alone left the smear layer seemingly intact, with traces of chlorine remaining on dentine. The use of BioRoot sealer restored the calcium ion levels of dentine which are depleted by the irrigation with EDTA. BioRoot exhibited antimicrobial properties against intratubular bacteria even in the presence of smear layer (Protocol A). The smear layer removal improved the bactericidal effect of all sealers and Ca2+ leaching. The use of a chelating agent was important for the intratubular sealer penetration for AH Plus but not the other sealers. CONCLUSION The removal of smear layer was associated with greater penetration of AH Plus into the dentinal tubules but not for the penetration of HCSC sealers. BioRoot was a more effective sealer in reducing the bacterial load in the dentinal tubules than the other materials tested and the presence of smear layer did not affect its activity.","Zancan, R F; Di Maio, A; Tomson, P L; Duarte, Mah; Camilleri, J",International endodontic journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/iej.13522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763882/,672

Slow vital capacity (SVC) was canceled in some countries to prevent COVID-19 transmission. We aimed to test phrenic nerve motor responses as an option to SVC in clinical trials. Methodology: Patients followed-up in our unit were selected respecting inclusion criteria used elsewhere: possible/probable/definite disease; onset-age 18-80years; disease duration from disease duration ≤24months; body mass index (BMI)>20kg/m2; respiratory subscore of the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R)≥11; upright SVC ≥ 70%. We added normal phrenic responses (meanPhrenAmpl, ≥0.4mV). All patients were on riluzole. SVC and meanPhrenAmpl were recorded at study entry (T0) and 24 weeks later (T1). Decays were determined. Sample size was calculated for a treatment effect of 30% on the decay rate. Results: We included 317 ALS patients (191 males, 225 spinal-onset), mean onset-age 59.9 ± 10.7 (31-80)years, mean onset BMI 25.48 ± 3.2 (20.1-35)kg/m2, mean disease duration 10.5 ± 5.6 (1-24)months, mean ALSFRS-R 41.54 ± 4.3 (22-47) and respiratory subscore 11.83 ± 0.38 (11-12). MeanPhrenAmpl and SVC were weakly but significantly correlated at T0 and T1. At T1, MeanPhrenAmpl decayed 16.94 ± 16.45% and SVC 13.5 ± 16.86%. For the proposed drug effect, 174 and 272 patients would be needed to recruit using respectively meanPhrenAmpl and SVC decline as the primary outcome measurement (accepting no dropouts). Discussion: Contrary to SVC, meanPhrenAmpl is non-volitional and not associated with aerosolization risk. Lower recruitment number (98 patients less) would be needed, translating shorter inclusion period, trial length and costs, and probable lower missed data rate. MeanPhrenAmp is an alternative test in ALS clinical trials.","Pinto, Susana; De Carvalho, Mamede",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,https://doi.org/10.1080/21678421.2021.1895842; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33683161/,672

METHODS Demographic and operative details were collected prospectively and outcomes recorded for all patients undergoing laparoscopic or open AAA repair. RESULTS A total of 316 patients underwent laparoscopic (51), open (53) or endovascular (EVAR; 212) AAA repair between 2007 and 2013. The median age of patients who had laparoscopic or open repair was 72 (i.q.r. 66-75) years, and 92·3 per cent were men. There was no significant difference in sex distribution, age or V-POSSUM physiology score between laparoscopic and open repair. Of the 51 laparoscopic procedures, six were totally laparoscopic, 43 were laparoscopically assisted and two were converted to open repair. Pain scores were similar on days 1 and 3 after laparoscopic and open repair, even though epidurals were used in the open group, and were lower on days 5 and 7 after laparoscopic procedures. Patients who had laparoscopic repair had significantly fewer postoperative cardiorespiratory and renal complications (P = 0·017), and were discharged from hospital sooner (median 5 (i.q.r. 3-7) versus 8 (6-11) days; P = 0 ·001). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic AAA repair was performed safely, and with at least equivalent outcomes to open repair, in patients unfavourable for EVAR.","Howard, A Q; Bennett, P C; Ahmad, I; Choksy, S A; Mackenzie, S I P; Backhouse, C M",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.9714; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25689292/,672

METHODS We pursued a comprehensive molecular survey of bacteria and viruses in nasal wash specimens from children with acute respiratory disease collected prospectively over 1 year (January 1 through December 31, 2009) from 915 Navajo and White Mountain Apache children in their second or third year of life who had been enrolled in an efficacy study of a respiratory syncytial virus monoclonal antibody in the first year of life. RESULTS During the surveillance period, 1476 episodes of disease were detected in 669 children. Rates of outpatient and inpatient lower respiratory tract illness were 391 and 79 per 1000 child-years, respectively, and were most commonly diagnosed as pneumonia. Potential pathogens were detected in 88% of specimens. Viruses most commonly detected were respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus; the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) illnesses primarily occurred in the fall. Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected in 60% of subjects; only human rhinovirus was significantly associated with S. pneumoniae carriage. The presence of influenza virus, human rhinovirus or S. pneumoniae was not associated with increased risk for lower respiratory tract involvement or hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS Acute lower respiratory illnesses occur at disproportionately high rates among young American Indian children and are associated with a range of common pathogens. This study provides critical evidence to support reducing the disproportionate burden of acute respiratory disease among young Native Americans.","Bhat, Niranjan; Tokarz, Rafal; Jain, Komal; Haq, Saddef; Weatherholtz, Robert; Chandran, Aruna; Karron, Ruth; Reid, Raymond; Santosham, Mathuram; O'Brien, Katherine L; Lipkin, W Ian",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e31828ff4bc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23470677/,672

110199,Serum and synovial fluid analysis for diagnosing chronic periprosthetic infection in patients with inflammatory arthritis.,2012,"Canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) is a major cause of morbidity in dogs and is associated with several viral pathogens. The viral diversity associated with CIRD was investigated by analyzing the viral communities from nine CIRD-affected dogs using metagenomics. The results identified ten mammalian viruses, including canine parvovirus, canid alphaherpesvirus 1, canine kobuvirus, Felis catus papillomavirus 3, canine respiratory coronavirus, canine adenovirus 2, Canis familiaris polyomavirus (DogPyV), canine coronavirus, human papillomavirus, and canine pneumovirus (CPnV). Interestingly, CPnV and DogPyV were first discovered in China. Further investigation in 107 samples in China using specific PCR found only two CPnV positive strains in 51 CIRD samples and none in 56 healthy samples. Furthermore, a complete nucleotide sequence of CPnV strain SMU-2020-CB19 and a partial nucleotide sequence of strain SMU-2020-CB14 were obtained. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis showed that both novel CPnV strains were a close match to the detected swine orthopneumovirus strain in USA, but distantly related to other CPnV strains. Here, the first discovery and characterization of orthopneumovirus in dogs with CIRD in China were reported, highlighting the need for further research on pathogenicity and transmission in China.

111583,Coronavirus and the eye: what is relevant so far?,2020-06-01,"The global pandemic due to the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has taken more than a million lives. Lack of definitive vaccine/drugs against this highly contagious virus has accelerated exploratory research on novel natural and synthetic inhibitors. Tea is a rich source of bioactives and known to have antiviral properties. In this study, an in silico strategy involving ADMET property screening, receptor-ligand docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was employed to screen potential tea bio-active inhibitors against three selected targets (RdRp, 3CLpro and PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Among the 70 tea bioactives screened, theaflavin 3,3'-di-gallate (TF3), Procyanidin B2 and Theaflavin 3-gallate (TF2a) exhibited highest binding affinities towards RdRp, 3CLpro/Mpro and PLpro targets of SARS-CoV-2 with low docking scores of -14.92, -11.68 and -10.90 kcal/mol, respectively. All of them showed a substantial number of hydrogen bonds along with other interactions in and around the active sites. Interestingly, the top bioactives in our study showed higher binding affinities compared with known antiviral drugs. Further, the top protein-ligand complexes showed less conformational changes during binding when subjected to MD simulation for 100 nanoseconds. The MMPBSA results revealed that RdRp-TF3, 3CLpro-Procyanidin B2 and PLpro-TF2a complexes were stable with binding free energies of -93.59 ± 43.97, -139.78 ± 16.51 and -96.88 ± 25.39 kJ/mol, respectively. Our results suggest that theaflavin 3,3'-digallate, Theaflavin 3-gallate and Procyanidin B2 found in black tea have the potential to act as inhibitors for selected targets of SARS-CoV-2 and can be considered as drug candidates in future studies against COVID-19.

111844,Prioritizing systemic therapies for genitourinary malignancies: Canadian recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-04-05,"The high thermoelectric performance of cuprous selenide (Cu2Se) arises from its specific structures consisting of two independent sublattices, i.e. the rigid face-centered cubic (f.c.c.) Se sublattice and the flexible Cu sublattice showing a variety of ordered configurations at numerous interstitial sites. Upon increasing the temperature, the Cu sublattice undergoes an order-to-disorder transition but the details of the structural evolution have not been fully elucidated. Here, in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is used to investigate the thermally induced structural changes of Cu2Se in both real and reciprocal spaces. Order-disorder transition was found to proceed in nanoblocks accompanied by the structural fluctuations between low-temperature and high-temperature phases. Electron diffraction revealed the emergence of medium-range ordering of Cu atoms in the high-temperature f.c.c. phase. By referring to the Coulomb interaction evaluations, the superstructures for the medium-range ordering were constructed. Such medium-range atomic ordering was sustained over a wide temperature range (from the phase transition temperature to over 800 K in the TEM) but gradually changed to short-range ordering as indicated by the appearance of diffuse scattering rings.","Lu, Ping; Qiu, Wujie; Wei, Yuyu; Zhu, Chenxi; Shi, Xun; Chen, Lidong; Xu, Fangfang","Acta crystallographica Section B, Structural science, crystal engineering and materials",https://doi.org/10.1107/s2052520620002164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831222/,672
114404,The new coronavirus that came from the East: analysis of the initial epidemic in Mexico.,2020,"Background: Ireland's health system has been under significant strain due to staff shortages and inadequate capacity. Critical care bed capacity per capita in Ireland is among the lowest in Europe, thus, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put additional strain on an over-stretched system. COVID-19 Community Assessment Hubs (CAHs) were established to mitigate unnecessary admission to acute hospitals, and reduce infection spread by supporting COVID-19 positive or suspected positive patients to isolate at home, or in isolation facilities. There is some evidence that similar assessment centres may be a successful triage strategy to reduce burden on hospital and acute care. Aim : The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 Community Assessment Hubs on service delivery in one region in Ireland. Methods: A mixed-methods approach will be used, incorporating co-design to engage stakeholders and ensure informed data capture and analysis. Online surveys will assess CAH patients' experiences of access to and quality of care. Clinical patient data from CAHs will be collected and analysed using multinomial logistic regression to check for association with patient demographics and COVID-19 symptoms, and CAH early warning scores and outcomes (Transfer to Emergency Department, Transfer to isolation unit, Sent home with care plan). Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with: patients to elicit an in-depth understanding of experiences and acceptability of attending CAHs; and staff to understand challenges, benefits, and effectiveness of CAHs. Interview data will be analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Discussion: This study will provide valuable insights from both patient and staff perspectives on the operation of CAHs. We will evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of CAHs and propose areas for improvement of the service. This will contribute to international literature on the use of community assessment centres during infectious disease pandemics.","Mulcahy Symmons, Sophie; Fox, Robert; Mannion, Marese; Joyce, David; De Brún, Aoife; Glynn, Liam; Ryan, Damien; Keane, Niamh; McAuliffe, Eilish",HRB open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13217.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34056538/,672

Here, we introduce a new strategy for transferring modular reconfigurable DNA nanostructures from 2D to 3D. A 2D DNA sheet could be modularized into connected parts (e.g. two, three and four parts in this work), which can be independently transformed between two conformations with a few DNA ""trigger"" strands. More interestingly, the transformation of the connected 2D modules can lead to the controlled, resettable structural conversion of a 2D sheet to a 3D architecture, due to the constraints induced by the connections between the 2D modules. This new approach can provide an efficient mean for constructing programmable, higher-order, and complex DNA objects, as well as sophisticated dynamic substrates for various applications.","Liu, Yan; Cheng, Jin; Fan, Sisi; Ge, Huan; Luo, Tao; Tang, Linlin; Ji, Bin; Zhang, Chuan; Cui, Daxiang; Ke, Yonggang; Song, Jie",Angewandte Chemie,https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202010433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894584/,672
118230,Case - Incorporating modern technology with traditional ceremony of Brit Milah during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-03-01,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS This article from Chapter 1 of the International Urogynecology Consultation (IUC) on Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) establishes the prevalence of lower urinary tract disorders, bowel symptoms, vulvo-vaginal/lower abdominal/back pain and sexual dysfunction in women with POP. METHODS An international group of nine urogynecologists/urologists and one medical student performed a search of the literature using pre-specified search terms in Ovid, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL from January 2000 to March 2019. Publications were eliminated if not relevant or they did not include clear definitions of POP or the symptoms associated with POP. Definitions of POP needed to include both a physical examination finding using a validated examination technique and the complaint of a bothersome vaginal bulge. Symptoms were categorized into symptom groups for ease of evaluation. The Specialist Unit for Review Evidence (SURE) was used to evaluate for quality of the included articles. The resulting list of articles was used to determine the prevalence of various symptoms in women with POP. Cohort studies were used to evaluate for possible causation of POP as either causing or worsening the symptom category. RESULTS The original search yielded over 12,000 references, of which 50 were used. More than 50% of women with POP report lower urinary tract symptoms. Cohort studies suggest that women with POP have more obstructive lower urinary tract symptoms than women without POP. Pain described in various ways is frequently reported in women with POP, with low back pain being the most common pain symptom reported in 45% of women with POP. In cohort studies those with POP had more pain complaints than those without POP. Sexual dysfunction is reported by over half of women with POP and obstructed intercourse in 37-100% of women with POP. Approximately 40% of women have complaints of bowel symptoms. There was no difference in the median prevalence of bowel symptoms in those with and without POP in cohort studies. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of lower urinary tract disorders, bowel symptoms, vulvo-vaginal/lower abdominal/back pain and sexual dysfunction in women with POP are common but inconsistently reported. There are few data on incidence of associated symptoms with POP, and cohort studies evaluating causality are rare or inconsistent. Obstructive voiding, lower abdominal and pelvic pain, and sexual dysfunction are most frequently associated with POP.","Harvey, Marie-Andrée; Chih, Hui Ju; Geoffrion, Roxana; Amir, Baharak; Bhide, Alka; Miotla, Pawel; Rosier, Peter F W M; Offiah, Ifeoma; Pal, Manidip; Alas, Alexandriah Nicole",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-021-04941-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34338825/,672

127467,Emergence of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 in China and the response in Mexico.,2020,"PURPOSE Impetigo affects approximately 162 million children worldwide at any given time. Lack of consensus on the most effective treatment strategy for impetigo and increasing antibiotic resistance continue to drive research into newer and alternative treatment options. We conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of new treatments for impetigo in endemic and nonendemic settings. METHODS We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Embase via Scopus for studies that explored treatments for bullous, nonbullous, primary, and secondary impetigo published between August 1, 2011, and February 29, 2020. We also searched online trial registries and hand-searched the reference lists of the included studies. We used the revised Cochrane risk of bias (version 2.0) tool for randomized trials and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute for nonrandomized uncontrolled studies to assess the risk of bias. FINDINGS We included 10 studies that involved 6651 participants and reported on 9 treatments in the final analysis. Most clinical trials targeted nonbullous impetigo or did not specify this. The risk of bias varied among the studies. In nonendemic settings, ozenoxacin 1% cream appeared to have the strongest evidence base compared with retapamulin and a new minocycline formulation. In endemic settings, oral co-trimoxazole and benzathine benzylpenicillin G injection were equally effective in the treatment of severe impetigo. Mass drug administration intervention emerged as a promising public health strategy to reduce the prevalence of impetigo in endemic settings. IMPLICATIONS This review highlights the limited research into new drugs used for the treatment of impetigo in endemic and nonendemic settings. Limited recent evidence supports the use of topical ozenoxacin or retapamulin for impetigo treatment in nonendemic settings, whereas systemic antibiotics and the mass drug administration strategy have evidence for use in endemic settings. Given the troubling increase in resistance to existing treatments, there is a clear need to ensure the judicious use of antibiotics and to develop new treatments and alternative strategies; this is particularly important in endemic settings.

This study aims to assess whether the use of doppler ultrasound, in cases with intermediate clinical suspicion of testicular torsion, can improve diagnostic accuracy compared to clinical assessment alone. METHODS We implemented a new clinical algorithm where patients with intermediate suspicion of testicular torsion undergo doppler ultrasound within 60 min. This study compared the patients that presented within one year prior to the implementation (group 1) to the patients who presented within one year after the implementation (group 2). The primary outcome measure was failure to confirm testicular torsion upon surgical exploration (negative surgical exploration). Missed testicular torsion was one of the secondary endpoints. RESULTS 590 consecutive patients were included. 322 (55%) in group 1 and 268 (45%) in group 2. There were 9 (2.8%) testicular torsions in group 1 vs 9 (3.4%) in group 2 (p = 0.69) and 2 (0.6%) missed testicular torsions in group 1 vs 0 in group 2 (p = 0.50). Doppler ultrasound was performed in 65 patients (24.2%) in group 2 vs 0 in group 1 (p < 0.01). Negative surgical exploration was performed in 27 (8.4%) patients in group 1 vs 8 (3.0%) in group 2 (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION Doppler ultrasound assessment of patients at intermediate clinical risk of testicular torsion significantly reduced the frequency of negative surgical explorations without increased rate of missed testicular torsions.","Teurneau-Hermansson, Karl; Zindovic, Igor; Jakobsson, Jon; Navntoft, Anders; Nozohor Ekmark, Ann; Salö, Martin; Wagenius, Magnus",Scandinavian journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1080/21681805.2021.1962404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369846/,672

There is a growing body of research that aims to understand the experiences of these parents, but the majority of this research is from mothers' perspectives, meaning that fathers' experiences are not well understood. OBJECTIVES To identify and synthesise findings from existing qualitative studies that have explored the experiences of fathers of children with a life-limiting condition. METHODS A systematic review of qualitative research was conducted using thematic synthesis. Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Social Science Citation Index. RESULTS Findings from 30 studies were included, representing the experiences of 576 fathers of children with a range of diagnoses including cancer, cystic fibrosis, genetic and neurological conditions. Themes detailed fathers' experiences of uncertainty and shock around the time of their child's diagnosis, their accounts of a 'new normal', difficulties in discussing their emotions, forming relationships with and seeking support from professionals and working fathers' role conflicts. They discussed the life-changing nature of their child's diagnosis, an event that affected all aspects of their lives from everyday activities, to their relationships, spirituality, values and ambitions. CONCLUSIONS Fathers experience many difficulties in response to their child's diagnosis and ongoing treatment. Findings highlight the need for healthcare professionals to recognise individual family dynamics and the evolving role of the father.

130569,[Caring for those who care for us].,2018,"SUMMARY In 1984, children presented to the emergency department of a hospital in the small town of Promissão, São Paulo State, Brazil, with an acute febrile illness that rapidly progressed to death. Local clinicians and public health officials recognized that these children had an unusual illness, which led to outbreak investigations conducted by Brazilian health officials in collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The studies that followed are an excellent example of the coordinated and parallel studies that are used to investigate outbreaks of a new disease, which became known as Brazilian purpuric fever (BPF). In the first outbreak investigation, a case-control study confirmed an association between BPF and antecedent conjunctivitis but the etiology of the disease could not be determined. In a subsequent outbreak, children with BPF were found to have bacteremia caused by Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius (H. aegyptius), an organism previously known mainly to cause self-limited purulent conjunctivitis. Molecular characterization of blood and other isolates demonstrated the clonal nature of the H. aegyptius strains that caused BPF, which were genetically distant from the diverse strains that cause only conjunctivitis. This led to an intense effort to identify the factors causing the unusual invasiveness of the BPF clone, which has yet to definitively identify the virulence factor or factors involved. After a series of outbreaks and sporadic cases through 1993, no additional cases of BPF have been reported.","Harrison, Lee H; Simonsen, Vera; Waldman, Eliseu A",Clinical microbiology reviews,https://doi.org/10.1128/cmr.00020-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18854482/,672

The approach leverages a knowledge graph of related concepts mined from a corpus of published evidence (PubMed) prior to the pandemic. Population trends from online searches were used to identify social determinants of health (SDoH) concepts that trended high at the outset of the pandemic from a list of SDoH topics from the World Health Organization (WHO). The trending concepts were then mapped to the knowledge graph and a subsequent analysis of the derived insights, spanning two years, was conducted. This paper suggests an approach to derive new related health and social factors that may have either played a role in, or been affected by, the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, our results show how, from a list of SDoH topics, Food Security, Unemployment trended the highest at the start of the pandemic.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the IntelliCuff against the manual technique for maintaining cuff pressure during simulated mechanical ventilation with and without movement. METHODS The IntelliCuff was compared to the manual technique of a manometer and syringe. Two independent studies were performed during mechanical ventilation: part 1, a 2-h trial incorporating continuous mannikin head movement; and part 2, an 8-h trial using a stationary trachea model. We set cuff pressure to 25 cm H2O, PEEP to 10 cm H2O, and peak inspiratory pressures to 20, 30, and 40 cm H2O. Clinical importance was defined as both statistically significant (P<.05) and clinically significant (pressure change [Δ]>10%). RESULTS In part 1, the change in cuff pressure from before to after ventilation was clinically important for the manual technique (P<.001, Δ=-39.6%) but not for the IntelliCuff (P=.02, Δ=3.5%). In part 2, the change in cuff pressure from before to after ventilation was clinically important for the manual technique (P=.004, Δ=-14.39%) but not for the IntelliCuff (P=.20, Δ=5.65%). CONCLUSIONS There was a clinically important drop in manually set cuff pressure during simulated mechanical ventilation in a stationary model and an even larger drop with movement, but this was significantly reduced by the IntelliCuff in both scenarios. Additionally, we observed that cuff pressure varied directly with inspiratory airway pressure for both techniques, leading to elevated average cuff pressures.","Chenelle, Christopher T; Oto, Jun; Sulemanji, Demet; Fisher, Daniel F; Kacmarek, Robert M",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.03387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25425705/,672

Care home residents are frequently exposed to infection due to contact with staff and other residents, and are highly susceptible to infection due to their age and co-morbidity. In England, official statistics suggest that at least 25% of all deaths in care home residents since the start of pandemic are linked to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but limited testing for SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic means estimates of the true burden of disease are lacking. Additionally, little is known about patterns of transmission between care homes, the community and hospitals, or the relationship between infection and immunity in care home staff and residents. The VIVALDI study plans to address these questions. VIVALDI is a prospective cohort study aiming to recruit 6,500 staff and 5000 residents from 105 care homes across England. Successive rounds of testing for infection will be performed over a period of 12 months. Nasopharyngeal swabs will detect evidence of viral RNA and therefore active infection (accompanied by collection of data on symptoms), whereas blood tests will detect antibodies and evidence of cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Whole genome sequencing of viral isolates to investigate pathways of transmission of infection is planned in collaboration with the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium. Qualitative interviews with care home staff will investigate the impact of the pandemic on ways of working and how test results influence infection control practices and behaviours. Data from residents and staff will be linked to national datasets on hospital admissions, antibody and PCR test results, mortality and care home characteristics. Data generated will support national public health efforts to prevent transmission of COVID-19 and protect care home staff and residents from infection.

This review explores obesity education in medical students, resident, and fellow physicians throughout the world from 2005 to 2018. Previous reviews on obesity education were conducted before 2011, focused solely on medical students, and only explored obesity education in the United States. We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and ERIC databases for studies which included the search terms ""obesity education"" AND either ""medical students"", ""residency"", or ""fellowship"" that met PICOS (Population, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes, Study Design) criteria for articles published in English for obesity education and evaluation of outcomes. Our initial search yielded 234 articles, and 27 studies met criteria for our review. We described and analyzed these studies for their study design and graded quality, quantity, and consistency for each measured outcome. We applied an evidence grading system that has been previously applied in the literature in which each outcome measure was graded on a scale from A to D. We evaluated obesity education programs for outcomes regarding implicit and explicit bias, changes in attitude towards obesity, weight change, obesity knowledge, counseling confidence, intent to counsel, and counseling quality. There was a significant degree of heterogeneity in the studies included. While obesity knowledge was most frequently studied, counseling confidence was the only outcome with an overall grade A. There is currently a paucity of obesity education programs for medical students, residents, and fellow physicians in training programs throughout the world despite high disease prevalence. However, these programs often improve outcomes when they are administered. Our review suggests that more obesity education should be administered in undergraduate and graduate medical education to ensure optimal treatment of patients with obesity.","Mastrocola, Marissa R; Roque, Sebastian S; Benning, Lauren V; Stanford, Fatima Cody",International journal of obesity,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-019-0453-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551484/,672

As the world focuses on limiting the spread of the virus and prioritizing acutely medically ill patients, containment measures are not without mental health consequences. With rising anxiety and depression, risk of suicide-acutely and in the aftermath of the pandemic-also rises. This article aims to shed light on this major public health problem and better understand what factors may create or exacerbate psychiatric symptoms and suicide. We review suicide data predating the pandemic and examine impact of previous epidemics on suicide rates. We then focus on the current pandemic's impacts and the world's response to COVID-19. We examine how these may lead to increased suicide rates, focusing on the US population. Finally, we offer suggestions on mitigating interventions to curb the impending rise in suicide and the resultant increased burden on an already stretched health care system.","Abi Zeid Daou, Margarita; Rached, Gaelle; Geller, Jeffrey",The Journal of nervous and mental disease,https://doi.org/10.1097/nmd.0000000000001338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33835950/,672

164368,International health regulations and compliance in Asia,2021,"The novel infectious disease (COVID-19) took only a few weeks from its official inception in December 2019 to become a global pandemic in early 2020. Countries across the world went to lockdown, and various strict measures were implemented to reduce the further spread of the infection. Although, the strict lockdown measures were aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19, however, Its positive implications were also observed for the environmental conditions across the global regions. The present study attempted to explore the eco-restoration of coastal marine system in response to reduced deposition of atmospheric nitrogen (NO2) emission during the substantial shift in human activities across the global metropolitan cities. Remotely data of NO2 emission were taken from Ozone Monitoring Instrument and the coastal water quality along the marine system was estimated from MODIS-Aqua Level-3 using Semi-Analytic Sediment Model (SASM). The changes in tropospheric NO2 in 2020s were also compared with the long-term average changes over the baseline period 2015 - 2019. A significant reduction in anthropogenic mobility (85 - 90%) has been observed in almost all countries over different places, especially grocery, parks, workplaces, and transit stations. A massive reduction in tropospheric NO2 was detected in Wuhan (53%), Berlin (42%), London (41%), Karachi (40%), Paris (38%), Santiago (35%), and Chennai (34%) during the strict lockdown period of the early 2020 as compared to the last five years. However, after the partial lockdown was lifted, tropospheric NO2 values bounced back and slightly increased over Karachi (6%) and Bremen (12%). For water turbidity, the rate of reduction was found to be the highest along the different coastal regions of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea (51%), West Atlantic Ocean (32%), East Atlantic Ocean (29%), and Indian Ocean (21%) from Apr to Jun 2020. The monthly comparison of overland-runoff in 2020 compared to 2019 across the different costal watersheds indicates that the observed decline in turbidity might have been due to the reduced deposition of atmospheric nitrogen. The findings of this study suggest that the recent decline in tropospheric NO2 and water turbidity might be associated with reduced emissions from fossil fuels and road transports followed by COVID-19 forced restrictions in the twenty-first century. The inferences made here highlight the hope of improving the global environmental quality by reducing greenhouse gas emissions using innovative periodic confinement measures on heavy transport and industries while securing public health and socioeconomics.","Mumtaz, F.; Arshad, A.; Mirchi, A.; Tariq, A.; Dilawar, A.; Hussain, S.; Shi, S.

Besides being daily companions, so-called mHealth applications have the potential to enable individuals to collect data, document issues, and share them with healthcare professionals to better adjust medical treatment, side effects, or quality of life. While patient empowerment should be a paramount goal, the setup of these applications in a reliable and communication-effective way is under discussion. In particular, including mHealth applications in the clinical practice routine is crucial to boost their development. Security concerns are of utmost importance as such applications deal with personal data. Considering the sensitive nature of many of the involved data, a trustworthy transfer protocol to the respective health care providers is essential to convince potential users. On the same grounds, healthcare providers, which represent another major stakeholder, might be sceptical of utilizing mHealth applications. This issue is often not prioritized by app developers, and there is a multitude of apps lacking clear and transparent data transfer concepts with a focus on both security and usability. In the following, we present and discuss two different approaches for managing and reporting sensitive clinical information and their secure inter-sectoral transfer. Both use cases are currently implemented into clinical practice, and their applicability is under constant evaluation. Besides, to empower inter-sectoral communication, both approaches have been developed in close collaboration with healthcare providers to maximize both communication and effectiveness of the mHealth applications. Based on our work, we conclude that while mHealth applications can be important in many aspects of improving health care, there are often significant limitations of mHealth-based communication, which can hamper its integration in clinical settings. To overcome these limitations, we show how to apply and re-elaborate on existing security and communication strategies. Finally, we highlight how these approaches can strengthen both patient and healthcare professionals’empowerment. CCBY","Schwab, J. D.; Schobel, J.; Werle, S.

Here we developed a machine learning-enabled pipeline for large-scale virtual screening that promises breakthroughs on both fronts. By clustering compounds according to molecular properties and limited docking against a drug target, the full library was trimmed by 10-fold; the remaining compounds were then screened individually by docking; and finally a dense neural network was trained to classify the hits into true and false positives. As illustration, we screened for inhibitors against RPN11, the deubiquitinase subunit of the proteasome and a drug target for breast cancer.

Especially, from the perspective of differential game theory, the flocking problem of different subgroups can be regarded as collision avoidance between neighboring agents, or obstacle avoidance between agents and virtual static/dynamic obstacles. To explore the internal mechanism of this interesting problem, a novel flocking algorithm with multiple virtual leaders is designed. The proposed algorithm is a modified version of the traditional flocking and semi-flocking algorithms. Based on the Lyapunov stability theorem and LaSalle's invariance principle, the stability analysis of the proposed algorithm is then proven. Furthermore, considering the complex environment that swarm robots or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may face when performing military missions such as surveillance, reconnaissance, and rescue, etc., we also investigate the flocking problem of multi-agents in both virtual static and dynamic obstacles environment. Finally, three kinds of simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.","Wei, H.; Chen, X. B.",Ieee Access,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.3022395,672
169761,Identification of novel mechanistically distinct endotypes of pandemic influenza-associated acute respiratory failure,2020-07-14,"Surveillance programs often use malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to determine the proportion of the population carrying parasites in their peripheral blood to assess the malaria transmission intensity. Despite an increasing number of reports on false-negative and false-positive RDT results, there is a lack of systematic quality control activities for RDTs deployed in malaria surveillance programs. Our study provides a larger scale comparative evaluation of RDTs used in the 2018 Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) conducted on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea. We conducted a molecular analysis by extraction of nucleic acids from 1,800 negative and 1,065 positive RDTs followed by qPCR analysis. These results were combined with a dataset collected in a comprehensive questionnaire from each MIS participant. Of the 2,865 RDTs that were collected in 2018 on Bioko Island and analysed in our study, 4.7% had a false-negative result. These false-negative RDT results were associated with low parasite density infections. In a substantial proportion of samples, we identified masked pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletions in which at least one P. falciparum strain carried a gene deletion. Among all positive RDTs analysed, 28.4% were tested negative by qPCR and therefore considered to be false-positive. Analysing the questionnaire data collected from the participants, this high proportion of false-positive RDT results could be explained by PfHRP2 antigen persistence after recent malaria treatment. We conclude that malaria surveillance depending solely on RDTs needs well-integrated quality control procedures assessing the extend and impact of reduced sensitivity and specificity of RDTs on malaria control programs.","Hosch, Salome; Yoboue, Charlene Aya; Donfack, Olivier Tresor; Guirou, Etienne A.; Dangy, Jean-Pierre; Mpina, Maxmillian; Nyakurungu, Elizabeth; Blöchliger, Koranan; Guerra, Carlos A.; Phiri, Wonder P.; Ayekaba, Mitoha Ondo’o; García, Guillermo A.; Tanner, Marcel; Daubenberger, Claudia; Schindler, Tobias",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.12.443950,672

Mobile applications (Apps) have shown early promise as patient education tools. In particular, 'Avatar'-based Apps, where a virtual, interactive 3D character serves as a teacher, have shown potential in other conditions such as ischaemic heart disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Methods A moderated, structured focus group of 8 HF patients and one patient carer was held to explore their experiences with patient education and identify areas in which HF education and knowledge of self-care was lacking. All participants shared their thoughts during moderated discussion, and recurring themes were identified. Participants then developed a 'curriculum' of topics that they considered most important in an educational App, with input from the HF team. Results Key themes that emerged from patients' prior experience of patient education included feelings of being overwhelmed and isolated during the initial diagnosis of HF, the importance of a trusted medium for accessing health information (and fear of misinformation), and 'a picture says a thousand words' - visual information was easier to absorb than text. The educational curriculum developed by participants prioritised the following areas: impact on lifestyle, medical management (including the importance of HF medicines), lifestyle changes and care planning, and self-management (including monitoring for signs of deterioration). A prototype App was developed in conjunction with Cognitant Group, using an Avatar (figure 1). The Avatar was designed to be a patient expert in HF, aged ∼65 years old. A living room setting was picked for the content for viewers to feel more relaxed. For Avatar movements to seem natural, voice and movements were recorded and synchronised using motion-capture technology. The first module entitled 'Living with heart failure' outlines of the following topics: explaining HF and the typical patient journey, the purpose of HF medications, lifestyle advice (including exercise and healthy eating, smoking and alcohol, sex and relationships), self-monitoring of HF symptoms, when to call for help and signposts to trusted HF educational resources. Acceptability of the App is currently being evaluated in the HF cohort at this specialist centre. Conclusions Avatar-based Apps may be a useful tool in patient education in HF when co-designed with patients. Further research will evaluate the acceptability of such an App to a cohort of patients in a specialist HF centre.","Singhal, A.; Tandon, J.; Ringrose, T.; Cowie, M.",Heart,https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2021-bcs.128,672

Specifically, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) attract a large number of people with respective enrollments meeting an exponential growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, only a small number of enrolled learners successfully complete their studies creating an interest in early prediction of dropout. This paper presents the findings of a study conducted during a MOOC for smart city professionals, in which we analyzed demographic and personal information on their own and in tandem with a small set of interaction data between learners and the MOOC, in order to identify factors influencing the decision of starting the MOOC or not. We also applied different models for predicting whether a person previously registered to a MOOC will eventually start it or not, as well as for identifying the most informative attributes for the prediction process. Results show that prediction reached 85% accuracy based only on the number of the first days’ logins in the MOOC and few demographic data such as current job role or occupation and number of study hours that the learner estimates he/she can devote on a weekly basis.

172793,Training wicked scientists for a world of wicked problems,2021,"Background: The National Cancer Institute supports several national trial networks which responded rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic to overcome operational barriers to clinical cancer research. The National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) focuses on late phase treatment trials, while the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) conducts early phase treatment trials. We report findings on the experience and adaptations of these networks during COVID-19. Methods: Using 2019 and 2020 accrual data, we analyzed changes in accrual levels and demographics. We also evaluated changes in trial activation numbers and timelines. In July 2020, we surveyed 255 investigators from academic and community sites to assess changes in research practices and get feedback on modified processes implemented by NCI to address trial conduct during the pandemic. Results: Accrual across the NCTN and ETCTN fell significantly in midMarch 2020, dropping from a weekly average of 307 patients in February to 169 the week of March 23-29. Accrual began to recover in June and July but did not return to pre-pandemic levels until September. Accrual in November and December 2020 followed the patterns seen in 2019, with short-term drops around major holidays. Non-White participants were enrolled to NCTN and ETCTN trials at similar monthly rates throughout 2019 and 2020, with slightly higher overall enrollment in 2020 (23.7% vs. 22.7%). New trials continued to be developed and activated throughout 2020. Between 2017 and 2019, an average of 71 trials were activated per year (NCTN = 46, ETCTN = 25), compared to 84 activated in 2020 (NCTN = 58, ETCTN = 26). The average time to trial activation was similar or slightly longer in 2020 compared to 2019. The investigator survey yielded 111 responses (43.5% response rate). 43% of respondents' sites paused enrollment to phase 1 trials during the pandemic, compared to 18% for phase 3 trials. Many sites temporarily stopped opening new trials and processing specimens. Sites were more likely to keep enrolling to trials offering clear potential benefit and pause complex trials that required more patient contact. Respondents attributed some of the decline in accrual to a reduction in overall patient volume, increased patient concerns, and reduced research staff on site. Respondents were asked to rate the usefulness of modified trial processes NCI put in place during the pandemic. Telehealth was rated most useful (avg. 4.6/5), followed by shipping oral IND agents to enrolled patients (4.5/5), remote informed consent (4.2/5), coordinating care with local providers (3.9/5), and remote auditing (3.7/5). Conclusions: The cancer trials community has an opportunity to learn from working through the challenges of COVID-19. NCI will seek to continue and expand on modifications to clinical trial processes that have the potential to improve operational efficiency, reduce cost, and help bring trials to more patients.","Mooney, M.

Part II,2021,"Background The rapidly accumulating disease susceptibility information collected from coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patient genomes must be urgently utilized to develop therapeutic interventions for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chromosome 12q24.13, which encodes the 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) family of proteins that sense viral genomic RNAs and trigger an antiviral response, is identified as one of the genomic regions that contains SNPs associated with COVID-19 severity. A high-risk SNP identified at the splice acceptor site of OAS1 exon 6 is known to change the proportions of the various splicing isoforms and the activity of the enzyme. Methods We employed in-silico motif search and RNA pull-down assay to define a factor responsible for the OAS1 splicing. Next, we rationally selected a candidate for slicing modulator to modulate this splicing. Results We found that inhibition of CDC-like kinase with a small chemical compound induces switching of OAS1 splice isoforms in human lung cells. In this condition, increased resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection, enhanced RNA degradation, and transcriptional activation of interferon β1, were also observed. Conclusions The results indicate the possibility of using chemical splicing modifiers aided by genome-based precision medicine to boost the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Iida, Kei; Ajiro, Masahiko; Muramoto, Yukiko; Takenaga, Toru; Denawa, Masatsugu; Kurosawa, Ryo; Noda, Takeshi; Hagiwara, Masatoshi",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.23.457314,672
173121,Isolation in the midst of a pandemic: social work students rapidly respond to community and field work needs,2020,"Purpose - In the COVID-19 pandemic, students were subjected to high pressure when they were forced to move to distance learning in a lockdown environment. Such a drastic move for communities living in groups with solid relationship ties comes at a price. This study aims to investigate the acceptance of distance learning amongst Omani higher education institutions (HEI) students during COVID-19 lockdown. Design/methodology/approach - This is a quantitative research based on an online survey designed to study participants' acceptance of distance learning during COVID-19 lockdown. Findings - A sample of 757 Omani students was selected, of which 81.2% were female. About 60% of the students' Age lies 15-20 years. The highest percentage (38.8%) of students belongs to the College of Arts and Humanities. A total of 80% of the students reported a moderate level of information technology skills, and also more than 80% of the students had never attended eLearning calls. Most of the students affirm the eLearning acceptance (students' willingness to use eLearning tools for the tasks they are designed for), eLearning usefulness (using eLearning would enhance students' performance), eLearning ease of use (the degree to which a student believes that using eLearning tools are free from effort), learning from home during COVID-19 and eLearning effectiveness (student's satisfaction and the benefits student will gain from learning via online platforms). Multiple regression analysis confirms that more than 81% of the variation in the eLearning acceptance was explained by eLearning usefulness, eLearning ease of use, learning from home during COVID-19 and eLearning effectiveness independent variables. Moreover, these independent predictors have a positive association with eLearning acceptance. Originality/value - This research intends to fill the gap in Omani HEI students' acceptance of distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mohamed, Ahhm Fattah Fama Bashir M. I.

173480,The behaviour of forex market during the first and second wave of COVID-19: a wavelet analysis,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to exacerbate food insecurity in low and middle-income countries, through loss of income and disrupted food supply chains. Lao PDR has among the highest rates of malnutrition in Southeast Asia. We assessed the relative difficulty in meeting food needs during the COVID-19 pandemic in rural districts of Luang Prabang Province, Lao PDR compared to before; determined associations between pandemic-associated difficulties in food access and household, maternal and child food security; and identified resiliency-promoting strategies. Methods: In November 2020, households (N = 1,122) with children under five years were interviewed. Respondents reported the relative ease of access of food and health care as well as changes in income and expenditures compared to before March 2020. We used generalized linear models with cluster robust standard errors to assess univariate and multivariate associations. Results: Nearly four-fifths (78.5%) found it harder to meet household food needs during the pandemic. The most common reasons were increased food prices (51.2%), loss of income (45.3%), and decreased food availability (36.6%). Adjusting for demographics, households with increased difficulty meeting food needs had lower food consumption scores and child dietary diversity. Over 85% of households lost income during the pandemic. Decreased expenditures was associated with reliance on more extreme coping strategies to meet food needs. The households who experienced no change in meeting food needs produced a greater percentage of their food from homegrown methods (4.22% more, 95% CI: 1.28, 7.15), than households who found it more difficult. We estimated that decreases in child bodyweight by 0.5 - 1% would increase wasting in this population by 1.7 - 2.1 percentage points. Conclusions: Pandemic-associated shocks may have large effects on malnutrition prevalence. Action is needed to mitigate consequences of the pandemic on nutrition. Local food production and safety net programs that offset income losses may help.","Head, J.

175278,Tele-oncology in cancer care during COVID-19 pandemic-expanding role in the developing world,2021,"We study the effects of an intervention aimed at identifying and containing outbreaks in a network model of contagion where social distance is endogenous. The intervention induces a fall in the risk of contagion, to which agents respond by reducing social distance. If the intervention relies on infrequent or inaccurate testing, this crowding out effect may fully offset the intervention’s direct effect, so that the risk of contagion increases. In these circumstances, we show that “slow” interventions – which allow the outbreak to spread to immediate neighbors before being contained – may generate higher ex-ante welfare than “fast” ones and may even “crowd in” social distance. The theory thus identifies a trade off between (i) the swiftness of the intervention and (ii) the scope for crowding out. Simulations on a real world network confirm that the infection rate is not necessarily monotonically decreasing in the accuracy of the intervention and that slow interventions may outperform fast ones for intermediate levels of accuracy.","Adriani, Fabrizio Ladley Dan",Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2021.08.003,672

The word appeared in the modern era, together with the emerging of a new type of individual versus the traditional one. In the second part, she focuses on the concept of responsibility, starting from the experience of coronavirus. During the pandemic, it has been among the most used words and it appeared as a multiform concept that includes respect, liberty, relationship, care, accountability, and as a basic principle of democratic life. It includes especially a form of reciprocity in care and respect. An interesting interweaving between legal obligation and moral responsibility as self-persuasion eventually arises. Human vulnerability emerged together with the necessity of responsibility as mutual concern and care of Earth. It comes out as a peculiar concept, which represents a coincidence of opposites, as autonomy and limit, freedom and bonds, rights and duties.","Franco, V.",Politica &amp; Societa,https://doi.org/10.4476/100803,672

Czeizel et al. 2011). Situational factors such as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) have also been reported to impact on individual’s mental health.ObjectivesExamine the effect of COVID-19 and its association with mental health and attempt suicide risk in pregnant population.MethodsA cross-sectional study that includes 113 pregnant women from Spain, through an anonymous, voluntary and multiple response type online survey which included questions about socio demographic aspects, COVID-19’s aspects and mental health.ResultsOf the 112 pregnant patients surveyed, only 2 reported suicidal ideation. The age of the respondents was 32 and 33 years, both of whom were in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy. Both report that it was the first pregnancy and affirm a worsening of their economic situation since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of them did not have a partner / marriage and was living with a relative, in turn this respondent was unemployed. Both responded that they were “always” worried about the possible outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic and that their fears had increased, being difficult to control and let them pass. It is very relevant that both agree that they “never” felt that the professionals who carried out the pregnancy controls asked or inquired about their current state of mental health.ConclusionsAntepartum suicidal ideation is an important and common complication of pregnancy, specially in COVID-19’s times, healthcare professionals who follow pregnancy should detect high-risk suicidal patients and be able to carry out a suicide prevention program.","Solis, M.

While the severity of most pulmonary viral infections, including influenza A virus (IAV), is linked to excessive inflammation, our mechanistic understanding of this observation remains largely unknown. Here we show that mitochondrial cyclophilin D (CypD) protects against IAV infection via disease tolerance. Mice deficient in CypD (CypD-/- mice) are significantly more susceptible to IAV infection despite comparable antiviral immunity. Instead, this susceptibility resulted from damage to the lung epithelial barrier caused by a significant reduction of IL-22 production by conventional NK cells in IAV-infected CypD-/- mice. Transcriptomic and functional data revealed that the compromised IL-22 production by NK cells resulted from dysregulated lymphopoiesis, stemming from increased cell death in NK cell progenitors, as well as the generation of immature NK cells that exhibited altered mitochondrial metabolism. Importantly, following IAV infection, administration of recombinant IL-22 abrogated pulmonary damage and enhanced survival of CypD-/- mice. Collectively, these results demonstrate a key role for CypD in NK cell-mediated disease tolerance.","Downey, Jeffrey; Randolph, Haley E.; Pernet, Erwan; Tran, Kim A.; Khader, Shabaana A.; King, Irah L.; Barreiro, Luis B.; Divangahi, Maziar",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.28.445832,672

However, little attention has been paid to the dynamic impact of pandemics on intercity travel and its recovery during a public health event period. Using intercity mobility and COVID-19 pandemic data, this study adopts the gradient boosting decision tree method to explore the dynamic effects of the COVID-19 on intercity travel in China. The influencing factors were classified into daily time-varying factors and time-invariant factors. The results show that China's intercity travel decreased on average by 51.35% from Jan 26 to Apr 7, 2020. Furtherly, the COVID-19 pandemic reduces intercity travel directly and indirectly by influencing industry development and transport connectivity. With the spread of COVID-19 and changes of control measures, the relationship between intercity travel and COVID-19, socio-economic development, transport is not linear. The relationship between intercity travel and secondary industry is illustrated by an inverted U-shaped curve from pre-pandemic to post-pandemic, whereas that with tertiary industry can be explained by a U-shaped curve. Meanwhile, this study highlights the dynamic effect of the COVID-19 on intercity mobility. These implications shed light on policies regarding the control measures during public health events that should include the dynamic impact of pandemics on intercity travel. © 2021","Li, T.; Wang, J.; Huang, J.; Yang, W.; Chen, Z.",Journal of Transport Geography,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2021.103153,672

185602,Premenstrual complaints before and after 40 years of age.,2004,"Arthrospira platensis (commonly known as spirulina) is a photosynthetic cyanobacterium1. It is a highly nutritious food that has been consumed for decades in the US, and even longer by indigenous cultures2. Its widespread use as a safe food source and proven scalability have driven frequent attempts to convert it into a biomanufacturing platform. But these were repeatedly frustrated by spirulina’s genetic intractability. We report here efficient and versatile genetic engineering methodology for spirulina that allows stable expression of bioactive protein therapeutics at high levels. We further describe large-scale, indoor cultivation and downstream processing methods appropriate for the manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals in spirulina. The potential of the platform is illustrated by pre-clinical development and human testing of an orally delivered antibody therapeutic against campylobacter, a major cause of infant mortality in the developing world and a growing antibiotic resistance threat3,4. This integrated development and manufacturing platform blends the safety of food-based biotechnology with the ease of genetic manipulation, rapid growth rates and high productivity characteristic of microbial platforms. These features combine for exceptionally low-cost production of biopharmaceuticals to address medical needs that are unfeasible with current biotechnology platforms.","Jester, Benjamin; Zhao, Hui; Gewe, Mesfin; Adame, Thomas; Perruzza, Lisa; Bolick, David; Agosti, Jan; Khuong, Nhi; Kuestner, Rolf; Gamble, Caitlin; Cruickshank, Kendra; Ferrara, Jeremy; Lim, Rachelle; Paddock, Troy; Brady, Colin; Ertel, Stacey; Zhang, Mia; Tasch, Michael; Saveria, Tracy; Doughty, David; Marshall, Jacob; Carrieri, Damian; Lee, Jamie; Goetsch, Lauren; Dang, Jason; Sanjaya, Nathaniel; Fletecher, David; Martinez, Anissa; Kadis, Bryce; Sigmar, Kristjian; Afreen, Esha; Nguyen, Tammy; Randolph, Amanda; Taber, Alexandria; Krzeszowski, Ashley; Robinett, Brittney; Grassi, Fabio; Guerrant, Richard; Spigarelli, Michael; Takeuchi, Ryo; Finrow, Brian; Behnke, Craig; Roberts, James",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.25.427910,672
185701,Has the present government delivered the health policy that it promised before it was elected?,2020-07-31,"The new coronavirus infection has shocked the world since early 2020 with its aggressive outbreak. Rapid detection of the disease saves lives, and relying on medical imaging (Computed Tomography and X-ray) to detect infected lungs has shown to be effective. Deep learning and convolutional neural networks have been used for image analysis in this context. However, accurate identification of infected regions has proven challenging for two main reasons. Firstly, the characteristics of infected areas differ in different images. Secondly, insufficient training data makes it challenging to train various machine learning algorithms, including deep-learning models. This paper proposes an approach to segment lung regions infected by COVID-19 to help cardiologists diagnose the disease more accurately, faster, and more manageable. We propose a bifurcated 2-D model for two types of segmentation. This model uses a shared encoder and a bifurcated connection to two separate decoders. One decoder is for segmentation of the healthy region of the lungs, while the other is for the segmentation of the infected regions. Experiments on publically available images show that the bifurcated structure segments infected regions of the lungs better than state of the art. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Yazdekhasty, P.; Zindari, A.; Nabizadeh-Shahrebabak, Z.; Roshandel, R.; Khadivi, P.; Karimi, N.; Samavi, S.","25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition Workshops, ICPR 2020",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-68790-8_46,672

Over 5 yr, 159 raccoons from a high-density raccoon population in St. Louis, Missouri (USA), were surveyed for exposure to canine distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus 1 (CAV-1); feline parvovirus (FPV; =feline panleukopenia), and several serovars of Leptospira interrogans. Exposure to each of the viruses and two Leptospira serovars (grippotyphosa and icterohemorrhagiae) was detected (prevalence of CDV = 54.1%; FPV = 49.7%; CAV-1 = 6.9%; L. interrogans icterohemorrhagiae = 8.9%; L. interrogans grippotyphosa = 6.3%). Eighty percent of raccoons showed evidence of exposure to at least one of the five primary pathogens, and 39% were positive for multiple species. Among the viruses, there was a significant co-occurrence of CDV and CAV-1. Longitudinal data on a subset of animals revealed that among individuals who were diagnosed as seropositive on first capture, 33-100% became seronegative for the pathogen of interest when reexamined at a later date. Thus, free-ranging urban raccoons have been exposed to multiple infectious agents, some of which may pose risks to humans and to nonvaccinated domestic and captive animal populations.","Junge, Randall E; Bauman, Karen; King, Melanie; Gompper, Matthew E",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17469271/,672

We enrolled 14 patients (16 lesions) who underwent intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided angiopeptin-eluting stent implantation in native coronary arteries between 3.0 and 4.0 mm in diameter with lesion length<or=18 mm. We successfully implanted 13 stents loaded with 22 microg of angiopeptin and three stents with 126 microg of angiopeptin. No major adverse cardiac events or target vessel failure occurred at 1-year clinical follow-up. All patients underwent 6-month angiographic and volumetric IVUS follow-up. In-stent late loss was 0.46+/-0.32 mm in the low-dose group and 0.26+/-0.14 mm in the high-dose group. Binary restenosis rate was 0%. Follow-up percentage neointimal hyperplasia by IVUS was 18.4%+/-22.5% for the low-dose group and 10.2%+/-5.8% for the high-dose group, respectively. There were no edge effect and late stent malapposition.

Although some procedures do not directly involve the lungs, e.g. oesophageal surgery, all consist of breaches in the integrity of one or both pleural cavities, whether in open thoracotomies or thoracoscopic procedures. Thus, hypoxia and hypercarbia are a constant threat. This is compounded by the fact that the patients are frequently elderly with chronic health problems and, consequently, poor anaesthetic risks. In view of this, an overview of respiratory anatomy and physiology will be given, followed by consideration of some of the anaesthetic strategies applied to meet the particular challenges of this surgical specialty.","Rooney, P",The British journal of theatre nursing : NATNews : the official journal of the National Association of Theatre Nurses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8695934/,672
193540,Stress and psychological distress among SARS survivors 1 year after the outbreak.,2007,"The accurate identification of T-cell epitopes remains a principal goal of bioinformatics within immunology. As the immunogenicity of peptide epitopes is dependent on their binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, the prediction of binding affinity is a prerequisite to the reliable prediction of epitopes. The iterative self-consistent (ISC) partial-least-squares (PLS)-based additive method is a recently developed bioinformatic approach for predicting class II peptide-MHC binding affinity. The ISC-PLS method overcomes many of the conceptual difficulties inherent in the prediction of class II peptide-MHC affinity, such as the binding of a mixed population of peptide lengths due to the open-ended class II binding site. The method has applications in both the accurate prediction of class II epitopes and the manipulation of affinity for heteroclitic and competitor peptides. The method is applied here to six class II mouse alleles (I-Ab, I-Ad, I-Ak, I-As, I-Ed, and I-Ek) and included peptides up to 25 amino acids in length. A series of regression equations highlighting the quantitative contributions of individual amino acids at each peptide position was established. The initial model for each allele exhibited only moderate predictivity. Once the set of selected peptide subsequences had converged, the final models exhibited a satisfactory predictive power. Convergence was reached between the 4th and 17th iterations, and the leave-one-out cross-validation statistical terms--q2, SEP, and NC--ranged between 0.732 and 0.925, 0.418 and 0.816, and 1 and 6, respectively. The non-cross-validated statistical terms r2 and SEE ranged between 0.98 and 0.995 and 0.089 and 0.180, respectively.

METHODS: This prospective study enrolled children aged 2-59 months admitted to the Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital with World Health Organization (WHO)-defined clinical pneumonia. Demographic and clinico-radiological data were collected through questionnaires, physical examination, and chest radiography. Blood samples and nasopharyngeal washing were collected for microbiological analysis including culture and molecular methods. RESULTS: From July 2017 to June 2018, 189 children were enrolled, of which 53.4% were infants. Pneumonia-related admissions were less frequent over the winter. Chest radiographies were obtained in 149 children; endpoints included pneumonia in 39 cases (26.2%), other infiltrates in 31 (20.8%), and were normal in 79 children (53.0%). Non-contaminated bacterial growth was detected in 8/152 (5.3%) blood cultures, with only two cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Viral detection in upper respiratory secretions was common, with at least one virus detected in 103/115 (89.6%). The three most-commonly isolated viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (52/115; 45.2%), rhinovirus (42/115; 36.5%), and human parainfluenza virus (19/115; 16.5%).

We used a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) and SARS-CoV-2 S protein-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vector-based neutralization assay (pVNT) to assess the degree to which serum antibodies from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent patients interfere with the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S to ACE2. Both tests revealed neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies in the sera of ~90% of mildly and 100% of severely affected COVID-19 convalescent patients. Importantly, sVNT and pVNT results correlated strongly with each other and to the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG and IgA antibodies. Moreover, levels of neutralizing antibodies correlated with the duration and severity of clinical symptoms but not with patient age. Compared to pVNT, sVNT is less sophisticated and does not require any biosafety labs. Since this assay is also much faster and cheaper, sVNT will not only be important for evaluating the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies in a population but also for identifying promising plasma donors for successful passive antibody therapy.","Bosnjak, Berislav; Stein, Saskia Catherina; Willenzon, Stefanie; Cordes, Anne Katrin; Puppe, Wolfram; Bernhardt, Günter; Ravens, Inga; Ritter, Christiane; Schultze-Florey, Christian R; Gödecke, Nina; Martens, Jörg; Kleine-Weber, Hannah; Hoffmann, Markus; Cossmann, Anne; Yilmaz, Mustafa; Pink, Isabelle; Hoeper, Marius M; Behrens, Georg M N; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Blasczyk, Rainer; Schulz, Thomas F; Förster, Reinhold",Cell. mol. immunol.

We further examine the moderating role of neighbourhood environment and this distress. We find that people living in infected communities tend to perceive higher level of psychological distress compared to people living in uninfected communities. People's expected duration of COVID-19 is associated with higher psychological distress and this is partially moderated by the perception of neighbourhood noise level and overall environment quality. Additional results quantify the evidence that a quiet and well maintained neighbourhood environment could reduce the negative influences of expectation of a long duration of COVID-19 on people's psychological distress.","Chen, Yiyi; Jones, Colin; Dunse, Neil",Sci Total Environ,,672

208132,Educating Future Doctors in Covid-19 Times: Anatomists Lead the Way!,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since March 11, 2020 when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of infected cases, the number of deaths, and the number of affected countries have climbed rapidly. To understand the impact of COVID-19 on public health, many studies have been conducted for various countries. To complement the available work, in this article we examine Canadian COVID-19 data for the period of March 18, 2020 to August 16, 2020 with the aim to forecast the dynamic trend in a short term. METHOD: We focus our attention on Canadian data and analyze the four provinces, Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec, which have the most severe situations in Canada. To build predictive models and conduct prediction, we employ three models, smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) models, neural network (NN) models, and susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) models, to fit time series data of confirmed cases in the four provinces separately. In comparison, we also analyze the data of daily infections in two states of USA, Texas and New York state, for the period of March 18, 2020 to August 16, 2020. We emphasize that different models make different assumptions which are basically difficult to validate. Yet invoking different models allows us to examine the data from different angles, thus, helping reveal the underlying trajectory of the development of COVID-19 in Canada. FINDING: The examinations of the data dated from March 18, 2020 to August 11, 2020 show that the STAR, NN, and SIR models may output different results, though the differences are small in some cases. Prediction over a short term period incurs smaller prediction variability than over a long term period, as expected. The NN method tends to outperform other two methods. All the methods forecast an upward trend in all the four Canadian provinces for the period of August 12, 2020 to August 23, 2020, though the degree varies from method to method. This research offers model-based insights into the pandemic evolvement in Canada.","Chen, Li-Pang; Zhang, Qihuang; Yi, Grace Y; He, Wenqing",PLoS One,,672

Measures to increase the efficacy and reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the healthcare setting,2020,"As of 15 August 2020, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported in >21 million people world-wide and is responsible for more than 750,000 deaths. The occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 has been reported to be as high as 43%. This is comparable to AKI in other forms of pneumonia requiring hospitalization, as well as in non-infectious conditions like cardiac surgery. The impact of AKI on COVID-19 outcomes is difficult to assess at present but, similar to other forms of sepsis, AKI is strongly associated with hospital mortality. Indeed, mortality is reported to be very low in COVID-19 patients without AKI. Given that AKI contributes to fluid and acid-base imbalances, compromises immune response and may impair resolution of inflammation, it seems likely that AKI contributes to mortality in these patients. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of AKI in COVID-19 are thought to be multifactorial including systemic immune and inflammatory responses induced by viral infection, systemic tissue hypoxia, reduced renal perfusion, endothelial damage and direct epithelial infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. Mitochondria play a central role in the metabolic deregulation in the adaptive response to the systemic inflammation and are also found to be vital in response to both direct viral damage and tissue reperfusion. These stress conditions are associated with increased glycolysis and reduced fatty acid oxidation. Thus, there is a strong rationale to target AKI for therapy in COVID-19. Furthermore, many approaches that have been developed for other etiologies of AKI such as sepsis, inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion, have relevance in the treatment of COVID-19 AKI and could be rapidly pivoted to this new disease.","Kellum, John A; van Till, J W Olivier; Mulligan, George",Nephrol Dial Transplant,,672

213562,BASTA! Reflexões em torno da Covid-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the absence of a safe, effective vaccine, the worldwide spread of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection will continue. Laboratory tests with ideal precision, sensitivity, and specificity should be used in public health and clinical settings to gauge the extent of virus exposure. Toward this end, we evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and the Roche Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays. METHODS: Quality control, pooled COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 patient specimens were used for the imprecision study. 246 specimens from 70 patients with COVID-19 diagnosis were tested to study the sensitivity. 73 non-COVID-19 control specimens were measured to study the specificity. All specimens were analyzed by both assays. RESULTS: Total analytic variability (CV) of the negative and positive controls were 5.5% and 3.6% for the Abbott assay and 4.5% and 1.9% for the Roche assay. Both assays demonstrated 100% qualitative reproducibility of negative and positive controls. The clinical specificities of the Abbott and the Roche assays were 100% (95% CI: 94% - 100%) and 97% (95% CI: 90% - 100%), respectively. The clinical sensitivities of the Abbott assay were 49% (95% CI: 41% - 56%), 86% (95% CI: 74% - 93%) and 100% (95% CI: 76% - 100%) for samples collected at 0-6 days, 7-13 days and &#8805;14 days after the first RT-PCR, while the sensitivities of the Roche assay were 55% (95% CI: 47% - 62%), 86% (95% CI: 74% - 93%) and 100% (95% CI: 76% - 100%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates similar analytical and clinical performance of the Abbott and the Roche SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays, but the Roche assay may be slightly more sensitive for patients tested within 0-6 days after first positive RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2.","Yang, Jianbo; Pederson, Edward C; Hamilton, Christopher; Neibauer, Terri; Robyak, Kimberly; McGhee, Pamela; Speicher, Teresa; Zhu, Yusheng",,,672

217488,Controversial medical licensing exam cancelled,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus continues to spread and evolve across the planet. The crosscutting impacts of the virus, individual country responses to the virus, and the state of preparedness of local public health systems greatly vary across the world. The ostensibly late arrival of the virus in Africa has allowed learning, innovation, and adaptation of methods that have been successful in the early-hit countries. This article analyzes how Singapore has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and proposes that adaptations of the Singapore pandemic response model would bode well for Africa's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in ways that also take into account regional differences in health care infrastructures, socioeconomic resilience, poverty, and the vast population diversity in the African continent. As the pandemic evolves, the lessons learned in Asia, in particular, and the emerging new experiences in African countries should inform, ideally in real time, how best to steer the world populations into safety, including those in low-resource health care settings. Finally, we note that the current COVID-19 pandemic is also a test for our collective ability to scale and surge public health in response to future and likely equally challenging zoonosis infections that jump from animals to humans, not to mention climate change-related planetary health calamities in the 21st century. Hence, what we learn effectively from the current COVID-19 pandemic shall have broad, enduring, and intergenerational relevance for the future of planetary heath and society.","Kuguyo, Oppah; Kengne, Andre Pascal; Dandara, Collet",OMICS,,672
219138,Presentación de dos pacientes con enfermedad COVID-19,2020,"Vaccines are essential to control the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to protect the vulnerable population. However, one safety concern of vaccination is the possible development of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potential infection of Fc receptor bearing cells such as macrophages, would support continued virus replication and inflammatory responses, and thereby potentially worsen the clinical outcome of COVID-19. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV neither infect human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) nor induce inflammatory cytokines in these cells, in sharp contrast to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and the common cold human coronavirus 229E. Furthermore, serum from convalescent COVID-19 patients neither induced enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection nor innate immune response in hMDM. Although, hMDM expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, no or very low levels of transmembrane protease serine 2 were found. These results support the view that ADE may not be involved in the immunopathological processes associated with COVID-19, however, more studies are necessary to understand the potential contribution of antibodies-virus complexes with other cells expressing FcR receptors.","García-Nicolás, Obdulio; V039,; kovski, Philip; Zettl, Ferdinand; Zimmer, Gert; Thiel, Volker; Summerfield, Artur",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,672

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies suggest possible protection against re-infections in prior SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this prospective observational study were to longitudinally assess the antibody response during the first 4-6 months after polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to study the diagnostic performance of four different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) in symptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) with non-severe COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: HCWs in a teaching hospital were included between March 8 and June 15, 2020, when they had a PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the past 3 months. The performances of four ELISAs (Wantai, Bio-Rad Platelia, BioTrading Immy clarus, and Euroimmun) were evaluated in serum samples obtained at the moment of study inclusion and subsequently at 1, 2 and 3 months thereafter. Furthermore, in the last available serum sample sVNT by GenScript was performed. RESULTS: 309 samples from 80 positive HCWs were included of whom 70 (88%) were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. The detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by the different ELISAs were heterogenous ranging from 64% for the Euroimmun ELISA to 88% for the Wantai ELISA. The Wantai ELISA had the highest and almost perfect agreement with sVNT (96%, Cohen's kappa 0.83). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 (neutralizing) antibodies were detectable in most symptomatic individuals with non-severe COVID-19. The presence of antibodies remained stable up to six months after initial infection. There is large variability in diagnostic test performance between ELISA tests.","Ong, David S Y; Keuren, Frans; van der Vliet, Marijke; Boxma-de Klerk, Bianca M; Koeleman, Johannes G M",J Clin Virol,,672

Since that time, the 'suspicious suspects' in the endoscopy unit have grown in number in the eyes of both patients and endoscopists. RECENT FINDINGS: This review summarizes the existing guidelines related to infection control in the endoscopy unit and emerging technologies to address gaps, identifies recommendations proposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and reminds the reader that infection prevention has not changed since the emergence of COVID-19, only the importance of infection prevention has increased in visibility. SUMMARY: Infection prevention has been and will always be necessary in the gastrointestinal endoscopy unit. Although outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant organisms and infectious diseases like COVID-19 raise the profile of infection control, there have been no major changes to infection control practice recommendations because of the global pandemic. The history of lapses in infection control, persistent contamination of reprocessed endoscopes, and failure of many endoscopy units to identify certain endoscopic procedures as aerosol-generating procedures prior to the pandemic emphasize the need for better knowledge and implementation of infection control practices within endoscopy units.","Hutfless, Susan",Curr Opin Gastroenterol,,672

Concentrations of air pollutants were obtained from 21 monitoring stations for the period from 5 January 2019 to 5 August 2019, representing normal conditions unaffected by COVID-19, and the period 5 January 2020 to 5 August 2020, i.e., during the COVID-19 crisis. We concentrated our analysis on three time windows (23 February 2020 to 15 March 2020, 18 March 2020 to 3 April 2020, and 5 April 2020 to 17 April 2020) during the lockdown when different sets of measures were taken to limit the spread of COVID-19. In comparison to the period not affected by COVID-19 measures, mean concentrations of pollutants were increased during the first lockdown period; when the number of COVID-19 patients increased sharply compared to the other periods, the mean surface concentrations of NO2, SO2, and CO were decreased and concentrations of other pollutants (i.e., O3, PM10, and PM2.5) were increased during the second lockdown period compared to the corresponding period in 2019. In the third period, the mean concentrations were decreased compared to the corresponding period in 2019. For the full period, decreases in mean concentrations of O3, NO2, SO2, CO, and PM10 and increases in PM2.5 were observed during the COVID-19 crisis, compared to 2019. Overall, the strongest reductions, 12% and 6%, respectively, were observed for CO and NO2, pointing to reduced emissions from traffic as a result of lockdown measures. The concentrations of other pollutants changed little, suggesting that the lockdown measures did not result in strong changes in the emissions from stationary sources.","Borhani, Faezeh; Shafiepour Motlagh, Majid; Stohl, Andreas; Rashidi, Yousef; Ehsani, Amir Houshang",Environ Monit Assess,,672

After identification of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Pudong on January 21, 2020, the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched a case investigation involving isolation, close-contact (CC) tracing and quarantine of persons with a potential exposure risk to prevent and control transmission. Epidemiological features of cases detected by three different strategies were compared to assess the impact of these active surveillance measures. As of February 16, 2020, a total of 108 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been identified in Pudong, Shanghai. Forty-five (41.67%) cases were identified through active surveillance measures, with 22 (20.37%) identified by CC tracing and 23 (21.30%) by quarantine of potential exposure populations (PEPs). The average interval from illness onset to the first medical visit was 1 day. Cases identified by CC tracing and PEPs were quarantined for 0.5 and 1 day before illness onset, respectively. The time intervals from illness onset to the first medical visit and isolation among actively screened cases were 2 days (p = .02) and 3 days (p = .00) shorter, respectively, than those among self-admission cases. Our study highlights the importance of active surveillance for potential COVID-19 cases, as demonstrated by shortened time intervals from illness onset to both the first medical visit and isolation. These measures contributed to the effective control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Pudong, Shanghai.","Liu, Hanzhao; Ye, Chuchu; Wang, Yuanping; Zhu, Weiping; Shen, Yifeng; Xue, Caoyi; Zhang, Hong; Zhang, Yanyan; Li, Shihong; Zhao, Bing; Xu, Hongmei; Hao, Lipeng; Zhou, Yixin",J. med. virol,,672

These actions are reducing the number of coronics, but with the prolonged COVID-19 outbreak, the restrictions on the activities of people are having a significant impact on all industries. Accordingly, this study aimed to statistically analyze changes in building energy consumption under the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, as well as identify the relationship between COVID-19 and building energy consumption according to the building use type. As a result, the average rate of changes in electricity and gas energy consumption decreased −4.46% and −10.35%, respectively, compared to the previous year. The energy consumption in most facilities has tended to decrease while energy consumption in residential facilities increased during COVID-19. The rate of change in building energy consumption had a significantly positive correlation with COVID-19 related factors in various facilities (e.g., neighborhood, religious, educational, and research facilities). Significant findings of this study that social distancing by the COVID-19 outbreak, has changed energy consumption according to building use type indicates the need for new energy systems to effectively manage the energy demand at the community level in the Post COVID-19 era.","Kang, Hyuna An Jongbaek Kim Hakpyeong Ji Changyoon Hong Taehoon Lee Seunghye",Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,,672

231510,"Using Seismic Noise Levels to Monitor Social Isolation: An Example From Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",2020,"A number of nations were forced to declare a total shutdown due to COVID-19 infection, as extreme measure to cope with dramatic impact of the pandemic, with remarkable consequences both in terms of negative health outcomes and economic loses. However, in many countries a ""Phase-2"" is approaching and many activities will re-open soon, although with some differences depending on the severity of the outbreak experienced and SARS-COV-2 estimated diffusion in the general population. At the present, possible relapses of the epidemic cannot be excluded until effective vaccines or immunoprophylaxis with human recombinant antibodies will be properly set up and commercialized. COVD-19-related quarantines have triggered serious social challenges, so that decision makers are concerned about the risk of wasting all the sacrifices imposed to the people in these months of quarantine. The availability of possible early predictive indicators of future epidemic relapses would be very useful for public health purposes, and could potentially prevent the suspension of entire national economic systems. On 16 March, a Position Paper launched by the Italian Society of Environmental Medicine (SIMA) hypothesized for the first time a possible link between the dramatic impact of COVID-19 outbreak in Northern Italy and the high concentrations of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) that characterize this area, along with its well-known specific climatic conditions. Thereafter, a survey carried out in the U.S. by the Harvard School of Public Health suggested a strong association between increases in particulate matter concentration and mortality rates due to COVID-19. The presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA on the particulate matter of Bergamo, which is not far from Milan and represents the epicenter of the Italian epidemic, seems to confirm (at least in case of atmospheric stability and high PM concentrations, as it usually occurs in Northern Italy) that the virus can create clusters with the particles and be carried and detected on PM10. Although no assumptions can be made concerning the link between this first experimental finding and COVID-19 outbreak progression or severity, the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA on PM10 of outdoor air samples in any city of the world could represent a potential early indicator of COVID-19 diffusion. Searching for the viral genome on particulate matter could therefore be explored among the possible strategies for adopting all the necessary preventive measures before future epidemics start.","Setti, Leonardo; Passarini, Fabrizio; De Gennaro, Gianluigi; Barbieri, Pierluigi; Pallavicini, Alberto; Ruscio, Maurizio; Piscitelli, Prisco; Colao, Annamaria; Miani, Alessandro",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,672

This framework centers on data science, computer science, and multidisciplinary convergence as tools for engaging K-12 students in complex societal problems like the pandemic. In this theoretical position statement, we propose our framework that is grounded in three areas: (a) data science and computer science, (b) multidisciplinary convergence, and (c) orientation and support for science teachers specifically and STEM teachers broadly to prepare them for fundamentally different roles. Using data and computer models, students find phenomena and problems compelling, appreciate the power and potential of STEM subjects, and explain phenomena and design solutions to real-world problems. Then, through multidisciplinary convergence, individuals and societies integrate STEM disciplinary knowledge and practices to make informed decisions and take responsible actions. As STEM teachers engage students in explaining phenomena and solving complex societal problems with data science and computer science through the convergence of multiple STEM subjects, teachers take on roles that are fundamentally different from the roles they have traditionally played.","Lee, Okhee; Campbell, Todd",J.

METHODS: The first part of the article describes a case of COVID-19 in our patient after a recent kidney transplant. The second part of the article presents the outcome of literature search from multiple resources from April 2020 until March 2021. Abstracts were screened, followed by full-text review with data extraction. Part 2 discusses current treatment options of COVID-19, and part 3 refers to this treatment application in patients after solid organ transplant. RESULTS: We have summarized 45 studies from China, France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Mortality rates from published studies were variable. Based on early data from Spain, 42% of patients who developed COVID-19 within 60 days of transplant died. According to results of the European Renal Association COVID-19 Database collaboration group, the 28-day COVID-19-related mortality is 21.3% for kidney transplant recipients, which is still markedly higher than what is observed in other populations. Acute kidney injury was common, and mycophenolate mofetil and mammalian target of rapamycin were discontinued in most patients. CONCLUSIONS: Effective therapy has been sought since the outbreak of the pandemic, and at the same time intensive work has been done to produce a vaccine that could effectively protect against the disease. Summing up the efforts of numerous groups of researchers from around the world that have been continued since the beginning of 2020, we may assume the following: (1) we still do not have causal drugs that would reduce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication and allow its complete elimination, but antispike monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 seem to be very promising, and (2) the withdrawal of antiproliferative and antimetabolic drugs and the continuation of steroids and calcineurin inhibitors is now a commonly accepted approach in patients after organ transplant.","Kedzierska-Kapuza, Karolina; Zielinska, Dorota; Matejak-Górska, Marta; Durlik, Marek",Transplant Proc,,672

235960,Recomendaciones SEPAR sobre la vacuna COVID-19 en las enfermedades respiratorias◊,2021,"Mobile applications have increasingly entered the healthcare sector. Besides being daily companions, so-called mHealth applications have the potential to enable individuals to collect data, document issues, and share them with healthcare professionals to better adjust medical treatment, side effects, or quality of life. While patient empowerment should be a paramount goal, the setup of these applications in a reliable and communication-effective way is under discussion. In particular, including mHealth applications in the clinical practice routine is crucial to boost their development. Security concerns are of utmost importance as such applications deal with personal data. Considering the sensitive nature of many of the involved data, a trustworthy transfer protocol to the respective health care providers is essential to convince potential users. On the same grounds, healthcare providers, which represent another major stakeholder, might be skeptical of utilizing mHealth applications. This issue is often not prioritized by app developers, and there is a multitude of apps lacking clear and transparent data transfer concepts with a focus on both security and usability. In the following, we present and discuss two different approaches for managing and reporting sensitive clinical information and their secure inter-sectoral transfer. Both use cases are currently implemented into clinical practice, and their applicability is under constant evaluation. Besides, to empower inter-sectoral communication, both approaches have been developed in close collaboration with healthcare providers to maximize both communication and effectiveness of the mHealth applications. Based on our work, we conclude that while mHealth applications can be important in many aspects of improving health care, there are often significant limitations of mHealth-based communication, which can hamper its integration in clinical settings. To overcome these limitations, we show how to apply and re-elaborate on existing security and communication strategies. Finally, we highlight how these approaches can strengthen both patient and healthcare professionals' empowerment.","Schwab, J. D.; Schobel, J.; Werle, S.

METHODS: Sixteen consecutively hospitalized third-trimester pregnant women with pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, rheumatoid arthritis or connective tissue disease were selected as the study subjects for the simulation of COVID-19 pneumonia. Two physicians (imaging and internal medicine) without ultrasonic experience performed lung examinations on pregnant women after six days of lung ultrasound training, and their consistency with examinations by the expert was assessed. In addition, 54 healthy third-trimester pregnant women and 54 healthy nonpregnant women of the same age who were continuously treated in the outpatient clinic of this hospital were selected for comparisons of abnormalities on lung ultrasound. RESULTS: (1) Third trimester pregnant women with pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, rheumatoid arthritis or connective tissue disease had the same lung ultrasound patterns as those associated with COVID-19 pneumonia. (2) There was no statistically significant difference between the scores of the two trained doctors and the expert when the modified ultrasound scoring system was used (p > .05). (3) The evaluations of the two trained doctors and the expert showed good consistency (kappa value = 0.833-0.957). (4) The incidence of abnormal ultrasound manifestations of the pleura and lung parenchyma was higher among healthy third-trimester pregnant women than among healthy women of the same age (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: After receiving short-term training, imaging and internal medicine physicians can use the modified lung ultrasound scoring system to evaluate pregnant women's pulmonary damage, but caution is needed to avoid false-positive results among pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia.","Zhang, Ying; Lyu, Guorong; Kang, Zhuo; Huang, Yijun; Wang, Zhenhua; Yang, Wenmin",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,672

240812,Principais medidas tomadas para a mudança dos processos assistenciais durante a pandemia por COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the drug of choice for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis and has activity against other opportunistic infections after solid organ transplant (SOT). We aimed to describe the incidence, reasons for and outcomes of use of alternative prophylactic agents (APAs) across SOT programs in our high volume centers. METHODS: SOT recipients (SOTRs) at our centers from 1/2015-12/2016 were identified. Pharmacy records identified APA (pentamidine, atovaquone, or dapsone) use within one year. Records were reviewed for allergies, laboratory values at APA initiation, diagnostic tests for TMP-SMX -preventable opportunistic infections (OIs), and APA side effects. RESULTS: An APA was initiated in 105/1173 (8.9%) SOTRs. Of these, 51 (48.6%) were due to sulfonamide allergy recorded pre- SOT, mostly rash/hives (58.8%). The remaining 54 (51.4%) had TMP-SMX discontinued post-SOT, mostly for neutropenia (48%) and renal effects (34%). Differences occurred across programs, with kidney transplant never stopping TMP-SMX for renal issues. Of those changed to APAs post-transplant, 19 (35%) were later successfully re-challenged with TMP-SMX. With thresholds in mind, 67 (64%) received an APA unnecessarily, accounting for up to $100,000/year excess cost. Potential TMP-SMX -preventable OIs occurred in 7 (5 Nocardia; 2 PJP). APA side effects occurred in 14/105 (13.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of APAs for PJP prophylaxis after SOT is less than previously reported but often unwarranted. Such decisions require scrutiny to avoid TMP-SMX -preventable OIs, cost and important APA side effects. Use of reasonable thresholds for cessation of TMP-SMX and data-driven approaches to re-challenge would substantially reduce APA use.","Lum, Jessica; Echenique, Ignacio; Athans, Vasilios; Koval, Christine E",Transpl Infect Dis,,672

SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Small studies suggest that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers may upregulate the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, affecting susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. This may be of great importance considering the large number of patients worldwide who are treated with RAS blockers, and the well-proven clinical benefit of these treatments in several cardiovascular conditions. In contrast, RAS blockers have also been associated with better outcomes in pneumonia models, and may be beneficial in COVID-19. This review sought to analyse the evidence regarding RAS blockers in the context of COVID-19 and to perform a pooled analysis of the published observational studies to guide clinical decision making. A total of 21 studies were included, comprising 11,539 patients, of whom 3417 (29.6%) were treated with RAS blockers. All-cause mortality occurred in 587/3417 (17.1%) patients with RAS blocker treatment and in 982/8122 (12.1%) patients without RAS blocker treatment (odds ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.69-1.45; P=0.49; I2=84%). As several hypotheses can be drawn from experimental analysis, we also present the ongoing randomized studies assessing the efficacy and safety of RAS blockers in patients with COVID-19. In conclusion, according to the current data and the results of the pooled analysis, there is no evidence supporting any harmful effect of RAS blockers on the course of patients with COVID-19, and it seems reasonable to recommend their continuation.","Kerneis, Mathieu; Ferrante, Arnaud; Guedeney, Paul; Vicaut, Eric; Montalescot, Gilles",Arch Cardiovasc Dis,,672

243043,COVÍD-19 PANDEMÍSÍ: PSÍKOLOJÍK ETKÍLERÍ VE TERAPÖTÍK MÜDAHALELER,2020,"Dynamic graph representation learning is a task to learn node embeddings over dynamic networks, and has many important applications, including knowledge graphs, citation networks to social networks. Graphs of this type are usually large-scale but only a small subset of vertices are related in downstream tasks. Current methods are too expensive to this setting as the complexity is at best linear-dependent on both the number of nodes and edges. In this paper, we propose a new method, namely Dynamic Personalized PageRank Embedding (\textsc{DynamicPPE}) for learning a target subset of node representations over large-scale dynamic networks. Based on recent advances in local node embedding and a novel computation of dynamic personalized PageRank vector (PPV), \textsc{DynamicPPE} has two key ingredients: 1) the per-PPV complexity is $\mathcal{O}(m \bar{d} / \epsilon)$ where $m,\bar{d}$, and $\epsilon$ are the number of edges received, average degree, global precision error respectively. Thus, the per-edge event update of a single node is only dependent on $\bar{d}$ in average; and 2) by using these high quality PPVs and hash kernels, the learned embeddings have properties of both locality and global consistency. These two make it possible to capture the evolution of graph structure effectively. Experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method over large-scale dynamic networks. We apply \textsc{DynamicPPE} to capture the embedding change of Chinese cities in the Wikipedia graph during this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic). Our results show that these representations successfully encode the dynamics of the Wikipedia graph.","Guo, Xingzhi; Zhou, Baojian; Skiena, Steven",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01570v1.pdf,672

METHODOLOGY: A systematic review of articles on the novel coronavirus, containing information on obesity and its association with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. In the bibliographic research, four databases were used, with the terms ['COVID-19'] AND ['hospitalization'] AND ['obesity'] AND ['mortality']. Studies published from 12/01/2019 until 05/01/2020 were included. The research contains inclusive criteria targeting studies of humans adults infected by Sars-Cov-2, with or without comorbidities. This research was selected from publications in Spanish and English languages. RESULTS: 96 articles were identified, 15 being presented in two databases. Twenty articles were included, with a population total estimated from 1 to 7671 patients, with a prevalence of obesity ranging from 13.3% to 68.6%. The association of obesity and mortality has been observed in at least 4 studies, that 85.3% of the population was hospitalized. Among 19 of the 20 studies, more severe forms of the disease were observed and in 14 of them, higher rates of complications among obese people infected with the new coronavirus. Limitation differences in the definition of obesity was observed among publications, of which obesity was considered from a body mass index >25 kg/m². CONCLUSIONS: In the current review, obesity and overweight were represented an unfavorable factor for infection of novel coronavirus, where the higher the BMI the worse the outcomes. This occurred by worsening the infection itself, as well as increasing the prevalence of hospitalizations, worst outcomes and greater lethality; especially when co-occurring with other chronic conditions and in the elderly as well. Given this evidence, greater attention is suggested to the obese and overweight population in the face of the current pandemic.","de Siqueira, João Vitor Vieira; Almeida, Lucas Garrido; Zica, Bruno Otávio; Brum, Ingred Batista; Barceló, Alberto; de Siqueira Galil, Arise Garcia",Obes Res Clin Pract,,672

The spread and lethality rates of the COVID-19 have ignited studies that focus on the development of therapeutics for either treatment or prophylaxis purposes. In parallel, drug repurposing studies have also come into prominence. Herein, we aimed at having a holistic understanding of conformational and dynamical changes induced by an experimentally characterized inhibitor on main protease (Mpro) which would enable the discovery of novel inhibitors. To this end, we performed molecular dynamics simulations using crystal structures of apo and &#945;-ketoamide 13b-bound Mpro homodimer. Analysis of trajectories pertaining to apo Mpro revealed a new target site, which is located at the homodimer interface, next to the catalytic dyad. Thereafter, we performed ensemble-based virtual screening by exploiting the ZINC and DrugBank databases and identified three candidate molecules, namely eluxadoline, diosmin, and ZINC02948810 that could invoke local and global conformational rearrangements which were also elicited by &#945;-ketoamide 13b on the catalytic dyad of Mpro. Furthermore, ZINC23881687 stably interacted with catalytically important residues Glu166 and Ser1 and the target site throughout the simulation. However, it gave positive binding energy, presumably, due to displaying higher flexibility that might dominate the entropic term, which is not included in the MM-PBSA method. Finally, ZINC20425029, whose mode of action was different, modulated dynamical properties of catalytically important residue, Ala285. As such, this study presents valuable findings that might be used in the development of novel therapeutics against Mpro.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

We synthesized the evidence regarding efficacy and safety (review 1), as well as risks of droplet dispersion, aerosol generation, and associated transmission (review 2) of viral products. SOURCE: Literature searches were performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Chinese databases, and medRxiv. Review 1: we synthesized results from randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HFNC to conventional oxygen therapy (COT) in critically ill patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Review 2: we narratively summarized findings from studies evaluating droplet dispersion, aerosol generation, or infection transmission associated with HFNC. For both reviews, paired reviewers independently conducted screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. We evaluated certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: No eligible studies included COVID-19 patients. Review 1: 12 RCTs (n = 1,989 patients) provided low-certainty evidence that HFNC may reduce invasive ventilation (relative risk [RR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 0.99) and escalation of oxygen therapy (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.98) in patients with respiratory failure. Results provided no support for differences in mortality (moderate certainty), or in-hospital or intensive care length of stay (moderate and low certainty, respectively). Review 2: four studies evaluating droplet dispersion and three evaluating aerosol generation and dispersion provided very low certainty evidence. Two simulation studies and a crossover study showed mixed findings regarding the effect of HFNC on droplet dispersion. Although two simulation studies reported no associated increase in aerosol dispersion, one reported that higher flow rates were associated with increased regions of aerosol density. CONCLUSIONS: High-flow nasal cannula may reduce the need for invasive ventilation and escalation of therapy compared with COT in COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. This benefit must be balanced against the unknown risk of airborne transmission.","Agarwal, Arnav; Basmaji, John; Muttalib, Fiona; Granton, David; Chaudhuri, Dipayan; Chetan, Devin; Hu, Malini; Fernando, Shannon M; Honarmand, Kimia; Bakaa, Layla; Brar, Sonia; Rochwerg, Bram; Adhikari, Neill K; Lamontagne, Francois; Murthy, Srinivas; Hui, David S C; Gomersall, Charles; Mubareka, Samira; Diaz, Janet V; Burns, Karen E A; Couban, Rachel; Ibrahim, Quazi; Guyatt, Gordon H; Vandvik, Per O",Can J Anaesth,,672

This also appears to hold for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Evidence from China and Europe has suggested that mortality from COVID-19 infection is higher in men than women, but evidence from US populations is lacking. Utilizing data from a large healthcare provider, we determined if males, as compared to females have a higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and if among the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, male sex is independently associated with COVID-19 severity and poor in-hospital outcomes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from a COVID-19 Surveillance and Outcomes Registry (CURATOR). Data were extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMR). A total of 96,473 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab specimens via Polymerized Chain Reaction (PCR) tests were included. For hospital-based analyses, all patients admitted during the same time-period were included. Of the 96,473 patients tested, 14,992 (15.6%) tested positive, of whom 4,785 (31.9%) were hospitalized and 452 (9.5%) died. Among all patients tested, men were significantly older. The overall SARS-CoV-2 positivity among all tested individuals was 15.5%, and was higher in males as compared to females 17.0% vs. 14.6% [OR 1.20]. This sex difference held after adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, marital status, insurance type, median income, BMI, smoking and 17 comorbidities included in Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) [aOR 1.39]. A higher proportion of males (vs. females) experienced pulmonary (ARDS, hypoxic respiratory failure) and extra-pulmonary (acute renal injury) complications during their hospital course. After adjustment, length of stay (LOS), need for mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality were significantly higher in males as compared to females. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of a large US cohort, males were more likely to test positive for COVID-19. In hospitalized patients, males were more likely to have complications, require ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, and had higher mortality than females, independent of age. Sex disparities in COVID-19 vulnerability are present, and emphasize the importance of examining sex-disaggregated data to improve our understanding of the biological processes involved to potentially tailor treatment and risk stratify patients.","Vahidy, Farhaan S; Pan, Alan P; Ahnstedt, Hilda; Munshi, Yashasvee; Choi, Huimahn A; Tiruneh, Yordanos; Nasir, Khurram; Kash, Bita A; Andrieni, Julia D; McCullough, Louise D",PLoS One,,672

Whereas anesthesiologists may be primarily concerned with airway and respiratory management, the COVID-19 data accumulated to date indicate that primary and/or secondary cardiovascular complications are common. Previous studies have demonstrated that the mortality rate is significantly higher in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) than in patients without CVD. Dysregulation of immune function in patients with CVD may be involved in the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Anesthesia and surgical procedures can modulate the immune system, and some patients undergoing surgery, particularly those undergoing cardiovascular procedures, have CVD. In perioperative management for patients with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 and those who have recovered from COVID-19, it is important for anesthesiologists to be concerned not only with airway and respiratory management, but also with cardiovascular complications and perioperative circulatory management to control the progression of the disease in patients with COVID-19.","Hirata, Naoyuki; Yamakage, Michiaki",J. anesth,,672

260058,Enfermedad covid-19. Reporte del primer caso confirmado en Córdoba (Argentina) y revisión de la literatura./ [Covid-19 disease. Report of the first confirmed case in Córdoba (Argentina) and literatura review],2020,"BACKGROUND: Daily new COVID-19 cases from January to April 2020 demonstrate varying patterns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across different geographical regions. Constant infection rates were observed in some countries, whereas China and South Korea had a very low number of daily new cases. In fact, China and South Korea successfully and quickly flattened their COVID-19 curve. To understand why this was the case, this paper investigated possible aerosol-forming patterns in the atmosphere and their relationship to the policy measures adopted by select countries. OBJECTIVE: The main research objective was to compare the outcomes of policies adopted by countries between January and April 2020. Policies included physical distancing measures that in some cases were associated with mask use and city disinfection. We investigated whether the type of social distancing framework adopted by some countries (ie, without mask use and city disinfection) led to the continual dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 (daily new cases) in the community during the study period. METHODS: We examined the policies used as a preventive framework for virus community transmission in some countries and compared them to the policies adopted by China and South Korea. Countries that used a policy of social distancing by 1-2 m were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of countries that implemented social distancing (1-2 m) only, and the second comprised China and South Korea, which implemented distancing with additional transmission/isolation measures using masks and city disinfection. Global daily case maps from Johns Hopkins University were used to provide time-series data for the analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that virus transmission was reduced due to policies affecting SARS-CoV-2 propagation over time. Remarkably, China and South Korea obtained substantially better results than other countries at the beginning of the epidemic due to their adoption of social distancing (1-2 m) with the additional use of masks and sanitization (city disinfection). These measures proved to be effective due to the atmosphere carrier potential of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that social distancing by 1-2 m with mask use and city disinfection yields positive outcomes. These strategies should be incorporated into prevention and control policies and be adopted both globally and by individuals as a method to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.","Telles, Charles Roberto; Roy, Archisman; Ajmal, Mohammad Rehan; Mustafa, Syed Khalid; Ahmad, Mohammad Ayaz; de la Serna, Juan Moises; Frigo, Elisandro Pires; Rosales, Manuel Hernández",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,672

The qualitative study aims to explore the lived experiences, beliefs, feelings, and challenges faced by Pakistani migrant physicians working in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An exploratory phenomenological approach was used to collate data on experiences expressed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Purposive and snowball sampling was used to target participants, which were doctors of Pakistani origin involved in the direct care and management of COVID-19 patients in different NHS hospitals of the United Kingdom. Semi-structured, in-depth telephonic interviews were conducted with study participants in May 2020. Data analysis was done parallel with data collection by using an inductive qualitative approach. RESULTS: We recruited ten frontline physicians. Four theme categories emerged from the data analysis: 1) Working across borders and cultures, 2) Role of beliefs for coping with stress and fear, 3) Passion and profession, and 4) Scaffolding the Pakistani health system. Overall, the results show that the participants received limited professional support, in terms of counseling and psychological rehabilitation. Instead, they had to use self-management strategies to cope with the situation. CONCLUSION: The intensive work exhausted participants physically and emotionally. They were holding a lot of grief and hurt inside, but still, healthcare professionals showed the spirit of professional dedication to overcome difficulties. Although currently coping with their emotional problems, comprehensive professional support should be made available to cater to the wellbeing of frontline physicians.","Saleem, Javeria; Ishaq, Muhammad; Zakar, Rubeena; Suddahazai, Imran Hussain Khan; Fischer, Florian",BMC Health Serv Res,,672

When designing these applications, is it better to offer: a) advice that if strictly adhered to is more likely to result in an individual successfully achieving their goal, even if fewer users will choose to adopt it? or b) advice that is likely to be adopted by a larger number of users, but which is sub-optimal with regard to any particular individual achieving their goal? We identify this dilemma, characterized as Goal-Directed vs. Adoption-Directed advice, and investigate the design questions it raises through an online experiment undertaken in four advice domains (financial investment, making healthier lifestyle choices, route planning, training for a 5k run), with three user types, and across two levels of uncertainty. We report findings that suggest a preference for advice favoring individual goal attainment over higher user adoption rates, albeit with significant variation across advice domains; and discuss their design implications.","Dove, Graham; Balestra, Martina; Mann, Devin; Nov, Oded",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.12147v1.pdf,672

Thymoquinone (TQ) is one of the most active ingredients in Nigella sativa seeds. It has a variety of beneficial properties including anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activities. Here, we investigated the possible protective effects of TQ against kidney damage in septic BALB/c mice. Eight-week-old male BALB/c mice were divided into four groups: control, TQ, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and TQ+CLP. CLP was performed after 2 weeks of TQ gavage. After 48 h, we measured the histopathological alterations in the kidney tissue and the serum levels of creatinine (CRE) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). We also evaluated pyroptosis (NLRP3, caspase-1), apoptosis (caspase-3, caspase-8), proinflammatory (TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß, and IL-6)-related protein and gene expression levels. Our results demonstrated that TQ inhibited CLP-induced increased serum CRE and BUN levels. It also significantly inhibited the high levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, caspase-3, caspase-8, TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß, and IL-6 induced by CLP. Furthermore, NF-&#954;B protein level was significantly decreased in the TQ+CLP group than in the CLP group. Together, our results indicate that TQ may be a potential therapeutic agent for sepsis-induced AKI.","Guo, Li-Peng; Liu, Si-Xu; Yang, Qin; Liu, Hong-Yang; Xu, Lu-Lu; Hao, Yu-Hua; Zhang, Xiao-Qing",Biomed Res Int,,672

Pro-inflammatory cytokines storm generated by Covid-19 infection hyper-activates inflammatory response in host body, resulting in elevated release of inflammatory biomarkers. Present article describes the characteristic profile of these inflammatory and related biomarkers in a total of 48 critically ill Covid-19 patients, (Male = 38, F = 10), with mildly ill to severe, critically ill status and thus grouped accordingly. Inflammatory Biomarkers, Ferritin, ProCalcitonin, CReactive Protein, coagulation marker-D-Dimer, chemical analytes, Protein, Albumin, BUN, Bilirubin, Creatinine, and enzymes, Lactate Dehydrogenase, gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidases, Alkaline phosphatase were routine analyzed by standard methods described earlier. D-dimer, Ferritin, CRP and Procalcitonin exhibited variable alterations (P&lt;0.05 to P&lt;0.001), more markedly in critically ill patients than in the mild and severe. Biochemical analytes and enzymatic parameters showed elevated levels (P&lt;0.05 to P&lt;0.01) mostly in critically ill category of patients when compared with mild or severe, except total protein and albumin, which remained non-significant. It is concluded that cytokine, chemokines and pro-inflammatory markers, which released in abnormally high concentrations in Covid-19 patients of variable syndrome intensity, are significant indicators of disease severity, progression and success of treatments. As the pharmacological options may vary with the different stages of the disease therefore identifying the correct stage of the disease may be very useful in selecting the best option.","Alam, J.

Treatment of these critically ill patients is becoming one of the major challenges we are facing. Frequently, more than 10 types of drugs are used simultaneously in the treatment of these critically ill patients, and the combination of many different drugs may easily lead to drug interactions and adverse reactions. Therefore, clinical pharmacist should participate in the optimization of drug treatment programs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case of a critically ill COVID-19 patient with respiratory failure and diabetes mellitus is used as an example of an analysis of the treatment plan, utilization of combined medications, and the delivery of pharmaceutical care. RESULTS: There were some drug use unreasonable phenomena, including the extended continuation of arbidol treatment, the use of broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, the use of drugs with unproven anti-coronavirus effects. CONCLUSION: Clinical pharmacists should participate in the optimization of drug treatment programs and provide pharmaceutical care for critically ill COVID-19 patients; this can promote the rational use of drugs.","Li, Xiang; Li, Yanli; Guo, Shuai; Liu, Wenjun",Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,,672
263059,Facts and myths regarding covid-19 in athletes,2020,"In the end of 2019 COVID-19 emerged as a new threat worldwide and this disease present impaired immune system, exacerbated production of inflammatory cytokines, and coagulation disturbs. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a therapeutic option due to its intrinsic properties to alleviate inflammatory responses, capable to promote the restoring of injured tissue. EVs contain heterogeneous cargo, including active microRNAs, small noncoding sequences involved in post-transcriptional gene repression or degradation and can attach in multiple targets. This study investigated whether the MSC-EVs miRNA cargo has the capacity to modulate the exacerbated cytokines, cell death and coagulation disturbs present in severe COVID-19. Through bioinformatics analysis, four datasets of miRNA, using different stem cell tissue sources (bone marrow, umbilical cord and adipose tissue), and one dataset of mRNA (bone marrow) were analyzed. 58 miRNAs overlap in the four miRNA datasets analyzed. Sequentially, those miRNAs present in at least two datasets, were analyzed using miRWalk for the 3'UTR binding target mRNA. The result predicted 258 miRNAs for exacerbated cytokines and chemokines, 266 miRNAs for cell death genes and 148 miRNAs for coagulation cascades. Some miRNAs may simultaneously attenuate inflammatory agents, inhibit cell death genes and key factors of coagulation cascade, consequently preventing tissue damage and coagulation disturbs. Therefore, the MSC-derived EVs due to their heterogeneous cargo are a potential multitarget approach able to improve the survival rates of severe COVID-19 patients.","Schultz, Iago Carvalho; Bertoni, Ana Paula Santin; Wink, Márcia Rosângela",,,672

This preliminary study aimed to understand the implications of school closures on SBHC operations. Survey data were collected from a convenience sample of representatives from 427 SBHCs, representing approximately one sixth of SBHCs nationwide. When schools closed in spring 2020, 77% of SBHCs closed temporarily, 5% closed permanently, and 12% remained physically open. Telehealth was a crucial strategy used to continue delivering essential services. The percentage reporting any telehealth service offering before and after school closures increased by over 200%. Yet they also reported challenges, including financial and policy restraints. Many SBHCs that closed temporarily did so because their host schools closed, suggesting that making arrangements to remain open if a similar situation to the COVID-19 pandemic should arise might be beneficial. SBHCs are a proven cost-effective model to deliver health care in resource-limited communities. These preliminary study results indicate that SBHCs maintained service delivery following school closures, though many faced challenges. Further research is needed to fully understand the pandemic's impacts on SBHC service provision and health access and outcomes.","Sullivan, Erin; Brey, Laura; Soleimanpour, Samira",Health Promot Pract,,672

Providing care during a public health crisis presents a complex web of uncertainties regarding cancer care, personal health, and COVID-19 risk. Identifying caregivers' uncertainty experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic can be a first step in learning where to direct resources or alter policies to ensure that they can not only perform their caregiver role but also cope in health-promoting ways. Using uncertainty management theory, this study explored how the pandemic has impacted adult child caregivers' experiences caring for a parent diagnosed with a blood cancer, as well as their experiences of uncertainty and uncertainty management. As part of a larger study on blood cancer caregivers' needs, a survey was administered from March 30 to June 1, 2020, to recruit caregivers through the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. A qualitative and quantitative content analysis was conducted on open-ended responses from 84 caregivers. Caregivers described changes illustrating the complexity of providing care during a pandemic: (a) increased fears and uncertainty-related distress, b) reduced in-person care opportunities, (c) increased isolation, and (d) enhanced family communication. Caregivers with parents diagnosed with acute blood cancers used significantly more uncertainty management strategies and had more sources of uncertainty than caregivers with parents living with chronic blood cancer types. Findings highlight the need for supportive services to help caregivers manage uncertainty and improve their capacity to provide care in an unpredictable global health crisis. Such support may reduce poor psychosocial outcomes.","Fisher, Carla L; Wright, Kevin B; Hampton, Chelsea N; Vasquez, Taylor S; Kastrinos, Amanda; Applebaum, Allison J; Sae-Hau, Maria; Weiss, Elisa S; Lincoln, Greg; Bylund, Carma L",Transl Behav Med,,672

Mechanisms remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to report the demographics, angiographic findings, and in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 ACS patients and compare these with pre-COVID-19 cohorts. METHODS: From March 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020, data from 55 international centers were entered into a prospective, COVID-ACS Registry. Patients were COVID-19 positive (or had a high index of clinical suspicion) and underwent invasive coronary angiography for suspected ACS. Outcomes were in-hospital major cardiovascular events (all-cause mortality, re-myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, unplanned revascularization, or stent thrombosis). Results were compared with national pre-COVID-19 databases (MINAP [Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project] 2019 and BCIS [British Cardiovascular Intervention Society] 2018 to 2019). RESULTS: In 144 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and 121 non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) patients, symptom-to-admission times were significantly prolonged (COVID-STEMI vs. BCIS: median 339.0 min vs. 173.0 min; p < 0.001; COVID NSTE-ACS vs. MINAP: 417.0 min vs. 295.0 min; p = 0.012). Mortality in COVID-ACS patients was significantly higher than BCIS/MINAP control subjects in both subgroups (COVID-STEMI: 22.9% vs. 5.7%; p < 0.001; COVID NSTE-ACS: 6.6% vs. 1.2%; p < 0.001), which remained following multivariate propensity analysis adjusting for comorbidities (STEMI subgroup odds ratio: 3.33 [95% confidence interval: 2.04 to 5.42]).

Here we investigated whether women with PCOS are at an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Design: Population-based closed cohort study between 31 January 2020 and 22 July 2020 in the setting of a UK primary care database (The Health Improvement Network, THIN). Methods: The main outcome was the incidence of COVID-19 coded as suspected or confirmed by the primary care provider. We used Cox proportional hazards regression model with stepwise inclusion of explanatory variables (age, BMI, impaired glucose regulation, androgen excess, anovulation, vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease) to provide unadjusted and adjusted hazard risks (HR) of COVID-19 infection among women with PCOS compared to women without PCOS. Results: We identified 21 292 women with a coded diagnosis of PCO/PCOS and randomly selected 78 310 aged and general practice matched control women. The crude COVID-19 incidence was 18.1 and 11.9 per 1000 person-years among women with and without PCOS, respectively. Age-adjusted Cox regression analysis suggested a 51% higher risk of COVID-19 among women with PCOS compared to women without PCOS (HR: 1.51 (95% CI: 1.27-1.80), P < 0.001). After adjusting for age and BMI, HR reduced to 1.36 (1.14-1.63)], P = 0.001. In the fully adjusted model, women with PCOS had a 28% increased risk of COVID-19 (aHR: 1.28 (1.05-1.56), P = 0.015). Conclusion: Women with PCOS are at an increased risk of COVID-19 infection and should be specifically encouraged to adhere to infection control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Significance statement: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have an increased risk of cardio-metabolic disease, which have been identified as a risk factor for COVID-19. To investigate whether the increased metabolic risk in PCOS translates into an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, we carried out a population-based closed cohort study in the UK during its first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (January to July 2020), including 21 292 women with PCOS and 78 310 controls matched for sex, age and general practice location. Results revealed a 52% increased risk of COVID-19 infection in women with PCOS, which remained increased at 28% above controls after adjustment for age, BMI, impaired glucose regulation and other explanatory variables.","Subramanian, Anuradhaa; Anand, Astha; Adderley, Nicola J; Okoth, Kelvin; Toulis, Konstantinos A; Gokhale, Krishna; Sainsbury, Christopher; O039,; Reilly, Michael W; Arlt, Wiebke; Nirantharakumar, Krishnarajah",Eur J Endocrinol,,672

Due to the extensiveness of spread and death, it has been declared as a pandemic. This review focused on the current pandemic situation and understanding the prevention and control strategies of COVID-19. Data presented here was by April 3, 2020. A total of 1,016,399 cases of COVID-19 with 53,238 deaths was reported from 204 countries and territories including two international conveyances over the world. After China, most of the new cases were from Europe, particularly Italy acting as the source of importation to many of the other countries around the world. China has obtained success by ascribing control strategies against COVID-19. The implementation of China's strategy, as well as the development of a vaccine, may control the pandemic of COVID-19. Further robust studies are required for a clear understanding of transmission parameters, prevention, and control strategies of SARSCoV-2.

However, cobalamin can be synthesized only by few microorganisms so most bacteria need to take it up from the environment through the TonB-dependent transport system. The first stage of cobalamin import to E. coli cells occurs through the outer-membrane receptor called BtuB. Vitamin B12 binds with high affinity to the extracellular side of the BtuB protein. BtuB forms a ß-barrel with inner luminal domain and extracellular loops. To mechanically allow for cobalamin passage, the luminal domain needs to partially unfold with the help of the inner-membrane TonB protein. However, the mechanism of cobalamin permeation is unknown. Using all-atom molecular dynamics, we simulated the transport of cobalamin through the BtuB receptor embedded in an asymmetric and heterogeneous E. coli outer membrane. To enhance conformational sampling of the BtuB loops, we developed the Gaussian force-simulated annealing method (GF-SA) and coupled it with umbrella sampling. We found that cobalamin needs to rotate in order to permeate through BtuB. We showed that the mobility of BtuB extracellular loops is crucial for cobalamin binding and transport and resembles an induced fit mechanism. Loop mobility depends not only on the position of cobalamin but also on the extension of luminal domain. We provided atomistic details of cobalamin transport through the BtuB receptor showing the essential role of the mobility of BtuB extracellular loops. A similar TonB-dependent transport system is used also by many other compounds, such as haem and siderophores, and importantly, can be hijacked by natural antibiotics. Our work could have implications for future delivery of antibiotics to bacteria using this transport system.","Pienko, Tomasz; Trylska, Joanna",PLoS Comput Biol,,672
280964,[Home care amid and beyond COVID-19]./ Atención domiciliaria durante y después de la COVID-19,2021,"To mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, it is key to slow down the spreading of the life-threatening coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). This spreading mainly occurs through virus-laden droplets expelled at speaking, coughing, sneezing, or even breathing. To reduce infections through such respiratory droplets, authorities all over the world have introduced the so-called""2-meter distance rule""or""6-foot rule"". However, there is increasing empirical evidence, e.g. through the analysis of super-spreading events, that airborne transmission of the coronavirus over much larger distances plays a major role with tremendous implications for the risk assessment of coronavirus transmission. Here we employ direct numerical simulations of a typical respiratory aerosol in a turbulent jet of the respiratory event within a Lagrangian-Eulerian approach with 5000 droplets, coupled to the ambient velocity, temperature, and humidity fields to allow for exchange of mass and heat and to realistically account for the droplet evaporation under different ambient conditions. We found that for an ambient relative humidity RH of 50% the lifetime of the smallest droplets of our study with initial diameter of 10 um gets extended by a factor of more than 30 as compared to what is suggested by the classical picture of Wells, due to collective effects during droplet evaporation and the role of the respiratory humidity, while the larger droplets basically behave ballistically. With increasing ambient RH the extension of the lifetimes of the small droplets further increases and goes up to 150 times for 90% RH, implying more than two meters advection range of the respiratory droplets within one second. Smaller droplets live even longer and travel further. Our results may explain why COVID-19 superspreading events can occur for large ambient RH such as in cooled-down meat-processing plants or in pubs with poor ventilation.","Chong, Kai Leong; Ng, Chong Shen; Hori, Naoki; Yang, Rui; Verzicco, Roberto; Lohse, Detlef",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01841v1.pdf,672

The objective of this study was to examine the global association between lifestyle related factors and COVID-19 mortality using data from each individual country. MethodsThe association between prevalence of seven lifestyle related factors (overweight, insufficient physical activity, smoking, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and age over 65) and COVID-19 mortality was assessed by linear and multivariable regression among 186 countries. The cumulative effect of lifestyle related factors on COVID-19 mortality was assessed by dividing countries into four categories according to the number of lifestyle related factors in the upper half range and comparing the mean mortality between groups. ResultsIn linear regression, COVID-19 mortality was significantly associated with overweight, insufficient physical activity, hyperlipidemia, and age [≥]65. In multivariable regression, overweight and age [≥]65 demonstrated significant association with COVID-19 mortality (P = 0.0039, 0.0094). Countries with more risk factors demonstrated greater COVID-19 mortality (P for trend <0.001). ConclusionLifestyle related factors, especially overweight and elderly population, were associated with increased COVID-19 mortality on a global scale. Global effort to reduce burden of lifestyle related factors along with protection and vaccination of these susceptible groups may help reduce COVID-19 mortality.","Wang, Jingzhou; Sato, Toshiro; Sakuraba, Atsushi NA",,,672

285377,Covid-19: Nightingale hospitals set to shut down after seeing few patients,2020,"Infectious disease outbreaks recapitulate biology: they emerge from the multi-level interaction of hosts, pathogens, and their shared environment. As a result, predicting when, where, and how far diseases will spread requires a complex systems approach to modeling. Recent studies have demonstrated that predicting different components of outbreaks--e.g., the expected number of cases, pace and tempo of cases needing treatment, importation probability etc.--is feasible. Therefore, advancing both the science and practice of disease forecasting now requires testing for the presence of fundamental limits to outbreak prediction. To investigate the question of outbreak prediction, we study the information theoretic limits to forecasting across a broad set of infectious diseases using permutation entropy as a model independent measure of predictability. Studying the predictability of a diverse collection of historical outbreaks--including, gonorrhea, influenza, Zika, measles, polio, whooping cough, and mumps--we identify a fundamental entropy barrier for time series forecasting. However, we find that for most diseases this barrier to prediction is often well beyond the time scale of single outbreaks, implying prediction is likely to succeed. We also find that the forecast horizon varies by disease and demonstrate that both shifting model structures and social network heterogeneity are the most likely mechanisms for the observed differences in predictability across contagions. Our results highlight the importance of moving beyond time series forecasting, by embracing dynamic modeling approaches to prediction and suggest challenges for performing model selection across long disease time series. We further anticipate that our findings will contribute to the rapidly growing field of epidemiological forecasting and may relate more broadly to the predictability of complex adaptive systems.","Scarpino, Samuel V.; Petri, Giovanni",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07317v4.pdf,672

This narrative takes sociomaterial arrangements for granted and conceptualizes technology affordance - the problem-solving capability of a technology - as a standard built-in feature that automatically activates during technology deployment, leading to undiversified and predetermined collective benefits. This paper demonstrates that not everything is as it seems;implementing a technology is a necessary but insufficient condition for triggering its potential problem-solving capability. The potential affordance and effects of a technology are mediated by the sociomaterial arrangements that users assemble to connect their goals to the materiality of technological artifacts and socio-organizational context in which technology deployment takes place. To substantiate this argument and illustrate the mediating role of sociomaterial arrangements, we build on sociomateriality and technology affordance theory, and we present the results of a systematic review of Covid-19 literature in which 2187 documents are examined. The review combines text data mining, co-occurrence pattern recognition, and inductive coding, and it focuses on four digital technologies that public authorities have deployed as virus containment measures: infrared temperature-sensing devices;ICT-based surveillance and contact-tracing systems;bioinformatic tools and applications for laboratory testing;and electronic mass communications media. Reporting on our findings, we add nuances to the academic debate on sociomateriality, technology affordance, and the governance of technology in public health crises. In addition, we provide public authorities with practical recommendations on how to strengthen their approach to digital technology deployment for pandemic control.","Mora, Luca Kummitha Rama Krishna Reddy Esposito Giovanni",Government Information Quarterly,,672

We improve this approach in three important aspects. Firstly, we replace the standard finite differences discretisation by a finite element method with triangle elements. This does not only speed up inpainting and data selection, but even improves the reconstruction quality. Secondly, we propose highly efficient algorithms for spatial and tonal data optimisation that are several orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods. Last but not least, we show that our algorithms also allow working with very large images.

As the geriatric population continues to grow in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, it is essential to explore the influence of this outbreak on geriatric mental health, a topic often neglected. In this review, we depict the status of geriatric psychiatry in the Arab countries of the MENA region, exploring the variations from one nation to another. While some have a null exposure to the field, resources and expertise in other countries range from very limited to extensive. Furthermore, we highlight the measures implemented in the Arab region to address mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak; these tend to be insufficient when targeting the geriatric population. Finally, we provide short- and long-term recommendations to stakeholders that aim at enhancing the mental healthcare of older adults in the Arab countries of the MENA region, particularly during this pandemic.","El Hayek, Samer; Cheaito, Mohamad Ali; Nofal, Marwa; Abdelrahman, Doaa; Adra, Ali; Al Shamli, Siham; AlHarthi, Mansour; AlNuaimi, Nawaf; Aroui, Chaimaa; Bensid, Lynda; Emberish, Alkhansa Mahdi; Larnaout, Amine; Radwan, Ahmed; Slaih, Mohammad; Al Sinawi, Hamed",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,,672

291374,Evitemos la inseguridad alimentaria en tiempos de COVID-19 en Chile/ Let's avoid food insecurity in COVID-19 time in Chile,2020,"Selfie-based biometrics has great potential for a wide range of applications from marketing to higher security environments like online banking. This is now especially relevant since e.g. periocular verification is contactless, and thereby safe to use in pandemics such as COVID-19. However, selfie-based biometrics faces some challenges since there is limited control over the data acquisition conditions. Therefore, super-resolution has to be used to increase the quality of the captured images. Most of the state of the art super-resolution methods use deep networks with large filters, thereby needing to train and store a correspondingly large number of parameters, and making their use difficult for mobile devices commonly used for selfie-based. In order to achieve an efficient super-resolution method, we propose an Efficient Single Image Super-Resolution (ESISR) algorithm, which takes into account a trade-off between the efficiency of the deep neural network and the size of its filters. To that end, the method implements a novel loss function based on the Sharpness metric. This metric turns out to be more suitable for increasing the quality of the eye images. Our method drastically reduces the number of parameters when compared with Deep CNNs with Skip Connection and Network (DCSCN): from 2,170,142 to 28,654 parameters when the image size is increased by a factor of x3. Furthermore, the proposed method keeps the sharp quality of the images, which is highly relevant for biometric recognition purposes. The results on remote verification systems with raw images reached an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 8.7% for FaceNet and 10.05% for VGGFace. Where embedding vectors were used from periocular images the best results reached an EER of 8.9% (x3) for FaceNet and 9.90% (x4) for VGGFace.","Tapia, Juan; Gomez-Barrero, Marta; Lara, Rodrigo; Valenzuela, Andres; Busch, Christoph",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08449v1.pdf,672

Here, we investigated the clinical course and management of hospitalized moderate SARS-CoV-2 patients. The medical records and follow-up data were analyzed from the SARS-CoV-2 patients outside Wuhan. A total of 73 moderate patients (38 men, 35 women) were included, with median age of 47.0 (38.5-57.5) years. Among them, only one patient (1.4%) died using active treatment to improve symptoms. The median duration of the four main symptoms cough, fever, chest tightness, and fatigue were 11.0, 8.0, 11.0, and 7.0 days, respectively; the median duration of the positive nucleic acid test (NAT) results for SARS-CoV-2 was 16.5 days; the median hospitalization time was 25.0 days in 72 moderate survivors. The duration of cough and fever was positively correlated with the duration of the positive NAT results. On admission, 50% had lymphopenia; less than 30% had abnormal blood biochemistry findings involving hyperglycemia, liver function and myocardial enzymes. At discharge, the laboratory indexes were substantially improved. Two weeks after discharge, 5.6% survivors experienced a recurrence of the positive NAT results. Moderate SARS-CoV-2 patients have a good prognosis by the active treatment. A small proportion of the recovered moderate patients still may be virus carriers and require an additional round of viral detection.","Peng, Xiaojuan; Liu, Qi; Chen, Zhaolin; Wen, Guiyan; Li, Qing; Chen, Yanfang; Xiong, Jie; Meng, Xinzhou; Ding, Yuanjin; Shi, Ying; Tang, Shaohui",PLoS One,,672

METHODS: A multidisciplinary task force was convened by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) to provide guidance on the management of MIS-C associated with SARS-CoV-2 and hyperinflammation in COVID-19. The task force was composed of 9 pediatric rheumatologists, 2 adult rheumatologists, 2 pediatric cardiologists, 2 pediatric infectious disease specialists, and 1 pediatric critical care physician. Preliminary statements addressing clinical questions related to MIS-C and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 were developed based on evidence reports. Consensus was built through a modified Delphi process that involved 2 rounds of anonymous voting and 2 webinars. A 9-point scale was used to determine the appropriateness of each statement (median scores of 1-3 for inappropriate, 4-6 for uncertain, and 7-9 for appropriate), and consensus was rated as low, moderate, or high based on dispersion of the votes along the numeric scale. Approved guidance statements were those that were classified as appropriate with moderate or high levels of consensus, as prespecified prior to voting. RESULTS: The ACR task force approved a total of 128 guidance statements addressing the management of MIS-C and hyperinflammation in pediatric COVID-19. These statements were refined into 40 final clinical guidance statements, accompanied by a flow diagram depicting the diagnostic pathway for MIS-C.

Lymphopenia occurs early in the clinical course and is a predictor of disease severity and outcomes. The mechanism of lymphopenia in COVID-19 is uncertain. It has been variously attributed to the release of inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF-&#945;; direct infection of the lymphocytes by the virus; and rapid sequestration of lymphocytes in the tissues. Additionally, we postulate that prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is a key meditator of lymphopenia in COVID-19. First, SARS-CoV infection is known to stimulate the production of PGD2 in the airways, which inhibits the host dendritic cell response via the DP1 receptor signaling. Second, PGD2 is known to upregulate monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) via the DP2 receptor signaling in group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2). We propose targeting PGD2/DP2 signaling using a receptor antagonist such as ramatroban as an immunotherapy for immune dysfunction and lymphopenia in COVID-19 disease.","Gupta, Ajay; Chander Chiang, Kate",Med Hypotheses,,672

Coronaviruses mainly cause respiratory and digestive tract diseases, several coronaviruses are responsible for porcine diarrhea, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and emerging swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). Those viruses have caused huge economic losses and are considered as potential public health threats. Porcine torovirus (PToV) and coronaviruses, sharing similar genomic structure and replication strategy, belong to the same order Nidovirales. Here, we developed a multiplex TaqMan-probe-based real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of PEDV, PDCoV, PToV, and SADS-CoV for the first time. Specific primers and TaqMan fluorescent probes were designed targeting the ORF1a region of PDEV, PToV, and SADS-CoV and the ORF1b region of PDCoV. The method showed high sensitivity and specificity, with a detection limit of 1 × 102 copies/µL for each pathogen. A total of 101 clinical swine samples with signs of diarrhea were analyzed using this method, and the result showed good consistency with conventional reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). This method improves the efficiency for surveillance of these emerging and reemerging swine enteric viruses and can help reduce economic losses to the pig industry, which also benefits animal and public health.","Pan, Zhongzhou; Lu, Jiaxuan; Wang, Ningning; He, Wan-Ting; Zhang, Letian; Zhao, Wen; Su, Shuo",Virulence,,672

Due to absence of specific vaccine or therapy, non-pharmacological interventions including social distancing, contact tracing are essential to end the worldwide COVID-19. We propose a mathematical model that predicts the dynamics of COVID-19 in 17 provinces of India and the overall India. A complete scenario is given to demonstrate the estimated pandemic life cycle along with the real data or history to date, which in turn divulges the predicted inflection point and ending phase of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed model monitors the dynamics of six compartments, namely susceptible (S), asymptomatic (A), recovered (R), infected (I), isolated infected (I q) and quarantined susceptible (S q), collectively expressed SARII qS q. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the robustness of model predictions to parameter values and the sensitive parameters are estimated from the real data on the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Our results reveal that achieving a reduction in the contact rate between uninfected and infected individuals by quarantined the susceptible individuals, can effectively reduce the basic reproduction number. Our model simulations demonstrate that the elimination of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is possible by combining the restrictive social distancing and contact tracing. Our predictions are based on real data with reasonable assumptions, whereas the accurate course of epidemic heavily depends on how and when quarantine, isolation and precautionary measures are enforced.","Sarkar, Kankan; Khajanchi, Subhas; Nieto, Juan J.",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,672

A third serosurvey was conducted between December 2020 and January 2021 to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the general population and healthcare workers (HCWs) in India. METHODS: The third serosurvey was conducted in the same 70 districts as the first and second serosurveys. For each district, at least 400 individuals aged &#8805;10 years from the general population and 100 HCWs from subdistrict-level health facilities were enrolled. Serum samples from the general population were tested for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S1-RBD) proteins of SARS-CoV-2, whereas serum samples from HCWs were tested for anti-S1-RBD. Weighted seroprevalence adjusted for assay characteristics was estimated. RESULTS: Of the 28,598 serum samples from the general population, 4585 (16%) had IgG antibodies against the N protein, 6647 (23.2%) had IgG antibodies against the S1-RBD protein, and 7436 (26%) had IgG antibodies against either the N protein or the S1-RBD protein. Weighted and assay-characteristic-adjusted seroprevalence against either of the antibodies was 24.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 23.0-25.3%].

This multinational study assessed whether demand for SARS-CoV-2 tests could also be predicted by Google searches for key COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS: The weekly number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed in Italy and the United States was retrieved from official sources. A concomitant electronic search was performed in Google Trends, using terms for key COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: The model that provided the highest coefficient of determination for the United States (R2 = 82.8%) included a combination of searching for cough (with a time lag of 2 weeks), fever (with a time lag of 2 weeks), and headache (with a time lag of 3 weeks; the time lag refers to the amount of time between when a search was conducted and when a test was administered). In Italy, headache provided the model with the highest adjusted R2 (86.8%), with time lags of both 1 and 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: Weekly monitoring of Google Trends scores for nonspecific COVID-19 symptoms is a reliable approach for anticipating SARS-CoV-2 testing demands ~2 weeks in the future.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Mattiuzzi, Camilla; Santos de Oliveira, Maria Helena; Henry, Brandon M",Lab Med,,672

A few months after the assay was released to our patients, some materials, reagents, and equipment became in short supply. Alternative protocols were necessary in order to avoid stopping testing to the population. However, the suitability of these alternatives needs to be validated before their use. Here, we investigated if saliva is a reliable alternative specimen to nasopharyngeal swabs; if 0.45% saline is a reliable alternative to guanidine hydrochloride as a collection viral transport media; the stability of SARS-COV-2 in guanidine hydrochloride and in 0.45% saline for 10 and 50 days at room temperature; and if the primers/probe concentration and thermocycling times could be reduced so as to overcome the short supply of these reagents and equipment, without a significant loss of the assay performance. We found that saliva is not an appropriated specimen for our method-nasopharyngeal swabs perform better. Saline (0.45%) and guanidine hydrochloride have a similar SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic capability as tube additives. Reliable SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection can be performed after sample storage for 10 days at room temperature (18-23 °C) in both 0.45% saline and guanidine hydrochloride. Using synthetic RNA, and decreasing the concentration of primers by five-fold and probes by 2.5-fold, changed the assay limit of detection (LOD) from 7.2 copies/reaction to 23.7 copies/reaction and the subsequent reducing of thermocycling times changed the assay LOD from 23.7 copies/reaction to 44.2 copies/reaction. However, using real clinical samples with Cq values ranging from ~12.15 to ~36.46, the results of the three tested conditions were almost identical. These alterations will not affect the vast majority of diagnostics and increase the daily testing capability in 30% and increase primers and probe stocks in 500% and 250%, respectively. Taken together, the alternative protocols described here overcome the short supply of tubes, reagents and equipment during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, avoiding the collapse of test offering for the population: 105,757 samples were processed, and 25,156 SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics were performed from 9 May 2020 to 30 June 2020.","Barra, Gustavo Barcelos; Santa Rita, Ticiane Henriques; Mesquita, Pedro Góes; Jácomo, Rafael Henriques; Nery, Lídia Freire Abdalla",,,672

Methods: This is an ecological study, whose units of analysis were the 26 state capitals and the Federal District of Brazil. Prevalence was estimated by the results of the Vigilância de Fatores de Risco e Proteção para Doenças Crônicas por Inquérito Telefônico 2019 (VIGITEL). The general mortality rates due to COVID-19 were collected on the official website of the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MH) and stratified by the same Brazilian capitals evaluated in the VIGITEL survey. The rates included the period between the 1st and 29th Epidemiological Weeks of 2020. The Partial Correlation Test (r) was used, controlled for confounding factors, to evaluate the correlation between the prevalence of overweight/obesity and the overall mortality rates due to COVID-19. Results: The mean mortality rate for COVID-19 in the period was 65.1 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. Regarding the prevalence of obesity and overweight, 20.2% and 54.7% were the mean values observed in the state capitals, respectively. The prevalence of obesity was positively correlated with the overall mortality rate due to COVID-19, with mean positive correlation (r=0.380) and statistically significant correlation (p=0.034). Conclusion: This study pointed out that, at the aggregate level, there is a concomitant and correlated increase in mortality rates due to COVID-19 and prevalence of obesity in Brazilian capitals.

Liver impairment has been reported in up to 54% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19 on a preexisting chronic liver disease is an actively studied area of research. The contribution of our study is towards determining the predictors of severity and the outcome of liver injury among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection, including patients with a preexisting liver disease and COVID-19. METHODS: This single center retrospective cohort study included all patients &#8805;18 years, admitted in Sheba Medical Center with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were obtained using the MDClone platform and rechecked after data decryption using electronic health records. RESULTS: Of 382 patients with COVID-19, 66.4% had increased liver biochemistry. Mild increase was observed in 76.7%. The higher level of fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) at admission was independently associated with higher mortality rate. Preexisting liver disease was detected in 15.4% patients. Most common etiology was nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (78.7%). The mortality of hospitalized patients with preexisting liver disease was 16.7% compared to 6.8% in patients without preexisting liver disease (RR = 2.792, P = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, liver disease adjusted to age and BMI was associated with mortality with high statistical significance.

To identify the resources and costs needed to implement school-based mitigation strategies and provide schools and jurisdictions with information to aid resource allocation, a microcosting methodology was employed to estimate costs in three categories: materials and consumables, additional custodial staff members, and potential additional transportation. National average estimates, using the national pre-kindergarten through grade 12 (preK-12) public enrollment of 50,685,567 students, range between a mean of $55 (materials and consumables only) to $442 (all three categories) per student. State-by-state estimates of additional funds needed as a percentage of fiscal year 2018 student expenditures (2) range from an additional 0.3% (materials and consumables only) to 7.1% (all three categories); however, only seven states had a maximum estimate above 4.2%. These estimates, although not exhaustive, highlight the level of resources needed to ensure that schools reopen and remain open in the safest possible manner and offer administrators at schools and school districts and other decision-makers the cost information necessary to budget and prioritize school resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rice, Ketra L; Miller, Gabrielle F; Coronado, Fátima; Meltzer, Martin I",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,672

Untreated OSA is associated with increased mortality and difficulties in social functioning. A delay in initiating treatment may therefore have harmful consequences. Between February and April 2020, the so-called first wave of the pandemic, the overall activity of sleep centers in Europe was reduced by 80%. As the international infection control authorities released guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 outbreak control, many of the national sleep societies provided strategies for a gradual re-opening of sleep facilities. Most of these strategies were not evidences-based and, in a climate of general concern, worldwide it was strongly advised to post-pone any non-urgent sleep-related procedure. Despite the initial idea that the outbreak could be transient, after one year it is still ongoing and the price we are paying, not only includes deaths caused by COVID-19, but also deaths caused by missed or late diagnosis. As further delays in diagnosing and treating patients with sleep apnea are no more acceptable, a new arrangement of sleep facilities and resources, in order to operate safely and effectively, is now mandatory. In this article, we review most recent literature and guidelines in order to provide practical advice for a new arrangement of sleep laboratories and the care of patients with obstructive sleep apnea after one year from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Spicuzza, Lucia; Sanna, Antonio",Sleep Med,,672
309358,La farmacotecnia hospitalaria frente a la COVID-19./ Hospital Pharmacy Compounding against COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"PURPOSE: To evaluate stress levels among the health care workers (HCWs) of the radiation oncology community in Asian countries. METHODS: HCWs of the radiation oncology departments from 29 tertiary cancer care centers of Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and Nepal were studied from May 2020 to July 2020. A total of 758 eligible HCWs were identified. The 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder, 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire, and 22-Item Impact of Events Scale-Revised were used for assessing anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Univariate and multivariate analysis was done to identify the causative factors affecting mental health. RESULTS: A total of 758 participants from 794 HCWs were analyzed. The median age was 31 years (IQR, 27-28). The incidence of moderate to severe levels of anxiety, depression, and stress was 34.8%, 31.2%, and 18.2%, respectively. Severe personal concerns were noticed by 60.9% of the staff. On multivariate analysis, the presence of commonly reported symptoms of COVID-19 during the previous 2 weeks, contact history (harzard ratio [HR], 2.04; CI, 1.15 to 3.63), and compliance with precautionary measures (HR, 1.69; CI, 1.19 to 2.45) for COVID-19 significantly predicted for increasing anxiety (HR, 2.67; CI, 1.93 to 3.70), depression (HR, 3.38; CI 2.36 to 4.84), and stress (HR, 2.89; CI, 1.88 to 4.43) (P < .001). A significant regional variation was also noticed for anxiety, stress, and personal concerns. CONCLUSION: This survey conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that a significant proportion of HCWs in the radiation oncology community experiences moderate to severe levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. This trend is alarming and it is important to identify and intervene at the right time to improve the mental health of HCWs to avoid any long-term impacts.","Wadasadawala, Tabassum; Kumar, Anuj; Laskar, Sarbani Ghosh; Gondhowiardjo, Soehartati; Mokal, Smruti; Goswami, Savita; Giselvania, Angela; Kapoor, Rakesh; Das, Abhijit; Pradhan, Satyajit; Pujari, Lincoln; Acharya, Bibek; Chapagain, Sandhya; Mahantshetty, Umesh; Vadgaonkar, Rohit; Hussain, Qazi Mushtaq; Akbarov, Kamal; Agarwal, Jai Prakash",JCO Glob Oncol,,672

Demand for health care expenditure increased after the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is interesting in modeling the nexus between public and private health expenditure, carbon dioxide emissions, and economic growth. To this end, the present study analyzed the nexus between public and private health care expenditure, economic growth, and environmental pollution for 36 Asian countries for the period 1991-2017. FMOLS, GMM, and quantile regression analysis confirm the EKC hypothesis in Asia. Besides, FMOLS and quantile regressions reached the reducing effects of government and private health expenditures on CO2 emissions. While quantile regression results show that public and private health expenditures can mitigate CO2 emissions; however, these results differ for various levels of CO2. Findings of quantile regression show a significant impact of both public and private health expenditures in reducing CO2 at the 50th and 75th quantiles but results are insignificant for the 25th quantile. Overall, the paper concludes that both government and private health sectors' expenditures caused CO2 emissions to decrease in Asia and that the negative impact of the private health sector on CO2 emissions is greater than that of the government health sector. The concluding remark is that the higher the health spending, the higher the environmental quality will be in Asia. Hence, the health administrators need to increase public and private health expenditures with an effective cost-service and energy-efficient management approach to reach sustainable health services and a sustainable environment in Asia.","Bilgili, Faik; Kuskaya, Sevda; Khan, Masreka; Awan, Ashar; Türker, Oguzhan",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

South Africa, like many other countries, initiated a multifaceted national response to the pandemic. Self-isolation and quarantine are essential components of the public health response in the country. This paper examined perceptions and preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine during the initial phase of the pandemic in South Africa. METHODS: The analysis used data obtained from an online quantitative survey conducted in all nine provinces using a data-free platform. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Of 55,823 respondents, 40.1% reported that they may end up in self-isolation or quarantine, 32.6% did not think that they would and 27.4% were unsure. Preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine was 59.0% for self, 53.8% for child and 59.9% for elderly. The odds of perceived possibility for self-isolation or quarantine were significantly higher among Coloureds, Whites, and Indians/Asians than Black Africans, and among those with moderate or high self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 than those with low risk perception. The odds were significantly lower among older age groups than those aged 18-29 years, and those unemployed than fully employed. The odds of preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine were significantly less likely among females than males. Preparedness for self, child and elderly isolation or quarantine was significantly more likely among other population groups than Black Africans and among older age groups than those aged 18-29 years. Preparedness for self, child and elderly isolation or quarantine was significantly less likely among those self-employed than fully employed and those residing in informal dwellings than formal dwellings. In addition, preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine was significantly less likely among those with moderate and high self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 than low risk perception. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the challenge of implementing self-isolation or quarantine in a country with different and unique social contexts. There is a need for public awareness regarding the importance of self-isolation or quarantine as well as counter measures against contextual factors inhibiting this intervention, especially in impoverished communities.","Sifunda, Sibusiso; Mokhele, Tholang; Manyaapelo, Thabang; Dukhi, Natisha; Sewpaul, Ronel; Parker, Whadi-Ah; Parker, Saahier; Naidoo, Inbarani; Jooste, Sean; Ramlagan, Shandir; Gaida, Razia; Mabaso, Musawenkosi; Zuma, Khangelani; Reddy, Priscilla",BMC Public Health,,672
311029,Quelle conduite à tenir pour prendre en charge des pathologies médicales de la surface oculaire pendant l'épidémie de COVID-19 ?/ [How to approach management of ocular surface disease during COVID-19 pandemic?],2020,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between the increases in pulse pressure (PP) and arterial stiffness determined by aging or systemic hypertension has been widely reported. These findings are supported by large-cohort analysis conducted in well-known populations, such as the Framingham Study. However, there is evidence that an age-PP curvilinear relationship may exist in hypertensive subjects. This study aimed to evaluate the age-related change in pulse pressure and arterial stiffness in a population-based study. METHODS: Carotid femoral Pulse Wave Velocity (cfPWV) were obtained in 2075 subjects. RESULTS: Age-related changes of PP showed a curvilinear relationship (R=0.39, p<0.0001) in normotensive subjects, with a nadir at around 50 years of age. On the other hand, the age-cfPWV relationship showed a linear and positive correlation (R=0.72, p<0.0001). PP also showed a curvilinear relationship with age (R=0.36, p<0.0001) in hypertensive subjects, with a nadir around 50 years of age. The age-cfPWV relationship showed a linear and positive correlation (R=0.55, p<0.0001). Similar results were observed in the adult population (age&#8805;16 years). Multivariate analysis showed that age, sex, cfPWV, and mean arterial pressure are determinants of PP values in the entire population; however, this result is not uniform when the different subgroups are analyse. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, age-related changes in PP showed a curvilinear relationship and no parallelism with the age-cfPWV relationship for both normotensive and hypertensive subjects. The determinants of PP impact it differently depending on age and the pathological condition of the subject.","Díaz, Alejandro; Pascaner, Ariel; Wray, Sandra; Fischer, Edmundo Cabrera",Current hypertension reviews (Online),,672
312064,Precedent for the Present: Neurosurgery During the 1918 War-Time Influenza Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: On the 19th of January, 2020, the Chief Medical Officer of Australia issued a statement about a novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2. Since this date, there have been variable jurisdictional responses, including lockdowns, and restrictions on podiatry practice. This study aimed to describe impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the podiatry profession in Australia. METHODS: This was a cross sectional study of Australian podiatrists using demographic data collected between 2017 and 2020, and pandemic-related question responses collected between 30th March and 31st August, 2020. Data were collected online and participants described their work settings, patient funding types, business decisions and impacts, and information sources used to guide practice decisions during this time-period. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyse open-ended questions about their practice impact of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: There were 732 survey responses, with 465 Australian podiatrists or podiatric surgeons providing responses describing pandemic impact. From these responses, 223 (49% of 453) podiatrists reported no supply issues, or having adequate supplies for the foreseeable future with personal protective equipment (PPE) or consumables to support effective infection prevention and control. The most frequent responses about employment, or hours of work, impact were reported in the various categories of ""business as usual"" (n = 312, 67%). Participants described most frequently using the local state and territory Department of Health websites (n = 347, 75%), and the Australian Podiatry Association (n = 334, 72%) to make decisions about their business. Overarching themes which resounded through open-ended comments was that working through the pandemic was likened to a marathon, and not a sprint. Themes were: (i) commitment to do this, (ii) it's all in the plan, but not everything goes to plan, (iii) my support team must be part of getting through it, (iv) road blocks happen, and (v) nothing is easy, what's next? CONCLUSION: Podiatrists in Australia reported variable pandemic impact on their business decisions, PPE stores, and their valued sources of information. Podiatrists also described their ""marathon"" journey through the pandemic to date, with quotes describing their challenges and highlights. Describing these experiences should provide key learnings for future workforce challenges, should further restrictions come into place.","Williams, Cylie M; Couch, Anna; Haines, Terry; Menz, Hylton B",J Foot Ankle Res,,672

Recent studies have detected in them depression and anxiety symptoms and burnout syndrome, with personal and social conditions impacting their response capacity during the health emergency. Our aim was to generate recommendations for the promotion and protection of the mental health of health workers and teams in the first line of care in the health emergency due to COVID-19. METHODS: A rapid literature search was carried out in PubMed and Google Scholar, and an iterative expert consensus and through electronic consultation, with 13 participants from the areas of psychology, psychiatry and medicine; the grading of its strength and directionality was carried out according to the international standards of the Joanna Briggs Institute. RESULTS: Thirty-one recommendations were generated on self-care of health workers, community care among health teams, screening for alarm signs in mental health and for health institutions. CONCLUSIONS: The promotion and protection activities in mental health to face the health emergency generated by COVID-19 worldwide can include coordinated actions between workers, health teams and health institutions as part of a comprehensive, community care, co-responsible and sustained over time.","Cantor-Cruz, Francy; McDouall-Lombana, Jorge; Parra, Aldemar; Martin-Benito, Lucia; Paternina Quesada, Natalia; González-Giraldo, Constanza; Cárdenas Rodríguez, Martha Lucia; Castillo Gutiérrez, Ana María; Garzón-Lawton, Mario; Ronderos-Bernal, Camila; García Guarín, Bibiana; Acevedo-Peña, Juan Ramón; Gómez-Gómez, Olga Victoria; Yomayusa-González, Nancy",Rev. colomb. psiquiatr,,672

We discuss limited transmissibility of the virus by asymptomatic and mild cases of COVID-19 patients in Bhutan. We followed up the secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the contacts of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients in Bhutan. Bhutan had 33 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country as of May 29, 2020. Of these, 22 (67%) were females. Except the first two cases (American tourists), the rest were Bhutanese living outside the country. The mean age of the Bhutanese patients was 26.3 (range 16-33) years. Close contacts of 27 of the 33 cases were followed up for signs and symptoms and COVID-19 positivity. The first two cases had 73 and 97 primary contacts, respectively, and equal number of secondary contacts (224). From the third case, a mandatory 21-day facility quarantine was instituted, all primary contacts were facility quarantined, and there were no secondary contacts. In total, the 27 cases had 1,095 primary contacts and 448 secondary contacts. Of these, 75 individuals were categorized as definite high-risk contacts. Secondary transmission occurred in seven high-risk contacts. Therefore, the overall secondary transmission was 9.0% (7/75) and 0.6% (7/1,095) among the high-risk and primary contacts, respectively. No transmission occurred in the secondary contacts. In contrast to several reports indicating high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in contacts of confirmed cases, the mostly young, asymptomatic, and mild cases of COVID-19 in Bhutan showed limited secondary transmission.","Tshokey, Tshokey; Choden, Jamyang; Dorjee, Kinley; Pempa, Pempa; Yangzom, Pema; Gyeltshen, Wangdi; Wangchuk, Sonam; Dorji, Tandin; Wangmo, Dechen",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,672

three diseases - human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, syphilis and hepatitis B Significant progress towards triple elimination has been made in some regions, but progress has been slow in sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the highest burden of these diseases The shared features of the three diseases, including their epidemiology, disease interactions and core interventions for tackling them, enable an integrated healthsystems approach for elimination of mother-to-child transmission Current barriers to triple elimination in sub-Saharan Africa include a lack of policies, strategies and resources to support the uptake of wellestablished preventive and treatment interventions While much can be achieved with existing tools, the development of new products and models of care, as well as a prioritized research agenda, are needed to accelerate progress on triple elimination in sub-Saharan Africa In this paper we aim to show that health systems working together with communities in sub-Saharan Africa could deliver rapid and sustainable results towards the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of all three diseases However, stronger political support, expansion of evidence-based interventions and better use of funding streams are needed to improve efficiency and build on the successes in prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV Triple elimination is a strategic opportunity to reduce the morbidity and mortality from HIV infection, syphilis and hepatitis B for mothers and their infants within the context of universal health

317610,Situación epidemiológica del Covid-19 en Sudamérica,2020,"The perinatal consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection are still largely unknown. This study aimed to describe the features and outcomes of pregnant women with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection after the universal screening was established in a large tertiary care center admitting only obstetric related conditions without severe COVID-19 in Mexico City. This retrospective case-control study integrates data between April 22 and May 25, 2020, during active community transmission in Mexico, with one of the highest COVID-19 test positivity percentages worldwide. Only pregnant women and neonates with a SARS-CoV-2 result by quantitative RT-PCR were included in this study. Among 240 pregnant women, the prevalence of COVID-19 was 29% (95% CI, 24% to 35%); 86% of the patients were asymptomatic (95% CI, 76%-92%), nine women presented mild symptoms, and one patient moderate disease. No pregnancy baseline features or risk factors associated with severity of infection, including maternal age > 35 years, Body Mass Index >30 kg/m2, and pre-existing diseases, differed between positive and negative women. The median gestational age at admission for both groups was 38 weeks. All women were discharged at home without complications, and no maternal death was reported. The proportion of preeclampsia was higher in positive women than negative women (18%, 95% CI, 10%-29% vs. 9%, 95% CI, 5%-14%, P<0.05). No differences were found for other perinatal outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 test result was positive for nine infants of positive mothers detected within 24h of birth. An increased number of infected neonates were admitted to the NICU, compared to negative neonates (44% vs. 22%, P<0.05) and had a longer length of hospitalization (2 [2-18] days vs. 2 [2-3] days, P<0.001); these are potential proxies for illness severity. This report highlights the importance of COVID-19 detection at delivery in pregnant women living in high transmission areas.","Cardona-Pérez, J Arturo; Villegas-Mota, Isabel; Helguera-Repetto, A Cecilia; Acevedo-Gallegos, Sandra; Rodríguez-Bosch, Mario; Aguinaga-Ríos, Mónica; Coronado-Zarco, Irma; León-Juárez, Moisés; Aguilar-Ayala, Diana; Valdespino-Vázquez, María Yolotzin; Moreno-Verduzco, Elsa Romelia; Rivera, María Antonieta; Valencia-Contreras, Carolina; Gómez-Sousa, María de Lourdes; Solis-Paredes, Mario; Frías-Madrid, Brenda; Velasco-Téllez, César; Rodriguez-Aldama, Juan Carlos; Avila-Sosa, Valeria; Galván-Contreras, Rafael; Figueroa-Damian, Ricardo; Cortés-Bonilla, Manuel; Estrada-Gutierrez, Guadalupe; Espino-Y-Sosa, Salvador; Irles, Claudine",PLoS One,,672

If this event is something such radical and dramatic like the COVID-19 pandemic, these solutions must aim to guarantee as much normality as possible while protecting lives. After a moment of shock our university decided that the students have to be able to pursue their studies for guaranteeing a degree in the expected time since most of them faced immediate financial problems due to the loss of their student jobs. This implied, for us as teachers, that we had to reorganise not only the teaching methods from nearly one day to the next, but we also had to come up with an adjusted way of examinations which had to take place in person with pen and paper under strict hygiene rules. On the other hand the correction should avoid personal contacts. We developed a framework which allowed us to correct the digitalised exams safely at home while providing the high standards given by the general data protection regulation of our country. Moreover, the time spent in the offices could be reduced to a minimum thanks to automatically generated exam sheets, automatically re-digitalised and sorted worked-on exams.","Fleischmann, Pamela; Kulczynski, Mitja; Nowotka, Dirk",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04014v1.pdf,672
318313,Covid-19 and the Return of the State in Africa,2021,"PURPOSE: To examine how treatment delays brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the physical and emotional well-being of physicians treating these patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of physician breast specialists was posted from April 23rd to June 11th, 2020 on membership list serves and social media platforms of the National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers and the American Society of Breast Surgeons. Physician well-being was measured using 6 COVID-19 burnout emotions and the 4-item PROMIS short form for anxiety and sleep disturbance. We examined associations between treatment delays and physician well-being, adjusting for demographic factors, COVID-19 testing and ten COVID-19 pandemic concerns. RESULTS: 870 physicians completed the survey, 61% were surgeons. The mean age of physicians was 52 and 548 (63.9%) were female. 669 (79.4%) reported some delay in patient care as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 384 (44.1%) and 529 (60.8%) of physicians scored outside normal limits for anxiety and sleep disturbance, respectively. After adjusting for demographic factors and COVID-19 testing, mean anxiety and COVID-19 burnout scores were significantly higher among physicians whose patients experienced either delays in surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, radiation, breast imaging or specialty consultation. A multivariable model adjusting for ten physician COVID-19 concerns and delays showed that ""delays will impact my emotional well-being"" was the strongest concern associated with anxiety, sleep disturbance and COVID-19 burnout factors. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer treatment delays during the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States were associated with a negative impact on physician emotional wellness.","Yao, Katharine A; Attai, Deanna; Bleicher, Richard; Kuchta, Kristine; Moran, Meena; Boughey, Judy; Wilke, Lee G; Dietz, Jill R; Stevens, Randy; Pesce, Catherine; Kopkash, Katherine; Kurtzman, Scott; Sarantou, Terry; Victorson, David",Breast cancer res. treat,,672

Singapore launched the first Bluetooth-based contact tracing app-TraceTogether-in March 2020 to augment Singapore's contact tracing capabilities. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the performance of the contact tracing app-TraceTogether-with that of a wearable tag-based real-time locating system (RTLS) and to validate them against the electronic medical records at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), the national referral center for COVID-19 screening. METHODS: All patients and physicians in the NCID screening center were issued RTLS tags (CADI Scientific) for contact tracing. In total, 18 physicians were deployed to the NCID screening center from May 10 to May 20, 2020. The physicians activated the TraceTogether app (version 1.6; GovTech) on their smartphones during shifts and urged their patients to use the app. We compared patient contacts identified by TraceTogether and those identified by RTLS tags within the NCID vicinity during physicians' 10-day posting. We also validated both digital contact tracing tools by verifying the physician-patient contacts with the electronic medical records of 156 patients who attended the NCID screening center over a 24-hour time frame within the study period. RESULTS: RTLS tags had a high sensitivity of 95.3% for detecting patient contacts identified either by the system or TraceTogether while TraceTogether had an overall sensitivity of 6.5% and performed significantly better on Android phones than iPhones (Android: 9.7%, iPhone: 2.7%; P<.001). When validated against the electronic medical records, RTLS tags had a sensitivity of 96.9% and specificity of 83.1%, while TraceTogether only detected 2 patient contacts with physicians who did not attend to them. CONCLUSIONS: TraceTogether had a much lower sensitivity than RTLS tags for identifying patient contacts in a clinical setting. Although the tag-based RTLS performed well for contact tracing in a clinical setting, its implementation in the community would be more challenging than TraceTogether. Given the uncertainty of the adoption and capabilities of contact tracing apps, policy makers should be cautioned against overreliance on such apps for contact tracing. Nonetheless, leveraging technology to augment conventional manual contact tracing is a necessary move for returning some normalcy to life during the long haul of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Huang, Zhilian; Guo, Huiling; Lee, Yee-Mun; Ho, Eu Chin; Ang, Hou; Chow, Angela",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,672
318410,Resposta ao artigo “o que a medicina social latino-americana pode contribuir para os debates globais sobre as políticas da covid-19: Lições do Brasil”,2021,"Digital government innovation is being recognised as a solution to many problems faced by governments in providing services to their citizens. It is especially important for low-income countries where there are resource constraints. This research was aimed at exploring the moderating effect of gender on the adoption of a digital government innovation in Ethiopia based on the UTAUT model (n=270) and using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results reveal that gender only moderates the relationship between facilitating conditions and usage behavior of government employees to adopt the digital government innovation which is inconsistent with other findings. Another key finding was that even though the innovation was regarded as not being easy to use, women identified that they would still use it because of the social influence from the peers and the bosses. This finding suggests that women government employees who obtain external support are more likely to use digital government innovations compared with men who are unlikely to use it even if they were facilitated. The paper recommends that governments of low-income countries like Ethiopia should design appropriate policies that encourage women in digital government.","Senshaw, Debas; Twinomurinzi, Hossana",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09960v1.pdf,672

Whether to confirm the disappearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA (RNAemia) in convalescent donor blood or not is unclear. Reports recommending the proof of viral disappearance from the blood are controversial. Foreseeing CPT in treating COVID-19 patients in Japan, we investigated RNAemia in 100 convalescent donors with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19. METHODS: Between April 30 and July 30, 2020, we measured RNAemia in the plasma samples of donors with resolved COVID-19. Data on patients' demographics, comorbidities, pneumonia, treatment, and real-time polymerase chain reaction results for SARS-CoV-2 were collected. Date of onset of initial symptoms or date of positive testing (for asymptomatic patients) were self-reported by the patients. Disease severity was defined as: no, mild, moderate oxygen demand, or severe (requiring mechanical ventilation). RESULTS: Of 100 donors (58 males [58.0%]; median age, 47 [range 22-69] years) screened as of July 30, 2020, 77 (77.0%); 19 (19.0%); and 4 (4.0%) had mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively. Median time between onset and testing was 68.5 (range, 21-167) days. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any of the plasma samples. CONCLUSION: RNAemia was not found in recovered COVID-19 patients at least 21, 27, and 57 days after the onset of mild, moderate, and severe symptoms. Our study may contribute to determining a suitable time for collecting convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients and to future CPT use.","Nomoto, Hidetoshi; Kutsuna, Satoshi; Okuma, Kazu; Kuramitsu, Madoka; Tezuka, Kenta; Ikebe, Emi; Saito, Sho; Kinoshita, Noriko; Terada, Mari; Endo, Mio; Suzuki, Tetsuya; Miyazato, Yusuke; Nakamoto, Takato; Inada, Makoto; Hamaguchi, Isao; Ohmagari, Norio",J. infect. chemother,,672

Human highly pathogenic coronaviruses are composed of non-structural proteins, structural proteins, accessory proteins and ribonucleic acid. Viral particles recognize host receptors via spike glycoprotein (S protein), enter host cells by membrane fusion, replicate in host cells through large replication-transcription complexes, and promote proliferation by interfering with and suppressing the host's immune response. Highly pathogenic human coronaviruses are hosted by humans and vertebrates. Viral particles are transmitted through droplets, contact and aerosols or likely through digestive tract, urine, eyes and other routes. This review discusses the mechanisms of replication and transmission of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses providing basis for future studies on interrupting the transmission and pathogenicity of these pathogenic viruses.","He, Yeyan; Zheng, Chanying",Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,,672

METHODS: A survey was conducted of the tutors of rehabilitation departments. The questionnaire contained 31 questions divided into 6 parts about the following: general information on the department, adaptation of rehabilitation departments to the COVID pandemic, clinical work of rehabilitation physicians, the approach to rehabilitation in COVID patients, and the effects of the pandemic on the health and teaching activity of rehabilitation physicians during this period. RESULTS: A total of 54 responses were obtained. Almost half of the departments cancelled face-to-face medical consultations (40%) and 48% of the treatment rooms were turned into COVID beds. In 30 hospitals (55.6%), the physicians worked in COVID units. Most of the rehabilitation departments developed both graphic and audiovisual material with exercises, referral protocols and guidelines for the rehabilitation management and treatment of COVID 19 patients. Half of the departments reported some anxiety symptoms in medical staff. Tutorial work has been cancelled (40.7%) or reduced (35.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The organisation of Spanish rehabilitation departments in response to the COVID pandemic has been very similar throughout the country.

Here, the capability of the nanofountain probe electroporation (NFP-E) system to deliver proteins and plasmids in a variety of continuous and primary cell types with appropriate dosage control is reported. It is shown that the NFP-E can achieve fine control over the relative expression of two cotransfected plasmids. Finally, the dynamics of electropore closure after the pulsing ends with the NFP-E is investigated. Localized electroporation has recently been utilized to demonstrate the converse process of delivery (sampling), in which a small volume of the cytosol is retrieved during electroporation without causing cell lysis. Single-cell temporal sampling confers the benefit of monitoring the same cell over time and can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying processes such as stem cell differentiation and disease progression. NFP-E parameters that maximize the membrane resealing time, which is essential for increasing the sampled volume and in meeting the challenge of monitoring low copy number biomarkers, are identified. Its application in CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, stem cell reprogramming, and single-cell sampling studies is envisioned.","Nathamgari, Samba Shiva Prasad; Pathak, Nibir; Lemaitre, Vincent; Mukherjee, Prithvijit; Muldoon, Joseph J; Peng, Chian-Yu; McGuire, Tammy; Leonard, Joshua N; Kessler, John A; Espinosa, Horacio Dante",Small,,672

More recently, it has been demonstrated that transmembrane protease serine 4 (TMPRSS4) along with TMPRSS2 activate the SARS­CoV­2 S proteins, and enhance the viral infection of human small intestinal enterocytes. To date, a systematic analysis of TMPRSS4 in health and disease is lacking. In the present study, using in silico tools, the gene expression and genetic alteration of TMPRSS4 were analysed across numerous tumours and compared to controls. The observations were also expanded to the level of the central nervous system (CNS). The findings revealed that TMPRSS4 was overexpressed in 11 types of cancer, including lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, ovarian cancer, cancer of the rectum, pancreatic cancer, colon and stomach adenocarcinoma, uterine carcinosarcoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, whilst it was significantly downregulated in kidney carcinomas, acute myeloid leukaemia, skin cutaneous melanoma and testicular germ cell tumours. Finally, a high TMPRSS4 expression was documented in the olfactory tubercle, paraolfactory gyrus and frontal operculum, all brain regions which are associated with the sense of smell and taste. Collectively, these data suggest that TMPRSS4 may play a role in COVID­19 symptomatology as another SARS­CoV­2 host cell entry mediator responsible for the tropism of this coronavirus both in the periphery and the CNS.","Katopodis, Periklis; Kerslake, Rachel; Davies, Julie; Randeva, Harpal S; Chatha, Kamaljit; Hall, Marcia; Spandidos, Demetrios A; Anikin, Vladimir; Polychronis, Andreas; Robertus, Jan L; Kyrou, Ioannis; Karteris, Emmanouil",Int. j. mol. med,,672

With the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, the safety of NSAIDs use has been called into question. These concerns are worthy of review. At present, there is no compelling data showing that NSAIDs worsen the severity of COVID-19 symptoms or increase one's likelihood of contracting the illness. For patients in pain and without symptoms that could potentially be attributed to COVID-19 (cough, fevers/chills, lethargy, myalgias, anosmia and so on), NSAIDs should continue to remain a viable option to provide analgesia to patients in need.","Herzberg, Daniel L; Sukumaran, Harry P; Viscusi, Eugene",Reg Anesth Pain Med,,672
332780,Healthcare system capacity of the municipalities in the State of Rio de Janeiro: infrastructure to confront COVID-19,2020,"This paper introduces HeBERT and HebEMO. HeBERT is a Transformer-based model for modern Hebrew text, which relies on a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers) architecture. BERT has been shown to outperform alternative architectures in sentiment analysis, and is suggested to be particularly appropriate for MRLs. Analyzing multiple BERT specifications, we find that while model complexity correlates with high performance on language tasks that aim to understand terms in a sentence, a more-parsimonious model better captures the sentiment of entire sentence. Either way, out BERT-based language model outperforms all existing Hebrew alternatives on all common language tasks. HebEMO is a tool that uses HeBERT to detect polarity and extract emotions from Hebrew UGC. HebEMO is trained on a unique Covid-19-related UGC dataset that we collected and annotated for this study. Data collection and annotation followed an active learning procedure that aimed to maximize predictability. We show that HebEMO yields a high F1-score of 0.96 for polarity classification. Emotion detection reaches F1-scores of 0.78-0.97 for various target emotions, with the exception of surprise, which the model failed to capture (F1 = 0.41). These results are better than the best-reported performance, even among English-language models of emotion detection.","Chriqui, Avihay; Yahav, Inbal",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01909v3.pdf,672

The fusion of these wearable technologies in sporting garments can allow the objective assessment of the quality and the quantity of the muscle activity as well as the continuous monitoring of exercise programs. Several prototypes integrating EMG and NIRS have been developed previously; however, most devices presented the limitations of not measuring regional muscle oxyhemoglobin saturation and did not embed textile sensors for EMG. The purpose of this study was to compare regional muscle oxyhemoglobin saturation and surface EMG data, measured under resting and dynamic conditions (treadmill run and strength exercises) by a recently developed wearable integrated quadriceps muscle oximetry/EMG system adopting smart textiles for EMG, with those obtained by using two ""gold standard"" commercial instrumentations for EMG and muscle oximetry. The validity and agreement between the wearable integrated muscle oximetry/EMG system and the ""gold standard"" instrumentations were assessed by using the Bland-Altman agreement plots to determine the bias. The results support the validity of the data provided by the wearable electronic garment developed purposely for the quadriceps muscle group and suggest the potential of using such device to measure strength and endurance exercises in vivo in various populations.","Di Giminiani, Riccardo; Cardinale, Marco; Ferrari, Marco; Quaresima, Valentina",,,672

339773,Food security and COVID-19 in Latin America: A challenge to overcome,2021,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare facilities worldwide have been overwhelmed by the amount of coronavirus patients needed to be served. Similarly, the U.S. also experienced a shortage of healthcare resources, which led to a reduction in the efficiency of the whole healthcare system. In order to evaluate this from a transportation perspective, it is critical to understand the extent to which healthcare facilities with intensive care unit (ICU) beds are available in both urban and rural areas. As such, this study aims to assess the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 patients to healthcare facilities in the State of Florida. For this purpose, two methods were used: the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) and the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA). These methods were applied to identify the high and low access areas in the entire state. Furthermore, a metric, namely the Accessibility Ratio Difference (ARD), was developed to evaluate the spatial access difference between the models. Results revealed that many areas in the northwest and southern Florida have lower access compared to other locations. The residents in central Florida (e.g., Tampa and Orlando cities) had the highest level of accessibility given their higher access ratios. We also observed that the 2SFCA method overestimates the accessibility in the areas with a lower number of ICU beds due to the ""equal access"" assumption of the population within the catchment area. The findings of this study can provide valuable insights and information for state officials and decision makers in the field of public health.","Ghorbanzadeh, Mahyar; Kim, Kyusik; Erman Ozguven, Eren; Horner, Mark W",,,672

Methods: Women with a recent diagnosis (3 months) of non based telehealth psychosocial intervention for this understudied patient population. Methods: Women with a recent diagnosis (3 months) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) currently undergoing treatment completed baseline measures of computer literacy and were randomized to a group-based telehealth psychosocial intervention consisting of ether coping skills or attention control (AC) psychoeducation. Both arms consisted of five, 60 min. telehealth (video conference over Zoom) sessions. Groups were comprised of 3-5 members and led by a masters-level clinician. Participants completed one ""practice run"" with technology prior to starting the group session. After the final session, patients rated overall experience of intervention delivery and telehealth platform. Results: Seventy patients (mean age= 66 yrs, 54% &gt;65 yrs;71% non-Hispanic White;50% college educated;75% advanced stage) consented (63% consent rate) and 65 were randomized to intervention or AC. At baseline, 47% of patients indicated daily computer use while 50% said they rarely or never use a computer. Attendance was high in both arms with 63% of patients attending all sessions (means: intervention = 3.18;AC = 3.56). Across arms, 89% preferred group delivery and 92% preferred online delivery.

Report of a clinical case./ Perforación intestinal en paciente COVID-19 en tratamiento con tocilizumab y corticoides. A propósito de un caso,2020,"BACKGROUND: People with developmental disabilities (DD) are a population at high-risk for poor outcomes related to COVID-19. COVID-19-specific risks, including greater comorbidities and congregate living situations in persons with DD compound existing health disparities. With their expertise in care of persons with DD and understanding of basic principles of infection control, DD nurses are well-prepared to advocate for the needs of people with DD during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To assess the challenges faced by nurses caring for persons with DD during the COVID-19 pandemic and how the challenges impact people with DD. METHODS: We surveyed 556 DD nurses, from April 6-20, 2020. The 35-item mixed-method survey asked nurses to rate the degree of challenges faced in meeting the care needs of people with DD. We analyzed responses based on presence of COVID-19 in the care setting and geographically. One open-ended question elicited challenges not included in the survey, which we analyzed using manifest content analysis. RESULTS: Startlingly, nurses reported being excluded from COVID-19 planning, and an absence of public health guidelines specific to persons with DD, despite their high-risk status. Obtaining PPE and sanitizers and meeting social-behavioral care needs were the most highly ranked challenges. COVID-19 impacted nurses' ability to maintain adequate staffing and perform essential aspects of care. No significant geographic differences were noted. CONCLUSIONS: DD nurses must be involved in public health planning and policy development to ensure that basic care needs of persons with DD are met, and the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 in this vulnerable population is reduced.","Desroches, Melissa L; Ailey, Sarah; Fisher, Kathleen; Stych, Judith",Disabil Health J,,672

344536,Possible effects of ayurvedic herbs on management of COVID-19,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoVs) are zoonotic pathogens with high fatality rates and pandemic potential. Vaccine development focuses on the principal target of the neutralizing humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein. Coronavirus S proteins are extensively glycosylated, encoding around 66-87 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. Here, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on MERS S that results in the formation of oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which were absent on SARS and HKU1 CoVs. We provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes with other viral proteins including HIV-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic epitopes. Overall, our data reveal how organisation of glycosylation across class I viral fusion proteins influence not only individual glycan compositions but also the immunological pressure across the protein surface.","Watanabe, Yasunori; Berndsen, Zachary T; Raghwani, Jayna; Seabright, Gemma E; Allen, Joel D; Pybus, Oliver G; McLellan, Jason S; Wilson, Ian A; Bowden, Thomas A; Ward, Andrew B; Crispin, Max",Nat Commun,,672

In 2016, alcohol use caused 2.2% of female deaths and 6.8% of male deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were 2.3% in female and 8.9% in male. Individuals with alcohol use disorder are at high risk of anxiety, depression, impaired cognition performance, and illicit drug use and are comorbid with liver disease, such as alcoholic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, which is a major cause of personal death and disability worldwide. Psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy and motivational interviewing, as well as medical treatments, such as disulfiram, naltrexone, acamprosate, and nalmefene, are used for the treatment of alcohol addiction in Europe and the United States. However, the effect of current interventions is limited, and the need for additional interventions is substantial. Alcohol use impairs the intestinal barrier and causes changes to the intestinal permeability as well as the gut microbiota composition. Emerging studies have tried to reveal the role of the gut-brain axis among individuals with alcohol use disorder with or without alcohol liver disease. Bacterial products penetrate the impaired intestinal barrier and cause central inflammation; changes to the gut microbiota impair enterohepatic circulation of bile acids; alcohol abuse causes shortage of vital nutrients such as thiamine. Several studies have suggested that probiotics, through either oral administration or fecal microbiota transplantation, increased intestinal levels of potentially beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, improving the levels of liver-associated enzymes in patients with mild alcoholic hepatitis, and demonstrating beneficial psychotropic effects on anxiety and depression. In addition to medications for alcohol addiction, gene editing therapy such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) may be another potential research target. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which are associated with ADH and ALDH genes, are major enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism, and gene editing approaches may have the potential to directly modify specific genes to treat alcoholism caused by genetic defects. Further research is needed to study the effect of the combined treatment for alcohol addiction.","Wang, Shao-Cheng; Chen, Yuan-Chuan; Chen, Shaw-Ji; Lee, Chun-Hung; Cheng, Ching-Ming",,,672
345701,Need for recognition of pharmacists as front liners in COVID-19 pandemic: An Indian perspective,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed healthcare for both clinicians and patients. This conceptual article uses ideas from the moral distress literature to understand the challenges MedFTs and physicians face during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors highlight earlier themes from the moral distress literature and share current reflections to illustrate similar challenges. Some clinicians who were already experiencing a rise in burnout due to the mass digitization of healthcare are now facing increased moral distress due to ethical dilemmas, pervasive uncertainty, boundary ambiguity, isolation, and burnout brought about by emerging COVID-19 policies. Fears about personal safety, exposing loved ones, financial concerns, self-doubt, and frustrations with telehealth have contributed to increased moral distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Building resilience by setting one's personal moral compass can help clinicians avoid the pitfalls of moral distress. Five steps for developing resilience and implications for guiding trainees in developing resilience are discussed.","Patterson, Jo E; Edwards, Todd M; Griffith, James L; Wright, Sarah",J Marital Fam Ther,,672

Successful, effective, and efficient drive-through facilities require a suitable site and keen focus on layout and process design. To demonstrate the role that high fidelity computer simulation can play in planning and design of drive-through mass vaccination clinics, we used multiple integrated discrete event simulation (DES) and agent-based modelling methods. This method using AnyLogic simulation software to aid in planning, design, and implementation of one of the largest and most successful early COVID-19 mass vaccination clinics operated by UCHealth in Denver, Colorado. Simulations proved to be helpful in aiding the optimization of UCHealth drive through mass vaccination clinic design and operations by exposing potential bottlenecks, overflows, and queueing, and clarifying the necessary number of supporting staff. Simulation results informed the target number of vaccinations and necessary processing times for different drive through station set ups and clinic formats.

We analyze data obtained from a Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 database to assess the county-level spatial variation of COVID-19-related mortality risk during the early stage of the epidemic in relation to health determinants and health infrastructure. Overall, we identified highly populated and polluted areas, regional air hub areas, race minorities (non-white population), and Hispanic or Latino population with an increased risk of COVID-19-related death during the first phase of the epidemic. The 10 highest COVID-19 mortality risk areas in highly populated counties had on average a lower proportion of white population (48.0%) and higher proportions of black population (18.7%) and other races (33.3%) compared to the national averages of 83.0%, 9.1%, and 7.9%, respectively. The Hispanic and Latino population proportion was higher in these 10 counties (29.3%, compared to the national average of 9.3%). Counties with major air hubs had a 31% increase in mortality risk compared to counties with no airport connectivity. Sixty-eight percent of the counties with high COVID-19-related mortality risk also had lower critical care capacity than the national average. The disparity in health and environmental risk factors might have exacerbated the COVID-19-related mortality risk in vulnerable groups during the early stage of the epidemic.","Correa-Agudelo, Esteban; Mersha, Tesfaye B; Branscum, Adam J; MacKinnon, Neil J; Cuadros, Diego F",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,672

Prior to SARS-CoV-2 emergence, high throughput screens utilizing clinically developed drugs identified compounds with in vitro inhibitory effect on human coronaviruses that may have potential for repurposing as treatment options for COVID-19. However, caution should be applied to repurposing of these drugs when they are taken out of context of human pharmacokinetic parameters associated with normal therapeutic use. METHODS: Our aim was to provide a tier-based scoring system to interrogate this data set and match each drug with its human pharmacokinetic criteria, such as route of administration, therapeutic plasma levels and half-life, tissue distribution, and safety. RESULTS: Our analysis excluded most previously identified drugs but identified members of 4 drug classes (antimalarial amino-quinolones, selective estrogen receptor modulators; SERMs, low potency tricyclic antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants) as potential drug candidates for COVID-19. Two of them, the tricyclic antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants were further excluded based on a high adverse event profile. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our findings using a new pharmacokinetic-based scoring system supports efficacy testing of only a minority of candidates against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Jarvis, Michael A; Hansen, Frederick A; Rosenke, Kyle; Haddock, Elaine; Rollinson, Christopher; Rule, Simon; Sewell, Graham; Hughes, Andrew; Feldmann, Heinz",Antivir. ther,,672

METHODS: This was a prospective study that enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) followed at a primary healthcare unit in São Paulo, Brazil. After a brief training in image acquisition, there was further continuous feedback given by a retina specialist during the remote image reading process. Each patient underwent two fundus and one anterior ocular segment images per eye, after mydriasis. Patients were classified according to the need of referral. RESULTS: A total of 627 adult individuals with T2DM underwent retinal evaluation. The population was composed by 63.2% female individuals, age median of 66 years, diabetes duration 10.7 ± 8.2 years and HbA1c 7.7 ± 1.9% (61 + 20.8 mmol/mol). The most prevalent associated comorbidities were arterial hypertension (80.3%) and dyslipidemia (50.2%). Referral decision was possible in 81.2% patients. Most patients had absent or non-referable DR; the main ocular media opacity detected was cataract. After the 7th day of image acquisition, the daily rate of patients whose images allowed clinical decision was maintained above 80%. A higher HbA1c was associated with referable DR.

Early data suggest higher rate of ischemic stroke in severe COVID-19 infection. We evaluated whether a relationship exists between emergent large vessel occlusion (ELVO) and the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational case series. Data were collected from all patients who presented with ELVO to the Mount Sinai Health System Hospitals across New York City during the peak 3 weeks of hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Patients' demographic, comorbid conditions, cardiovascular risk factors, COVID-19 disease status, and clinical presentation were extracted from the electronic medical record. Comparison was made between COVID-19 positive and negative cohorts. The incidence of ELVO stroke was compared with the pre-COVID period. RESULTS: Forty-five consecutive ELVO patients presented during the observation period. Fifty-three percent of patients tested positive for COVID-19. Total patients' mean (±SD) age was 66 (±17). Patients with COVID-19 were significantly younger than patients without COVID-19, 59±13 versus 74±17 (odds ratio [95% CI], 0.94 [0.81-0.98]; P=0.004). Seventy-five percent of patients with COVID-19 were male compared with 43% of patients without COVID-19 (odds ratio [95% CI], 3.99 [1.12-14.17]; P=0.032). Patients with COVID-19 were less likely to be White (8% versus 38% [odds ratio (95% CI), 0.15 (0.04-0.81); P=0.027]). In comparison to a similar time duration before the COVID-19 outbreak, a 2-fold increase in the total number of ELVO was observed (estimate: 0.78 [95% CI, 0.47-1.08], P&#8804;0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the ELVO stroke patients during the peak time of the New York City's COVID-19 outbreak were COVID-19 positive, and those patients with COVID-19 were younger, more likely to be male, and less likely to be White. Our findings also suggest an increase in the incidence of ELVO stroke during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Majidi, Shahram; Fifi, Johanna T; Ladner, Travis R; Lara-Reyna, Jacques; Yaeger, Kurt A; Yim, Benjamin; Dangayach, Neha; Oxley, Thomas J; Shigematsu, Tomoyoshi; Kummer, Benjamin R; Stein, Laura K; Weinberger, Jesse; Fara, Michael G; De Leacy, Reade; Dhamoon, Mandip S; Tuhrim, Stanley; Mocco, J",Stroke,,672

This is an important issue, as globally there are approximately one billion people with disabilities. This number includes one in three people aged over 60, who are the group at greatest risk from COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic in the UK has highlighted additional difficulties that disabled people may face. Complying with preventative measures, like social distancing, can be challenging, particular for people who rely on carers. Disabled people may also be at greater risk of morbidity and mortality if they contract the virus, yet in danger of being de-prioritised for care. Many people with disabilities have ongoing healthcare needs, and these need to still be supported during the pandemic. Furthermore, people may become newly disabled as a result of the pandemic, and therefore require appropriate care. Good practice examples have emerged for meeting these challenges, such as guidance for healthcare professionals on treating people with dementia, but these need to be scaled up further and adapted for other settings. In conclusion, it is clear that a disability-inclusive COVID-19 response is needed, both in the UK and as the pandemic unfolds globally. This response will require inclusion of disability measures within data collection, consulting with disabled people, and tailoring responses to be appropriate for this group.","Kuper, Hannah; Banks, Lena Morgon; Bright, Tess; Davey, Calum; Shakespeare, Tom",Wellcome Open Res.,,672

Non-adherence was associated with being male, younger age, having a dependent child in the household, lower socioeconomic grade, greater financial hardship during the pandemic, and working in a key sector. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of adherence to test, trace, and isolate are low, although some improvement has occurred over time. Practical support and financial reimbursement are likely to improve adherence. Targeting messaging and policies to men, younger age groups, and key workers might also be necessary.","Smith, Louise E; Potts, Henry W W; Amlôt, Richard; Fear, Nicola T; Michie, Susan; Rubin, G James",BMJ,,672

The absence of pharmacological interventions has pushed governments to apply different sets of old, non-pharmacological interventions, which are, though temporary, helpful to prevent further pandemic propagation. In the context of COVID-19, research confirms that quarantine is useful, mainly if applied early and if combined with other public health measures. However, the efficacy of quarantine and isolation is limited in many ways, ranging from legal issues and suspension of economic activities to mental health considerations. This chapter is an exploration of (i) epidemiological impact of isolation and quarantine; (ii) emotional impact of isolation and quarantine; and (iii) the possible effect of culture on quarantine experience.","Mojtabavi, Helia; Javidi, Nasirudin; Naviaux, Anne-Frédérique; Janne, Pascal; Gourdin, Maximilien; Mohammadpour, Mahsa; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Adv Exp Med Biol,,672

This patient displayed a borderline organisation of the schizoid type, with a marked false self presentation. To understand this work, I build on Winnicott’s theories, as well as Monica Lanyado’s ideas. Lanyado explores how the presence of the therapist and that of the therapy itself acquire functions beyond those commonly defined within the psychoanalytic framework–in this case, due to the nature of the collectively experienced phenomenon of the lockdown. Local circumstances, restrictions and realities in Cyprus are described, as they occurred at the time of the first Covid-19 lockdown, showing how the patient’s pathology became intertwined with the above conflicts and dilemmas that I faced as his psychotherapist, and as a fellow member of the local and global society. I argue that under such unusual conditions, psychotherapist and patient become part of the same local and global collective, and only if they work ‘hand in hand’ can they survive a collectively experienced trauma, at a time when most human contact was forbidden by law. © 2021 Association of Child Psychotherapists.","Antoniades, N.",Journal of Child Psychotherapy,,672

This study estimated the effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion on hospital finances in 2017 to update earlier findings. The analysis also explored how the ACA Medicaid expansion affects different types of hospitals by size, ownership, rurality, and safety-net status. We found that the early positive financial impact of Medicaid expansion was sustained in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 as hospitals in expansion states continued to experience decreased uncompensated care costs and increased Medicaid revenue and financial margins. The magnitude of these impacts varied by hospital type. As COVID-19 has brought hospitals to a time of great need, findings from this study provide important information on what hospitals in states that have yet to expand Medicaid could gain through expansion and what is at risk should any reversal of Medicaid expansions occur.","Blavin, Fredric; Ramos, Christal",Health Aff (Millwood),,672

In this study, we aimed to compare the clinical course of COVID-19 in adult SCD patients under the organ injury mitigation and clinical care improvement program (BASCARE) with healthcare professionals without significant comorbid conditions. The study was planned as a retrospective, multicenter and cross-sectional study. Thirty-nine SCD patients, ages 18 to 64 years, and 121 healthcare professionals, ages 21 to 53, were included in the study. The data were collected from the Electronic Health Recording System of PRANA, where SCD patients under the BASCARE program had been registered. The data of other patients were collected from the Electronic Hospital Data Recording System and patient files. In the SCD group, the crude incidence of COVID-19 was 9%, while in healthcare professionals at the same period was 23%. Among the symptoms, besides fever, loss of smell and taste were more prominent in the SCD group than in healthcare professionals. There was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of development of pneumonia, hospitalization, and need for intubation (43 vs 5%, P < 0.00001; 26 vs 7%, P = 0.002; and 10 vs 1%, P = 0.002, respectively). Prophylactic low molecular weight heparin and salicylate were used more in the SCD group than in healthcare professionals group (41 vs 9% and 28 vs 1%; P < 0.0001 for both). The 3-month mortality rate was demonstrated as 5% in the SCD group, while 0 in the healthcare professionals group. One patient in the SCD group became continously dependent on respiratory support. The cause of death was acute chest syndrome in the first case, hepatic necrosis and multi-organ failure in the second case. In conclusion, these observations supported the expectation that the course of COVID-19 in SCD patients will get worse. The BASCARE program applied in SCD patients could not change the poor outcome.","Boga, Can; Asma, Süheyl; Leblebisatan, Göksel; Sen, Nazan; Tombak, Anil; Demiroglu, Yusuf Ziya; Yeral, Mahmut; Akin, Sule; Yesilagaç, Hasan; Habesoglu, Mehmet Ali; Aribogan, Anis; Kasar, Mutlu; Korur, Asli; Özdogu, Hakan",Ann. hematol,,672

Informed by the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication Model and Health Belief Model, it proposes a conceptual model to study how people in Wuhan - the first epicenter of the global COVID-19 pandemic - used social media and its effects on users' mental health conditions and health behavior change. The results show that social media usage was related to both depression and secondary trauma, which also predicted health behavior change. But no relation was detected between health behavior change and mental health conditions. As the virus struck, social media usage was rewarding to Wuhan people who gained informational, emotional, and peer support from the health information shared on social media. An excessive use of social media, however, led to mental health issues. The results imply that taking a social media break may promote well-being during the pandemic, which is crucial to mitigating mental health harm inflicted by the pandemic.","Zhong, Bu; Huang, Yakun; Liu, Qian",Comput Human Behav,,672

Mature mRNA requires a 5'-cap for gene expression and mRNA stability. There are two methods to add a cap in vitro: via a two-step multi-enzymatic reaction or co-transcriptionally. Co-transcriptional methods minimize reaction steps and enzymes needed to make mRNA when compared to enzymatic capping. CleanCap® AG co-transcriptional capping results in 5 mg/ml of IVT with 94% 5'-cap 1 structure.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is perhaps one of the biggest threats to modern medicine; data show that 81% of antibiotics in the UK are prescribed in primary care. AIM: To identify where the perceived gaps in knowledge, skills, guidance and research around infections and antibiotic use lie from the general practitioner (GP) viewpoint. DESIGN AND SETTING: An online questionnaire survey. METHOD: The survey, based on questions asked of Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) members in 1999, and covering letter were electronically sent to GPs between May and August 2017 via various primary care dissemination routes. RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty-eight GPs responded. Suspected Infection in the elderly, recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), surveillance of AMR in the community, leg ulcers, persistent cough and cellulitis all fell into the top six conditions ranked in order of importance that require further research, evidence and guidance. Acute sore throat, otitis media and sinusitis were of lower importance than in 1999. CONCLUSION: This survey will help the NHS, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and researchers to prioritise for the development of guidance and research for chronic conditions highlighted for which there is little evidence base for diagnostic and management guidelines in primary care. In contrast, 20 years of investment into research, guidance and resources for acute respiratory infections have successfully reduced these as priority areas for GPs.","Lecky, Donna M; Granier, Steve; Allison, Rosalie; Verlander, Neville Q; Collin, Simon M; McNulty, Cliodna A M",,,672

Since the discovery of this disease in late 2019, COVID-19 has become a worldwide concern, mainly due to its high degree of contagion. As of April 2021, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported to the World Health Organization has already exceeded 135 million worldwide, while the number of deaths exceeds 2.9 million. Due to the impacts of the disease, efforts in the literature have intensified in terms of studying approaches aiming to detect COVID-19, with a focus on supporting and facilitating the process of disease diagnosis. This work proposes the application of texture descriptors based on phylogenetic relationships between species to characterize segmented CT volumes, and the subsequent classification of regions into COVID-19, solid lesion or healthy tissue. To evaluate our method, we use images from three different datasets. The results are promising, with an accuracy of 99.93%, a recall of 99.93%, a precision of 99.93%, an F1-score of 99.93%, and an AUC of 0.997.

The patient complained of prolonged fever and coughs for 7 days which had not improved after oral treatment with sultamicillin for 5 days, prescribed by the patient's general practitioner. Physical examination showed high blood pressure due to previously known hypertension. Other vital signs without pathological findings. Pulmonary auscultation showed basal soft crackling noises of the left lung FINDINGS AND DIAGNOSIS: Laboratory examination showed increased values for LDH, pro-BNP and CRP and normal values for leucocytes and procalcitonin. Conventional X-Ray of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral atypical infiltrates. After the first PCR turned in negative another PCR-analysis for SARS-CoV-2 of a deep oral swab-sample was performed since the clinical, laboratory and radiological findings were typical for COVID-19. Again, SARS-CoV-2-RNA was not detected. A CT-scan of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral ground-glass attenuation, again typical for COVID-19 associated pneumonia. After a third attempt for a PCR-analysis of a deep oral swab-sample was negative, analysis of a sputum was performed which finally confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. THERAPY AND COURSE OF EVENTS: The patient was admitted for evaluation of syncopes and suspect of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. The patient was prophylactically isolated while the result of SARS-CoV-2-PCR from a deep oral swab was pending. Suspecting a possible secondary bacterial infection at the beginning, intravenous antibiotic treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam was initiated. While further examinations showed no indication for bacterial infection, antibiotics were discontinued after 3 days. Due to clinical recovery antiviral therapy was not performed after confirming the diagnosis. The patient was discharged 17 days after onset of first symptoms without any requirements for further isolation. CONCLUSION: This casuistic describes a case of COVID-19 associated pneumonia presenting with typical clinical features, laboratory and radiological findings. Detection of viral RNA was not successful from deep oral swab-samples despite repeated attempts. Finally, PCR-analysis of sputum confirmed the diagnosis. Analysis of deeper airway samples (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal secretions) or stool for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed in cases of evident clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and negative PCR results from deep oral swabs.","Hornuss, Daniel; Laubner, Katharina; Monasterio, Carmen; Thimme, Robert; Wagner, Dirk",Dtsch Med Wochenschr,,672

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study included 1263 women with prior GDM and 705 women without GDM. Homeostatic model assessment was used to estimate homeostatic model assessment of ß-cell secretory function (HOMA-%ß) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). RESULTS: Multivariable-adjusted ORs of diabetes across quartiles of HOMA-%ß and HOMA-IR were 1.00, 1.46, 2.15, and 6.25 (ptrend <0.001), and 1.00, 2.11, 5.59, and 9.36 (ptrend <0.001), respectively. Women with IR only had the same diabetes risk as women with ß-cell dysfunction only. Obesity, together with IR or ß-cell dysfunction, had a stronger effect on diabetes risk. This stronger effect was also found for a history of GDM with IR or ß-cell dysfunction. Women with three risk factors, including obesity, a history of GDM and ß-cell dysfunction/IR, showed the highest ORs of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: ß-cell dysfunction or IR was significantly associated with postpartum diabetes. IR and ß-cell dysfunction, together with obesity and a history of GDM, had the highest ORs of postpartum diabetes risk.","Fan, Yuxin; Wang, Leishen; Liu, Huikun; Zhang, Shuang; Tian, Huiguang; Shen, Yun; Tuomilehto, Jaakko; Yu, Zhijie; Yang, Xilin; Hu, Gang; Liu, Ming",,,672

We assessed PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values and estimated VL in infected asymptomatic children diagnosed in nine pediatric hospital testing programs. Records for asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with positive clinical SARS-CoV-2 tests were reviewed. Ct values were (i) adjusted by centering each value around the institutional median Ct value from symptomatic children tested with that assay and (ii) converted to estimated VL (numbers of copies per milliliter) using internal or manufacturer data. Adjusted Ct values and estimated VL for asymptomatic versus symptomatic children (118 asymptomatic versus 197 symptomatic children aged 0 to 4 years, 79 asymptomatic versus 97 symptomatic children aged 5 to 9 years, 69 asymptomatic versus 75 symptomatic children aged 10 to 13 years, 73 asymptomatic versus 109 symptomatic children aged 14 to 17 years) were compared. The median adjusted Ct value for asymptomatic children was 10.3 cycles higher than for symptomatic children (P < 0.0001), and VL were 3 to 4 logs lower than for symptomatic children (P < 0.0001); differences were consistent (P < 0.0001) across all four age brackets. These differences were consistent across all institutions and by sex, ethnicity, and race. Asymptomatic children with diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 6.5; P = 0.01), a recent contact (OR, 2.3; P = 0.02), and testing for surveillance (OR, 2.7; P = 0.005) had higher estimated risks of having a Ct value in the lowest quartile than children without, while an immunocompromised status had no effect. Children with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection had lower levels of virus in their nasopharynx/oropharynx than symptomatic children, but the timing of infection relative to diagnosis likely impacted levels in asymptomatic children. Caution is recommended when choosing diagnostic tests for screening of asymptomatic children.","Kociolek, Larry K; Muller, William J; Yee, Rebecca; Dien Bard, Jennifer; Brown, Cameron A; Revell, Paula A; Wardell, Hanna; Savage, Timothy J; Jung, Sarah; Dominguez, Samuel; Parikh, Bijal A; Jerris, Robert C; Kehl, Sue C; Campigotto, Aaron; Bender, Jeffrey M; Zheng, Xiaotian; Muscat, Emily; Linam, Matthew; Abuogi, Lisa; Smith, Christiana; Graff, Kelly; Hernandez-Leyva, Ariel; Williams, David; Pollock, Nira R",J. clin. microbiol,,672

382021,Travailler ensemble à contenir et gérer la COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since 2019, a novel coronavirus named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged worldwide. Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute kidney injury has been observed in a few patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Furthermore, according to recent findings, the virus has been detected in urine. Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) has been proposed to serve as the receptor for the entry of 2019-nCoV, which is the same as that for the severe acute respiratory syndrome. This study aimed to investigate the possible cause of kidney damage and the potential route of 2019-nCoV infection in the urinary system. METHODS: We used both published kidney and bladder cell atlas data and new independent kidney single-cell RNA sequencing data generated in-house to evaluate ACE2 gene expression in all cell types in healthy kidneys and bladders. The Pearson correlation coefficients between ACE2 and all other genes were first generated. Then, genes with r values larger than 0.1 and P values smaller than 0.01 were deemed significant co-expression genes with ACE2. RESULTS: Our results showed the enriched expression of ACE2 in all subtypes of proximal tubule (PT) cells of the kidney. ACE2 expression was found in 5.12%, 5.80%, and 14.38% of the proximal convoluted tubule cells, PT cells, and proximal straight tubule cells, respectively, in three published kidney cell atlas datasets. In addition, ACE2 expression was also confirmed in 12.05%, 6.80%, and 10.20% of cells of the proximal convoluted tubule, PT, and proximal straight tubule, respectively, in our own two healthy kidney samples. For the analysis of public data from three bladder samples, ACE2 expression was low but detectable in bladder epithelial cells. Only 0.25% and 1.28% of intermediate cells and umbrella cells, respectively, had ACE2 expression. CONCLUSION: This study has provided bioinformatics evidence of the potential route of 2019-nCoV infection in the urinary system.","Lin, Wei; Fan, Jue; Hu, Long-Fei; Zhang, Yan; Ooi, Joshua D; Meng, Ting; Jin, Peng; Ding, Xiang; Peng, Long-Kai; Song, Lei; Tang, Rong; Xiao, Zhou; Ao, Xiang; Xiao, Xiang-Cheng; Zhou, Qiao-Ling; Xiao, Ping; Zhong, Yong",Chin Med J (Engl),,672

Previous studies found that access to testing has not been equitable across several sociodemographic indicators. This study documents the preferred testing locations and examines differences across sociodemographic factors with a specific focus on race and ethnicity. METHODS: This study includes a primary analysis of cross-sectional data using a self-administered digital survey distributed to Arkansas residents using ARresearch, a volunteer research participant registry. The survey had 1288 responses, and 1221 met eligibility criteria for inclusion in the survey. Participants provided sociodemographic information and were asked to select up to 3 preferred testing locations from 12 options. Chi-square tests assessed differences in testing site preference across relevant sociodemographic groups. RESULTS: Participants preferred drive-through clinics as their top location for COVID-19 testing, with 55% reporting this was their preferred method of testing. This pattern was consistent across all comparison groups (ie, age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, insurance status). Significant differences in testing location preference were observed across age, race and ethnicity, and education, with the most differences observed across race and ethnicity. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that race and ethnicity are important to consider when deciding where to offer COVID-19 testing. The preferences for testing locations among the most vulnerable demographics will be used to develop targeted responses aimed at eliminating disparities in COVID-19 in Arkansas.","McElfish, Pearl A; Willis, Don E; Bryant-Moore, Keneshia; Rojo, Martha O; Andersen, Jennifer A; Kaminicki, Kyle F; James, Laura P",J Prim Care Community Health,,672

Sporting events have been canceled or postponed, and even when baseball and basketball seasons resumed in the United States recently, no fans were in attendance. As play resumed, several players developed COVID-19, disrupting some of the schedules. A hypothesis now under scientific consideration is that taking vitamin supplements to raise serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations could quickly reduce the risk and/or severity of COVID-19. Several mechanisms have been identified through which vitamin D could reduce the risks of infection and severity, death, and long-haul effects of COVID-19: (1) inducing production of cathelicidin and defensins to reduce the survival and replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus; (2) reducing inflammation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines and risk of the ""cytokine storm"" that damages the epithelial layer of the lungs, heart, vascular system, and other organs; and (3) increasing production of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, thus limiting the amount of angiotensin II available to the virus to cause damage. Clinical trials have confirmed that vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of acute respiratory tract infections, and approximately 30 observational studies have shown that incidence, severity, and death from COVID-19 are inversely correlated with serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Vitamin D supplementation is already familiar to many athletes and sports teams because it improves athletic performance and increases playing longevity. Thus, athletes should consider vitamin D supplementation to serve as an additional means by which to reduce risk of COVID-19 and its consequences.","Grant, William B; Lahore, Henry; Rockwell, Michelle S",Nutrients,,672

Objective: To assess whether collaborative care vs usual care lowers depressive symptoms and improves cardiometabolic indices among adults with diabetes and depression. Design, Setting, and Participants: Parallel, open-label, pragmatic randomized clinical trial conducted at 4 socioeconomically diverse clinics in India that recruited patients with type 2 diabetes; a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score of at least 10 (range, 0-27); and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of at least 8%, systolic blood pressure (SBP) of at least 140 mm Hg, or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of at least 130 mg/dL. The first patient was enrolled on March 9, 2015, and the last was enrolled on May 31, 2016; the final follow-up visit was July 14, 2018. Interventions: Patients randomized to the intervention group (n = 196) received 12 months of self-management support from nonphysician care coordinators, decision support electronic health records facilitating physician treatment adjustments, and specialist case reviews; they were followed up for an additional 12 months without intervention. Patients in the control group (n = 208) received usual care over 24 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the between-group difference in the percentage of patients at 24 months who had at least a 50% reduction in Symptom Checklist Depression Scale (SCL-20) scores (range, 0-4; higher scores indicate worse symptoms) and a reduction of at least 0.5 percentage points in HbA1c, 5 mm Hg in SBP, or 10 mg/dL in LDL cholesterol. Prespecified secondary outcomes were percentage of patients at 12 and 24 months who met treatment targets (HbA1c <7.0%, SBP <130 mm Hg, LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dL [<70 mg/dL if prior cardiovascular disease]) or had improvements in individual outcomes (&#8805;50% reduction in SCL-20 score, &#8805;0.5-percentage point reduction in HbA1c, &#8805;5-mm Hg reduction in SBP, &#8805;10-mg/dL reduction in LDL cholesterol); percentage of patients who met all HbA1c, SBP, and LDL cholesterol targets; and mean reductions in SCL-20 score, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score, HbA1c, SBP, and LDL cholesterol. Results: Among 404 patients randomized (mean [SD] age, 53 [8.6] years; 165 [40.8%] men), 378 (93.5%) completed the trial. A significantly greater percentage of patients in the intervention group vs the usual care group met the primary outcome (71.6% vs 57.4%; risk difference, 16.9% [95% CI, 8.5%-25.2%]). Of 16 prespecified secondary outcomes, there were no statistically significant between-group differences in improvements in 10 outcomes at 12 months and in 13 outcomes at 24 months. Serious adverse events in the intervention and usual care groups included cardiovascular events or hospitalizations (4 [2.0%] vs 7 [3.4%]), stroke (0 vs 3 [1.4%]), death (2 [1.0%] vs 7 [3.4%]), and severe hypoglycemia (8 [4.1%] vs 0). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with diabetes and depression in India, a 12-month collaborative care intervention, compared with usual care, resulted in statistically significant improvements in a composite measure of depressive symptoms and cardiometabolic indices at 24 months. Further research is needed to understand the generalizability of the findings to other low- and middle-income health care settings.

There is still uncertainty around the significance and long-term consequence of these symptoms. There are also many outstanding questions on whether the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) can directly infect the central nervous system (CNS). Given the long association between viral infections with neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD), it seems timely to review this literature again in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and to glean some useful information from studies on similar viruses. In this commentary, we will consider the current knowledge on viral infections in the brain. In addition, we review the link between viral infection and neurodegeneration in PD, and review the recent literature on SARS infections, the potential link with PD and the potential areas of study in the future.","Dowd, E.; McKernan, D.

METHODS: We included patients admitted to emergency department with COVID-19 and available concentrations of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Patients were classified for each biomarker into two groups (low vs. high concentrations) according to their best cut-off point, and 30-day all-cause death was evaluated. RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, cTnI &#8805;21 ng/L, D-dimer &#8805;1112 ng/mL, CRP &#8805;10 mg/dL and LDH &#8805;334 U/L at admission were associated with an increased risk of 30-day all-cause death (hazard ratio (HR) 4.30; 95% CI 1.74-10.58; p = 0.002; HR 3.35; 95% CI 1.58-7.13; p = 0.002; HR 2.25; 95% CI 1.13-4.50; p = 0.021; HR 2.00; 95% CI 1.04-3.84; p = 0.039, respectively). The area under the curve for cTnI was 0.825 (95% CI 0.759-0.892) and, in comparison, was significantly better than CRP (0.685; 95% CI 0.600-0.770; p = 0.009) and LDH (0.643; 95% CI 0.534-0.753; p = 0.006) but non-significantly better than D-dimer (0.756; 95% CI 0.674-0.837; p = 0.115). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19, increased concentrations of cTnI, D-dimer, CRP and LDH are associated with short-term mortality. Of these, cTnI provides better mortality risk prediction. However, differences with D-dimer were non-significant.","Peiró, Óscar M; Carrasquer, Anna; Sánchez-Gimenez, Raúl; Lal-Trehan, Nisha; Del-Moral-Ronda, Víctor; Bonet, Gil; Fort-Gallifa, Isabel; Picó-Plana, Ester; Bastón-Paz, Natalia; Gutiérrez, Cristina; Bardaji, Alfredo",Biomarkers,,672

Apart from the virus survival outside the host, the latent infection transmissions caused by asymptomatic and presymptomatic hosts represent major challenges for controlling the epidemics. In this regard, social mixing and various biological factors play their subtle, but often critical, role. For example, a life-threatening condition may result in the infection contracted from an asymptomatic virus carrier. Here, we use a new recently developed microscopic agent-based modelling framework to shed light on the role of asymptomatic hosts and unravel the interplay between the biological and social factors of these nonlinear stochastic processes at high temporal resolution. The model accounts for each human actor's susceptibility and the virus survival time, as well as traceability along the infection path. These properties enable an efficient dissection of the infection events caused by asymptomatic carriers from those which involve symptomatic hosts before they develop symptoms and become removed to a controlled environment. Consequently, we assess how their relative proportions in the overall infection curve vary with changing model parameters. Our results reveal that these proportions largely depend on biological factors in the process, specifically, the virus transmissibility and the critical threshold for developing symptoms, which can be affected by the virus pathogenicity. Meanwhile, social participation activity is crucial for the overall infection level, further modulated by the virus transmissibility.","Tadic, Bosiljka; Melnik, Roderick",Comput Biol Med,,672

In the infectious context, exploring the innate and adaptive immune responses will help to investigate their contribution to viral control or toxicity. After vaccination, immunomonitoring of the correlate(s) and surrogate(s) of protection is a major asset for measuring vaccine immune efficacy. Conventional immunomonitoring methods include antibody-based technologies that are easy to use. However, promising sensitive high-throughput technologies allowed the emergence of holistic approaches. This raises the question of data integration methods and tools. These approaches allow us to increase our knowledge on immune mechanisms as well as the identification of key effectors of the immune response. However, the depiction of relevant findings requires a well-rounded consideration beforehand about the hypotheses, conception, organization and objectives of the immunomonitoring. Therefore, well-standardized and comprehensive studies fuel insight to design more efficient, rationale-based vaccines and therapeutics to fight against infectious diseases.

This study aimed to analyze the characteristics of asymptomatic carriers with COVID-19 to control the spread of the virus. We retrospectively investigated the clinical characteristics of 648 consecutive subjects who were enrolled in the study and were divided into asymptomatic carriers, mild cases, ordinary cases, severe or critical cases, and evaluated their impact on disease severity by means of Spearman correlation and multiple regression analyses. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted to determine the optimum cutoff levels of laboratory findings for diagnostic predictors of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19. In our study, a total of 648 subjects on admission with a mean age of 45.61 y including 345 males and 303 females were enrolled in our study. The leukocyte, lymphocyte, eosinophil, platelet, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, CD3+, CD4+, and CD8 + T lymphocyte levels, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate differed significantly among the groups (all p &#8804; 0.05). Disease severity was negatively associated with the CD3+ (r = -0.340; p < 0.001), CD4+ (r = -0.290; p = 0.001) and CD8+ (r = -0.322; p < 0.001) T lymphocyte levels. The significant diagnostic predictors of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 included the blood cell, cytokine, and T lymphocyte subset levels. Inflammation and immune response may play important roles in disease progression.

Some measures such as excessive use of disinfectants, increased production of nonbiodegradable waste, and water pollution will be the consequences of fighting against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which harms the environment. Due to the fact that these effects will be identified in the long term, they may be neglected in the current situation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the environmental challenges caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic crisis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a review study conducted by search in databases, including Scopus, PubMed, and science direct until early May 2020. Keywords included ""SARS-CoV-2,"" ""COVID-19,"" and ""Environment."" Studies published in English and conducted in different countries were also selected for the analysis. The guidelines published by reputable organizations such as the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control prevention (CDC), and the Ministry of Health have also been used in this study. CONCLUSION: The results of this study have shown that the COVID-19 virus, in addition to human damage and mortality, also affects the environment, and the damages and losses resulting from this pandemic may be identified later. Water pollution, increasing chemical pollution in the air, and increasing the production of nonbiodegradable waste are of these issues. For this purpose, it is recommended that, in addition to trying to improve the control of this pandemic, other environmental aspects in disinfection methods and disposal of dry and wet contaminated waste should be done more accurately and based on standard protocols. Infectious waste, in addition to the problem of standard sanitation, will become a major challenge that pollutes the environment. Based on this, it can be said that if home quarantine is observed voluntarily, in addition to reducing the risk of the SARS-CoV-2 and reducing the volume of visits to medical centers, it can be associated with another positive achievement, which is the reduction in waste production and protection of the environment.","Poursadeqiyan, Mohsen; Bazrafshan, Edris; Arefi, Maryam Feiz",J Educ Health Promot,,672

Here, we explore trends in words and phrases related to mental health through a collection of 1- , 2-, and 3-grams parsed from a data stream of roughly 10% of all English tweets since 2012. We examine temporal dynamics of mental health language, finding that the popularity of the phrase 'mental health' increased by nearly two orders of magnitude between 2012 and 2018. We observe that mentions of 'mental health' spike annually and reliably due to mental health awareness campaigns, as well as unpredictably in response to mass shootings, celebrities dying by suicide, and popular fictional stories portraying suicide. We find that the level of positivity of messages containing 'mental health', while stable through the growth period, has declined recently. Finally, we use the ratio of original tweets to retweets to quantify the fraction of appearances of mental health language due to social amplification. Since 2015, mentions of mental health have become increasingly due to retweets, suggesting that stigma associated with discussion of mental health on Twitter has diminished with time.","Stupinski, Anne Marie; Alshaabi, Thayer; Arnold, Michael V.; Adams, Jane Lydia; Minot, Joshua R.; Price, Matthew; Dodds, Peter Sheridan; Danforth, Christopher M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01481v1.pdf,672

The five most frequent investigational categories were immune modulating drugs (266 trials (20%)), unconventional medicine (167 trials (13%)), antimalarial drugs (118 trials (9%)), antiviral drugs (100 trials (8%)) and respiratory adjuncts (78 trials (6%)). The five most frequently tested uni-modal interventions were: chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (113 trials with 199,841 participants); convalescent plasma (64 trials with 11,840 participants); stem cells (51 trials with 3,370 participants); tocilizumab (19 trials with 4,139 participants) and favipiravir (19 trials with 3,210 participants). CONCLUSION: An extraordinary number of randomized clinical trials investigating COVID-19 management have been initiated with a multitude of medical preventive, adjunctive and treatment modalities. Blinding will be used in only 47% of trials, which may have influence on future reported treatment effects. Fifty-seven percent of all trials will assess mortality as an outcome facilitating future meta-analyses.","Karlsen, Anders Peder Højer; Wiberg, Sebastian; Laigaard, Jens; Pedersen, Casper; Rokamp, Kim Zillo; Mathiesen, Ole",PLoS One,,672

Current data indicates that viral RNA levels in maternal blood are low and there is no evidence of placental infection with SARS-CoV-2. Published reports to date suggest that perinatal transmission of SARSCoV- 2 can occur but is rare. Among 179 newborns tested for SARS-CoV2 at birth from mothers with COVID-19, transmission was suspected in 8 cases, 5 with positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and 3 with SARS-CoV-2 IgM. However, these cases arise from maternal infection close to childbirth and there are no information about exposition during first or second trimester of pregnancy. Welldesigned prospective cohort studies with rigorous judgement criteria are needed to determine the incidence and risk factors for perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Egloff, Charles; Vauloup-Fellous, Christelle; Picone, Olivier; Mandelbrot, Laurent; Roques, Pierre",J Clin Virol,,672

Conhecer todos os processos e atividades desenvolvidas nessas unidades e adotar bons indicadores para avaliar o desempenho, facilitam o controle interno do laboratório. O uso combinado dos indicadores com as ferramentas de gestão como Gestão da Qualidade Total, Redesenho de Processos, Normas ISO, Pensamento Lean e Gestão do Erro, poderão propiciar uma melhora significativa na eficiência. Esse trabalho de Engenharia Biomédica, com linha de pesquisa em Engenharia Clínica e Gestão, tem como objetivo selecionar e avaliar indicadores que facilitem o controle interno de laboratórios e provoquem seu uso pelos tomadores de decisão e todos da Engenharia Clínica. O controle interno permite detectar desvios e realizar correções no desempenho das rotinas, prestando assim um serviço com confiabilidade nos resultados das pesquisas e laudo de testes e exames. A metodologia constou em selecionar um conjunto de indicadores a partir das rotinas utilizadas em laboratório clínico, por dispor de maior experiência e publicações na área de gestão. Este conjunto de indicadores foi aplicado em dois perfis de laboratórios: em um estrato, laboratórios que influenciam diretamente a saúde e em outro estrato, laboratórios que, o resultado de suas pesquisas possa alterar o meio ambiente e, dessa forma, impactar indiretamente a saúde humana. Sustentado em trabalhos da literatura especializada de autores conceituados, selecionou-se 30 indicadores contemplando uma Avaliação Prévia e as categorias de Indicadores de Liderança, de Responsabilidade Pública, de Planejamento Estratégico, de Operacionalização Estratégica e dos Grupos de Usuários. Os indicadores buscaram explorar a rotina das atividades e o envolvimento dos participantes e usuários na gestão de laboratórios universitários de Odontologia, Nutrição e Farmacologia (laboratórios com influência direta sobre a saúde) e laboratórios universitários de Veterinária, Agronomia e Zootecnia (laboratórios com influência indireta sobre a saúde). Para cada Indicador foram delineadas três opções de respostas que permitisse analisar a existência da prática, da rotina, sua intensidade e a visão do participante quanto à administração da unidade laboratorial. Os resultados foram analisados comparativa e proporcionalmente em três abordagens. Na primeira análise, cada opção de resposta de cada indicador foi comparada entre todos os laboratórios. Na segunda análise, cada opção de resposta de cada indicador foi comparada entre os dois estratos. E na terceira análise, foi comparado o percentual de cada opção entre todas as respostas. Estabelecido o limite de tolerância, pode-se identificar: os indicadores que atendem a expectativa, a qual estrato pertence e em que proporção. Da mesma forma pode-se identificar os indicadores com maior comprometimento na gestão e de quantos participantes espera-se o não atendimento do indicador. Com a metodologia proposta foi possível visualizar a realidade da unidade laboratorial, verificar a flexibilidade em estabelecer o limite de aceitação por prioridades e perceber que com o uso das ferramentas de gestão é possível, com pequenas intervenções, esperar grandes resultados.","CONTI, DENISE DE",,,672

We consider the asymmetric effects of fiscal policy instruments on environmental quality for the top ten Asian carbon emitters over the period 1981-2018. We go beyond the literature and claim that the effects could be asymmetric. More specifically, we found that a positive shock in government expenditure will worsen environmental quality in Malaysia, UAE, Thailand, Indonesia, Turkey, Iran, India, and China, and improve it in Japan. On the other hand, we found that cutting government expenditure will improve environmental quality in these economies and will worsen only in Japan. Moreover, a higher government income tax revenue uniquely increases the government's spending that increases the carbon emissions in Malaysia, UAE, Thailand, Indonesia, Turkey, Iran, India, and China, and decrease in Japan. The negative shock of government revenue has adverse results on carbon emissions in these economies. However, short-run asymmetric effects translate to long-run effects in most Asian economies.","Ullah, Sana; Majeed, Muhammad Tariq; Chishti, Muhammad Zubair",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,672

Due to the absence of specific treatment, the only way to control a pandemic is by stopping its spread. Early identification of affected persons is urgently in demand. Diagnostic methods applied in hospitals are time-consuming, which delay the identification of positive patients. This study aims to develop machine learning-based diagnosis model which can predict positive cases and helps in decision-making. Design/methodology/approach In this research, the authors have developed a diagnosis model to check coronavirus positivity based on an artificial neural network. The authors have trained the model with clinically assessed symptoms, patient-reported symptoms, other medical histories and exposure data of the person. The authors have explored filter-based feature selection methods such as Chi2, ANOVA F-score and Mutual Information for improving performance of a classification model. Metrics used to evaluate performance of the model are accuracy, precision, sensitivity and F1-score. Findings The authors got highest classification performance with model trained with features ranked according to ANOVA FS method. Highest scores for accuracy, sensitivity, precision and F1-score of predictions are 0.93, 0.99, 0.94 and 0.93, respectively. The study reveals that most relevant predictors for COVID-19 diagnosis are sob severity, cough severity, sob presence, cough presence, fatigue and number of days since symptom onset. Originality/value Treatment for COVID-19 is not available to date. The best way to control this pandemic is the isolation of positive persons. It is very much necessary to identify positive persons at an early stage. RT-PCR test used to check COVID-19 positivity is the time-consuming, expensive and laborious method. Current diagnosis methods used in hospital demand more medical resources with increasing cases of coronavirus that introduce shortage of resources. The developed model provides solution to the problem cheaper and faster decreases the immediate need for medical resources and helps in decision-making.","Chauhan, H.; Modi, K.; Shrivastava, S.",World Journal of Engineering,,672

416924,5-3 Simultaneous and Interactive Distance Learning Experimented at Hiroshima University School of Medicine,2020,"BACKGROUND: As the Coronavirus pandemic continues to spread across the globe, the world continues in its search for a medication to cure, or attenuate, the symptoms of COVID-19. It would be desirable, and fortuitous, to identify such a medication that is already in use for another condition, and whose side effect profile and safety data are already known and approved. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the current study was to evaluate the influence of medication on typical COVID-19 symptoms, using data from an online surveillance survey in Germany. METHODS: Between early April and late July 2020, 3990 people in Lower Saxony, Germany, participated in an online symptom tracker application, '""covid-nein-danke.de"". The questionnaire contained items on typical COVID-19 symptoms, age range, gender, work in patient-facing healthcare, community life, postal code, previous illnesses, permanent medication, vaccination status, and results of PCR and antibody testing for COVID-19, and COVID-19 treatment if performed. RESULTS: Analysis of the data demonstrated a statistically significant inverse relationship between self-reported typical COVID-19 symptoms and self-reported statin therapy and, to a lesser extent, antihypertensive therapy. Defining COVID-19 by restrictive symptom criteria (4 out of 7 symptoms) or a positive PCR-test the association was found solely for statins with a statistically significance (OR 0.28 (0.1 - 0.78)). CONCLUSIONS: People taking statin medication may be more likely to have an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, in which case they may be at an increased risk of transmitting it unknowingly. The results of this study should be incorporated into 'symptoms-based' surveillance and decision-making protocols in respect to COVID-19. Whether statin therapy has a beneficial effect in combating COVID-19 cannot be deduced from the data and should be investigated by further study.

An underlying immunological mechanism similar to that of spontaneous heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is suspected, with the identification of antibodies to platelet factor-4 (PF4), but without previous heparin exposure. This unusual mechanism has significant implications for the management approach used, which differs from usual treatment of CVST. We describe the cases of two young males, who developed severe thrombocytopenia and fatal CVST following the first dose of Vaxzevria. Both presented with a headache, with subsequent rapid neurological deterioration. One patient underwent PF4 antibody testing, which was positive. A rapid vaccination programme is essential in helping to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, it is vital that such COVID-19 vaccine-associated events, which at this stage appear to be very rare, are viewed through this lens. However, some cases have proved fatal. It is critical that clinicians are alerted to the emergence of such events to facilitate appropriate management. Patients presenting with CVST features and thrombocytopenia post-vaccination should undergo PF4 antibody testing and be managed in a similar fashion to HIT, in particular avoiding heparin and platelet transfusions.","Mehta, Puja R; Apap Mangion, Sean; Benger, Matthew; Stanton, Biba R; Czuprynska, Julia; Arya, Roopen; Sztriha, Laszlo K",Brain Behav Immun,,672
420977,Using basketball as a medium for group work to address social inequality during the pandemic,2021,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as its common causes (e.g., diabetes and obesity), are recognized risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness. To explore whether the most common inherited cause of CKD, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), is also an independent risk factor, we studied data from the VA health system and the VA COVID-19-shared resources (e.g., ICD codes, demographics, pre-existing conditions, pre-testing symptoms, and post-testing outcomes). Among 61 COVID-19-positive ADPKD patients, 21 (34.4%) were hospitalized, 10 (16.4%) were admitted to ICU, 4 (6.6%) required ventilator, and 4 (6.6%) died by August 18, 2020. These rates were comparable to patients with other cystic kidney diseases and cystic liver-only diseases. ADPKD was not a significant risk factor for any of the four outcomes in multivariable logistic regression analyses when compared with other cystic kidney diseases and cystic liver-only diseases. In contrast, diabetes was a significant risk factor for hospitalization [OR 2.30 (1.61, 3.30), p<0.001], ICU admission [OR 2.23 (1.47, 3.42), p<0.001], and ventilator requirement [OR 2.20 (1.27, 3.88), p=0.005]. Black race significantly increased the risk for ventilator requirement [OR 2.00 (1.18, 3.44), p=0.011] and mortality [OR 1.60 (1.02, 2.51), p=0.040]. We also examined the outcome of starting dialysis after COVID-19 confirmation. The main risk factor for starting dialysis was CKD [OR 6.37 (2.43, 16.7)] and Black race [OR 3.47 (1.48, 8.1)]. After controlling for CKD, ADPKD did not significantly increase the risk for newly starting dialysis comparing with other cystic kidney diseases and cystic liver-only diseases. In summary, ADPKD did not significantly alter major COVID-19 outcomes among veterans when compared to other cystic kidney and liver patients.","Cui, Xiangqin; Gallini, Julia W; Jasien, Christine L; Mrug, Michal",,,672

Whole blood stimulation assays with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes (HKLM), Aspergillus fumigatus, and Candida albicans were used to mimic secondary infections, and changes in immune phenotype and cytokine release were assessed. COVID-19 patients displayed an immune phenotype characterized by increased HLA-DR+CD38+ and PD-1+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and elevated CD8+CD244+ lymphocytes, compared to healthy controls. Monocyte activation markers and cytokines IL-6, IL-8, TNF, IL-10, and sIL2R&#945; were elevated, corresponding to monocyte activation syndrome, while IL-1ß levels were low. LPS, HKLM and Aspergillus fumigatus antigen stimulation provoked an immune response that did not differ between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, while COVID-19 patients showed an attenuated monocyte CD80 upregulation and abrogated release of IL-6, TNF, IL-1&#945;, and IL-1ß toward Candida albicans. This study adds further detail to the characterization of the immune response in critically ill COVID-19 patients and hints at an increased susceptibility for Candida albicans infection.","Moser, Dominique; Biere, Katharina; Han, Bing; Hoerl, Marion; Schelling, Gustav; Choukér, Alexander; Woehrle, Tobias",Front Immunol,,672
425629,"COVID-19: Lessons in laboratory medicine, pathology, and autopsy",2020,"The complexity associated with an epidemic defies any quantitatively reliable predictive theoretical scheme. Here, we pursue a generalized mathematical model and cellular automata simulations to study the dynamics of infectious diseases and apply it in the context of the COVID-19 spread. Our model is inspired by the theory of coupled chemical reactions to treat multiple parallel reaction pathways. We essentially ask the question: how hard could the time evolution toward the desired herd immunity (HI) be on the lives of people? We demonstrate that the answer to this question requires the study of two implicit functions, which are determined by several rate constants, which are time-dependent themselves. Implementation of different strategies to counter the spread of the disease requires a certain degree of a quantitative understanding of the time-dependence of the outcome. Here, we compartmentalize the susceptible population into two categories, (i) vulnerables and (ii) resilients (including asymptomatic carriers), and study the dynamical evolution of the disease progression. We obtain the relative fatality of these two sub-categories as a function of the percentages of the vulnerable and resilient population and the complex dependence on the rate of attainment of herd immunity. We attempt to study and quantify possible adverse effects of the progression rate of the epidemic on the recovery rates of vulnerables, in the course of attaining HI. We find the important result that slower attainment of the HI is relatively less fatal. However, slower progress toward HI could be complicated by many intervening factors.","Mondal, Sayantan; Mukherjee, Saumyak; Bagchi, Biman",J Chem Phys,,672

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, while there has been proliferation of increasingly complex models, still the most basic models have provided the core framework for our thinking and interpreting policy decisions. Here, classic results are presented that give insights into both the role of transmission-reducing interventions (such as social distancing) in controlling an emerging epidemic, and also what would happen if insufficient control is applied. Though these are simple results from the most basic of epidemic models, they give valuable benchmarks for comparison with the outputs of more complex modelling approaches.

This disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly worldwide, and on March 2020 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Today, over 21 million people have been infected, with more than 750.000 casualties. Today, no vaccine or antiviral drug is available. While the development of a vaccine might take at least a year, and for a novel drug, even longer; finding a new use to an old drug (drug repurposing) could be the most effective strategy. We present a docking-based screening using a quantum mechanical scoring of a library built from approved drugs and compounds undergoing clinical trials, against three SARS-CoV-2 target proteins: the spike or S-protein, and two proteases, the main protease and the papain-like protease. The S-protein binds directly to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 receptor of the human host cell surface, while the two proteases process viral polyproteins. Following the analysis of our structure-based compound screening, we propose several structurally diverse compounds (either FDA-approved or in clinical trials) that could display antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Clearly, these compounds should be further evaluated in experimental assays and clinical trials to confirm their actual activity against the disease. We hope that these findings may contribute to the rational drug design against COVID-19.","Cavasotto, Claudio N; Di Filippo, Juan I",Mol. inform. (Internet),,672

Which lessons should we learn from SARS and Ebola epidemics for the current CoViD-19 pandemics?],2020,"OBJECTIVE: There has been an unprecedented rise in infant mortality associated with deprivation in recent years in the United Kingdom (UK) and Republic of Ireland. A healthy pregnancy can have significant impacts on the life chances of children. The objective of this review was to understand the association between individual-level and household-level measures of socioeconomic status and adverse pregnancy outcomes. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Nine databases were searched (Medline, Embase, Scopus, ASSIA, CINAHL, PsycINFO, BNI, MIDRIS and Google Scholar) for articles published between 1999 and August 2019. Grey literature searches were also assessed. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies reporting associations between individual-level or household socioeconomic factors on pregnancy outcomes in the UK or Ireland. RESULTS: Among the 82 353 search results, 53 821 titles were identified and 35 unique studies met the eligibility criteria. Outcomes reported were neonatal, perinatal and maternal mortality, preterm birth, birth weight and mode of delivery. Pooled effect sizes were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. There were significantly increased odds of women from lower levels of occupation/social classes compared with the highest level having stillbirth (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.59, I2 98.62%), neonatal mortality (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.57, I2 97.09%), perinatal mortality (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.57, I2 98.69%), preterm birth (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.50, I2 70.97%) and low birth weight (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.61, I2 99.85%). Limitations relate to available data, unmeasured confounders and the small number of studies for some outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified consistent evidence that lower occupational status, especially manual occupations and unemployment, were significantly associated with increased risk of multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes. Strategies to improve pregnancy outcomes should incorporate approaches that address wider determinants of health to provide women and families with the best chances of having a healthy pregnancy and baby and to decrease pregnancy-related health inequalities in the general population.

In this paper, we first reviewed the antioxidant and antiviral potential of the active metabolites that exist in the three known macro-algae classes;Phaeophyceae, Rhodophyceae, and Chlorophyceae, and a comparison between their activities is discussed. Secondly, a review of conventional and non-conventional extraction methods is undertaken. The review then focused on identifying the optimal extraction method of sulphated polysaccharide from macro-algae that exhibits both antiviral and antioxidant activity. The review finds that species belonging to the Phaeophyceae and Rhodophceae classes are primarily potent against herpes simplex virus, followed by human immunodeficiency virus and influenza virus. At the same time, species belonging to Chlorophyceae class are recorded by most of the scholars to have antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus 1. Additionally, all three macro-algae classes exhibit antioxidant activity, the potency of which is a factor of the molecular structure of the bioactive metabolite as well as the extraction method applied.","El-Shafei, Rasha Hegazy Hala Acharya Bishnu",Energies,,672
428541,Practical guidelines to build Sense of Community in online medical education,2021,"Mediation analysis draws increasing attention in many scientific areas such as genomics, epidemiology and finance. In this paper, we propose new statistical inference procedures for high dimensional mediation models, in which both the outcome model and the mediator model are linear with high dimensional mediators. Traditional procedures for mediation analysis cannot be used to make statistical inference for high dimensional linear mediation models due to high-dimensionality of the mediators. We propose an estimation procedure for the indirect effects of the models via a partial penalized least squares method, and further establish its theoretical properties. We further develop a partial penalized Wald test on the indirect effects, and prove that the proposed test has a $\chi^2$ limiting null distribution. We also propose an $F$-type test for direct effects and show that the proposed test asymptotically follows a $\chi^2$-distribution under null hypothesis and a noncentral $\chi^2$-distribution under local alternatives. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed tests and compare their performance with existing ones. We further apply the newly proposed statistical inference procedures to study stock reaction to COVID-19 pandemic via an empirical analysis of studying the mediation effects of financial metrics that bridge company's sector and stock return.","Guo, Xu; Li, Runze; Liu, Jingyuan; Zeng, Mudong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12329v1.pdf,672

429749,COVID-19 y el problema de los tiempos en las estrategias de control/ COVID-19 and the problem of the times in the control strategies,2020,"The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) now is considered a global public health emergency. One of the unprecedented challenges is defining the optimal therapy for those patients with severe pneumonia and systemic manifestations of COVID-19. The optimal therapy should be largely based on the pathogenesis of infections caused by this novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the onset of COVID-19, there have been many prepublications and publications reviewing the therapy of COVID-19 as well as many prepublications and publications reviewing the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. However, there have been no comprehensive reviews that link COVID-19 therapies to the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. To link COVID-19 therapies to pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, we performed a comprehensive search through MEDLINE, PubMed, medRxiv, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science using the following keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, novel 2019 coronavirus, pathology, pathologic, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, coronavirus pneumonia, coronavirus infection, coronavirus pulmonary infection, coronavirus cardiovascular infection, coronavirus gastroenteritis, coronavirus autopsy findings, viral sepsis, endotheliitis, thrombosis, coagulation abnormalities, immunology, humeral immunity, cellular immunity, inflammation, cytokine storm, superantigen, therapy, treatment, therapeutics, immune-based therapeutics, antiviral agents, respiratory therapy, oxygen therapy, anticoagulation therapy, adjuvant therapy, and preventative therapy. Opinions expressed in this review also are based on personal experience as clinicians, authors, peer reviewers, and editors. This narrative review linking COVID-19 therapies with pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in six major therapeutic goals for COVID-19 therapy based on the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. These goals are listed below: 1. The first goal is identifying COVID-19 patients that require both testing and therapy. This is best accomplished with a COVID-19 molecular test from symptomatic patients as well as determining the oxygen saturation in such patients with a pulse oximeter. Whether a symptomatic respiratory illness is COVID-19, influenza, or another respiratory pathogen, an oxygen saturation less than 90% means that the patient requires medical assistance. 2. The second goal is to correct the hypoxia. This goal generally requires hospitalization for oxygen therapy; other respiratory-directed therapies such as prone positioning or mechanical ventilation are often used in the attempt to correct hypoxemia due to COVID-19. 3. The third goal is to reduce the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. Ideally, there would be an oral antiviral agent available such as seen with the use of oseltamivir phosphate for influenza. This oral antiviral agent should be taken early in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such an oral agent is not available yet. Currently, two options are available for reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. These are post-Covid-19 plasma with a high neutralizing antibody titer against SARS-CoV-2 or intravenous remdesivir; both options require hospitalization. 4. The fourth goal is to identify and address the hyperinflammation phase often seen in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Currently, fever with an elevated C-reactive protein is useful for diagnosing this hyperinflammation syndrome. Low-dose dexamethasone therapy currently is the best therapeutic approach. 5. The fifth goal is to identify and address the hypercoagulability phase seen in many hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients who would benefit from anticoagulation therapy can be identified by a marked increase in d-dimer and prothrombin time with a decrease in fibrinogen. To correct this disseminated intravascular coagulation-like phase, anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin is preferred. Anticoagulation therapy with unfractionated heparin is preferred in COVID-19 patients with acute kidney injuries. 6. The last goal is prophylaxis for persons who are not yet infected. Potential supplements include vitamin D and zinc. Although the data for such supplements is not extremely strong, it can be argued that almost 50% of the population worldwide has a vitamin D deficiency. Correcting this deficiency would be beneficial regardless of any impact of COVID-19. Similarly, zinc is an important supplement that is important in one's diet regardless of any effect on SARS-CoV-2. As emerging therapies are found to be more effective against the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic mechanisms identified, they can be substituted for those therapies presented in this review.","Stratton, Charles W; Tang, Yi-Wei; Lu, Hongzhou",J. med. virol,,672

METHODS: A mass test campaign was performed on May 13, 2020, using antibody-detection rapid tests for asymptomatic inmates and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for those who were symptomatic. Those with negative results were retested on June 16. Inmates were interviewed to characterise background health conditions and the presence of symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 159 inmates were evaluated. In the first mass testing, 79.9% (127/159) of inmates had been infected, of whom 53.5% (68/127) reported symptoms. In the second testing round, 17 new cases were identified, increasing the total to 90.6% (144/159) of inmates with a positive result. Comorbidities were present in 67.3% of inmates; 2 hospitalisations and no COVID-related deaths were recorded. CONCLUSION: More than 90% of inmates aged >60 years were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the outbreak. Periodic health monitoring, active case finding and early care for symptomatic patients contributed to positive post-infection outcomes. Such measures must be considered essential for the surveillance of COVID-19 in environments with limited capacity to promote social distance, such as penitentiary institutions.","Gouvea-Reis, Fernando A; Borja, Lairton S; Dias, Patrícia O; Silva, Danniely C S; Percio, Jadher; Peterka, Cássio; Silva, Guilherme O; Adjuto, Raphael N P; Tavares, Glaucia B; Cunha, Mayana B; Feres, Claudia; de Oliveira, Janaína; Sodré, Giselle; Dos Santos, Wallace; de Moraes, Camile",Int. j. infect. dis,,672

METHODS: Consecutive CIRD patients reporting to our specialised centre were prospectively included (n=975) in this cross-sectional study. Data on comorbidities including infections, treatment, vaccination status, screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and hepatitis B (HepB) were collected. Antibodies against measles and HepB were measured by ELISA. The vaccination status was assessed by a predefined vaccination score (0-26) categorising patients into four immunisation states: low (0-6), moderate (7-13), good (14-20), high (21-26). RESULTS: All patients on bDMARDs (n=499) were screened for LTBI, and 469 for HepB (94%). All LTBI patients (n=16) received isoniazid (3.2%) and 16 chronic HepB patients received lamivudine (3.4%). Protective measles specific IgG-antibodies were found in 901 patients (92.4%). Although 629 patients were educated about vaccination strategies (64.5%), only 540 showed a vaccination card (55.4%). Only 49% of patients had undergone pneumococcal vaccination and less than 30% were protected against HepB and influenza, while 7.6% have not protective antibody titres against measles. No patient met the German national vaccination recommendations requiring a complete documentation of vaccines. The mean vaccination score was 13.3±4.2 with 5.7% of patients having a low, 43.9% a moderate, 47.0% a good and 3.3% a high score. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of CIRD patients are n0t sufficiently vaccinated against pneumococci, HepB, influenza and measles. Although CIRD patients and general practitioners regularly receive professional information about the need of vaccination, vaccination rates were low to moderate. Interdisciplinary quality projects should be planned to change that inacceptable result.","Kiltz, Uta; Celik, Aylin; Tsiami, Styliani; Buehring, Bjoern; Baraliakos, Xenofon; Andreica, Ioana; Kiefer, David; Braun, Juergen",,,672

To reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), public health officials recommend against touching one's face, as the virus is transmitted through mucous membranes in the mouth, nose and eyes. Students, office workers, medical personnel and people on trains were found to touch their faces between 9 and 23 times per hour. This paper introduces FaceGuard, a system that utilizes deep learning to predict hand movements that result in touching the face, and provides sensory feedback to stop the user from touching the face. The system utilizes an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to obtain features that characterize hand movement involving face touching. Time-series data can be efficiently classified using 1D-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with minimal feature engineering;1D-CNN filters automatically extract temporal features in IMU data. Thus, a 1D-CNN based prediction model is developed and trained with data from 4,800 trials recorded from 40 participants. Training data are collected for hand movements involving face touching during various everyday activities such as sitting, standing, or walking. Results showed that while the average time needed to touch the face is 1,200 ms, a prediction accuracy of more than 92% is achieved with less than 550 ms of IMU data. As for the sensory response, the paper presents a psychophysical experiment to compare the response time for three sensory feedback modalities, namely visual, auditory, and vibrotactile. Results demonstrate that the response time is significantly smaller for vibrotactile feedback (427.3 ms) compared to visual (561.70 ms) and auditory (520.97 ms). Furthermore, the success rate (to avoid face touching) is also statistically higher for vibrotactile and auditory feedback compared to visual feedback. These results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting a hand movement and providing timely sensory feedback within less than a second in order to avoid face touching.","Michelin, A.

We recorded presenting characteristics and outcomes (death or organ support) up to 30 days. We categorised patients as early DNACPR (before or on the day of admission) or late/no DNACPR (no DNACPR or occurring after the day of admission). We undertook descriptive analysis comparing these groups and multivariable analysis to identify independent predictors of early DNACPR. RESULTS: We excluded 1249 with missing DNACPR data, and identified 3929/12748 (31%) with an early DNACPR decision.

Angiografía con tomografía computarizada: resultados preliminares,2020,"BACKGROUND: Point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) is a promising pragmatic risk stratification tool in COVID-19. This study describes and compares LUS characteristics between patients with different clinical outcomes. METHODS: Prospective observational study of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 adults with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection in the emergency department (ED) of Lausanne University Hospital. A trained physician recorded LUS images using a standardized protocol. Two experts reviewed images blinded to patient outcome. We describe and compare early LUS findings (acquired within 24hours of presentation to the ED) between patient groups based on their outcome at 7 days after inclusion: 1) outpatients, 2) hospitalised and 3) intubated/death. Normalized LUS score was used to discriminate between groups. RESULTS: Between March 6 and April 3 2020, we included 80 patients (17 outpatients, 42 hospitalized and 21 intubated/dead). 73 patients (91%) had abnormal LUS (70% outpatients, 95% hospitalised and 100% intubated/death; p=0.003). The proportion of involved zones was lower in outpatients compared with other groups (median 30% [IQR 0-40%], 44% [31-70%] and 70% [50-88%], p<0.001). Predominant abnormal patterns were bilateral and multifocal spread thickening of the pleura with pleural line irregularities (70%), confluent B lines (60%) and pathologic B lines (50%). Posterior inferior zones were more often affected. Median normalized LUS score had a good level of discrimination between outpatients and others with area under the ROC of 0.80 (95% CI 0.68-0.92). CONCLUSIONS: Systematic LUS has potential as a reliable, cheap and easy-to-use triage tool for the early risk stratification in COVID-19 patients presenting in EDs.","Brahier, Thomas; Meuwly, Jean-Yves; Pantet, Olivier; Brochu Vez, Marie-Josée; Gerhard Donnet, Hélène; Hartley, Mary-Anne; Hugli, Olivier; Boillat-Blanco, Noémie",Clin. infect. dis,,672

Argumentum ad ignorantiam?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been mirrored by diffusion of misinformation and conspiracy theories about its origins (such as 5G cellular networks) and the motivations of preventive measures like vaccination, social distancing, and face masks (for example, as a political ploy). These beliefs have resulted in substantive, negative real-world outcomes but remain largely unstudied. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, online survey (n=660). Participants were asked about the believability of five selected COVID-19 narratives, their political orientation, their religious commitment, and their trust in science (a 21-item scale), along with sociodemographic items. Data were assessed descriptively, then latent profile analysis was used to identify subgroups with similar believability profiles. Bivariate (ANOVA) analyses were run, then multivariable, multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with membership in specific COVID-19 narrative believability profiles. RESULTS: For the full sample, believability of the narratives varied, from a low of 1.94 (SD=1.72) for the 5G narrative to a high of 5.56 (SD=1.64) for the zoonotic (scientific consensus) narrative. Four distinct belief profiles emerged, with the preponderance (70%) of the sample falling into Profile 1, which believed the scientifically accepted narrative (zoonotic origin) but not the misinformed or conspiratorial narratives. Other profiles did not disbelieve the zoonotic explanation, but rather believed additional misinformation to varying degrees. Controlling for sociodemographics, political orientation and religious commitment were marginally, and typically non-significantly, associated with COVID-19 belief profile membership. However, trust in science was a strong, significant predictor of profile membership, with lower trust being substantively associated with belonging to Profiles 2 through 4. CONCLUSIONS: Belief in misinformation or conspiratorial narratives may not be mutually exclusive from belief in the narrative reflecting scientific consensus; that is, profiles were distinguished not by belief in the zoonotic narrative, but rather by concomitant belief or disbelief in additional narratives. Additional, renewed dissemination of scientifically accepted narratives may not attenuate belief in misinformation. However, prophylaxis of COVID-19 misinformation might be achieved by taking concrete steps to improve trust in science and scientists, such as building understanding of the scientific process and supporting open science initiatives.","Agley, Jon; Xiao, Yunyu",BMC Public Health,,672

The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of concerns about contagion on negative affect (NA) according to resilience, gender and age by using a longitudinal methodology that evaluated the participants 4 months before the COVID-19 outbreak and during the resulting lockdown situation imposed by the Spanish government. About 102 participants from a community sample were assessed. The results revealed higher levels of NA during the lockdown, as well as a positive relationship between age and the increase in NA. In addition, we found that a positive relationship between contagion concern and increase in NA was only observed in women with low resilience.","Megías-Robles, Alberto; Gutiérrez-Cobo, María José; Cabello, Rosario; Gómez-Leal, Raquel; Fernández-Berrocal, Pablo",J Health Psychol,,672

Since its first emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 has swept through Asia and propagated throughout the world to Europe and North America. As of April 13, 1,773,084 people were infected and 111,652 people had died from COVID-19 globally, and new record levels of infection are being reported every day. Based on the data that have been amassed so far, the primary risk factors for a severe disease course or even mortality from COVID-19 are underlying diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. As the global prevalence of diabetes continues to increase, patients with endocrine diseases such as diabetes mellitus and those who are on long-term corticosteroid therapy due to adrenal insufficiency or hypopituitarism are at risk for a poor prognosis of COVID-19. As endocrinologists, we would like to briefly review the current knowledge about the relationship between COVID-19 and endocrine diseases and to discuss what we can do for the safety and health of our patients with endocrine diseases in this globally threatening situation.","Rhee, Eun Jung; Kim, Jung Hee; Moon, Sun Joon; Lee, Won Young",Endocrinol Metab (Seoul),,672

Here, we characterized polyclonal immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) and Fabs from COVID-19 convalescent individuals for recognition of coronavirus spikes. Plasma IgGs differed in their focus on RBD epitopes, recognition of alpha- and beta-coronaviruses, and contributions of avidity to increased binding/neutralization of IgGs over Fabs. Using electron microscopy, we examined specificities of polyclonal plasma Fabs, revealing recognition of both S1A and RBD epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 spike. Moreover, a 3.4 Å cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a neutralizing monoclonal Fab-spike complex revealed an epitope that blocks ACE2 receptor binding. Modeling based on these structures suggested different potentials for inter-spike crosslinking by IgGs on viruses, and characterized IgGs would not be affected by identified SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations. Overall, our studies structurally define a recurrent anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody class derived from VH3-53/VH3-66 and similarity to a SARS-CoV VH3-30 antibody, providing criteria for evaluating vaccine-elicited antibodies.","Barnes, Christopher O; West, Anthony P; Huey-Tubman, Kathryn E; Hoffmann, Magnus A G; Sharaf, Naima G; Hoffman, Pauline R; Koranda, Nicholas; Gristick, Harry B; Gaebler, Christian; Muecksch, Frauke; Lorenzi, Julio C Cetrulo; Finkin, Shlomo; Hägglöf, Thomas; Hurley, Arlene; Millard, Katrina G; Weisblum, Yiska; Schmidt, Fabian; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Bieniasz, Paul D; Caskey, Marina; Robbiani, Davide F; Nussenzweig, Michel C; Bjorkman, Pamela J",Cell,,672

These complex poles are known as resonances and provide the energies and inverse lifetimes of the system under study (e.g., molecules) in metastable states. This approach allows incorporating finite grid methods in the study of resonance phenomena in chemistry. Possible applications include the calculation of electronic autoionization resonances which occur when ionization takes place as the bond lengths of the molecule are varied. Alternatively, the method can be applied to calculate nuclear predissociation resonances which are associated with activated complexes with finite lifetimes.","Dann, Roie; Elbaz, Guy; Berkheim, Jonathan; Muhafra, Alan; Nitecki, Omri; Wilczynski, Daniel; Moiseyev, Nimrod",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04049v3.pdf,672

The research covers the period from the declaration of the state of emergency in March 2020 until the end of the year. The study aims to explore the implementation of the European Charter of Local Self-Government's special provisions related to local democracy concerns in times of crisis. The article analyses the relationship between the pandemic and governmental measures that affected the economic position of local self-governments. It does not provide an objective assessment, but rather presents and analyses the relevant resources. The article is primarily based on the review of the legal framework and the relevant Constitutional Court's decisions. The analysis demonstrates that the Constitutional Court did not or only partially defended the legal interests of local self-governments. The governmental measures 'stood the test of constitutionality'. The study confirms the initial assumption that the excessive centralization process was significantly reinforced, while the position of local self-governments in the state organs system weakened. However, some measures cause concern as they highlight deeper problems in the Hungarian legal system, irrespective of the pandemic.","Siket, J.",Central European Public Administration Review,,672

451084,"Older Adults, Social Technologies, and the Coronavirus Pandemic: Challenges, Strengths, and Strategies for Support",2020,"Importance: During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, there may be too few ventilators to meet medical demands. It is unknown how many US states have ventilator allocation guidelines and how these state guidelines compare with one another. Objective: To evaluate the number of publicly available US state guidelines for ventilator allocation and the variation in state recommendations for how ventilator allocation decisions should occur and to assess whether unique criteria exist for pediatric patients. Evidence Review: This systematic review evaluated publicly available guidelines about ventilator allocation for all states in the US and in the District of Columbia using department of health websites for each state and internet searches. Documents with any discussion of a process to triage mechanical ventilatory support during a public health emergency were screened for inclusion. Articles were excluded if they did not include specific ventilator allocation recommendations, were in draft status, did not include their state department of health, or were not the most up-to-date guideline. All documents were individually assessed and reassessed by 2 independent reviewers from March 30 to April 2 and May 8 to 10, 2020. Findings: As of May 10, 2020, 26 states had publicly available ventilator guidelines, and 14 states had pediatric guidelines. Use of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score in the initial rank of adult patients was recommended in 15 state guidelines (58%), and assessment of limited life expectancy from underlying conditions or comorbidities was included in 6 state guidelines (23%). Priority was recommended for specific groups in the initial evaluation of patients in 6 states (23%) (ie, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Utah). Many states recommended exclusion criteria in adult (11 of 26 states [42%]) and pediatric (10 of 14 states [71%]) ventilator allocation. Withdrawal of mechanical ventilation from a patient to give to another if a shortage occurs was discussed in 22 of 26 adult guidelines (85%) and 9 of 14 pediatric guidelines (64%). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that although allocation guidelines for mechanical ventilatory support are essential in a public health emergency, only 26 US states provided public guidance on how this allocation should occur. Guidelines among states, including adjacent states, varied significantly and could cause inequity in the allocation of mechanical ventilatory support during a public health emergency, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Piscitello, Gina M; Kapania, Esha M; Miller, William D; Rojas, Juan C; Siegler, Mark; Parker, William F",JAMA Netw Open,,672

The term vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) was coined to reflect this new phenomenon. In vitro experiments with VIPIT patient sera indicated that high dose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) competitively inhibit the platelet activating properties of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine induced antibodies. Here, we report a case of a 62-year-old woman, who had received this vaccine and developed VIPIT. She visited the emergency ward because of petechiae and hematomas. In the laboratory work-up, thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen, elevated D-dimer, and positivity in the platelet factor 4/heparin-enzyme-immunoassay were present. Signs and symptoms of thrombosis were absent. Upon immediate therapy with non-heparin anticoagulation, high dose IVIG, and prednisolone laboratory parameters steadily improved and the patient was discharged from hospital without thrombotic complications. We conclude that early initiation of VIPIT treatment results in a swift response without thrombotic complications.","Thaler, Johannes; Ay, Cihan; Gleixner, Karoline V; Hauswirth, Alexander W; Cacioppo, Filippo; Grafeneder, Jürgen; Quehenberger, Peter; Pabinger, Ingrid; Knöbl, Paul",J. thromb. haemost,,672

Yet, insufficient information on transmission dynamics has been presented to elucidate the precise risk factors for contracting SARS-CoV-2 in this group. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we investigated association between questionnaire answers on potential exposure situations and SARS-CoV-2-positivity. Health care workers with and without COVID-19-patient contact at nine units at Skåne University Hospitals in Malmö and Lund, Sweden and university employees from Lund University, Sweden were enrolled. To limit impact of health care worker to health care worker transmission, units with known outbreaks were excluded. A SARS-CoV-2-positive case was defined by a previous positive PCR or anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the ZetaGene COVID-19 Antibody Test. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-positivity was detected in 11/51 (22%) health care workers in COVID-19-units, 10/220 (5%) in non-COVID-19-units and 11/192 (6%) University employees (p = .001, Fischer's exact). In health care workers, SARS-CoV-2-positivity was associated with work in a designated COVID-19-unit (OR 5.7 (95CI 2.1-16)) and caring for COVID-19-patients during the majority of shifts (OR 5.4 (95CI 2.0-15)). In all participants, SARS-CoV-2-positivity was associated with a confirmed COVID-19 case (OR 10 (95CI 2.0-45)) in the household. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed previous findings of elevated risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in health care workers in COVID-19-units, despite exclusion of units with known outbreaks. Interestingly, health care workers in non-COVID-19-units had similar risk as University employees. Further measures to improve the safety of health care workers might be needed.KEY POINTSPrevious findings of elevated risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 in health care workers with COVID-19 patient contact was confirmed, despite exclusion of wards with known SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.

Another goal was to understand needs for education of children with IDs about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus) and other infectious diseases. Methods: Surveys, presented in the RedCap system, were administered online. Respondents (n = 498) were recruited through sites and listservs for children with disabilities and individuals with asthma. Respondents answered eight questions about knowledge and education for self-management of asthma for children with physical disabilities and IDs. Respondents answered four questions pertaining to management of coronavirus for children with IDs. Results: Respondents' indicated that it would be easier to educate youth with mild or moderate versus severe levels of disabilities. Children with IDs may not receive the education they need to manage their asthma. When comparing those in different occupations, teachers reported lower knowledge for educating children with IDs about asthma management and coronavirus. Conclusions: Doctors and nurses can develop programs for children with physical disabilities and IDs. Programming for youth with severe impairments is needed and perhaps developmentally appropriate programming for youth with IDs will improve education of youth and, concomitantly improve their self-management of asthma and potentially quality of life. Educating teachers is critical specifically about asthma triggers, how to involve youth in self-care, and how to educate children with IDs about coronavirus.","Nabors, Laura A; Bernstein, Jonathan A; Winders, Tonya A; Hart, Mary; Toledano-Toledano, Filiberto",J Asthma,,672

MethodsWe analyzed administrative data from Ontario, Canada two ways: cross-sectional and longitudinal. First, we identified the percentage and characteristics of all family physicians who had a minimum of 50 billing days in 2019 but no billings during the first six months of the pandemic. Second, for each year from 2010 to 2020, we calculated the percentage of physicians who billed for services in the first quarter of the calendar year but submitted no bills between April and September of the given year. ResultsWe found 3.1% of physicians working in 2019 (N=385/12,247) reported no billings in the first six months of the pandemic. Compared with other family physicians, a higher portion were age 75 or older (13.0% vs. 3.4%, p<0.001), had fee-for-service reimbursement (38% vs 25%, p<0.001), and had a panel size under 500 patients (40% vs 25%, p<0.001). Between 2010 and 2019, an average of 1.6% of physicians who practiced in the first quarter had no billings in each of the second and third quarters of the calendar year compared to 3.0% in 2020 (p<0.001).

457354,Perspective On The Primary Prevention Of COVID-19/ COVID-19 desde la perspectiva de la prevención primaria,2020,"BACKGROUND: The first US case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected on January 20, 2020. However, some serology studies suggest SARS-CoV-2 may have been present in the United States prior to that, as early as December 2019. The extent of domestic COVID-19 detection prior to 2020 has not been well-characterized. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody among healthcare users in the greater Seattle, Washington area from October 2019 through early April 2020. STUDY DESIGN: We tested residual samples from 766 Seattle-area adults for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies utilizing an ELISA against prefusion-stabilized Spike (S) protein. RESULTS: No antibody-positive samples were found between October 2, 2019 and March 13, 2020. Prevalence rose to 1.2% in late March and early April 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive samples in October 2019 through mid-March, 2020, provides evidence against widespread circulation of COVID-19 among healthcare users in the Seattle area during that time. A small proportion of this metropolitan-area cohort had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by spring of 2020.","McCulloch, Denise J; Jackson, Michael L; Hughes, James P; Lester, Sandra; Mills, Lisa; Freeman, Brandi; Rasheed, Mohammad Ata Ur; Thornburg, Natalie J; Chu, Helen Y",PLoS One,,672

The outcome of interest was composite poor outcome that comprised of mortality and severe COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 4448 patients were obtained from 16 studies. Cerebrovascular disease was associated with an increased composite poor outcome (RR 2.04 [1.43,2.91], p<0.001; I2: 77%). Subgroup analysis revealed that cerebrovascular disease was associated with mortality (RR 2.38 [1.92,2.96], p<0.001; I2: 0%) and showed borderline significance for severe COVID-19 (RR 1.88 [1.00,3.51], pâ¯=â¯0.05; I2: 87%). Cardiovascular disease was associated with increased composite poor outcome (RR 2.23 [1.71,2.91], p<0.001; I2: 60%), mortality (RR 2.25 [1.53,3.29], p<0.001; I2: 33%) and severe COVID-19 (RR 2.25 [1.51,3.36], p<0.001; I2: 76%). Meta-regression demonstrate that the association was not influenced by gender, age, hypertension, diabetes, and respiratory comorbidities. Furthermore, the association between cerebrovascular disease and poor outcome was not affected by cardiovascular diseases and vice versa. CONCLUSION: Cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases were associated with an increased risk for poor outcome in patients with COVID-19.","Pranata, Raymond; Huang, Ian; Lim, Michael Anthonius; Wahjoepramono, Eka Julianta; July, Julius",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,672
458263,The underrated nervous system involvement by COVID-19,2020,"Cancer patients are at a higher risk of “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)” infection than patients without cancer. In particular, Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients are at serious risk of contracting this severe infection because of many factors, such as immunosuppression, comorbidities, immune deregulation and frequent accesses to hospital. Several multicenter studies on MM patients and “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19) have been published. At present, there are no proven agents for treatment or prevention of SARS-COV-2 infection, so single or combined therapeutic approaches repurposing existing anti-viral and anti-inflammatory drugs are currently utilized to treat patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Among these, IL-6 inhibitors seem to be promising for the management of the massive cytokine storm associated with the development of the typical lung damage and consequent acute respiratory distress syndrome occurring in the most aggressive patterns of SARS-COV-2 infection. While different reports have been published about concomitant MM and Covid-19 infection, few data are available about the specific outcome of MM patients treated with IL-6 inhibitors. Available IL-6 inhibitors are siltuximab, tocilizumab and sarilumab. Siltuximab binds directly to IL-6, while tocilizumab and sarilumab target its soluble (sIL-6R) and membrane-bound receptors (mIL-6R). To our knowledge, from literature review, including case reports and case series, 49 patients (Table 1), with severe confirmed COVID-19 and MM, were treated with IL-6 inhibitors. The most used IL-6 inhibitor was tocilizumab, FDA approved for the management of CAR T-cell related Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) while no patient was reported treated with siltuximab. Clinical outcome (alive/deceased) is available for 40 on 49 patients with questionable results: 20 patients (50 %) died, 20 patients (50%) survived. Certainly, although this retrospective review includes a quite large cohort of patients (556), providing interesting information, several limitations to generalizability of findings are present. First, the number of patients with MM and COVID-19 infection treated with IL-6 inhibitors in the world, is certainly higher than one reported in case reports/case series. Second, data represent experiences of patients from different centers, treated differently in terms of drugs and according to their availability at different hospitals. Third, patients received also additional therapies for COVID-19 including hydroxychloroquine and anti-viral agents, so it is no possible distinguish absolutely the efficacy of tocilizumab (or other IL-6 inhibitors) from other drugs. An interesting aspect to focus on is the potential use of tocilizumab against MM. IL-6 is the major growth factor of human myeloma cells through an autocrine or a paracrine mechanism and tocilizumab was reported to inhibit their proliferation in vitro and to be effective in stabilize serum monoclonal protein in patients with systemic diseases (i.e. rheumatological disorders) and concomitant MM. So, in the subset of active MM patients with severe COVID-19 infection, in whom other anti-myeloma treatments could be not administrable, the possibility that tocilizumab could represent a treatment option with a double action against cytokine storm due to COVID-19 and MM itself would warrant to be verified.","Sgherza, N.; Curci, P.; Strafella, V.; Rizzi, R.; Musto, P.",HemaSphere,,672
458837,COVID-19 en pacientes españoles e inmigrantes en un área sanitaria de Madrid./ [COVID-19 in Spanish and immigrant patients in a sanitary district of Madrid],2020,"The “flatten the curve” graphic has recently become a common tool to visualize the extent to which pandemic suppression and mitigation measures could potentially reduce and delay the number of daily infections due to a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the capacity of the many healthcare systems and created cascading economic impacts on interdependent sectors of the global society. This paper specifically explores the impact of pandemics on the workforce. The model proposed in this paper comprises of three major steps. First, sources for epidemic curves are identified to generate the attack rate, which is the daily number of infections normalized with respect to the population of the affected region. Second, the model assumes that the general attack rate can be specialized to reflect sector-specific workforce classifications, noting that each economic sector has varying dependence on the workforce. Third, using economic input-output (IO) data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, this paper analyzes the performance of several mitigation and suppression measures relative to a baseline pandemic scenario. Results from the IO simulations demonstrate the extent to which mitigation and suppression measures can flatten the curve. This paper concludes with reflections on other consequences of pandemics such as the mental health impacts associated with social isolation and the disproportionate effects on different socioeconomic groups.","Santos, Joost",Sustain.

Of these, 48,557 cases and 2,169 deaths occurred in the epicenter, Wuhan. A key public health priority during the emergence of a novel pathogen is estimating clinical severity, which requires properly adjusting for the case ascertainment rate and the delay between symptoms onset and death. Using public and published information, we estimate that the overall symptomatic case fatality risk (the probability of dying after developing symptoms) of COVID-19 in Wuhan was 1.4% (0.9-2.1%), which is substantially lower than both the corresponding crude or naïve confirmed case fatality risk (2,169/48,557 = 4.5%) and the approximator1 of deaths/deaths + recoveries (2,169/2,169 + 17,572 = 11%) as of 29 February 2020. Compared to those aged 30-59 years, those aged below 30 and above 59 years were 0.6 (0.3-1.1) and 5.1 (4.2-6.1) times more likely to die after developing symptoms. The risk of symptomatic infection increased with age (for example, at ~4% per year among adults aged 30-60 years).","Wu, Joseph T; Leung, Kathy; Bushman, Mary; Kishore, Nishant; Niehus, Rene; de Salazar, Pablo M; Cowling, Benjamin J; Lipsitch, Marc; Leung, Gabriel M",Nat Med,,672

The genitourinary tract is the most common site of involvement, however, cases have also been described in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that it is the second most common site of involvement. This study investigates the clinical and histologic features of malakoplakia in the gastrointestinal tract. CASE PRESENTATION: For 23 gastrointestinal specimens (biopsies and resections) from patients with a pathologic diagnosis of malakoplakia, we recorded the gender, age, location, primary diagnosis, endoscopic or surgical indication, endoscopic/gross impression and immune status (immunocompromised vs. immunocompetent). CONCLUSION: Malakoplakia occurred throughout the length of the gastrointestinal tract with most of the cases located in the sigmoid colon and rectum (n = 10); other sites included the transverse and descending colon (n = 4), stomach/gastroesophageal junction (n = 4), appendix (n = 2), cecum (n = 1), small bowel (n = 1), and the peri-anal area (n = 1). Endoscopically, these lesions most commonly appeared as polyps (n = 10) or masses (n = 5), other clinical endoscopic impressions varied from a thickened area/fibrosis to mucosal erythema. Most patients were immunocompromised due to a disease state (e.g. organ transplantation, cancer diagnosis, autoimmune condition) and/or medication effect. Eight patients with malakoplakia were on immunosuppressive medications (8/23, 35%). Common immunosuppressed disease states included cancer (n = 9), autoimmune disease (n = 5), status post organ transplantation (n = 4), diabetes (n = 5), infection/sepsis (n = 3), and HIV/AIDS (n = 1). Some patients had multiple co-morbidities (i.e. diabetes and organ transplant).

Although the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) has been proposed as a possible mechanism of COVID-19-induced coagulopathy, its clinical significance remains uncertain. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and clinical significance of aPLs among critically ill patients with COVID-19. This prospective observational study included 60 patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units (ICU). The study outcomes included prevalence of aPLs, and a primary composite outcome of all-cause mortality and arterial or venous thrombosis between antiphospholipid-positive and antiphospholipid-negative patients during their ICU stay. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the influence of aPLs on the primary composite outcome of mortality and thrombosis. A total of 60 critically ill patients were enrolled. Among them, 57 (95%) were men, with a mean age of 52.8 ± 12.2 years, and the majority were from Asia (68%). Twenty-two patients (37%) were found be antiphospholipid-positive; 21 of them were positive for lupus anticoagulant, whereas one patient was positive for anti-ß2-glycoprotein IgG/IgM. The composite outcome of mortality and thrombosis during their ICU stay did not differ between antiphospholipid-positive and antiphospholipid-negative patients (4 [18%] vs. 6 [16%], adjusted odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.1-6.7; p value = 0.986). The presence of aPLs does not seem to affect the outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in terms of all-cause mortality and thrombosis. Therefore, clinicians may not screen critically ill patients with COVID-19 for aPLs unless deemed clinically appropriate.","Najim, Mostafa; Rahhal, Alaa; Khir, Fadi; Aljundi, Amer Hussien; Abu Yousef, Safae; Ibrahim, Feryal; Amer, Aliaa; Mohamed, Ahmed S; Saleh, Samira; Alfaridi, Dekra; Mahfouz, Ahmed; Alyafei, Sumaya; Howady, Faraj; Khatib, Mohamad; Alemadi, Samar A",Rheumatol Int,,672

Methods: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing analyses on peripheral MAIT cells from 13 patients with COVID-19 and 5 healthy donors. The transcriptional profiles of MAIT cells, together with assembled T-cell receptor sequences, were analyzed. Flow cytometry analysis was also performed to investigate the properties of MAIT cells. Results: We identified that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of MAIT cells were involved in myeloid leukocyte activation and lymphocyte activation in patients with COVID-19. In addition, in MAIT cells from severe cases, more DEGs were enriched in adaptive cellular and humoral immune responses compared with those in moderate cases. Further analysis indicated that the increase of cell cytotoxicity (killing), chemotaxis, and apoptosis levels in MAIT cells were consistent with disease severity and displayed the highest levels in patients with severe disease. Interestingly, flow cytometry analysis showed that the frequencies of pyroptotic MAIT cells, but not the frequencies of apoptotic MAIT cells, were increased significantly in patients with COVID-19, suggesting pyroptosis is one of leading causes of MAIT cell deaths during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, there were more clonal expansions of MAIT cells in severe cases than in moderate cases. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that MAIT cells are likely to be involved in the host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Simultaneously, the transcriptomic data from MAIT cells provides a deeper understanding of the immune pathogenesis of the disease.","Shi, Jijing; Zhou, Jianglin; Zhang, Xiaochang; Hu, Wei; Zhao, Jin-Fang; Wang, Shengqi; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Zhang, Ji-Yuan",Front Immunol,,672

The disease caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, reached 216 countries/territories, where about 20 million people were reported with the infection. Of these, more than 740,000 died. In view of the situation, strategies involving the development of new antiviral molecules are extremely important. The present work evaluated, through molecular docking assays, the interactions of 4'-acetamidechalcones with enzymatic and structural targets of SARS-CoV-2 and with the host's ACE2, which is recognized by the virus, facilitating its entry into cells. Therefore, it was observed that, regarding the interactions of chalcones with Main protease (Mpro), the chalcone N-(4'[(2E)-3-(4-flurophenyl)-1-(phenyl)prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPF) has the potential for coupling in the same region as the natural inhibitor FJC through strong hydrogen bonding. The formation of two strong hydrogen bonds between N-(4[(2E)-3-(phenyl)-1-(phenyl)-prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAB) and the NSP16-NSP10 heterodimer methyltransferase was also noted. N-(4[(2E)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-(phenyl)prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPM) and N-(4-[(2E)-3-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-1-(phenyl)prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPE) chalcones showed at least one strong intensity interaction of the SPIKE protein. N-(4[(2E)-3-(4-dimetilaminophenyl)-1-(phenyl)-prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPA) chalcone had a better affinity with ACE2, with strong hydrogen interactions. Together, our results suggest that 4'-acetamidechalcones inhibit the interaction of the virus with host cells through binding to ACE2 or SPIKE protein, probably generating a steric impediment. In addition, chalcones have an affinity for important enzymes in post-translational processes, interfering with viral replication.","Q Almeida-Neto, Francisco Wagner; Castro Matos, Maria Geysillene; Marinho, Emanuelle Machado; Marinho, Márcia Machado; Róseo Paula Pessoa Bezerra de Menezes, Ramon; Sampaio, Tiago Lima; Bandeira, Paulo Nogueira; Celedonio Fernandes, Carla Freire; Magno Rodrigues Teixeira, Alexandre; Marinho, Emmanuel Silva; de Lima-Neto, Pedro; Silva Dos Santos, Hélcio",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,672

RESULTS: Among 480931 patients admitted to our hospital in April 2019 and May 2019, DVT was detected in 82 patients (0.017%) (47 males, 35 females) with a mean age of 56.99 ± 9.1 years (ranges 39 to 79 years). Besides, among 145101 patients admitted to our hospital in April 2020 and May 2020, DVT was detected in 123 patients (0.084%) (51 males, 72 females) with a mean age of 58.64 ± 8.9 years (ranges 40 to 83 years). Despite the decrease in the total number of patients admitted to the hospital, there was a significant increase in the number of DVT patients. Interestingly, there were only two symptomatic pulmonary-embolism cases in the 2019 period, whereas there were seven symptomatic pulmonary embolisms secondary to DVT in the 2020 period. Unfortunately, one patient died due to pulmonary embolism secondary to DVT in 2020. The previous history of DVT was remarkable in patients admitted during the COVID-19 confinement. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, COVID-19 confinement seems to be associated with increased rates of DVT. Strict preventive measures such as exercise training or prophylactic drug use should be considered to prevent immobility-related DVT during the COVID-19 quarantine.","Karaali, Evren; Çiloglu, Osman; Demirtürk, Orhan Saim; Keklikçioglu, Burak; Akçay, Ismail; Ekiz, Timur",Phlebology,,672

We aim to share the challenges that Hematology Oncology Pharmacy (HOP) residents faced during the quarantine period and provide recommendations on how to cope with the residency journey. METHOD: We followed a qualitative methodological approach in March 2020 using a structured virtual group discussion for data generation. RESULTS: All six PGY2 hematology oncology pharmacy (HOP) residents were included in the group discussion. The group agreed that the need for HOP services during this pandemic is beyond the scope of oncology pharmacists' normal daily practice. The group recognized two fundamental points. First, the goal of the current training should be customized to the most pressing need and recognized at the national level. Second, the current training system should be improved to ensure efficient use of current resources. On this basis, the group developed six main recommendations for action. CONCLUSION: The current situation is a challenge for all healthcare providers, and the majority of the nation's current generation never dealt with such a situation in days gone by. This paper presents the challenges that should be addressed at the national level and provide a fundamental consensus recommendation for practical approaches to maximize learning and minimize disruption to trainees' progression while maintaining patient-pharmacy quality of care.","AlAzmi, Aeshah A; AlNajjar, Fouad; AlShomrani, Majed",J Oncol Pharm Pract,,672

The FLIR temperature scanner has long been used in public places, such as airports, train terminals, business establishments, factories, and skin surface measurements, as an effective tool and Elevated Body Temperature (EBT) Is helpful in identifying individuals. Affected by the global outbreak of Corona virus disease (COVID-19), it has been officially identified as an epidemic. Society is deeply concerned about the spread of infection, and is eventually looking for tools to stop the spread of the virus. The FLIR camera can be used as a screening tool to detect the increased skin temperature in the highest traffic public places through rapid individual screening. If the skin temperature is found above the average temperature in major body locations, such as the corner of the eye, and forehead, then the individual may be selected for additional screening. It is necessary to identify individuals with EBT, who should then be sent to a virus-specific diagnostic testing center for examination. This may help in reducing the spread of viruses, and infections. All the methods available to measure body temperature are all based on edge detection. These methods are very sensitive to noise, and in these the system of noise reduction is quite complex. Therefore, an automated method is being introduced to measure the temperature of the corner of the Eye and Forehead using the 'salt and pepper' and 'colormap' method, which is less complex, and still has high accuracy. © 2021 IEEE.","Tiwari, S.; Parsai, M.

However, less is known about the role of late-life onset insomnia and sex involved in these dyad or tripartite relationships. This study aimed to consider onset age of insomnia and sex in the relationship between sleep parameters, cognition and depression among older adults with current insomnia complaints. METHOD: A multistep sampling method was adopted to recruit participants with current insomnia complaints in China in 2018. Sleep measures include onset age of insomnia (64 years old or before vs during/after 65), three factors from insomnia severity index (ISI; nighttime, daytime, and perception), excessive daytime sleepiness, and sleep duration. Outcome measures were mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and center for epidemiologic studies depression scale (CESD). RESULTS: The average age of older adults was 75 (SD = 7.1). Among them, 62% participants are female. In general, older aged, female, late-life onset insomnia as well as interaction of sex * onset age of insomnia were significantly associated with poorer cognition. Yet, age, sex, and onset age of insomnia were not significant indicators for depression. For female participants, later onset of insomnia, nighttime symptoms of insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness and depression were risk factors for cognitive decline. Nevertheless, only daytime sleepiness, together with depression, were found positively associated with male participants' cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: There were robust associations between daytime sleepiness, depressive symptoms, and poor cognitive performance. More importantly, late-life onset insomnia was particularly indicative for poor cognitive performance among female older adults. Future study should emphasize the specific mechanism involved in changes of sleep patterns in the development of cognitive impairment among older adults. Sex differences in the relationship between onset age of insomnia and cognition also require further attention.","Ji, Xiaowen; Fu, Yuanyuan",Int J Geriatr Psychiatry,,672

475434,COVID-19 in Nepal: Times of Anxiety and Fear,2020,"Chronic HCV infection and associated liver cancer impose a heavy burden on the healthcare system. Direct acting antivirals eliminate HCV, unless it is drug resistant, and partially reverse liver disease, but they cannot cure HCV-related cancer. A possible remedy could be a multi-component immunotherapeutic vaccine targeting both HCV-infected and malignant cells, but also those not infected with HCV. To meet this need we developed a two-component DNA vaccine based on the highly conserved core protein of HCV to target HCV-infected cells, and a renowned tumor-associated antigen telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) based on the rat TERT, to target malignant cells. Their synthetic genes were expression-optimized, and HCV core was truncated after aa 152 (Core152opt) to delete the domain interfering with immunogenicity. Core152opt and TERT DNA were highly immunogenic in BALB/c mice, inducing IFN-γ/IL-2/TNF-α response of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Additionally, DNA-immunization with TERT enhanced cellular immune response against luciferase encoded by a co-delivered plasmid (Luc DNA). However, DNA-immunization with Core152opt and TERT mix resulted in abrogation of immune response against both components. A loss of bioluminescence signal after co-delivery of TERT and Luc DNA into mice indicated that TERT affects the in vivo expression of luciferase directed by the immediate early cytomegalovirus and interferon-β promoters. Panel of mutant TERT variants was created and tested for their expression effects. TERT with deleted N-terminal nucleoli localization signal and mutations abrogating telomerase activity still suppressed the IFN-β driven Luc expression, while the inactivated reverse transcriptase domain of TERT and its analogue, enzymatically active HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, exerted only weak suppressive effects, implying that suppression relied on the presence of the full-length/nearly full-length TERT, but not its enzymatic activity. The effect(s) could be due to interference of the ectopically expressed xenogeneic rat TERT with biogenesis of mRNA, ribosomes and protein translation in murine cells, affecting the expression of immunogens. HCV core can aggravate this effect, leading to early apoptosis of co-expressing cells, preventing the induction of immune response.","Jansons, Juris Dace Skrastina Kurlanda Alisa Petkov Stefan Avdoshina Darya Kuzmenko Yulia Krotova Olga Trofimova Olga Gordeychuk Ilya Sominskaya Irina Isaguliants Maria",Microorganisms,,672

The country is suddenly challenged by this health issue that will test its path towards peace, stability, and development. The fragile task of handling COVID-19 epidemic in Sudan is brought about by several factors such as the weak healthcare system and political conflicts, that have been intertwined with the recent regime. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, there was already high unemployment, soaring inflation and lack of social protection and safety nets for its populace. The government has been trying its best to address the pandemic, however, much still needs to be done. Neglecting Sudan by the international community in terms of support towards containment of COVID-19 has grievous implications for transition out of military dictatorship and efforts to curb the pandemic globally. As no country is safe if all is not safe. It is essential that Sudan should leverage on innovations, country-compatible measures, and other tailor-made strategies for effective responses.","Elhadi, Yasir Ahmed Mohammed; Adebisi, Yusuff Adebayo; Hassan, Khlood Fathi; Mohammed, Salma Elmukashfi Eltaher; Lin, Xu; Lucero-Prisno Iii, Don Eliseo",Pan Afr Med J,,672

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted by pediatric infectious disease specialists from 32 different hospitals from all over Turkey by case record forms. Pediatric cases who were diagnosed as COVID-19 between March 16, 2020, and June 15, 2020 were included. Case characteristics including age, sex, dates of disease onset and diagnosis, family, and contact information were recorded. Clinical data, including the duration and severity of symptoms, were also collected. Laboratory parameters like biochemical tests and complete blood count, chest X-ray, and chest computed tomography (CT) were determined. Results: There were 1,156 confirmed pediatric COVID-19 cases. In total, male cases constituted 50.3% (n = 582) and females constituted 49.7% (n = 574). The median age of the confirmed cases was 10.75 years (4.5-14.6). Of the total cases, 90 were younger than 1 year of age (7.8%), 108 were 1-3 years of age (9.3%), 148 were 3-6 years of age (12.8%), 298 were 6-12 years of age (25.8%), 233 were 12-15 years of age (20.2%), and 268 cases were older than 15 years of age (23.2%). The most common symptom of the patients at the first visit was fever (50.4%) (n = 583) for a median of 2 days (IQR: 1-3 days). Fever was median at 38.4°C (38.0-38.7°C). The second most common symptom was cough (n = 543, 46.9%). The other common symptoms were sore throat (n = 143, 12.4%), myalgia (n = 141, 12.2%), dyspnea (n = 118, 10.2%), diarrhea (n = 112, 9.7%), stomachache (n = 71, 6.1%), and nasal discharge (n = 63, 5.4%). When patients were classified according to disease severity, 263 (22.7%) patients were asymptomatic, 668 (57.7%) patients had mild disease, 209 (18.1%) had moderate disease, and 16 (1.5%) cases had severe disease. One hundred and forty-nine (12.9%) cases had underlying diseases among the total cases;56% of the patients who had severe disease had an underlying condition (p &lt; 0.01). The need for hospitalization did not differ between patients who had an underlying condition and those who do not have (p = 0.38), but the need for intensive care was higher in patients who had an underlying condition (p &lt; 0.01). Forty-seven (31.5%) of the cases having underlying conditions had asthma or lung disease (38 of them had asthma). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the largest pediatric data about confirmed COVID-19 cases. Children from all ages appear to be susceptible to COVID-19, and there is a significant difference in symptomatology and laboratory findings by means of age distribution.","Karbuz, A.; Akkoc, G.; Bedir Demirdag, T.; Yilmaz Ciftdogan, D.; Ozer, A.; Cakir, D.; Hancerli Torun, S.; Kepenekli, E.; Erat, T.; Dalgic, N.; Ilbay, S.; Karaaslan, A.; Erdeniz, E.

479079,Relationship between COVID-19 and smoking,2020,"BACKGROUND & PURPOSE: In response to the COVID-19 (C-19) pandemic, the South African government instituted strict lockdown and related legislation. Although this response was well intended, many believed it advanced children's vulnerability to abuse and neglect. This article interrogates these concerns. It investigates how C-19 legislation enabled, or constrained, South African children's protection from abuse and neglect and appraises the findings from a social-ecological resilience perspective with the aim of advancing child protection in times of emergency. METHOD: The authors conducted a rapid review of the legislation, directives and regulations pertaining to South Africa's strict lockdown (15 March to 31 May 2020). They searched two databases (SA Government platform and LexisNexus) and identified 140 documents for potential inclusion. Following full-text screening, 17 documents were reviewed. Document analysis was used to extract relevant themes. FINDINGS: The regulations and directives that informed South Africa's strict lockdown offered three protective pathways. They (i) limited C-19 contagion and championed physical health; (ii) ensured uninterrupted protection (legal and statutory) for children at risk of abuse; and (iii) advanced social protection measures available to disadvantaged households. CONCLUSION: C-19 legislation has potential to advance children's protection from abuse and neglect during emergency times. However, this potential will be curtailed if C-19 legislation is inadequately operationalised and/or prioritises physical health to the detriment of children's intellectual, emotional, social and security needs. To overcome such risks, social ecologies must work with legislators to co-design and co-operationalise C-19 legislation that will not only protect children, but advance their resilience.","Fouché, Ansie; Fouché, Daniël F; Theron, Linda C",Child Abuse Negl,,672
479495,The imaginative failure of normal: Considerations for a post-pandemic future,2020,"For individuals aspiring to a career in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, mentorship can shape destiny. Mentorship helps assure safe passage into the specialty, and it influences the arc of professional development across the career continuum. Even before the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, technology and social networking were transforming mentorship in otolaryngology. Now, in an increasingly virtual world, where in-person interactions are the exception, mentorship plays an even more pivotal role. Mentors serve as trusted guides, helping learners navigate accelerating trends toward early specialization, competency-based assessments, and key milestones. However, several structural barriers render the playing field unlevel. For medical students, cancellation of visiting clerkships, in-person rotations, and other face-to-face interactions may limit access to mentors. The pandemic and virtual landscape particularly threaten the already-leaky pipeline for underrepresented medical students. These challenges may persist into residency and later career stages, where structural inequities continue to subtly influence opportunities and pairings of mentors and mentees. Hence, overreliance on serendipitous encounters can exacerbate disparities, even amid societal mandates for equity. The decision to take deliberate steps toward mentoring outreach and engagement has profound implications for what otolaryngology will look like in years to come. This article introduces the concept of new age mentoring, shining a light on how to modernize practices. The key shifts are from passive to active engagement; from amorphous to structured relationships; and from hierarchical dynamics to bidirectional mentoring. Success is predicated on intentional outreach and purposefulness in championing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the progressively technology-driven landscape.","Ahmadmehrabi, Shadi; Farlow, Janice L; Wamkpah, Nneoma S; Esianor, Brandon I; Brenner, Michael J; Valdez, Tulio A; Malekzadeh, Sonya; Bradford, Carol R; Francis, Howard W",JAMA otolaryngol.-- head neck surg.

479885,Anti pyretic and analgesic activity of herbal formulation: Implications in managing covid-19 fever,2020,"BackgroundRestricting the movement of the public to gathering places and limiting close physical contact are effective measures against COVID-19 infection. In Japan, states of emergency have been declared in specific prefectures to reduce public movement and control COVID-19 transmission. We investigated how familiarity with the COVID-19 infection affected self-restraint related to outing behaviors during state of emergency declarations in Japan. MethodsA prospective cohort study was conducted among workers aged 20-65 years using data from an internet survey. The baseline survey was conducted on December 22-25, 2020, and a follow-up survey was on February 18-19, 2021. There were 19,941 participants who completed both surveys and were included in the final analysis. We set self-restraint regarding outing behaviors after the second state of emergency was declared in January 2021 as the dependent variable, and levels of familiarity with COVID-19 infection as independent variables. Odds ratios were estimated using multilevel logistic analyses. ResultsSignificant differences by familiarity with COVID-19 infection were identified: compared with people without a history of COVID-19 or close contact with cases of confirmed COVID-19, and those whose acquaintances had not been diagnosed with COVID-19, people with a history of COVID-19 did not refrain from most outing behaviors. People with an acquaintance diagnosed with COVID-19 were significantly more likely to refrain from most outing behaviors. There was no significant difference in any outing behavior for people with a history of close contact only. ConclusionsTo maximize the effect of emergency declarations, health authorities should disseminate information for each person in the target population, taking into account potential differences related to the familiarity with the infection.","MORI, TAKAHIRO; Nagata, Tomohisa; Ikegami, Kazunori; Hino, Ayako; Tateishi, Seiichiro; Tsuji, Mayumi; Matsuda, Shinya; Fujino, Yoshihisa; Mori, Koji",,,672

However, the vast majority of studies are representative of Asian and Caucasian population and fewer represent an African-American population. METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective observational study, we included all adult patients (> 18 years old) admitted to Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients were classified according to having a known diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Demographic and clinical data, comorbidities, outcomes and laboratory findings were obtained. RESULTS: Our sample included a total of 355 patients. 70% were African-American, and 47% had diabetes. Patients with diabetes had higher peak inflammatory markers like CRP 184 (111-258) versus 142 (65-229) p = 0.012 and peak LDH 560 (384-758) versus 499 (324-655) p = 0.017.

In order to gain further profound knowledge about the different EC-induced physiological and pathophysiological effects, appropriate analytical methods are required. The method described here uses liquid chromatography in combination with positive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to quantify the concentrations of the above-mentioned EC compounds in cells. Sample preparation prior to LC-MS/MS analysis was performed by means of two liquid extractions with ethyl acetate. The method has been validated according to the bioanalytical guidelines of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The lower limits of quantification were 0.03 ng/mL for AEA, 2 ng/mL for 2-AG, 0.03 ng/mL for NADA, 0.3 ng/mL for 2-AGE and 0.15 ng/mL for VA. Linearity was demonstrated up to 10 ng/mL (AEA, NADA, 2-AGE and VA) and 50 ng/mL (2-AG). The values for intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy were within the guideline recommended acceptance criteria for assay validation. Low matrix effects and good recovery were found for AEA, 2-AG and 2-AGE, while a higher matrix effect was observed for NADA and VA. Extraction yields were lowest for VA.

METHODS: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to 28 February 2021, to identify randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome was reintubation within 24-72 hours after a planned extubation. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Six articles with1746 patients were included. The effect of HFNC on the reintubation rate was noninferior to that of NIV (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.85-1.44). The rate of treatment failure was 20.40% with HFNC versus 20.92% with NIV; this difference was nonsignificant (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.72-1.32, P = 0.85). HFNC reduced the rates of skin lesion occurrence (10.28% versus 23.82%, OR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.26-0.53, P < 0.00001) and post-extubation respiratory failure (23.76% versus 25.56%, OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.46-0.88, P = 0.006), compared with NIV. CONCLUSIONS: In extubated patients, HFNC was noninferior to NIV in the rate of reintubation and treatment failure.

In this study, an observational welfare assessment tool developed by the EU Directive was revised to be species-specific for the giant Pacific octopus, Enteroctopus dofleini. This E. dofleini health and welfare assessment tool includes categories assessing E. dofleini external appearance, behavior, and clinical signs of stress and disease. These categories are scored in severity from 1 to 4, allowing a quantitative perspective on health observations. Six facilities used the health and welfare assessment tool to evaluate E. dofleini until the animal was humanely euthanized or died naturally. Results showed an irreversible upward trend in scores for feeding behavior and response to stimulus beginning 4 weeks prior to death, with significant changes in health and welfare scores between 4 weeks and the final week prior to death. This suggests that upward trends in these two variables predict death within 3-4 weeks. Highly variable results between individuals for other categories indicate that a quantitative tool can help assess health and welfare at the individual level.","Holst, Meghan M; Miller-Morgan, Tim",J Appl Anim Welf Sci,,672

Before it, the cost issues and different regulations in various countries have hindered the widespread use of the Point-of-Care Testing (POCT). Suppose we can electronically control it using Si nanotechnology, named e-POCT. Following the concept of IoT sensors, we can expect that a plenty of deployed e- POCTs may retrieve digital data about where, when, how much, and which virus is being spread. The collected digital data (to be BigData) can be analyzed by AI machines to optimize the global distribution of medical resources. The core technology for e-POCT must be an electronic biosensing. It is composed of a controlling system to selectively collect biomolecules (specific to targeted virus) in specimen solutions, oxide films (or membranes, polymers) to adhere specific biomolecules, and a sensing system to convert the adhered biomolecules to electrical signals. The efficiencies and reliabilities of the components are critical to the performance of the virus sensing. The performance can be characterized by the Limit-of-Detection (LoD) and detection time.

In arguing that an accommodation between these two states will be a necessary (but not sufficient) prerequisite if the EU is to accomplish reforms, I turn to the current state of Franco-German relations on EU reform. I focus also on Germany, arguably the most consistent advocate of deeper integration across decades, and therefore a critical case for the impact of domestic political contestation on the reform debate.

LPV plasma concentrations in 92 patients hospitalized at our institution were prospectively collected. Lopinavir-ritonavir was administered every 12 hours, 800/200 mg on day 1 and 400/100 mg on day 2 until day 5 or 7. HCQ was given at 800 mg, followed by 400 mg after 6, 24, and 48 h. Hematological, liver, kidney, and inflammation laboratory values were analyzed on the day of drug level determination. The median age of study participants was 59 (range, 24 to 85) years, and 71% were male. The median durations from symptom onset to hospitalization and treatment initiation were 7 days (interquartile range [IQR], 4 to 10) and 8 days (IQR, 5 to 10), respectively.

Notwithstanding, implications vary depending on country, region, and strictness of coronavirus containment measures. Thus, the impact of COVID-19 on food and nutritional security was expected to be dire in sub-Saharan Africa because of its enormous reliance on global food systems. This article explored the implications of COVID-19 on sustainable production and consumption by focusing on common beans, vegetables, fish, and fruits produced and consumed in rural, peri-urban and urban areas. Two surveys were conducted to collect quantitative data from 619 producers in rural areas and 307 consumers from peri-urban and urban areas of ten Eastern and Southern African countries. Descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages) and chi-square test for independence were used to analyse the data. The results show that the pandemic disrupted bean production and consumption across the two sub-regions. However, Southern African farmers and consumers were disproportionately more affected. While farmers in Eastern Africa reported input market challenges, those in Southern Africa identified challenges related to marketing farm produce. We also report that home gardening in urban and peri-urban areas enhanced urban food systems’ resilience to the impacts of the pandemic on food security. The study argues that short food supply chains can sustain rural and urban livelihood against adverse effects of the pandemics and contribute towards sustainable production and consumption.

493121,Implementation of a visual raise hand function in PowerPoint®,2021,"BACKGROUND: India follows a pluralistic system for strategic and focused health care delivery in which traditional systems of medicine such as Ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa, and homoeopathy (AYUSH) coexist with contemporary medicine, and this system functions under the Ministry of AYUSH (MoA). The MoA developed a mobile app, called AYUSH Sanjivani, to document the trends of the use of AYUSH-based traditional and holistic measures by the public across India. Analysis of the data generated through this app can help monitor the extent of the use of AYUSH measures for maintenance of health during the COVID-19 pandemic and aid effective health promotion and communication efforts focused on targeted health care delivery during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to determine the extent of use of AYUSH measures by the public in India for maintenance of health during the COVID-19 pandemic as reported through the AYUSH Sanjivani mobile app. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of the data generated through the Ayush Sanjivani app from May 4 to July 31, 2020, was performed to study the pattern and extent of the use of AYUSH-based measures by the Indian population. The responses of the respondents in terms of demographic profile, use pattern, and benefits obtained;the association between the use of AYUSH-based measures and symptomatic status;and the association between the duration of use of AYUSH-based measures and the outcome of COVID-19 testing were evaluated based on bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Data from 723,459 respondents were used for the analysis, among whom 616,295 (85.2%) reported that they had been using AYUSH measures for maintenance of health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among these 616,295 users, 553,801 (89.8%) either strongly or moderately agreed to have benefitted from AYUSH measures. Ayurveda and homeopathic measures and interventions were the most preferred by the respondents across India. Among the 359,785 AYUSH users who described their overall improvement in general health, 144,927 (40.3%) rated it as good, 30,848 (8.6%) as moderate, and 133,046 (40.3%) as slight. Respondents who had been using AYUSH measures for less than 30 days were more likely to be COVID-19-positive among those who were tested (odds ratio 1.52, 95% CI 1.44-1.60). The odds of nonusers of AYUSH measures being symptomatic if they tested positive were greater than those of AYUSH users (odds ratio 4.01, 95% CI 3.61-4.59). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this cross-sectional analysis assert that a large proportion of the representative population practiced AYUSH measures across different geographic locations of the country during the COVID-19 pandemic and benefitted considerably in terms of general well-being, with a possible impact on their quality of life and specific domains of health.","Srikanth, N.; Rana, R.; Singhal, R.; Jameela, S.; Singh, R.; Khanduri, S.; Tripathi, A.; Goel, S.; Chhatre, L.; Chandra, A.; Rao, B.

The pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 disease are tightly influenced by the host immune response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. In some condition, the immune response might be uncontrolled, giving rise to hyperinflammatory conditions marked by excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines (cytokine storms) in severe COVID-19 patients, which then can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan failure, and death. Furthermore, treatment using immunomodulator agents including immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive agents can be an option in achieving successful treatment. In this review, we discuss the pathogenesis of the disease, including host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, and immune mechanisms which contribute to the disease severity and death as well as several potential immunomodulatory agents which can be used in the management of hyperinflammatory syndrome of severe COVID-19.","Hidayat, M.; Handayani, D.; Nurwidya, F.; Andarini, S.

This aspect simplifies the estimation process, but does not consider the influence of relatively small changes in the design variables in terms of the objective function. In this work, the SIDR (Susceptible, Infected, Dead and Recovered) model is used to simulate the dynamic behavior of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and its parameters are estimated by formulating a robust inverse problem, that is, considering the sensitivity of design variables. For this purpose, a robust multi-objective optimization problem is formulated, considering the minimization of uncertainties associated to the estimation process and the maximization of the robustness parameter. To solve this problem, the Multi-objective Stochastic Fractal Search algorithm is associated with the Effective Mean concept for the evaluation of robustness. The results obtained considering real data of the epidemic in China demonstrate that the evaluation of the sensitivity of the design variables can provide more reliable results.","Libotte, Gustavo Barbosa; Lobato, Fran S'ergio; Platt, Gustavo Mendes",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00289v1.pdf,672

It is incumbent on health professional associations to assist their membership in defining and preparing for AI-related change. Health professional associations, or the national groups convened to represent the interests of the members of a profession, play a unique role in establishing the sociocultural, normative, and regulative elements of health care professions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to present a protocol for a proposed study of how, when faced with AI as a disruptive technology, health professional associations engage in sensemaking and legitimization of change to support their membership in preparing for future practice. METHODS: An exploratory multi-case study approach will be used. This study will be informed by the normalization process theory (NPT), which suggests behavioral constructs required for complex change, providing a novel lens through which to consider the agency of macrolevel actors in practice change. A total of 4 health professional associations will be studied, each representing an instrumental case and related fields selected for their early consideration of AI technologies. Data collection will consist of key informant interviews, observation of relevant meetings, and document review. Individual and collective sensemaking activities and action toward change will be identified using stakeholder network mapping. A hybrid inductive and deductive model will be used for a concurrent thematic analysis, mapping emergent themes against the NPT framework to assess fit and identify areas of discordance. RESULTS: As of January 2021, we have conducted 17 interviews, with representation across the 4 health professional associations. Of these 17 interviews, 15 (88%) have been transcribed. Document review is underway and complete for one health professional association and nearly complete for another. Observation opportunities have been challenged by competing priorities during COVID-19 and may require revisiting. A linear cross-case analytic approach will be taken to present the data, highlighting both guidance for the implementation of AI and implications for the application of NPT at the macro level. The ability to inform consideration of AI will depend on the degree to which the engaged health professional associations have considered this topic at the time of the study and, hence, what priority it has been assigned within the health professional association and what actions have been taken to consider or prepare for it. The fact that this may differ between health professional associations and practice environments will require consideration throughout the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Ultimately, this protocol outlines a case study approach to understand how, when faced with AI as a disruptive technology, health professional associations engage in sensemaking and legitimization of change to support their membership in preparing for future practice.

Prior studies have raised concerns about patients' ability to form antibodies in response to various antigens, especially SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study is to determine whether OCR attenuates the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with MS as compared with other disease modifying therapies. METHODS: This is a case-control study looking at the odds of developing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in patients treated with OCR versus other disease modifying therapies. From May 13, 2020 through March 1, 2021, patients with a RT-PCR-confirmed infection to SARS-CoV-2 were tested for presence of antibodies and the data was recorded. Outpatients with MS at the Methodist Hospitals Comprehensive MS Center were selected who had a prior infection with COVID-19 as demonstrated by RT-PCR in the electronic health records. Odds ratios were calculated to compare rates of antibody formation with OCR exposure vs other DMT. RESULTS: 24 patients had evidence of COVID-19 and had antibody testing available at the time of analysis. Patients who received OCR had decreased odds of forming antibodies (OR 0.045, p = 0.011, 95% CI (0.004,0.488)). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received OCR within the prior 6 months of COVID-19 infection had decreased odds of developing antibodies as compared with other DMTs. This suggests that OCR may attenuate the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. Additional studies should analyze the odds of spike protein antibody formation in response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for patients on OCR.","Conte, William L",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,672

METHODS: To identify intermediate traits associated with the 3p21.31 locus, we first performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) with 923 phenotypes in 310,999 European individuals from the UK Biobank. For genes potentially regulated by the COVID-19 risk variant, we examined associations between their expression and the polygenic score (PGS) of 1,263 complex traits in a meta-analysis of 31,684 blood samples. For the prioritized blood cell traits, we tested their associations with age and sex in the same UK Biobank sample. RESULTS: Our PheWAS highlighted multiple blood cell traits to be associated with the COVID-19 risk variant, including monocyte count and percentage (p = 1.07×10 -8, 4.09×10 -13), eosinophil count and percentage (p = 5.73×10 -3, 2.20×10 -3), and neutrophil percentage (p = 3.23×10 -3). The PGS analysis revealed positive associations between the expression of candidate genes and genetically predicted counts of specific blood cells: CCR3 with eosinophil and basophil (p = 5.73×10 -21, 5.08×10 -19); CCR2 with monocytes (p = 2.40×10 -10); and CCR1 with monocytes and neutrophil (p = 1.78×10 -6, 7.17×10 -5). Additionally, we found that almost all examined white blood cell traits are significantly different across age and sex groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that altered blood cell traits, especially those of monocyte, eosinophil, and neutrophil, may represent the mechanistic links between the genetic locus 3p21.31 and severe COVID-19. They may also underlie the increased risk of severe COVID-19 in older adults and men.","Zhou, Jingqi; Sun, Yitang; Huang, Weishan; Ye, Kaixiong","J. gerontol. Ser. A, Biol. sci. med. sci",,672

This may be especially challenging for brain tumor patients given increased vulnerability due to their pre-existing condition. Here, we aimed to investigate the quality of life (QoL) in brain tumor patients and relatives in this setting. Over twelve weeks during the first wave of the pandemic (04-07/2020), brain tumor patients and their families from two large German tertiary care centers were asked to complete weekly questionnaires for anxiety, depression, distress, and well-being. Information regarding social support and living conditions was also collected. One hundred participants (63 patients, 37 relatives) completed 729 questionnaires over the course of the study. Compared to relatives, patients showed more depressive symptoms (p < 0.001) and reduced well-being (p = 0.013). While acceptance of lockdown measures decreased over time, QoL remained stable. QoL measures between patients and their families were weakly or moderately correlated. The number of social contacts was strongly associated with QoL. Age, living conditions, ongoing therapy, employment, and physical activity were other predictors. QoL is correlated between patients and their families and heavily depends on social support factors, indicating the need to focus on the entire family and their social situation for QoL interventions during the pandemic.","Troschel, Fabian M; Ahndorf, Franziska; Wille, Lisa-Marie; Brandt, Ralf; Jost, Johanna; Rekowski, Sylvia; Eich, Hans Theodor; Stummer, Walter; Wiewrodt, Rainer; Jetschke, Kathleen; Wiewrodt, Dorothee",,,672

Recovery from crises, then, provides the opportunity to address these underlying issues that preceded and, likely, contributed to the crises or dislocation; meanwhile, a return to the previous normalcy following such crises generally means exacerbation of these weaknesses that erode and threaten to fracture social, economic and political foundations. This paper documents social and economic policies across two financial crises, the Asian Financial Crisis and the Global Financial Crisis, for South Korea, the Philippines, and Indonesia, to reveal the problems from growth-centric recovery focus on economic fragilities, social cohesion, and political stability. Further, using evidence from the ground and survey data, we also show how recovery to a new normal with a reprioritization of social policies invigorates the social, political, and economic foundations. We round off the study with an examination of social policy changes under COVID-19 to assess how the efforts track against a recovery to business-as-usual economic normalcy or a new normal that reprioritizes social policies and the economy.

506475,Regarding the lack of transparency in technical documents for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in Peru/ Sobre la escasa transparencia en los documentos técnicos para el tratamiento de pacientes con COVID-19 en Perú,2020,"This paper estimates the cost of the lockdown of some sectors of the world economy in the wake of COVID-19. We develop a multi sector disequilibrium model with buyer-seller relations between agents located in different countries. The production network model allows us to study not only the direct cost of the lockdown but also indirect costs which emerge from the reductions in the availability of intermediate inputs. Agents determine the quantity of output and the proportions in which to combine inputs using prices that emerge from local interactions. The model is calibrated to the world economy using input-output data on 56 industries in 44 countries including all major economies. Within our model, the lockdowns are implemented as partial reductions in the output of some sectors using data on sectoral decomposition of capacity reductions. We use computational experiments to replicate the temporal sequence of the lockdowns implemented in different countries. World output falls by 7% at the early stage of the crisis when only China is under lockdown and by 23% at the peak of the crisis when many countries are under a lockdown. These direct impacts are amplified as the shock propagates through the world economy because of the buyer-seller relations. Supply-chain spillovers are capable of amplifying the direct impact by more than two folds. Naturally, the substitutability between intermediate inputs is a major determinant of the amplification. We also study the process of economic recovery following the end of the lockdowns. Price flexibility and minor technological adaptations help in reducing the time it takes for the economy to recover. The world economy takes about one quarter to move towards the new equilibrium in the optimistic and unlikely scenario of the end of all lockdowns. Recovery time is likely to be significantly greater if partial lockdowns persist.","Mandel, Antoine; Veetil, Vipin",Econ Disaster Clim Chang,,672

However, cardiac injury is defined mainly by troponin elevation without description of associated structural abnormalities and its time course has not been studied. RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the ECG and echocardiographic abnormalities as well as their time course in critically ill COVID-19 patients? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The cardiac function of 43 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to two ICUs was assessed prospectively and repeatedly, combining ECG, cardiac biomarker, and transthoracic echocardiographic analyses from ICU admission to ICU discharge or death or to a maximum follow-up of 14 days. Cardiac injury was defined by troponin elevation and newly diagnosed ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities, or both. RESULTS: At baseline, 49% of patients demonstrated a cardiac injury, and 70% of patients experienced cardiac injury within the first 14 days of ICU stay, with a median time of occurrence of 3 days (range, 0-7 days). The most frequent abnormalities were ECG or echocardiographic signs, or both, of left ventricular (LV) abnormalities (87% of patients with cardiac injury), right ventricular (RV) systolic dysfunction (47%), pericardial effusion (43%), new-onset atrial arrhythmias (33%), LV relaxation impairment (33%), and LV systolic dysfunction (13%). Between baseline and day 14, the incidence of pericardial effusion and of new-onset atrial arrhythmias increased and the incidence of ECG or echocardiographic signs, or both, of LV abnormalities as well as the incidence of LV relaxation impairment remained stable, whereas the incidence of RV and LV systolic dysfunction decreased. INTERPRETATION: Cardiac injury is common and early in critically ill COVID-19 patients. ECG or echocardiographic signs, or both, of LV abnormalities were the most frequent abnormalities, and patients with cardiac injury experienced more RV than LV systolic dysfunction.","Doyen, Denis; Dupland, Pierre; Morand, Lucas; Fourrier, Etienne; Saccheri, Clément; Buscot, Matthieu; Hyvernat, Hervé; Ferrari, Emile; Bernardin, Gilles; Cariou, Alain; Mira, Jean-Paul; Jamme, Matthieu; Dellamonica, Jean; Jozwiak, Mathieu",Chest,,672

Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 may also elicit a cytokine storm, which accounts for disease progression and ultimately the urgent need of ventilator support. Based upon several reports, it has been argued that early treatment with IFN-alpha2 or IFN-beta, preferentially in the early disease stage, may prohibit disease progression. Similarly, preliminary studies have shown that JAK1/2 inhibitor treatment with ruxolitinib or baricitinib may decrease mortality by dampening the deadly cytokine storm, which - in addition to the virus itself - also contributes to multi-organ thrombosis and multi-organ failure. Herein, we describe the rationale for treatment with IFNs (alpha2 or beta) and ruxolitinib emphasizing the urgent need to explore these agents in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 - both as monotherapies and in combination. In this context, we take advantage of several safety and efficacy studies in patients with the chronic myeloproliferative blood cancers (essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis) (MPNs), in whom IFN-alpha2 and ruxolitinib have been used successfully for the last 10 (ruxolitinib) to 30 years (IFN) as monotherapies and most recently in combination as well. In the context of these agents being highly immunomodulating (IFN boosting immune cells and JAK1/2 inhibitors being highly immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory), we also discuss if statins and hydroxyurea, both agents possessing anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and antiviral potentials, might be inexpensive agents to be repurposed in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.","Hasselbalch, H C; Skov, V; Kjær, L; Ellervik, C; Poulsen, A; Poulsen, T D; Nielsen, C H",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,,672

509883,COVID-19. De la patogenia a la elevada mortalidad en el adulto mayor y con comorbilidades/ COVID-19. From pathogenesis to high mortality in elderly patients with comorbidities,2020,"BACKGROUND: Testing is crucial for COVID-19 response and management, however, WHO's preparedness index omits estimations of actual testing capabilities, which influence the ability to contain, mitigate and clinically manage infectious diseases. With one of the highest excess death rates globally, Ecuador had a comparatively low number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, which may have been influenced by limited availability of data for decision-making due to low laboratory capacity. METHODS: We examine de-identified data on 55,063 individuals with suspected COVID-19 between February 27 and April 30, 2020 included in the RT-PCR testing database collected by the Ministry of Health. Processing times and rates per province, and the number of pending tests, were tallied cumulatively. We assessed the relationship between sample shipping, laboratory capacity and case completion using a negative binomial generalized linear model. RESULTS: The national average time for case completion was 3 days; 12.1% of samples took &#8805;10 days to complete; the national average daily backlog was 29.1 tests per 100,000 people. Only 8 out of 24 provinces had authorized COVID-19 processing laboratories but not all processed samples. There was an association between samples coming from outside the processing laboratory province, the number of other samples present at the laboratory during processing, and the amount of time needed to process a sample. Samples from another province took 1.29 times as long to process, on average. The percentage of pending results on April 30 was 67.1%. CONCLUSION: A centralized RT-PCR testing system contributes to critical delays in processing, which may mask a case burden higher than reported, impeding timely awareness, and adequate clinical care and vaccination strategies and subsequent monitoring. Although Ecuador adapted or authorized existing facilities to address limitations in laboratory capacity for COVID-19, this study highlights the need to estimate and augment laboratory capabilities for improved decision making and policies on diagnostic guidelines and availability. Support is needed to procure the necessary human and physical resources at all phases of diagnostic testing, including transportation of samples and supplies, and information management. Strengthening emergency preparedness enables a clear understanding of COVID-19 disparities within and across the country.","Torres, Irene; Sippy, Rachel; Sacoto, Fernando",BMC Public Health,,672

The transcription factor, nuclear factor-&#954;-B (NF&#954;B) is a key inflammatory player that is antagonized via anti-inflammatory actions exerted by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). However, technical limitations have restricted our understanding of how GR is involved in the dynamics of NF&#954;B in vivo. In this study, we used an improved lentiviral-based reporter to elucidate the time course of NF&#954;B and GR activities during behavioral changes from sickness to depression induced by a systemic lipopolysaccharide challenge. The trajectory of NF&#954;B activity established a behavioral basis for the NF&#954;B signal transition involved in three phases, sickness-early-phase, normal-middle-phase, and depressive-like-late-phase. The temporal shift in brain GR activity was differentially involved in the transition of NF&#954;B signals during the normal and depressive-like phases. The middle-phase GR effectively inhibited NF&#954;B in a glucocorticoid-dependent manner, but the late-phase GR had no inhibitory action. Furthermore, we revealed the cryptic role of basal GR activity in the early NF&#954;B signal transition, as evidenced by the fact that blocking GR activity with RU486 led to early depressive-like episodes through the emergence of the brain NF&#954;B activity. These results highlight the inhibitory action of GR on NF&#954;B by the basal and activated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis during body-to-brain inflammatory spread, providing clues about molecular mechanisms underlying systemic inflammation caused by such as COVID-19 infection, leading to depression.","Han, Young-Min; Kim, Min Sun; Jo, Juyeong; Shin, Daiha; Kwon, Seung-Hae; Seo, Jong Bok; Kang, Dongmin; Lee, Byoung Dae; Ryu, Hoon; Hwang, Eun Mi; Kim, Jae-Min; Patel, Paresh D; Lyons, David M; Schatzberg, Alan F; Her, Song",Mol. psychiatry,,672

We speculate that the perceived threat of COVID-19 is related to a general, non-target-specific aggressive tendency during the pandemic. We surveyed 1556 Chinese people in April 2020 (757 people in Hubei Province, the pandemic epicenter in China, and 799 in other regions of China where the pandemic is relatively not severe). A multiple-group structural equation modeling analysis found significant total effects between perceived threat of COVID-19 and aggressive tendencies during the pandemic in both regional groups, and the effect between them was mainly achieved through the mediating roles of sense of control and powerlessness during the pandemic. For all participants, negative coping strategies significantly aggravated the association between perceived threat of COVID-19 and aggressive tendencies during the pandemic, but the buffers were different across regions of outbreak severity. For participants in other regions where the pandemic is relatively not severe, positive coping strategies could mitigate the association between perceived threat of COVID-19 and aggressions. However, for participants in Hubei Province, the epicenter of China's pandemic, higher life satisfaction was more effective in buffering. These findings extend the possible consequences of the perceived COVID-19 threat and suggest that improving the life satisfaction of residents in areas with severe outbreaks is more effective in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19.

Methods: The consecutive records of 93 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital from January 10, 2020, to February 22, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. A series of chest CT findings and clinical data were collected and analyzed. The serial chest CT scans were scored on a semiquantitative basis according to the extent of pulmonary abnormalities. Chest CT scores in different periods (0 - 5 days, 6 - 10 days, 11 - 15 days, 16 - 20 days, and > 20 days) since symptom onset were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors, and the temporal trend of the radiographic-clinical features was analyzed. Results: The final cohort consisted of 93 patients: 68 survivors and 25 nonsurvivors. Nonsurvivors were significantly older than survivors. For both survivors and nonsurvivors, the chest CT scores were not different in the first period (0 - 5 days) but diverged afterwards. The mortality rate of COVID-19 monotonously increased with chest CT scores, which positively correlated with the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil percentage, D-dimer level, lactate dehydrogenase level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, while negatively correlated with the lymphocyte percentage and lymphocyte count. Conclusions: Chest CT scores correlate well with risk factors for mortality over periods, thus they may be used as a prognostic indicator in COVID-19. While higher chest CT scores are associated with a higher mortality rate, CT images taken at least 6 days since symptom onset may contain more prognostic information than images taken at an earlier period.","Li, Lingli; Yang, Lian; Gui, Shan; Pan, Feng; Ye, Tianhe; Liang, Bo; Hu, Yu; Zheng, Chuansheng",Theranostics,,672

In past decades, autism was conceptualized as a strictly defined set of behaviors, usually accompanied by intellectual impairment. Today, it is recognized as a spectrum, ranging from mild to severe, in which behaviors vary substantially and the majority of children who fall on the spectrum have average to above average intellectual ability.

We show that natural human movements are statistically diverse, and the spread of the disease is significantly influenced by a small group of active individuals and gathering venues. We find that interventions focused on these most mobile individuals and popular venues reduce both the peak infection rate and the total infected population while retaining high social activity levels. These trends are seen consistently in simulations with real human mobility data of different scales, resolutions, and modalities from multiple cities across the world. The observation implies that compared to broad sweeping interventions, more heterogeneous strategies that are targeted based on the network effects in human mobility provide a better balance between pandemic control and regular social activities.","Wang, Haotian; Ghosh, Abhirup; Ding, Jiaxin; Sarkar, Rik; Gao, Jie",Sci Rep,,672

In late February, the disease began to spread quickly across the world, causing serious health, social, and economic emergencies. This paper aims to forecast the short to medium-term incidence of COVID-19 epidemic through the medium of an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, applied to Italy, Russia, and the USA The analysis is carried out on the number of new daily confirmed COVID-19 cases, collected by Worldometer website. The best ARIMA models are Italy (4,2,4), Russia (1,2,1), and the USA (6,2,3). The results show that: i) ARIMA models are reliable enough when new daily cases begin to stabilize; ii) Italy, the USA, and Russia reached the peak of COVID-19 infections in mid-April, mid-May, and late May, respectively; and iii) Russia and the USA will require much more time than Italy to drop COVID-19 cases near zero.

Even in robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS), mesorectal division is difficult in a narrow pelvic cavity. To overcome this difficulty, we invented a novel method of mesorectal division. In this new approach, we switched the fenestrated bipolar forceps and the double-fenestrated forceps with each other so that both instruments were placed on the same (right) side of the patient. After the mesorectal fat and vessels were coagulated using the fenestrated bipolar forceps, coagulated tissues were divided using the monopolar scissors in the same direction. We named this technique the ""simple switching technique (SST)"". We retrospectively collected data and evaluated the usefulness of SST in 24 consecutive patients who underwent RALS TSME between July 2018 and January 2020. Twelve patients underwent SST, and 12 patients underwent other conventional surgical methods (non-SST). The median operation time for mesorectal division was 809.5 s (range 395-1491 s) in the SST group and 985.5 s (range 493-2353 s) in the non-SST group. The coefficient of variation for non-SST was 0.545, which was > 1.5 times the coefficient of 0.360 for SST. Although no significant differences were found for operation time for mesorectal division, the operation time for mesorectal division by SST tended to be shorter than by non-SST (P = 0.157). No significant differences were found regarding short-term outcomes between the groups. SST is feasible and can be an optional method of mesorectal division in RALS TSME.","Takeyama, Hiroshi; Danno, Katsuki; Nishigaki, Takahiko; Yamashita, Masafumi; Oka, Yoshio",Updates surg.

But disentangling the mechanism underlying RNA chaperoning is challenging, mostly due to inherent disorder of the chaperones and the transient nature of their interactions with RNA. In particular, it is unclear how specific the interactions are and what role is played by amino acid charge and polarity patterns. Here, we address these questions in the RNA chaperone StpA. By adapting direct coupling analysis (DCA) to treat in tandem sequences written in two alphabets, nucleotides and amino acids, we could analyze StpA-RNA interactions and show consistency with a previously proposed two-pronged mechanism: StpA disrupts specific positions in the group I intron while globally and loosely binding to the entire structure. Moreover, the interactions are strongly associated with the charge pattern: negatively charged regions in the destabilizing StpA N-terminal affect a few specific positions in the RNA, located in stems and in the pseudoknot. In contrast, positive regions in the C-terminal contain strongly coupled amino acids that promote non-specific or weakly-specific binding to the RNA. The present study opens new avenues to examine the functions of disordered proteins and to design disruptive proteins based on their charge patterns.","Reinharz, Vladimir; Tlusty, Tsvi",RNA,,672

590408,Nódulo pulmonar único con signo del halo inverso en infección COVID-19: hallazgo incidental en PET/TC,2021-01-22,"BACKGROUND: Sickness presenteeism (SP) indicates “going to work while being ill.” The importance of SP has only recently been investigated, and the association between SP and employment status has been inconsistent across studies. Therefore, we conducted this study to explore the association between SP and employment status by using presenteeism propensity (PP), which can reflect the individual decision-making process. METHODS: The study population included employees participating in the 5th Korean Working Condition Survey. We analyzed data of only employees with at least one health event, which was calculated as the sum of SP and sickness absenteeism days. Employment status was grouped into 3 categories: stable employment, unstable employment (contract period ≥ 1 year), and unstable employment (contract period < 1 year). Survey-weighted logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between employment status and PP (dichotomized as “≤ 0.5” and “> 0.5”). RESULTS: Unstable employees (contract period ≥ 1 year) had higher odds of PP than stable employees (odds ratio [OR]: 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03–1.47), whereas unstable employees (contract period < 1 year) had lower odds of PP than stable employees (OR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.71–0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Employment status was associated with SP. Given the negative health impact of SP, social efforts, such as paid sick leave, are required to reduce SP and enhance the health status of unstable workers.","Park, Jeong Woo; Cho, Seong Sik; Lee, JongWoo; Hwang, Jonghyun; Kim, Jung Il; Kim, Byoung Gwon; Hong, Young Seoub",Ann Occup Environ Med,https://doi.org/10.35371/aoem.2020.32.e17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32676195/,672

Over the past decade, we aimed to decipher how the extra domains/co-factors mediate the catalytic machineries of SARS 3C-like, Dengue and Zika NS2B-NS3 proteases by characterizing their folding, structures, dynamics and inhibition with NMR, X-ray crystallography and MD simulations, and the results revealed: 1) the chymotrypsin fold of the SARS 3C-like protease can independently fold, while, by contrast, those of Dengue and Zika proteases lack the intrinsic capacity to fold without co-factors. 2) Mutations on the extra domain of SARS 3C-like protease can transform the active catalytic machinery into the inactive collapsed state by structurally-driven allostery. 3) Amazingly, even without detectable structural changes, mutations on the extra domain are sufficient to either inactivate or enhance the catalytic machinery of SARS 3C-like protease by dynamically-driven allostery. 4) Global networks of correlated motions have been identified: for SARS 3C-like protease, N214A inactivates the catalytic machinery by decoupling the network, while STI/A and STIF/A enhance by altering the patterns of the network. The global networks of Dengue and Zika proteases are coordinated by their NS2B-cofactors. 5) Natural products were identified to allosterically inhibit Zika and Dengue proteases through binding a pocket on the back of the active site. Therefore, by introducing extra domains/cofactors, nature develops diverse strategies to regulate the catalytic machinery embedded on the chymotrypsin fold through folding, structurally- and dynamically-driven allostery, all of which might be exploited to develop antiviral drugs.","Lim, Liangzhong; Gupta, Garvita; Roy, Amrita; Kang, Jian; Srivastava, Shagun; Shi, Jiahai; Song, Jianxing",Prog Biophys Mol Biol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610718301421; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2018.08.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0079610718301421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30217495/,672

METHODS: Acute care hospitals in Ontario were surveyed regarding their pandemic influenza preparedness plans. RESULTS: The response rate was 78.5%, and 95 of 121 hospitals participated. Three quarters (76.8%, 73 of 95) of hospitals had pandemic influenza plans. Only 16.4% (12 of 73) of hospitals with plans had tested them. Larger (χ(2) = 6.7, P = .01) and urban hospitals (χ(2) = 5.0, P = .03) were more likely to have tested their plans. 70.4% (50 of 71) Of respondents thought the pandemic influenza planning process was not adequately funded. No respondents were “very satisfied” with the completeness of their hospital's pandemic plan, and only 18.3% were “satisfied.” CONCLUSION: Important challenges were identified in pandemic planning: one quarter of hospitals did not have a plan, few plans were tested, key players were not involved, plans were frequently incomplete, funding was inadequate, and small and rural hospitals were especially disadvantaged.

The use of teledermatology has spread over the last years, especially during the recent SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. Teledermoscopy, an extension of teledermatology, consists of consulting dermoscopic images, also transmitted through smartphones, to remotely diagnose skin tumors or other dermatological diseases. The purpose of this work was to verify the diagnostic validity of images acquired with an inexpensive smartphone microscope (Nurugo(TM)), employing convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify malignant melanoma (MM), melanocytic nevus (MN), and seborrheic keratosis (SK). Methods. The CNN, trained with 600 dermatoscopic images from the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) archive, was tested on three test sets: ISIC images, images acquired with the Nurugo(TM), and images acquired with a conventional dermatoscope. Results. The results obtained, although with some limitations due to the smartphone device and small data set, were encouraging, showing comparable results to the clinical dermatoscope and up to 80% accuracy (out of 10 images, two were misclassified) using the Nurugo(TM) demonstrating how an amateur device can be used with reasonable levels of diagnostic accuracy.

Severe patients are hospitalized and the treatment is done, though they have not been established yet. Currently, however, no treatment is provided for those who are isolated at home or shelter until they get severe symptoms, which will increase the harms to the patients.

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is highly effective, however in patients that present with neurological symptoms the case-fatality ratio is extremely high (>99%). During the last decades several attempts to identify potent and effective antivirals were made. Only a few of these demonstrated improvement in clinical signs in animal studies and none of the trials in humans showed significant efficacy. Here we explore novel opportunities to identify more potent anti-rabies molecules. In particular important progress has been made on antivirals against other Mononegavirales (paramyxoviruses, filoviruses) which should be an impetus to test and optimize these molecules towards anti-rabies virus therapies.

Since other human coronaviruses are known to use co-receptors for viral cell entry, it has been suggested that DPP4 (CD26) could be a potential additional binding target or co-receptor, supported by early molecular docking simulation studies. However, recent biophysical studies have shown this interaction to be very weak. We have conducted detailed molecular docking simulations to predict the potential binding interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and DPP4 and compare them with the interactions observed in the experimentally determined structure of the complex of MERS-CoV with DPP4. Whilst the overall binding mode of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 to DPP4 is predicted to be similar to that observed in the MERS-CoV-DPP4 complex, including a number of equivalent interactions, important differences in the amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV result in substantially weakened interactions with DPP4. This is shown to arise from differences in the predicted proximity, nature and secondary structure at the binding interface on the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. These findings do not support DPP4 being a significant receptor for SARS-CoV-2.","Cameron, Kirsten; Rozano, Lina; Falasca, Marco; Mancera, Ricardo L.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34209788/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22137001,672

A cross-sectional nationwide self-administrative questionnaire survey was conducted in March 2020. The questionnaire included the number of adverse event occurrences in three months, the process of care for patient safety, and other agency characteristics. Of 9979 agencies, 580 questionnaires were returned and 400 were included in the analysis. The number of adverse events in each agency ranged from 0 to 47, and 26.5% of the agencies did not report any adverse event cases. The median occurrence of adverse events was three. In total, 1937 adverse events occurred over three months, of which pressure ulcers were the most frequent (80.5%). Adjusting for the number of patients in a month, the percentage of patients with care-need level 3 or higher was statistically significant.

There is a gap in evidence about expectant and new mothers' experiences with birthing during the pandemic. We sought to describe and understand pregnant and new mothers' lived experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic using authentic birth stories. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a narrative analysis framework, we extracted relevant YouTube birth stories using predetermined search terms and inclusion criteria. Mothers' birth stories were narrated in their second or third trimester or those who had recently given birth during the pandemic. Birth stories were analyzed using an inductive and deductive approach to capture different and salient aspects of the birthing experience. RESULTS: N = 83 birth stories were analyzed. Within these birth stories, four broad themes and 13 subthemes were identified. Key themes included a sense of loss, hospital experiences, experiences with health care providers, and unique experiences during birth and postpartum. The birth stories revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic brought unexpected circumstances, both positive and negative, that had an impact on mothers' overall birthing experience. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Results provided a detailed description of women's lived experience with giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some studies suggest that small air particles facilitate the spread of viruses and also of the new coronavirus, besides the direct person-to-person contagion. However, the effects of the exposure to particulate matter and other contaminants on SARS-CoV-2 has been poorly explored. Here we examined the possible reasons why the new coronavirus differently impacted on Italian regional and provincial populations. With the help of artificial intelligence, we studied the importance of air pollution for mortality and positivity rates of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy. We discovered that among several environmental, health, and socio-economic factors, air pollution and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), as its main component, resulted as the most important predictors of SARS-CoV-2 effects. We also found that the emissions from industries, farms, and road traffic - in order of importance - might be responsible for more than 70% of the deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 nationwide. Given the major contribution played by air pollution (much more important than other health and socio-economic factors, as we discovered), we projected that, with an increase of 5-10% in air pollution, similar future pathogens may inflate the epidemic toll of Italy by 21-32% additional cases, whose 19-28% more positives and 4-14% more deaths. Our findings, demonstrating that fine-particulate (PM2.5) pollutant level is the most important factor to predict SARS-CoV-2 effects that would worsen even with a slight decrease of air quality, highlight that the imperative of productivity before health and environmental protection is, indeed, a short-term/small-minded resolution.","Roberto, Cazzolla Gatti; Alena, Velichevskaya; Andrea, Tateo; Nicola, Amoroso; Alfonso, Monaco",Environ Pollut,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32882464/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.115471; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0269749120361595; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749120361595?v=s5,672

Methods This study respectively enrolled a cohort of surgical patients (patients undergoing surgery in 2018 [group I], 2019[group II], and 2020 [group III]) and a cohort of follow-up patients (patients having follow-up in 2017 [group A], 2018 [group B] and 2019 [group C]) from 13 children hospitals. Results During the COVID-19 era, there was a significant decrease in total surgical volume and a change in case mix in terms of an increase in the proportion of emergency operations. Decrease in migration scale index was correlated to the decrease in both surgical volume (r=0.64, p=0.02) and outpatient visit volume (r=0.61, p=0.03). There was a significantly higher proportion of patients who had follow-up through the internet or phone in group C (26.4% vs. 9.6% in group B and 8.9% in group A; p< 0.0001). There was no statistical difference in death or rehospitalization among the 3 follow-up groups (p=0.49). There was higher parents’ anxiety score (p < 0.0001) and more utilization of telemedicine (p = 0.004) in group C comparing to group A and B. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a considerable decrease in total surgical volume and a change of case mix, which seems to be related to the strict traffic ban.

METHODS: We designed primers specific to the orf1ab and S genes of SARS-CoV-2. Total viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. We optimized the RT-LAMP assay. And, this assay was evaluated for its sensitivity and specificity of detection using real-time turbidity monitoring and visual observation. RESULTS: The primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123 amplified the genes in the shortest times, the mean (±SD) time was 18 ± 1.32 min and 20 ± 1.80 min, respectively, and 63°C was the optimum reaction temperature. The sensitivity was 2×10(1) copies and 2×10(2) copies per reaction with primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123, respectively. This assay showed no cross-reactivity with other 60 respiratory pathogens. To describe the availability of this method in clinical diagnosis, we collected 130 specimens from patients with clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among them, 58 were confirmed to be positive and 72 were negative by RT-LAMP. The sensiticity was 100% (95% CI 92.3% - 100%), specificity 100% (95% CI 93.7% - 100%). This assay detected SARS-CoV-2 in the mean (±SD) time of 26.28 ± 4.48 min and the results can be identified with visual observation. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that we developed a rapid, simple, specific, and sensitive RT-LAMP assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection among clinical samples.

While some are pushing just to get vaccines into arms as quickly as possible, others advocate prioritization in terms of risk. OBJECTIVE Our aim is to use demographic models to show the enormous potential of vaccine risk-prioritization in saving lives. METHODS We develop a simple mathematical model that accounts for the age distribution of the population and of COVID-19 mortality. This model considers only the direct live-savings for those who receive the vaccine, and does not account for possible indirect effects of vaccination. We apply this model to the United States, Japan, and Bangladesh. RESULTS In the United States, we find age-prioritization would reduce deaths during a vaccine campaign by about 93 percent relative to no vaccine and 85 percent relative to age-neutral vaccine distribution. In countries with younger age structures, such as Bangladesh, the benefits of age-prioritization are even greater. CONTRIBUTION For policy makers, our findings give additional support to risk-prioritized allocation of COVID-19 vaccines. For demographers, our results show how the age-structures of the population and of disease mortality combine into an expression of risk concentration that shows the benefits of prioritized allocation.

DESIGN: Test negative case-control study. SETTING: Community testing for covid-19 in England. PARTICIPANTS: 156 930 adults aged 70 years and older who reported symptoms of covid-19 between 8 December 2020 and 19 February 2021 and were successfully linked to vaccination data in the National Immunisation Management System. INTERVENTIONS: Vaccination with BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1-S. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were polymerase chain reaction confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, admissions to hospital for covid-19, and deaths with covid-19. RESULTS: Participants aged 80 years and older vaccinated with BNT162b2 before 4 January 2021 had a higher odds of testing positive for covid-19 in the first nine days after vaccination (odds ratio up to 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.77), indicating that those initially targeted had a higher underlying risk of infection. Vaccine effectiveness was therefore compared with the baseline post-vaccination period. Vaccine effects were noted 10 to 13 days after vaccination, reaching a vaccine effectiveness of 70% (95% confidence interval 59% to 78%), then plateauing. From 14 days after the second dose a vaccination effectiveness of 89% (85% to 93%) was found compared with the increased baseline risk. Participants aged 70 years and older vaccinated from 4 January (when ChAdOx1-S delivery commenced) had a similar underlying risk of covid-19 to unvaccinated individuals. With BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness reached 61% (51% to 69%) from 28 to 34 days after vaccination, then plateaued. With ChAdOx1-S, effects were seen from 14 to 20 days after vaccination, reaching an effectiveness of 60% (41% to 73%) from 28 to 34 days, increasing to 73% (27% to 90%) from day 35 onwards. On top of the protection against symptomatic disease, a further 43% (33% to 52%) reduced risk of emergency hospital admission and 51% (37% to 62%) reduced risk of death was observed in those who had received one dose of BNT162b2. Participants who had received one dose of ChAdOx1-S had a further 37% (3% to 59%) reduced risk of emergency hospital admission. Follow-up was insufficient to assess the effect of ChAdOx1-S on mortality. Combined with the effect against symptomatic disease, a single dose of either vaccine was about 80% effective at preventing admission to hospital with covid-19 and a single dose of BNT162b2 was 85% effective at preventing death with covid-19. CONCLUSION: Vaccination with either one dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1-S was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic covid-19 in older adults, and with further protection against severe disease. Both vaccines showed similar effects. Protection was maintained for the duration of follow-up (>6 weeks). A second dose of BNT162b2 was associated with further protection against symptomatic disease.

617706,Responding to natural disasters vs. disease outbreaks: Do emergency medical service providers have different views?,2019-12-07,"Around 60% of pheasants released for shooting in the UK, an estimated 21 million birds, do not end up at their intended fate: being shot. This constitutes wastage, raising economic, environmental and ethical questions. We review what is known of the fates of released pheasants and consider why they do not directly contribute to the numbers harvested. We focus on four main explanations: predation, disease, starvation and dispersal, and highlight other important causes of mortality. For each explanation, we attempt to attribute levels of loss and identify timings or conditions when such losses may be heaviest. We review factors that exacerbate losses and methods available to mitigate them. Opportunities for amelioration may arise at all stages of the rearing and release of pheasants and involve changes to the conditions under which eggs are produced, the way young pheasants are reared or the management of the environment into which they are released. We found few studies investigating impacts of post-release management techniques on pheasant survival outside of the breeding season within a UK context. We found that a number of less commonly deployed practices focusing on early-life, pre-release management may improve survival. Given the scale of pheasant releasing in the UK, even improvements in survival of 1% would mean that ~ 350,000 fewer birds die of natural causes. Complementing current post-release management with proven novel pre-release management interventions could reduce the number of pheasants required for release, whilst maintaining current shooting levels. Lowering release numbers would lower financial costs, benefit the environment and reduce some ethical concerns over the release and shooting of reared pheasants.

619133,COVID-19 et adaptation des dispositifs de suivi psychologique en réanimation médicale,2021-05-31,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading all over the world. Health systems around the globe have to deal with decreased capabilities and exhausted resources because of the surge of patients. The need to identify COVID-19 patients to achieve a timely opportunity to treat and isolate them is an ongoing challenge for health care professionals everywhere. A lack of testing capabilities forces clinicians to make the crucial initial decision on the basis of clinical findings and routine diagnostic laboratory test. This article reviews the current literature and presents a new adapted protocol for diagnosing and triaging COVID-19 patients. A special emphasis lies on the stepwise approach guiding the medical provider to a triage decision that is suitable for the individual patient and the situation of the local medical treatment facility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: On March 30, 2020, a PubMed based literature research on COVID-19 following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines was performed. A diagnostic and triage tool for COVID-19 was designed based on the major findings in the reviewed literature. RESULTS: After a selection process, focusing on the topics “epidemiology,” “clinical characteristics,” and “diagnostic tools,” 119 out of a total amount of 1,241 publications were selected to get an overview of the growing evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The designed Early Recognition and Triage Tool enables the medical provider to use the applicable modules of the protocol for capabilities of the local setting to get the most appropriate diagnostic and triage done. The tool should give guidance for the initial approach until specific testing for the COVID-19 virus is available.","Jänig, Christoph; Gurney, Jennifer M; Froklage, Roger; Groth, Robin; Wirth, Christine; van de Krol, Hendrik; Schmidbauer, Willi; Güsgen, Christoph",Mil Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33108437/; https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usaa296,672
619286,Aspectos básicos del COVID-19 para el manejo desde Atención Primaria,2020-12-26,"Introduction: SARS-COV-2 pandemic has infected approximately 20 million people worldwide and more than 700.000 fatalities have been reported. Patients with malignant hematological diseases are at particular risk for unfavorable outcomes, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for mechanical ventilation (MV) and death. There is paucity of data of the outcome of cancer patients with COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries. GELL is a collaborative network of hematological centers in 13 countries in Latin America. In this retrospective study, we aimed to look at the outcome of lymphoma patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Latin America. Methods: This is a retrospective study including patients with a diagnosis of lymphoma and COVID-19 infection. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma were excluded from the analysis. COVID-19 diagnosis was done by RT-PCR in all but 3 patients, in whom the diagnosis was done by serology. Active disease was defined as patients with detected disease in any setting (prior to therapy, relapse) or patients currently on treatment. Survival curves were plotted using Kaplan Meier method. Results: A total of 117 patients were available for analysis. Median age was 60 years old, and 44% of patients had at least one comorbidity, including 32% with hypertension, 17% with obesity, 11% with cardiovascular disease and 17% with diabetes. Most patients had aggressive lymphomas (67%), including 46% of patients with diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Follicular lymphomas was observed in 13% of patients and Hodgkin's lymphoma in 10% of patients. 84% of patients had active disease, and 70% of patients were currently on treatment. With a median follow up of 17 days from COVID-19 diagnosis, 78% were admitted to Hospital, 30% needed ICU support, and 27% needed MV. Importantly, 26% of patients died, most of them within 20 days from diagnosis (Fig. 1). There was no relation between active disease (p=0.23), current treatment (p=0.65) or use of monoclonal antibodies (p=0.24) with death. COVID-19 treatment data was available in 107 patients, and 72 of them received any treatment, being steroids, the most common treatment used (n=59). Conclusion: We confirm the dismal prognosis of patients with hematological malignancies and COVID-19 infection. In our cohort of Latin America patients with lymphoma and COVID-19, 26% of patients died with a median follow up of 17 days. No impact of current treatment or use of monoclonal antibodies were observed.

Quantile autoregressive lagged (QARDL) method was employed during the study period of 1990–2015. The study findings confirm that under long-run estimation, GDP and PPPI are causing more environmental abatement in the form of CO2 emission and haze pollution like PM2.5. The factors like ecological innovation and GDP2 are playing their role towards lowering the CO2 emission and PM2.5 under different quantiles. Furthermore, it is observed that under short-run estimation, past values of the carbon emissions and PM2.5 have their significant and positive relationship with their current values. Besides, the findings through Wald test estimation confirm that parameter constancy of the speed of adjustment parameter is rejected at 1% significance level for the CO2 emission and haze pollution like PM2.5 in USA.

Their activation depends on net signaling mediated via inhibitory and activating receptors that interact with specific ligands displayed on the surfaces of target cells. The CD94/NKG2C heterodimer is one of the NK activating receptors and performs its function by interacting with the trimeric ligand comprised of the HLA-E/β2m/nonameric peptide complex. Here, simulations of the all-atom multi-microsecond molecular dynamics in five immune complexes provide atomistic insights into the receptor–ligand molecular recognition, as well as the molecular events that facilitate the NK cell activation. We identify NKG2C, the HLA-E(α2) domain, and the nonameric peptide as the key elements involved in the molecular machinery of signal transduction via an intertwined hydrogen bond network. Overall, the study addresses the complex intricacies that are necessary to understand the mechanisms of the innate immune system.","Prašnikar, Eva; Perdih, Andrej; Borišek, Jure",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34206395/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22136670,672

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of controlled clinical trials assessing treatment with convalescent plasma for hospitalized patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The outcomes were mortality, clinical improvement, and ventilation requirement. RESULTS: A total of 51 studies were retrieved from the databases. Five articles were finally included in the data extraction and qualitative and quantitative synthesis of results. The overall risk of bias in the reviewed articles was established at low-risk only in two trials. The meta-analysis suggests that there is no benefit of convalescent plasma compared with standard care or placebo in reducing the overall mortality and the ventilation requirement. However, there could be a benefit for the clinical improvement in patients treated with plasma. CONCLUSION: Current results led to assume that the convalescent plasma transfusion cannot reduce the mortality or ventilation requirement in hospitalized patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. More controlled clinical trials conducted with methodologies that ensure a low risk of bias are still needed.

However, most laboratory diagnostics for COVID-19, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), are expensive, time-consuming, and require highly trained professional operators. On the other hand, the lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) is a simpler, cheaper device that can be operated by unskilled personnel easily. Unfortunately, the current technique has some limitations, mainly inaccuracy in detection. This review article aims to highlight recent advances in novel lateral flow technologies for detecting SARS-CoV-2 as well as innovative approaches to achieve highly sensitive and specific point-of-care testing.

Although tests to detect anti -SARS -CoV-2 antibodies have been developed, their sensitivity and specificity in hemodialysis patients have not been previously assessed. Methods: As part of a quality improvement (QI) initiative, nasopharyngeal swabs and predialysis blood samples were collected on the same day from adult patients receiving routine hemodialysis care at clinics managed by a large dialysis organization in the greater Miami, Florida region (23 - 30 Apr 2020). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for SARS -CoV -2 and chemiluminescence immunoassays for anti -SARS -CoV2 antibodies were performed according to manufacturer-specified protocols. Results: Of 715 participants in the QI initiative, 38 had symptomatology consistent with COVID -19 prior to or during the initiative. Among these, COVID -19 was PCR -confirmed in 14 and ruled out in 20, with the remaining 4 being inconclusive. Among the 34 patients with known COVID -19 status, the sensitivity and specificity of the antibody test were 57.1% and 85.0% when either antibody was considered. The remaining 677 patients had no record of symptoms consistent with COVID -19, nor any known exposure. Of these, 38 patients (5.6%) tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Conclusions: The operational characteristics of the laboratory-based antibody test make it sufficient to rule in, but not rule out, SARS -CoV -2 infection in the appropriate clinical circumstance. A substantial proportion of dialysis patients may have had asymptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection.","Cohen, D. E.; Marlowe, G.; Contreras, G.; Sosa, M. A.; Mendoza, J.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study involving 145 consecutive patients with specimens positive by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the matrix and new H1 genes was conducted. RESULTS: The nontreated and oseltamivir-treated patients were comparable in their viral load at presentation, demography, and the presenting symptoms. No correlation was observed between viral load with age and number of symptoms. Viral load of nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was significantly lower in treated than in nontreated patients at day 5 after symptom onset. When oseltamivir was initiated ≤ 2 days after symptom onset, a greater rate of viral load reduction in NPA of treated patients than that of nontreated patients was observed (−0.638 [95% CI, −0.809 to −0.466] vs −0.409 [95% CI, −0.663 to −0.185] log(10) copies/mL/d post-symptom onset), and the viral load was undetectable at day 6 after oseltamivir initiation, which was 1 day earlier than that of those whose treatment was initiated > 2 days of symptom onset. The viral load was inversely correlated with concomitant absolute lymphocyte count in nontreated patients (Pearson correlation coefficient [r] = −0.687, P = .001) and treated patients (Pearson r = −0.365, P < .001). Resolution of fever was 1.4 days later in nontreated than treated patients (P = .012) CONCLUSIONS: The natural viral load profile was described.

METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were electronically searched to identify original studies containing the rate of asymptomatic infection in COVID‐19 patients before 20 May 2020. Then mate‐analysis was conducted using R version 3.6.2. RESULTS: A total of 50155 patients from 41 studies with confirmed COVID‐19 were included. The pooled percentage of asymptomatic infection is 15.6% (95% CI: 10.1%‐23.0%). Ten included studies contain the number of pre‐symptomatic patients, who were asymptomatic at screening point and developed symptoms during follow‐up. The pooled percentage of pre‐symptomatic infection among 180 initially asymptomatic patients is 48.9% (95% CI: 31.6‐66.2%). The pooled proportion of asymptomatic infection among 1152 COVID‐19 children from 11 studies is 27.7% (95% CI: 16.4–42.7%), which is much higher than patients from all aged groups. Abnormal CT features are common in asymptomatic COVID‐19 infection. For 36 patients from 4 studies that CT results were available, 15 (41.7%) patients had bilateral involvement and 14 (38.9%) had unilateral involvement in CT results. Reduced white blood cell count, increased lactate dehydrogenase, and increased C‐reactive protein were also recorded. CONCLUSION: About 15.6% of confirmed COVID‐19 patients are asymptomatic. Nearly half of the patients with no symptoms at detection time will develop symptoms later. Children are likely to have a higher proportion of asymptomatic infection than adults. Asymptomatic COVID‐19 patients could have abnormal laboratory and radiational manifestations which can be used as screening strategies to identify asymptomatic infection.

An alliance of collaborative on-ground water quality monitoring (Project 25) and technologically driven digital application development (Digiscape GBR) projects were formulated to provide data that highlighted the contribution of a network of Australian sugar cane farmers, amongst other sources, to nutrient runoff. This environmental data and subsequent information were extended to the farming community through scientist-led feedback sessions and the development of specialised digital technology (1622™WQ) that help build an understanding of the nutrient movements, in this case nitrogen, such that farmers might think about and eventually act to alter their fertilizer application practices. This paper reflects on a socio-environmental sustainability challenge that emerged during this case study, by utilising the nascent concept of digi-grasping. We highlight the importance of the entire agricultural knowledge and advice network being part of an innovation journey to increase the utility of digital agricultural technologies developed to increase overall sustainability. We develop the digi-MAST analytical framework, which explores modes of being and doing in the digital world, ranging from ‘the everyday mystery of the digital world (M)’, through digital ‘awareness (A)’, digitally ‘sparked’ being/s (S), and finally the ability of individuals and/or groups to ‘transform (T)’ utilising digital technologies and human imaginations. Our digi-MAST framework allows us to compare agricultural actors, in this case, to understand present modes of digi-grasping to help determine the resources and actions likely to be required to achieve impact from the development of various forms of digital technological research outputs.","Fielke, Simon J.; Taylor, Bruce M.; Jakku, Emma; Mooij, Martijn; Stitzlein, Cara; Fleming, Aysha; Thorburn, Peter J.; Webster, Anthony J.; Davis, Aaron; Vilas, Maria P.",Sustain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33425035/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-020-00885-9,672

Concerns have been raised over whether currently authorized lateral flow tests are sufficiently sensitive and specific to detect enough infections to impact transmission whilst minimizing unnecessary isolation of false positives. These concerns have often been illustrated using simple, textbook calculations of positivity rates and positive predictive value assuming fixed values for sensitivity, specificity and prevalence. However, we argue that evaluating repeated testing strategies requires the consideration of three additional factors: new infections continue to arise depending on the incidence rate, isolating positive individuals reduces prevalence in the tested population, and each infected individual is tested multiple times during their infection course. We provide a simple mathematical model with an online interface to illustrate how these three factors impact test positivity rates and the number of isolating individuals over time. These results highlight the potential pitfalls of using inappropriate textbook-style calculations to evaluate statistics arising from repeated testing strategies during an epidemic.

However, his passion for the complexity of the biochemical origin of chlorophylls drove a career in basic sciences which extended into applied areas of environmentally friendly pesticides and treatment for skin cancer. He was a philanthropist; in retirement, he founded the Rebeiz Foundation for Basic Research which recognized excellence and lifetime achievements of selected top scientists in the general area of photosynthesis research. His life history, scientific breakthroughs, and community service hold important lessons for the field.","Govindjee, Govindjee; Briskin, Donald P.; Benning, Christoph; Daniell, Henry; Kolossov, Vladimir; Scheer, Hugo; Rebeiz, Mark",Photosynth Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11120-020-00750-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32458186/,672

The viral spike protein plays pivotal roles in mediating receptor-recognition and membrane-fusion, and is therefore a key factor involved in viral pathogenesis and inter-species transmission. Here we reported the structural and functional characterization of the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) from DcCoV UAE-HKU23 (HKU23-NTD). Via mucin-binding assays, we showed that HKU23-NTD is able to bind sugars. We further solved the structure of HKU23-NTD, performed structure-guided mutagenesis and successfully located the potential sugar-binding pockets in the structure. Furthermore, via comparison of available betaCoV NTD structures, we demonstrated that betaCoV NTDs contain a conserved β-sandwich core, but exhibit variant folds in the peripheral elements located in the top-ceiling region and on the lateral side. While showing different compositions and structures, these peripheral elements are topologically equivalent β-sandwich-core insertions, highlighting a divergent evolution process for betaCoVs to form different lineages.","Cheng, Yanwei; He, Bin; Yang, Jing; Ye, Fei; Lin, Sheng; Yang, Fanli; Chen, Zimin; Chen, Zhujun; Cao, Yu; Lu, Guangwen",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31279241/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682219301631; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2019.06.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682219301631,672

Infection is usually initiated after inhalation of virus-contaminated rodent excreta. In addition to the zoonotic infection route, growing evidence suggests person-to-person transmission of Andes virus. For this reason, we studied whether saliva from HFRS patients contained hantavirus. During an outbreak in northern Sweden of nephropathia epidemica (NE), a milder form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, we collected saliva and plasma from 14 hospitalized NE patients with verified Puumala virus (PUUV) infection. PUUV RNA was detected in saliva from 10 patients (range 1,530–121,323 PUUV RNA copies/mL) by quantitative reverse transcription–PCR. The PUUV S-segment sequences from saliva and plasma of the same patients were identical. Our data show that hantavirus RNA could be detected in human saliva several days after onset of disease symptoms and raise the question whether interhuman transmission of hantavirus may occur through saliva.","Pettersson, Lisa; Klingström, Jonas; Hardestam, Jonas; Lundkvist, Åke; Ahlm, Clas; Evander, Magnus",Emerg Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.3201/eid1403.071242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18325254/,672

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are on the front line against the virus and have been highly exposed to pandemic-related stressors, but there are limited data on their psychological involvement for a large sample in Italy. AIMS: To investigate the prevalence of anxiety, distress and burnout in HCWs of North-West Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to detect potential psychosocial factors associated with their emotional response. METHOD: This cross-sectional, survey-based study enrolled 797 HCWs. Participants completed the Impact of Event Scale – Revised, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory – Form Y and the Maslach Burnout Inventory; demographic, family and work characteristics were also collected. Global psychological outcome, differences among professions and independent factors associated with worst psychological outcome were assessed. RESULTS: Almost a third of the sample had severe state anxiety and distress, high emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation, and low personal accomplishment. Distress was higher in women and nurses, whereas depersonalisation was higher in men. Family division, increased workload, job changes and frequent contact with COVID-19 were associated with worst psychological outcome. Trait anxiety was associated with significantly higher risk for developing state anxiety, distress and burnout. CONCLUSIONS: An elevated psychological burden related to the COVID-19 pandemic was observed in HCWs of North-West Italy. The identification of family and work characteristics and a psychological pre-existing condition as factors associated with worst psychological outcome may help provide a tailored, preventive, organisational and psychological approach in counteracting the psychological effects of future pandemics.","Naldi, Andrea; Vallelonga, Fabrizio; Di Liberto, Alessandra; Cavallo, Roberto; Agnesone, Monica; Gonella, Marco; Sauta, Maria Domenica; Lochner, Piergiorgio; Tondo, Giacomo; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Botto, Rossana; Leombruni, Paolo",BJPsych Open,https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33407989/,672

Advancement of sensor technologies has allowed the electroencephalography (EEG) devices to be portable and used in real-time to monitor mental health. However, real-time monitoring is not often practical in workplace environments with complex operations such as kindergarten, firefighting and offshore facilities. Integrating the EEG with virtual reality (VR) that emulates workplace conditions can be a tool to assess and monitor mental health of adults within their working environment. This paper evaluates the mental states induced when performing a stressful task in a VR-based offshore environment. The theta, alpha and beta frequency bands are analysed to assess changes in mental states due to physical discomfort, stress and concentration. During the VR trials, mental states of discomfort and disorientation are observed with the drop of theta activity, whilst the stress induced from the conditional tasks is reflected in the changes of low-alpha and high-beta activities. The deflection of frontal alpha asymmetry from negative to positive direction reflects the learning effects from emotion-focus to problem-solving strategies adopted to accomplish the VR task. This study highlights the need for an integrated VR-EEG system in workplace settings as a tool to monitor and assess mental health of working adults.","Abu Hasan, Rumaisa; Sulaiman, Shahida; Ashykin, Nur Nabila; Abdullah, Mohd Nasir; Hafeez, Yasir; Ali, Syed Saad Azhar",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21144885; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34300624/,672

The safe and non-ionizing nature of LUS drew attention, particularly for pregnant women. This study aimed to contribute to the interpretation of LUS findings in pregnant women for the obstetricians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LUS was performed to pregnant women suspected of or diagnosed as having Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the first 24 hours of admission. Fourteen areas (3 posterior, 2 lateral, and 2 anterior) were scanned per patient for at least 10 seconds along the indicated anatomical landmarks. The scan was performed in supine, right-sided and left-sided positions, respectively. Each area was given a score between 0 and 3 according to the specific pattern. RESULTS: In this study, 21 still images and 21 videoclips that enabled dynamic and real-time evaluation were provided. Pleural line assessment, physiologic A-lines, pathologic B-lines, light beam pattern, white lung pattern, and specific patterns for quick recognition and evaluation are described. CONCLUSION: The potential advantages and limitations of LUS and its areas of use for obstetricians are discussed. LUS is a promising supplementary imaging tool during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. It is easy to perform and may be feasible in the hands of obstetricians after a brief didactic course.

660120,Bringing Medicine from Pakistan and Self-Medication Among Pakistani Mothers in New Zealand,2021-06-05,"Ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) are highly unstable and susceptible to rearrangement due to their repetitive nature and active transcriptional status. Sequestration of rDNA in the nucleolus suppresses uncontrolled recombination. However, broken repeats must be first released to the nucleoplasm to allow repair by homologous recombination. Nucleolar release of broken rDNA repeats is conserved from yeast to humans, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are currently unknown. Here we show that DNA damage induces phosphorylation of the CLIP-cohibin complex, releasing membrane-tethered rDNA from the nucleolus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Downstream of phosphorylation, SUMOylation of CLIP-cohibin is recognized by Ufd1 via its SUMO-interacting motif, which targets the complex for disassembly through the Cdc48/p97 chaperone. Consistent with a conserved mechanism, UFD1L depletion in human cells impairs rDNA release. The dynamic and regulated assembly and disassembly of the rDNA-tethering complex is therefore a key determinant of nucleolar rDNA release and genome integrity.","Capella, Matías; Mandemaker, Imke K.; Martín Caballero, Lucía; den Brave, Fabian; Pfander, Boris; Ladurner, Andreas G.; Jentsch, Stefan; Braun, Sigurd",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25205-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34389719/,672
661372,Human Rights in Chilean Social Work: Lessons from Chile to Prepare Social Work Students for Human Rights Practice,2020-11-21,"BACKGROUND: The measures taken to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, such as the lockdown in Italy, do impact psychological health; yet, less is known about their effect on cognitive functioning. The transactional theory of stress predicts reciprocal influences between perceived stress and cognitive performance. However, the effects of a period of stress due to social isolation on spatial cognition and exploration have been little examined. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible effects and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on spatial cognition tasks, particularly those concerning spatial exploration, and the physiological leftward bias known as pseudoneglect. A right-hemisphere asymmetry for spatial attention processes crucially contributes to pseudoneglect. Other evidence indicates a predominantly right-hemisphere activity in stressful situations. We also analyzed the effects of lockdown on coping strategies, which typically show an opposite pattern of hemispheric asymmetry, favoring the left hemisphere. If so, then pseudoneglect should increase during the lockdown and be negatively correlated with the efficacy of coping strategies. METHODS: One week before the start of the lockdown due to COVID-19 in Italy (T1), we had collected data from a battery of behavioral tests including tasks of peri-personal spatial cognition. During the quarantine period, from late April to early May 2020 (T2), we repeated the testing sessions with a subgroup of the same participants (47 right-handed students, mean age = 20, SD = 1.33). At both testing sessions, participants performed digitized neuropsychological tests, including a Cancellation task, Radial Arm Maze task, and Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices. Participants also completed a newly developed COVID-19 Student Stress Scale, based on transactional models of stress, and the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced—New Italian Version (COPE-NIV) to assess coping orientation. RESULTS: The tendency to start cancelation from a left-sided item, to explore first a left-sided arm of the maze, and to choose erroneous response items on the left side of the page on Raven’s matrices increased from T1 to T2. The degree of pseudoneglect increment positively correlated with perceived stress and negatively correlated with Positive Attitude and Problem-Solving COPE-NIV subscales. CONCLUSION: Lockdown-related stress may have contributed to increase leftward bias during quarantine through a greater activation of the right hemisphere. On the other hand, pseudoneglect was decreased for better coping participants, perhaps as a consequence of a more balanced hemispheric activity in these individuals.","Somma, Federica; Bartolomeo, Paolo; Vallone, Federica; Argiuolo, Antonietta; Cerrato, Antonio; Miglino, Orazio; Mandolesi, Laura; Zurlo, Maria Clelia; Gigliotta, Onofrio",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33746815/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.573846,672

Many critical scholars have celebrated how South Korean authorities have contained the virus in ways that ignore power relations. The government coordinated its pandemic response by expanding its formidable surveillance technologies for tracing, tracking, and mining every activity of ordinary citizens. State managers produced powerful images of the government, in Confucian fashion, protecting the public from a dangerous threat. I will connect these performances of power with an examination of how authorities harnessed its pandemic response to private capital. South Korea’s reaction to COVID-19 does represent a positive alternative to the dominant form of oligarchic rule that prevails in Euro-American societies. The governing elite deployed state power in ways that used this conjuncture to continue previous patterns of domination that have continuously expanded surveillance, extending techniques for the extraction of vital data for commercial and political purposes. Rather than celebrate the South Korean authorities, we should analyze how COVID-19 response has deepened South Korean society's social contradictions.","Baca, George",Dialect Anthropol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10624-020-09609-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32863536/,672
668968,Online-rotation in paediatrics – digital live-interaction with children,2020-12-03,"Many countries established strong population lockdowns as a response to the pandemic of COVID-19 in 2020. While these measures proved efficient in stopping the spreading of the virus, they also introduced collateral effects in the economies of these countries. We report in this work that the imprints in mobility of both the lockdown and post-lockdown on the Spanish population are measurable by means of the daily radius of gyration using mobile phone data. We cross mobility with economic data segmented by average salary per person so as to find large inequalities between low- and high-income populations. Indeed, low-income populations typically show a 17% higher radius of gyration than high-income ones during pre-lockdown (8.1 km vs. 6.9 km). However, this relative difference grows to a maximum during lock-down (3.3 km vs. 900 m) since most of the essential workers (carriers, nurses, supermarket cashiers, farmworkers, etc.) belong to the first segment. Post-lockdown shows reversed inequality in the weeks during summer vacations as high-income populations multiplied their pre-lockdown radius by 70% as a rebound effect driven by leisure, while low-income populations recovered their normal pre-lockdown radius. This period is correlated with an extraordinary increase in the number of new Covid cases, which stabilized after the holyday weeks once at the so-called new normal. We find that this new normal emphasizes the pre-lockdown inequalities in mobility between low- and high-income population, increasing the inequality up to a 47%. These results show the relevance of devising measures that could account for potential collateral inequalities.","Hernando, A.; Mateo, D.; Barrios, I.; Plastino, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.26.20219709v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.26.20219709,672

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between mask usage, neighborhood racial segregation, and racial disparities in COVID-19 deaths. METHODS: We used linear regression to assess whether the racial/ethnic composition of deaths and residential segregation predicted Americans’ decisions to wear masks in July 2020. RESULTS: After controlling for mask mandates, mask usage increased when White death rates relative to Black and Hispanic rates increased. CONCLUSIONS: Mask wearing may be shaped by an insensitivity to Black and Hispanic deaths and a corresponding unwillingness to engage in health-protective behaviors. The broader history of systemic racism and residential segregation may also explain why white Americans do not wear masks or perceive themselves to be at risk when communities of color are disproportionately affected by COVID-19.","Franz, Berkeley; Milner, Adrienne; Braddock, II Jomills Henry",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34269992/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-021-01097-2,672

Currently, the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in 2019 (estimated mortality rate 10%). The virus can pass to the faeces of some patients, as was the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses. This suggests that apart from the airborne (droplets and aerosols) and person-to-person (including fomites) transmission, the faecal–oral route of transmission could also be possible for HCoVs. In this eventuality, natural water bodies could act as a virus reservoir of infection. Here, the temporospatial migration and attenuation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in municipal wastewater, the receiving environment, and drinking water, is evaluated, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in the South African setting. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was identified in raw wastewater influent but was below the detection limit in the latter treatment stages. This suggests that the virus decays from as early as primary treatment and this could be attributed to wastewater's hydraulic retention time (2–4 h), composition, and more importantly temperature (>25 °C). Therefore, the probability of SARS-CoV-2 virus transportation in water catchments, in the eventuality that the virus remains infective in wastewater, appears to be low in the South African setting. Finally, catchment-wide monitoring offers a snapshot of the status of the catchment in relation to contagious viruses and can play a pivotal role in informing the custodians and downstream water users of potential risks embedded in water bodies.","Masindi, Vhahangwele; Foteinis, Spyros; Nduli, Kefilwe; Akinwekomi, Vhahangwele",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721043710?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34388648/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721043710,672

Currently, there is no effective therapy for the disease. While the administration of ribavirin does not improve the case fatality rate or viral load in patient blood, it can inhibit viral infection in vitro. METHODS: Vero cells were pre-treated with interferons (IFNs) α, β, and γ alone and in combination with ribavirin drugs and inoculated with SFTS virus. Three days later, supernatants were harvested and subjected to virus titration. An unpaired t-test was used for statistical analysis of the drugs’ effects. RESULTS: While the effects of IFNγ at high concentrations were slightly weaker than those of the other IFNs, all IFNs showed dose-dependent inhibitory effects. The combined usage of IFNs with ribavirin at 90 % effective concentrations showed large inhibitory effects, with over a 3 log(10) reduction in viral titers.

European research on anxiety and stress among hospital workers during the pandemic is limited. This study aimed to describe the anxiety levels of Finnish hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The multidimensional, cross-sectional survey was distributed to all hospital staff working at two Finnish specialized medical care centres in the spring of 2020 (n = 1,995). The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale was used to measure the workers’ anxiety. RESULTS: The total mean GAD-7 score was 4.88, indicating normal anxiety levels. However, 30% (n = 1,079) of the respondents had mild, 10% (n = 194) moderate and 5% (n = 88) severe anxiety. Key risk factors were young age, working in a university hospital, problems in cooperation between co-workers, difficulty concentrating at work, a health-threatening physical and psychological workload, and a fear of being infected at work. CONCLUSION: Hospital staff experienced a variety of work-related stress and anxiety issues that should be visible to hospital administrators and policymakers alike. The anxiety is independent of whether the worker is directly involved in caring for or in any way coming into contact with COVID-19 patients. KEY MESSAGE: Fifty-five percent of hospital staff have normal anxiety levels. The remaining workers may need targeted support interventions, and a smaller proportion (15%) are in danger of developing longer-term problems affecting their well-being. The anxiety experienced by hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic is more severe than that of the population on average. If the pandemic continues, the well-being of hospital staff may be widely threatened. Despite the different geographical locations and COVID-19 situations, hospital workers in Finland and China had similar anxiety levels. The anxiety is independent of whether staff are working in the front line of managing the COVID-19 pandemic or of the number of covid-19 patients admitted to the hospital. The hospital workers felt anxiety because they were facing a new situation which causes changes in their work and daily routine. Health care employers should engage in long-term follow-up as regards the personnel’s recovery from the burden caused by the pandemic and from work in general. It is necessary to make easily attainable, flexibly delivered and cost-effective treatment interventions for anxiety available to hospital staff.","Mattila, Elina; Peltokoski, Jaana; Neva, Marko H.; Kaunonen, Marja; Helminen, Mika; Parkkila, Anna-Kaisa",Annals of medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33350869/; https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2020.1862905,672

This report is of a 17-year-old girl with a history of marijuana use who presented with pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium and was found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on hospital admission by Abbott ID NOW testing. CASE REPORT: A 17-year-old girl presented to the emergency room with a 3-day history of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting and a 1-day history of diarrhea. She had a history of daily marijuana use and lived with her grandmother who was presumed to be positive for COVID-19, based on symptoms. Her admission laboratory results were unremarkable except for pyuria, which was suspicious for urinary tract infection. The patient’s nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Owing to abdominal pain, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained, which was concerning for pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium. A CT scan of the thorax confirmed the findings. A contrast-enhanced barium esophagogram was performed and was unremarkable. The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for observation and supportive care.

Here, we designed and evaluated two single-tube nested (STN) real-time RT-PCR assays, targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp/Hel and N genes. Both STN assays had a low limit of detection and did not cross react with other human coronaviruses and respiratory viruses. Using 213 initial respiratory specimens from suspected COVID-19 patients, the sensitivity of both the STN COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and the STN COVID-19-N assays was 100% (99/99), while that of the comparator non-nested N assay was 95% (94/99). Among 108 follow-up specimens from confirmed COVID-19 patients who tested negative by the non-nested COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay, 28 (25.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by the STN COVID-19-RdRp/Hel or the STN COVID-19-N assay. To evaluate the performance of our novel STN assays in pooled specimens, we created four sample pools, with each pool consisting of one low positive specimen and 49 negative specimens. While the non-nested COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was positive in only one of four sample pools (25%), both of the STN assays were positive in two of four samples pools (50%).

Their boosted sensitivity offers advantages in non-traditional COVID-19 testing algorithms such as saliva screening and pooled sample screening during massive screening.","Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan; Sridhar, Siddharth; Leung, Kit-Hang; Ng, Anthony Chin-Ki; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Tsang, Owen Tak-Yin; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21165674; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32784770/,672
675984,Epidemiology of COVID-19 in Mexico: From the 27th of February to the 30th of April 2020(),2020-07-09,"INTRODUCTION: Pandemic A/H1N1/2009 influenza causes severe lower respiratory complications in rare cases. The association between host immune responses and clinical outcome in severe cases is unknown. METHODS: We utilized gene expression, cytokine profiles and generation of antibody responses following hospitalization in 19 critically ill patients with primary pandemic A/H1N1/2009 influenza pneumonia for identifying host immune responses associated with clinical outcome. Ingenuity pathway analysis 8.5 (IPA) (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA) was used to select, annotate and visualize genes by function and pathway (gene ontology). IPA analysis identified those canonical pathways differentially expressed (P < 0.05) between comparison groups. Hierarchical clustering of those genes differentially expressed between groups by IPA analysis was performed using BRB-Array Tools v.3.8.1. RESULTS: The majority of patients were characterized by the presence of comorbidities and the absence of immunosuppressive conditions. pH1N1 specific antibody production was observed around day 9 from disease onset and defined an early period of innate immune response and a late period of adaptive immune response to the virus. The most severe patients (n = 12) showed persistence of viral secretion. Seven of the most severe patients died. During the late phase, the most severe patient group had impaired expression of a number of genes participating in adaptive immune responses when compared to less severe patients. These genes were involved in antigen presentation, B-cell development, T-helper cell differentiation, CD28, granzyme B signaling, apoptosis and protein ubiquitination. Patients with the poorest outcomes were characterized by proinflammatory hypercytokinemia, along with elevated levels of immunosuppressory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-1ra) in serum. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest an impaired development of adaptive immunity in the most severe cases of pandemic influenza, leading to an unremitting cycle of viral replication and innate cytokine-chemokine release. Interruption of this deleterious cycle may improve disease outcome.","Bermejo-Martin, Jesus F; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Rello, Jordi; Antón, Andres; Almansa, Raquel; Xu, Luoling; Lopez-Campos, Guillermo; Pumarola, Tomás; Ran, Longsi; Ramirez, Paula; Banner, David; Cheuk Ng, Derek; Socias, Lorenzo; Loza, Ana; Andaluz, David; Maravi, Enrique; Gómez-Sánchez, Maria J; Gordón, Mónica; Gallegos, Maria C; Fernandez, Victoria; Aldunate, Sara; León, Cristobal; Merino, Pedro; Blanco, Jesús; Martin-Sanchez, Fernando; Rico, Lucia; Varillas, David; Iglesias, Veronica; Marcos, Maria Ángeles; Gandía, Francisco; Bobillo, Felipe; Nogueira, Begoña; Rojo, Silvia; Resino, Salvador; Castro, Carmen; Ortiz de Lejarazu, Raul; Kelvin, David",Crit Care,https://doi.org/10.1186/cc9259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20840779/,672

Most of the hospital setups worldwide have put telemedicine into practice ever since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed at assessing the effectiveness of Tele-otolaryngology (TO) at a tertiary care centre during the pandemic lockdown. A validated patient feedback questionnaire was developed and distributed to 2577 patients who utilised the TO mobile health service at our institute. Patient feedback-based assessment of TO effectiveness during COVID-19 lockdown was carried out. The validated questionnaire in English and Hindi was statistically robust with Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.808 and 0.886 respectively. 1751 patients completed their feedback to the questionnaire. 97.5% utilised WhatsApp for TO consultation. 15.2% patients were detected of Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with TO guidance. Up to 75% patients had a positive response to the questionnaire and 91.1% opined of savings achieved either with travel time, cost incurred or the treatment time. With respect to patient health status, 71.5% recovered, 20.1% had no change and 8.4% deteriorated with a mortality rate of 1.65%. Telehealth in otolaryngology during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown was indispensable in managing exigencies. Redesigning of clinical protocol and technical constraints, clinician training and a validated patient feedback questionnaire would effectively bestow upon the global emergencies.","Rathod, Ramya; Arora, Kanika; Chettuvati, Karthika; Abraham, Sajith; Angrish, Prerna; Sharma, Vikas; Agarwal, Ganesh; Muraleedharan, Manjul; Raj, Reshma; Panda, Naresh K.; Bakshi, Jaimanti; Mohindra, Satyawati; Gupta, Rijuneeta; Verma, Roshan; Bansal, Sandeep; Ramavat, Anurag; Nayak, Gyanaranjan; Patro, Sourabha K.; Kumar, Ashok; Virk, Ramandeep S.",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12070-021-02666-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34104634/,672

679064,Workshops for developing written exam questions go online: appropriate format according to the participants,2021-01-28,"The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) in China caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has led to worldwide human infections and deaths. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of coronaviruses (CoVs) is a multifunctional RNA binding protein necessary for viral RNA replication and transcription. Therefore, it is a potential antiviral drug target, serving multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle. This study addresses the potential to repurpose antiviral compounds approved or in development for treating human CoV induced infections against SARS‐CoV‐2 N. For this purpose, we used the docking methodology to better understand the inhibitory mechanism of this protein with the existing 34 antiviral compounds. The results of this analysis indicate that rapamycin, saracatinib, camostat, trametinib, and nafamostat were the top hit compounds with binding energy (−11.87, −10.40, −9.85, −9.45, −9.35 kcal/mol, respectively). This analysis also showed that the most common residues that interact with the compounds are Phe66, Arg68, Gly69, Tyr123, Ile131, Trp132, Val133, and Ala134. Subsequently, protein‐ligand complex stability was examined with molecular dynamics simulations for these five compounds, which showed the best binding affinity. According to the results of this study, the interaction between these compounds and crucial residues of the target protein were maintained. These results suggest that these residues are potential drug targeting sites for the SARS‐CoV‐2 N protein. This study information will contribute to the development of novel compounds for further in vitro and in vivo studies of SARS‐CoV‐2, as well as possible new drug repurposing strategies to treat COVID‐19 disease.","Tatar, Gizem; Ozyurt, Ezgi; Turhan, Kemal",Biotechnol Prog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33314794/; https://doi.org/10.1002/btpr.3110,672
679232,User Experiences of the NZ COVID Tracer App in New Zealand: Thematic Analysis of Interviews,2021-09-08,"BACKGROUND: To bridge the physical distance between parents and children during a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay, webcams are used in few German NICUs. They allow parents to view their infant even when they cannot be present on the ward. The aim of the study was to explore the factors for and against webcam use that parents with or without webcam use encountered. METHODS: Guideline-based, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted in the period from September 2019 to August 2020. Interview transcripts were analysed using a category-based content analysis. The categories were generated in a combined deductive–inductive procedure. RESULTS: We interviewed 33 mothers and seven fathers. Parents with webcam experience emphasised positive aspects concerning their webcam use. Factors that increased webcam acceptance included feeling certain about the child’s well-being and an increased sense of proximity. Only a few critical voices emerged from parents who had webcam experience, e.g. regarding privacy concerns. Parents who had no experience with webcam use showed ambivalence. On the one hand, they expressed a positive attitude towards the webcam system and acknowledged that webcam use could result in feelings of control. On the other hand, reservations emerged concerning an increase of mental stress or a negative influence on parental visitation behaviour. CONCLUSION: In addition to the parents’ positive experiences with webcam use, results show a need within parents who lacked webcam experience. Despite some criticism, it was evident that webcam use was primarily seen as an opportunity to counteract the negative consequences of separation in the postnatal phase.

686149,The role of additive manufacturing and antimicrobial polymers in the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-04-30,"OBJECTIVES: States vary significantly in their regulation of abortion. Misinformation about abortion is pervasive and propagated by state-mandated scripts that contain abortion myths. We sought to investigate women’s knowledge of abortion laws in their state. Our secondary objective was to describe women’s ability to discern myths about abortion from facts about abortion. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study of English- and Spanish-speaking women aged 18-49 in the United States. We enrolled members of the GfK KnowledgePanel, a probability-based, nationally-representative online sample. Our primary outcome was the proportion of correct answers to 12 questions about laws regulating abortion in a respondent’s state. We asked five questions about common abortion myths. We used descriptive statistics to characterize performance on these measures and bivariate and multivariate modeling to identify risk factors for poor knowledge of state abortion laws. RESULTS: Of 2223 women contacted, 1057 (48%) completed the survey. The mean proportion of correct answers to 12 law questions was 18% (95% CI 17-20%). For three of five assessed myths, women endorsed myths about abortion over facts. Those who believe abortion should be illegal (aOR 2.18, CI 1.40-3.37), and those living in states with neutral or hostile state policies toward abortion (neutral aOR 1.99, CI 1.34-2.97; hostile aOR 1.6, CI 1.07-2.36) were at increased odds of poor law knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Women had low levels of knowledge about state abortion laws and commonly endorse abortion myths. Women’s knowledge of their state’s abortion laws was associated with personal views about abortion and their state policy environment. IMPLICATIONS: Supporters of reproductive rights can use these results to show policy makers that their constituents are unlikely to know about laws being passed that may profoundly affect them. These findings underscore the potential benefit in correcting widely-held, medically-inaccurate beliefs about abortion so opinions about laws can be based on fact.","Swartz, Jonas J.; Rowe, Carly; Morse, Jessica E.; Bryant, Amy G.; Stuart, Gretchen S.",Contraception,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32771370/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2020.08.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010782420302985; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782420302985?v=s5,672
