8260,What Has SARS Taught Us About Infection Control in Nursing Homes?,2005-02-23,"Pharyngitis is the third most common illness diagnosed by pediatricians in the United States. Group A ß-hemolytic streptococci account for only approximately 30% of episodes of symptomatic pharyngitis. A broad list of other pathogens, including both bacteria and viruses, as well as Toxoplasma gondii and Candida species, are suggested frequently as the pathogens responsible for the remaining 70% of cases. This article reviews the evidence for a causative role of ß-hemolytic streptococci other than Streptococcus pyogenes and other bacteria and viruses in outbreaks and sporadic cases of pharyngitis. Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of pharyngitis caused by pathogens other than S pyogenes are offered.","Green, Michael",Semin Pediatr Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128870/,557
9972,Nurturing the forest of oral and maxillofacial surgery training: Author:,2020-04-18,"Background and aims The role of non‐cytomegalovirus (CMV) enteric viral infection in causing diarrhoea in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is poorly understood. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of these infections in acute and chronic diarrhoea. Methods Stool specimens from 377 HIV‐infected patients presenting with diarrhoea were studied prospectively for evidence of non‐CMV enteric viral infection. Patients with diarrhoea underwent investigation for gastrointestinal pathogens, including electron microscopic examination of stool for enteric viruses. We collected data on patients in whom enteric virus was identified and examined the association of enteric virus infection with diarrhoeal symptomatology. Results Eighty‐nine (10.3%) stool specimens from 60 (15.9%) HIV(+) individuals were positive for coronavirus (n = 13, 22%), rotavirus (n = 11, 18%), adenovirus (n = 30, 50%) and small round structured viruses (n = 5, 8%) or dual infection (n = 2, 3%). Thirty‐four of 52 (65%) patients available for analysis had acute diarrhoea, and 18/52 (35%) had chronic diarrhoea. Twenty‐three of 52 (44%) patients had a concurrent gut pathogen. After exclusion of concurrent pathogens enteric viral infections were found to be significantly associated with acute as opposed to chronic diarrhoea (P = 0.004). The presence of adenovirus colitis was significantly more likely to be associated with chronic diarrhoea (15/21 cases) than adenovirus isolated from stool alone (9/23 cases) (P = 0.03). There was a trend towards an association between adenovirus colitis and colonic cytomegalovirus infection (P = 0.06). Conclusion Enteric viral infection is strongly associated with acute diarrhoea in patients with HIV. Light microscopic examination of large bowel biopsies can identify adenovirus colitis which is significantly associated with chronic diarrhoea, and in addition may facilitate gastrointestinal co‐infection with CMV.","Thomas, PD.; Pollok, RcG.; Gazzard, BG.",HIV Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165535/,557
12851,The Equatoguinean Malaria Vaccine Initiative: From the Launching of a Clinical Research Platform to Malaria Elimination Planning in Central West Africa,2020-05-26,"Rheumatoid arthritis patients can be prescribed a combination of immunosuppressive drug leflunomide (LEF) and the antiviral drug acyclovir to reduce the high risk of infection. Acyclovir is a substrate of organic anion transporter (OAT) 1/3 and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 2. Considering the extraordinarily long half-life of LEF’s active metabolite teriflunomide (TER) and the kidney injury risk of acyclovir, it is necessary to elucidate the potential impact of LEF on the disposition of acyclovir. Here we used a specific MRP inhibitor MK571 and probenecid (OAT1/3 and MRP2 inhibitor) to assess the effects of MRP2 and OAT1/3 on the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of acyclovir in rats. We showed that LEF and probenecid, but not MK571 significantly increased the plasma concentration of acyclovir. However, kidney and liver exposures of acyclovir were increased when coadministered with LEF, probenecid or MK571. The kidney/plasma ratio of acyclovir was increased to approximately 2-fold by LEF or probenecid, whereas it was increased to as much as 14.5-fold by MK571. Consistently, these drugs markedly decreased the urinary excretion of acyclovir. TER (0.5−100 μmol/L) dose-dependently increased the accumulation of acyclovir in MRP2-MDCK cells with an IC(50) value of 4.91 μmol/L. TER (5 μmol/L) significantly inhibited the uptake of acyclovir in hOAT1/3-HEK293 cells. These results suggest that LEF/TER increased the kidney accumulation of acyclovir by inhibiting the efflux transporter MRP2, which increased its kidney/plasma ratio and renal injury risk. However, the inhibitory effects of LEF/TER on OAT1/3 reduced the tubular cells’ uptake of acyclovir and increased the plasma concentration.","Liao, Xiao-ying; Deng, Qiang-qiang; Han, Li; Wu, Zhi-tao; Peng, Zhao-liang; Xie, Yuan; Wang, Guang-ji; Aa, Ji-ye; Pan, Guo-yu",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470779/,557
13168,Self-management and HeAlth Promotion in Early-stage dementia with e-learning for carers (SHAPE): study protocol for a multi-centre randomised controlled trial,2020-10-09,"Epidemiological studies demonstrate that there are sex differences in the incidence, prevalence, and outcomes of cerebrovascular disease (CVD). The present study compared the structure and composition of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), neurovascular coupling, and cerebrovascular function and cognition in young Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Wall thickness and the inner diameter of the MCA were smaller in females than males. Female MCA exhibited less vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), diminished contractile capability, and more collagen in the media, and a thicker internal elastic lamina with fewer fenestrae compared with males. Female MCA had elevated myogenic tone, lower distensibility, and higher wall stress. The stress/strain curves shifted to the left in female vessels compared with males. The MCA of females failed to constrict compared with a decrease of 15.5 ± 1.9% in males when perfusion pressure was increased from 40 to 180 mmHg. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) rose by 57.4 ± 4.4 and 30.1 ± 3.1% in females and males, respectively, when perfusion pressure increased from 100 to 180 mmHg. The removal of endothelia did not alter the myogenic response in both sexes. Functional hyperemia responses to whisker-barrel stimulation and cognition examined with an eight-arm water maze were similar in both sexes. These results demonstrate that there are intrinsic structural differences in the MCA between sexes, which are associated with diminished myogenic response and CBF autoregulation in females. The structural differences do not alter neurovascular coupling and cognition at a young age; however, they might play a role in the development of CVD after menopause. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Using perfusion fixation of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in calcium-free solution at physiological pressure and systematically randomly sampling the sections prepared from the same M2 segments of MCA, we found that there are structural differences that are associated with altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation but not neurovascular coupling and cognition in young, healthy Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Understanding the intrinsic differences in cerebrovascular structure and function in males and females is essential to develop new pharmaceutical treatments for cerebrovascular disease (CVD).","Wang, Shaoxun; Zhang, Huawei; Liu, Yedan; Li, Longyang; Guo, Ya; Jiao, Feng; Fang, Xing; Jefferson, Joshua R.; Li, Man; Gao, Wenjun; Gonzalez-Fernandez, Ezekiel; Maranon, Rodrigo O.; Pabbidi, Mallikarjuna R.; Liu, Ruen; Alexander, Barbara T.; Roman, Richard J.; Fan, Fan",Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7346534/,557
16048,Smoking Cessation Using Wearable Sensors: Protocol for a Microrandomized Trial,2021-02-24,"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation and protective mechanical ventilation of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients induce hypercapnic respiratory acidosis. MAIN TEXT: Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO(2)R) aims to eliminate blood CO(2) to fight against the adverse effects of hypercapnia and related acidosis. Hypercapnia has deleterious extrapulmonary consequences, particularly for the brain. In addition, in the lung, hypercapnia leads to: lower pH, pulmonary vasoconstriction, increases in right ventricular afterload, acute cor pulmonale. Moreover, hypercapnic acidosis may further damage the lungs by increasing both nitric oxide production and inflammation and altering alveolar epithelial cells. During an exacerbation of COPD, relieving the native lungs of at least a portion of the CO(2) could potentially reduce the patient's respiratory work, Instead of mechanically increasing alveolar ventilation with MV in an already hyperinflated lung to increase CO(2) removal, the use of ECCO(2)R may allow a decrease in respiratory volume and respiratory rate, resulting in improvement of lung mechanic. Thus, the use of ECCO(2)R may prevent noninvasive ventilation failure and allow intubated patients to be weaned off mechanical ventilation. In ARDS patients, ECCO(2)R may be used to promote an ultraprotective ventilation in allowing to lower tidal volume, plateau (Pplat) and driving pressures, parameters that have identified as a major risk factors for mortality. However, although ECCO(2)R appears to be effective in improving gas exchange and possibly in reducing the rate of endotracheal intubation and allowing more protective ventilation, its use may have pulmonary and hemodynamic consequences and may be associated with complications. CONCLUSION: In selected patients, ECCO(2)R may be a promising adjunctive therapeutic strategy for the management of patients with severe COPD exacerbation and for the establishment of protective or ultraprotective ventilation in patients with ARDS without prognosis-threatening hypoxemia.","Giraud, Raphaël; Banfi, Carlo; Assouline, Benjamin; De Charrière, Amandine; Cecconi, Maurizio; Bendjelid, Karim",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7951130/,557
16675,The impact of thyroid tumor features on lymph node metastasis in papillary thyroid carcinoma patients in head and neck department at KAMC: A retrospective cross-sectional study,2021-03-22,"BACKGROUND: Complement activation is a central mechanism in systemic inflammation and remote organ dysfunction following major trauma. Data on temporal changes of complement activation early after injury is largely missing. We aimed to describe in detail the kinetics of complement activation in individual trauma patients from admission to 10 days after injury, and the association with trauma characteristics and outcome. METHODS: In a prospective cohort of 136 trauma patients, plasma samples obtained with high time resolution (admission, 2, 4, 6, 8 h, and thereafter daily) were assessed for terminal complement complex (TCC). We studied individual TCC concentration curves and calculated a summary measure to obtain the accumulated TCC response 3 to 6 h after injury (TCC-AUC(3–6)). Correlation analyses and multivariable linear regression analyses were used to explore associations between individual patients’ admission TCC, TCC-AUC(3–6), daily TCC during the intensive care unit stay, trauma characteristics, and predefined outcome measures. RESULTS: TCC concentration curves showed great variability in temporal shapes between individuals. However, the highest values were generally seen within the first 6 h after injury, before they subsided and remained elevated throughout the intensive care unit stay. Both admission TCC and TCC-AUC(3–6) correlated positively with New Injury Severity Score (Spearman’s rho, p-value 0.31, 0.0003 and 0.21, 0.02) and negatively with admission Base Excess (− 0.21, 0.02 and − 0.30, 0.001). Multivariable analyses confirmed that deranged physiology was an important predictor of complement activation. For patients without major head injury, admission TCC and TCC-AUC(3–6) were negatively associated with ventilator-free days. TCC-AUC(3–6) outperformed admission TCC as a predictor of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at day 0 and 4. CONCLUSIONS: Complement activation 3 to 6 h after injury was a better predictor of prolonged mechanical ventilation and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome than admission TCC. Our data suggest that the greatest surge of complement activation is found within the first 6 h after injury, and we argue that this time period should be in focus in the design of future experimental studies and clinical trials using complement inhibitors.

16838,Telehealth Diabetes Prevention Intervention for the Next Generation of African American Youth: Protocol for a Pilot Trial,2021-03-31,"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) suppresses inflammation and autoimmune diseases in preclinical and clinical studies. The underlying molecular, neurological, and anatomical mechanisms have been well characterized using acute electrophysiological stimulation of the vagus. However, there are several unanswered mechanistic questions about the effects of chronic VNS, which require solving numerous technical challenges for a long-term interface with the vagus in mice. Here, we describe a scalable model for long-term VNS in mice developed and validated in four research laboratories. We observed significant heart rate responses for at least 4 weeks in 60–90% of animals. Device implantation did not impair vagus-mediated reflexes. VNS using this implant significantly suppressed TNF levels in endotoxemia. Histological examination of implanted nerves revealed fibrotic encapsulation without axonal pathology. This model may be useful to study the physiology of the vagus and provides a tool to systematically investigate long-term VNS as therapy for chronic diseases modeled in mice.","Mughrabi, Ibrahim T; Hickman, Jordan; Jayaprakash, Naveen; Thompson, Dane; Ahmed, Umair; Papadoyannis, Eleni S; Chang, Yao-Chuan; Abbas, Adam; Datta-Chaudhuri, Timir; Chang, Eric H; Zanos, Theodoros P; Lee, Sunhee C; Froemke, Robert C; Tracey, Kevin J; Welle, Cristin; Al-Abed, Yousef; Zanos, Stavros",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8051950/,557

59526,"A Multisite 2-Year Follow Up of Psychopathology Prevalence, Predictors, and Correlates Among Adolescents Who Did or Did Not Undergo Weight Loss Surgery.",2018,"KEY POINTS Pairing stimulation of a finger flexor or extensor muscle at the motor point with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex generated plastic changes in motor output. Increases in output were greater in intrinsic hand muscles than in the finger flexor. No changes occurred in the finger extensor. This gradient was seen irrespective of which muscle was stimulated paired with transcranial magnetic stimulation. Intermittent theta-burst stimulation also produced increases in output, although these were similar across muscles. We suggest that intrinsic hand and flexor muscles have a higher potential to show plasticity than extensors, although only when plasticity is induced by sensory input. This may relate to differences seen in recovery of function in these muscles after injury, such as post-stroke. ABSTRACT The ability of the motor system to show plastic change underlies skill learning and also permits recovery after injury. One puzzling observation is that, after stroke, upper limb flexor muscles show good recovery but extensors remain weak, with this being a major contributor to residual disability. We hypothesized that there might be differences in potential for plasticity across hand and forearm muscles. In the present study, we investigated this using two protocols based on transcranial magnetic brain stimulation (TMS) in healthy human subjects. Baseline TMS responses were recorded from two intrinsic hand muscles: flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and extensor digitorum communis (EDC). In the first study, paired associative stimulation (PAS) was delivered by pairing motor point stimulation of FDS or EDC with TMS. Responses were then remeasured. Increases were greatest in the hand muscles, smaller in FDS and non-significant in EDC, irrespective of whether stimulation of FDS or EDC was used. In the second study, intermittent theta-burst rapid rate TMS was applied instead of PAS. In this case, all muscles showed similar increases in TMS responses. We conclude that the potential to show plastic changes in motor cortical output has the gradient: hand muscles > flexors > extensors. However, this was only seen in a protocol that requires integration of sensory input (PAS) and not when plasticity was induced purely by cortical stimulation (rapid rate TMS). This observation may relate to why functional recovery tends to favour flexor and hand muscles over extensors.","Foysal, K M Riashad; Baker, Stuart N",The Journal of physiology,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp277462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839110/,557

64118,"Timing, delays and pathways to diagnosis of endometriosis: a scoping review protocol.",2021-06-24,"OBJECTIVES Our aim was to determine if there was a correlation between the preoperative prolapse stage and postoperative recurrence of prolapse 1 year after sacrocolpopexy. Our null hypothesis is that the preoperative stage of prolapse does not increase the risk of recurrence. METHODS This is a multicenter cohort study from 3 centers. We included subjects who underwent robotic-assisted sacrocolpopexy and completed a standardized 1-year follow-up from 2009-2014. All subjects underwent a complete preoperative evaluation and completed 12 months of follow-up with the pelvic organ prolapse quantification examination. We compared those subjects who met the definition of recurrence with those who did not, analyzing the following covariates: stage of prolapse using International Continence Society (ICS) definitions, individual pelvic organ prolapse quantification points, age, body mass index, race, exogenous estrogen use, menopause, smoking, vaginal parity, cesarean section, and performance of concomitant procedures. We defined recurrence as any prolapse beyond the hymen. RESULTS We had 125 women from 3 centers who met our criteria, with 23.2% of them having recurrence at 1 year. We found that recurrence increased as the preoperative ICS stage of prolapse increased (P = <0.001 in the univariate model). In the multivariate model, using logistic regression, we found that the risk of recurrence of pelvic organ prolapse increased as the presurgery clinical stage increased with an odds ratio of 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.5-9) when controlling for age, menopausal status, and genital hiatus (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS Much like a higher stage of disease in oncology, we found that increasing stage of prolapse preoperatively increased the risk of recurrence at 1 year after sacrocolpopexy.","Aslam, Muhammad F; Osmundsen, Blake; Edwards, Sharon R; Matthews, Catherine; Gregory, William T",Female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/spv.0000000000000233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26571435/,557

71981,Preparing emergency and disaster medicine physicians to lead future responses: Crisis leadership a core competency.,2021-01-14,"INTRODUCTION In the Solitaire With the Intention For Thrombectomy (SWIFT) trial, rescue therapy was used when the Solitaire or Merci device was unable to restore vessel patency. Markers for nonrecanalization in acute stroke have been reported for intravenous tissue plasminogen activator; however, similar predictors are not known for endovascular therapy. We sought to identify predictors and outcomes associated with rescue therapy in the SWIFT trial. METHODS Rescue therapy included the use of an alternative device, agent, or maneuver following failure to recanalize with three retrieval attempts using the initial device. Clinical, angiographic, and demographic data was reviewed. RESULTS Among a total of 144 patients enrolled, 43 (29.9%) required rescue therapy. We used the same baseline demographics for patients with and without rescue therapy. Rescue therapy was used in a higher percentage of patients randomized to the Merci group compared with the Solitaire group (43 vs. 21%, p = 0.009). Patients with rescue therapy experienced a longer recanalization time (p < 0.001), a lower percentage of successful recanalization (p < 0.001), and a lower percentage of good outcome (p = 0.009). In multivariate analysis, patients randomized to the Merci group (OR 3.99, 95% CI 1.58, 10.10) and age >80 years (OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.06, 11.64) were predictors of rescue therapy. CONCLUSIONS Merci treatment group and age were predictors of rescue therapy, while a trend toward an increased need of rescue therapy was observed with hypertension and proximal clot location. Rescue therapy was associated with fewer good outcomes. These findings may reflect targets for improvement in endovascular therapy.","Lazzaro, Marc A; Zaidat, Osama O; Saver, Jeffrey L",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000362742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25337086/,557
73942,Palliative medicine video consultations in the pandemic: patient feedback.,2021-04-13,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has major issues for treating bacterial pneumonia. Currently, anoplin (GLLKRIKTLL-NH2) is a natural antimicrobial candidate derived from wasp venom. In this study, a series of new antimicrobial peptide (AMP) anoplin analogues were designed and synthesized. The relationship between their biological activities and their positive charge, hydrophobicity, amphipathicity, and secondary structure are described. The characteristic shared by these peptides is that positively charged amino acids and hydrophobic amino acids are severally arranged on the hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface of the α-helix to form a completely amphiphilic structure. To achieve ideal AMPs, below the range of the threshold of the cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity, their charges and hydrophobicity were increased as much. Among the new analogues, A-21 (KWWKKWKKWW-NH2) exhibited the greatest antimicrobial activity (geometric mean of minimum inhibitory concentrations = 4.76 μM) against all the tested bacterial strains, high bacterial cell selectivity in vitro, high effectiveness against bacterial pneumonia in mice infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae, and low toxicity in mice (LD50 = 82.01 mg/kg). A-21 exhibited a potent bacterial membrane-damaging mechanism and lipopolysaccharide-binding ability. These data provide evidence that A-21 is a promising antimicrobial candidate for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia.","Gou, Sanhu; Li, Beibei; Ouyang, Xu; Ba, Zufang; Zhong, Chao; Zhang, Tianyue; Chang, LinLin; Zhu, Yuewen; Zhang, Jingying; Zhu, Ningyi; Zhang, Yun; Liu, Hui; Ni, Jingman",Journal of medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00614; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180670/,557
73985,'Do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation' (DNACPR)-difficulty in discussions with older medical inpatients and their families: a survey of hospital doctors.,2021-07-14,"PURPOSE To evaluate the accuracy of the robot-assisted computed tomography (CT)-guided coordinate positioning puncture method by phantom and animal experiments. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the phantom experiment, seven robot-assisted punctures were made to evaluate the accuracy of the method. In the animal experiment, 18 punctures (nine robotic and nine manual) were made in the livers of nine rabbits. The indicators, such as needle-tract length, angle deviation, puncture accuracy, number of scans required, and radiation exposure dose were compared between manual and robotic punctures. The paired-samples t-test was used for analysis. RESULTS In the phantom experiment, the mean accuracy of seven punctures was 2.67 mm. In the animal experiment, there was no significant difference in needle-tract length (32.58 mm vs. 34.04 mm, p = .606), angle deviation (17.21° vs. 21.23° p = .557) and puncture accuracy (8.42 vs. 8.77 mm, p = .851) between the two groups. However, the number CT scans required (2.44 vs. 3.33, p = .002), and the radiation exposure dose (772.98 vs. 1077.89 mGy/cm, p = .003) were lower in the robot group than in the manual group.

78229,Patterns of dengue in Nepal from 2010-2019 in relation to elevation and climate.,2020-11-16,"Background A longer left superior pulmonary vein (LSPV) stump may increase the risk for postoperative cerebral infarction. Although the residual stump is generally longer after left upper lobectomy (LUL) than for other lobectomies, the length of the LSPV stump after LUL may be influenced by the anatomical relationship between the left atrial appendage (LAA) and the LSPV. Our aim in this study was to investigate the influence of this anatomical relationship on the residual length of the LSPV stump after LUL. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of 85 patients who underwent LUL at our institution, between January 2014 and March 2018. Based on pre-operative computed tomography (CT) images, the anatomical relationship between the LSPV and the LAA was classified into two patterns, namely an antero-superior and a postero-inferior pattern. The length of the LSPV stump for these two patterns was evaluated on postoperative CT images and compared between the two groups. Results Of the 85 patients, 49 were classified in the antero-superior pattern and 36 in the postero-inferior pattern. The mean length of the LSPV stump after LUL, overall, was 21.9 (range, 15-38) mm, with the stump being significantly longer for the antero-posterior (24.2 mm) than postero-inferior (18.9 mm) pattern. Conclusions The anatomical relationship between the LSPV and LAA, identified on pre-operative CT images, was associated with the length of the LSPV stump after LUL.","Minegishi, Kentaro; Tsubochi, Hiroyoshi; Maki, Mitsuru; Endo, Shunsuke",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-20-1170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32944321/,557

Older adults are at higher risk of severe illness from the disease and face an increasingly ageist general population who misrepresent the pandemic as an older adult problem. We use the Theory of Planned Behavior framework to examine vaccine behavior intention. METHOD A convenience sample (n = 583) of adults aged 60 and older in the United States participated in an online survey using vignettes. Hierarchical regression and analysis of covariance were used to test our model. RESULTS Results suggest that perceived risk of the pandemic, general vaccine beliefs, and political affiliation influence respondents' attitude toward the vaccine. Respondents' attitudes toward the vaccine and their physician's recommendation help shape vaccine intention. CONCLUSION The results provide partial support to the proposed model in shaping vaccine intention among older adults.","Callow, Michael A; Callow, Daniel D",Journal of applied gerontology : the official journal of the Southern Gerontological Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/07334648211019205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34036821/,557

Aim Our primary objective is to determine the efficacy of various laparoscopic defogging techniques (LDT) through a randomized controlled trial that employs a novel simulation model of the abdominopelvic cavity. Settings and Design This study was conducted at academic community hospital. This study design was a randomized controlled trial through simulation. Subjects and Methods A chamber was constructed that simulated the abdominopelvic cavity. We used 5 and 10 mm 0° laparoscopes. A 10 cm visual analog scale was developed to assign visual clarity (VC) scores. The 10 cm mark indicated perfect VC. We employed the following LDTs: (1) glove warming (GLOVE), (2) surfactant solution (Fog Reduction and Elimination Device [FRED]), (3) chlorhexidine solution (SOAP), (4) warm saline (SALINE), and (5) control. Three observers were blinded to the LDT used. Primary outcomes included VC scores at designated time intervals (5, 30, and 60 s) for each LDT. A minimum of 10 observations per time interval were required to achieve adequate power based on a 2.5 cm difference in VC scores. Results For the 10 mm laparoscope, FRED, SOAP, and SALINE had a VC score at 60 s (VC60) higher than control (4.8 ± 2.2, 7.8 ± 0.8, 7.9 ± 0.7 vs. 2.4 ± 0.72, P < 0.05). Both SOAP and SALINE VC60 scores were higher than FRED (7.8 ± 0.8, 7.9 ± 0.7 vs. 4.8 ± 2.2, P < 0.05). No differences were noted in VC60 scores between control and GLOVE (2.4 ± 0.72 vs. 3.1 ± 2.2, P > 0.05) and between SOAP and SALINE (7.8 ± 0.8 vs. 7.9 ± 0.7, P > 0.05). Similar results were noted with the 5 mm laparoscope. Conclusions Common LDTs such as SALINE and SOAP were more effective than FRED, while GLOVE was no different than control. These results demonstrate that the use of effective LDTs can potentially translate into improved patient care and operative outcomes during surgery.","Palvia, Vijay; Gonzalez, Aaron J Herrera; Vigh, Richard S; Anasti, James N",Gynecology and minimally invasive therapy,https://doi.org/10.4103/gmit.gmit_39_18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30306034/,557

The COVID-19 pandemic poses a different question for existing rehabilitation services: how best to respond to a disaster that is anticipated from afar, but whose shape has yet to take full form? METHODS Applying the 5-phase crisis management model of Pearson and Mitroff, we report our experience at one of Scotland's largest centres for rehabilitation, in planning to cope with COVID-19. RESULTS Contingency rehabilitation planning can be framed in a 5-phase crisis management model that includes (i) signal detection; (ii) prevention/preparedness; (iii) damage limitation; (iv) recovery; and (v) learning. We have reported the impact of COVID-19 on rehabilitation services within a Scottish context and shared some of our learning. CONCLUSION COVID-19 has challenged healthcare worldwide and has served as an amplifier for the recognised ill effects of poverty and inequality. As rehabilitation clinicians, we are in a position to continue advocating for people facing disability, and also seeking and responding to signals of COVID-19's late effects in both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients alike.

84766,Palliative medicine integration in the USA: cancer centre executives' attitudes.,2021-04-12,"Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT) and involves a complex web of pathogenic mechanisms. Mutant HTT (mHTT) disrupts transcription, interferes with immune and mitochondrial function, and is aberrantly modified post-translationally. Evidence suggests that the mHTT RNA is toxic, and at the DNA level, somatic CAG repeat expansion in vulnerable cells influences the disease course. Genome-wide association studies have identified DNA repair pathways as modifiers of somatic instability and disease course in HD and other repeat expansion diseases. In animal models of HD, nucleocytoplasmic transport is disrupted and its restoration is neuroprotective. Novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers are among the earliest detectable changes in individuals with premanifest HD and have the sensitivity to detect therapeutic benefit. Therapeutically, the first human trial of an HTT-lowering antisense oligonucleotide successfully, and safely, reduced the CSF concentration of mHTT in individuals with HD. A larger trial, powered to detect clinical efficacy, is underway, along with trials of other HTT-lowering approaches. In this Review, we discuss new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of HD and future therapeutic strategies, including the modulation of DNA repair and targeting the DNA mutation itself.","Tabrizi, Sarah J; Flower, Michael D; Ross, Christopher A; Wild, Edward J",Nature reviews.

The writing group included researchers experienced in meta-analyses and observational studies of etiology. Standard peer-review was performed. While the structure of systematic reviews of observational studies on etiology may be similar to that for systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials, there are specific tasks within each component that differ. Examples include assessment for confounding, selection bias, and information bias. In systematic reviews of observational studies of etiology, combining studies in meta-analysis may lead to more precise estimates, but such greater precision does not automatically remedy potential bias. Thorough exploration of sources of heterogeneity is key when assessing the validity of estimates and causality. CONCLUSION As many reviews of observational studies on etiology are being performed, this document may provide researchers with guidance on how to conduct and analyse such reviews.","Dekkers, Olaf M; Vandenbroucke, Jan P; Cevallos, Myriam; Renehan, Andrew G; Altman, Douglas G; Egger, Matthias",PLoS medicine,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30789892/,557

METHODS 255 CT-guided lung biopsies performed for 249 lesions in 249 patients from August 2014 to August 2019 were retrospectively analysed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Risk prediction models were established using backward stepwise variable selection and likelihood ratio tests and were internally validated using split-sample methods. RESULTS The overall incidence of pneumothorax was 30.2% (77/255). ICC insertion was required for 8.32% (21/255) of all procedures. The significant independent risk factors for pneumothorax were lesions not in contact with pleura (P < 0.001), a shorter skin-to-pleura distance (P = 0.01), the needle crossing a fissure (P = 0.004) and emphysema (P = 0.01); those for ICC insertion for pneumothorax were a needle through emphysema (P < 0.001) and lesions in the upper lobe (P = 0.017). AUC of the predictive models for pneumothorax and ICC insertion were 0.800 (95% CI: 0.745-0.856) and 0.859 (95% CI: 0.779-0.939) respectively. Upon internal validation, AUC of the testing sets of pneumothorax and ICC insertion were 0.769 and 0.822 on average respectively. CONCLUSION The complication rates of pneumothorax and ICC insertion after CT-guided lung biopsy at our institution are comparable to results from previously reported studies. This study provides highly accurate risk prediction models of pneumothorax and ICC insertion for patients undergoing CT-guided lung biopsies.","Weon, JangHo; Robson, Scott; Chan, Ronald; Ussher, Simon",Journal of medical imaging and radiation oncology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1754-9485.13187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955169/,557
96062,Experience of Oculoplastic Practice in Times of COVID-19 Pandemic at a Tertiary Care Centre: Precautions and Challenges.,2020-10-01,"The mechanism of hypertrophic scar reduction using silicone gel sheeting remains elusive. We hypothesize that the decrease in scar formation is due to occlusion and homeostasis of the barrier layer. Using an established model of hypertrophic scarring, rabbits were divided into four groups and scars were tape-stripped or occluded with Kelocote, Cavilon, or Indermil, with each rabbit serving as its own internal control. All wounds were harvested on day 28 and examined histologically to measure the scar elevation index (SEI), epithelial thickness, and cellularity. Immunohistochemistry fluorescence was used to quantify inflammation in the dermis. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured for each occlusive agent and tape stripping. Ultrastructural analysis was performed by electron microscopy. Kelocote, Cavilon, and Indermil all significantly decreased SEI when compared with controls. Each of the occlusive treatments was shown to decrease TEWL while tape stripping increased TEWL. Tape stripping significantly increased the SEI, epithelial thickness, and cellularity. Immunostaining for macrophages showed increased density of inflammatory cells in the tape-stripped scars. Under electron microscopy, the tape-stripped wounds displayed extensive inflammation and keratinocyte damage. Both unwounded skin and occlusion-treated scars did not display these characteristics. In conclusion, hypertrophic scarring was reduced regardless of occlusive method used. Furthermore, repeated disruption of the permeability barrier by tape stripping led to an increase in scarring. Ultrastructural analysis suggests that occluded wounds may be in an advanced state of wound repair. Occlusion may mediate its effects through establishing homeostasis of the epidermal barrier layer.","O'Shaughnessy, Kristina D; De La Garza, Mauricio; Roy, Nakshatra K; Mustoe, Thomas A",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-475x.2009.00534.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19769722/,557
97228,What I learned from working as a waitress after PA school.,2021-06-01,"INTRODUCTION Community face mask use during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has considerably differed worldwide. Generally, Asians are more inclined to wear face masks during disease outbreaks. Hong Kong has emerged relatively unscathed during the initial outbreak of COVID-19, despite its dense population. Previous infectious disease outbreaks influenced the local masking behaviour and response to public health measures. Thus, local behavioural insights are important for the successful implementation of infection control measures. This study explored the behaviour and attitudes of wearing face masks in the community during the initial spread of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. METHODS We observed the masking behaviour of 10 211 pedestrians in several regions across Hong Kong from 1 to 29 February 2020. We supplemented the data with an online survey of 3199 respondents' views on face mask use. RESULTS Among pedestrians, the masking rate was 94.8%; 83.7% wore disposable surgical masks. However, 13.0% wore surgical masks incorrectly with 42.5% worn too low, exposing the nostrils or mouth; 35.5% worn 'inside-out' or 'upside-down'. Most online respondents believed in the efficacy of wearing face mask for protection (94.6%) and prevention of community spread (96.6%). Surprisingly, 78.9% reused their mask; more respondents obtained information from social media (65.9%) than from government websites (23.2%). CONCLUSIONS In Hong Kong, members of the population are motivated to wear masks and believe in the effectiveness of face masks against disease spread. However, a high mask reuse rate and errors in masking techniques were observed. Information on government websites should be enhanced and their accessibility should be improved.","Tam, V C W; Tam, S Y; Khaw, M L; Law, H K W; Chan, C P L; Lee, S W Y",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.12809/hkmj209015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33762440/,557
100433,Comparison of Static Retinal Vessel Caliber Measurements by Different Commercially Available Platforms.,2021-09-20,"BACKGROUND High-income countries continuously reform their healthcare systems. Often, similar reforms are introduced concomitantly across countries. Although national policymakers would benefit from considering reform experiences abroad, exchange is limited. This paper provides an overview of health reform trends in 31 high-income countries in 2018 and 2019, i.e., before Covid-19. METHODS Information was collected from national experts from the Health Systems and Policy Monitor network. Experts were asked to report on the three ""top"" national health reforms 2018 and 2019. In 2019, they provided an update of 2018 reforms. Reforms were assigned to one of 11 clusters and identified as one of seven different reform types. RESULTS 81 reforms were reported in 28 countries in 2018. 44/81 went to four clusters: 'insurance coverage & resource generation', 'governance', 'healthcare purchasing & payment', and 'organisation of hospital care'. In 2019, 86 reforms in 30 countries were reported. 48/86 fell under 'organisation of primary & ambulatory care', 'governance', 'care coordination & specialised care', and 'organisation of hospital care'. Most 2018 reforms were reported ongoing in 2019; 27 implemented; seven abandoned. Health agency-led reforms were implemented most frequently, followed by central government-legislated reforms. CONCLUSIONS Policymakers can leverage international experience of distinct reform approaches addressing similar challenges and similar approaches to address distinct problems. Such knowledge may help inspire or support future successful health reform processes.","Polin, Katherine; Hjortland, Maximilien; Maresso, Anna; van Ginneken, Ewout; Busse, Reinhard; Quentin, Wilm",Health policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2021.04.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34053787/,557

107314,Factors other than medical acuity that influence hospitalisation: a scoping review protocol.,2019,"PURPOSE Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) has been shown to affect the myocardium, resulting in a worse clinical outcome. In this registry study, we aimed to identify differences in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) between COVID-19 and all-cause myocarditis. MATERIALS AND METHODS We examined CMRI of patients with COVID-19 and elevated high-sensitivity serum troponin levels performed between March 31st and May 5th and compared them to CMRI of patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection with suspected myocarditis in the same time period. For this purpose, we evaluated Lake-Louise Criteria for myocarditis by determining nonischemic myocardial injury via T1-mapping, extracellular volume, late gadolinium enhancement, and myocardial edema (ME) by T2-mapping and fat-saturated T2w imaging (T2Q). RESULTS A total of 15 of 18 (89%) patients with COVID-19 had abnormal findings. The control group consisted of 18 individuals. There were significantly fewer individuals with COVID-19 who had increased T2 (5 vs. 10; P=0.038) and all-cause ME (7 vs. 15; P=0.015); thus, significantly fewer patients with COVID-19 fulfilled Lake-Louise Criteria (6 vs. 17; P<0.001). In contrast, nonischemic myocardial injury was not significantly different. In the COVID-19 group, indexed end-diastolic volume of the left ventricle showed a significant correlation to the extent of abnormal T1 (R2=0.571; P=0.017) and extracellular volume (R2=0.605; P=0.013) and absolute T1, T2, and T2Q (R2=0.644; P=0.005, R2=0.513; P=0.035 and R2=0.629; P=0.038, respectively); in the control group, only extracellular volume showed a weak correlation (R2=0.490; P=0.046). CONCLUSIONS Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 seems to show less ME than all-cause myocarditis. Abnormal CMRI markers correlated to left ventricle dilation only in the COVID-19 group. Larger comparative studies are needed to verify our findings.","Maurus, Stephan; Weckbach, Ludwig T; Marschner, Constantin; Kunz, Wolfgang G; Ricke, Jens; Kazmierczak, Philip M; Bieber, Stephanie; Brado, Johannes; Kraechan, Angelina; Hellmuth, Johannes C; Hausleiter, Joerg; Massberg, Steffen; Grabmaier, Ulrich; Curta, Adrian",Journal of thoracic imaging,https://doi.org/10.1097/rti.0000000000000599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34108409/,557
108684,Living and dying with cystic fibrosis.,2020-09-11,"The study examined parental distress and apprehension about raising an infant during the COVID-19 pandemic among new Israeli parents, investigating the role of personal resources (low attachment avoidance and anxiety, high self-mastery) and various COVID-19-related anxieties and comparing mothers and fathers. A convenience sample of 606 Israeli parents (469 mothers and 137 fathers) whose first child was 3-12 months old was recruited through social media. No significant differences emerged between mothers and fathers in level of parental distress or apprehension. Poorer health, higher attachment avoidance and anxiety, lower self-mastery, and a higher level of COVID-19-related anxiety over going for infant health checkups contributed significantly to greater parental distress. Lower level of education, being a woman, higher attachment avoidance and anxiety, and higher levels of all COVID-19-related anxieties contributed significantly to greater pandemic-related apprehension. The findings show that new parents may experience parental distress and concerns about raising a child during the crisis, and that whereas specific COVID-19-anxieties are unrelated to global parental distress, they are linked to the apprehension aroused by the pandemic. Moreover, they highlight the contribution of parents' personal resources, showing that lower attachment avoidance and anxiety are associated with lower distress and apprehension, whereas self-mastery is especially significant for lessening the apprehension about raising an infant in this period. These insights may be used in targeted interventions to reduce distress in vulnerable populations, such as individuals who recently became parents for the first time.

For right thoracotomy, a conventional, cuffed, endotracheal tube (ETT) was inserted and guided into the left mainstem bronchus with a bronchoscope and the left lung was ventilated. For left thoracotomy, an AEB was inserted into the trachea 2 cm past the vocal cords and an ETT was placed through the cords adjacent to the blockers (extraluminal). A bronchoscope was then inserted through the ETT to visualize and manipulate the blocker into the left mainstem bronchus. The blocker cuff was inflated slowly under direct vision while the ETT continued to ventilate the right, dependent lung. ABG values were collected intraoperatively in all cases. RESULTS One-lung ventilation could be accomplished within 15 min in all cases, and lung isolation was successful in all patients. All patients were extubated within 12 h of surgery and had an uneventful recovery. ABG values revealed modest arterial acidosis and hypercarbia and mild acute ventilatory insufficiency. CONCLUSION The use of extraluminal AEB or mainstem intubation for OLV can be successfully completed in infants weighing less than 10 kg. OLV may induce acute respiratory pathology; therefore we recommend routine intraoperative ABG monitoring for pediatric patients.","Sutton, Christopher J; Naguib, Ayman; Puri, Suvikram; Sprenker, Collin J; Camporesi, Enrico M",Journal of anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-012-1413-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22592809/,557
111443,Emergency Preparedness and Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Our Experience from the Emergency Department of a Tertiary Care Hospital in Pakistan.,2020-06-01,"The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the availability of evidence for one of the earliest available minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) procedures, the Trabectome. Various databases were searched up to December 20, 2016, for any published studies assessing the use of the Trabectome as a solo procedure in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). The standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated for the change in intraocular pressure (IOP) and number of glaucoma mediations used at 1-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up. After screening, three studies and one abstract with analyzable data were included. The meta-analysis showed statistically significant reductions in IOP and number of glaucoma medications used at all time points. Though the Trabectome as a solo procedure appears to lower IOP and reduces the number of glaucoma medications, more high-quality studies are required to make definitive conclusions. The difficulty of obtaining evidence may be one of the many obstacles that limit a full understanding of the potential safety and/or efficacy benefits compared to standard treatments. The time has come for a thoughtful and integrated approach with stakeholders to determine optimal access to care strategies for our patients.","Chow, Jeffrey T Y; Hutnik, Cindy M L; Solo, Karla; Malvankar-Mehta, Monali S",Journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/2965725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28740733/,557

The success of a low community spread of the novel coronavirus-19 can be attributed to the government's rapid response in effective community participation through communication, promoting personal hygiene, social distancing, quarantine, and rapid mapping to trace, identify, and test potentially COVID-19 exposed persons. In addition to effective public awareness, legal and spiritual approaches were utilized to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the country of Belize. From March 2020 when the first case was confirmed, the methods employed to curb spread were so effective that no new case was reported for over 50 days. In an attempt to reopen the country for business, the success of effectively preventing widespread of the COVID-19 made the government ease some of the strict preventive measures of community spread. Presently, new COVID-19 cases are being reported as a result of illegal border crossing, repatriations of Belizeans abroad, and the apparent lack of adherence to the earlier measures put in place by the government to curb community spread of the COVID-19. The rise in the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths in Belize seem to jeopardize the success story of community spread earlier recorded in the country. This article presents some of the earlier measures put in place by the government of Belize that effectively curbed the community spread of COVID-19 in the country of Belize.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-two uncooperative patients, attending primary and secondary schools, were submitted to emergency dental treatments with inhalation conscious sedation using nitrous oxide and oxygen during COVID-19 pandemic. Collected data included: number of working sessions, success/failure, adverse events, side effects, number of teeth treated; type of dental procedure. Parents filled in an e-mailed questionnaire on post-discharge children status to evaluate: pain; crying; fever; vomiting; headache; drowsiness; excitability; irritability; ability to eat; need for drugs. RESULTS One working session was carried out in 29 patients, 2 working sessions were carried out in 6 patients and 3 working sessions were carried out in 7 patients. Success rate was 87.1%. In relation to success, there was no statistically significant difference between males and females, healthy and disabled patients, respectively; while there was a statistically significant difference between patients attending primary and secondary schools (p=0.023). No adverse events occurred. The most frequent side effect was nausea. In relation to side effects, there was no statistically significant difference between males and females, healthy and disabled patients, patients attending primary and secondary schools, respectively. In relation to e-mailed questionnaires on post-discharge children status, 29.6% of the patients had pain, 22.2% vomited, 14.8% had headache, 18.5% experienced drowsiness, 29.6% failed to eating normally, 35.2% needed to take drugs. None of the patients cried, had a fever, exhibited irritability and excitability. CONCLUSION Inhalation conscious sedation is a safe, practical and effective procedure with minimal side effects to perform emergency dental treatments in uncooperative paediatric patients during COVID-19 outbreak.","Ferrazzano, G G; Quaraniello, M; Sangianantoni, G; Ingenito, A; Cantile, T",European journal of paediatric dentistry,https://doi.org/10.23804/ejpd.2020.21.04.4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33337902/,557

The aim of this study is to compare laparoscopic vs. open outcomes and costs. METHODS The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) was used to compare durations of surgery, anesthesia time, and length of stay (LOS). The University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC) was used to review the cost and complications between approaches. Patients were matched on demographics, year of procedure and surgical approach between datasets for statistical analysis. RESULTS A sample of 5468 patients undergoing OIHR (N = 4,693) or LIHR (N = 775) was selected from UHC from 2008-2011. An identical number of patients from NSQIP were matched to those from UHC resulting in a total of 10,936 records. LIHR patients had shorter duration of wait from admission to operation (p < 0.05). Conversely, LIHR patients had longer operating time (p < 0.05), duration of anesthesia (p < 0.05), and time in the operating room (p < 0.05).Overall complication rate was higher in open (3.1 vs. 1.8 %, p < 0.05). Cost favored open over LIHR ($4360 vs $5105). The cost discrepancy mainly stemmed from LIHR supplies ($1448 vs. $340; p < 0.05) and OR services ($1380 vs. $1080; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION This study demonstrates the LOS and perioperative outcomes were superior in the LIHR group; however, the overall cost was higher due to the supplies. Advancement in technology, surgeons' skill level and preference of supplies are all factors in decreasing the overall cost of LIHR.","Tadaki, C; Lomelin, D; Simorov, A; Jones, R; Humphreys, M; daSilva, M; Choudhury, S; Shostrom, V; Boilesen, E; Kothari, V; Oleynikov, D; Goede, M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-016-1465-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26874507/,557
115723,"Spatiotemporal characteristics of asthma emergency department presentations in diverse geographical and climatic regions, Queensland, Australia.",2020-11-23,"BACKGROUND Law enforcement-related deaths of unarmed black Americans may lead black communities to distrust public institutions. Our study quantifies the impact of law enforcement-related deaths of black New York residents on the use of hospital emergency departments (ED) during 2013-2016. METHODS We used regression discontinuity models stratified by race and time period (2013-2015 and 2015-2016) to estimate the impact of law enforcement-related deaths on ED rates. Dates of deaths and media reports were from the Mapping Police Violence database. We calculated the daily overall and condition-specific ED visit rates from the New York's Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System. RESULTS There were 14 law enforcement-related deaths of unarmed black New York residents from 2013 to 2016. In 2013-2014, the ED rate among black New Yorkers decreased by 7.7 visits per 100 000 black New Yorkers (5% less than the average ED rate) using the date of media report as the cut-off with a 2-week exposure window. No changes in ED rates were noted for black New Yorkers in 2015-2016 or for white New Yorkers in either time period. Models using the date of death followed a similar pattern. CONCLUSION The decrease in ED rates among black New Yorkers immediately following media reports of law enforcement-related deaths involving unarmed black New Yorkers during 2013-2014 may represent potentially harmful delays in healthcare. Reforms implemented during 2015-2016 might have modified the impact of these deaths. Further investigation into the population health impacts of law enforcement-related deaths is needed.","Liu, Sze Yan; Lim, Sungwoo; Gould, L Hannah",Journal of epidemiology and community health,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-214089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33028616/,557

Methods: We conducted a match-controlled cohort trial and participants were assigned to either the training (intervention, INT, N = 16) or non-training (control, CON, N = 17) group. INT performed 30-s WAnT bouts three times a day in the morning, afternoon and evening with each bout separated by ~4 h of rest, performed for 3 days a week for 6 weeks. Criterion measures of peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), leg strength, insulin markers such as homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) and quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI), blood lipids profile and health-related quality of life (HRQL) survey were assessed before and after 6 weeks in both groups. Results: Absolute VO2peak increased by 8.3 ± 7.0% (p < 0.001) after INT vs. 0.9 ± 6.1% in CON (p = 0.41) group. Maximal voluntary contraction at 30°·s-1 of the dominant lower-limb flexors in INT increased significantly post-training (p = 0.03). There were no changes in the INT individuals' other cardiorespiratory markers, HOMA, QUICKI, blood lipids, and HRQL measures (all p > 0.05) between pre- and post-training; but importantly, no differences were observed between INT and CON groups (all p > 0.05). Conclusions: The results indicate that 6 weeks of dispersed sprint cycle training increased cardiorespiratory fitness and dynamic leg strength but had minimal impact on insulin sensitivity, blood lipids and quality of life in the exercising individuals.","Wun, Chun Hou; Zhang, Mandy Jiajia; Ho, Boon Hor; McGeough, Kenneth; Tan, Frankie; Aziz, Abdul Rashid",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134860; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32640602/,557

In the current study, we conducted a systematic review of the outcome literature on CBT-E, with both narrative and meta-analytic synthesis. We included single-group uncontrolled pre-post design studies and randomised control trials (RCTs) of CBT-E, which allowed us to include a larger number of studies, and also compare the two methodologies in terms of effect size. The primary analysis included 15 CBT-E studies with a total of 948 participants. Narrative synthesis examined bingeing and purging episodes, BMI change, and follow-up results. A large, statistically significant effect supported CBT-E as a treatment for all EDs (g = 1.06). When comparing methodologies, both pre-post design studies (g = 1.26) and RCTs (g = 0.82) yielded large effects. Narrative synthesis outlined reductions in ED behaviours and increases in BMI which were maintained at follow-up. Limitations include that further RCTs of CBT-E are needed to establish clinical effectiveness of this treatment approach for all EDs; however, results from narrative exploration indicate this endeavour would be worthwhile. Despite the limitations, this study provides additional support for CBT-E as a successful treatment across the range of EDs.","Dahlenburg, Sophie C; Gleaves, David H; Hutchinson, Amanda D",Eating disorders,https://doi.org/10.1080/10640266.2018.1560240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30632926/,557

We conducted an exploratory single-center analysis to estimate the change in number of new stroke diagnoses in our region, and evaluate the proximate reasons for this change during the COVID-19 pandemic at a tertiary care center in New Jersey. PATIENTS AND METHODS A Comprehensive Stroke Center prospective cohort was retrospectively analyzed for the number of stroke admissions, demographic features, and short-term outcomes 5 months prior to 3/1/2020 (pre-COVID-19), and in the 6 weeks that followed (COVID-19 period). The primary outcome was the number of new acute stroke diagnoses before and during the COVID-19 period, as well as the potential reasons for a decline in the number of new diagnoses. RESULTS Of the 328 included patients, 53 (16%) presented in the COVID-19 period. There was a mean fall of 38% in new stroke diagnoses (mean 1.13/day [SD 1.07] from 1.82/day [SD 1.38], p<0.01), which was related to a 59% decline in the number of daily transfers from referral centers (p<0.01), 25% fewer telestroke consultations (p=0.08), and 55% fewer patients presenting directly to our institution by private vehicle (p<0.01) and 29% fewer patients through emergency services (p=0.09). There was no significant change in the monthly number of strokes due to large vessel occlusion (LVO), however the proportion of new LVOs nearly doubled in the COVID-19 period (38% vs. 21%, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS The observations at our tertiary care center corroborate anecdotal reports that the number of new stroke diagnoses is falling, which seems related to a smaller proportion of patients seeking healthcare services for milder symptoms. These preliminary data warrant validation in larger, multi-center studies.","Siegler, J E; Heslin, M E; Thau, L; Smith, A; Jovin, T G",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.104953; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32689621/,557
121393,Avoidable deaths due to infodemic about COVID-19.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND Sevoflurane is one of the most frequently used inhaled anesthetics for general anesthesia. Previously it has been reported that at clinically used doses of sevoflurane, cerebral vasoreactivity is maintained. However, there are no data how sevoflurane influences systemic and cerebral circulation in parallel. The aim of our study was to assess systemic and cerebral hemodynamic changes as well as cerebral CO2-reactivity during sevoflurane anesthesia. METHODS Twenty nine patients undergoing general anesthesia were enrolled. Anesthesia was maintained with 1 MAC sevoflurane in 40% oxygen. Ventilatory settings (respiratory rate and tidal volume) were adjusted to reach and maintain 40, 35 and 30 mmHg EtCO2 for 5 min respectively. At the end of each period, transcranial Doppler and hemodynamic parameters using applanation tonometry were recorded. RESULTS Systemic mean arterial pressure significantly decreased during anesthetic induction and remained unchanged during the entire study period. Central aortic and peripherial pulse pressure and augmentation index as markers of arterial stiffness significantly increased during the anesthetic induction and remained stable at the time points when target CO2 levels were reached. Both cerebral autoregulation and cerebral CO2-reactivity was maintained at 1 MAC sevoflurane. DISCUSSION Cerebral autoregulation and CO2-reactivity is preserved at 1 MAC sevoflurane. Cerebrovascular effects of anesthetic compounds have to be assessed together with systemic circulatory effects.

We report our experience with right-sided, hand-assisted, laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (HALDN). PATIENTS AND METHODS During a 7-year period (2003-2010), right HALDN was performed on 51 and left HALDN on 40 living kidney donors. We prospectively collected perioperative outcome data in donors and recipients including graft function and calculated 1-year graft survival according to the Kaplan-Meier-method. RESULTS There were no conversions. The mean procedure time was 123 minutes versus 135 minutes for left HALDN (P = .09). Mean blood loss was 92 mL versus 101 mL in left HALDN (P = .09). There was no renal artery or vein thrombosis. The mean warm ischemia time was 47 seconds versus 41 seconds in left HALDN (P = .21). Hospital discharge was on an average at 3.4 days postoperatively. Delayed graft function occurred in two recipients: one in the left group and the other in the right group. Further, no significant difference in serum creatinine values was seen between the groups at 1 year after the transplantation. One-year graft survival rate was 97.5% in the left versus 98.1% in the right group. CONCLUSION Right HALDN is as safe and feasible as left HALDN.

Although these changes are necessary, they will differentially affect patients in a way that highlights and exacerbates existing inequities in health care access and outcomes. Socially vulnerable groups are already disproportionately affected by COVID-19 infection and more likely to experience severe morbidity and mortality. Some reasons for this include a limited ability to practice risk-reducing behaviors such as physical distancing, higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions, and less access to medical care. Additionally, the structural changes now taking place in health care delivery have negatively affected the ability of socially vulnerable groups to obtain necessary obstetric and gynecologic care, which may lead to poorer outcomes.

Recently, tissue sealing-cutting devices, which are easy to use and achieve simultaneous selective sealing and cutting with less production of heat, have been used. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a tissue sealing-cutting device vs monopolar electrocautery on wound healing in the early postoperative period after pilonidal sinus surgery. DESIGN This study was a prospective randomized clinical trial. SETTING This study was conducted at Military Hospital, Eskisehir, Turkey. PATIENTS In total, 128 patients with chronic pilonidal disease were randomly assigned into 2 clinically comparable groups between December 2009 and June 2010. INTERVENTION Pilonidal sinus excision was performed with monopolar electrocautery in the control group (n = 64) and with a tissue sealing-cutting device in the study group (n = 64). Data regarding wound healing, demographic variables, history, physical examination findings, defect dimensions, and scores for a visual analog scale were recorded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main outcomes measured were surgical site infection, early wound failure (dehiscence), and unhealed wound rate. RESULTS : Wound infection and dehiscence rates were significantly lower (P = .01 and .02), but the duration of surgery was significantly longer (P < .01) in the tissue sealing-cutting group. The unhealed wound rate was 12.5% in the electrocautery group and 4.7% in the tissue sealing-cutting group (P = .01). When the distance from the lowest margin to the anus was 5 cm or less, wound infection and dehiscence rates were lower in the tissue sealing-cutting group (P < .01 and .03). LIMITATIONS We could not obtain data regarding the cost-effectiveness of the instruments.

130388,Palliative medicine in the emergency department: symptom control and aggressive care.,2021-09-01,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly being used to document species distributions and habitat use in marine systems, with much of the recent effort focused on leveraging advances in next-generation DNA sequencing to assess and track biodiversity across taxonomic groups. Environmental DNA offers a number of important advantages over traditional survey techniques, including non-invasive sampling, sampling where traditional approaches are impractical or inefficient (e.g. deep oceans), reduced cost, and increased detection sensitivity. However, eDNA applications are currently limited because of an insufficient understanding of the influence of sample source, analytical approach, and marker type on eDNA detections. Because approaches vary considerably among eDNA studies, we present a summary of the current state of the field and emerging best practices. The impact of observed variation in rates of eDNA production, persistence, and transport are also discussed and future research needs are highlighted with the goal of expanding eDNA applications, including the development of statistical models to improve the predictability of eDNA detection and quantification.","Eble, Jeff A; Daly-Engel, Toby S; DiBattista, Joseph D; Koziol, Adam; Gaither, Michelle R",Advances in marine biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.amb.2020.01.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32600544/,557
130810,"Facial Personal Protective Equipment: Materials, Resterilization Methods, and Management of Occupation-Related Dermatoses.",2020-12-01,"PURPOSE [18F]FHBG has been used as a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging tracer for the monitoring of herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk), a reporter gene for cell and gene therapy in humans. However, this tracer shows inadequate blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and, therefore, would be limited for accurate quantification of reporter gene expression in the brain. Here, we report the synthesis and evaluation of 9-(4-[18F]fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl)butyl)-2(phenylthio)-6-oxopurine ([18F]FHBT) as a new PET tracer for imaging reporter gene expression of HSV1-tk and its mutant HSV1-sr39tk, with the aim of improved BBB penetration. PROCEDURES [18F]FHBT was prepared by using a tosylate precursor and [18F]KF. The cellular uptake of [18F]FHBT was performed in HSV1-sr39tk-positive (+) or HSV1-sr39tk-negative (-) MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The specificity of [18F]FHBT to assess HSV1-sr39tk expression was evaluated by in vitro blocking studies using 1 mM of ganciclovir (GCV). Penetration of [18F]FHBT and [18F]FHBG across the BBB was assessed by dynamic PET imaging studies in normal mice. RESULTS The tosylate precursor reacted with [18F]KF using Kryptofix2.2.2 followed by deprotection to give [18F]FHBT in 10 % radiochemical yield (decay-corrected). The uptake of [18F]FHBT in HSV1-sr39tk (+) cells was significantly higher than that of HSV1-sr39tk (-) cells. In the presence of GCV (1 mM), the uptake of [18F]FHBT was significantly decreased, indicating that [18F]FHBT serves as a selective substrate of HSV1-sr39TK. PET images and time-activity curves of [18F]FHBT in the brain regions showed similar initial brain uptakes (~ 12.75 min) as [18F]FHBG (P > 0.855). Slower washout of [18F]FHBT was observed at the later time points (17.75 - 57.75 min, P > 0.207). CONCLUSIONS Although [18F]FHBT showed no statistically significant improvement of BBB permeability compared with [18F]FHBG, we have demonstrated that the 2-(phenylthio)-6-oxopurine backbone can serve as a novel scaffold for developing HSV1-tk/HSV1-sr39tk reporter gene imaging agents for additional research in the future.","Fuchigami, Takeshi; Haywood, Tom; Gowrishankar, Gayatri; Anders, David; Namavari, Mohammad; Wardak, Mirwais; Gambhir, Sanjiv Sam",Molecular imaging and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11307-020-01517-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691392/,557

Twenty-four multiparous Holstein dairy cows, at 8 wk before parturition, were divided into 4 equal groups, namely control (Ctrl), vitamin E (VE), selenium (Se), and vitamin E plus selenium (VE + Se) groups. On a daily basis, VE and Se cows received dietary 1.5 IU vitamin E/kg BW and 0.3 mg/kg DM selenium, respectively, from 8 wk before to 3 wk after parturition. Vitamin E plus selenium group received doses similar to VE and Se groups. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated through intravenous glucose tolerance test (ivGTT) at weekly intervals from 3 wk before to 3 wk after parturition. Serum concentrations of total antioxidant status (TAS), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), and beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) were assayed weekly before the commencement of ivGTT. Based on the results of ivGTT, the lowest and the highest degrees of insulin sensitivity were detected in Ctrl and VE + Se groups, respectively. The highest and the lowest concentrations of NEFA and BHBA were observed in Ctrl and VE + Se groups, respectively. Total antioxidant status, SOD, and GPx values were significantly lower in Ctrl cows and significantly higher in VE + Se-received cows compared with other groups. However, MDA values in Ctrl and VE + Se cows were significantly higher and lower than the other groups, respectively. Collectively, our results show that dietary administration of vitamin E and selenium ameliorates oxidative stress and lipid mobilization and increases insulin sensitivity in transition cows.","Chalmeh, A; Pourjafar, M; Badiei, K; Mirzaei, A; Jalali, M; Mazrouei Sebdani, M",Domestic animal endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.domaniend.2020.106602; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385859/,557

Programmes to promote FMS development have been primarily delivered in childcare settings. No studies have evaluated the effectiveness of an interactive digital application, designed to be co-used by parent and child, to increase FMS proficiency in preschool-aged children. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Moovosity™ programme, a novel digital application to increase FMS proficiency in 3- to 6-year-old children. Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted involving 34 parent-child dyads randomly assigned to either the 8-week intervention (n = 17) or wait-list control (n = 17) condition. FMS proficiency, PA, and parental support for PA was assessed at baseline and 8-weeks. Intervention participants were given free access to the app over a period of 8 weeks. Wait-listed controls were given access after the 8-week period. Group differences for pre to post changes in outcomes were tested for significance using general linear mixed models. Results: There was a significant group by time interaction for object control skills (F1,32 = 10.81, P = 0.003). Intervention children exhibited significant improvements in object control skills, while children in the wait-list control group exhibited a modest decline. Intervention children also exhibited improvements in locomotor skills, while wait-listed controls exhibited minimal change; however, the group by time interaction fell outside the 0.05 level of significance (F1,32 = 3.15, P = 0.09). There were no significant intervention effects observed for child PA (F1,32 = 0.03, P = 0.86) and parental support for PA (F1,32 = 0.84, P = 0.37). Conclusions: An 8-week exposure to a digital application to promote motor competence within a family environment was effective in improving FMS proficiency in preschool-aged children. The results warrant further investigation in larger trials.","Trost, Stewart G; Brookes, Denise S K",Journal of sports sciences,https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2020.1826657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985373/,557

What does face-to-face interaction accomplish that cannot be done remotely? What do family physicians offer that cannot be accomplished by technology? More than just relationship, family medicine brings the therapeutic use of the self to engage with people, an ability to advocate for patients, and the ability to step back and reflect on the power of relationships.

138720,TB and COVID-19: paying attention to diabetes mellitus.,2021-06-02,"BACKGROUND Although recent reports demonstrate large series of single-incision cholecystectomies, few articles compare single-incision data with traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) data. This article compares a large series of single-incision cholecystectomies to a series of traditional LCs performed at an urban tertiary-care center. METHODS A consecutive series of single-incision cholecystectomies was performed from August 2008 to March 2010. All cholecystectomies were attempted through a single incision on an intent-to-treat basis. Patient demographics, including height, weight, body mass index (BMI), pathologic diagnosis, ASA classification, operative time, complications, narcotic use, and length of stay (LOS), were recorded. Data for a matched cohort of patients undergoing a traditional four-port LC were gathered over a similar time period. Data were compared using a t test with a P<0.05 for significance. RESULTS Single-incision cholecystectomy was successful in 81 (76%) of 107 patients. The 26 (24%) converted cases showed a higher BMI (33.0±8.7 vs. 28.4±6.4 kg/m2, P<0.05) and longer operative times (98.3±33 vs. 76.1±23 min, P<0.003). Postoperatively, the converted patients had a longer LOS compared to that of the single-incision group (1.6±1.0 vs. 1.1±0.4 days, P=0.02). Overall, the single-incision group had longer operative times compared to the four-port LC group (81.5±28 vs. 69.1±21 min, P<0.004). However, after the tenth single-incision case, there was no difference in operative times. From a narcotic standpoint, the successful single-incision patients used significantly less narcotic versus the traditional LC group (20±22.7 vs. 32.3±31.2 mg, P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS The data suggests that individuals with a BMI over 33 may not be candidates for single-incision cholecystectomy. Those patients that undergo a successful single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy require fewer narcotics postoperatively and have a shorter LOS. Although this data is intriguing, the overall utility of single-incision procedures requires more analysis and potentially randomized trials.","Khambaty, Fatima; Brody, Fred; Vaziri, Khashayar; Edwards, Claire",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-011-0998-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21359686/,557

However, the fabrication of stable SEI layers is plagued by un-controlled structures, properties, and functions. Here a controllable design of an ordered LiF-rich and lithiophilic hybrid Janus interphase (LiF-HJI) is reported using organic fluorination reagent as a functional SEI precursor. The LiF-HJI with a lower crystalline LiF layer and an upper Li organosulfide layer provides high interfacial energy with the Li metal and strong Li-ion affinity, allows homogenous Li-ion distribution, fast and uniform Li-ion transport, and excellent mechanical and passivation properties, enabling stable Li metal anodes under harsh conditions, such as high deposition capacities (6 mA h cm-2 ), current densities (10 mA cm-2 ), and rates (5 C). Stable LiF-HJI@Li greatly improves cycling stability and capacity retention (80.1% after 300 cycles) of Li||LiNi0.8 Co0.1 Mn0.1 O2 cells at a commercial-level areal capacity (≈4.2 mA h cm-2 ).

142182,Inequalities in awareness and availability of bereavement services in North-East England.,2020-09-23,"PURPOSE The traditional Fletcher-Williamson tandem and ovoid brachytherapy applicators for treatment of cervical cancer have ovoid shields that reduce the dose to the bladder and rectum. However, these shields produce artifact on computed tomography (CT) that prevents acquisition of high-quality images. To address this limitation, we designed and tested a novel CT-compatible applicator with movable shields, called MDA(3). METHODS AND MATERIALS Fifteen patients with stage IB1-IIB cervical cancer requiring definitive radiation therapy were enrolled in a prospective pilot study to evaluate image quality with the MDA(3). Image quality was assessed by comparing an initial scan obtained with the shields shifted to minimize shield artifact to a second scan obtained with the shields in treatment position. The 2 scans were then compared by a radiation oncologist blinded to the image source. In addition, image quality was assessed by analysis of Hounsfield values in the normal tissues. RESULTS The MDA(3) was successfully employed for intracavitary brachytherapy in 15 patients. CT images obtained with the shields shifted were superior to CT images obtained with the shields in treatment position in every case as evaluated by the radiation oncologist (P < .0001). The presence of the shields in the treatment position significantly increased the mean Hounsfield values within the bladder (P = .002) and rectum (P = .001) due to high-density image artifact. CONCLUSIONS This novel applicator provides a clinically feasible solution to overcome the limitation of lack of ovoid shields on currently available CT-compatible applicators.","Klopp, Ann H; Mourtada, Firas; Yu, Z Henry; Beadle, Beth M; Munsell, Mark F; Jhingran, Anuja; Eifel, Patricia J",Practical radiation oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prro.2012.03.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24674314/,557

Despite its inherent limitations, telemedicine offers many advantages to both patient and physician as an alternative to in-person evaluation of select patients. In the near term, telemedicine allows nonpandemic care to proceed while observing appropriate public health concerns to minimize the spread of pandemic pathogens. Thus, it behooves practitioners to use telemedicine consultations for common otolaryngology complaints. Assessment of the dizzy patient is well-suited to an algorithmic approach that can be adapted to a telemedicine setting. As best practices for telemedicine have yet to be defined, we present herein a practical approach to the history and limited physical examination of the dizzy patient in the telemedicine setting for the general otolaryngologist. Indeed, once the acute crisis has abated, we suspect that this approach will continue to be an effective way to manage dizzy patients.","Chari, Divya A; Wu, Matthew J; Crowson, Matthew G; Kozin, Elliott D; Rauch, Steven D",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820935859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32600170/,557

METHODS Preclinical study: After administering (111)In-DTPAOC intra-venously (IV) or IA, biodistribution studies were performed in rats with a hepatic somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2)-positive tumor. Clinical study: 3 patients with neuroendocrine liver metastases were injected twice with (111)In-DTPAOC. The first injection was given IV, and 2 weeks later, the second was injected IA (hepatic artery). Planar images of the abdomen were made up to 72 hours after injection. Blood samples were taken and urine was collected. Pharmacokinetic modeling was performed on the IV and IA data of the same patient. Based on this model, additional (177)Lu dosimetry calculations for IV and IA administrations were performed. RESULTS The preclinical study showed a two-fold higher (111)In-DTPAOC tumor uptake after IA administration than after IV injection. Patient data showed a large variability in radioactivity increment in liver metastases after IA administration compared with IV administration. Renal radioactivity was not significantly lower after IA administration; (177)Lu dosimetry simulations in 1 patient using a maximum kidney radiation dose of 23 Gy showed IA administration resulted in a mean increase in tumor radiation dose of 2.9-fold. CONCLUSION Preclinical and clinical data both indicate that IA administration of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs via the hepatic artery can significantly increase radionuclide uptake in GEPNET, sst2-positive, liver metastases up to 72 hours postinjection, although the effect of IA administration can differ between patients.","Pool, Stefan E; Kam, Boen L R; Koning, Gerben A; Konijnenberg, Mark; Ten Hagen, Timo L M; Breeman, Woulter A P; Krenning, Eric P; de Jong, Marion; van Eijck, Casper H J",Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,https://doi.org/10.1089/cbr.2013.1552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24820805/,557

However, the definition of hypotension remains controversial in children. We sought to determine arterial blood pressure threshold values associated with cerebral desaturation in infants. METHODS After ethics committee approval, infants younger than 3 months were included in this prospective observational study. Cerebral saturation was assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy. The primary goal of the study was to determine percentage reductions in intraoperative systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mean blood pressure (MBP) associated with decreases in cerebral blood oxygen saturation of >20%, when compared to baseline. Analyses were performed using a bootstrap receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curves with determination of the gray zone. RESULTS Sixty patients were recruited and 960 measurement points were recorded. Fifty-nine data points (6.1%) recorded cerebral desaturation of >20% when compared to baseline. The areas under the ROC curves were 0.79 (0.74-0.84) and 0.67 (0.6-0.75) for percentage decreases in SBP and MBP, respectively. Gray zone values with false-positive and negative rates <10% were SBP decreases of 20.5% and 37.5%, respectively, and MBP decreases of 15.5% and 44.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that falls in noninvasive systolic blood pressure of <20% from baseline are associated with a <10% chance of cerebral desaturation in neonates and infants <3 months of age undergoing noncardiac surgery. As such, maintaining systolic blood pressure above this threshold value appears a valid clinical target.","Michelet, Daphné; Arslan, Ozkan; Hilly, Julie; Mangalsuren, Nyamjargal; Brasher, Christopher; Grace, Robert; Bonnard, Arnaud; Malbezin, Serge; Nivoche, Yves; Dahmani, Souhayl",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.12671; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25929346/,557
151530,Oncology to specialised palliative home care systematic transition: the Domus randomised trial.,2020-07-17,"Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are recognized respiratory pathogens. Some HCoV strains, including HCoV-OC43, can invade the central nervous system, where they infect neurons, with unclear consequences. We have previously reported that HCoV-OC43 infection of human neurons activates the unfolded-protein response and caspase-3 and induces cell death and that the viral spike (S) glycoprotein is involved in the process. We now report on underlying mechanisms associated with the induction of programmed cell death (PCD) after infection by the reference HCoV-OC43 virus (rOC/ATCC) and a more neurovirulent and cytotoxic HCoV-OC43 variant harboring two point mutations in the S glycoprotein (rOC/U(S183-241)). Even though caspase-3 and caspase-9 were both activated after infection, the use of caspase inhibitors neither reduced nor delayed virus-induced PCD, suggesting that these proteases are not essential in the process. On the other hand, the proapoptotic proteins BAX, cytochrome c (CytC), and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) were relocalized toward the mitochondria, cytosol, and nucleus, respectively, after infection by both virus variants. Moreover, LA-N-5 neuronal cells treated with cyclosporine (CsA), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeabilization transition pore (mPTP), or knocked down for cyclophilin D (CypD) were completely protected from rOC/ATCC-induced neuronal PCD, underlining the involvement of CypD in the process. On the other hand, CsA and CypD knockdown had moderate effects on rOC/U(S183-241)-induced PCD. In conclusion, our results are consistent with mitochondrial AIF and cyclophilin D being central in HCoV-OC43-induced PCD, while caspases appear not to be essential.","Favreau, Dominique J; Meessen-Pinard, Mathieu; Desforges, Marc; Talbot, Pierre J",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.06062-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22013052/,557

Two hundred and five X-ray security screeners participated in a questionnaire survey. The result showed that satisfaction with the VDT's physical features and the work environment conditions were negatively correlated with the intensity of visual fatigue, whereas job stress and job burnout had direct positive influences. The path coefficient between the image quality of VDT and visual fatigue was not significant. The total effects of job burnout, job stress, the VDT's physical features and the work environment conditions on visual fatigue were 0.471, 0.469, -0.268 and -0.251 respectively. These findings indicated that both extrinsic factors relating to VDT and workplace environment and psychological factors including job burnout and job stress should be considered in the workplace design and work organisation of security screening tasks to reduce screeners' visual fatigue. Practitioner Summary: This study identified the risk factors influencing visual fatigue in baggage X-ray security screeners and estimated the strength of correlations between those factors and visual fatigue. The findings were of great importance to the workplace design and the work organisation of security screening tasks to reduce screeners' visual fatigue.","Yu, Rui-Feng; Yang, Lin-Dong; Wu, Xin",Ergonomics,https://doi.org/10.1080/00140139.2016.1192226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27258596/,557

OBJECTIVE To define performance standards and predict the clinical, epidemiologic, and economic outcomes of nationwide, home-based antigen testing. DESIGN A simple compartmental epidemic model that estimated viral transmission, portrayed disease progression, and forecast resource use, with and without testing. DATA SOURCES Parameter values and ranges as informed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance and published literature. TARGET POPULATION U.S. population. TIME HORIZON 60 days. PERSPECTIVE Societal; costs included testing, inpatient care, and lost workdays. INTERVENTION Home-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing. OUTCOME MEASURES Cumulative infections and deaths, number of persons isolated and hospitalized, and total costs. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS Without a testing intervention, the model anticipates 11.6 million infections, 119 000 deaths, and $10.1 billion in costs ($6.5 billion in inpatient care and $3.5 billion in lost productivity) over a 60-day horizon. Weekly availability of testing would avert 2.8 million infections and 15 700 deaths, increasing costs by $22.3 billion. Lower inpatient outlays ($5.9 billion) would partially offset additional testing expenditures ($12.5 billion) and workdays lost ($14.0 billion), yielding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $7890 per infection averted and $1 430 000 per death averted. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Outcome estimates vary widely under different behavioral assumptions and testing frequencies. However, key findings persist across all scenarios, with large reductions in infections, mortality, and hospitalizations. Costs per death averted are roughly an order of magnitude lower than commonly accepted willingness-to-pay values per statistical life saved ($5 to $17 million). LIMITATIONS Analysis was restricted to at-home testing. There are uncertainties concerning test performance. CONCLUSION High-frequency home testing for SARS-CoV-2 with an inexpensive, imperfect test could contribute to pandemic control at justifiable cost and warrants consideration as part of a national containment strategy.

This may be due to frequency changes occurring in the EEG during development. Amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) is based primarily in the time domain and hence may have greater utility in infants. OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between age adjusted Minimal Alveolar Concentration (MAC) multiples and aEEG in children under 2 years of age. METHODS The aEEG, Spectral Edge Frequency 90% (SEF90) and Bispectral Index™ (BIS) were investigated in a prospective study of children <2 years of age. After anesthetic induction, and caudal block administration, EEG data were collected simultaneously with BrainZ BRM2™ and BIS™ monitors. Using a randomized crossover design, children received up to three age adjusted concentrations of sevoflurane: 0.75, 1 and 1.25 MAC. After 15 min of stable anesthetic delivery EEG readings were obtained. Prediction Probability (Pk ) and correlation coefficients were calculated for each EEG parameter. RESULTS From 51 children 102 stable anesthetics concentrations were obtained. For all age groups Pk of aEEG to multiple of age adjusted MAC was <0.72 indicating a poor predictive power for aEEG. In contrast for the SEF90 and BIS there was evidence for better predictive properties in children aged between 6 months and 2 years, with a Pk >0.81. CONCLUSION The aEEG is unlikely to be a useful measure of anesthesia depth in young children.","McKeever, Stephen; Johnston, Linda; Davidson, Andrew J",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.12366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612073/,557

Telemedicine is increasingly recognized as an attractive tool to alleviate resource strains. Herein we describe the rapid implementation and sequential process improvement (PI) of a centralized telehospitalist service to coordinate and optimize management of large number of COVID-19 patients in a tertiary and quaternary care hospital very close to the New York City epicenter. Methods: Prospective multidisciplinary PI meetings were held weekly between March 23 and May 10, 2020, and consensus service modifications were implemented for the following week. Inpatient census data, telehospitalist intervention volumes, and service utilization statistics were collected. Results/Discussion: Between March 23 and May 10, 2020, a total of 745 COVID-19 patients were admitted to the general medical wards. The telehospitalist service performed 1,136 audiovisual (AV) patient assessments, 379 best practice interventions, cohorted 108 patients, and conducted 170 remote family conversations. During the consecutive PI cycles, a number of adaptations in AV setup, care standardization, patient logistics, communication, and consultative functions were made to load balance the bedside hospitalist teams. As the COVID-19 hospital census increased to peak levels, the most value was added through facilitation of communication and collaboration between the bedside clinical teams, the infection prevention and control teams, and patient logistics team. Conclusions: A telehospitalist service can be rapidly implemented with basic telemedicine equipment. Processes/this functions can be sequentially adapted to quickly changing needs during conditions such as the COVID-19 pandemic that very quickly can place extraordinary strains on hospital resources.","Becker, Christian D; Forman, Leanne; Gollapudi, Lakshmi; Nevins, Brooke; Scurlock, Corey",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32804055/,557

Reply.,2020-06-26,"INTRODUCTION Adaptor-associated kinase 1 (AAK1) has been proposed as being a promising drug target for the treatment of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's disease and neuropathic pain. More recently, AAK1 was shown to be an essential cellular factor for viral replication and therefore has been pursued as a host target for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents. AREAS COVERED This review provides an overview of the patented AAK1 inhibitors from 2013 to present. EXPERT OPINION The promise of AAK1 as drug target for the treatment of neuropathic pain stimulated the search for AAK1 inhibitors. However, only two companies (i.e. Lexicon Pharmaceuticals and Bristol Myers Squibb) seemed to be active in this field and filed patent applications in the last few years. The most promising congeners showed promising in vitro activity in a variety of AAK1 related assays. Moreover, selected compounds were also endowed with in vivo activity in various preclinical animal models for neuropathic pain.","Martinez-Gualda, Belén; Schols, Dominique; De Jonghe, Steven",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,https://doi.org/10.1080/13543776.2021.1928637; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33971786/,557

In clinical practice, we observed bradycardia in some pediatric patients with CCHF during the clinical course. So we aimed to report CCHF cases that presented bradycardia during the clinical course and the relation of bradycardia with the clinical findings and ribavirin therapy. METHODS Charts of all hospitalized pediatric CCHF patients were reviewed with respect to age, sex, history of tick bite or history of removing a tick, other risk factors for CCHF transmission, and interval between the tick bite and the onset of symptoms. Outcomes and clinical and laboratory findings and medications were recorded for each patient. We searched the patient records for information regarding the existence of bradycardia. Bradycardia was accepted as the heart rate 2 standard deviations (SD) lower than the suspected heart rate based on age. RESULTS Fifty-two patients (mean age 11.2 ± 4.4 years, 31 female) were enrolled into the study. Bradycardia was seen in seven patients. Six patients with bradycardia were male and only one was female, and the mean age was 13.1 ± 1.6 years. It was observed that male gender is frequent among patients with bradycardia, as compared with those without bradycardia (p=0.01). Bleeding was found to be more frequent in patients with bradycardia (p=0.02). There were significant differences between the bradycardia and nonbradycardia groups with regard to the requirements for fresh frozen plasma transfusion, the number of platelet suspension given, requirement for intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and in the days of stay in hospital (p=0.01, p=0.03, p=0.03, p=0.04, respectively). CONCLUSION Reversible bradycardia might be seen in the clinical course of pediatric CCHF patients, and the clinicians must be aware of this finding. The possibility that ribavirin may potentiate bradycardia cannot be assessed without a placebo-control study. So further studies may help to reveal the cause of the bradycardia, the disease itself, or the ribavirin therapy. Hence this study supports the need for a randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess intravenous ribavirin in treating CCHF and to support approval of the drug.","Oflaz, Mehmet Burhan; Kucukdurmaz, Zekeriya; Guven, A Sami; Karapinar, Hekim; Kaya, Ali; Sancakdar, Enver; Deveci, Koksal; Gul, Ibrahim; Erdem, Alim; Cevit, Omer; Icagasioglu, F Dilara",Vector borne and zoonotic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2012.1200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24107209/,557

By comparing responses to COVID-19 in China and South Korea, this article argues that different political institutions affect countries’ responses to crises by shaping state capacity. First, the article proposes a state capacity-driven crisis management framework including four types of capacity: information capacity, decision-making and implementation capacity, coercive capacity, and mobilization and cooperation capacity. Second, the article contributes to the literature by making linkages between different forms of state capacity and regime type. Combinations of state capacity are different in democracies and authoritarian regimes because state capacities are shaped by two different institutional arrangements: central–local government relations and state–society relations. Additionally, the article finds that the impacts of political institutions on crisis management through different state capacities are contingent on scenarios such as the different stages of a crisis.","Mao, Yexin",International Political Science Review,https://doi.org/10.1177/0192512121994026,557

This pilot study, initiated in 2017, demonstrated how the innovative Internet Backpack could bring immediate connectivity and digital and physical (cyber-physical) resource-sharing including cognitive wireless networks to many school children simultaneously, much faster than previously thought possible, or affordable. Projecting from this successful pilot, in this paper we explain how we anticipate that the results will serve to focus further action by all stakeholders on the broadband underserved wherever they may be. We suggest utilizing the Internet Backpack to develop a gap-filling last few hundred feet road map of where broadband connectivity is otherwise lacking and hence hindering school children's education performance and opportunities to explore STEM learning topics. This model can guide future buildouts of broadband Internet and cyber-physical infrastructure to help address both the Covid-19 pandemic emergency and the ongoing, longstanding systemic societal emergencies exacerbated by limited Internet access in resource-constrained communities. Our initial pilot data shows improvement in both student scientific reasoning and science mastery when uninterrupted Internet connectivity is provided, allowing students to engage in both curricular and extracurricular science projects unimpeded by digital divides. Larger-scale studies, if replicating these results, could guide educators and policymakers towards utilizing cognitive systems such as the Internet Backpacks, and Science/IoT curricula, for efficient cloud to edge connectivity and innovative educational content, changing the equation for greater digital inclusion in urban and rural communities, quickly. © 2021 IEEE.","McKnight, L.

The study was aimed to assess the dynamic changes of the IL1 members (IL1 beta, IL1 alpha, IL1ra, IL18, IL18BP, IL37) blood levels in patients with EAH 10, 30, and 180 days after having COVID-19 in order to define cytokine-mediated mechanisms of EAH progression during the period following infection. The study involved four groups of patients: with a history of EAH and COVID-19 (pneumonia/no pneumonia), with a history of COVID-19 (pneumonia/no pneumonia) and no EAH. Cytokine levels were determined by enzyme immunoassay. The study results demonstrate the prolonged proinflammatory immune response during the period following infection in patients with EAH (retaining higher levels of IL1 beta, IL1 alpha, and IL18 on days 10, 30, and 180 after recovery (rho &lt; 0.001) compared to levels measured prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection). In the group with no EAH, the balance of assayed cytokines was restored on day 30 of follow-up. The two-fold increase of blood IL18 levels in patients, having a history of EAH and COVID-19 and showing no increase in the IL18BP levels after 30 days of follow up compared to the values measured prior to infection, is associated with cardiovascular complications occurring during the first six months of follow-up.

Apart from clinical severity of patients, a need for robust predictors was also felt for early categorization and accurate prediction of final fatal outcome in hospitalized patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD In this retrospective observational cohort study all the adult patients admitted during November month were included. Available data for epidemiological factors, inflammatory biomarkers and CT severity score were collected and analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to know predictive ability of each variable. A Receiver operating characteristic analysis was done to compare the predictive ability of each factor for final outcome of death. RESULTS We analyzed records of 735 total patients. Most of them were male (72.38%), have a median (IQR) age of 60 years (50-69). Diabetes (42.85%), and hypertension (39.86%) were the most common co-morbidities. After univariate and multivariate regression analysis we could find that CRP, D-Dimer and CT severity score levels only can predict final outcome of death. During multivariate regression and receiver operative characteristic (ROC) analysis also, age and Charlson's co-morbidity index failed to predict in hospital mortality. CRP and D-Dimer on admission positively predicts final outcome of in hospital mortality with AUROC of 0.749(p=0.007, CI 0.61-0.88), and 0.864(p= 0.000, CI 0.74-0.99) respectively. Whereas, CT severity score had AUROC 0.73 (p= 0.014, CI 0.575-0.83). Cut off for CRP was 45 mg/L (Sn 0.8, Sp 0.56), D-dimer was 1000 µg/L (Sn:0.8, Sp: 0.9), and CT severity score was 15 (Sn 0.8, Sp 0.58). CONCLUSION CRP level of 45 mg/l, D-dimer level of 1000 µg/L and CT severity level of >15 at the time of admission can be added to conventional clinical severity algorithm to more accurately predicting final outcome and stratifying the level of care offered at the time of admission, and hence may improve odds off survival.","Jain, Ashish; Kasliwal, Rajeev; Jain, Srishti Suresh; Gupta, Divyansh; Jain, Rohit; Jain, Anand; Jain, Ravi",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34472808/,557

Interstitial pneumonia characterized by mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration into alveolar septa were seen microscopically in all nine PRCV-infected pigs. Histopathologic changes were severe at DPI, modest at 10 DPI, and almost resolved at 15 DPI. PRCV antigen was not detected in bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium but was detected in interstitial macrophages in the lungs. This Korean isolate of PRCV appeared to replicate primarily within alveolar macrophages in the respiratory system of the pig.","Ahn, K; Chae, C; Kweon, C H",Veterinary pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9066087/,557

A series of non-pharmacological compounds, including supplements (oligoelements and vitamins), probiotics, and nutraceuticals, might affect the risk of COVID-19 or reducing clinical severity. Non-pharmacological remedies are easily available and usually have no relevant side effects. There is evidence that bacterial and molecular substances may potentiate the immune system against respiratory viruses. Moreover, these compounds might exert essential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity in COVID-19. Furthermore, nasal lavage may be an additional resource for reducing the viral load and restore the integrity of respiratory patency. Therefore, preventive courses using non-pharmacological remedies could be prescribed to reinforce the immune response and adequate treatment of upper respiratory infection with natural compounds could be considered a reasonable way to manage people in the pandemic COVID-19 era.","Ciprandi, G; Aragona, S E",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33426865/,557

METHODS: In a survey-based study in Lishui City, Zhejiang, China, pregnant women were recruited before (March-December, 2019; n = 2657) and during (January-August, 2020; n = 689) the COVID-19 pandemic. They completed the Symptom Check List-90 Revised (SCL90-R) questionnaire and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and were asked about their families via the Family Environment Scale (FES). RESULTS: Higher SCL90-R scores of somatization (P = 0.003), depression (P = 0.043), anxiety (P = 0.041), hostility (P = 0.009), and others (P = 0.025) were reported by women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sleep disorder also occurred more frequently among pregnant women during the pandemic (P = 0.002). Social environmental characteristics of families showed impaired family cohesion, and increased levels of conflict and independence during the pandemic (all P < 0.05). The FES score for family cohesion was negatively related with obsessive-compulsive, depression, anxiety, and hostility symptoms, whereas that for conflict was positively related with these symptoms (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The mental health, sleep, and family environment of pregnant women was impaired during the COVID-19 pandemic. Potential protective factors including increased social support might help to mitigate long-lasting negative consequences.","Xie, Miaomiao; Wang, Xiaoyun; Zhang, Jingjing; Wang, Yi",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,,557

Hand eczema is a difficult problem, especially since the start of the current COVID-19-pandemic, and can lead to absence due to illness at work. The main trio in the development of eczema is predisposition (atopy), irritation and allergy. Irritative contact dermatitis is caused by damage to the skin barrier. In dentistry, this is often caused by frequent contact with water, soaps, disinfectants and the use of gloves. The cause of allergic contact dermatitis is related to the use of various materials in oral care practice, such as acrylates, rubber and rubber additives. Essential measures are very important in oral care practice to prevent hand eczema. Various measures are key: adequate skin care with liniments, good skin protection with proper gloves and no-touch techniques. Knowledge of possible allergens and adequate hand hygiene and hand care are crucial to minimize the risk of chronic eczema.","Romijn-Bucarciuc, D; Maessen, G C; Visch, M B",Ned Tijdschr Tandheelkd,,557

Sometimes students do not even have a choice about online options, such as in the COVID-19 era, when the shift to remote instruction has happened and could happen at any time. Students need support for success in the online environment, yet many support models focus on the immediate problem rather than deeper root causes for the problem or misunderstanding. Traditional support models may use a ticketbased system that strives to quickly resolve the issue at hand. While the ticket-based system has some merit, there is a need for additional support via a technology coaching approach, which was influenced by writing center philosophies. This type of approach can focus on teaching students proper netiquette, appropriate techniques, and basic computer skills, which will enable them to succeed not just in a single online course but also in an online program or an eventual work environment. The article concludes with a discussion of collaboration and the importance of slow thinking, a concept inspired by the Slow Food movement which actively encourages problem solving and reflection.","McNeal, Lisa Gray Jennifer P.",Georgia Educational Researcher,,557

213297,Prevention and Treatment of Skin Damage Caused by Personal Protective Equipment: Experience of the First-Line Clinicians Treating 2019-nCoV Infection,2020,"One of the main and most effective measures to contain the recent viral outbreak is the maintenance of the so-called Social Distancing (SD). To comply with this constraint, workplaces, public institutions, transports and schools will likely adopt restrictions over the minimum inter-personal distance between people. Given this actual scenario, it is crucial to massively measure the compliance to such physical constraint in our life, in order to figure out the reasons of the possible breaks of such distance limitations, and understand if this implies a possible threat given the scene context. All of this, complying with privacy policies and making the measurement acceptable. To this end, we introduce the Visual Social Distancing (VSD) problem, defined as the automatic estimation of the inter-personal distance from an image, and the characterization of the related people aggregations. VSD is pivotal for a non-invasive analysis to whether people comply with the SD restriction, and to provide statistics about the level of safety of specific areas whenever this constraint is violated. We then discuss how VSD relates with previous literature in Social Signal Processing and indicate which existing Computer Vision methods can be used to manage such problem. We conclude with future challenges related to the effectiveness of VSD systems, ethical implications and future application scenarios.","Cristani, Marco; Bue, Alessio Del; Murino, Vittorio; Setti, Francesco; Vinciarelli, Alessandro",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04813v1.pdf,557

The lockdown data were compared with 2018 and 2019 observed data. PM10 values during lockdown were reduced by 3.75 to 4.5 times as compared with previous 2 years. Similarly, four-fold reduction of PM2.5 and SPM values was observed during lockdown. The gaseous pollutants like NO2 and O3 are within safe limit. Overall air quality index (AQI) improved significantly during lockdown. Similarly, there was drastic reduction in the majority of the nutrient parameters in the coastal water. Different heavy metal concentration in the coastal sediments samples also showed strong reduction during lockdown sampling in comparison with other two sampling. This proves that the coastal environment has its efficient self-cleaning potentials if there is considerable reduction in the anthropogenic as well as industrial activities. Diversity of phytoplankton and zooplankton also increased. The results were validated using statistical techniques like analysis of variance and least significance difference (LSD).","Chanchpara, Amit; Sonpal, Vasavdutta; Mehta, Gauravkumar; Sahoo, Tarini Prasad; Thorat, Ravikumar Bhagwan; Ray, Sanak; Haldar, Soumya",,,557

The clinical trials are underway for Remdesivir, an investigational anti-viral drug from Gilead Sciences. Antimalarial drugs such as Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine derivatives are being used in emergency cases; however, they are not suitable for patients with conditions like diabetes, hypertension and cardiac issues. The lack of availability of approved treatment for this disease calls forth the scientific community to find novel compounds with the ability to treat it. This paper evaluates the compound Andrographolide from Andrographis paniculata as a potential inhibitor of the main protease of SARS-COV-2 (Mpro) through in silico studies such as molecular docking, target analysis, toxicity prediction and ADME prediction. Andrographolide was docked successfully in the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Computational approaches also predicts this molecule to have good solubility, pharmacodynamics property and target accuracy. This molecule also obeys Lipinski's rule, which makes it a promising compound to pursue further biochemical and cell based assays to explore its potential for use against COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Macao was selected as the case not only because of the background of the authors, but also because Macao has been cited in many media coverage as a ""good practice"" example when it comes to fighting against this COVID-19 pandemic situation. Since there are already ample of articles on the background, development timeline, and overall commentary, this paper adopts a mixed approach by combining supplementary secondary data on the COVID-19 timeline in Macao (focusing on government interventions that can affect the tourism and hospitality industry) and primary qualitative in-depth interviews with senior management personnel (holding positions of Director or above) from major integrated resorts in Macao to get insights on industry strategic responses and expectation on future. A total of seven interviews were conducted with senior management members of five integrated resorts in May 2020. Four areas of responses were identified. They are 1. Survival; 2. The New Business Norm; 3. Business Rebound Strategies and 4. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The findings indicate a seemingly utopian scenario among the major integrated resorts and gaming concessionaires in Macao towards their compliance and autonomous actions. The mechanism of this utopian-like scenario is explained by adopting the neo-institutional theory.","Loi, Kim Ieng; Lei, Weng Si; Lourenço, Fernando",Int J Hosp Manag,,557

O objetivo neste trabalho foi avaliar características de desempenho, carcaça e qualidade da carne de ovinos de diferentes grupos genéticos, desmamados aos 60 ou 90 dias de idade, terminados em confinamento e abatidos com 32 ou 38 kg de peso corporal. Foram utilizados 167 cordeiros machos, não castrados, recém desmamados, pertencentes aos grupos genéticos (GG) Santa Inês (S), Dorper (D), Ile de France (I), Texel (T), ½ D + ½ S, ½ I + ½ S e ½ T + ½ S. Os animais foram distribuídos em quatro tratamentos, constituídos por duas idades ao desmame (ID), 60 ou 90 dias, e dois pesos de abate (PA), 32 kg ou 38 kg de peso corporal. Os animais foram pesados semanalmente até atingirem o peso de abate. Após o abate, as carcaças foram pesadas e acondicionadas em câmara frigorífica (2 ºC) por 24 horas. Após esse período, foram realizadas as medidas morfométricas no lado esquerdo de cada carcaça e separação dos cinco cortes comerciais. Na costela do lado esquerdo de cada carcaça, foram realizadas as análises de área de olho de lombo (AOL), espessura de gordura externa (EG) e cor da gordura (L*, a* e b*). Após a separação do músculo longissimus thoracis foram coletadas amostras de 2,5 cm para as análises de cor da carne (L*, a* e b*), capacidade de retenção de água (CRA), potencial hidrogeniônico (pH), perda de peso por cocção (PPC), sarcômero (SARC), força de cisalhamento (FC) e sensorial. Os dados do consumo de matéria seca, desempenho, qualidade da carcaça e da carne, análise descritiva (AD) e aceitação global (AG) foram analisados, utilizando-se o procedimento Mixed do SAS, em que o modelo estatístico para os dados do consumo de matéria seca, desempenho, qualidade da carcaça e da carne incluiu os efeitos fixos de GG, ID, PA, as interações GG-ID, GG-PA, ID-PA e GG-ID-PA e o resíduo, e o modelo estatístico para as análises de AD e AG incluiu o efeito fixo de GG e os efeitos aleatórios de sessão e provador, além do resíduo. Para a análise check all that apply (CATA), foi utilizando o procedimento Logistic do SAS, com modelo que incluiu o efeito fixo de GG, em que 1(um) representava a ocorrência (sim) do evento e 0 (zero) a não ocorrência do evento. Além disso, foi realizada análise fatorial múltipla no programa XLSTAT. O GG apresentou efeito sobre o consumo de matéria seca total (CMST), tempo de permanência no confinamento (TC), conversão alimentar (CA) e ganho de peso diário (GPD). Interação significativa ID-PA foi verificada para consumo de matéria seca diária (CMSD). Maior CMST foi observado para os animais Santa Inês, ½ I + ½ S e ½ T + ½ S, enquanto que os animais Texel e Ile de France apresentaram maior GPD e CA. GG e PA apresentaram efeito significativo sobre os pesos e os rendimentos de carcaça quente e fria, EG e AOL, enquanto ID não apresentou efeito significativo para nenhuma dessas características. Interação GG-PA foi observada para EG e AOL. Os animais ½ D + ½ S apresentaram valores intermediários entre os Santa Inês e Dorper para peso e rendimento da carcaça. Efeitos significativos de GG e PA foram verificados para todas as características morfométricas, exceto para profundidade do braço (PROFB). Os animais Santa Inês apresentaram maiores comprimento externo e interno, profundidade da carcaça e comprimentos de perna e de braço. Efeitos significativos de GG foram observados para todos os pesos e rendimentos dos cortes da carcaça. Maiores peso e porcentagem de perna foram obtidos pelos animais Texel. O abate de animais com 38 kg de peso proporcionou melhores características da carcaça, além de melhores pesos dos cortes comerciais. Houve efeito de GG sobre as características de cor da carne (L* e b*) e cor da gordura (a* e b*). ID não teve efeito significativo sobre as características de cor da carne e da gordura. Efeito significativo de PA foi observado apenas para o a*_gord. Interação significativa GG-ID foi verificado para a*_carne e b*_carne, enquanto que interação significativa ID-PA foi observada apenas para b*_gord. Não houve efeito significativo de GG para nenhum dos atributos avaliados na AD, CATA e AG. Em geral, nenhum grupo genético apresentou características de qualidade que depreciam o valor da carne ovina, sendo assim, é possível a utilização de qualquer dos grupos genéticos nos sistemas de produção de ovinos, quanto a essas características.","BRITO, GERLANE FERREIRA DE",,,557

Herein, in-silico drug discovery approaches have been utilized to identify potential natural products (NPs) as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (Mpro) inhibitors. The MolPort database that contains over 100,000 NPs was screened and filtered using molecular docking techniques. Based on calculated docking scores, the top 5,000 NPs/natural-like products (NLPs) were selected and subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations followed by molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding energy calculations. Combined 50 ns MD simulations and MM-GBSA calculations revealed nine potent NLPs with binding affinities (&#916;Gbinding ) > -48.0 kcal/mol. Interestingly, among the identified NLPs, four bis([1,3]dioxolo)pyran-5-carboxamide derivatives showed &#916;Gbinding > -56.0 kcal/mol, forming essential short hydrogen bonds with HIS163 and GLY143 amino acids via dioxolane oxygen atoms. Structural and energetic analyses over 50 ns MD simulation demonstrated NLP-Mpro complex stability. Drug-likeness predictions revealed the prospects of the identified NLPs as potential drug candidates. The findings are expected to provide a novel contribution to the field of COVID-19 drug discovery. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

After forced molting, 180 commercial laying hens were distributed in a completely randomized design with 5 treatments, 6 replications, and 6 hens for experimental unit. Five isoproteinic (18.68% CP), isoenergetic (2,900.00 kcal ME/kg), isophosphoric (0.46% aP) diets with 3.50%, 3.80%, 4.10%, 4.40% and 4.70% calcium were served. No effects (P > 0.05) of calcium levels were found in the egg laying rate, ration consumption, food conversion and eggshell percentage. A linear increase (P 0.05) in specific weight was found with the increase of calcium levels. A quadratic effect (P 0.05) was found in calcium levels on egg weight. It may be concluded that up to 4.7% calcium may be used efficiently for post-molt commercial laying hens.","Rogério Boscolo, Wilson; Massamito Furuya, Wilson; José Baptista Barbosa, Maria; Eiko Murakami, Alice; Rossetto Barriviera Furuya, Valéria",Acta Sci.

However, the volume of remote work is unprecedented and creates opportunities for cyber attackers to penetrate home computers. Attackers have been leveraging websites with COVID-19 related names, dubbed COVID-19 themed malicious websites. These websites mostly contain false information, fake forms, fraudulent payments, scams, or malicious payloads to steal sensitive information or infect victims' computers. In this paper, we present a data-driven study on characterizing and detecting COVID-19 themed malicious websites. Our characterization study shows that attackers are agile and are deceptively crafty in designing geolocation targeted websites, often leveraging popular domain registrars and top-level domains. Our detection study shows that the Random Forest classifier can detect COVID-19 themed malicious websites based on the lexical and WHOIS features defined in this paper, achieving a 98% accuracy and 2.7% false-positive rate.","Pritom, M.

METHODOLOGY: Analytical study in which we correlated secondary data obtained from reports of the Ministry of Health and National Institute for Statistics and Informatic. The cumulative incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in 25 peruvian regions is reported, together with its relationnship with altitude levels during March-July 2020 using Pearsons correlation. We also aiming to assess the prevalence of diabetes, obesity and hypertension with altitude according to the ENDES 2018 data using Gamma statistics. RESULTS: COVID-19 maintained an inverse correlation with higher rates in the coastal regions and lower rates with increasing altitude in the cumulative incidence (Pearson = -0.8, p < 0.000) and mortality (Pearson = -0.77, p < 0.000), adjusted gender and age. The prevalence of diabetes and obesity showed the same inverse correlation trend with altitude (Gamma p < 0.000) but not hypertension (Gamma p = 0.13) CONCLUSIONS: The data in Peru it is suggested that physiological adaptation in a hypoxic environment at high altitude may protect persons from the severe impact of acute infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. The reduction in cumulative incidence and mortality rates with increasing altitude is the main finding. Possible mechanisms such as a decreased expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and a lower virulence because of a high altitude environment, may explain this epidemiological features. In addition, the lower prevalence of diabetes, obesity and hypertension may establish a protective epidemiology against these disease.","Seclén, Segundo N; Nunez-Robles, Eloisa; Yovera-Aldana, Marlon; Arias-Chumpitaz, Arturo",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,557
245847,Reducing transmission of COVID-19 using a continuous negative pressure operative field barrier during oral maxillofacial surgery,2020,"BACKGROUND: In 2018, influenza and pneumonia was the 8th leading cause of death in the United States (US). Since 1950, non-Hispanic blacks (NHB) have experienced higher rates of mortality than non-Hispanic whites (NHW). Previous studies revealed geographic variation in mortality rates by race. The identification of areas with the greatest disparity in influenza and pneumonia mortality may assist policy makers in the allocation of resources including for the COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does geographic variation in racial disparity in influenza and pneumonia mortality exist? STUDY DESIGN: and Methods: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) database for multiple cause of death between 1999-2018 for NHB and NHW decedents aged &#8805; 25 years with an ICD-10 code for influenza (J09-J11) and pneumonia (J12-J18) was used. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)were computed by race for Health & Human Services (HHS) regions and urbanization in non-Hispanics RESULTS: In 1999-2018, there were 540,476 deaths among NHB and NHW aged 25-84 years. AAMR was higher in NHB than NHW in each age group and in 7 of 10 HHS regions. The greatest disparity was in HHS regions 2 (NY, NJ) and 9 (Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada). In HHS region 2, NHB [24.6 (95% CI 24.1-25.1)] were more likely to die than NHW [15.7 (95% CI 15.6-15.9)]. Similarly, in region 9, NHB [23.2 (95% CI 22.7-23.8)] had higher mortality than NHW [16.1 (95% CI 15.9-16.2)]. Within these regions, disparities were greatest in the core of major metropolitan areas. Much of the disparity was due to very high mortality rates in NHB in these areas: region 2 large central metro areas NHB 28.2 (95% CI 27.6-28.9). INTERPRETATION: In 1999-2018 the NHB-NHW disparity in AAMR from influenza and pneumonia was greatest in central metro areas of HHS regions 2 and 9.","Donaldson, Sahai V; Thomas, Alicia N; Gillum, Richard F; Mehari, Alem",Chest,,557

Though RNA viruses mutate more rapidly than DNA viruses, there are a relatively small number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that differentiate the main SARS-CoV-2 lineages that have spread throughout the world. In this study, we investigated 129 RNA-seq datasets and 6,928 consensus genomes to contrast the intrahost and interhost diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses yielded three major observations. First, the mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 highlights iSNV and SNP similarity, albeit with differences in C>U changes. Second, iSNV and SNP patterns in SARS-CoV-2 are more similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV-1. Third, a significant fraction of insertions and deletions contribute to the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Altogether, our findings provide insight into SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity, inform the design of detection tests, and highlight the potential of iSNVs for tracking the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Sapoval, Nicolae; Mahmoud, Medhat; Jochum, Michael; Liu, Yunxi; Elworth, R A Leo; Wang, Qi; Albin, Dreycey; Ogilvie, Huw; Lee, Michael D; Villapol, Sonia; Hernandez, Kyle; Maljkovic Berry, Irina; Foox, Jonathan; Beheshti, Afshin; Ternus, Krista; Aagaard, Kjersti; Posada, David; Mason, Christopher; Sedlazeck, Fritz J; Treangen, Todd J",Genome res,,557

254900,Early Acceleration of COVID-19 in Areas with Larger Nursing Homes and Certificate of Need Laws,2021,"Purpose: The events surrounding the COVID-19 crisis had a profound effect on higher education, forcing students and instructors to face a sudden transition to wholly online learning contexts. This paper aims to examine how the design of a residential course was adapted to an online context and how this adaptation may prove beneficial to future iterations of the course. Design/methodology/approach: This analysis centers on a master’s-level course in which students design software to support learning. One of the major changes to the course revolves around the transition from a traditional rubric-based grading scheme to a specifications grading system. This latter approach provides a series of binary (pass/fail) requirements (specifications) that students must meet to pass. Various forms of interactions were also altered during the transition; the authors investigate these in the paper. Findings: This study found that the move to specifications grading helped students and the instructor to focus on the important work of meeting course learning goals. The approach also aligned well with authentic scenarios in which software projects are tested against certain specifications. Finally, this study concludes that thinking about specifications grading in the future can help us to develop more resilient pedagogical design approaches that respond to various forms of disruptions and changes. Originality/value: The course design insights described in this paper illustrate alternative ways of instruction that can be especially useful during times of emergency, but which may also provide an added level of authenticity and learner motivation during times of stability.","Quintana, Rebecca; Quintana, Chris",inform.Learn.Sci,,557

Novel methods of oxygen delivery could mitigate that risk. Oxygen hoods/helmets may improve: O2-saturation (SaO2), reduce in-hospital mechanical ventilation and mortality rates, and reduce length of hospitalization in hypoxic Covid-19 patients failing on conventional high-flow oxygen delivery systems. METHODS: DesignProspective Controlled Cohort Study. SettingSingle Center. ParticipantsAll patients admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were reviewed and 136/347 patients met inclusion criteria. Study period3/6/2020 to 5/1/2020. 136 participants completed the study with known status for all outcome measures. Intervention or exposureOxygen hoods/helmets as compared to conventional high-flow oxygen delivery systems. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): 1) Pre and post change in oxygen saturation (SaO2). 2) In-hospital Mechanical Ventilation (MV). 3) In-hospital Mortality. 4) Length of hospitalization. RESULTS: 136 patients including 58-intervention and 78-control patients were studied. Age, gender, and other demographics/prognostic indicators were comparable between cohorts. Oxygen hoods averted imminent or immediate intubation/MV in all 58 COVID-19 patients failing on conventional high-flow oxygen delivery systems with a mean improvement in SaO2 of 8.8%, p < 0.001. MV rates were observed to be higher in the control 37/78 (47.4%) as compared to the intervention cohort 23/58 (39.7%), a difference of 7.7%, a 27% risk reduction, not statistically significant, OR 95%CI 0.73 (0.37-1.5). Mortality rates were observed higher in the control 54/78 (69.2%) as compared to the intervention cohort 36/58 (62.1%), a difference of 7.1%, a 27% risk reduction, not statistically significant OR 95%CI 0.73 (0.36-1.5). CONCLUSION: Oxygen hoods demonstrate improvement in SaO2 for patients failing on conventional high-flow oxygen-delivery systems and prevented imminent mechanical ventilation. In-hospital mechanical ventilation and mortality rates were reduced with the use of oxygen hoods but not found to be statistically significant. The oxygen hood is a safe, effective oxygen-delivery system which may reduce intubation/MV and mortality rates. Their use should be considered in treating hypoxic COVID-19 patients.

259489,27 Evaluating the role of the royal free london NHS foundation trust palliative care teams during the Covid-19 pandemic,2021,"This paper aims to propose a high-speed and accurate fully-automated method to detect COVID-19 from the patient's chest CT scan images. We introduce a new dataset that contains 48260 CT scan images from 282 normal persons and 15589 images from 95 patients with COVID-19 infections. At the first stage, this system runs our proposed image processing algorithm that analyzes the view of the lung to discard those CT images that inside the lung is not properly visible in them. This action helps to reduce the processing time and false detections. At the next stage, we introduce a novel architecture for improving the classification accuracy of convolutional networks on images containing small important objects. Our architecture applies a new feature pyramid network designed for classification problems to the ResNet50V2 model so the model becomes able to investigate different resolutions of the image and do not lose the data of small objects. As the infections of COVID-19 exist in various scales, especially many of them are tiny, using our method helps to increase the classification performance remarkably. After running these two phases, the system determines the condition of the patient using a selected threshold. We are the first to evaluate our system in two different ways on Xception, ResNet50V2, and our model. In the single image classification stage, our model achieved 98.49% accuracy on more than 7996 test images. At the patient condition identification phase, the system correctly identified almost 234 of 245 patients with high speed.","Rahimzadeh, Mohammad; Attar, Abolfazl; Sakhaei, Seyed Mohammad",Biomed Signal Process Control,,557

Objective: We investigated the risk and prevention of hospital transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to hospitalized urological patients. Design, setting, and participants: This is a retrospective study of 319 hospitalized urological patients enrolled between April 20, 2020 and May 11, 2020 from two tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, China. Intervention: Chest computed tomography (CT) images, nucleic acid tests (NATs), and serum antibody were examined at the outpatient department and 1 wk after admission for all patients. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The chest CT images, NATs, serum antibody results, and clinical data were collected and analyzed. Results and limitations: None of the 319 patients was found to be SARS-CoV-2 NAT positive. Ten and four patients were detected to be immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM positive, respectively. The chest CT features of 116 patients showed abnormal lung findings. During the 1-wk isolation, one patient initially being IgG positive only was found to be IgM positive, and another initially IgM-positive patient had a rising IgG level. Through risk assessment, we identified seven patients with very high and high risk for hospital transmission, and delayed the surgery while maintaining close follow-up. Five intermediate-risk patients were operated on successfully under paravertebral block or epidural anesthesia to avoid opening the airway with endotracheal intubation. The remaining 104 low-risk and 203 normal patients underwent normal surgery. Conclusions: Of the 319 patients, seven were identified as very high and high risk, which reinforced the importance of epidemic surveillance of discharged COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic infections. Five intermediate-risk patients were operated on successfully under regional anesthesia. Patient summary: Our experience of risk assessment and management practice may provide a strategy to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission to hospitalized urological patients after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Peng, Ejun; Xia, Ding; Gao, Wenxi; Zhan, Ying; Yang, Huan; Yang, Xiaoqi; Xu, Hua; Qu, Xiaoling; Sun, Jie; Wang, Shaogang; Ye, Zhangqun; Tang, Kun; Chen, Zhiqiang",Eu.

265236,3 The use of online videoconferencing for focus groups in palliative care research,2021,"There are many factors that influence community participation of individuals with serious mental illnesses. Research often focuses on barriers to participation. This study, however, takes a different approach, by exploring features of community locations considered welcoming by individuals with serious mental illnesses. This is important because welcoming environments are more likely to promote community participation. Using a survey approach, 75 participants were asked to identify and describe locations where they felt welcomed as a person with a mental illness. Our findings suggest that there are a number of places within the general community individuals with serious mental illnesses perceive as welcoming. Participants described religious communities, restaurants/cafés shops, parks, libraries, and cultural centers. Welcoming places were often perceived as architecturally open, featuring natural light and plants. Places provided opportunities for individuals to engage in a number of activities (e.g., socializing, entertainment, improving health, among others); data suggest welcoming places facilitated reciprocal relationships. We link these findings to a number of key recovery principles and make recommendation for multilevel interventions. This study may facilitate conversations with mainstream community organizations about inclusion and strategies to create welcoming environments and with mental health providers to consider strategies to encourage participation in welcoming places.

268464,Self-Centering Second-Generation Patient-specific Functionalized Implants for Deep Orbital Reconstruction,2020,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare a conventional medical treatment model with a telehealth platform for Maternal Fetal Medicine (MFM) outpatient care during the global novel coronavirus pandemic. METHODS: In this study, we described the process of converting our MFM clinic from a conventional medical treatment model to a telemedicine platform. We compared clinical productivity between the two models. Outcomes were analysed using standard statistical tests. RESULTS: We suffered three symptomatic COVID-19 infections among our clinical providers and staff prior to the conversion, compared with none after the conversion. We had a significant decrease in patient visits following the conversion (53.35 visits per day versus 40.3 visits per day, p < 0.0001). However, our average daily patient visits per full-time equivalent (FTE) were only marginally reduced (11.1 visit per FTE versus 7.6 visits per FTE, p < 0.0001), resulting in a relative decrease in adjusted work relative value units (6987 versus 5440). There was an increase in more basic follow-up ultrasound procedures, complexity (current procedural technology [CPT] code 76816 (10.7% versus 19.5%, relative risk [RR] 1.81, 95% CI 1.60-2.05, p < 0.0001)) over comprehensive follow-up ultrasound procedures, CPT code 76805 (17.2% versus 7.8%, RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.39-0.53, p < 0.0001) after conversion. Despite similar proportions of new consults, there was an increase in the proportion of follow-up visits and medical decision-making complexity evaluation and management CPT codes (e.g. 99214/99215) after the conversion (17.2% versus 24.6%, RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.26-163, p < 0.0001). There were no differences between amniocentesis procedures performed between the two time periods (0.3% versus 0.2%, p = 0.5805). CONCLUSION: The rapid conversion of an MFM platform from convention medical treatment to telemedicine platform in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic resulted in protection of healthcare personnel and MFM patients, with only a modest decrease in clinical productivity during the initial roll-out. Due to the ongoing threat from the novel coronavirus-19, an MFM telemedicine platform is a practicable and innovative solution and merits the continued support of CMS and health care administrators.","Shields, Andrea D; Wagner, Richard K; Knutzen, Dana; Deering, Shad; Nielsen, Peter E",J Telemed Telecare,,557
270785,Personal protective equipment (PPE) and infection among healthcare workers - What is the evidence?,2020,"Social media platforms facilitate mankind a data-driven world by enabling billions of people to share their thoughts and activities ubiquitously. This huge collection of data, if analysed properly, can provide useful insights into people's behavior. More than ever, now is a crucial time under the Covid-19 pandemic to understand people's online behaviors detailing what topics are being discussed, and where (space) and when (time) they are discussed. Given the high complexity and poor quality of the huge social media data, an effective spatio-temporal topic detection method is needed. This paper proposes a tensor-based representation of social media data and Non-negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) to identify the topics discussed in social media data along with the spatio-temporal topic dynamics. A case study on Covid-19 related tweets from the Australia Twittersphere is presented to identify and visualize spatio-temporal topic dynamics on Covid-19.","Balasubramaniam, T.; Nayak, R.; Bashar, M.

Here, we addressed the role of Î³Î´ T cells and intestinal microbiome in PM-induced acute neutrophilia. Î³Î´ T cells are a heterogeneous population composed of TÎ³Î´1, TÎ³Î´2, TÎ³Î´17, and naïve Î³Î´ T cells (TÎ³Î´N) and commensal bacteria promote local expansion of TÎ³Î´17 cells, particularly in the lung and gut without affecting their VÎ³ repertoire. TÎ³Î´17 cells are more tissue resident than TÎ³Î´1 cells, while TÎ³Î´N cells are circulating cells. IL-1R expression in TÎ³Î´17 cells is highest in the lung and they outnumber all the other type 17 cells such as Th17, ILC3, NKT17, and MAIT17 cells. Upon PM exposure, IL-1ß-secreting neutrophils and IL-17-producing TÎ³Î´17 cells attract each other around the airways. Accordingly, PM-induced neutrophilia was significantly relieved in Î³Î´ T- or IL-17-deficient and germ-free mice. Collectively, these findings show that the commensal microbiome promotes PM-induced neutrophilia in the lung via TÎ³Î´17 cells.","Yang, Chorong; Kwon, Dong-Il; Kim, Mingyu; Im, Sin-Hyeog; Lee, You Jeong",Front Immunol,,557

Resurgences of COVID-19 have also been observed in many other countries. In Guangzhou, China, a small outbreak, involving less than 100 residents, emerged in March and April 2020, and comprehensive and near-real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted. When the numbers of confirmed cases among overseas travelers increased, public health measures were enhanced by shifting from self-quarantine to central quarantine and SARS-CoV-2 testing for all overseas travelers. In an analysis of 109 imported cases, we found diverse viral variants distributed in the global viral phylogeny, which were frequently shared within households but not among passengers on the same flight. In contrast to the viral diversity of imported cases, local transmission was predominately attributed to two specific variants imported from Africa, including local cases that reported no direct or indirect contact with imported cases. The introduction events of the virus were identified or deduced before the enhanced measures were taken. These results show that the interventions were effective in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and they ruled out the possibility of cryptic transmission of viral variants from the first wave in January and February 2020. Our study provides evidence and emphasizes the importance of controls for overseas travelers in the context of the pandemic and exemplifies how viral genomic data can facilitate COVID-19 surveillance and inform public health mitigation strategies.","Jia, Hong-Ling; Li, Peng; Liu, Hong-Jie; Zhong, Jia-Yong; Qin, Peng-Zhe; Su, Wen-Zhe; Zheng, Ying-Feng; Li, Kui-Biao; Zeng, Qing; Li, Jin-Hui; Li, Li-Zhong; Cao, Lan; Wu, Ji-Bin; Chen, Yi-Yun; Jia, Lei-Li; Song, Hong-Bin; Zhang, Qi-Wei; Yang, Guang; Jing, Chun-Xia; Bo, Xiao-Chen; Zhang, Zhou-Bin; Di, Biao; Xiao, Chuan-Le; Ni, Ming",J. clin. microbiol,,557

The main objectives of the present Italian multi-center study were to describe clinical characteristics and role of selected prognostic predictors in a large cohort of young and middle-aged hospitalized patients. Nine pulmonology units, across north and center of Italy, were involved in this retrospective study. Comorbidities were classified according to their known or potential association with COVID-19. A total of 263 subjects were included. The prevalence of obesity was 25.9%, mechanical ventilation (MV) was needed in 27.7%, and 28 in-hospital deaths occurred (10.6%). Obesity and older age were the only independent, significant predictors for MV. Comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma, and increased D-dimer levels were significantly associated with higher mortality risk, regardless of age, body mass index, and MV. Obesity in young and middle-aged adults is a strong predictor of a more complicated COVID-19, without, however, evidence of a significant effect on in-hospital mortality. Selected comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes and asthma, significantly impact survival even in a younger population, suggesting the need for prompt recognition of these conditions.","Bonifazi, Martina; Mei, Federico; Skrami, Edlira; Latini, Lara Letizia; Amico, Donatella; Balestro, Elisabetta; Bini, Francesco; Bonifazi, Floriano; Caminati, Antonella; Candoli, Piero; Cinti, Saverio; Contucci, Susanna; Di Marco Berardino, Alessandro; Harari, Sergio; Levi, Guido; Lococo, Sara; Menditto, Vincenzo; Marchetti, Giampietro; Piciucchi, Sara; Poletti, Venerino; Ravaglia, Claudia; Saetta, Marina; Svegliati-Baroni, Gianluca; Tomassetti, Sara; Tamburrini, Mario; Zanforlin, Alessandro; Zuccon, Umberto; Zuccatosta, Lina; Gasparini, Stefano; Carle, Flavia",,,557

A note of caution,2021,"This work aims to explore the epidemiological status of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and assemblage of various plant species that have prophylactic or therapeutic potentials on the disease. Epidemiological data were obtained from various health authorities worldwide and articles (totaling 103) published in standard journals from 2002-2020 on medicinal plants used in treating the disease and similar diseases. Epidemiological records of COVID-19 regional epidemic in Africa as of 29th July, 2020 indicated South Africa as the epicenter of the disease;its continental index case was in Egypt on 14th February, 2020. This was transmitted via an individual with traveling history from highly COVID burdened nations. Recent records revealed that the new cases of the disease have started trending locally with a person to person contact especially among those without travel history. There were about 874,036 cases in Africa with about 18,498 deaths recorded within the time frame of this study. The age groups mostly affected were 20-49 years with males’ frequency marginally surpassing that of females. Seventy-five medicinal plant species from 41 families were recorded. Identified plants are indigenous to both the tropical and subtropical regions. Their medicinal potentials for treating human viral diseases are well described in Africa. Family Lamiaceae have the highest number of plant species (14.6%) used in managing COVID-19 and other related diseases. Asteraceae (12.3%) and Apiaceae (9.7%) families ranked second and third, respectively. Further studies on these plants with promising anti-SARS-CoV 2 properties on different experimental models for subsequent development of nutraceuticals and herbal medicine is imperative.","Adeniran, L.

Most meibum lipids are neutral, including wax esters (WEs), cholesteryl esters (CEs), and diesters (DEs), along with some polar lipids including free fatty acids (FFAs), O-acyl-&#969;-hydroxy fatty acids (OAHFAs), and trace phospholipids. Detection of neutral lipids by mass spectrometry (MS) is challenging due to interference from impurities, particularly when working with minute-volume meibum samples. Here, we describe procedures for sample preparation and MS analysis of these elusive meibum lipids that can be used to examine dry eye disease mechanisms. Because the method described here minimizes impurity peaks for lipids generally, neutral and otherwise, it may be applied to high-sensitivity analysis of other biological samples.","Chen, Jianzhong",Methods Mol Biol,,557

Based on this, we present some emergency traffic control measures that are very urgent in the early stage of epidemic. Between cities, we strongly recommend blocking and controlling the flow of traffic in the early stage of epidemic. Inside a city, it is imperative to suspend the public transports, block all roads, restrict private cars, and close bridges and tunnels. Material isolation transfer stations are suggested to be established. A number of public transports should be organized to ensure transport of medical workers, patients, and daily necessities. We also give suggestions about the long-term planning and improvement methods.

282439,Sex Disparities in COVID-19 Mortality Vary Across US Racial Groups,2021,"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is frequently compared with influenza. The Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) conducts studies on the etiology and characteristics of U.S. hospitalized adults with influenza. It began enrolling patients with COVID-19 hospitalizations in March 2020. Patients with influenza were compared with those with COVID-19 in the first months of the U.S. epidemic. METHODS: Adults aged &#8805; 18 years admitted to hospitals in 4 sites with acute respiratory illness were tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19. Demographic and illness characteristics were collected for influenza illnesses during 3 seasons 2016-2019. Similar data were collected on COVID-19 cases admitted before June 19, 2020. RESULTS: Age groups hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 914) were similar to those admitted with influenza (n = 1937); 80% of patients with influenza and 75% of patients with COVID-19 were aged &#8805;50 years. Deaths from COVID-19 that occurred in younger patients were less often related to underlying conditions. White non-Hispanic persons were overrepresented in influenza (64%) compared with COVID-19 hospitalizations (37%). Greater severity and complications occurred with COVID-19 including more ICU admissions (AOR = 15.3 [95% CI: 11.6, 20.3]), ventilator use (AOR = 15.6 [95% CI: 10.7, 22.8]), 7 additional days of hospital stay in those discharged alive, and death during hospitalization (AOR = 19.8 [95% CI: 12.0, 32.7]).

Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 was implemented in March of 2020 at a major diagnostic hub in Bangkok, Thailand. Several virus lineages supposedly originated in many countries were found, and a Thai-specific lineage, designated A/Thai-1, has expanded to be predominant in Thailand. A virus sample in the SARS-CoV-2 A/Thai-1 lineage contains a frame-shift deletion at ORF7a, encoding a putative host antagonizing factor of the virus.","Joonlasak, Khajohn; Batty, Elizabeth M; Kochakarn, Theerarat; Panthan, Bhakbhoom; Kümpornsin, Krittikorn; Jiaranai, Poramate; Wangwiwatsin, Arporn; Huang, Angkana; Kotanan, Namfon; Jaru-Ampornpan, Peera; Manasatienkij, Wudtichai; Watthanachockchai, Treewat; Rakmanee, Kingkan; Jones, Anthony R; Fernandez, Stefan; Sensorn, Insee; Sungkanuparph, Somnuek; Pasomsub, Ekawat; Klungthong, Chonticha; Chookajorn, Thanat; Chantratita, Wasun",Virus Res,,557
285963,Assessment of Healthcare Workers' Levels of Preparedness and Awareness Regarding COVID-19 Infection in Low-Resource Settings,2020,"Following the declaration by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11 March 2020, that the global COVID-19 outbreak had become a pandemic, South Africa implemented a full lockdown from 27 March 2020 for 21 days. The full lockdown was implemented after the publication of the National Disaster Regulations (NDR) gazette on 18 March 2020. The regulations included lockdowns, public health measures, movement restrictions, social distancing measures, and social and economic measures. We developed a hybrid model that consists of a long-short term memory auto-encoder (LSTMAE) and the kernel quantile estimator (KQE) algorithm to detect change-points. Thereafter, we utilised the Bayesian structural times series models (BSTSMs) to estimate the causal effect of the lockdown measures. The LSTMAE and KQE, successfully detected the changepoint that resulted from the full lockdown that was imposed on 27 March 2020. Additionally, we quantified the causal effect of the full lockdown measure on population mobility in residential places, workplaces, transit stations, parks, grocery and pharmacy, and retail and recreation. In relative terms, population mobility at grocery and pharmacy places decreased significantly by −17,137.04% (p-value = 0.001 &lt;0.05). In relative terms, population mobility at transit stations, retail and recreation, workplaces, parks, and residential places decreased significantly by −998.59% (p-value = 0.001 &lt;0.05), −1277.36% (p-value = 0.001 &lt;0.05), −2175.86% (p-value = 0.001 &lt;0.05), −370.00% (p-value = 0.001&lt;0.05), and −22.73% (p-value = 0.001 &lt;0.05), respectively. Therefore, the full lockdown Level 5 imposed on March 27, 2020 had a causal effect on population mobility in these categories of places.","Whata, Albert Chimedza Charles",Machine Learning and Knowledge Extraction,,557
286615,COVID-19 and Dental Education in Pakistan,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 triggers a dysregulated innate immune system activation. As the mevalonate pathway (MVP) prevents the activation of inflammasomes and cytokine release and regulates endosomal transport, compromised signaling could be associated with the pathobiology of COVID-19. Prior transcriptomic studies of host cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection have not reported to date the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the MVP. In this study, we accessed public data sets to report in silico investigations into gene expression. In addition, we proposed candidate genes that are thought to have a direct association with the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and which may be dependent on signals derived from the MVP. Our results revealed dysregulation of genes involved in the MVP. These results were not found when investigating the gene expression data from host cells infected with H3N2 influenza virus, H1N1 influenza virus, or respiratory syncytial virus. Our manually curated gene set showed significant gene expression variability in A549 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, as per Blanco-Melo et al. data set (GSE147507). In light of the present findings, SARS-CoV-2 could hijack the MVP, leading to hyperinflammatory responses. Prompt reconstitution of this pathway with available agents should be considered in future studies.","Gomez Marti, Juan Luis; Wells, Alan; Brufsky, Adam M",J Med Virol,,557

Nevertheless, such gadgets have set aside some effort to introduce and use them, incurring huge costs. Another structure, COVID-19, for engineering and identification using mobile phone sensors along these lines of thought. This proposition can be easily placed because most radiologists only have various daily use needs for mobile phones. At the same standard, individuals will be able to use their mobile phones to infect the system for identification purposes.

Flap edema could be an important factor on flap losing. Hyaluronidase breaks down the hyaluronic acid existing in the connective tissue, which is involved on water homeostasis of intercellular ground substance, and may be important on increasing flap survival. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of hyaluronidase on improving cutaneuos flap survival in rats. Forty-two Wistar rats divided in four groups were included in this study. It was made a 7 x 2 cm random flap in the dorsal aspect of the animal. Three groups received post-operative treatment during four days. Group A (n=11) received 100 UI per day of hyaluronidase, group B (n=11) 50 UI per day and group C (n=10) received distilled water. Group D (n=10) was not treated. It was evaluated the necrosis area and those data were statistically analyzed. Necrosis rates on 7th day were 38,69% (±9,26) in the group A, 38,20% (±15,05) in the group B, 51,97% (±8,37) in the group C and 45,90% (±12,57) in the group D. There was found difference with statistical significance (p 0,05) between group A and B when compared with the group C. There was no statistical difference when compared groups A and B with group D. Hyaluronidase was found effective when the infiltration factor was involved and this suggests a spread effect on edema to be the provable mechanism on increasing of the cutaneous flap survival in rats.","Enrique Acevedo-Bogado, Cristhian; Bins-Ely, Jorge; d039, José; Acampora, Armando; d039,; Eça Neves, Rodrigo",Acta cir. bras.,,557

During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, policy makers and public health officials are using Rt to assess the effectiveness of interventions and to inform policy. However, estimation of Rt from available data presents several challenges, with critical implications for the interpretation of the course of the pandemic. The purpose of this document is to summarize these challenges, illustrate them with examples from synthetic data, and, where possible, make recommendations. For near real-time estimation of Rt, we recommend the approach of Cori and colleagues, which uses data from before time t and empirical estimates of the distribution of time between infections. Methods that require data from after time t, such as Wallinga and Teunis, are conceptually and methodologically less suited for near real-time estimation, but may be appropriate for retrospective analyses of how individuals infected at different time points contributed to the spread. We advise caution when using methods derived from the approach of Bettencourt and Ribeiro, as the resulting Rt estimates may be biased if the underlying structural assumptions are not met. Two key challenges common to all approaches are accurate specification of the generation interval and reconstruction of the time series of new infections from observations occurring long after the moment of transmission. Naive approaches for dealing with observation delays, such as subtracting delays sampled from a distribution, can introduce bias. We provide suggestions for how to mitigate this and other technical challenges and highlight open problems in Rt estimation.","Gostic, Katelyn M; McGough, Lauren; Baskerville, Edward B; Abbott, Sam; Joshi, Keya; Tedijanto, Christine; Kahn, Rebecca; Niehus, Rene; Hay, James A; De Salazar, Pablo M; Hellewell, Joel; Meakin, Sophie; Munday, James D; Bosse, Nikos I; Sherrat, Katharine; Thompson, Robin N; White, Laura F; Huisman, Jana S; Scire, Jérémie; Bonhoeffer, Sebastian; Stadler, Tanja; Wallinga, Jacco; Funk, Sebastian; Lipsitch, Marc; Cobey, Sarah",PLoS Comput Biol,,557

This study used organizational support theory to investigate the stress associated with the logistics of coverage early in the pandemic and how perceived organizational support played a role in either alleviating or adding to that stress. In total, 222 journalists responded to a survey sent out during the first few weeks of the stay-at-home orders issued across the United States. Results revealed varying degrees of logistical support provided by news organizations with nearly one quarter receiving no supplies, technology, or extra training at all. Greater perceived organizational support was associated with lower levels of stress and higher levels of work commitment. Female journalists and those who were younger and less experienced felt significantly more stress associated with pandemic coverage.

In the absence of data from randomized controlled clinical trials, a number of consensus guidelines and recommendations have been published to facilitate clinical decision-making on this issue. However, substantive differences exist between these guidelines which can be difficult for clinicians. This review briefly summarizes the major societal guidelines and compares their similarities and differences. A common theme in all of the recommendations is to take an individualized approach to patient management and a call for prospective randomized clinical trials to address important anticoagulation issues in this population.","Flaczyk, Adam; Rosovsky, Rachel P; Reed, Clay T; Bankhead-Kendall, Brittany K; Bittner, Edward A; Chang, Marvin G",Crit Care,,557
302208,A Duty to Plan: Proactive Goals of Care Conversations with Seriously Ill Veterans Who Test Positive for COVID-19,2021,"Sensory stimuli endow animals with the ability to generate an internal representation. This representation can be maintained for a certain duration in the absence of previously elicited inputs. The reliance on an internal representation rather than purely on the basis of external stimuli is a hallmark feature of higher-order functions such as working memory. Patterns of neural activity produced in response to sensory inputs can continue long after the disappearance of previous inputs. Experimental and theoretical studies have largely invested in understanding how animals faithfully maintain sensory representations during ongoing reverberations of neural activity. However, these studies have focused on preassigned protocols of stimulus presentation, leaving out by default the possibility of exploring how the content of working memory interacts with ongoing input streams. Here, we study working memory using a network of spiking neurons with dynamic synapses subject to short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity. The formal model is embodied in a physical robot as a companion approach under which neuronal activity is directly linked to motor output. The artificial agent is used as a methodological tool for studying the formation of working memory capacity. To this end, we devise a keyboard listening framework to delineate the context under which working memory content is (1) refined, (2) overwritten or (3) resisted by ongoing new input streams. Ultimately, this study takes a neurorobotic perspective to resurface the long-standing implication of working memory in flexible cognition.","Berberian, Nareg; Ross, Matt; Chartier, Sylvain",PLoS One,,557

This research analyzes the correlation between self-efficacy, creativity perception, and productive disposition towards academic performance using path analysis and was modeled in the form of regression equation. This study involved 108 students (35 males and 72 females) at a university in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia. The research instrument used was questionnaire of self-efficacy (11 items), creativity perception (15 items) and mathematical disposition (14 items). All research variable items had a Pearson correlation (r) greater than 0.25, so all items were said to be valid. The reliability coefficient of Cronbach's Alpha for self-efficacy, perceived creativity, and productive disposition were included in the high category. The results showed a correlation between self-efficacy and creativity perception with regard to productive disposition. There was also a direct correlation between self-efficacy and academic performance. Creativity perception did not show a direct influence on academic performance nor. Productive disposition had a direct influence on academic performance. There was a correlation between self-efficacy, creativity perception, and productive disposition of academic performance. Self-efficacy (happy to help other friends, dare to face criticism and challenges, and dare to compete to win a competition) had the largest contribution to academic performance while creativity perception (creative ideas must be sophisticated and complex, creative people have high curiosity, creative people find it difficult to accept different opinions from others, creativity can only be developed in certain people, and creativity comes over by chance) has the smallest one. These findings can be used as first step in understanding creative perception as a weak contribution to cognitive abilities about academic performance, even though creativity has an important role in developing mathematics performance. © 2021, Conscientia Beam.

The elderly, patients with comorbidities and solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are particularly at risk. We observed a low incidence of severe disease in our population and aimed to determine the outcomes of COVID-19 (disease severity/Intensive care unit [ICU] admissions/mortality) in SOT recipients. METHODS: All SOT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. Their demographic and clinical data were recorded from the hospital electronic system. Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 stages of disease severity: A= asymptomatic, B=mild, C=moderate, and D=severe. RESULTS: Of the 3052 SOT recipients, 67 were diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean age was 52 years and 69% were male. There were approximately 25% patients in stage A, 28% in stage B, 34% in stage C and 12% in stage D. Patients in stage C and D were older than those in A (p=0.04) or B (P=0.03). Lactic dehydrogenase (p <0.01) and D-dimer (p <0.01) levels were higher across the stages.Approximately 70% of patients were admitted for a median duration of 9 days and the median follow-up was 35 days. Acute kidney injury occurred in 19% of patients, and 45% required supplementary oxygen. The symptomatic patients were treated with Hydroxychloroquine (83%), Azithromycin (89%) and Tocilizumab (23%).

308434,Pregnancy and Access to Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder,2020,"BACKGROUND: The role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients remains unclear. Our study aims to analyze the outcomes and risk factors from patients treated with ECMO. METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective, single-center study includes 17 COVID-19 patients treated with ECMO. Univariate and multivariate parametric survival regression identified predictors of survival. Nine patients (53%) were successfully weaned from ECMO and discharged. The incidence of in-hospital mortality was 47%. In a univariate analysis, only four out of 83 pre-ECMO variables were significantly different; IL-6, PCT, and NT-proBNP were significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors. The Respiratory Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Survival Prediction (RESP) score was significantly higher in survivors. After a multivariate parametric survival regression, IL-6, NT-proBNP and RESP scores remained significant independent predictors, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.069 [95%-CI: 0.986-1.160], p= 0.016 1.001 [95%-CI: 1.000-1.001], p=0.012; and 0.843 [95%-CI: 0.564-1.260], p=0.040, respectively. A prediction model comprising IL-6, NT-proBNP, and RESP score showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87, with a sensitivity of 87.5% and 77.8% specificity compared to an AUC of 0.79 for the RESP score alone. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that ECMO is a potentially lifesaving treatment for selected critically ill COVID-19 patients. Considering IL-6 and NT-per-BNP, in addition to the RESP score, may enhance outcome predictions.","Zayat, Rashad; Kalverkamp, Sebastian; Grottke, Oliver; Durak, Koray; Dreher, Michael; Autschbach, Rüdiger; Marx, Gernot; Marx, Nikolaus; Spillner, Jan; Kersten, Alex",Artif. organs,,557

In this paper, we will discuss two paucisymptomatic patients with blood tests suggestive for SARS-CoV-2 infection but with repeated negative nasopharyngeal swabs and without typical features of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest high-resolution computed tomography. In these cases, lung ultrasound helped to raise clinical suspicion of COVID-19 pneumonia and facilitate diagnosis. LEARNING POINTS: During the current COVID-19 pandemic, lung ultrasound (LUS) is being used extensively to evaluate and monitor lung damage in infected patients.Several patients have been described with negative PCR swabs who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.Typical signs of interstitial pneumonia on LUS strongly indicate COVID-19 pneumonia, thus suggesting further investigation and invasive tests to confirm the diagnosis.","Giugno, Vincenza; Di Marzio, Giulia; Domanico, Andrea; Accogli, Esterita",Eur J Case Rep Intern Med,,557

However, the importance of social distancing has recently been highlighted during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the absence of vaccination, or when vaccine efficacy is poor, social distancing may help to curb the spread of new virus strains. However, both vaccination and social distancing are associated with various costs. It is critical to consider these costs in addition to the benefits of these strategies when determining the optimal rates of application of control strategies. We developed a game-theoretic epidemiological model that considers vaccination and social distancing under the assumption that individuals pursue the maximization of payoffs. By using this model, we identified the individually optimal strategy based on the Nash strategy when both strategies are available and when only one strategy is available. Furthermore, we determined the relative costs of control strategies at which individuals preferentially adopt vaccination over social distancing (or vice versa).","Choi, Wongyeong; Shim, Eunha",J Theor Biol,,557

At present there is limited clinical information of the SARS-CoV-2 and there is no specific treatment recommended, although technical guidances and suggestions have been developed and will continue to be updated as additional information becomes available. Preventive treatment has an important role to control and avoid the spread of severe respiratory disease, but often is difficult to obtain and sometimes cannot be effective to reduce the risk of deterioration of the underlining lung pathology. In order to define an effective and safe treatment for SARS-CoV-2-associated disease, we provide considerations on the actual treatments, on how to avoid complications and the undesirable side effects related to them and to select and apply earlier the most appropriate treatment. Approaching to treat severe respiratory disease in infants and children, the risks related to the development of atelectasis starting invasive or non-invasive ventilation support and the risk of oxygen toxicity must be taken into serious consideration. For an appropriate and effective approach to treat severe pediatric respiratory diseases, two main different strategies can be proposed according to the stage and severity of the patient conditions: patient in the initial phase and with non-severe lung pathology and patient with severe initial respiratory impairment and/or with delay in arrival to observation. The final outcome is strictly connected with the ability to apply an appropriate treatment early and to reduce all the complications that can arise during the intensive care admission.","Marraro, Giuseppe A; Spada, Claudio",Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,,557

319239,Evaluating a UVC System for Use During SARS-CoV2 Pandemic and Personal Protective Equipment Shortage,2020,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 increased stress levels while reducing access to mind-body services in patients with cancer. We describe the rapid deployment of remotely delivered mind-body services to people with cancer during COVID-19, rates of participation, and acceptability from patients' perspectives. METHODS: Eligible participants were patients with cancer age &#8805; 18 years enrolled in a single academic cancer center's online patient portal. Interventions included mind-body group therapy sessions in fitness, meditation, yoga, dance, tai chi, and music delivered using Zoom video conferencing. Sessions were 30-45 min and led by an integrative medicine clinician. Following each session, participants were asked to complete a three-item questionnaire assessing (1) satisfaction with the class session, (2) reduction in stress/anxiety, and (3) likelihood of recommending the class to others. Patients could also provide comments in real-time using the Zoom chat function. RESULTS: Among 5948 unique visits, the most frequently attended classes were fitness (n = 2513, 42.2%) followed by meditation (n = 1176, 19.8%) and yoga (n = 909, 15.3%). Of these visits, 3902 (65.6%) had an associated completed questionnaire. Across class types, a large majority of participants reported being extremely satisfied (n = 3733, 95.7%), experiencing extreme reductions in anxiety/stress (n = 3268, 83.8%), and being extremely likely to recommend the class to others (n = 3605, 92.4%). Fitness had the highest endorsement among class types (all p values < 0.001). Themes from the chat responses included gratitude, expressions of helpfulness, and feelings of connection. CONCLUSION: High utilization of and satisfaction with these virtual mind-body services demonstrate the significant potential of remote delivery to facilitate patient access to services.","Trevino, Kelly M; Raghunathan, Nirupa; Latte-Naor, Shelly; Polubriaginof, Fernanda C G; Jensen, Claus; Atkinson, Thomas M; Emard, Nicholas; Seluzicki, Christina M; Ostroff, Jamie S; Mao, Jun J",Support. care cancer,,557

To capture lockdown-related effects on a large scale, the present study used an online questionnaire completed by parents of 3-10-year-olds during the most restrictive lockdown period in Germany thus far (N = 2,672). Parents reported their stress level, their child's well-being, and their child's problem behaviors among others. Results showed that most parents and children experienced lockdown-related stress. Concerning children, not being able to meet with friends and family members outside the household emerged as the primary challenge. Older children (7-10 years) evidenced more emotional symptoms as well as less conduct problems and hyperactivity than younger children (3-6 years). Children's own and their parents' stress level, the degree to which children missed other children, and children's age all showed to be negatively related to children's general life satisfaction. Single parenthood and being an only child were associated with higher levels of child problems. Taken together, these findings shed light on the psychological well-being of children and their families during governmental lockdown measures, as well as on relations between children's coping and demographic background. They have implications for possible avenues for interventions, inter alia by encouraging policies that facilitate the maintenance of social relationships and focus particularly on children from single parent families, on only children as well as on families in challenging housing situations.","Christner, Natalie; Essler, Samuel; Hazzam, Astrid; Paulus, Markus",PLoS One,,557

METHODS: This retrospective single-institution analysis compared the clinical pathological characteristics of BC diagnosed between May 2020 and July 2020, after a 2-month screening interruption, with BC diagnosed in the same trimester of 2019 when mammographic screening was regularly carried out. RESULTS: The 2-month stop in mammographic screening produced a significant decrease in in situ BC diagnosis (-10.4%) and an increase in node-positive (+11.2%) and stage III BC (+10.3%). A major impact was on the subgroup of patients with BC at high proliferation rates. Among these, the rate of node-positive BC increased by 18.5% and stage III by 11.4%. In the subgroup of patients with low proliferation rates, a 9.3% increase in stage III tumors was observed, although node-positive tumors remained stable. Despite screening interruption, procedures to establish a definitive diagnosis and treatment start were subsequently carried out without delay. CONCLUSION: Our data showed an increase in node-positive and stage III BC after a 2-month stop in BC screening. These findings support recommendations for a quick restoration of BC screening at full capacity, with adequate prioritization strategies to mitigate harm and meet infection prevention requirements.","Toss, A; Isca, C; Venturelli, M; Nasso, C; Ficarra, G; Bellelli, V; Armocida, C; Barbieri, E; Cortesi, L; Moscetti, L; Piacentini, F; Omarini, C; Andreotti, A; Gambini, A; Battista, R; Dominici, M; Tazzioli, G",ESMO Open,,557

We aimed to collect information on psychologically distressing experiences of Italians living in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From 6 to 20 April 2020 participants filled out an online questionnaire. Demographic and physical symptoms data from the prior 14 days of quarantine were collected. Psychological impact of quarantine was assessed by the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). RESULTS: In all, 20,158 participants completed the online survey. Of these, 11,910 (59.1%) were from Lombardy, the region with 37.7% of positive cases identified during the survey period. 30.1% of responders were male. About half (55.9%) of responders were 18-50 years old, 54.3% had a tertiary level of education, 69.5% were workers, 84.1% were living in houses with &#8805;3 rooms, and 13.7% were living alone. 9.7% had had contact with COVID-19 positive people. Of all responders, 9978 (48.6%) reported a psychological impact, 8897 (43.4%) of whom reported mild or moderate and 1081 (5.2%) severe psychological impact. The multivariate analysis, after adjustments, showed that an increasing CPDI score was associated with gender (female), first-second educational level, being unemployed, living in a &#8804;2 room house, having had new health problems during the previous 14 days, and not having been out of the house in the previous week. Concerning the type of psychological distress, 2003 responders (9.9%) reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms, 1131 (5.5%) moderate to severe anxiety symptoms, and 802 (3.9%) moderate to severe physical symptoms. A positive correlation was found between responder rate (per 10.000 residents) and positive COVID-19 cases (per 10.000 residents) by region (rs = + 0.83, p = < 0.0001), and between responder rate and region latitude (rs = + 0.91, p = < 0.0001), with a greater response rate in the north. Considering Lombardy Region responders, a negative correlation between CPDI score and distance from place of residence to the red zone (Nembro-Alzano) was found. Higher prevalence of psychological distress was found up to 25 km away from the red zone and, in particular, severe distress up to 15 km. CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers and mental health professionals should be aware of quarantine's adverse mental health consequences. Factors influencing the success of quarantine and infection control practices for both disease containment and community recovery should be identified and additional support to vulnerable persons at increased risk of adverse psychological and social consequences of quarantine should be guaranteed.","Bonati, Maurizio; Campi, Rita; Zanetti, Michele; Cartabia, Massimo; Scarpellini, Francesca; Clavenna, Antonio; Segre, Giulia",BMC Psychiatry,,557

334680,Psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric healthcare workers,2021,"To investigate the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of the current COVID-19 outbreak, a total of 112 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains sampled from China and 12 other countries with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 9 February 2020 were analyzed. We performed phylogenetic, split network, likelihood-mapping, model comparison, and phylodynamic analyses of the genomes. Based on Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis with the best-fitting combination models, we estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 to be 12 November 2019 (95 % BCI: 11 October 2019 and 09 December 2019) and 9.90 × 10-4 substitutions per site per year (95 % BCI: 6.29 × 10-4-1.35 × 10-3), respectively. Notably, the very low Re estimates of SARS-CoV-2 during the recent sampling period may be the result of the successful control of the pandemic in China due to extreme societal lockdown efforts. Our results emphasize the importance of using phylodynamic analyses to provide insights into the roles of various interventions to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in China and beyond.","Nie, Qing; Li, Xingguang; Chen, Wei; Liu, Dehui; Chen, Yingying; Li, Haitao; Li, Dongying; Tian, Mengmeng; Tan, Wei; Zai, Junjie",Virus Res,,557

A total of 2562 full complete patients' questionnaires were considered for the study. Our results showed that awareness and information campaigns aimed at the general population are urgently needed in order to implement a correct use of masks and limit as much as possible the infection rate.","Scalvenzi, Massimiliano; Villani, Alessia; Ruggiero, Angelo",J. community health,,557
336644,The Pandemic of Hate is Giving COVID-19 a Helping Hand,2020,"Research on neurological disorders focuses primarily on the impact of neurons on disease mechanisms. Limited availability of animal models severely impacts the study of cell type specific contributions to disease. Moreover, animal models usually do not reflect variability in mutations and disease courses seen in human patients. Reprogramming methods for generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have revolutionized patient specific research and created valuable tools for studying disease mechanisms. However, iPSC technology has disadvantages such as time, labor commitment, clonal selectivity and loss of epigenetic markers. Recent modifications of these methods allow more direct generation of cell lineages or specific cell types, bypassing clonal isolation or a pluripotent stem cell state. We have developed a rapid direct conversion method to generate induced Neuronal Progenitor Cells (iNPCs) from skin fibroblasts utilizing retroviral vectors in combination with neuralizing media. The iNPCs can be differentiated into neurons (iNs) oligodendrocytes (iOs) and astrocytes (iAs). iAs production facilitates rapid drug and disease mechanism testing as differentiation from iNPCs only takes 5 days. Moreover, iAs are easy to work with and are generated in pure populations at large numbers. We developed a highly reproducible co-culture assay using mouse GFP+ neurons and patient derived iAs to evaluate potential therapeutic strategies for numerous neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Importantly, the iA assays are scalable to 384-well format facilitating the evaluation of multiple small molecules in one plate. This approach allows simultaneous therapeutic evaluation of multiple patient cell lines with diverse genetic background. Easy production and storage of iAs and capacity to screen multiple compounds in one assay renders this methodology adaptable for personalized medicine.","Dennys, Cassandra N; Sierra-Delgado, Julieth A; Ray, Shrestha Sinha; Hartlaub, Annalisa M; Roussel, Florence S; Rodriguez, Yacidzohara; Meyer, Kathrin",J. vis. exp,,557
336645,The Pandemic of Hate is Giving COVID-19 a Helping Hand,2020,"Even though the COVID-19 pandemic has endured to be a serious threat for the societies, the state authorities have been seeking policies to re-open the schools and universities It is clear that opening of the schools will cause more COVID-19 casualties, but the key question is how many students should attend the schools daily while keeping the casualties under control In this paper, an artificial intelligence based long-term policy making algorithm has been developed to generate time varying policies for opening of the schools part-by-part The key aim of the algorithm is to produce policies which maximize the number of the students attending the schools while minimizing the pandemic casualties under the worst-case uncertainties The proposed algorithm consists of a multi-input-multi-output, uncertain, and adaptive background parametric model which is externally manipulated by the produced adaptive policy Its long-term predictor assesses the possible future casualties under the current policy and its policy maker generates alternative solutions that minimize the future casualties The results confirm that the proposed algorithm is able to generate effective policies which minimize the COVID-19 casualties while maximize the number of the students attending the schools under the worst-case uncertainties","Tutsoy, O.",Ieee Access,,557
336851,COVID-19 Serosurveillance May Facilitate Return-to-Work Decisions,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Several long-lasting health complications have been reported in previous coronavirus infections. Therefore, the aim of this study was to review studies that evaluated physical and mental health problems post-COVID-19. METHODS: Articles for inclusion in this scoping review were identified by searching the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases for items dated from 1 January to 7 November 2020. Observational studies evaluating physical health (musculoskeletal symptoms, functional status) or mental health status with a follow-up period longer than 1 month after discharge or after the onset of symptoms were included. RESULTS: This scoping review included 34 studies with follow-up periods of up to 3 months post-COVID-19. The most commonly reported physical health problems were fatigue (range 28% to 87%), pain (myalgia 4.5% to 36%), arthralgia (6.0% to 27%), reduced physical capacity (six-minute walking test range 180 to 561 m), and declines in physical role functioning, usual care and daily activities (reduced in 15% to 54% of patients). Common mental health problems were anxiety (range 6.5% to 63%), depression (4% to 31%) and post-traumatic stress disorder (12.1% to 46.9%). Greater fatigue, pain, anxiety and depression were reported in female patients and individuals admitted to intensive care. An overall lower quality of life was seen up to 3 months post-COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the presence of several physical and mental health problems up to 3 months post-COVID-19. The findings point to the need for comprehensive evaluation and rehabilitation post-COVID-19 to promote quality of life.","Shanbehzadeh, Sanaz; Tavahomi, Mahnaz; Zanjari, Nasibeh; Ebrahimi-Takamjani, Ismail; Amiri-Arimi, Somayeh",J Psychosom Res,,557

337581,Embracing the Uncertainty: an Important Lesson from COVID-19,2021,"The numerous and varied roles of phosphorylated organic molecules in biochemistry suggest they may have been important to the origin of life. The prominence of phosphorylated molecules presents a conundrum given that phosphorylation is a thermodynamically unfavorable, endergonic process in water, and most natural sources of phosphate are poorly soluble. We recently demonstrated that a semi-aqueous solvent consisting of urea, ammonium formate, and water (UAFW) supports the dissolution of phosphate and the phosphorylation of nucleosides. However, the prebiotic feasibility and robustness of the UAFW system are unclear. Here, we study the UAFW system as a medium in which phosphate minerals are potentially solubilized. Specifically, we conduct a series of chemical experiments alongside thermodynamic models that simulate the formation of ammonium formate from the hydrolysis of hydrogen cyanide, and demonstrate the stability of formamide in such solvents (as an aqueous mixture). The dissolution of hydroxylapatite requires a liquid medium, and we investigate whether a UAFW system is solid or liquid over varied conditions, finding that this characteristic is controlled by the molar ratios of the three components. For liquid UAFW mixtures, we also find the solubility of phosphate is higher when the quantity of ammonium formate is greater than urea. We suggest the urea within the system can lower the activity of water, help create a stable and persistent solution, and may act as a condensing agent/catalyst to improve nucleoside phosphorylation yields.","Lago, Jennifer L; Burcar, Bradley T; Hud, Nicholas V; Febrian, Rio; Mehta, Christopher; Bracher, Paul J; Atlas, Zachary D; Pasek, Matthew A",Orig. life evol. biosph,,557

338296,TNM Classification: Are Cancers With Extrinsic Tongue Muscle Involvement Systematically T4a?,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic in more than 200 countries around the world. As the fourth most populous nation in the world, Indonesia is predicted to face a big threat to this pandemic particularly Jakarta as the epicentre of the virus in Indonesia. However, the nature of COVID-19 that can easily spread and also many undetected cases that do not present symptoms make it more difficult to determine the real mortality effects of COVID-19.The deaths in Jakarta from the new coronavirus may be higher than officially reported. To overcome this issue, this paper will provide an approach to measure the death impact of COVID-19 using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA). The model will predict the ?what if? normal condition of the number of funerals in Jakarta compared to the real situation in March 2020 as an approach of the actual effect of COVID-19 in Jakarta. This research revealed a discrepancy of 450-1070 funerals in March 2020 that could not be predicted by the ARIMA model. This funeral gap, a forecast error, could be an approach to the potential number of possible death impacts of COVID-19 in Jakarta that should be significantly higher than the report. The people should be more conscious and alert of COVID-19 situation.","Fadly, Ferdian; Sari, Erika",Unnes Journal Of Public Health,,557

Anecdotal evidence of the beneficial practices that facilitated safe veterinary treatment and equine care had been reported together with an increase in the use of electronic communication and information technologies during the first “lockdown”. Thus, the aim of this qualitative study was to capture any beneficial changes to racehorse veterinary care that were implemented during the first “lockdown” period in the UK that lasted from 23 March to 12 May 2020. Ten equine veterinary surgeons who primarily treat racehorses and 10 racehorse trainers were interviewed either by telephone or by videoconferencing. After using thematic analysis from a critical realist social constructionist perspective, four themes were identified. These were, firstly, according to our participants, the trainer–vet relationship is predicated upon a good working relationship, secondly, there had been little or no change in the vet–trainer relationship during the first “lockdown” period. Thirdly, when COVID-19 restrictions were in force, more remote consultations took place using images or videos as well as telephone consults, viewed favourably by both trainers and vets, and finally, intermittent connectivity and poor-quality images and videos limited their effectiveness. In order to fully benefit from the positive changes employed by some vets and trainers in their working relationships, we recommend that rural connectivity is prioritised.","Butler, Deborah Upton Lois Mullan Siobhan",Animals,,557

362805,Estimated glucose disposal rate demographics and clinical characteristics of young adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: A cross-sectional pilot study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Hundreds of variants associated with atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis, two common inflammatory skin disorders, have previously been discovered through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The majority of these variants are in non-coding regions and their target genes remain largely unclear. OBJECTIVE: We sought to understand the effects of these non-coding variants on the development of AD and psoriasis by linking them to the genes they regulate. METHODS: We constructed genomic 3D maps of human keratinocytes during differentiation using capture Hi-C targeting more >20, 000 promoters and 214 GWAS variants and combined this with transcriptome and epigenomic datasets. We validated our results with reporter assays, CRISPR activation and examination of patient gene expression from previous studies. RESULTS: We identified 118 target genes of 82 AD and psoriasis GWAS-variants. Differential expression of 49% (58) of the 118 target genes occurred in either AD or psoriatic lesions, many of which were not previously linked to any skin disease. We highlight AFG1L, CLINT1, ADO, LINC00302, and RP1-140J1.1 genes and provide further evidence for their potential roles in AD and psoriasis. CONCLUSIONS: Our work focuses on skin barrier pathology through investigation of the interaction profile of GWAS-variants during keratinocyte differentiation. We provide a catalogue of candidate genes that could modulate the risk of AD and psoriasis. Given that only 35% of the target genes are the nearest gene to the known GWAS variants, we expect that our work will contribute to the discovery of novel pathways involved in AD and psoriasis.","Sahlén, Pelin; Spalinskas, Rapolas; Asad, Samina; Mahapatra, Kunal Das; Höjer, Pontus; Anil, Anandashankar; Eisfeldt, Jesper; Srivastava, Ankit; Nikamo, Pernilla; Mukherjee, Anaya; Kim, Kyu-Han; Bergman, Otto; Ståhle, Mona; Sonkoly, Enikö; Pivarcsi, Andor; Wahlgren, Carl-Fredrik; Nordenskjöld, Magnus; Taylan, Fulya; Bradley, Maria; Tapia-Páez, Isabel",J. allergy clin. immunol,,557

364657,COVID-19 and Fake News in the Dominican Republic,2020,"BackgroundCamps of forcibly displaced populations are considered to be at risk of large COVID-19 outbreaks. Low screening rates and limited surveillance led us to conduct a study in Dagahaley camp, located in the Dadaab refugee complex in Kenya to estimate SARS-COV-2 seroprevalence and, mortality and to identify changes in access to care during the pandemic. MethodsTo estimate seroprevalence, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among a sample of individuals (n=587) seeking care at the two main health centres and among all household members (n=619) of community health workers and traditional birth attendants working in the camp. We used a rapid immunologic assay (BIOSYNEX(R) COVID-19 BSS [IgG/IgM]) and adjusted for test performance and mismatch between the sampled population and that of the general camp population. To estimate mortality, we exhaustively interviewed all households (n=12860) in the camp about deaths occurring from January 2019 through March 2021. ResultsWe included 1206 participants in the seroprevalence study. In total, 8% (95% CI: 6.6%-9.7%) had a positive serologic test. After adjusting for test performance and standardizing on age, we estimated a seroprevalence of 5.8% (95% CI: 1.6%-8.4%). The mortality rate for 10,000 persons per day was 0.05 (95% CI 0.05-0.06) prior to the pandemic and 0.07 (95% CI 0.06-0.08) during the pandemic, representing a significant 42% increase (p<0.001). MSF health centre consultations and hospital admissions decreased by 38% and 37% respectively. ConclusionWe estimated that the number of infected people was 67 times higher than the number of reported cases. Participants aged 50 years or more where among the most affected. The mortality survey shows an increase in the mortality rate during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic. A decline in attendance at health facilities was observed and sustained despite the easing of restrictions. Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSO_LIAt the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, models predicted the risk of a large-scale COVID-19 outbreaks in camps of forcibly displaced populations that would have created excess mortality caused directly by the disease and indirectly by reduced access to care and/or congestion in health facilities. C_LIO_LITo date, this prediction has not materialized in most camps, the lower than expected number of cases and deaths could be attributed to a population characteristics and early implementation of confinement; alternatively, it could be an underestimate caused by limited screening and testing capacity and lack of morbidity and mortality surveillance. C_LIO_LIThe actual impact of COVID-19 on these populations therefore remains an open question.

366216,Methodological Considerations for Modeling Social Vulnerability and COVID-19 Risk-Response to Nayak et al,2021,"Recent advancements in computational power and algorithms have enabled unabridged data (e.g., raw images or audio) to be used as input in some models (e.g., deep learning). However, the black box nature of such models reduces their likelihood of adoption by marketing scholars. Our paradigm of analysis, the Transparent Model of Unabridged Data (TMUD), enables researchers to investigate the inner workings of such black box models by incorporating an ex ante filtration module and an ex post experimentation module. We empirically demonstrate the TMUD by investigating the role of facial components and sexual dimorphism in face perceptions, which have implications for four marketing contexts: advertisement (perceptions of approachability, trustworthiness, and competence), brand (perceptions of whether a face represents a brand's typical customer), category (perceptions of whether a face represents a category's typical customer), and customer persona (perceptions of whether a face represents the persona of a brand's customer segment). Our results reveal new and useful findings that enrich the existing literature on face perception, most of which is based on abridged attributes (e.g., width of mouth). The TMUD has great potential to be a useful paradigm for generating theoretical insights and may encourage more marketing researchers and practitioners to use unabridged data.","Xu, Jie; Ding, Min",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07558v1.pdf,557

This national survey investigated the impact of the pandemic on burnout and career satisfaction among U.S. attending neurosurgeons. METHODS: A 24-question survey was sent electronically to all American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) attending members. The abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory (aMBI) was used to measure the following burnout and career satisfaction indices: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. Bivariate analyses were conducted and multivariate analyses were performed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: 407 attending neurosurgeons were included in the present study, with an overall response rate of 17.7 %. The majority of respondents were male (88.7 %), White (84.3 %), and in practice for 15 years or more (64.6 %). The majority reported a decrease in work hours due to the pandemic (82.6 %), uncertainty about future earnings (80.3 %), and uncertainty regarding future healthcare reform (84.5 %). Burnout was identified in 83 (20.4 %) respondents, whereas career satisfaction was identified in 316 (77.6 %) respondents. Rate of burnout was decreased when compared to rates reported in the pre-COVID era. In multivariate analysis, burnout was associated with working in a hostile or difficult environment since the rise of COVID-19 (OR = 2.534, p = 0.008), not having children (OR = 3.294, p = 0.011), being in practice for 5-15 years (vs. < 5 years) (OR = 4.568, p = 0.014), spending increased time conducting non-neurosurgical medical care due to COVID-19 (OR = 2.362, p = 0.019), feeling uncertain about future earnings due to COVID-19 (OR = 4.031, p = 0.035), and choosing not to pursue or feeling uncertain about pursuing neurosurgery again if given the choice (OR = 7.492, p < 0.001). Career satisfaction was associated with cerebrovascular subspecialty training (OR = 2.614, p = 0.046) and a willingness to pursue neurosurgery again if given the choice (OR = 2.962, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Factors related to the novel COVID-19 pandemic have contributed to changes in workflow among U.S. attending neurosurgeons. Despite these changes, we report decreased burnout and high career satisfaction among U.S. neurosurgeons. Understanding modifiable stressors among neurosurgeons during the pandemic may help to identify effective future interventions to mitigate burnout and improve career satisfaction.","Khalafallah, Adham M; Lam, Shravika; Gami, Abhishek; Dornbos, David L; Sivakumar, Walavan; Johnson, Jeremiah N; Mukherjee, Debraj",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,,557

371888,Responsibility of Medical Journals in Addressing Racism in Health Care,2020,"BACKGROUND: According to the recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), getting influenza vaccines during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemics is especially important for people with certain underlying medical conditions, like cancer. Due to the similarities between the symptoms of influenza and COVID-19, receiving the flu vaccine in suspicious cases can be helpful because it will make it easier to request a medical test and diagnosis. In this study, the value of influenza vaccination in the cancer population was investigated. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, all cancer patients who were referred to our clinic and had eligibility to receive the flu vaccine were included in our study for following up clinical signs every week for one month. All patients who were vaccinated from October 1 to November 15, 2020 were investigated. The most side effects that were followed were fever, runny nose, bone pain, and life-threatening or persistent adverse effects. RESULTS: From a total of 288 patients (median age: 52 years (range 18-79), 112 (38.9%) males and 176 (61.1%) female) with different types of cancers, only two patients had an adverse effect of vaccination (including bone pain, runny nose, and fatigue), and one had COVID-19 ten days after vaccination. The rest of the patients did not show any side effects due to flu vaccination after one month of follow-up. Cancer patients are recommended to receive the flu vaccine annually during the pandemic and after the end of this pandemic, usually during the flu epidemic season to reduce mortality.","Aznab, Mozaffar; Eskandari Roozbahani, Narges; Moazen, Homa",Support. care cancer,,557
374358,The decrease of non-complicated acute appendicitis and the negative appendectomy rate during pandemic,2021,"Research into COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes are critical, but claims must be carefully evaluated to inform policy decisions. In a recent series of articles, Manning and Fink [1-3] use national-level data to describe associations between case-fatality ratios and male and female finger ratios (2D:4D), a suggested measure of prenatal androgen exposure, as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) allele and genotype frequencies. The authors suggest that 2D:4D is linked with ACE variant prevalence, and that higher male 2D:4D is associated with higher case fatality ratios, and point to 2D:4D as a useful prognostic measure for COVID-19 susceptibility. A critical review and robust Bayesian analysis of the hypothesis is described here, finding no conclusive evidence of COVID-19 mortality and 2D:4D, nor associations between 2D:4D and ACE1 allele or ACE2 genotype frequency. This absence of evidence is present for data taken from the second wave of COVID-19 in October 2020. Problematic theoretical grounding, individual-level conclusions drawn from national-level data, and issues with statistical inference in the original articles are discussed. Taken together, the current data offer no clear utility of 2D:4D in determining COVID-19 outcomes.","Jones, Alex L; Jaeger, Bastian; Schild, Christoph",Early Hum Dev,,557
374388,Has the COVID-19 Pandemic Increased Mortality Among Patients with Cancer Receiving Systemic Anticancer Treatments?,2021,"Research problem: The use of virtual teams (VTs) has been growing steadily since the late 1990s. However, there is disagreement on how the virtuality of a team impacts the relationship of trust and team effectiveness. Some studies have suggested that the operationalization of the virtuality has been simplistic, with most researchers treating virtuality as a binary state. Recently, some researchers have sought to explore more complex conceptualizations of virtuality. Research question: How do dimensions of virtuality impact the relationship between intrateam trust and team effectiveness for virtual teams&#x003F;Literature review: Researchers have been studying the dynamics of VTs for more than 20 years;however, the prevailing measure of virtuality is unidimensional. Following others, we employ a multidimensional measure of virtuality to model three interactions with the relationship between intrateam trust and team effectiveness. By reviewing relevant team effectiveness, intrateam trust, and virtuality literature, we build a model of team effectiveness based on three dimensions of virtuality. Methodology: A total of 230 subjects on 73 project teams were asked to record their interactions while working on a complex case assignment, allowing us to measure the three dimensions of virtuality. Results: Findings indicate that although Distance Virtuality and Member Virtuality moderate the relationship between intrateam trust and effectiveness, Time Worked Virtually does not, supporting the proposition that virtuality is a multidimensional construct. Conclusion: Differential findings support the multidimensional conceptualization of virtuality. We discuss several implications of our findings for virtual team managers, while paying attention to recent changes in team composition resulting from shelter-in-place orders associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

375511,Paediatric treatment trials for COVID-19 are an ethical imperative,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a world disaster. COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus (DM) relationship is double-faced because DM is considered one of the COVID-19 key risk factors causing an increase in COVID-19 related conditions and death rates; at the same time, high stress in patients with COVID-19 can lead to the occurrence of DM. This relationship adversely affects immune functions. Relaxation techniques have been demonstrated to positively affect immune functions, glycemic control, and stress levels. METHODS: A search in Scopus, Web of Science, Medline databases, and EBSCO has been made. The search included clinical trials and systematic and literature reviews on the effects of relaxation techniques on immune functions, glycemic control, and stress levels. RESULTS: This review found that relaxation techniques produce short-term effects on decreasing stress levels through an autonomic regulation, controlling glycemic control through decreasing hyperglycemia, and increasing immune functions through increasing immune cells and immunoglobins A. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes the important role of performing regular relaxation techniques for COVID-19 patients with DM. Relaxation techniques benefit diabetic patients with COVID-19 through decreasing stress levels, better controlling of glycemic control, and increasing immune functions.","Mahmoud Mohamed, Ayman Abdalla; Alawna, Motaz",Curr. diabetes rev.

To evaluate the associated factors involved in these variants. Methods: between May/June of 2020, it was conducted a prospective cross-section study with symptomatic participants for COVID-19 (n=300). It was applied an online questionnaire and the DASS-21 to evaluate the mental health of participants. Results: it was observed that 28.6%, 29.7% and 27% of the participants showed severe/extreme levels symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression, respectively. The testing for COVID-19 application had constituted a protective factor for the development of psychiatric morbidity, once it had shown significant association in the low frequencies of severe/extreme depression [Odds Ratio (OR)]= 0.26; p=0.002) and stress (OR=0.39; p=0.01). Conclusion: individuals that are symptomatic for COVID-19 are a vulnerable group that may present high symptomatology for depression, anxiety, and stress. The identification of psychiatric morbidity frequency and its associated factors may contribute for the development of mental health strategies aiming at the prevention and mitigation of psychological impact in COVID-19 symptomatic population during the pandemic.","Santos, Alan Chaves dos; Tenorio, Paula Jaeger; Barbosa, Elias Almeida S.; Souza, Gustavo Fonseca de Albuquerque; Souza, Gabriela Albuquerque; Praciano, Gabriella de Almeida Figueredo; Maranhão, Laura Brito Barreto; Costa, Gabriela Oliveira Lobo Pereira da; Souza, Alex Sandro Rolland",Rev.

382784,Effect of an E-Learning Module on Personal Protective Equipment Proficiency Among Prehospital Personnel: Web-Based Randomized Controlled Trial,2020,"Batch homogeneity during lyophilization is crucial to ensure products with high quality. Known as edge-vial-effect, vials at the corners and edges tend to run warmer than center vials during primary drying. This is associated with risk of collapse or increased costs due to use of more conservative, longer drying conditions resulting in lower product temperature. The edge-vial-effect has been attributed to radiation coming from the chamber wall. We could show that the neighbor vial has a dominant impact on product temperature during lyophilization. Depending on the number of neighbors as well as the distance to a neighbor vial, the neighbor vial exerts a remarkable cooling effect. Energy transfer by gas conduction enables the cooling effect of a neighboring vial over a distance up to 10 mm. This not only leads to prolonged primary drying but also impacts cake appearance. Thus, to avoid trouble during lyophilization you have to watch out for the neighborhood.","Daller, Sarah; Schroeder, Rudolf; Friess, Wolfgang",J. pharm. sci,,557

PURPOSE: The study aimed to get to know opinions of pharmacy staff and owners on the functioning of the community pharmacy during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To collect opinions about functioning of the community pharmacy during the pandemic, we conducted cross-sectional study among pharmacy staff and owners of pharmacies. RESULTS: The study group included 456 respondents mostly associated with independent pharmacies (55.7%), from cities less than 100,000 inhabitants (38.8%). The number of patients as well as filled prescriptions increased during the pandemic. Respondents provided patients with advice on cold (81.6%), sore throat (77.0%) and acherelated complaints (68.6%). Most of participants (64.5%) declared that they informed patients about COVID-19. The safety measures in community pharmacies included: a safety regulations poster during the pandemic (97.1%), handwashing in accordance with recommended guidelines (96.3%) and using protective gloves by the pharmacy staff (89.9%). According to 60.7% of participants, the community pharmacy was properly prepared for the pandemic by the owner, however, respondents from independent pharmacies indicate this more frequently (p=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Respondents are aware of the role of community pharmacies in the healthcare system during the pandemic, nevertheless, more attention needs to be paid by public authorities and governmental institutions to patient safety in the community pharmacy.","Merks, Piotr; Swieczkowski, Damian; Bilmin, Krzysztof; Jakubowska, Marta; Drelich, Ewelina; Lewicki, Jedrzej; Golebiewska, Wioletta; Bogusz, Joanna; Jaguszewski, Milosz",Przegl Epidemiol,,557

384819,Redeployment of junior maxillofacial surgery staff during COVID-19-the Gloucester ITU experience,2020,"BACKGROUND: Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has enabled the rapid, unbiased detection and identification of microbes without pathogen-specific reagents, culturing, or a priori knowledge of the microbial landscape. mNGS data analysis requires a series of computationally intensive processing steps to accurately determine the microbial composition of a sample. Existing mNGS data analysis tools typically require bioinformatics expertise and access to local server-class hardware resources. For many research laboratories, this presents an obstacle, especially in resource-limited environments. FINDINGS: We present IDseq, an open source cloud-based metagenomics pipeline and service for global pathogen detection and monitoring (https://idseq.net). The IDseq Portal accepts raw mNGS data, performs host and quality filtration steps, then executes an assembly-based alignment pipeline, which results in the assignment of reads and contigs to taxonomic categories. The taxonomic relative abundances are reported and visualized in an easy-to-use web application to facilitate data interpretation and hypothesis generation. Furthermore, IDseq supports environmental background model generation and automatic internal spike-in control recognition, providing statistics that are critical for data interpretation. IDseq was designed with the specific intent of detecting novel pathogens. Here, we benchmark novel virus detection capability using both synthetically evolved viral sequences and real-world samples, including IDseq analysis of a nasopharyngeal swab sample acquired and processed locally in Cambodia from a tourist from Wuhan, China, infected with the recently emergent SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: The IDseq Portal reduces the barrier to entry for mNGS data analysis and enables bench scientists, clinicians, and bioinformaticians to gain insight from mNGS datasets for both known and novel pathogens.","Kalantar, Katrina L; Carvalho, Tiago; de Bourcy, Charles F A; Dimitrov, Boris; Dingle, Greg; Egger, Rebecca; Han, Julie; Holmes, Olivia B; Juan, Yun-Fang; King, Ryan; Kislyuk, Andrey; Lin, Michael F; Mariano, Maria; Morse, Todd; Reynoso, Lucia V; Cruz, David Rissato; Sheu, Jonathan; Tang, Jennifer; Wang, James; Zhang, Mark A; Zhong, Emily; Ahyong, Vida; Lay, Sreyngim; Chea, Sophana; Bohl, Jennifer A; Manning, Jessica E; Tato, Cristina M; DeRisi, Joseph L",Gigascience,,557

This unprecedented situation led to the inception of numerous fundamental research protocols and many clinical trials. It quickly became apparent that although COVID-19, in the vast majority of cases, was a benign disease, it could also develop a severe form with sometimes fatal outcomes. Cytokines are central to the pathophysiology of COVID-19; while some of them are beneficial (type-I interferon, interleukin-7), others appear detrimental (interleukin-1ß, -6, and TNF-&#945;) particularly in the context of the so-called cytokine storm. Yet another characteristic of the disease has emerged: concomitant immunodeficiency, notably involving impaired type-I interferon response, and lymphopenia. This review provides an overview of current knowledge on COVID-19 immunopathology. We discuss the defective type-I IFN response, the theoretical role of IL-7 to restore lymphocyte repertoire, as well as we mention the two patterns observed in severe COVID-19 (i.e. interleukin-1ß-driven macrophage activation syndrome vs. interleukin-6-driven immune dysregulation). Next, reviewing current evidence drawn from clinical trials, we examine a number of cytokine and anti-cytokine therapies, including interleukin-1, -6, and TNF inhibitors, as well as less targeted therapies, such as corticosteroids, chloroquine, or JAK inhibitors.","Jamilloux, Yvan; Henry, Thomas; Belot, Alexandre; Viel, Sébastien; Fauter, Maxime; El Jammal, Thomas; Walzer, Thierry; François, Bruno; Sève, Pascal",Autoimmun Rev,,557

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of foot reflexology applied before coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty on the anxiety, stress, and cortisol levels of individuals. METHODS: A simple randomized trial design was used. The patients who met the inclusion criteria were divided into 4 groups including experimental and control groups of coronary angiography patients (30 patients in each group) and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (26 patients in each group) by randomization method. Data were collected with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Distress Thermometer 90 minutes before coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and the laboratory samples were taken. After these procedures, foot reflexology was applied to both feet of the patients in the experimental group for 30 minutes, and the control group received only standard care. The inventories were reapplied 30 minutes after the reflexology application and after coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. RESULTS: Whereas there was no statistically significant difference (P > .05) between the coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty experimental and control groups in Anxiety Inventory and stress median scores before reflexology, a significant difference was found (P < .001) 30 minutes after reflexology application and after coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. After the reflexology, anxiety and stress scores were significantly lower in the experimental group compared with the control group (P < .001). Whereas there was a significant difference (P < .001) in the within-group cortisol values of both reflexology groups, no significant difference was found in the control groups (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: The application of reflexology before coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty reduces the levels of anxiety, stress, and cortisol without any side effects.","Vural Dogru, Birgül; SenuzunAykar, Fisun; Yildirim, Yasemin; Yavuzgil, Oguz; Sözmen, Eser; Memmedov, Hikmet",J. cardiovasc. nurs,,557

402081,Case report: Covid-19 and severe malaria Co-infection,2020,"Livestock wastewater (LW) typically contains a substantial amount of NH4+ that can potentially be recovered and used in fertilizers or chemicals. In an attempt to recover NH4+ from LW, a novel electrochemical approach using a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) was developed and its efficacy was demonstrated in this study. The GDE-based electrochemical device, when operated at an air-flow rate of 20 mL/min, was free of back-diffusion flux, which is a fatal drawback of any membrane-based NH4+ separation approach. Continuous operation resulted in a nitrogen flux of 890 g N/m2d with synthetic LW and 770 g N/m2d with real LW at a current density of 10 mA/cm2. The electrochemical energy input was 7.42 kWh/kg N with synthetic LW and 9.44 kWh/kg N with real LW. Compared with the traditional stripping method, the GDE-based electrochemical system has a certain potential to be competitive, in terms of energy consumption. For instance, a rough-cost estimate based only on operating costs regarding chemical usage, air blowing, and water pumping revealed that the system consumed 13.44 kWh/kg N, whereas the conventional stripper required 27.6 kWh/kg N. This analysis showed that an electrochemical approach such as our GDE-based method can recover NH3, (particularly in gaseous form) from LW. In addition, with the future development of a smart operation method, as proposed and demonstrated in this study, the cost-effective implementation of a GDE-based method is feasible.","Lee, Gwangtaek; Kim, DongYeon; Han, Jong-In",Water Res,,557

Restricting hospital access to authorized visitors was an important logistic challenge. To deal with this challenge, our institution developed the ExpectingU app to facilitate patient authorization for medical appointments and for visitors to enter the hospital. This article analyzes different trends regarding medical appointments, visitors' invitations, support staff hired and COVID hospitalizations to demonstrate how the ExpectingU system has helped the hospital to maintain accessibility to the hospital. Results shows that our system has allowed us to maintain the hospital open for medical appointments and visits without creating bottlenecks.","Ehrler, Frederic; Trompier, Remy; Merle, Guerric; Andre, Sebastien; Müller, Florian; Blondon, Katherine",Stud Health Technol Inform,,557

Here, common and rare variants from whole exome sequencing data of about 4,000 SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals were used to define an interpretable machine learning model for predicting COVID-19 severity. Firstly, variants were converted into separate sets of Boolean features, depending on the absence or the presence of variants in each gene. An ensemble of LASSO logistic regression models was used to identify the most informative Boolean features with respect to the genetic bases of severity. The Boolean features selected by these logistic models were combined into an Integrated PolyGenic Score that offers a synthetic and interpretable index for describing the contribution of host genetics in COVID-19 severity, as demonstrated through testing in several independent cohorts. Selected features belong to ultra-rare, rare, low-frequency, and common variants, including those in linkage disequilibrium with known GWAS loci. Noteworthly, around one quarter of the selected genes are sex-specific. Pathway analysis of the selected genes associated with COVID-19 severity reflected the multi-organ nature of the disease. The proposed model might provide useful information for developing diagnostics and therapeutics, while also being able to guide bedside disease management.","Fallerini, Chiara; Picchiotti, Nicola; Baldassarri, Margherita; Zguro, Kristina; Daga, Sergio; Fava, Francesca; Benetti, Elisa; Amitrano, Sara; Bruttini, Mirella; Palmieri, Maria; Croci, Susanna; Lista, Mirjam; Beligni, Giada; Valentino, Floriana; Meloni, Ilaria; Tanfoni, Marco; Colombo, Francesca; Cabri, Enrico; Fratelli, Maddalena; Gabbi, Chiara; Mantovani, Stefania; Frullanti, Elisa; Gori, Marco; Crawley, Francis P; Butler-Laporte, Guillaume; Richards, Brent; Zeberg, Hugo; Lipcsey, Miklos; Hultstrom, Michael; Ludwig, Kerstin U; Schulte, Eva C.; Pairo-Castineira, Erola; Baillie, John Kenneth; Schmidt, Axel; Frithiof, Robert; HGI, - WESWGS working group within the; Consortium, - GenOMICC; Study, - GEN-COVID Multicenter; Mari, Francesca; Renieri, Alessandra; Furini, Simone",,,557

Data were collected by an anonymous online questionnaire on food intake among 820 adolescents from Spain, Italy, Brazil, Colombia, and Chile. The results show that COVID-19 confinement did influence their dietary habits. In particular, we recorded modified consumption of fried food, sweet food, legumes, vegetables, and fruits. Moreover, gender, family members at home, watching TV during mealtime, country of residence, and maternal education were diversely correlated with adequate nutrition during COVID-19 confinement.

Conestat alfa (8400 U followed by 4200 U every 8 hours) will be administered as a slow intravenous injection (5-10 minutes) over a 72-hour period (i.e. 9 administrations in total). The first conestat alfa treatment will be administered on the day of enrolment. The control group will receive SOC only. SOC treatment will be administered according to local institutional guidelines, including supplemental oxygen, antibiotics, corticosteroids, remdesivir, and anticoagulation. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint of this trial is disease severity on day 7 after enrolment assessed by an adapted WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (score 0 will be omitted and score 6 and 7 will be combined) from 1 (no limitation of activities) to 7 (death). Secondary outcomes include (i) the time to clinical improvement (time from randomization to an improvement of two points on the WHO ordinal scale or discharge from hospital) within 14 days after enrolment, (ii) the proportion of participants alive and not having required invasive or non-invasive ventilation at 14 days after enrolment and (iii) the proportion of subjects without an acute lung injury (defined by PaO2/FiO2 ratio of &#8804;300mmHg) within 14 days after enrolment. Exploratory outcomes include virological clearance, C1 esterase inhibitor pharmacokinetics and changes in routine laboratory parameters and inflammatory proteins. RANDOMISATION: Subjects will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with conestat alfa in addition to SOC or SOC only. Randomization is performed via an interactive web response system (SecuTrial®). BLINDING (MASKING): In this open-label trial, participants, caregivers and outcome assessors are not blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): We will randomise approximately 120 individuals (80 in the active treatment arm, 40 in the SOC group). Two interim analyses after 40 and 80 patients are planned according to the Pocock adjusted levels &#945;p = 0.0221. The results of the interim analysis will allow adjustment of the sample size (Lehmacher, Wassmer, 1999). TRIAL STATUS: PROTECT-COVID-19 protocol version 3.0 (July 07 2020). Participant recruitment started on July 30 2020 in one center (Basel, Switzerland, first participant included on August 06 2020). In four of five study centers patients are actively recruited.

METHOD: A literature review regarding the shortage of physicians with data compilation from Delaware Department of Public Health (DPH) and Delaware Health and Social services (DHSS) was performed. A review of the ""Conrad 30 J1 VISA waiver program,"" the most important and primary supplier of physicians to underserved areas of the state was performed. A survey interviewing the physicians recruited through this program to identify any challenges faced by them was designed and conducted. RESULTS: The number of primary care physicians providing direct patient care in Delaware in 2018 had declined about 6% from 2013. The average wait time to see a PCP was 8.2 days in 1998 as compared to 23.5 days in 2018. Forty-six percent of physicians serving in HPSAs in Delaware are IMGs recruited through the J1 VISA waiver program. Eighty percent of these IMGs are actively considering leaving the United States due to anxieties around physician immigration policies, mainly ""Immigration backlog."" CONCLUSION: The existing programs to recruit physicians to underserved areas seem to be inadequate. The state and the hospital systems should be able to utilize the J1 program to its full potential and focus on retaining these physicians after their assigned services. As the challenges of IMGs continue to worsen every day; the medical societies, hospitals, the state and federal government should advocate for policies that resolve these challenges.","Malayala, Srikrishna Varun; Vasireddy, Deepa; Atluri, Paavani; Alur, Ram Sanjeev",J Prim Care Community Health,,557

435355,102 The impact of COVID-19 on the GOSH newborn screening service,2020,"Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years. Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold. The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV. HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well. Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic. The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known. Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases. Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans. In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission. Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination. The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context. In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.","Ye, Zi-Wei; Yuan, Shuofeng; Yuen, Kit-San; Fung, Sin-Yee; Chan, Chi-Ping; Jin, Dong-Yan",Int J Biol Sci,,557

Only about 10 cases have been reported in the English-language literature to date. In this report, we present a rare case of a giant EIC with infection arising within the deep breast parenchyma. Unlike a typical EIC of the breast, the EIC in the present case was a cystic and solid lesion containing a large amount of liquid within the cyst and popcorn-like calcification in the wall. In this report, we describe the contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM), ultrasonography, and computed tomography findings and provide a reference for the diagnosis of EICs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the CESM findings of an EIC. Our case illustrates that CESM has excellent performance similar to that of magnetic resonance imaging and is much more effective than conventional digital mammography. Additionally, our case indicates that precise correlation of CESM with ultrasonography findings contributes to the diagnosis of EICs. This rare case with multiple imaging findings will increase the awareness of EICs in the breast parenchyma.","Zhang, Yongxia; Song, Lei; Zhang, Han; Liu, Fengjie; Hao, Guo; Liu, Jing; Xie, Haizhu; Shi, Hao",J Int Med Res,,557

We conducted a retrospective review of hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen who received these drugs. OBJECTIVES: To examine the potential efficacy and safety of theophylline and pentoxifylline in COVID-19 pneumonia patients. METHODS: Adults with a positive test for SARS-COV2 and were hospitalized due to pneumonia requiring either high flow nasal cannula or mechanical ventilation were included. Patients with a history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were preferentially given theophylline. All other patients received pentoxifylline 400 mg orally TID. A group of hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving standard of care acted as a comparison group. The coprimary outcomes were a change in C-reactive protein (CRP) and ROX score between groups from day 1 to day 4 of therapy. RESULTS: Two hundred and nine inpatients were reviewed. Fifty-eight patients received pentoxifylline/theophylline, with 151 patients serving as the comparison group. Active therapy was associated with an increase in the ROX score (mean: 2.9 (95% CI: 0.6, 5.1)) and decrease in CRP (mean: -0.7 (95% CI: -4.7, 3.2). Mortality rates were theophylline/pentoxifylline 24% and comparison group had a 26%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study, theophylline and pentoxifylline were associated with an increase in ROX score and nominal decreases in CRP and mortality. Treatment was safe with few adverse reactions documented. We believe that this study could the basis for randomized-controlled trials to further explore these drugs' role in COVID-19.","Wall, Geoffrey C; Smith, Hayden L; Trump, Matthew W; Mohr, Jason D; DuMontier, Samuel P; Sabates, Becca L; Ganapathiraju, Iaswarya; Kable, Tim J",Clin Respir J,,557

We conducted n=26 semi-structured interviews with PM users, built-in browser/operating system PM users, and non-PM users. The average participant age was 70.4 years. Using the same codebook from Pearman et al., we showcase differences and similarities in PM adoption between the samples, including fears of a single point of failure and the importance of having control over one's private information. Meanwhile, older adults were found to have higher mistrust of cloud storage of passwords and cross-device synchronization. We also highlight PM adoption motivators for older adults, including the power of recommendations from family members and the importance of education and outreach to improve familiarity.","Ray, Hirak; Wolf, Flynn; Kuber, Ravi; Aviv, Adam J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01973v1.pdf,557

A multicentre retrospective cohort study""",2020,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic of global impact that forced social-political measures to be taken, such as the declaration of the state of alarm in Spain. At the same time, the reorganization of the pediatric medical-surgical activities and infrastructures was carried out, with the consequent suspension of the non-urgent surgical activity of Pediatric Urology. We analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical activity in a Pediatric Urology division, as well as surgical complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of epidemiological, clinical and surgical data was carried out, including complications and readmissions of all patients operated on in the division of Pediatric Urology within the duration of the state of alarm. Five time periods have been created according to the de-escalation phases. RESULTS: Forty-nine surgical procedures were carried out on 45 patients (8 prior to the implementation of the de-escalation phases). High priority pathologies were the most frequent in the first phases, being the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction the most prevalent. Four complications were recorded (8.8%), none of them were respiratory. CONCLUSIONS: The EAU recommendations for the resumption of surgical activity have allowed a correct, safe and gradual transition to the routine surgical activity in Pediatric Urology. The Clavien-Dindo classification is useful and valid for application in this division. No respiratory complications have been reported that could be attributable to the pandemic situation.","Merino-Mateo, L; Tordable Ojeda, C; Cabezalí Barbancho, D; Gómez Fraile, A",Actas Urol Esp,,557

Using this new algorithm we report a comprehensive database of the normal mode frequencies of all known protein structures, which has not been available before. We then use the resulting frequency spectra of the proteins to generate audible sound by overlaying the molecular vibrations and translating them to the audible frequency range using the music theoretic concept of transpositional equivalence. The method, implemented as a Max audio device for use in a digital audio workstation (DAW), provides unparalleled insights into the rich vibrational signatures of protein structures, and offers a new way for creative expression by using it as a new type of musical instrument. This musical instrument is fully defined by the vibrational feature of almost all known protein structures, making it fundamentally different from all the traditional instruments that are limited by the material properties of a few types of conventional engineering materials, such as wood, metals or polymers.","Qin, Zhao; Buehler, Markus J",,,557

A better understanding of the decisions made by the occupants during an emergency can help to develop calculation tools that can create more efficient forms of visual and audio communication and implement better procedures for evacuating people. The difficulty in studying human behavior lies in the very nature of emergencies, as they are unpredictable, somewhat exceptional and not reproducible. Fire drills play a role in training emergency teams and building occupants, but they cannot be used to collect real data on people's behavior unless the drill is so realistic that it could endanger the occupants' safety. In the procedure described here, through the use of a Virtual Reality device that encompasses all critical phases, including user characterization data before the virtual experience, building design parameters and fire scenario, key variables of human behavior can be recorded in order to evaluate each user's experience satisfactorily. This research shows that the average delay in starting an evacuation is greater than one minute, that anxiety levels and heart rates increase during a fire and that people do not pay attention to evacuation signals. Further analysis of the quantitative data may also provide the causes for decision-making. The use of devices that create realistic virtual environments is a solution for conducting ""what if"" tests to study and record the decisions taken by the users who undergo the experience in a way that is completely safe for them.","de Lama, Carlos; González-Gaya, Cristina; Sánchez-Lite, Alberto",,,557

As SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, we developed a lung organoid model using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-LOs). The hPSC-LOs, particularly alveolar type-II-like cells, are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and showed robust induction of chemokines following SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar to what is seen in patients with COVID-19. Nearly 25% of these patients also have gastrointestinal manifestations, which are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes1. We therefore also generated complementary hPSC-derived colonic organoids (hPSC-COs) to explore the response of colonic cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that multiple colonic cell types, especially enterocytes, express ACE2 and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using hPSC-LOs, we performed a high-throughput screen of FDA-approved drugs and identified entry inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, including imatinib, mycophenolic acid and quinacrine dihydrochloride. Treatment at physiologically relevant levels of these drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of both hPSC-LOs and hPSC-COs. Together, these data demonstrate that hPSC-LOs and hPSC-COs infected by SARS-CoV-2 can serve as disease models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a valuable resource for drug screening to identify candidate COVID-19 therapeutics.","Han, Yuling; Duan, Xiaohua; Yang, Liuliu; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E; Wang, Pengfei; Duan, Fuyu; Tang, Xuming; Yaron, Tomer M; Zhang, Tuo; Uhl, Skyler; Bram, Yaron; Richardson, Chanel; Zhu, Jiajun; Zhao, Zeping; Redmond, David; Houghton, Sean; Nguyen, Duc-Huy T; Xu, Dong; Wang, Xing; Jessurun, Jose; Borczuk, Alain; Huang, Yaoxing; Johnson, Jared L; Liu, Yuru; Xiang, Jenny; Wang, Hui; Cantley, Lewis C; tenOever, Benjamin R; Ho, David D; Pan, Fong Cheng; Evans, Todd; Chen, Huanhuan Joyce; Schwartz, Robert E; Chen, Shuibing",Nature (Lond.),,557

The study aims to evaluate the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus in tears and conjunctival secretion of patients with COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: A prospective interventional case series study was performed, and 32 patients with COVID-19 were selected at the Pamukkale University Hospital from 15 to 22 May 2020. The tear and conjunctival samples were collected by a conjunctival swab. Each specimen was sent to the laboratory for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses. To avoid cross-infection, gloves and personal protective equipment were changed after collecting each sample. RESULTS: 32 patients (18 male, 14 female) with Covid-19 were included in this cross-sectional study. The average age of the patients was 52.81 ± 16.76 years. By the time of the first collection of conjunctival-tear samples, the mean time of the onset of complaints was 6.84 ± 6.81 (1-35) days. Tear-conjunctival samples from 5 patients (16%) without conjunctivitis yielded positive PCR results, 3 of whom had positive and 2 negative nasopharyngeal PCR results.

452936,Longitudinal increases in childhood depression symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown,2020,"In the UK, one in two people will develop cancer during their lifetimes and radiotherapy (RT) plays a key role in effective treatment. High energy proton beam therapy commenced in the UK National Health Service in 2018. Heavier charged particles have potential advantages over protons by delivering more dose in the Bragg peak, with a sharper penumbra, lower oxygen dependence and increased biological effectiveness. However, they also require more costly equipment including larger gantries to deliver the treatment. There are significant uncertainties in the modelling of relative biological effectiveness and the effects of the fragmentation tail which can deliver dose beyond the Bragg peak. These effects need to be carefully considered especially in relation to long-term outcomes.In 2019, a group of clinicians, clinical scientists, engineers, physical and life scientists from academia and industry, together with funding agency stakeholders, met to consider how the UK should address new technologies for RT, especially the use of heavier charged particles such as helium and carbon and new modes of delivery such as FLASH and spatially fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT).There was unanimous agreement that the UK should develop a facility for heavier charged particle therapy, perhaps constituting a new National Ion Research Centre to enable research using protons and heavier charged particles. Discussion followed on the scale and features, including which ions should be included, from protons through helium, boron, and lithium to carbon, and even oxygen. The consensus view was that any facility intended to treat patients must be located in a hospital setting while providing dedicated research space for physics, preclinical biology and clinical research with beam lines designed for both in vitro and in vivo research. The facility should to be able to investigate and deliver both ultra-high dose rate FLASH RT and SFRT (GRID, minibeams etc.). Discussion included a number of accelerator design options and whether gantries were required. Other potential collaborations might be exploited, including with space agencies, electronics and global communications industries and the nuclear industry.In preparation for clinical delivery, there may be opportunities to send patients overseas (for 12C or 4He ion therapy) using the model of the National Health Service (NHS) Proton Overseas Programme and to look at potential national clinical trials which include heavier ions, FLASH or SFRT. This could be accomplished under the auspices of NCRI CTRad (National Cancer Research Institute, Clinical and Translational Radiotherapy Research Working Group).The initiative should be a community approach, involving all interested parties with a vision that combines discovery science, a translational research capability and a clinical treatment facility. Barriers to the project and ways to overcome them were discussed. Finally, a set of different scenarios of features with different costs and timelines was constructed, with consideration given to the funding environment (prer-Covid-19) and need for cross-funder collaboration.","Kirkby, Karen Joy; Kirkby, Norman Francis; Burnet, Neil Gunn; Owen, Hywel; Mackay, Ranald Iain; Crellin, Adrian; Green, Stuart",Br J Radiol,,557

457036,COVID-19 and beliefs about tobacco use: an online cross-sectional study in Iran,2020,"BACKGROUND: All anesthetists are at risk of mental ill health and pediatric anesthetists face additional stressors that may impact upon well-being, particularly after an adverse outcome. The SARS COV-2 pandemic has resulted in a plethora of resources to support the well-being of frontline workers. Developing a well-being system for an anesthesia department using these resources may be complex to implement. AIMS: In this article we outline how an anesthesia department can design and implement a framework for wellbeing, regardless of resources and financial constraints. We use the example of a free online toolkit developed in Australia for anesthetists. METHODS: The ""Long lives, Healthy Workplaces toolkit"" is a framework which has been specifically developed by mental health experts for anesthetists, and does not require departments to pay for external experts.1 Departments can design a long-term model of evidence-based mental health strategies to meet their unique needs using five steps outlined in the toolkit and detailed in this article. The framework uses cycles of assessment and review to create an adaptable approach to incorporate emerging evidence. We explain how culture can impact the implementation of a well-being framework and we outline how departments can set goals and priorities. CONCLUSION: Departments have different constraints which will alter how they approach supporting anaesthetists' wellbeing. Regardless of location or funding all departments should explicitly address anesthetists well-being. Long term sustainable well-being programs require a strategic and coordinated approach.","Shrivastava, Prani P; McDonald, Jane M",Paediatr. anaesth,,557
458313,Stigma and discrimination among doctors toward health-care staff working at COVID-19 sites,2020,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) appeared in December 2019 and then spread throughout the world rapidly. The virus invades the target cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 and modulates the expression of ACE2 in host cells. ACE2, a pivotal component of the renin-angiotensin system, exerts its physiological functions by modulating the levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang-(1-7). We reviewed the literature that reported the distribution and function of ACE2 in the female reproductive system, hoping to clarify the potential harm of 2019-nCoV to female fertility. The available evidence suggests that ACE2 is widely expressed in the ovary, uterus, vagina and placenta. Therefore, we believe that apart from droplets and contact transmission, the possibility of mother-to-child and sexual transmission also exists. Ang II, ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) regulate follicle development and ovulation, modulate luteal angiogenesis and degeneration, and also influence the regular changes in endometrial tissue and embryo development. Taking these functions into account, 2019-nCoV may disturb the female reproductive functions through regulating ACE2.","Jing, Yan; Run-Qian, Li; Hao-Ran, Wang; Hao-Ran, Chen; Ya-Bin, Liu; Yang, Gao; Fei, Chen",Mol Hum Reprod,,557

Recent findings suggest that LUS diagnosis is highly advantageous because of its mobility and correlation with radiological findings for viral pneumonia. Simple models for both educational evaluation and technical evaluation are needed. Therefore, this work investigates the usability of a large animal model under aspects of LUS features of viral pneumonia using saline one lung flooding. Six pigs were intubated with a double-lumen tube, and the left lung was instilled with saline. During the instillation of up to 12.5 ml/kg, the sonographic features were assessed. All features present during viral pneumonia were found, such as B-lines, white lung syndrome, pleural thickening, and the formation of pleural consolidations. Sonographic findings correlate well with current LUS scores for COVID19. The scores of 1, 2, and 3 were dominantly present at 1-4-, 4-8-, and 8-12-ml/kg saline instillation, respectively. The noninfective animal model can be used for further investigation of the LUS features and can serve in education, by helping with the appropriate handling of LUS in clinical practice during management of viral pneumonia.","Wolfram, Frank; Braun, Conny; Gutsche, Holger; Lesser, Thomas Guenther",IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control,,557
464840,A Roadmap for Diversity in Medicine During the Age of COVID-19 and George Floyd,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, more than ever, optimal influenza vaccination coverage among healthcare workers (HCWs) is crucial to avoid absenteeism and disruption of health services, as well as in-hospital influenza outbreaks. The aim of this study is to analyze the 2020 influenza vaccination campaign, comparing it with the previous year's in a research and teaching hospital in Northern Italy. METHODS: adopting an approach based on combined strategies, three interventions were deployed: a promotional and educational campaign, vaccination delivery through both ad hoc and on-site ambulatories, and a gaming strategy. Personal data and professional categories were collected and analyzed using univariate logistic regression. Vaccinated HCWs were asked to fill in a questionnaire to describe their reasons for vaccination adherence. RESULTS: the vaccination coverage rate (VCR) was 43.1%, compared to 21.5% in 2019. The highest increase was registered among administrative staff (308.3%), while physicians represent the most vaccinated category (n = 600). Moreover, residents (prevalence ratio (PR): 1.12; 95% CI 1.04-1.20), as well as intensive care (PR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.24-1.69) and newborn workers (PR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.20-1.65) were, respectively, the categories most frequently vaccinated for the first time. CONCLUSION: the significant increase in vaccination coverage rate confirms the suitability of the combined strategy of delivering the flu vaccination campaign and represents a first step towards reaching WHO recommended vaccination rates.","Perrone, Pier Mario; Biganzoli, Giacomo; Lecce, Maurizio; Campagnoli, Emanuela Maria; Castrofino, Ambra; Cinnirella, Andrea; Fornaro, Federica; Gallana, Claudia; Grosso, Francesca Maria; Maffeo, Manuel; Shishmintseva, Viktoriia; Pariani, Elena; Castaldi, Silvana",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,557

471099,"Palliative Care Consultation in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19: A Retrospective Study of Characteristics, Outcomes, and Unmet Needs",2021,"Androgens play a fundamental role in the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, inducing both the ACE-2 receptor to which SARS-CoV-2 binds to gain entry into the cell, and TMPRS22, the transmembrane protease that primes the viral spike protein for efficient infection. The United States stands alone among developed nations in permitting one androgen, oral dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), to be freely available OTC and online as a ""dietary supplement."" DHEA is widely used by males in the US to offset the age-related decline in circulating androgens. This fact may contribute to the disparate statistics of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in this country. In regulatory antithesis, every other developed nation regulates DHEA as a controlled substance. DHEA is an extremely potent inhibitor of Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD), with uniquely unstable uncompetitive inhibition kinetics. This has particular relevance to COVID-19, because G6PD-deficient human cells have been demonstrated to be exceptionally sensitive to infection by human coronavirus. Because DHEA is lipophilic and freely passes into cells, oral DHEA bypasses the normal controls regulating androgen biology and uncompetitive G6PD inhibition. DHEA's status as a ""dietary supplement"" means that no clinical trials demonstrating safety have been performed, and, in the absence of physician supervision, no data on adverse events has been collected. During the current pandemic, the unrestricted availability of oral DHEA as a ""dietary supplement"" cannot be considered safe without proof from placebo-controlled clinical trials that it is not contributing to the severity of COVID-19. US physicians may therefore wish to query their patients' use of DHEA.","Nyce, Jonathan Wesley",Endocr. relat. cancer,,557

The proposed method has been used for the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) using chest X-ray image (CXI) and chest computer tomography image (CCTI). The FBSED method is used to decompose CXI and CCTI into sub-band images (SBIs). The SBIs are then used to train various pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models separately using a transfer learning approach. The combination of SBI and CNN is termed as one channel. Deep features from each channel are fused to get a feature vector. Different classifiers are used to classify pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other viral and bacterial pneumonia and healthy subjects with the extracted feature vector. The different combinations of channels have also been analyzed to make the process computationally efficient. For CXI and CCTI databases, the best performance has been obtained with only one and four channels, respectively. The proposed model was evaluated using 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation processes. The average accuracy for the CXI database was 100% for both 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation processes, and for the CCTI database, it is 97.6% for the 5-fold cross-validation process. Therefore, the proposed method may be used by radiologists to rapidly diagnose patients with COVID-19.","Chaudhary, Pradeep Kumar; Pachori, Ram Bilas",Comput Biol Med,,557

Evidence from previous pandemics suggest that bariatric patients may experience increased emotional distress and difficulty adhering to healthy lifestyle changes post-surgery. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the impact of the novel COVID-19 public health crisis on bariatric patients' self-management post-surgery. METHOD: In a nested-qualitative study, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 23 post-operative bariatric patients who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) at a Canadian Bariatric Surgery Program between 2014 and 2020. A constant comparative approach was used to systematically analyze the data and identify the overarching themes. RESULTS: Participants (n = 23) had a mean age of (48.82 ± 10.03) years and most were female (n = 19). The median time post-surgery was 2 years (range: 6 months-7 years). Themes describing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients' post-bariatric surgery self-management included: coping with COVID-19; vulnerability factors and physical isolation; resiliency factors during pandemic; and valuing access to support by virtual care. The need for patients to access post-operative bariatric care during COVID-19 differed based on gender and socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted patients' ability to self-manage obesity and their mental health in a variety of ways. These findings suggest that patients may experience unique psychological distress and challenges requiring personalized care strategies to improve obesity self-care and overall well-being.","Youssef, Alaa; Cassin, Stephanie E; Wnuk, Susan; Leung, Samantha; Jackson, Timothy; Sockalingam, Sanjeev",Appetite,,557

477719,11 Towards international federated health data analysis: experience with the 4CE consortium for characterisation of Covid-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation may be used as a potential bridge to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), or as a ceiling-of-care for persistent hypoxaemia despite standard oxygen therapy, according to UK guidelines. We examined the association of mode of respiratory support and ceiling-of-care on mortality. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of routinely collected de-identified data of adults with nasal/throat SARs-CoV-2 swab-positive results, at the Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust between 10th March-19th April 2020 (outcomes determined on 22nd May). FINDINGS: Of 347 patients with SARs-CoV-2 swab-positive results, 294 (84.7%) patients admitted for Covid-19 were included in the study. Sixty-nine patients were trialled on CPAP, mostly delivered by face mask, either as an early ceiling of care instituted within 24 hours of admission (N = 19), or as a potential bridge to IMV (N = 44). Patients receiving a ceiling of care more than 24 hours after admission (N = 6) were excluded from the analysis. Two hundred and fifteen patients (73.1%) maximally received air/standard oxygen therapy, and 45 (15.3%) patients maximally received CPAP. Thirty-four patients (11.6%) required IMV, of which 24 had received prior CPAP. There were 138 patients with an early ceiling-of-care plan (pre-admission/within 24h). Overall, 103(35.0%) patients died and 191(65.0%) were alive at study end. Among all patients trialled on CPAP either as a potential bridge to IMV (N = 44) or as a ceiling-of-care (N = 19) mortality was 25% and 84%, respectively. Overall, there was strong evidence for higher mortality among patients who required CPAP or IMV, compared to those who required only air/oxygen (aOR 5.24 95%CI: 1.38, 19.81 and aOR 46.47 95%CI: 7.52, 287.08, respectively; p<0.001), and among patients with early ceiling-of-care compared to those without a ceiling (aOR 41.81 95%CI: 8.28, 211.17; p<0.001). Among patients without a ceiling of care (N = 137), 10 patients required prompt intubation following failed oxygen therapy, but 44 patients received CPAP. CPAP failure, defined as death (N = 1) or intubation (N = 24), occurred in 57% (N = 25) of patients. But in total, 75% (N = 33) of those started on CPAP with no ceiling of care recovered to discharge-19 without the need for IMV, and 14 following IMV. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that among patients with no ceiling-of-care, an initial trial of CPAP as a potential bridge to IMV offers a favourable therapeutic alternative to early intubation. In contrast, among patients with a ceiling-of care, CPAP seems to offer little additional survival benefit beyond oxygen therapy alone. Information on ceilings of respiratory support is vital to interpreting mortality from Covid-19. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY: Sample size relatively small.Study sample representative of hospitalised Covid-19 patients in UK.Previously unreported data on role of ceilings-of-care in hospitalised Covid-19 patients.Novel data on use of CPAP separated by indication.","Walker, Jonathan; Dolly, Shaman; Ng, Liji; Prior-Ong, Melissa; Sabapathy, Kalpana",PLoS One,,557

A review on the environmental and climatic characteristics related to historical infectious diseases will shed immediate light on the scientific research and control of COVID-19. Our results show that:(1) Historically, outbreaks of human-to-human coronavirus and orthomyxoviridae infectious diseases mainly occurred in the subtropical monsoon climate of the northern hemisphere in the winter and spring, while the outbreaks of flaviridae infectious diseases mostly occurred in tropical regions in hot and rainy summer and autumn.(2) Global warming and extreme weather may exacerbate the outbreak and spread of infectious diseases.(3) The impact of human activities on the ecosystem balance forces the habitat migration of virus hosts and the aggregation of different virus hosts, increasing the probability of virus mutation and the risk of infectious disease outbreaks. The lessons from historical outbreak of infectious diseases suggest that suitable climate factors might be conducive to the outbreak and epidemics, while the outbreaks in tropical countries also indicate that it is necessary to scrutinize the roles of climate, environmental conditions and ecological factors in the global wave of COVID-19.

480212,Tumor Boards during COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"COVID-19 has affected every sector of our society, among which human mobility is taking a dramatic change due to quarantine and social distancing. We investigate the impact of the pandemic and subsequent mobility changes on road traffic safety. Using traffic accident data from the city of Los Angeles and New York City, we find that the impact is not merely a blunt reduction in traffic and accidents; rather, (1) the proportion of accidents unexpectedly increases for ""Hispanic"" and ""Male"" groups; (2) the ""hot spots"" of accidents have shifted in both time and space and are likely moved from higher-income areas (e.g., Hollywood and Lower Manhattan) to lower-income areas (e.g., southern LA and southern Brooklyn); (3) the severity level of accidents decreases with the number of accidents regardless of transportation modes. Understanding those variations of traffic accidents not only sheds a light on the heterogeneous impact of COVID-19 across demographic and geographic factors, but also helps policymakers and planners design more effective safety policies and interventions during critical conditions such as the pandemic.","Lin, Lei; Shi, Feng; Li, Weizi",Sci Rep,,557
481227,The National Academy of Medicine Social Care Framework and COVID-19 Care Innovations,2021,"INTRODUCTION Mass masking is emerging as a key non-pharmaceutical intervention for reducing community spread of COVID-19. However, although hand washing, social distancing and bubble living have been widely adopted by the 'team of 5 million', mass masking has not been socialised to the general population. AIM To identify factors associated with face masking in New Zealand during COVID-19 Alert Level 4 lockdown to inform strategies to socialise and support mass masking. METHODS A quantitative online survey conducted in New Zealand during April 2020 invited residents aged &#8805;18 years to complete a questionnaire. Questions about face masking were included in the survey. The sample was drawn from a commissioned research panel survey, with boosted sampling for Maori and Pacific participants. Responses were weighted to reflect the New Zealand population for all analyses. RESULTS A total of 1015 individuals participated. Self-reported beliefs were strongly related to behaviours, with respondents viewing face masking measures as 'somewhat' or 'very' effective in preventing them from contracting COVID-19 more likely to report having worn a face mask than respondents who viewed them as 'not at all' effective. The strongest barriers to face mask use included beliefs that there was a mask shortage and that the needs of others were greater than their own. DISCUSSION Highlighting the efficacy of and dispelling myths about the relative efficacy of mask types and socialising people to the purpose of mass masking will contribute to community protective actions of mask wearing in the New Zealand response to COVID-19.","Gray, Lesley; MacDonald, Carol; Tassell-Matamua, Natasha; Stanley, James; Kvalsvig, Amanda; Zhang, Jane; Murton, Samantha; Wiles, Siouxsie; Puloka, Viliami; Becker, Julia; Johnston, David; Baker, Michael G",J Prim Health Care,,557

483925,Pool Testing as a Strategy for Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 Outbreaks in Schools: Protocol for a Feasibility Study,2021,"PURPOSE: To evaluate whether use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with a reduced likelihood of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the early weeks of the pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted to determine selected treatment outcomes in 336 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at an acute care community hospital in the Hudson Valley region of New York from March 20 to April 20, 2020. Eligibility included admission to the hospital, a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and no need for intubation or intensive care at admission. The median (interquartile range) ages of patients who received hydroxychloroquine (n = 188) and those who did not (n = 148) were 68 (58-82) and 64 (51-73) years, respectively. In a multivariable model that included age, gender, obesity, diabetes, and hydroxychloroquine use, patients who received hydroxychloroquine were significantly more likely than those not treated with the drug to be transferred to an ICU (odds ratio, [OR], 8.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.8-17) and significantly more likely to be intubated (OR, 7.99; 95% CI, 3.76-16.91); these associations were not influenced by disease severity. In-hospital mortality did not differ significantly with disease severity between those who did and those who did not receive hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSION: Hydroxychloroquine use was significantly associated with increased risks of ICU admission and intubation in patients with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of COVID-19. There were no significant between-group differences in mortality with use vs nonuse of hydroxychloroquine.","Awad, Nirvana; Schiller, Daryl S; Fulman, Magda; Chak, Azfar",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,557

In this study it is proposed compounds that can be developed as adjuvant / complementary drugs against COVID-19. Through a search for molecular docking, for the development of a new drug using pharmacological compounds targeting the b1 region in neuropilin-1 (NRP1), which is important for the interaction with the S1 region of the S-Protein of SARS-CoV-2, to slow down the infection process of this virus. A molecular docking was performed using almost 500,000 compounds targeted to interact in the region between amino acids (Thr316, Asp320, Ser346, Thr349, and Tyr353) in NRP1 to determine compounds able to hinder the interaction with the S1 region in the S-Protein. In this study, ten compounds are proposed as potential inhibitors between S1 region in the S-Protein of SARS-CoV-2 with the b1 region in NRP1, to develop a new adjuvant / complementary drug against COVID-19, and to hinder the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and human cells, with a high probability to be safe in humans, validated by web servers for prediction of ADME and toxicity (PreADMET).","Vique-Sánchez, José Luis",Bioorg Med Chem,,557
486399,Ebola Outbreak amid COVID-19 in the Republic of Guinea: Priorities for Achieving Control,2021,"INTRODUCTION: A novel coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, caused an international outbreak of a respiratory illness, termed COVID-19 in December 2019. There is a lack of specific therapeutic agents based on evidence for this novel coronavirus infection; however, several medications have been evaluated as a potential therapy. Therapy is required to treat symptomatic patients and decrease the virus carriage duration to limit the communitytransmission. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We hypothesise that patients with mild COVID-19 treated with favipiravir will have a shorter duration of time to virus clearance than the control group. The primary outcome is to evaluate the effect of favipiravir on the timing of the PCR test conversion from positive to negative within 15 days after starting the medicine.Adults (>18 years, men or nonpregnant women, diagnosed with mild COVID-19 within 5 days of disease onset) are being recruited by physicians participating from the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs and the Ministry of Health ethics committee approved primary healthcare centres. This double-blind, randomised trial comprises three significant parts: screening, treatment and a follow-up period. The treating physician and patients are blinded. Eligible participants are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the therapy group (favipiravir) or a control group (placebo) with 1800 mg by mouth two times per day for the first day, followed by 800 mg two times per day for 4-7 days. Serial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab samples are obtained on day 1 (5 days before therapy). On day5±1 day, 10±1 day, 15±2 days, extra nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal PCR COVID-19 samples are requested.The primary analysis population for evaluating both the efficacy and safety outcomes will be a modified intention to treat population. Anticipating a 10% dropout rate, we expect to recruit 288 subjects per arm. The results assume that the hazard ratio is constant throughout the study and that the Cox proportional hazard regression is used to analyse the data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the King Abdullah International Medical Research Centre Institutional Review Board (28 April 2020) and the Ministry of Health Institutional Review Board (1 July 2020).

490988,From the Editors Desk: Climate Change in Clinic,2020,"BACKGROUNDT cell responses to the common cold coronaviruses have not been well characterized. Preexisting T cell immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been reported, and a recent study suggested that this immunity was due to cross-recognition of the novel coronavirus by T cells specific for the common cold coronaviruses.METHODSWe used the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay to characterize the T cell responses against peptide pools derived from the spike protein of 3 common cold coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) and SARS-CoV-2 in 21 healthy donors (HDs) who were seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 and had no known exposure to the virus. An in vitro expansion culture assay was also used to analyze memory T cell responses.RESULTSWe found responses to the spike protein of the 3 common cold coronaviruses in many of the donors. We then focused on HCoV-NL63 and detected broad T cell responses to the spike protein and identified 22 targeted peptides. Interestingly, only 1 study participant had a significant response to SARS-CoV-2 spike or nucleocapsid protein in the ELISPOT assay. In vitro expansion studies suggested that T cells specific for the HCoV-NL63 spike protein in this individual could also recognize SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide pools.CONCLUSIONHDs have circulating T cells specific for the spike proteins of HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43. T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins were present in only 1 participant and were potentially the result of cross-recognition by T cells specific for the common cold coronaviruses. Further studies are needed to determine whether this cross-recognition influences coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes.","Woldemeskel, Bezawit A; Kwaa, Abena K; Garliss, Caroline C; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Ray, Stuart C; Blankson, Joel N",J Clin Invest,,557
493936,Monitoring perception of risk and disruption to medical supplies in people with type 1 diabetes during the covid-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Burnout is more common among healthcare professionals, that is an important problem of professional distress that can seriously affect healthcare professionals' emotional state, health, medical quality and doctor-patient relationship. However, only few studies researched the burnout status of healthcare professionals who care for patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness. The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of burnout and related contributing personal and environment factors in healthcare professionals managing these patients. METHODS: Institution-based cross-sectional study. Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey was used to evaluate burnout in professionals who specially care for patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness in the neurorehabilitation department. RESULTS: A total of 200 questionnaires were distributed, 121 were collected, among them 93 questionnaires could be used for further analysis. In this study, 61 participants (65.6%) showed burnout (55.2% physicians and 82.9% nurses). For the risks and Maslach Burnout Inventory scores, emotional exhaustion and depersonalization were correlated with age, gender, occupation, marital status, years of practice, and education level. Reduced personal accomplishment was correlated with marital status. The variables of age (< 29 years old), occupation (nurses), marital status (unmarried), years of practice (< 5 years), and educational level (&#8804; Undergraduate) were associated with high levels of burnout. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals who care for patients with disorders of consciousness experienced high levels of burnout. Especially those who were younger, nurse, unmarried, less practice experience or lower educational levels were more likely to experience high burnout.","Wang, Jing; Wang, Wenting; Laureys, Steven; Di, Haibo",BMC Health Serv Res,,557

METHODS: The most efficient pool size was determined to be five specimens using a web-based application. From this analysis, 25 experimental pools were created using 50 µL from one SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal specimen mixed with 4 negative patient specimens (50 µL each) for a total volume of 250 µL. Viral RNA was subsequently extracted from each pool and tested using the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. Positive pools were consequently split into individual specimens and tested by extraction and PCR. This method was also tested on an unselected group of 60 nasopharyngeal specimens grouped into 12 pools. RESULTS: All 25 pools were positive with cycle threshold (Ct) values within 0 and 5.03 Ct of the original individual specimens. The analysis of 60 specimens determined that 2 pools were positive followed by identification of 2 individual specimens among the 60 tested. This testing was accomplished while using 22 extractions/PCR tests, a savings of 38 reactions. CONCLUSIONS: When the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 10% or less, group testing will result in the saving of reagents and personnel time with an overall increase in testing capability of at least 69%.","Abdalhamid, Baha; Bilder, Christopher R; McCutchen, Emily L; Hinrichs, Steven H; Koepsell, Scott A; Iwen, Peter C",Am J Clin Pathol,,557

Therefore, this study researches the hitherto understudied concept of vaccination concern and its theoretical scope in the international travel space. It attempts a conceptualization of the concept by delimiting its theoretical scope and proposes a measure for it. An exploratory sequential mixed-methods design was used to conduct four interlocking studies using data from a netnography, field interviews, and surveys among varied international travelers. A scale with six dimensions, comprising safety, efficacy, cost, time, access, and autonomy concerns were revealed. The scale significantly explained mainstream and segments-based tourists' uptake attitudes and behavior for their eligible vaccines. The findings suggest that anti-travel vax sentiments and public vax sentiments despite conceptually similar are considerably distinct. The broad nature of the scale and its prediction of travelers' vaccine uptake make it clinically relevant for tracking and resolving concerns for increased vaccine uptake.

504518,Interest Consistency Can Buffer the Effect of COVID-19 Fear on Psychological Distress,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an emergent infectious disease that has spread geographically to become a global pandemic. While much research focuses on the epidemiological and virological aspects of COVID-19 transmission, there remains an important gap in knowledge regarding the drivers of geographical diffusion between places, in particular at the global scale. Here, we use quantile regression to model the roles of globalisation, human settlement and population characteristics as socio-spatial determinants of reported COVID-19 diffusion over a six-week period in March and April 2020. Our exploratory analysis is based on reported COVID-19 data published by Johns Hopkins University which, despite its limitations, serves as the best repository of reported COVID-19 cases across nations. RESULTS: The quantile regression model suggests that globalisation, settlement, and population characteristics related to high human mobility and interaction predict reported disease diffusion. Human development level (HDI) and total population predict COVID-19 diffusion in countries with a high number of total reported cases (per million) whereas larger household size, older populations, and globalisation tied to human interaction predict COVID-19 diffusion in countries with a low number of total reported cases (per million). Population density, and population characteristics such as total population, older populations, and household size are strong predictors in early weeks but have a muted impact over time on reported COVID-19 diffusion. In contrast, the impacts of interpersonal and trade globalisation are enhanced over time, indicating that human mobility may best explain sustained disease diffusion. CONCLUSIONS: Model results confirm that globalisation, settlement and population characteristics, and variables tied to high human mobility lead to greater reported disease diffusion. These outcomes serve to inform suppression strategies, particularly as they are related to anticipated relocation diffusion from more- to less-developed countries and regions, and hierarchical diffusion from countries with higher population and density. It is likely that many of these processes are replicated at smaller geographical scales both within countries and within regions. Epidemiological strategies must therefore be tailored according to human mobility patterns, as well as countries' settlement and population characteristics. We suggest that limiting human mobility to the greatest extent practical will best restrain COVID-19 diffusion, which in the absence of widespread vaccination may be one of the best lines of epidemiological defense.","Sigler, Thomas; Mahmuda, Sirat; Kimpton, Anthony; Loginova, Julia; Wohland, Pia; Charles-Edwards, Elin; Corcoran, Jonathan",Global Health,,557

507817,Management of obstetrics and gynaecological patients with COVID-19,2020,"The objectives are to present an updated synopsis on osteosarcopenic adiposity (OSA) syndrome and evaluate the roles of selected micronutrients in its prevention and management. OSA refers to the concurrent deterioration of bone (osteopenia/osteoporosis), muscle (sarcopenia) and adipose tissue expansion. It portrays the most advanced stage in a continuum of body composition disorders. Although OSA has been widely studied involving the populations of different backgrounds, its prevalence is hard to collate because different methodologies and criteria were used for its diagnosis. Another critical health aspect is the presence of low-grade chronic inflammation (LGCI) which contributes to OSA and vice versa. Nutrition is important in the prevention and management of both OSA and LGCI. Although micronutrients act in numerous metabolic and physiological processes, their roles here are presented in relation to OSA (and its components) and LGCI in general and relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. These include calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium and vitamins D and K; their interactions, physiological ratios and synergism/antagonism are discussed as well. In conclusion, calcium, magnesium and vitamin D have a profound impact on OSA and its components, and the latter two also on LGCI. Potassium and vitamin K are vital in bone, muscle functioning and possibly adipose tissue modification. Both, but particularly vitamin D, surfaced as important modulators of immune system with application in COVID-19 infections. While both phosphorus and sodium have important roles in bone, muscle and can impact adiposity, due to their abundance in food, their intake should be curbed to prevent possible damaging effects.","Ilich, Jasminka Z",Proc Nutr Soc,,557

509804,Implementation of an Algorithm of Cohort Classification to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19 in Nursing Homes,2020,"During normal and predictable circumstances, employees' occupational calling (i.e., a transcendent passion to use their talent and competencies toward positive societal impact and a sense of meaningfulness derived from working in a chosen occupational domain) is observed to be relatively stable. However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, circumstances have become anything but normal and predictable, thus putting employees' sense of occupational calling to the test. In this study, we investigate the possibility that occupational calling fluctuates across days during situations of crisis, and we identify antecedents and consequence of such fluctuations. To test our model, we conducted a daily diary study of 66 nurses working in intensive care units over 5 consecutive work days in a specialized Wuhan hospital that only admitted confirmed COVID-19 patients during the peak of the pandemic in China. We found that the daily number of code blue events (i.e., cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts with the primary goal of patient revival) was positively related to daily occupational calling for nurses. Moreover, individual differences in prosocial motivation predicted the average level and variability of occupational calling over the 5 days, which subsequently related to the nurses' job performance. Our study sheds light on how occupational calling enables people with the needed occupational knowledge and skills to function effectively in crisis situations.

The objective of this observational study was to assess if lung function remained impaired at 16 to 19 years of age in those who had received postnatal corticosteroids and whether the trajectory of lung function with increasing age differed between those who had and had not received corticosteroids. One hundred and fifty-nine children born prior to 29 weeks of gestational age had comprehensive lung function measurements; 49 had received postnatal dexamethasone. Lung function outcomes were compared between those who had and had not received postnatal dexamethasone after adjustment for neonatal factors. Forced expiratory flow at 75%, 50%, 25% and 25-75% of the expired vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second, peak expiratory flow and forced vital capacity and lung volumes (total lung capacity and residual volume) were assessed. The majority of results were significantly lower in those who received dexamethasone (between 0.61 to 0.78 standard deviations). Lung function reduced as the number of courses of dexamethasone increased. Between 11 and 14 years and 16 to 19 years, lung function improved in the unexposed group, but forced expiratory flow at 75% of the expired vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second deteriorated in those who had received postnatal corticosteroids (p = 0.0006). These results suggest that prematurely born young people who received postnatal corticosteroids may be at risk of premature onset of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","Harris, Christopher; Bisquera, Alessandra; Zivanovic, Sanja; Lunt, Alan; Calvert, Sandy; Marlow, Neil; Peacock, Janet L; Greenough, Anne",PLoS One,,557

Here, we analyzed the impact of COVID-19 infection in renal patients to assess the time to viral clearance, together with the production and persistence of IgG and IgM antibody response, in consideration of the altered immune capacity of this fragile population. METHODS: Viral clearance and antibody kinetics were investigated in 49 renal patients recovered from COVID-19 infection: 7 of them with chronic decompensated renal failure, 31 under dialysis treatment, and 11 kidney transplant recipients. RESULTS: The time span between the diagnosis of infection and recovery based on laboratory testing (2 negative nasopharyngeal swabs in consecutive days) was 31.7 ± 13.3 days. Three new positive cases were detected from 8 to 13 days following recovery. At the first serological determination after swab negativization, all the patients developed IgG and IgM antibodies. The semiquantitative analysis showed a progressive increase in IgG and a slow reduction in IgM. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: In subjects with decompensated chronic kidney disease, under dialysis and in transplant recipients, viral clearance is lengthened compared to the general population. However, in spite of their common status of immunodepression, all of them were able to produce specific antibodies. These data might provide useful insights for monitoring and planning health-care activities in the weak category of patients with compromised renal function recovered from COVID-19.","Bruno, Paolo Ferdinando; Cappuccilli, Maria; Spazzoli, Alessandra; De Liberali, Matteo; Sejdiu, Brunilda; Napoli, Marianna; Minerva, Vera; Semprini, Simona; Dirani, Giorgio; Sambri, Vittorio; Buscaroli, Andrea; Rigotti, Angelo; Mancini, Elena; Masperi, Paolo; La Manna, Gaetano; Mosconi, Giovanni",Nephron,,557

518838,COVID-19: Magnifying the Effect of Health Disparities,2020,"COVID-19 disease induced by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 presents among its symptoms alterations of the chemosensory functions. In the first studies on the Chinese population, this symptomatology was not particularly relevant, and hyposmia and hypogeusia were excluded from the symptoms to be evaluated to diagnose the disease. With the pandemic spread of the illness, there has been an augment in reports on chemosensory dysfunctions among patients. The first data analysis showed the presence of these disorders mainly in paucisymptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The interest in chemosensory systems therefore increased considerably, because the olfactory and gustatory symptoms could be the key to stop the infection spread. Furthermore, the degree of alert and attention grew, considering that these types of dysfunctions are prognostic symptoms of serious neurodegenerative diseases. About 9 months have passed since the first anecdotal reports on the involvement of the olfactory and gustatory systems in the COVID-19 pathology. For this reason, a careful review of the literature was conducted to understand if it is clearer which people present chemosensory symptoms and if these are related to the severity of the disease. Furthermore, we have identified which aspects still remain to be clarified.","Veronese, Sheila; Sbarbati, Andrea",ACS Chem Neurosci,,557

However, the impact of the host microbiome on infection outcomes has not been explored in this model, partly due to the lack of a comprehensive characterization of microbial communities across different cotton rat species. Understanding the dynamics of their microbiome could significantly help to better understand its role when modeling viral infections in this animal model. RESULTS: We examined the bacterial communities of the gut and three external sites (skin, ear, and nose) of two inbred species of cotton rats commonly used in research (S. hispidus and S. fulviventer) by using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, constituting the first comprehensive characterization of the cotton rat microbiome. We showed that S. fulviventer maintained higher alpha diversity and richness than S. hispidus at external sites (skin, ear, nose), but there were no differentially abundant genera. However, S. fulviventer and S. hispidus had distinct fecal microbiomes composed of several significantly differentially abundant genera. Whole metagenomic shotgun sequencing of fecal samples identified species-level differences between S. hispidus and S. fulviventer, as well as different metabolic pathway functions as a result of differential host microbiome contributions. Furthermore, the microbiome composition of the external sites showed significant sex-based differences while fecal communities were not largely different. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that host genetic background potentially exerts homeostatic pressures, resulting in distinct microbiomes for two different inbred cotton rat species. Because of the numerous studies that have uncovered strong relationships between host microbiome, viral infection outcomes, and immune responses, our findings represent a strong contribution for understanding the impact of different microbial communities on viral pathogenesis. Furthermore, we provide novel cotton rat microbiome data as a springboard to uncover the full therapeutic potential of the microbiome against viral infections.

Evaluation of a disease surveillance system is important to ensure its performance over time. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of the core and support functions of the Zanzibar integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) system to determine its capacity for early detection of and response to infectious disease outbreaks. METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive study involved 10 districts of Zanzibar and 45 public and private health facilities. A mixed-methods approach was used to collect data. This included document review, observations and interviews with surveillance personnel using a modified World Health Organization generic questionnaire for assessing national disease surveillance systems. RESULTS: The performance of the IDSR system in Zanzibar was suboptimal particularly with respect to early detection of epidemics. Weak laboratory capacity at all levels greatly hampered detection and confirmation of cases and outbreaks. None of the health facilities or laboratories could confirm all priority infectious diseases outlined in the Zanzibar IDSR guidelines. Data reporting was weakest at facility level, while data analysis was inadequate at all levels (facility, district and national). The performance of epidemic preparedness and response was generally unsatisfactory despite availability of rapid response teams and budget lines for epidemics in each district. The support functions (supervision, training, laboratory, communication and coordination, human resources, logistic support) were inadequate particularly at the facility level. CONCLUSIONS: The IDSR system in Zanzibar is weak and inadequate for early detection and response to infectious disease epidemics. The performance of both core and support functions are hampered by several factors including inadequate human and material resources as well as lack of motivation for IDSR implementation within the healthcare delivery system. In the face of emerging epidemics, strengthening of the IDSR system, including allocation of adequate resources, should be a priority in order to safeguard human health and economic stability across the archipelago of Zanzibar.","Saleh, Fatma; Kitau, Jovin; Konradsen, Flemming; Mboera, Leonard E.

In this regard, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of high-pressure treatment (500 MPa for 2 min at a temperature of 4 °C) on changes in quality on two different kinds of fresh fish fillets (Salmo salar and Pleuronectes platessa). Specifically, physico-chemical (VOCs, untargeted metabolomics spectra, pH and color), microbiological (Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp., mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria) and sensory traits were evaluated at different days of refrigerated storage. From the results obtained, it is possible to state that the high pressure significantly (p ≤ 0.05) reduced microbial growth for each investigated microorganism. Regarding the colorimetric coordinates, no remarkable effects on a* and b* indices were found, while a significant effect (p = 0.01) was observed on the colorimetric index L*, making the HP-treated samples lighter than their respective controls. The sensory analysis showed that for the odor attribute, the HP treatment seems to have had a stabilizing action during shelf-life. Moreover, the treated samples obtained a better score than the respective controls (p ≤ 0.05). With regards to texture and appearance attributes, the treatment seems to have had a significant (p ≤ 0.05) effect, making the treated samples more compact and opaque than controls, therefore resulting in the loss of the characteristics of raw fish for the treated samples. Moreover, from a chemical point of view, HP treatment prevents the development of volatile sulfides and delays the formation of histamine (p ≤ 0.05).

The researchers used the dengue surveillance data published by the Malaysian Ministry of Health during the 3 phases of MCO (which ranged between 17th March 2020 and 28(th) April 2020) was used for determining the cumulative number of dengue patients. Thereafter, the dengue cases were mapped using the Geographical Information System (GIS). The results indicated that during the 42 days of MCO in Peninsular Malaysia, 11,242 total cases of dengue were reported. The daily trend of the dengue cases showed a decrease from 7268 cases that occurred before the MCOs to 4662 dengue cases that occurred during the initial 14 days of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., MCO I), to 3075 cases occurring during the MCO II and 3505 dengue cases noted during MCO III. The central peninsular region showed a maximal decrease in new dengue cases (52.62%), followed by the northern peninsular region (1.89%); eastern coastal region (1.25%) and the southern peninsular region (1.14%) during the initial MCO implementation. However, an increase in the new dengue cases was noted during the MCO III period, wherein all states showed an increase in the new dengue cases as compared during MCO II. The decrease in the pattern was not solely based on the MCO, hence, further investigation is necessary after considering different influencing factors. These results have important implication for future large-scale risk assessment, planning and hazard mitigation on dengue management.","Rahim, Mohd Hafiz; Dom, Nazri Che; Ismail, Sharifah Norkhadijah Syed; Mulud, Zamzaliza Abd; Abdullah, Samsuri; Pradhan, Biswajeet",One Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33553566/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2021.100222; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771421000124; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352771421000124,557

Therefore, it is necessary for nurses to deal with the spiritual issues of patients. Also, a valid and reliable scale is needed to measure nurse-provided spiritual care. So the purpose of this study was to determine the validity and reliability of the Persian version of the “Nurse Spiritual Care Therapeutics Scale” in Iranian nurses. METHOD: In a methodological study, English version of the Nurse Spiritual Care Therapeutics Scale was translated into Persian by forward–backward translation procedure. Face validity was assessed by cognitive interview, and content validity was assessed by a panel of experts. In addition, construct validity was assessed by exploratory factor analysis. The participants were 188 nurses working in different adult wards. Reliability was measured using the Cronbach’s alpha and stability reliability was assessed using the internal correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: In assessing the construct validity, two factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 were identified, which explained 58.47% of the total variance. Cronbach’s alpha value was 0.932, and ICC was 0.892. CONCLUSION: As a result, the Persian version of the Nurse Spiritual Care Therapeutics Scale shows a good validity and reliability. Therefore, this scale can be used to evaluate spiritual care at the bedside in Iran.","Merati-Fashi, Fatemeh; Khaledi-Paveh, Behnam; Mosafer, Hadis; Ebadi, Abbas",BMC Palliat Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33845815/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12904-021-00750-1,557

However, limited data are available comparing these cough simulations to physiological breathing and coughing. In this study, three different cough simulators (Teleflex Mucosal Atomization Device Nasal (MAD Nasal), a spray gun, and GloGerm(TM) MIST) that have been used in the literature were studied to assess their physiologic relevance. Droplet size, velocity, dispersion, and force generated by the simulators were measured. Droplet size was measured with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Slow-motion videography was used to 3D reconstruct and measure the velocity of each simulated cough. A force-sensitive resistor was used to measure the force of each simulated cough. The average size of droplets from each cough simulator was 176 to 220 µm. MAD Nasal, the spray gun, and GloGerm(TM) MIST traveled 0.38 m, 0.89 m, and 1.62 m respectively. The average velocities for the MAD Nasal, spray gun, and GloGerm(TM) MIST were 1.57 m/s, 2.60 m/s, and 9.27 m/s respectively, and all yielded a force of <0.5 Newtons. GloGerm(TM) MIST and the spray gun most closely resemble physiological coughs and breathing respectively. In conclusion, none of the simulators tested accurately modeled all physiologic characteristics (droplet size, 3-D dispersion velocity, and force) of a cough, while there were various strengths and weaknesses of each method. One should take this into account when performing simulations with these devices.","Patel, Shiv H.; Yim, Wonjun; Garg, Anupam K.; Shah, Sahil H.; Jokerst, Jesse V.; Chao, Daniel L.",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9093002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32957639/,557
597392,Impact of Social Distancing on Individuals Who Use Drugs: Considerations for Emergency Department Providers,2020-08-18,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 and human infections have resulted in a global health emergency. Small animal models that reproduce key elements of SARS-CoV-2 human infections are needed to rigorously screen candidate drugs to mitigate severe disease and prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We and others have reported that transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) viral receptor under the control of the Keratin 18 (K18) promoter develop severe and lethal respiratory disease subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 intranasal challenge. Here we report that some infected mice that survive challenge have residual pulmonary damages and persistent brain infection on day 28 post-infection despite the presence of anti-SARS-COV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Because of the hypersensitivity of K18-hACE2 mice to SARS-CoV-2 and the propensity of virus to infect the brain, we sought to determine if anti-infective biologics could protect against disease in this model system. We demonstrate that anti-SARS-CoV-2 human convalescent plasma protects K18-hACE2 against severe disease. All control mice succumbed to disease by day 7; however, all treated mice survived infection without observable signs of disease. In marked contrast to control mice, viral antigen and lesions were reduced or absent from lungs and absent in brains of antibody-treated mice. Our findings support the use of K18-hACE2 mice for protective efficacy studies of anti-SARS-CoV-2 medical countermeasures (MCMs). They also support the use of this system to study SARS-CoV-2 persistence and host recovery.","Golden, Joseph W.; Zeng, Xiankun; Cline, Curtis R.; Garrison, Aura R.; White, Lauren E.; Fitzpatrick, Collin J.; Kwilas, Steven A.; Bowling, Philip A.; Fiallos, Jimmy O.; Moore, Joshua L.; Sifford, Willie B.; Ricks, Keersten M.; Mucker, Eric M.; Smith, Jeffrey M.; Hooper, Jay W.",J Gen Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33961540/; https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001599,557

The results show that among Latinas, knowing an undocumented immigrant and someone ill with COVID-19 increases the probability of reporting worse mental outcomes by 52 percent. Furthermore, being a woman increases the probability of reporting the highest level of mental health problems by 30 percent among Hispanic people who know someone with COVID-19 and an undocumented immigrant.

It produces the aforementioned disease due to coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and has led to a declaration of a world public health emergency by the World Health Organisation. This new SARS-CoV2 virus could share characteristics and an immune response similar to those described for other coronavirus. Given its activity on the interferon pathway, and the manner in which it dysregulates innate immunity, the use of treatments directed at modulating or containing this could be of interest. A narrative review was made of the current evidence about immunity against coronavirus and it applicability to SARS-CoV2.

Diagnostic laboratories are expected to provide appropriate testing with maximum accuracy. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is the diagnostic standard yet many commercial diagnostic kits have become available. However, only a handful of studies have reviewed their performance in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the overall analytical matrix including the extraction kit (BD MAX, Promega, Qiagen), the PCR instrument (Agilent Mx3005P, BD MAX, Qiagen Rotor-Gene, Roche Cobas z 480) and the RT-PCR assay (Altona Diagnostics, CerTest Biotec, R-Biopharm AG) using predefined samples from proficiency testing organizers. The greatest difference of the Ct values between the matrices was 9 cycles. One borderline sample could not be detected by 3 out of 12 analytical matrices and yielded a false negative result. We therefore conclude that diagnostic laboratories should take the complete analytical matrix in addition to the performance values published by the manufacturer for a respective RT-PCR kit into account. With limited resources laboratories have to validate a wide range of kits to determine appropriate analytical matrices for detecting SARS-CoV-2 reliably. The interpretation of clinical results has to be adapted accordingly.","Malecki, M.; Luesebrink, J.; Wendel, A.; Mattner, F.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.18.20185744; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20185744v1?rss=1,557

Numerous reports have yielded insights into the function of compounds based on the dispirotripiperazine scaffold. Analysis suggests that this is a structural requirement for inhibiting the interactions between viruses and cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, thus preventing virus entry and replication.

603202,The National Academy of Medicine Social Care Framework and COVID-19 Care Innovations,2021-01-19,"Introduction: In an attempt to improve outcomes for patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), several drugs, such as remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine (with or without azithromycin), and lopinavir/ritonavir, have been evaluated for treatment. While much attention focuses on potential benefits of these drugs, this must be weighed against their adverse effects. Methods: We searched 32 databases in multiple languages from 1 December 2019 to 27 October 2020. We included randomized trials if they compared any of the drugs of interest to placebo or standard care, or against each other. A related world health organization (WHO) guideline panel selected the interventions to address and identified possible adverse effects that might be important to patients. Pairs of reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We analyzed data using a fixed-effects pairwise meta-analysis and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Results: We included 16 randomized trials which enrolled 8226 patients. Compared to standard care or placebo, low certainty evidence suggests that remdesivir may not have an important effect on acute kidney injury (risk difference [RD] 8 fewer per 1000, 95% confidence interval (CI): 27 fewer to 21 more) or cognitive dysfunction/delirium (RD 3 more per 1000, 95% CI: 12 fewer to 19 more). Low certainty evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine may increase the risk of serious cardiac toxicity (RD 10 more per 1000, 95% CI: 0 more to 30 more) and cognitive dysfunction/delirium (RD 33 more per 1000, 95% CI: 18 fewer to 84 more), whereas moderate certainty evidence suggests hydroxychloroquine probably increases the risk of diarrhoea (RD 106 more per 1000, 95% CI: 48 more to 175 more) and nausea and/or vomiting (RD 62 more per 1000, 95% CI: 23 more to 110 more) compared to standard care or placebo. Low certainty evidence suggests lopinavir/ritonavir may increase the risk of diarrhoea (RD 168 more per 1000, 95% CI: 58 more to 330 more) and nausea and/or vomiting (RD 160 more per 1000, 95% CI: 100 more to 210 more) compared to standard care or placebo. Conclusion: Hydroxychloroquine probably increases the risk of diarrhoea and nausea and/or vomiting and may increase the risk of cardiac toxicity and cognitive dysfunction/delirium. Remdesivir may have no effect on risk of acute kidney injury or cognitive dysfunction/delirium. Lopinavir/ritonavir may increase the risk of diarrhoea and nausea and/or vomiting. These finding provide important information to support the development of evidence-based management strategies for patients with COVID-19.","Izcovich, A.; Siemieniuk, R.; Bartoszko, J.

604565,The Role of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons in COVID-19 Response,2020-04-14,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has raised interest in the kinin–kallikrein system. Viral blockade of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 impedes degradation of the active kinin des-Arg(9)-bradykinin, which thus increasingly activates bradykinin receptors known to promote inflammation, cough, and edema—symptoms that are commonly observed in COVID-19. However, lean and reliable investigation of the postulated alterations is currently hindered by non-specific peptide adsorption, lacking sensitivity, and cross-reactivity of applicable assays. Here, an LC–MS/MS method was established to determine the following kinins in respiratory lavage fluids: kallidin, bradykinin, des-Arg(10)-kallidin, des-Arg(9)-bradykinin, bradykinin 1-7, bradykinin 2-9 and bradykinin 1-5. This method was fully validated according to regulatory bioanalytical guidelines of the European Medicine Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration and has a broad calibration curve range (up to a factor of 10(3)), encompassing low quantification limits of 4.4–22.8 pg/mL (depending on the individual kinin). The application of the developed LC–MS/MS method to nasal lavage fluid allowed for the rapid (~ 2 h), comprehensive and low-volume (100 µL) determination of kinins. Hence, this novel assay may support current efforts to investigate the pathophysiology of COVID-19, but can also be extended to other diseases.","Gangnus, Tanja; Burckhardt, Bjoern B.",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82191-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33542252/,557

However, its application in COVID-19 surveillance has been limited to clinical testing only. We present in this paper two optimized RT-LAMP protocols based on colour change and fluorescence detection and application of these protocols for wastewater monitoring from four wastewater treatment plants over 4 weeks. The optimized RT-LAMP protocols have a limit of detection of 10 copies/25 µl reaction with positive amplification within 35 minutes. Over the 4 weeks of monitoring, the colorimetric protocol detected a prevalence of 12.5%, when 1 µl of extracted RNA with 92.7(± 28.2) ng/µl concentration was analysed. When the RNA template was increased by fivefold, the prevalence increased to 44%. The fluorescent RT-LAMP had a prevalence of 31% and 47% for starting templates of 92.7(± 28.2) ng/µl and 480(± 134.5) ng/µl of the extracted RNA, respectively. All samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 when analysed with droplet digital PCR, with viral loads ranging from 18.1 to 195.6 gc/ml of wastewater. The RT-ddPCR, therefore, confirms the presence of the viral RNA in the wastewater samples, albeit at low concentrations. Additionally, the RT-LAMP protocols positively detected SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples with copies as low as 20.7 gc/ml. The results obtained in our study show the potential application of RT-LAMP for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, which could provide a cheaper and faster alternative to RT-qPCR or RT-ddPCR for wastewater-based epidemiological monitoring of COVID-19 and other viral infections.

The Composite Autonomic Symptom Scale 31 (COMPASS-31) questionnaire is a simple and validated tool to assess dysautonomic symptoms. The aim of the present study was to administer the COMPASS-31 questionnaire to a sample of post-COVID patients with and without neurological complaints. Participants were recruited among the post-COVID ambulatory services for follow-up evaluation between 4 weeks and 9 months from COVID-19 symptoms onset. Participants were asked to complete the COMPASS-31 questionnaire referring to the period after COVID-19 disease. Heart rate and blood pressure were manually taken during an active stand test for OH and POTS diagnosis. One-hundred and eighty participants were included in the analysis (70.6% females, 51 ± 13 years), and OH was found in 13.8% of the subjects. Median COMPASS-31 score was 17.6 (6.9–31.4), with the most affected domains being orthostatic intolerance, sudomotor, gastrointestinal and pupillomotor dysfunction. A higher COMPASS-31 score was found in those with neurological symptoms (p < 0.01), due to more severe orthostatic intolerance symptoms (p < 0.01), although gastrointestinal (p < 0.01), urinary (p < 0.01), and pupillomotor (p < 0.01) domains were more represented in the non-neurological symptoms group.

607372,Understanding factors critical to the implementation of ehealth in chronic disease management: a realist review protocol,2021-07-12,"BACKGROUND: High respiratory drive in mechanically ventilated patients with spontaneous breathing effort may cause excessive lung stress and strain and muscle loading. Therefore, it is important to have a reliable estimate of respiratory effort to guarantee lung and diaphragm protective mechanical ventilation. Recently, a novel non-invasive method was found to detect excessive dynamic transpulmonary driving pressure (∆P(L)) and respiratory muscle pressure (P(mus)) with reasonable accuracy. During the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it was impossible to obtain the gold standard for respiratory effort, esophageal manometry, in every patient. Therefore, we investigated whether this novel non-invasive method could also be applied in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: ∆P(L) and P(mus) were derived from esophageal manometry in COVID-19 patients. In addition, ∆P(L) and P(mus) were computed from the occlusion pressure (∆P(occ)) obtained during an expiratory occlusion maneuver. Measured and computed ∆P(L) and P(mus) were compared and discriminative performance for excessive ∆P(L) and P(mus) was assessed. The relation between occlusion pressure and respiratory effort was also assessed. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included. Patients had a low dynamic lung compliance [24 (20–31) mL/cmH(2)O], high ∆P(L) (25 ± 6 cmH(2)O) and high P(mus) (16 ± 7 cmH(2)O). Low agreement was found between measured and computed ∆P(L) and P(mus). Excessive ∆P(L) > 20 cmH(2)O and P(mus) > 15 cmH(2)O were accurately detected (area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) 1.00 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00–1.00], sensitivity 100% (95% CI, 72–100%) and specificity 100% (95% CI, 16–100%) and AUROC 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90–1.00), sensitivity 100% (95% CI, 54–100%) and specificity 86% (95% CI, 42–100%), respectively). Respiratory effort calculated per minute was highly correlated with ∆P(occ) (for esophageal pressure time product per minute (PTP(es/min)) r(2) = 0.73; P = 0.0002 and work of breathing (WOB) r(2) = 0.85; P < 0.0001).

In recent years, applications of big data and AI in education have made significant headways. This highlights a novel trend in leading-edge educational research. The convenience and embeddedness of data collection within educational technologies, paired with computational techniques have made the analyses of big data a reality. We are moving beyond proof-of-concept demonstrations and applications of techniques, and are beginning to see substantial adoption in many areas of education. The key research trends in the domains of big data and AI are associated with assessment, individualized learning, and precision education. Model-driven data analytics approaches will grow quickly to guide the development, interpretation, and validation of the algorithms. However, conclusions from educational analytics should, of course, be applied with caution. At the education policy level, the government should be devoted to supporting lifelong learning, offering teacher education programs, and protecting personal data. With regard to the education industry, reciprocal and mutually beneficial relationships should be developed in order to enhance academia-industry collaboration. Furthermore, it is important to make sure that technologies are guided by relevant theoretical frameworks and are empirically tested. Lastly, in this paper we advocate an in-depth dialog between supporters of “cold” technology and “warm” humanity so that it can lead to greater understanding among teachers and students about how technology, and specifically, the big data explosion and AI revolution can bring new opportunities (and challenges) that can be best leveraged for pedagogical practices and learning.","Luan, Hui; Geczy, Peter; Lai, Hollis; Gobert, Janice; Yang, Stephen J.

613833,COVID-19 lockdown dropped the rate of paediatric asthma admissions,2020-05-22,"The COVID-2019 pandemic is the most severe acute public health threat of the twenty-first century. To properly address this crisis with both robust testing and novel treatments, we require a deep understanding of the life cycle of the causative agent, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Here, we examine the architecture and self-assembly properties of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, which binds viral RNA and assembles into a filament that is packaged into new virions. We determined a 1.4 Å resolution crystal structure of this protein’s N2b domain, revealing a compact, intertwined dimer very similar to that of related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Using size exclusion chromatography and multi-angle light scattering, we find that this domain forms a dimer in solution, and that addition of the C-terminal spacer B/N3 domain mediates tetramer formation. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we find evidence that at least part of this putatively disordered domain is structured, potentially forming an α-helix that either self-associates or docks against the N2b domain to mediate tetramer formation. Finally, we map the locations of over 4,400 individual amino acid substitutions in the N protein from (~)17,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and find that they are strongly clustered in the protein’s N2a linker domain. The nearly 300 substitutions identified within the N1b and N2b domains cluster away from their functional RNA binding and dimerization interfaces. Overall, this work reveals the architecture and self-assembly properties of a key protein in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. As the N protein is a common target of patient antibodies, this work will also benefit ongoing efforts to develop robust and specific serological tests, and could also benefit the analysis of patient-derived antibodies.","Ye, Qiaozhen; West, Alan M.V.; Silletti, Steve; Corbett, Kevin D.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511359/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.17.100685,557

In this context, obese and overweight individuals infected by COVID-19 are at greater risk of dying. Obesity is treated by three main pharmaceutical approaches, namely suppressing appetite, reducing energy intake by impairing absorption, and increasing energy expenditure. Most compounds used for the latter were first envisaged for other medical uses. However, several candidates are now being developed explicitly for targeting obesity by increasing energy expenditure. This review analyzes the compounds that show anti-obesity activity exerted through the energy expenditure pathway. They are classified on the basis of their development status: FDA-approved, Withdrawn, Clinical Trials, and Under Development.

620966,Why N95 Should Be the Standard for All COVID-19 Inpatient Care,2020-06-29,"Pigs (Sus scrofa) may be important surveillance targets for risk assessment and risk-based control planning against emerging zoonoses. Pigs have high-contact rates with humans and other animals, transmit similar pathogens as humans including CoVs, and serve as reservoirs and intermediate hosts for notable human pandemics. Wild and domestic pigs both interface with humans and each other but have unique ecologies that demand different surveillance strategies. Three fundamental questions shape any surveillance program: where, when, and how can surveillance be conducted to optimize the surveillance objective? Using theory of mechanisms of zoonotic spillover and data on risk factors, we propose a framework for determining where surveillance might begin initially to maximize a detection in each host species at their interface. We illustrate the utility of the framework using data from the United States. We then discuss variables to consider in refining when and how to conduct surveillance. Recent advances in accounting for opportunistic sampling designs and in translating serology samples into infection times provide promising directions for extracting spatio-temporal estimates of disease risk from typical surveillance data. Such robust estimates of population-level disease risk allow surveillance plans to be updated in space and time based on new information (adaptive surveillance) thus optimizing allocation of surveillance resources to maximize the quality of risk assessment insight.","Pepin, Kim M.; Miller, Ryan S.; Wilber, Mark Q.",Prev Vet Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105281; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587721000258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33530012/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587721000258?v=s5,557

623584,Marked Increase in Sales of Erectile Dysfunction Medication During COVID-19,2021-06-25,"We performed a systematic sampling and analysis of airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA in different hospital areas to assess viral spread. Systematic air filtration was performed in rooms with COVID-19 infected patients, in corridors adjacent to these rooms, to rooms of intensive care units, and to rooms with infected and uninfected patients, and in open spaces. RNA was extracted from the filters and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed using the LightMix Modular SARS-CoV-2 E-gene. The highest occurrence of RNA was found in the rooms with COVID-19 patients (mean 2600 c/m(3)) and the adjacent corridor (mean 4000 c/m(3)) which was statistically significant more exposed (p < 0.01). This difference was related to the ventilation systems. As is commonly found in many hospitals, each of the rooms had an individual air inlet and outlet, while in the corridors these devices were located at the distance of every four rooms. There was a significant transfer of viruses from the COVID-19 patients’ rooms to the corridors. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the corridors of ICUs with COVID-19 patients or care rooms of uninfected patients were ten times lower, averages 190 c/m(3) and 180 c/m(3), respectively, without presenting significant differences. In all COVID-19 ICU rooms, patients were intubated and connected to respirators that filtered all exhaled air and prevented virus release, resulting in significantly lower viral concentrations in adjacent corridors. The results show that the greatest risk of nosocomial infection may also occur in hospital areas not directly exposed to the exhaled breath of infected patients. Hospitals should evaluate the ventilation systems of all units to minimize possible contagion and, most importantly, direct monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in the air should be carried out to prevent unexpected viral exposures.","Grimalt, Joan O.; Vílchez, Helem; Fraile-Ribot, Pablo A.; Marco, Esther; Campins, Antoni; Orfila, Jaime; van Drooge, Barend L.; Fanjul, Francisco",Environ Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935121013694; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.112074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34547251/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121013694?v=s5,557

We tailored a program designed to increase positive affect and to decrease depressive symptoms in PLWH to a group format for Black WLWH. We also added skills to increase gender empowerment. We then tested the acceptability and feasibility of this program with 8 Black WLWH. The program was acceptable and relatively feasible, as assessed by women’s participation and feedback about program clarity and helpfulness, which women rated above 9 on a 10-point scale. A few women suggested that optimal delivery point for some skills taught would be shortly after HIV diagnosis. A proof-of-concept program intended to bolster positive emotions and gender empowerment and decrease depression can be tailored for Black WLWH and is relatively feasible and acceptable.

626660,Mounting a Scientifically Informed Response to the Opioid Crisis in the Veterans Health Administration,2020-12-04,"Abstract Most patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have just only mild symptoms, but about 5% are very severe. Although extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) is sometimes used in critically patients with COVID-19, ECMO is only an adjunct, not the main treatment. If the patient's condition deteriorates and it is determined to be irreversible, it is necessary to decide to stop ECMO. A 54-year-old man was admitted on day 6 of onset with a chief complaint of high fever and cough. Computed tomography (CT) showed a ground glass opacity in both lungs, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnosed COVID-19. He was admitted to the hospital and started to receive oxygen and favipiravir. After that, his respiratory condition deteriorated, and he was intubated and ventilated on day 9 of onset, and ECMO was introduced on day 12. Two days after the introduction of ECMO, C-reactive protein (CRP) increased, chest X-p showed no improvement in pneumonia, and PaO2/FiO2 decreased again. As D-dimer rose and found a blood clot in the ECMO circuit, we had to decide whether to replace the circuit and continue with ECMO or stop ECMO. At this time, the viral load by RT-PCR was drastically reduced to about 1/1750. We decided to continue ECMO therapy and replaced the circuit. The patient's respiratory status subsequently improved and ECMO was stopped on day 21 of onset. In conclusion, viral load measurement by RT-PCR may be one of the indicators for promoting the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients.","Sakamaki, I.; Morinaga, Y.; Tani, H.; Takegoshi, Y.; Fukui, Y.; Kawasuji, H.; Ueno, A.; Miyajima, Y.; Wakasugi, M.; Kawagishi, T.; Kuwano, H.; Hatano, T.; Shibuya, T.; Okudera, H.; Yamamoto, Y.",J Infect Chemother,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X20302944; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2020.08.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X20302944?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32900659/,557

METHODS: A longitudinal follow-up of 1,549 participants was carried out at four different time points during the lockdown in Spain. Questions about the risk of COVID-19, age, SPA, family and personal resources, loneliness, and psychological distress were measured. RESULTS: Changes in loneliness showed a linear longitudinal trajectory through time, but changes in psychological distress showed a U-shaped relationship with time. Age was a relevant predictor of differences in distress, with older people reporting less psychological distress. Change in both dependent variables was related to change in different predictors like family and personal variables and also to negative SPA. DISCUSSION: In a stressful situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults may be more resilient to adverse mental health outcomes by using more adaptive resources that strengthen their resilience. Support is provided for the importance of stereotyped views of the aging process that, independently of chronological age, may put people at risk of suffering adverse mental health outcomes such as loneliness and psychological distress in times of crisis.","Losada-Baltar, Andrés; Martínez-Huertas, José Ángel; Jiménez-Gonzalo, Lucía; Pedroso-Chaparro, María del Sequeros; Gallego-Alberto, Laura; Fernandes-Pires, José; Márquez-González, María",J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci,https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbab012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33438002/,557

OBJECTIVE: To explore the experiences of Black and Latinx communities during the pandemic to better understand their perspectives on COVID-19 mitigation behaviors (eg, mask wearing), testing, and vaccines. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this community-engaged qualitative study conducted with 18 community-based organizations and 4 health care organizations between November 19, 2020, and February 5, 2021, in New Jersey counties severely affected by the pandemic, group and individual interviews were used to purposively sample 111 Black and Latinx individuals. A total of 13 group interviews were organized by race/ethnicity and language: 4 English-speaking groups with Black participants (n = 34), 3 Spanish-speaking groups with Latinx participants (n = 24), and 4 English-speaking groups with Black and Latinx participants (n = 36). To understand the views of health care workers from these communities, 2 additional groups (n = 9) were convened and supplemented with individual interviews. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Description of Black and Latinx participants’ experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and their perspectives on mitigation behaviors, testing, and vaccines. RESULTS: The study included 111 participants (87 women [78.4%]; median age, 43 years [range, 18-93 years]). Participants described the devastating effects of the pandemic on themselves, loved ones, and their community. Their experiences were marked by fear, illness, loss, and separation. These experiences motivated intense information seeking, mitigation behaviors, and testing. Nevertheless, vaccine skepticism was high across all groups. Participants did not trust the vaccine development process and wanted clearer information. Black participants expressed that they did not want to be subjects of experiments. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The remaining unknowns about new vaccines need to be acknowledged and described for Black and Latinx communities to make informed decisions. Ultimately, scientists and public officials need to work transparently to address unanswered questions and work collaboratively with trusted community leaders and health professionals to foster partnered approaches, rather than focusing on marketing campaigns, to eliminate vaccine skepticism.","Jimenez, Manuel E.; Rivera-Núñez, Zorimar; Crabtree, Benjamin F.; Hill, Diane; Pellerano, Maria B.; Devance, Donita; Macenat, Myneka; Lima, Daniel; Martinez Alcaraz, Emmanuel; Ferrante, Jeanne M.; Barrett, Emily S.; Blaser, Martin J.; Panettieri, Reynold A.; Hudson, Shawna V.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34264327/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.17074,557

Methods A population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random dialing was conducted in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020. 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai were randomly sampled. Differences of outcome measures were compared before and during the outbreak, and between two cities. Findings Proportion of respondents visiting wet markets at usual was 23.3% (119/510) in Wuhan and 20.4% (102/501) in Shanghai. During the outbreak, it decreased to 3.1% (16) in Wuhan (p<0.001), and 4.4% (22) in Shanghai (p<0.001). Proportion of those consuming wild animal products declined from 10.2% (52) to 0.6% (3) in Wuhan (p<0.001), and from 5.2% (26) to 0.8% (4) in Shanghai (p<0.001). 79.0% (403) of respondents in Wuhan and 66.9% (335) of respondents in Shanghai supported permanent closure of wet markets (P<0.001). 95% and 92% of respondents supported banning wild animal trade and quarantining Wuhan, and 75% were confident towards containment measures. Females and the more educated were more supportive for the above containment measures. Interpretation The public responded quickly to the outbreak, and reduced exposure to live animals, especially in Wuhan. With high public support in containment measures, better regulation of wet markets and healthy diets should be promoted.","Hou, Zhiyuan; Lin, Leesa; Lu, Liang; Du, Fanxing; Qian, Mengcen; Liang, Yuxia; Zhang, Juanjuan; Yu, Hongjie",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026146,557

The timing of oxygen therapy was considered to have a great influence on the symptomatic relief of hypoxemia and seeking medical intervention, especially in situations with insufficient medical resources, but the evidence on the timing of oxygen therapy is limited. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Medical charts review was carried out to collect the data of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed in Tongji hospital, Wuhan from 30(th) December 2019 to 8(th) March 2020. In this study, the appropriate timing of oxygen therapy and risk factors associated with severe and fatal illness were identified and the effectiveness of antivirus on disease progression was assessed. Among 1362 patients, the prevalence of hypoxia symptoms was significantly higher in those patients with severe and fatal illness than in those with less severe disease. The onset of hypoxia symptoms was most common in the second to third week after symptom onset, and patients with critical and fatal illness experienced these symptoms earlier than those with mild and severe illness. In multivariable analyses, the risk of death increased significantly when oxygen therapy was started more than 2 days after hypoxia symptoms onset among critical patients (OR, 1.92; 95%CI, 1.20 to 3.10). Compared to the critically ill patients without IFN-a, the patients who were treated with IFN-a had a lower mortality (OR, 0.60; 95%CI, 0.39 to 0.91).

Using an encrypted monument that was built to memorialize Dr. Wenliang Li, one of the whistleblowers of China’s coronavirus outbreak, we extensively investigate three definitive dimensions of crypto place in terms of decentralized location, immutable locales and transaction-based sense of place. We then reflect upon the complicated social implications of blockchain technology much beyond purely serving as an alternative cryptocurrency, and further examine how place information is stored, disseminated, and incentivized on blockchain. Through this paper, we investigate the relevance of blockchain to geography studies and discuss how it may enrich the concept of place in today’s data-intensive and decentralized world.","Zhao, Bo; Huang, Xu",Geoforum,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.08.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016718520302219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32895579/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718520302219,557

Many quests to computationally identify treatments against the virus rely on in silico small molecule docking to experimentally determined structures of viral proteins. One limit to these approaches is that protein dynamics are often unaccounted for, leading to overlooking transient, druggable conformational states. Using Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics to enhance sampling of conformational space, we identified cryptic pockets within the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, including some within regions far from the active site. These simulations sampled comparable dynamics and pocket volumes to conventional brute force simulations carried out on two orders of magnitude greater timescales.","Sztain, Terra; Amaro, Rommie; McCammon, J.

633418,COVID-19 Serologic Testing Among the Highest Risk Healthcare Workers,2021-01-19,"The journal Advances in Health Sciences Education: Theory and Practice has, under Geoff Norman’s leadership, promoted a collaborative approach to investigating educationally-savvy and innovative health care practices, where academic medical educators can work closely with healthcare practitioners to improve patient care and safety. But in medical practice in particular this networked approach is often compromised by a lingering, historically conditioned pattern of heroic individualism (under the banner ‘self help’). In an era promising patient-centredness and inter-professional practices, we must ask: ‘when will medicine, and its informing agent medical education, embrace democratic habits and collectivism?’ The symptom of lingering heroic individualism is particularly prominent in North American medical education. This is echoed in widespread resistance to a government-controlled public health, where the USA remains the only advanced economy that fails to provide universal health care. I track a resistance to collectivist medical-educational reform historically from a mid-nineteenth century nexus of influential thinkers who came, some unwittingly, to shape North American medical education within a Protestant-Capitalist individualist tradition. This tradition still lingers, where some doctors recall a fictional ‘golden age’ of medical practice and education, actually long since eclipsed by fluid inter-professional health care team practices. I cast this tension between conservative traditions of individualism and progressive collectivism as a political issue.","Bleakley, Alan",Adv Health Sci Educ Theory Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33125536/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10459-020-10005-y,557
633999,Ebola virus disease: The use of fluorescents as markers of contamination for personal protective equipment,2014-12-24,"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Anaerobes generally constitute a major component of the gut microbiome. They play a significant role in the pathogenesis of infections following disruption of mucosal integrity. Anaerobic organisms are usually difficult to grow and identify and hence may often be overlooked. We present a patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who developed de-novo Prevotella bivia bacteremia, following tocilizumab. CASE PRESENTATION: A 38 year old Caucasian male with morbid obesity and no other past medical history presented to the emergency department with complaints of cough, fever, chills and poor appetite for the past 10 days. Upon arrival, he was profoundly hypoxic with Spo2 70% on ambient air. He tested positive for COVID-19. On physical examination, his BMI was 62 kg/m2, he was febrile, in moderate respiratory distress, cardiopulmonary examination revealed coarse bilateral breath sounds. His physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. His chest radiograph demonstrated hazy opacification in both mid lungs and left lung base suggestive of multifocal pneumonia. CT chest did not reveal evidence of pulmonary embolism. Lower extremity ultrasound was however negative for a DVT. Laboratory findings was significant for elevated C-reactive protein 12.4 mg/dl. Patient was placed on heated high flow nasal cannula and received dexamethasone and tocilizumab. His respiratory status continued to worsen and he was subsequently intubated. Lower respiratory culture was positive for MSSA and patient was started cefepime and vancomycin was added as he clinically continued to decompensate. Within the next week, blood culture was positive for Prevotella bivia and his antibiotic regimen was changed to pipericillin-tazobactam. Repeat blood culture continued to be positive and this time, for Enterococcus faecalis. The antibiotic regimen was further changed to meropenem. Interestingly, on his physical examination, there was no abnormalities on his abdomen or pelvic area. CT abdomen pelvis did not shows any acute abnormalities. Following meropenem initiation, his subsequent blood cultures have been negative for any growth. Patient remains intubated with a guarded prognosis. DISCUSSION: Prevotella bivia is one of several species of bacteria in the genus Prevotella. It is an anaerobic gram negative organism that is found in the oral, vaginal, and gut microbiome. Some of the infections caused by this organism include aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, otitis media, and sinusitis. Various species of Prevotella have been isolated from abscesses and burns close of the mouth, bite, paronychia, urinary tract infection, brain abscess, osteomyelitis, and bacteremia when there is an associated respiratory tract infections. Prevotella bivia bacteremia is highly uncommon. CONCLUSIONS: As we continue to learn more about COVID-19 infection and its treatment modalities, we may come across such unusual scenarios.

The flipped classroom (FC) is currently an innovative pedagogical approach that has high potential to transform the teaching of mathematics. In the case study described in this paper, we investigated one mathematics teacher’s transformation of teaching in two mathematics classrooms through implementing interventions based on FC methods; furthermore, we identified several key points of FC design as well as challenges and opportunities afforded by teaching mathematics in FCs. The results of the study showed that the tasks posed by the teacher, the implemented discourse, teacher feedback and scaffolding, and the teaching–learning environment were changed in FCs, although the approaches used by the teacher to analyze the tasks and students’ learning were similar to those used in non-FCs, which points out the strengths of traditional teaching approaches. The study indicates that although teaching mathematics in FCs created some difficulties for teaching, well-designed FCs offered a great opportunity to promote students’ mathematical thinking and understanding. Overall, the results highlight that through FC, teachers can develop students’ mathematical potential with FCs.","Cevikbas, Mustafa; Kaiser, Gabriele",ZDM,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33042289/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11858-020-01191-5,557

However, little is known about the disease burden and the molecular epidemiology of HAdV. OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively perform a molecular characterization of HAdV positive samples received at Statens Serum Institut during the period 2011–2016 and to compare this with demographic information, geographic location, sample collection date and type and co-infection with other viral pathogens. STUDY DESIGN: 152 HAdV positive samples were genotyped by Sanger sequencing of a fragment of the hexon gene using published primers along with a newly developed primer set for enhanced genotyping of HAdV D. Phylogenetic analysis was used for genotyping and genotypes were compared with epidemiological information. In addition, HAdV burden and co-infection was evaluated for samples tested in laboratory analysis packages. RESULTS: Six out of seven HAdV species were identified and represented by 13 types. Young children (<5 years old) were more likely to be positive for HAdV and co-infections with other gastrointestinal or respiratory viruses were common. Possible outbreaks of ocular infections due to HAdV D could not be confirmed. CONCLUSION: A diverse set of HAdV species were circulating in Denmark in the study period and although possible transmission clusters were identified, this could not be verified with current genotyping methods Young children were commonly affected by HAdV infection and co-infections with other viral pathogens were frequent suggesting a possible underestimation of the real HAdV burden.","Barnadas, Céline; Schmidt, Dennis Jelsbak; Fischer, Thea K.; Fonager, Jannik",J Clin Virol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.04.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29704734/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653218301045; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653218301045,557
637750,Tourism and the Highlands: A cross-sectional study on trauma and orthopaedic service use by tourists in 2017,2020-07-07,"Patient: Female, 67-year-old Final Diagnosis: Rhabdomyolysis Symptoms: Weakness Medication:— Clinical Procedure: — Specialty: Infectious Diseases OBJECTIVE: Rare co-existance of disease or pathology BACKGROUND: Rhabdomyolysis occurs when muscle injury leads to the release of muscle cell constituents into circulation, often leading to significant systemic complications. There are many causes of rhabdomyolysis, and the etiology is often multifactorial or unclear. Current data suggest that acute COVID-19 may cause muscle injury that can lead to rhabdomyolysis, particularly in cases of severe illness requiring prolonged hospitalization; however, data on the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the musculoskeletal system are lacking. CASE REPORT: We present a case of a woman with generalized weakness 1 week following discharge from the hospital after a prolonged admission for severe COVID-19. She was found to have acute kidney injury and elevated creatine kinase (CK) of 1775 U/L (normal 36-234 U/L). Her home medications, including her statin, were held, but her CK continued to rise, peaking at 15 085 U/L, and she developed renal failure necessitating renal replacement therapy. A thorough work-up for the underlying etiology of her rhabdomyolysis was pursued, including testing for autoimmune myositis, statin-associated necrotizing autoimmune myositis, and a muscle biopsy, which were all unrevealing. Ultimately, the patient’s rhabdomyolysis was determined to likely be secondary to a post-viral myopathy from COVID-19. A toxic myopathy from medication use or a delayed critical illness myopathy from her recent prolonged hospitalization could have also contributed. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the wide differential diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis in the setting of recent COVID-19 and prolonged hospitalization. It demonstrates the possibility that muscle injury and resultant rhabdomyolysis may be a late complication of COVID-19 that is not yet fully described in the literature.","Byler, Julie; Harrison, Rebecca; Fell, Lindsey L.",Am J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33963170/; https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.931616,557
639684,Prevention and Treatment of Skin Damage Caused by Personal Protective Equipment: Experience of the First-Line Clinicians Treating 2019-nCoV Infection,2020-03-13,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 infection has spread at an alarming rate with many places showing multiple peaks in incidence. Present study analyzes a total of 332 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from 114 asymptomatic and 218 deceased patients from twenty-one different countries to assess the mutation profile therein in order to establish the correlation between the clinical status and the observed mutations. METHODS: The mining of mutations was carried out using the GISAID CoVSurver (www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/covsurver-mutations-app) with the reference sequence ‘hCoV-19/Wuhan/WIV04/2019’ present in NCBI with Accession number NC-045512.2. The impact of the mutations on SARS-CoV-2 proteins mutation was predicted using PredictSNP1(loschmidt.chemi.muni.cz/predictsnp1) which is a meta-server integrating six predictor tools: SIFT, PhD-SNP, PolyPhen-1, PolyPhen-2, MAPP and SNAP. The iStable integrated server (predictor.nchu.edu.tw/iStable) was used to predict shifts in the protein stability due to mutations. RESULTS: A total of 372 variants were observed in the 332 SARS-CoV-2 sequences with several variants present in multiple patients accounting for a total of 1596 incidences. Asymptomatic and deceased specific mutants constituted 32% and 62% of the repertoire respectively indicating their partial exclusivity. However, the most prevalent mutations were those present in both. Though some parts of the genome are more variable than others but there was clear difference between incidence and prevalence. Non-structural protein 3 (NSP3) with 68 variants had a total of only 105 incidences whereas Spike protein had 346 incidences with just 66 variants. Amongst the Deleterious variants, NSP3 had the highest incidence of 25 followed by NSP2 (16), ORF3a (14) and N (14). Spike protein had just 7 Deleterious variants out of 66. CONCLUSION: Deceased patients have more Deleterious than Neutral variants as compared to the asymptomatic ones. Further, it appears that the Deleterious variants which decrease protein stability are more significant in pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.","Laskar, Rezwanuzzaman; Ali, Safdar",Chem Biol Interact,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009279721002362; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009279721002362?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34303694/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2021.109598,557

Infection resulted in consistently high levels of virus in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts and sporadic occurrences in other distal tissues. A longitudinal cohort revealed a wave of inflammation including a Type-I interferon (IFN-I) response that was evident in all tissues regardless of viral presence, but was insufficient to prevent disease progression.

648495,The Origin of COVID-19 and Why It Matters,2020-07-22,"The outbreak of coronavirus named COVID-19, initially identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has spread rapidly at the global scale. Most countries have rapidly stopped almost all activities including industry, services and transportation of goods and people, thus decreasing air pollution in an unprecedented way, and providing a unique opportunity to study air pollutants. While satellite data have provided visual evidence for the global reduction in air pollution such as nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) worldwide, precise and quantitative information is missing at the local scale. Here we studied changes in particulate matter (PM(2.5), PM(10)), carbon monoxide (CO), NO(2), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) and ozone (O(3)) at 10 urban sites in Hangzhou, a city of 7.03 million inhabitants, and at 1 rural site, before city lockdown, January 1–23, during city lockdown, January 24-February 15, and during resumption, February 16–28, in 2020. Results show that city lockdown induced a sharp decrease in PM(2.5), PM(10), CO, and NO(2) concentrations at both urban and rural sites. The NO(2) decrease is explained by reduction in traffic emissions in the urban areas, and by lower regional transport in rural areas during lockdown, as expected. SO(2) concentrations decreased from 6.3 to 5.3 μg m(−3) in the city, but increased surprisingly from 4.7 to 5.8 μg m(−3) at the rural site: this increase is attributed both to higher coal consumption for heating and emissions from traditional fireworks of the Spring Eve and Lantern Festivals during lockdown. Unexpectedly, O(3) concentrations increased by 145% from 24.6 to 60.6 μg m(−3) in the urban area, and from 42.0 to 62.9 μg m(−3) in the rural area during the lockdown. This finding is explained by the weakening of chemical titration of O(3) by NO due to reductions of NO(x) fresh emissions during the non-photochemical reaction period from 20:00 PM to 9:00 AM (local time). During the lockdown, compared to the same period in 2019, the daily average concentrations in the city decreased by 42.7% for PM(2.5), 47.9% for PM(10), 28.6% for SO(2), 22.3% for CO and 58.4% for NO(2), which is obviously explained by the absence of city activities. Overall, we observed not only the expected reduction in some atmospheric pollutants (PM, SO(2), CO, NO(2)), but also unexpected increases in SO(2) in the rural areas and of ozone (O(3)) in both urban and rural areas, the latter being paradoxically due to the reduction in nitrogen oxide levels. In other words, the city lockdown has improved air quality by reducing PM(2.5), PM(10), CO, and NO(2), but has also decreased air quality by augmenting O(3) and SO(2).

However, the implementation of good governance by the Singapore government itself is carried out by steps and decisions that will be taken and implemented through the digital bureaucracy to the community in order to suppress the positive number of COVID‐19. The application of good governance also needs support other crucial elements that improved by digital bureaucracy, which are transparency, accountability, efficiency and effective.","Abdou, Ahmed Mohammad",J Public Aff,https://doi.org/10.1002/pa.2656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230813/,557
651789,COVID-19: Shining the Light on Africa,2020-05-05,"BACKGROUND: A systemic coagulation dysfunction has been associated with COVID-19. In this case report, we describe a COVID-19-positive patient with multisite arterial thrombosis, presenting with acute limb ischaemia and concomitant ST-elevation myocardial infarction and oligo-symptomatic lung disease. CASE SUMMARY: An 83-year-old lady with history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease presented to the Emergency Department with acute-onset left leg pain, pulselessness, and partial loss of motor function. Acute limb ischaemia was diagnosed. At the same time, a routine ECG showed ST-segment elevation, diagnostic for inferior myocardial infarction. On admission, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2, as per hospital protocol during the current COVID-19 pandemic. A total-body CT angiography was performed to investigate the cause of acute limb ischaemia and to rule out aortic dissection; the examination showed a total occlusion of the left common iliac artery and a non-obstructive thrombosis of a subsegmental pulmonary artery branch in the right basal lobe. Lung CT scan confirmed a typical pattern of interstitial COVID-19 pneumonia. Coronary angiography showed a thrombotic occlusion of the proximal segment of the right coronary artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed, with manual thrombectomy, followed by deployment of two stents. The patient was subsequently transferred to the operating room, where a Fogarty thrombectomy was performed. The patient was then admitted to the COVID area of our hospital. Seven hours later, the swab returned positive for COVID-19. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 can have an atypical presentation with thrombosis at multiple sites.","Angelillis, Marco; De Carlo, Marco; Christou, Andrea; Marconi, Michele; Mocellin, Davide M; Caravelli, Paolo; De Caterina, Raffaele; Petronio, Anna S",Eur Heart J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33644636/,557
652071,Implementation of a COVID-19 Vaccination Condition of Employment in a Community Nursing Home,2021-08-07,"BACKGROUND: In Louisiana, deaths related to COVID-19 have disproportionately occurred in Black persons. Granular data are needed to better understand inequities and develop prevention strategies to mitigate further impact on Black communities. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of patients admitted to an urban safety-net hospital in New Orleans, LA with reactive SARS-CoV-2 testing from March 9-31, 2020. Clinical characteristics of Black and other racial/ethnic group patients were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher’s exact tests. The relationship between race and outcome was assessed using Day-14 status on an ordinal scale. RESULTS: This study included 249 patients. Median age was 59, 44% were male, 86% were age ≥65y or had ≥1comorbidity. Overall, 87% were Black, relative to 55% Black patients typically hospitalized at our center. Black patients had longer symptom duration at presentation (6.41 versus 5.88 days, p=0.05), and were more likely to have asthma (p=0.008), but less likely to have dementia (p=0.002). There were no racial differences in initial respiratory status or laboratory values except higher LDH in Black patients. Patient age and initial oxygen requirement, but not race (adjusted proportional odds ratio = 0.92, 95%CI: 0.70-1.20), were associated with worse Day-14 outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate minor racial differences in comorbidities or disease severity at presentation, and Day-14 outcomes were not different between groups. However, Black patients were disproportionately represented in hospitalizations, suggesting that prevention efforts should include strategies to limit SARS-CoV-2 exposures and transmission in Black communities as one step towards reducing COVID-19 related racial inequities.","Silver, Victoria; Chapple, Andrew G; Feibus, Allison H; Beckford, Jeremy; Halapin, Natalie A; Barua, Delphi; Gordon, Angellica; Baumgartner, Will; Vignes, Seth; Clark, Cullen; Kamboj, Sanjay; Lim, Stephen C; Mackey, Scott P; Seal, Paula S; Kanter, Joseph M; Bell, Caryn; Clement, Meredith E",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32884965/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa339,557

The emergence of variants of concern (VOC) that are more transmissible than the previous circulating ones has raised particular concerns on the vaccines effectiveness and reinfection rates. The P.1 lineage was first identified in December 2020 in Manaus city and is now globally spread. We report the first case of reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 caused by the P.1 variant outside of Manaus.

656237,Estimating the Maximum Capacity of COVID-19 Cases Manageable per Day Given a Health Care System's Constrained Resources,2020-04-16,"Introduction In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, governments have implemented social distancing measures to slow viral transmission. This work aims to determine the extent to which socioeconomic and political conditions have shaped community-level distancing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially how these dynamics have evolved over time. Methods This study used daily data on physical distancing based on 15‒17 million cell phone users in 3,037 U.S. counties. County-level changes in the average distance traveled per person were estimated relative to pre-pandemic weeks as a proxy for physical distancing. Pooled ordinary least squares regressions estimated the association between physical distancing and a variety of county-level demographic, socioeconomic, and political characteristics by week from March 9, 2020 through January 17, 2021. Data were collected until January 2021, at which point the analyses were finalized. Results Lower per capita income and greater Republican orientation were associated with significantly reduced physical distancing throughout nearly all of the study period. These associations persisted after adjusting for a variety of county-level demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Other county-level characteristics, such as the share of Black and Hispanic residents, were associated with reduced distancing at various points during the study period. Conclusions These results highlight the importance of dynamic socioeconomic and political gradients in preventive behavior and imply the need for nimble policy responses.","Kavanagh, Nolan M.; Goel, Rishi R.; Venkataramani, Atheendar S.",Am J Prev Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2021.01.040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33947527/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379721001690?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0749379721001690,557

Many therapies have been proven to be ineffective; however, promising findings related to corticosteroid therapy have been published. Analysis of published data including in this issue suggests that therapy with corticosteroids in the range of 6 mg of dexamethasone (or equivalent) per day likely has a positive effect in patients requiring mechanical ventilation but there remains considerable doubt in patients over the age of 70, in patients with diabetes and patients with milder disease.

659733,Searching for Human Connectedness During COVID-19,2020-08-10,"Following detection of the first few COVID-19 cases in early March, Bangladesh has stepped up its efforts to strengthen capacity of the healthcare system to avert a crisis in the event of a surge in the number of cases. This paper sheds light on the preparedness of the healthcare system by examining the spatial distribution of isolation beds across districts and divisions, forecasting the number of ICU units that may be required in the short term and analyzing the availability of frontline healthcare workers to combat the pandemic. As of April 18, COVID-19 cases have been found in 53 of the 64 districts in Bangladesh with Dhaka District being the epicenter. Seventy-five percent of the cases have been identified in 5 neighboring districts, namely, Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur, Narsingdi and Kishoreganj, which appear to form a spatial cluster. However, if one takes into account the population at risk, the prevalence appears to be highest in Narayanganj, followed by Dhaka, Gazipur, Narsingdi and Munshiganj. These regions may therefore be flagged as the COVID-19 hotspots in Bangladesh. Among the eight divisions, prevalence is highest in Dhaka Division followed by Mymensingh and Barishal. The number of cases per million exceeds the number of available isolation beds per million in the major hotspots indicating that there is a risk of the healthcare system becoming overwhelmed should the number of cases rise. This is especially true for Dhaka Division, where the ratio of COVID-19 patients to doctors appears to be alarmingly high. Mymensingh Division also has a disproportionately small number of doctors relative to the number of COVID-19 patients. Using second order polynomial regression, the analysis predicts that even if all ICU beds are allocated to COVID-19 patients, Bangladesh may run out of ICU beds soon after May 4, 2020. We conclude that in spite of a significant increase in hospital capacity during 2005-15 and a 57% rise in the number of doctors during the same period, the healthcare system in Bangladesh and Dhaka Division in particular, may not be fully prepared to handle the COVID-19 crisis. Thus, further steps need to be taken to flatten the curve and improve healthcare capacity.","Rahaman Khan, H.; Howlader, T.; Islam, M.

663890,India’s Battle against COVID-19: Progress and Challenges,2020-08-24,"BACKGROUND: Surgery is the cornerstone of gynecological cancer management, but inpatient treatment may expose both patients and healthcare staff to COVID-19 infections. Plans to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have been implemented widely, but few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of these plans in maintaining safe surgical care delivery. AIM: To evaluate the effects of mitigating plans implemented on the delivery of gynecological cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A comparative cohort study of patients treated in a high-volume tertiary gyneoncological centre in the United Kingdom. Prospectively-recorded consecutive operations performed and early peri-operative outcomes during the same calendar periods (January–August) in 2019 and 2020 were compared. RESULTS: In total, 585 operations were performed (296 in 2019; 289 in 2020). There was no significant difference in patient demographics. Types of surgery performed were different (p = 0.034), with fewer cytoreductive surgeries for ovarian cancer and laparoscopic procedures (p = 0.002) in 2020. There was no difference in intra-operative complication rates, critical care admission rates or length of stay. One patient had confirmed COVID-19 infection (0.4%). The 30-day post-operative complication rates were significantly higher in 2020 than in 2019 (58 [20.1%] versus 32 [10.8%]; p = 0.002) for both minor and major complications. This increase, primarily from March 2020 onwards, coincided with the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining surgical throughput with meticulous and timely planning is feasible during the COVID-19 pandemic but this was associated with an increase in post-operative complications due to a multitude of reasons.","Leung, Elaine; Pervaiz, Zahra; Lowe-Zinola, Jack; Cree, Sian; Kwong, Audrey; Marriott, Natalie; Cole, Florence; Arum, Uchechukwu; Szopinski, Barbara; Elattar, Ahmed; Sundar, Sudha; Kehoe, Sean; Singh, Kavita; Balega, Janos; Yap, Jason",Gynecol Oncol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0090825820342165; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2020.12.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33358197/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090825820342165,557

Virally encoded Coxsackievirus 3C protease (3C(pro)) plays an essential role in viral proliferation. Here, benserazide was discovered as a novel inhibitor from a drug library screen targeting Coxsackievirus 3C(pro) using a FRET-based enzyme assay. Benserazide, whose chemical structure has no electrophilic functional groups, was characterized as a non-competitive inhibitor by enzyme kinetic studies. A molecular docking study with benserazide and its analogs indicated that a novel putative allosteric binding site was involved. Specifically, a 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzyl moiety was determined to be a key pharmacophore for the enzyme’s inhibitory activity. We suggest that the putative allosteric binding site may be a novel target for future therapeutic strategies.","Kim, Bo-Kyoung; Cho, Joong-Heui; Jeong, Pyeonghwa; Lee, Youngjin; Lim, Jia Jia; Park, Kyoung Ryoung; Eom, Soo Hyun; Kim, Yong-Chul",FEBS Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26022398/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579315004214; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014579315004214; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2015.05.027,557
667328,A ‘good death’ during COVID-19: Outdoor terminal extubation facilitates safe family presence for a dying patient,2020-10-31,"The health profession faces a new challenge with the emergence of a novel viral disease Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a form of atypical pneumonia caused by a coronavirus termed SARS-CoV. This highly infectious disease has spread through 32 countries, infecting more than 8,400 patients with over 790 deaths in just over 6 months. Over one quarter of those infected were unsuspecting healthcare workers. The major transmission mode of SARS-coronavirus appears to be through droplet spread with other minor subsidiary modes of transmission such as close contact and fomites although air borne transmission has not been ruled out. There is as yet no definitive treatment protocol. Although the peak period of the outbreak is likely to have passed and the risk of SARS in the UK is therefore assessed to be low, the World Health Organisation has asked all countries to remain vigilant lest SARS re-emerges. Recent laboratory acquired cases of SARS reported from Taiwan and Beijing, China are a testimony to this risk. Until reliable diagnostic tests, vaccine and medications are available, control of SARS outbreaks depends on close surveillance, early identification of index cases, quick isolation of carriers and effective infection control and public health measures.","Li, R W K; Leung, K W C; Sun, F C S; Samaranayake, L P",Br Dent J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15272339/,557

We have previously shown that vaccines made of a polymeric glyco-adjuvant conjugated to an antigen were effective in triggering such a response in other disease models and hypothesized that the technology could be adapted to create an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The core of the vaccine platform is the copolymer p(Man-TLR7), composed of monomers with pendant mannose or a toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist. Thus, p(Man-TLR7) is designed to target relevant antigen-presenting cells (APCs) via mannose-binding receptors and then activate TLR7 upon endocytosis. The p(Man-TLR7) construct is amenable to conjugation to protein antigens such as the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, yielding Spike-p(Man-TLR7). Here, we demonstrate Spike-p(Man-TLR7) vaccination elicits robust antigen-specific cellular and humoral responses in mice. In adult and elderly wild-type mice, vaccination with Spike-p(Man-TLR7) generates high and long-lasting titers of anti-Spike IgGs, with neutralizing titers exceeding levels in convalescent human serum. Interestingly, adsorbing Spike-p(Man-TLR7) to the depot-forming adjuvant alum, amplified the broadly neutralizing humoral responses to levels matching those in mice vaccinated with formulations based off of clinically-approved adjuvants. Additionally, we observed an increase in germinal center B cells, antigen-specific antibody secreting cells, activated T follicular helper cells, and polyfunctional Th1-cytokine producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We conclude that Spike-p(Man-TLR7) is an attractive, next-generation subunit vaccine candidate, capable of inducing durable and robust antibody and T cell responses.","Gray, Laura T.; Raczy, Michal M.; Briquez, Priscilla S.; Marchell, Tiffany M.; Alpar, Aaron T.; Wallace, Rachel P.; Volpatti, Lisa R.; Sasso, Maria Stella; Cao, Shijie; Nguyen, Mindy; Mansurov, Aslan; Budina, Erica; Watkins, Elyse A.; Solanki, Ani; Mitrousis, Nikolaos; Reda, Joseph W.; Yu, Shann S.; Tremain, Andrew C.; Wang, Ruyi; Nicolaescu, Vlad; Furlong, Kevin; Dvorkin, Steve; Manicassamy, Balaji; Randall, Glenn; Wilson, D.

670645,Uptake and use of a minimum data set (MDS) for older people living and dying in care homes in England: a realist review protocol,2020-11-14,"BACKGROUND: Public health emergencies – such as the 2020 COVID19 pandemic –accelerate the need for both evidence generation and rapid dissemination and implementation (D&I) of evidence where it is most needed. In this paper, we reflect on how D&I frameworks and methods can be pragmatic (i.e., relevant to real-world context) tools for rapid and iterative planning, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of evidence to address public health emergencies. The Pragmatic, Rapid, and Iterative D&I (PRIDI) Cycle: The PRIDI Cycle is based on a “double-loop” learning process, reflecting the iterative and adaptive D&I, along with iterative re-consideration of goals and priorities, interventions and corresponding D&I strategies, and needs and capacities of individuals and contexts. Stakeholder engagement is essential- which itself is an evolving activity. The results of iterative evaluations should be communicated with local implementers and stakeholders through customized feedbacks. CONCLUSION: Even when the health system priority is provision of the best care to the individuals in need, and scientists are focused on development of effective diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, planning for D&I is critical. Without a flexible and adapting process of D&I, which is responsive to emerging evidence generation cycles, and is closely connected to stakeholders and target users through engagement and feedback, the interventions to mitigate public health emergencies – such as the COVID19 pandemic - will have limited reach and impact on populations that would most benefit. The PRIDI cycle is intended to provide a pragmatic approach to support planning for D&I throughout the evidence generation process.","Nooraie, Reza Yousefi; Shelton, Rachel C; Fiscella, Kevin; Kwan, Bethany M; McMahon, James M",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-188929/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594352/,557

This disease poses an extraordinary challenge for public health systems because screening and surveillance capacity is often severely limited, especially during the beginning of the outbreak; this can fuel the outbreak, as many patients can unknowingly infect other people. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to collect and analyze posts related to COVID-19 on Weibo, a popular Twitter-like social media site in China. To our knowledge, this infoveillance study employs the largest, most comprehensive, and most fine-grained social media data to date to predict COVID-19 case counts in mainland China. METHODS: We built a Weibo user pool of 250 million people, approximately half the entire monthly active Weibo user population. Using a comprehensive list of 167 keywords, we retrieved and analyzed around 15 million COVID-19–related posts from our user pool from November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020. We developed a machine learning classifier to identify “sick posts,” in which users report their own or other people’s symptoms and diagnoses related to COVID-19. Using officially reported case counts as the outcome, we then estimated the Granger causality of sick posts and other COVID-19 posts on daily case counts. For a subset of geotagged posts (3.10% of all retrieved posts), we also ran separate predictive models for Hubei province, the epicenter of the initial outbreak, and the rest of mainland China. RESULTS: We found that reports of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 significantly predicted daily case counts up to 14 days ahead of official statistics, whereas other COVID-19 posts did not have similar predictive power. For the subset of geotagged posts, we found that the predictive pattern held true for both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China regardless of the unequal distribution of health care resources and the outbreak timeline. CONCLUSIONS: Public social media data can be usefully harnessed to predict infection cases and inform timely responses. Researchers and disease control agencies should pay close attention to the social media infosphere regarding COVID-19. In addition to monitoring overall search and posting activities, leveraging machine learning approaches and theoretical understanding of information sharing behaviors is a promising approach to identify true disease signals and improve the effectiveness of infoveillance.","Shen, Cuihua; Chen, Anfan; Luo, Chen; Zhang, Jingwen; Feng, Bo; Liao, Wang",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/19421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32452804/,557

Online consultations have been shown to alleviate the pandemic with our study aims to demonstrate whether online consultation can be a solution for acute health crisis. Retrospective analysis of the characteristics of online consultations through two primary care online-consultation platforms during COVID-19 pandemic was performed at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, which led the assessment of COVID-19-symptoms patients in Guangzhou. The 3473 online consultations were divided into pre-pandemic and pandemic period groups with Chi-square test as statistical analysis method. The number of online consultations has increased with diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infection, psychological conditions, COVID-19-related investigations and interventions. The increased online consultations met the increased demand of the relevant clinical services and reduced the overwhelming hospital presentations, thus decreasing the potential COVID-19 spread inside the major tertiary hospital and sparing the resources for acute crisis management. The epidemiology and disease characteristics of online consultations during the pandemic have been demonstrated with identification of the enabling factors and potential barriers in improving online healthcare in China with online consultation model being a durable solution for pandemic in future.","Zhou, Fengli; Wang, Zhouhan; Mai, Xiaojun; Liu, Xiaoyun; Reid, Christopher; Sandover, Sally; Zhang, Kouxing; Xu, Dan",J Prim Care Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33213264/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2150132720975517,557
678176,Safer Surgical Practice: A Guide for Surgeons (not just for pandemics),2021-01-15,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, self-quarantining, wearing masks, and washing hands have become part of the new norm for many, but not all. It appears that such preventive measures are critical to “flattening the curve” of the spread of COVID-19. The public’s adoption of such behaviors is an essential component in the battle against what has been referred to as the “invisible enemy.” OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to develop a model for predicting COVID-19 preventive behaviors among US college students. The Health Belief Model has a long history of use and empirical support in predicting preventive health behaviors, but it is not without its purported shortcomings. This study identifies a more optimal and defensible combination of variables to explain preventive behaviors among college students. This segment of the US population is critical in helping slow the spread of COVID-19 because of the relative reluctance of college students to perform the needed behaviors given they do not feel susceptible to or fearful of COVID-19. METHODS: For this study, 415 US college students were surveyed via Qualtrics and asked to answer questions regarding their fear of COVID-19, information receptivity (seeking relevant information), perceived knowledge of the disease, self-efficacy, and performance of preventive behaviors. The PROCESS macro (Model 6) was used to test our conceptual model, including predictions involving sequential mediation. RESULTS: Sequential mediation results show that fear of COVID-19 leads individuals to seek out information regarding the disease, which increases their perceived knowledge and fosters self-efficacy; this is key to driving preventive behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Self-imposed preventive measures can drastically impact the rate of infection among populations. Based on this study’s newly created sequential mediation model, communication strategies for encouraging COVID-19 preventive behaviors are offered. It is clear that college students, and very possibly adults of all ages, must have a healthy fear of COVID-19 to set in motion a process where concerned individuals seek out COVID-19–related information, increasing their store of knowledge concerning the disease, their self-efficacy, and ultimately their likelihood of performing the needed preventive behaviors.","Roberts, James A; David, Meredith E",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33651707/; https://doi.org/10.2196/23218,557

Using peptide-HLA tetramers for direct ex vivo analysis, we characterized CD8+ T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in COVID-19 patients and unexposed individuals. Unlike CD8+ T cells directed towards subdominant epitopes – B7/N257, A2/S269 and A24/S1208 – CD8+ T cells specific for the immunodominant B7/N105 epitope were detected at high frequency in pre-pandemic samples, and at increased frequency during acute COVID-19 and convalescence. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells in pre-pandemic samples from children, adults and elderly individuals predominantly displayed a naïve phenotype, indicating a lack of previous cross-reactive exposures. T cell receptor (TCR) analyses revealed diverse TCRαβ repertoires and promiscuous αβ-TCR pairing within B7/N105 +CD8+ T cells.

Apart from the challenges related to collection or processing of this data, its efficient storage is also a significant challenge since this data do not conform to any predefined storage model. Therefore, any enterprise dealing with huge unstructured data requires a scalable storage system that can provide data durability and availability at a low cost. The paper proposes a tenant-centric approach to develop an object-based software defined storage system for SaaS multi-tenant applications. We present TOSDS (Tenant-centric Object-based Software Defined Storage), a system that can efficiently meet the storage requirements of users or tenants with diverse needs who are using a multitenant SaaS application.

However, there is no much literature available on pulmonary rehabilitation in pediatric patients’ post lung transplant. Through this case report, we would like to present our intensive PR program for pediatric patients’ post-lung transplant. PATIENT CONCERNS: The 10-year-old boy's breathing before receiving a lung transplant continued to deteriorate and he eventually became dependent on a wheelchair. DIAGNOSIS: He was diagnosed with infantile acute lymphoblastic leukemia at 6 months of age. At the age of one year, he underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, but was diagnosed with post-transplantation bronchiolitis obliterans (PTBO) two months later. He had a lung transplant at the age of 10. INTERVENTIONS: He was hospitalized and received an initial assessment. This assessment included functional, cognitive, and psychological evaluations. He additionally completed PR exercises twice daily for two weeks. After discharge, he continued to participate in an outpatient-based PR program for three months. During the outpatient phase, PR exercises were performed once weekly, in addition to home-based cognitive training. OUTCOMES: Our intensive post-lung PR program improved our patient's exercise capacity, lung function, and quality of life. As a comprehensive rehabilitation service, our program also included a cognitive training component. CONCLUSION: We describe an intensive PR program tailored to pediatric patients’ post-lung transplant. The program was feasible and resulted in improvements in functional exercise capacity, lung function, and quality of life. Future research into our method is necessary for continued improvement of this novel program.","Choi, Eun Jung; Kim, Won; Jeon, Jae Yong; Ko, Eun Jae; Yu, Jinho; Choi, Se Hoon; Lee, Seung Hak; Sung, In Young",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33907101/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000025523,557

Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly contagious respiratory pathogen of chickens that can affect the kidneys and reproductive systems resulting in bird mortality and decreased reproductivity. The interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are activated in response to viral infections and represent a class of cellular restriction factors that restrict the replication of many viral pathogens. Here, we characterize the relative mRNA expression of the chicken IFITM genes in response to IBV infection, in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro using the pathogenic M41-CK strain, the nephropathogenic QX strain and the nonpathogenic Beaudette strain. In vivo we demonstrate a significant upregulation of chIFITM1, 2, 3 and 5 in M41-CK- and QX-infected trachea two days post-infection. In vitro infection with Beaudette, M41-CK and QX results in a significant upregulation of chIFITM1, 2 and 3 at 24 h post-infection. We confirmed a differential innate response following infection with distinct IBV strains and believe that our data provide new insights into the possible role of chIFITMs in early IBV infection.","Steyn, Angela; Keep, Sarah; Bickerton, Erica; Fife, Mark",Genes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32785186/; https://doi.org/10.3390/genes11080918,557

Tocilizumab, an IL-6 antagonist has been used in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with conflicting results from different parts of the world. We conducted a retrospective descriptive study from Feb 2020 to May 2020 on COVID-19 patients with ARDS and hyperinflammation characterized by raised CRP and/or ferritin. A total of 244 patients with COVID-19 were admitted out of which 107 had ARDS. Thirty patients had both ARDS and hyperinflammation and received tocilizumab. The mean age was 62.5 years (SD: 13.5) and the majority were male (83%). The mean CRP pre-treatment was 217.5 mg/L and post 48 to 72 hours of tocilizumab treatment was 98.5 mg/L. Twenty-one patients (70%) also received concomitant intravenous methylprednisolone. Of the 30 patients, 7 died and 20 recovered.

Here we examined the distribution and densities of face masks on some of the main tourist beaches in Chile, and we monitored their daily accumulation rates on one beach in northern-central Chile. Face masks were found on beaches across the country with average densities of 0.006 ± 0.002 (mean ± se) face masks m-2, which are higher than densities reported on Peruvian beaches, but lower than those on some Kenyan beaches. Face masks were also found on more remote beaches and rocky shores in northern-central Chile. Daily accumulation rates on one tourist beach were low during austral fall/winter (0.2 face masks km-1 d-1), but were over ten times higher during austral summer (3.0 face masks km-1 d-1). These values are substantially higher than daily accumulation rates reported from urban streets, which is most likely due to the high densities of beach visitors during the summer tourist season. COVID-19 related infrastructure (signposts and PPE waste bins) was present on most beaches, but while signposts about personal protection were abundant, there were few signposts about littering, and only one of the 12 beaches sampled for COVID infrastructure had a signpost that offered recommendations about the proper disposal of used face masks. Specific waste bins for PPE waste were only available at three beaches. Based on these findings it is recommended to provide sufficient PPE-related signs and waste bins, establish general and strict waste disposal regulations, and to improve enforcement. Educational campaigns should aim at recommending proper use and disposal of face masks, litter prevention, reduction of single-use waste and enhanced pro-environmental behaviors.","Thiel, Martin; de Veer, Diamela; Espinoza-Fuenzalida, Nuxia L.; Espinoza, Camilo; Gallardo, Camila; Hinojosa, Ivan A.; Kiessling, Tim; Rojas, Javiera; Sanchez, Abril; Sotomayor, Fernanda; Vasquez, Nelson; Villablanca, Roberto",Sci Total Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721025572; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721025572?v=s5,557

Here, we report the single-cell transcriptional landscape of longitudinally collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in both COVID-19 and influenza A virus (IAV)-infected patients. We observed increase of plasma cells in both COVID-19 and IAV patients, and XAF1-, TNF- and FAS-induced T cell apoptosis in COVID-19 patients. Further analyses revealed distinct signaling pathways activated in COVID-19 (STAT1 and IRF3) vs. IAV (STAT3 and NFκB) patients and substantial differences in the expression of key factors. These factors include relatively increase of IL6R and IL6ST expression in COVID-19 patients, but similarly increased IL-6 concentrations compared to IAV patients, supporting the clinical observations of increased pro-inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients. Thus, we provide the landscape of PBMCs and unveil distinct immune response pathways in COVID-19 and IAV patients.","Zhu, Linnan; Yang, Penghui; Zhao, Yingze; Zhuang, Zhenkun; Wang, Zhifeng; Song, Rui; Zhang, Jie; Liu, Chuanyu; Gao, Qianqian; Xu, Qumiao; Wei, Xiaoyu; Sun, Hai-Xi; Ye, Beiwei; Wu, Yanan; Zhang, Ning; Lei, Guanglin; Yu, Linxiang; Yan, Jin; Diao, Guanghao; Meng, Fanping; Bai, Changqing; Mao, Panyong; Yu, Yeya; Wang, Mingyue; Yuan, Yue; Deng, Qiuting; Li, Ziyi; Huang, Yunting; Hu, Guohai; Liu, Yang; Wang, Xiaoqian; Xu, Ziqian; Liu, Peipei; Bi, Yuhai; Shi, Yi; Zhang, Shaogeng; Chen, Zhihai; Wang, Jian; Xu, Xun; Wu, Guizhen; Wang, Fusheng; Gao, George F.; Liu, Longqi; Liu, William J.",Immunity,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761320303162; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32783921/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2020.07.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761320303162?v=s5,557

Due to the pace of the pandemic, measures of pandemic-related disruption have not been subject to rigorous empirical validation. To address this gap, a multi-national sample (United Kingdom, 76%; United States, 19%; Canada, 4%, and Australia, 1%) of 372 female caregivers and 158 male caregivers of 5–18-year-old children was recruited online. Participants completed a survey including a 25-item scale indexing disruption in finances, basic needs, personal and family welfare, career/education, household responsibilities, and family relationships related to the pandemic. An exploratory factor analysis yielded an optimal three-factor solution: factors included Income Stress (five items related to income, debt, and job loss; loadings ranged from 0.57 to 0.91), Family Stress (seven items related to family altercations and child management; loadings from 0.57 to 0.87), and Chaos Stress (four items related to access to supplies, crowded shopping areas, news coverage; loadings from 0.53 to 0.70). Multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated measurement invariance of each factor across female and male caregivers, indicating that factor structure, loadings, and thresholds were equivalent across groups. Composites reflective of each factor were computed, and Mann-Whitney U tests indicated that female caregivers consistently scored higher than male caregivers on COVID-19 stressors related to income, family, and chaos. Finally, concurrent validity was demonstrated by significant bivariate correlations between each scale and caregiver, family, and child outcomes, respectively. This demonstrates the validity of the COVID-19 Family Stressor Scale for use with female and male caregivers in family-based research. The current sample was predominantly White-European, married/common-law, and had at least some post-secondary education.

It is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which emerged at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, quickly spreading worldwide. COVID-19 is a disease with symptoms that range from fever and breathing difficulty to acute respiratory distress and death, critically affecting older patients and people with previous comorbidities. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract, which it then uses to reach several organs. The immune system of infected patients has been demonstrated to suffer important alterations, such as lymphopenia, exhausted lymphocytes, excessive amounts of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages, especially in the lungs, and cytokine storms, which may contribute to its severity and difficulty of establishing an effective treatment. Even though no specific treatment is currently available, several studies have been investigating potential therapeutic strategies, including the use of previously approved drugs and immunotherapy.
