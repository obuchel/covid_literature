11587,Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Coronavirus Disease 2019 Interim Guidelines: A Consensus Document from an International Group of Interdisciplinary Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Providers,2020-05-12,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of subtype H5 are a major threat for poultry holdings worldwide, here especially the zoonotic Asian H5N1 viruses. These HPAIVs have caused more than 500 fatal spillover infections from poultry to humans, with a looming danger of a new pandemic by establishing human-to-human transmissions. Besides culling measures in infected farms in endemic areas, vaccination is the major tool against HPAIV. However, the mainly used inactivated preparations have several limitations, like application to the individual animal by injection and a reduced efficiency. Here we present a modified live influenza vaccine prototype, which is based on the H17N10 bat influenza virus. The new chimeric vaccine strain R65(mono)/H17N10 was able to provide full protection against a lethal challenge infection with HPAIV H5N1 of juvenile and subadult chickens, as well as ferrets after oronasal immunization. In addition, the H5 vaccine prototype cannot reassort with avian influenza viruses and therefore is a promising tool against HPAIV H5 infection, allowing new vaccination strategies for efficient disease control.","Schön, Jacob; Ran, Wei; Gorka, Marco; Schwemmle, Martin; Beer, Martin; Hoffmann, Donata",NPJ Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7229168/,619
45277,Determination of acute changes in new electrocardiography parameters during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support,2021-01-15,"PURPOSE: Geriatric trauma patients present physiological challenges to care providers. A nationwide analysis was performed to evaluate the roles of age alone versus age-associated comorbidities in the morbidity and mortality of elderly patients with blunt abdominal trauma (BAT). METHODS: Patients with BAT registered in the National Trauma Data Bank from 2013 to 2015 were analyzed using propensity score matching (PSM) to evaluate the mortality rate, complication rate, hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) LOS and ventilator days between young (age < 65) and elderly (age ≥ 65) patients. An adjusted multivariate logistic regression (MLR) model was also used to evaluate the effect of age itself and age-associated comorbidities on mortality. RESULTS: There were 41,880 patients with BAT during the study period. In elderly patients, the injury severity score (ISS) decreased with age, but the mortality rate increased inversely (from 5.0 to 13.5%). Under a similar condition and proportion of age-associated comorbidities after a well-batched PSM analysis, elderly patients had significantly higher mortality rates (8.0% vs. 1.9%, p < 0.001), higher complication rates (35.1% vs. 30.6%, p < 0.001), longer hospital LOS (8.9 vs. 8.1 days, p < 0.001), longer ICU LOS (3.7 vs. 2.7 days, p < 0.001) and more ventilator days (1.1 vs. 0.5 days, p < 0.001) than young patients. Furthermore, the MLR analysis showed that age itself served as an independent factor for mortality (odds ratio: 1.049, 95% CI 1.043–1.055, p < 0.001), but age-associated comorbidity was not. CONCLUSION: In patients with BAT, age itself appeared to have an independent and deleterious effect on mortality, but age-associated comorbidity did not.

61909,Increased Glucocorticoid Receptor Alpha Expression and Signaling in Critically Ill Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients.,2021-05-25,"OBJECTIVE To investigate audiometric outcomes and incidence of chronic ear disease following lateral skull base repair (LSBR) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective review. SETTING Tertiary skull base center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Consecutive adults undergoing LSBR of CSF leaks between 2012 and 2018 were reviewed. Audiometric data included mean air conduction pure-tone average (PTA), air-bone gap (ABG), speech recognition threshold (SRT), and word recognition score (WRS). The incidence and management of the following were collected: effusion, retraction, otitis media and externa, perforation, and cholesteatoma. RESULTS Seventy-three patients underwent transmastoid (n = 5), middle cranial fossa (n = 2), or combined approach (n = 67) for repair of spontaneous leaks (sCSFLs, n = 41) and those occurring in the setting of chronic ear disease (ceCSFLs, n = 32). ABG decreased 7.23 dB (P = .01) in sCSFL patients. Perforations (P = .01) were more likely in ceCSFL. No sCSFL patient developed a cholesteatoma, perforation, or infection. Effusions (n = 7) were transient, and retractions (n = 2) were managed conservatively in the sCSFL cohort. Eight ceCSFL patients required tubes, 3 underwent tympanoplasties with (n = 2) and without (n = 1) ossicular chain reconstruction (OCR), and 1 had tympanomastoidectomy with OCR. CONCLUSION Lateral skull base repair of CSF leaks maintained or improved hearing. Patients with preexisting chronic ear disease were more likely to require additional intervention to sustain adequate middle ear aeration compared to the sCSFL cohort. LSBR of sCSFL does not appear to increase risk for developing chronic ear disease.","Yancey, Kristen L; Manzoor, Nauman F; Haynes, David S; Bennett, Marc L; O'Malley, Matthew; Rivas, Alejandro",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820911720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32204657/,619
66964,Reply: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: A Concern.,2015,"Emerging infectious diseases increasingly threaten wildlife populations. Most studies focus on managing short-term epidemic properties, such as controlling early outbreaks. Predicting long-term endemic characteristics with limited retrospective data is more challenging. We used individual-based modeling informed by individual variation in pathogen load and transmissibility to predict long-term impacts of a lethal, transmissible cancer on Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) populations. For this, we employed approximate Bayesian computation to identify model scenarios that best matched known epidemiological and demographic system properties derived from 10 yr of data after disease emergence, enabling us to forecast future system dynamics. We show that the dramatic devil population declines observed thus far are likely attributable to transient dynamics (initial dynamics after disease emergence). Only 21% of matching scenarios led to devil extinction within 100 yr following devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) introduction, whereas DFTD faded out in 57% of simulations. In the remaining 22% of simulations, disease and host coexisted for at least 100 yr, usually with long-period oscillations. Our findings show that pathogen extirpation or host-pathogen coexistence are much more likely than the DFTD-induced devil extinction, with crucial management ramifications. Accounting for individual-level disease progression and the long-term outcome of devil-DFTD interactions at the population-level, our findings suggest that immediate management interventions are unlikely to be necessary to ensure the persistence of Tasmanian devil populations. This is because strong population declines of devils after disease emergence do not necessarily translate into long-term population declines at equilibria. Our modeling approach is widely applicable to other host-pathogen systems to predict disease impact beyond transient dynamics.","Wells, Konstans; Hamede, Rodrigo K; Jones, Menna E; Hohenlohe, Paul A; Storfer, Andrew; McCallum, Hamish I",Ecology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2613; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30636287/,619

In particular, this entity with reflux drainage directly into the ophthalmic vein is extremely rare. We report a case of ethmoidal dural AVF with direct drainage of the superior ophthalmic vein (SOV) and inferior ophthalmic vein (IOV), successfully treated by endovascular surgery. A 58-year-old man presented with progressive diplopia. Angiography and contrast-enhanced CT showed an ethmoidal dural AVF supplied via the bilateral anterior ethmoidal arteries and venous drainage through the left SOV and IOV. A transarterial approach through the bilateral anterior ethmoidal arteries was used to place the microcatheter close to the fistula site. After intra-arterial embolization with 20% N-butyl cyanoacrylate, the dural AVF was completely occluded. In patients with good vascular access, endovascular transarterial embolization may be an effective and less invasive treatment strategy for ethmoidal dural AVF.","Inoue, Akihiro; Tagawa, Masahiko; Kumon, Yoshiaki; Watanabe, Hideaki; Shoda, Daisuke; Sugiu, Kenji; Ohnishi, Takanori",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-011098.rep; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24682847/,619

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the validity and reliability of commercial wearables in measuring step count, heart rate, and energy expenditure. METHODS We identified devices to be included in the review. Database searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, and SPORTDiscus, and only articles published in the English language up to May 2019 were considered. Studies were excluded if they did not identify the device used and if they did not examine the validity or reliability of the device. Studies involving the general population and all special populations were included. We operationalized validity as criterion validity (as compared with other measures) and construct validity (degree to which the device is measuring what it claims). Reliability measures focused on intradevice and interdevice reliability. RESULTS We included 158 publications examining nine different commercial wearable device brands. Fitbit was by far the most studied brand. In laboratory-based settings, Fitbit, Apple Watch, and Samsung appeared to measure steps accurately. Heart rate measurement was more variable, with Apple Watch and Garmin being the most accurate and Fitbit tending toward underestimation. For energy expenditure, no brand was accurate. We also examined validity between devices within a specific brand. CONCLUSIONS Commercial wearable devices are accurate for measuring steps and heart rate in laboratory-based settings, but this varies by the manufacturer and device type. Devices are constantly being upgraded and redesigned to new models, suggesting the need for more current reviews and research.","Fuller, Daniel; Colwell, Emily; Low, Jonathan; Orychock, Kassia; Tobin, Melissa Ann; Simango, Bo; Buote, Richard; Van Heerden, Desiree; Luan, Hui; Cullen, Kimberley; Slade, Logan; Taylor, Nathan G A",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,https://doi.org/10.2196/18694; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32897239/,619

87504,[Anesthesia recovery comparison between remifentanil-propofol and remifentanil-desflurane guided by Bispectral Index® monitoring].,2017,"PURPOSE Women are underrepresented at scientific conferences, decreasing the visibility of female role models, which are vital for aspiring young female scientists. This investigation aimed to evaluate female representation at the German Society of Urology's (GSoU) annual meeting. METHODS The programs of the GSoU meeting of 2011, 2018, 2019 and the virtual conference in 2020 were retrospectively quantified by gender and categorized by chair or speaker, type, and topic of the session. Descriptive analysis was applied. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify gender inequity and variables influencing gender distribution. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS A total of 2.504 chairs and speakers were invited to the GSoU meeting in 2018 and 2019. Female speakers or chairs were represented in 17.8%, indicating a gender gap of 64.7%. There were significant differences between session type, topic, and gender distribution for chairs and speakers. The topic surgical techniques were independent variables for both, underrepresented female chairs and speakers, respectively (p < 0.001). Vocational policy and plenary session were not represented by any female chair in 2011, 2018, and 2019. In comparison, the gender gap in 2011 was 74.2%, indicating a gap reduction of 1.2% per year. In a selected virtual program in 2020, the gender gap increased to 70.4%. CONCLUSION There is still a significant discrepancy between gender representation at the GSoU annual meetings, and gender equity is currently not expected before 50 years. Future efforts should address the implementation of established guidelines for achieving gender equity at urological conferences.","Hüsch, Tanja; Haferkamp, Axel; Thomas, Christian; Steffens, Joachim; Fornara, Paolo; Kranz, Jennifer",World journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00345-021-03777-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34219179/,619
88310,Efficacy and safety of prophylactic use of ketamine for prevention of postanesthetic shivering: a systematic review and meta analysis.,2019-12-30,"OBJECTIVE To provide guidance on the management of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), a condition characterized by fever, inflammation, and multiorgan dysfunction that manifests late in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Task Force also provided recommendations for children with hyperinflammation during COVID-19, the acute, infectious phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS The Task Force was composed of 9 pediatric rheumatologists, 2 adult rheumatologists, 2 pediatric cardiologists, 2 pediatric infectious disease specialists, and 1 pediatric critical care physician. Preliminary statements addressing clinical questions related to MIS-C and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 were developed based on evidence reports. Consensus was built through a modified Delphi process that involved anonymous voting and discussion through webinars. A 9-point scale was used to determine the appropriateness of each statement (1-3, inappropriate; 4-6, uncertain; 7-9, appropriate), and consensus was rated as low (L), moderate (M), or high (H) based on dispersion of the votes along the numeric scale. Approved guidance statements had to be classified as appropriate with moderate or high levels of consensus, which were pre-specified prior to voting. RESULTS The first version of the guidance was approved by the Task Force in June 2020 and consisted of 40 final guidance statements accompanied by a flow diagram depicting the diagnostic pathway for MIS-C. The document was revised in November 2020, and a new flow diagram with recommendations for initial immunomodulatory treatment of MIS-C was added.

97543,Reasons for the Overuse of Sedatives and Deep Sedation for Mechanically Ventilated Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients.,2021-06-02,"INTRODUCTION In spite of the widespread implementation of preventive strategies, the prevalence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) remains high. HAIs are associated with multidrug resistant organisms, and in the post-antibiotic era, alternative strategies such as vaccines are needed for their management. AREAS COVERED Vaccines to prevent HAIs could be proposed to at-risk patients, or to healthcare workers (HCWs) to prevent cross-transmission. After searches in Pubmed and clinicaltrials.gov, existing vaccines and vaccines under clinical development are presented in this narrative review. Issues associated with the use of vaccines to prevent HAIs are discussed. EXPERT COMMENTARY Future vaccines against HAIs will contribute to fight antibiotic resistance and thus reduce the burden of HAIs. At this stage, the goal of obtaining effective vaccines against S.aureus, C. difficile and gram-negative bacteria has not yet been achieved. Obtaining an efficient response to vaccines in at-risk patients for HAIs is also challenging, and future strategies of vaccination need to address this difficulty. The efficacy of vaccines for HCWs in reducing the spread of nosocomial outbreaks is counterbalanced by the lack of adherence to vaccine policies among HCWs. The acceptance of future vaccines to prevent carriage and infection with organisms involved in HAIs in HCWs will probably be a challenge.","Gagneux-Brunon, Amandine; Lucht, Frédéric; Launay, Odile; Berthelot, Philippe; Botelho-Nevers, Elisabeth",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2018.1470507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29697286/,619
102375,Judging Futility of Resuscitation Attempts for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients Requires Better Time Data.,2021-04-01,"Background: The VOYAGER PAD trial demonstrated superiority of rivaroxaban plus aspirin versus aspirin to reduce major cardiac and ischemic limb events following lower extremity revascularization (LER). Clopidogrel is commonly used as a short-term adjunct to aspirin after endovascular revascularization, whether clopidogrel modifies the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban has not been described. Methods: VOYAGER PAD was a phase 3, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in symptomatic PAD patients undergoing LER randomized to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus 100 mg aspirin daily or rivaroxaban placebo plus aspirin. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of acute limb ischemia, major amputation of a vascular cause, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke or cardiovascular death. The principal safety endpoint was TIMI major bleeding with ISTH major bleeding a secondary safety outcome. Clopidogrel use was allowed at the discretion of the investigator for up to six months following the qualifying revascularization. Results: 3313 (50.6%) of the randomized patients received clopidogrel, median duration of 29.0 days. Over 3-years the hazard ratio (HR) for the primary outcome of rivaroxaban versus placebo was 0.85 (95% CI 0.71-1.01) with clopidogrel and 0.86 (95% CI 0.73-1.01) without, without statistical heterogeneity (p-interaction =0.92). Rivaroxaban resulted in an early apparent reduction in acute limb ischemia (ALI) within 30 days, HR 0.45 (95%CI 0.14-1.46) with and HR 0.48 (95% CI 0.22-1.01) without clopidogrel (p-interaction = 0.93). Compared with aspirin, rivaroxaban increased TIMI major bleeding similarly regardless of clopidogrel use (p-interaction 0.71). With clopidogrel use >30 days, rivaroxaban was associated with more ISTH major bleeding within 365 days (HR 3.20, 95% CI 1.44-7.13) compared with shorter durations of clopidogrel (p-trend 0.06). Conclusions: In the VOYAGER PAD trial, rivaroxaban plus aspirin reduced the risk of adverse cardiovascular and limb events with an early benefit for ALI regardless of clopidogrel use. The safety of rivaroxaban was consistent regardless of clopidogrel use, but with a trend for more ISTH major bleeding with clopidogrel use > 30 days than a shorter duration. These data support the addition of rivaroxaban to aspirin after LER regardless of concomitant clopidogrel with a short (course ≤ 30 days) associated with less bleeding.

104197,Failed videolaryngoscope intubation in a patient with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and spinal cord injury.,2010,"Virus-laden droplets dispersion may induce transmissions of respiratory infectious diseases. Existing research mainly focuses on indoor droplet dispersion, but the mechanism of its dispersion and exposure in outdoor environment is unclear. By conducting CFD simulations, this paper investigates the evaporation and transport of solid-liquid droplets in an open outdoor environment. Droplet initial sizes (dp = 10 μm, 50 μm, 100 μm), background relative humidity (RH = 35%, 95%), background wind speed (Uref = 3 m/s, 0.2 m/s) and social distances between two people (D = 0.5 m, 1 m, 1.5 m, 3 m, 5 m) are investigated. Results show that thermal body plume is destroyed when the background wind speed is 3 m/s (Froude number Fr ~ 10). The inhalation fraction (IF) of susceptible person decreases exponentially when the social distance (D) increases from 0.5 m to 5 m. The exponential decay rate of inhalation fraction (b) ranges between 0.93 and 1.06 (IF=IF0e-b(D-0.5)) determined by the droplet initial diameter and relative humidity. Under weak background wind (Uref = 0.2 m/s, Fr ~ 0.01), the upward thermal body plume significantly influences droplet dispersion, which is similar with that in indoor space. Droplets in the initial sizes of 10 μm and 50 μm disperse upwards while most of 100 μm droplets fall down to the ground due to larger gravity force. Interestingly, the deposition fraction on susceptible person is ten times higher at Uref = 3 m/s than that at Uref = 0.2 m/s. Thus, a high outdoor wind speed does not necessarily lead to a smaller exposure risk if the susceptible person locating at the downwind region of the infected person, and people in outdoors are suggested to not only keep distance of greater than 1.5 m from each other but also stand with considerable angles from the prevailing wind direction.","Yang, Xia; Yang, Hongyu; Ou, Cuiyun; Luo, Zhiwen; Hang, Jian",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33582331/,619

112812,Response: tracheostomy associated complications with veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.,2020-06-23,"BACKGROUND Previous research has shown that the use of the bispectral index (BIS) monitor to measure the depth of anaesthesia reduces the amount of anaesthetics administered and the recovery time from general anaesthesia. The effect of BIS on recovery from anaesthesia and consumption of anaesthetics in a paediatric population receiving total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil has not been studied. METHODS A single-blind, single-centre clinical trial. One hundred fifty-seven patients were enrolled. They were scheduled for ear, nose, and throat surgery and stratified according to age groups (1-3 years, 4-11 years, 12-17 years, 18-65 years) and type of operation, yielding a total of nine subgroups. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either a TIVA with propofol and remifentanil according to conventional clinical practice (control) or guided by BIS. Normalised propofol (μg/kg/min) and remifentanil (μg/kg/min) consumption and time to extubation (s) were the outcome measures. RESULTS Children aged 1-3 years in the BIS group had a longer time to extubation compared with controls (P: 0.04). Patients aged 12-17 years in the BIS group received higher maintenance infusion rates of propofol compared with controls (P = 0.02). No significant difference for the outcome variables was evidenced in the other age groups. CONCLUSION BIS monitoring for guidance of propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia does not result in reduced consumption of anaesthetics and does not reduce time to extubation in adult and children compared with conventional practice.","Bresil, P; Nielsson, M S; Malver, L P; Kraemer, K; Schjørring, O; Dethlefsen, C; Lambert, P H",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.12158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23855759/,619

116376,"Racial Differences in a Detroit, MI, ICU Population of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients.",2020-12-18,"Food allergen and aeroallergen sensitization are common allergic diseases worldwide, with widely varying estimates of prevalence in children. Our study investigated the characteristics of ingestion and inhalation allergy among children from Sichuan province in Southwest China, so as to get public awareness of these disorders.A total of 1722 children between 0 and 14 years' old were enrolled in this study. They were outpatients in the West China Second University Hospital during June 2019 to September 2019. Serum specific IgE specific to 10 types of food allergen and 10 types of aeroallergen were estimated. Nutrition indicators were tested by electrochemical luminescence.59.70% children were allergic to at least 1 allergen, comprising 24.90% to aeroallergen and 38.81% to food allergen, respectively, whereas 36.28% children were allergic to both aeroallergen and food allergen. Milk was the most common food allergen, and egg came in second place. With regard to aeroallergen, house dust mite held the maximum proportion (65.02%), whereas dust mite followed behind. Inhalation allergy was more commonly seen in boys than girls. Bronchitis was the most common symptom of both allergies. In addition, the highest incidence age for children to be sensitive to food allergen and aeroallergen were 0∼2 years' old and 3∼5 years' old, respectively. It is worth mentioning that there was no significant difference in nutritional status between children with or without allergic diseases.Our findings reveal that milk, egg, house dust mite, and dust mite are the most common allergens among children in Sichuan province. Boys are more susceptible to aeroallergen than girls. Furthermore, the prevalence of ingestion and inhalation allergy varies from different age groups, and has no correlation with nutritional status. In brief, the analysis of the pattern of food allergen and aeroallergen sensitization is invaluable to effective diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases.","Liu, Ting; Lai, Shu-Yu; Li, Wen-Sheng; Jiang, Yong-Mei",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000021055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629732/,619

ACE2 connects the classical arm renin-angiotensin system, consisting mainly of angiotensin II peptide and its AT1 receptor, with a protective arm, consisting mainly of the angiotensin 1-7 peptide and its Mas receptor. In this brief article, we have reviewed the literature to describe how ACE2 is a key protective arm enzyme in the function of many organs, particularly in the context of brain and cardiovascular function, as well as in renal, pulmonary and digestive homeostasis. We also very briefly review and refer to recent literature to present an insight into the role of ACE2 in determining the course of coronavirus diseases 2019.","Pagliaro, Pasquale; Thairi, Cecilia; Alloatti, Giuseppe; Penna, Claudia",Journal of cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.2459/jcm.0000000000001218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34091532/,619

Forced emergence to find an effective vaccine to immunize people has led scientists to design and examine vaccine candidates all over the world. Until a vaccine is developed, however, effective treatment is needed to combat this virus, which is resistant to all conventional antiviral drugs. Accordingly, more about the structure, entry mechanism, and pathogenesis of COVID-19 is required. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the gateway to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, so our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 can help us to complete its mechanism of interaction with ACE2 and virus endocytosis, which can be interrupted by neutralizing small molecules or proteins. ACE2 also plays a crucial role in lung injury.","Ziai, Seyed Ali; Rezaei, Mitrasadat; Fakhri, Sajad; Pouriran, Ramin",Journal of cellular physiology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.30041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901940/,619
133364,ICU Bed Utilization During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in a Multistate Analysis-March to June 2020.,2021-03-01,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is among the most important tools for the evaluation of gastrointestinal tumors and affected areas around the gastrointestinal tract. It enables the acquisition of material from abnormal lesions via the gastrointestinal wall for tissue confirmation via endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). EUS-FNA has played a vital role in oncological care and has become the standard method for tissue sampling. The choice of needle type is an important factor determining tissue acquisition and has been evaluated by many researchers. New needles are introduced into the market almost every year, and opinions vary regarding proper needle selection. While there are diverse opinions but no definitive recommendations about the use of one particular device, fine-needle biopsy needles may provide detailed information on a tissue's architecture based on greater sample yields. This permits additional analyses, including genetic sequencing and phenotyping, thereby enabling the provision of more personalized treatment plans. Furthermore, other EUS-guided procedures have been developed, including interventional EUS and through-the-needle devices. Given the continued attempts to improve the diagnostic ability and therapeutic techniques, we review in detail the available types of puncture needles to provide guidance on the selection of the appropriate needle types.","Fujita, Akashi; Ryozawa, Shomei; Tanisaka, Yuki; Ogawa, Tomoya; Suzuki, Masahiro; Noguchi, Tatsuya; Katsuda, Hiromune; Mizuide, Masafumi",Diagnostics,https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics10070463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32650628/,619
136854,A Simple Approach for Gas Blender on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Resource Shortage Context.,2020,"A total of 482 veal cutlet, 555 ground veal, and 540 ground beef samples were purchased from retail establishments in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. over a non-contiguous, two-year period between 2014 and 2017. Samples (325 g each) were individually enriched and screened via real-time PCR for all seven regulated serogroups of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). Presumptive STEC positive samples were subjected to serogroup-specific immunomagnetic separation and plated onto selective media. Up to five isolates typical for STEC from each sample were analyzed via multiplex PCR for both the virulence genes (i.e., eae , stx 1 and/or stx 2 , and ehxA ) and serogroup-specific gene(s) for the seven regulated STEC serogroups. The recovery rates of non-O157 STEC from veal cutlets (3.94%, 19 of 482 samples) and ground veal (7.03%, 39 of 555 samples) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that from ground beef (0.93%, 5 of 540 samples). In contrast, only a single isolate of STEC O157:H7 was recovered; this isolate originated from one (0.18%) of 555 samples of ground veal. Recovery rates for STEC were not associated with state, season, packaging type, or store type (P > 0.05), but were associated with brand and fat content (P < 0.05). Pulsed-field subtyping of the 270 viable/confirmed STEC isolates from the 64 total samples testing positive revealed 78 pulsotypes (50 to 80% similarity) belonging to 39 pulsogroups, with ≥90% similarity among pulsotypes within pulsogroups. Also, multiple isolates from the same sample displayed an indistinguishable pulsotype for 43 of 64 (67.7%) samples testing positive. These findings support related data from regulatory sampling exercises over the past decade and confirm that recovery rates for the regulated STEC serogroups are appreciably higher for raw veal compared to raw beef samples as was also observed herein for meat purchased at food retailers in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S.","Jung, YangJin; Porto-Fett, Anna C S; Parveen, Salina; Meredith, Joan; Shoyer, Bradley A; Henry, Elizabeth; Trauger, Zachary; Shane, Laura E; Osoria, Manuela; Schwarz, Jurgen; Rupert, Christopher; Chapman, Benjamin J; Moxley, Rodney A; Luchansky, John B",Journal of food protection,https://doi.org/10.4315/jfp-20-290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977344/,619

In this essay, 2 family physicians on different continents reflect on the meaning of touch in clinical practice and how virtual care is transforming this tacit aspect of patient care. Although technology enables physicians to stay in touch with patients verbally, we have lost the ability to physically touch. Traditionally, touch is central to medical practice, physical examination guides diagnosis and informs management. But the silent language of touch fulfills a deeper symbolic function, enabling physicians to acknowledge patient concerns in a tangible way. Touch expresses healing, extending beyond skin-to-skin contact to express humanity, caring, and connection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A preliminary study was performed using one pig to determine optimal ablation parameters. For the main experiment, four pigs were assigned to different groups according to heparinization use and biopsy needle caliber. In each pig, 14 control (without tract ablation) and 14 experimental (tract ablation) ultrasound-guided core biopsies were performed using either an 18- or 16-gauge needle. Post-biopsy bleeding amounts were measured by soaking up the blood for five minutes. The results were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS The optimal parameters for biopsy tract ablation were determined as a 2-cm active tip electrode set at 40-watt with a tip temperature of 70-80℃. The bleeding amounts in all experimental groups were smaller than those in the controls; however they were significant in the non-heparinized pig biopsied with an 18-gauge needle and in two heparinized pigs (p < 0.001). In the heparinized pigs, the mean blood loss in the experimental group was 3.5% and 13.5% of the controls biopsied with an 18- and 16-gauge needle, respectively. CONCLUSION Radiofrequency ablation of hepatic core biopsy tract ablation may reduce post-biopsy bleeding even under bleeding tendency and using a larger core needle, according to the result from in vivo porcine model experiments.","Lim, Sanghyeok; Rhim, Hyunchul; Lee, Min Woo; Song, Kyoung Doo; Kang, Tae Wook; Kim, Young-Sun; Lim, Hyo Keun",Korean journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2017.18.1.173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28096727/,619

Such changes however do not sufficiently account for circumstances of hardship, or black-swan events such as Covid-19, whereby the relative losers of trading arrangements should continue to receive outcomes which are not only efficient, but also fair and resilient. We argue that the ‘Society-in-the-Loop’ (SITL) social contract paradigm, in conjunction with the use of Strategic Responsible Innovation Management (StRIM), can together provide a solution for improving distributive justice in trade. Through collaboration with a locally based trade facilitation company, we describe the innovation-planning phase of a blockchain smart contract solution based on Derek Leben's idea of a ‘Rawlsian Algorithm’ (2017). It is demonstrated how this can be used to strengthen the algorithmic fairness of commercial contract implementation in accordance with existing ISO 20022 standards. Since currently no formal design framework exists for modeling blockchain oriented software (BOS), an agile development approach is adopted which takes account of the substantial difference between traditional software development and smart contracts. This method involves the construction of UML Use Case, Sequence, and Class diagrams, with a view to blockchain specificities.

To address this gap, we build on Knight's and Shackle's seminal ideas about how strategists address the incomplete knowledge problems that uncertainty poses. We argue that strategists adopt two distinct strategic postures when crafting strategies in uncertain markets-shaping and adapting-and theorize their constituent elements: intentions, epistemologies, and enactment strategies. Our framework extends current understanding of strategy under uncertainty by integrating research on adapting strategies, based on scientific epistemologies, which guide continuous experimentation and learning, with research on shaping strategies, based on design epistemologies, which guide significant symbolic and resource investments intended to create new market orders.

The aim is to help novice educators develop a better understanding of those barriers and prepare more student-centered course plans for their active online classes. Towards this end, we adopt a qualitative research approach and study information from different sources: social media content, interviews, and surveys from students and expert educators. Through a thematic analysis, we craft a nuanced list of students' online active learning barriers within the themes of human-side, technological, and environmental barriers. Each barrier is explored from the three aspects of frequency, importance, and exclusiveness to active online classes. Finally, we conduct a summative study with 12 novice educators and explain the benefits of using our barrier list for course planning in active online classes.","Mogavi, Reza Hadi; Zhao, Yankun; Haq, Ehsan Ul; Hui, Pan; Ma, Xiaojuan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04862v1.pdf,619

Despite this unique capability, TPL has experienced limited industrial adoption due to its low throughput. The recently developed parallel projection technique, called femtosecond projection TPL (FP-TPL), is a promising approach to scale up this process as it increases the throughput up to three orders of magnitude. However, it requires tuning of process parameters, including photopolymer material properties, to minimize over-polymerization-based defects. Here, we show how a modification of the optical projection strategy can be used to control these over-polymerization defects without tuning the photopolymer composition. Through optical modeling of the projection technique, we show that these defects can be minimized by altering the density of the projected mask. In addition, the aspect ratio of the submicron features can by reduced from more than 2 to 1.2. Thus, this optimal projection strategy transforms FP-TPL into a more robust process suitable for high-throughput high-quality 3D printing of micro and nanoscale structures.","Kim, Harnjoo; Saha, Sourabh K.",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920316097; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920316097,619

MethodsWe collected data from most popular social medias: Sina Weibo, Baidu search engine, and Ali e-commerce marketplace, from 1 Dec 2019 to 15 Feb 2020. Weibo post counts and Baidu searches were used to generate indices assessing public attention. Public intention and actual adoption of recommended protection measures or panic buying triggered by rumours and misinformation were measured by Baidu and Ali indices. Qualitative Weibo posts were analysed by the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count text analysis programme to assess public emotion responses to epidemiological events, governments announcements, and control measures. FindingsWe identified two missed windows of opportunity for early epidemic control of the COVID-19 outbreak, one in Dec 2019 and the other between 31 Dec and 19 Jan, when public attention was very low despite the emerging outbreak. Delayed release of information ignited negative public emotions. The public responded quickly to government announcements and adopted recommended behaviours according to issued guidelines. We found rumours and misinformation regarding remedies and cures led to panic buying during the outbreak, and timely clarification of rumours effectively reduced irrational behaviour. InterpretationSocial media surveillance can enable timely assessments of public reaction to risk communication and epidemic control measures, and the immediate clarification of rumours. This should be fully incorporated into epidemic preparedness and response systems.

This diversity, while a strength, can also foster divergent views about priorities and what constitutes success, thereby posing challenges for management, operations, and evaluation. As a sponsor and partner in such collaborations, we seek to assist and support their development and implementation of sound research strategies, to optimize their efficiency, sustainability, and public health impact. This report describes our efforts using an adaptation of the well-established Kaplan-Norton strategy management paradigm, in our clinical trials setting. We share findings from our first test of the utility and acceptance of this approach for evaluating and managing research strategies in a collaborative clinical research partnership. Results Findings from pilot studies and our first implementation in an ongoing clinical research partnership in Liberia, provide initial support for our hypothesis that an adapted version of the Kaplan-Norton strategy management model can have use in this setting. With leadership from within the partnership, analysis artifacts were gathered, and assessments made using standardized tools. Practical feasibility, resonance of the findings with partners, and convergence with other empirical assessments lend initial support for the view that this approach holds promise for obtaining meaningful, useable results for assessing and improving clinical research management. Conclusions and Implications Engaged leadership, thoughtful timing to align with partnership planning cycles, support for the process, and an eye towards the collaboration's long-term goals appear important for developing model understanding and practice. Skepticism about evaluations, and unease at exposing weaknesses, may hinder the effort. Acceptance of findings and associated opportunities for improvement by group leadership, support a growing sense of validity. Next steps aim to test the approach in other partnerships, streamline the methodology for greater ease of use, and seek possible correlations of strategy management assessments with performance evaluation. There is hardly a better example than the COVID-19 pandemic, to spotlight the need for efficient and effective clinical research partnerships to address global health challenges. While heartened by the collaborative spirit driving the effort so far, we cannot let our enthusiasm lull us into thinking that nobility of purpose or an abundance of good will is sufficient. Careful monitoring and adjustment of clinical research strategy in response to changes (e.g., demographics, pathogen evolution, research acceptance, political and cultural environments) are vital to making the needed adjustments that can guide these programs toward successful outcomes. We hope that our work can raise awareness about the importance, relevance, and feasibility of sound strategy management in clinical research partnerships, especially during this time when there is so much at stake.","Kagan, Jonathan Lassa Jerome Zuckerman Judith Cull Ellen Boan David Lysander Julia Njoh Wissedi Johnson Kumblytee Sardana Ratna Stern Kaytee Grace Beth McNay Laura Tegli Jemee",Contemporary Clinical Trials Communications,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conctc.2021.100833,619

Several aspects of stem cell maintenance are dependent from the functionality and fine tuning of the Notch pathway. In cancer, Notch is specifically involved in preserving self-renewal and amplification of cancer stem cells, supporting the formation, spread and recurrence of the tumor. As the function of Notch signaling is context dependent, we here provide an overview of its activity in a variety of tumors, focusing mostly on its role in the maintenance of the undifferentiated subset of cancer cells. Finally, we analyze the potential of molecules of the Notch pathway as diagnostic and therapeutic tools against the various cancers.","Meisel, Christian T; Porcheri, Cristina; Mitsiadis, Thimios A",,,619

Empowering patients and their care partners, including family members or friends involved in their care, may help minimize the burden and consequences of CKD-related symptoms to enable life participation. There is a need to broaden the focus on living well with kidney disease and re-engagement in life, including an emphasis on patients being in control. The World Kidney Day (WKD) Joint Steering Committee has declared 2021 the year of ""Living Well with Kidney Disease"" to increase education and awareness on the important goal of patient empowerment and life participation. This calls for the development and implementation of validated patient-reported outcome measures to assess and address areas of life participation in routine care. It could be supported by regulatory agencies as a metric for quality care or to support labelling claims for medicines and devices. Funding agencies could establish targeted calls for research that address the priorities of patients. Patients with kidney disease and their care partners should feel supported to live well through concerted efforts by kidney care communities including during pandemics. In the overall wellness program for kidney disease patients, the need for prevention should be reiterated. Early detection with a prolonged course of wellness despite kidney disease, after effective secondary and tertiary prevention programs, should be promoted. WKD 2021 continues to call for increased awareness of the importance of preventive measures throughout populations, professionals, and policy-makers, applicable to both developed and developing countries.","Kalantar-Zadeh, Kamyar; Li, Philip Kam-Tao; Tantisattamo, Ekamol; Kumaraswami, Latha; Liakopoulos, Vassilios; Lui, Siu-Fai; Ulasi, Ifeoma; Andreoli, Sharon; Balducci, Alessandro; Dupuis, Sophie; Harris, Tess; Hradsky, Anne; Knight, Richard; Kumar, Sajay; Ng, Maggie; Poidevin, Alice; Saadi, Gamal; Tong, Allison",Clin. exp. nephrol,,619

RECENT FINDINGS: Artificial intelligence algorithms harness the wealth of patient data to assist in diagnosing, staging, treating, and monitoring genitourinary malignancies. Successful applications of artificial intelligence in urologic oncology include interpreting diagnostic imaging, pathology, and genomic annotations. Many of these algorithms, however, lack external validity and can only provide predictions based on one type of dataset. SUMMARY: Future applications of artificial intelligence will need to incorporate several forms of data in order to truly make headway in urologic oncology.

The former is a modification of the black hole entropy due to quantum-gravitational effects that deform the black-hole horizon by giving it an intricate, fractal structure. We extract modified cosmological equations which contain new extra terms that constitute an effective dark-energy sector, and which coincide with the usual Friedmann equations in the case where the new Barrow exponent acquires its Bekenstein-Hawking value. We present analytical expressions for the evolution of the effective dark energy density parameter, and we show that the universe undergoes through the usual matter and dark-energy epochs. Additionally, the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter is affected by the value of the Barrow deformation exponent and it can lie in the quintessence or phantom regime, or experience the phantom-divide crossing. Finally, at asymptotically large times the universe always results in the de-Sitter solution.","Saridakis, Emmanuel N.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01105v2.pdf,619
224043,Adult ICU Triage During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: Who Will Live and Who Will Die? Recommendations to Improve Survival,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted health-care systems, leading to concerns about its subsequent impact on non-COVID disease conditions. The diagnosis and management of cancer is time sensitive and is likely to be substantially affected by these disruptions. We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care in India. METHODS: We did an ambidirectional cohort study at 41 cancer centres across India that were members of the National Cancer Grid of India to compare provision of oncology services between March 1 and May 31, 2020, with the same time period in 2019. We collected data on new patient registrations, number of patients visiting outpatient clinics, hospital admissions, day care admissions for chemotherapy, minor and major surgeries, patients accessing radiotherapy, diagnostic tests done (pathology reports, CT scans, MRI scans), and palliative care referrals. We also obtained estimates from participating centres on cancer screening, research, and educational activities (teaching of postgraduate students and trainees). We calculated proportional reductions in the provision of oncology services in 2020, compared with 2019. FINDINGS: Between March 1 and May 31, 2020, the number of new patients registered decreased from 112 270 to 51 760 (54% reduction), patients who had follow-up visits decreased from 634 745 to 340 984 (46% reduction), hospital admissions decreased from 88 801 to 56 885 (36% reduction), outpatient chemotherapy decreased from 173634 to 109 107 (37% reduction), the number of major surgeries decreased from 17 120 to 8677 (49% reduction), minor surgeries from 18 004 to 8630 (52% reduction), patients accessing radiotherapy from 51 142 to 39 365 (23% reduction), pathological diagnostic tests from 398 373 to 246 616 (38% reduction), number of radiological diagnostic tests from 93 449 to 53 560 (43% reduction), and palliative care referrals from 19 474 to 13 890 (29% reduction). These reductions were even more marked between April and May, 2020. Cancer screening was stopped completely or was functioning at less than 25% of usual capacity at more than 70% of centres during these months. Reductions in the provision of oncology services were higher for centres in tier 1 cities (larger cities) than tier 2 and 3 cities (smaller cities). INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had considerable impact on the delivery of oncology services in India. The long-term impact of cessation of cancer screening and delayed hospital visits on cancer stage migration and outcomes are likely to be substantial. FUNDING: None.

In spite of the higher virus load, induction of many cytokines and chemokines in the brains of infected Ifit2-/- mice were similar to that in wild-type mice. In contrast, infected Ifit2-/- mice revealed significantly impaired microglial activation as well as reduced recruitment of NK1.1 T cells and CD4 T cells to the brain, possibly contributing to the lack of viral clearance. These two deficiencies were associated with a lower level of microglial expression of CX3CR1, the receptor of the CX3CL1 (Fractalkine) chemokine, which plays a critical role in both microglial activation and leukocyte recruitment.

The numbers of registrations are now raising inordinately. It is challenging to understand which research areas are explored in this massive pool of clinical studies. If such information can be compiled, then it is easy to explore new research studies for possible contributions in COVID-19 research. METHODS: In the present work, a text-mining technique of artificial intelligence is utilized to map the research domains explored through the clinical trials of COVID-19. With the help of open-source and graphical user interface-based tool, 3007 clinical trials are analyzed here. The dataset is acquired from the international clinical trial registry platform of WHO. With the help of hierarchical cluster analysis, the clinical trials were grouped according to their common research studies. These clusters are analyzed manually using their word clouds for understanding the scientific area of a particular cluster. The scientific fields of clinical studies are comprehensively reviewed and discussed based on this analysis. RESULTS: More than three-thousand clinical trial are grouped in 212 clusters by hierarchical cluster analysis. Manual intervention of these clusters using their individual word-cloud, helped to identify various scientific areas which are explored in COVID19 related clinical studies. CONCLUSION: The text-mining is an easy and fastest way to explore many registered clinical trials. In our study, thirteen major clusters or research areas were identified in which the majority of clinical trials were registered. Many other uncategorized clinical studies were also identified as 'miscellaneousstudies'. The clinical trials within the individual cluster were studied, and their research purposes are compiled comprehensively in the present work.","Patel, Swayamprakash; Patel, Ashish; Patel, Mruduka; Shah, Umang; Patel, Mehul; Solanki, Nilay; Patel, Suchita",Reviews on recent clinical trials (Online),,619

In this study, the anxiety and hopelessness levels of healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers and the factors affecting them were evaluated in Turkey. Beck Hopelessness Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was applied online to participants. Totally 2156 individuals were included in the study and 52.0% (n:1121) of them are healthcare workers. The hopelessness and state anxiety levels of healthcare workers were higher than non-healthcare workers. Nurses' hopelessness levels are higher than doctors, and state anxiety levels are higher than both doctors and other healthcare workers. Anxiety and hopelessness levels were higher in women, those living with a high-risk individual at home during the pandemic, those who had difficulty in caring for their children, and those whose income decreased. Anxiety levels are an important predictor of hopelessness. The increase in anxiety levels explained 28.9% of the increase in hopelessness levels. Increased working hours is one of the important factors affecting anxiety. As a conclusion, healthcare workers were more affected psychologically in the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the society. Nurses were affected more than other healthcare workers. It is important to identify the factors affecting anxiety, hopelessness, and individuals who may be more psychologically affected during the pandemic.

METHODS: Pools of three whole-blood-derived human plasma units (630-650 ml) were inoculated with a clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Spiked units were treated with amotosalen/UVA light (INTERCEPT Blood System&#8482;) to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Infectious titres and genomic viral load were assessed by plaque assay and real-time quantitative PCR. Inactivated samples were subject to three successive passages on permissive tissue culture to exclude the presence of replication-competent viral particles. RESULTS: Inactivation of infectious viral particles in spiked plasma units below the limit of detection was achieved by amotosalen/UVA light treatment with a mean log reduction of >3·32 ± 0·2. Passaging of inactivated samples on permissive tissue showed no viral replication even after 9 days of incubation and three passages, confirming complete inactivation. The treatment also inhibited NAT detection by nucleic acid modification with a mean log reduction of 2·92 ± 0·87 PFU genomic equivalents. CONCLUSION: Amotosalen/UVA light treatment of SARS-CoV-2 spiked human plasma units efficiently and completely inactivated >3·32 ± 0·2 log of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, showing that such treatment could minimize the risk of transfusion-related SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Azhar, Esam I; Hindawi, Salwa I; El-Kafrawy, Sherif A; Hassan, Ahmed M; Tolah, Ahmed M; Alandijany, Thamir A; Bajrai, Leena H; Damanhouri, Ghazi A",Vox sang,,619

Methods: a descriptive and documentary study, carried out in April 2020. The terms were extracted from official documents of the Ministry of Health. The data were treated through terminological analysis, that is, the terms were organized through a classification system, which, in this research, was represented by the Seven Axis Model, version 2019. Also in the delimitation of the thematic field of the terminological analysis, the method of cross-mapping was chosen so that the terms resulting from the normalization process, derived from the literature, were cross-referenced with the terms of the International Classification for Nursing Practice in its seven axes. Results: after the normalization process, 472 useful terms were found. These were submitted to cross-mapping, totaling 263 constant terms and 211 non-constant terms. Conclusion: the study allowed identifying terms in the literature, which can be used by nurses in the care of people affected by COVID-19 and will support the stages following the construction of a terminological subset for information and communication to the Nursing practice.","Menezes, Harlon França de; Lima, Fillipe Rangel; Camacho, Alessandra Conceição Leite Funchal; Dantas, Janmilli da Costa; Ferreira, Lucas Batista; Silva, Richardson Augusto Rosendo da",Texto &amp; contexto enferm,,619

METHODS: During December 1, 2020-January 22, 2021, SARS-CoV-2-infected index cases and their close contacts in schools were identified by school and public health officials. For in-school contacts, we assessed symptoms and offered SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing; performed epidemiologic investigations and whole-genome sequencing to identify in-school transmission; and calculated secondary attack rate (SAR) by school setting (e.g., sports, elementary school classroom), index case role (i.e., staff, student), and index case symptomatic status. RESULTS: We identified 86 index cases and 1,119 contacts, 688 (63.1%) of whom received testing. Fifty-nine (8.7%) of 679 contacts tested positive; 15 (17.4%) of 86 index cases resulted in &#8805;2 positive contacts. Among 55 persons testing positive with available symptom data, 31 (56.4%) were asymptomatic. Highest SAR were in indoor, high-contact sports settings (23.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.7, 33.3), staff meetings/lunches (18.2%, CI 4.5-31.8), and elementary school classrooms (9.5%, CI 6.5-12.5). SAR was higher for staff (13.1%, CI 9.0-17.2) versus student index cases (5.8%, CI 3.6-8.0) and for symptomatic (10.9%, CI 8.1-13.9) versus asymptomatic index cases (3.0%, CI 1.0-5.5). CONCLUSIONS: Indoor sports may pose a risk to the safe operation of in-person learning. Preventing infection in staff members, through measures that include COVID-19 vaccination, is critical to reducing in-school transmission. Because many positive contacts were asymptomatic, contact tracing should be paired with testing, regardless of symptoms.","Gettings, Jenna R; Gold, Jeremy A W; Kimball, Anne; Forsberg, Kaitlin; Scott, Colleen; Uehara, Anna; Tong, Suxiang; Hast, Marisa; Swanson, Megan R; Morris, Elana; Oraka, Emeka; Almendares, Olivia; Thomas, Ebony S; Mehari, Lemlem; McCloud, Jazmyn; Roberts, Gurleen; Crosby, Deanna; Balajee, Abirami; Burnett, Eleanor; Chancey, Rebecca J; Cook, Peter; Donadel, Morgane; Espinosa, Catherine; Evans, Mary E; Fleming-Dutra, Katherine E; Forero, Catalina; Kukielka, Esther A; Li, Yan; Marcet, Paula L; Mitruka, Kiren; Nakayama, Jasmine Y; Nakazawa, Yoshinori; O039,; Hegarty, Michelle; Pratt, Caroline; Rice, Marion E; Rodriguez Stewart, Roxana M; Sabogal, Raquel; Sanchez, Emanny; Velasco-Villa, Andres; Weng, Mark K; Zhang, Jing; Rivera, Grant; Parrott, Tonia; Franklin, Rachel; Memark, Janet; Drenzek, Cherie; Hall, Aron J; Kirking, Hannah L; Tate, Jacqueline E; Vallabhaneni, Snigdha",Clin. infect. dis,,619

Sixty-six COVID-19(+) patients with high Hb A1c and 46 with average Hb A1c and 30 COVID-19(-) patients with average Hb A1c were included. Hb A1c levels and parameters examined in COVID-19(+) patients were compared between groups, and correlation analysis was performed between these parameters and Hb A1c levels. The effect of Hb A1c levels on intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality rate in COVID-19 patients was analyzed with the &#967;2 test. It was observed that hemoglobin (Hb) and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) levels of the COVID-19 (+) groups was lower than the COVID-19 (-) group, while ferritin, D-dimer, procalcitonin (PCT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were higher. The COVID-19 (+) group with high Hb A1c had higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), PCT and D-dimer levels than the other two groups, while Hb, partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) levels were lower. The Hb A1c levels of the COVID-19 (+) groups were positively correlated with absolute neutrophil count (ANC), LDH, PCT and (K+) levels, while negatively correlated with Hb and PaO2 levels. Hb A1c was found to be associated with the inflammation process, coagulation disorders and low PaO2 in COVID-19 patients. The COVID-19 patients with high Hb A1c levels had a higher mortality rate than other COVID-19 patients. Using Hb A1c measurements with other prognostic markers would contribute to the patient's risk of death assessment.","Unluguzel Ustun, Goksenin; Keskin, Adem; Aci, Recai; Arslanbek Erdem, Mukadder; Ari, Murat",Hemoglobin,,619

It is important to acknowledge that the containment of the outbreak cannot be effectively accomplished or sustained without the active support and engagement of the members of the community. Thus, it becomes extremely crucial to assess the behavioral change in the community, which will eventually determine the rate of transmission. In order to assess all these dimensions, a behavioral tool has been developed in the European region and it is anticipated that the obtained information can help the local and national stakeholders to coordinate their interventions and strategies for mounting a better public health response against the infection. In conclusion, in order to ensure that the public health response to COVID-19 pandemic are relevant and actionable, there is an indispensable need to understand the behavioral insights of the members of the community.

This is a single-center, retrospective, observational study conducted at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA. The inclusion criteria were: patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19 who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for INCA. Patients were labeled as COVID-19 positive based On a laboratory-confirmed positive polymerase chain reaction test. Patients with do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders, those who were made comfort care, or enrolled in hospice were excluded. The study was approved by the hospital's institutional review board. A total of 155 patients with COVID-19 infection were admitted;145/155 (93.5%) admitted to the medical floor and 10/155 (6.5%) to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). 36/145 (24.8%) floor patients were upgraded to MICU.

287425,Tocilizumab: Trick or treat in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019?,2021,"It is common to use networks to encode the architecture of interactions between entities in complex systems in the physical, biological, social, and information sciences. Moreover, to study the large-scale behavior of complex systems, it is important to study mesoscale structures in networks as building blocks that influence such behavior. In this paper, we present a new approach for describing low-rank mesoscale structure in networks, and we illustrate our approach using several synthetic network models and empirical friendship, collaboration, and protein--protein interaction (PPI) networks. We find that these networks possess a relatively small number of `latent motifs' that together can successfully approximate most subnetworks at a fixed mesoscale. We use an algorithm that we call""network dictionary learning""(NDL), which combines a network sampling method and nonnegative matrix factorization, to learn the latent motifs of a given network. The ability to encode a network using a set of latent motifs has a wide range of applications to network-analysis tasks, such as comparison, denoising, and edge inference. Additionally, using our new network denoising and reconstruction (NDR) algorithm, we demonstrate how to denoise a corrupted network by using only the latent motifs that one learns directly from the corrupted networks.","Lyu, Hanbaek; Kureh, Yacoub H.; Vendrow, Joshua; Porter, Mason A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06984v2.pdf,619

We then use this model to study the effect of the disruptions presented by Covid-19 on the U.S. economy. We construct a weighted digraph G = (V,E,W) using the industry-by-industry total requirements table for 2018, provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). We impose an initial shock that disrupts the production capacity of one or more industries, and we calculate the propagation of production shortages with a modified Cobb-Douglas production function. For the Covid-19 case, we model the initial shock based on the loss of labor between March and April 2020 as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The industries within the network are assigned a resilience that determines the ability of an industry to absorb input losses, such that if the rate of input loss exceeds the resilience, the industry fails, and its outputs go to zero. We observed a critical resilience, such that, below this critical value, the network experienced a catastrophic cascade resulting in total network collapse.

304205,Stratifying Deterioration Risk by Acuity at Admission Offers Triage Insights for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients,2021,"Accumulating evidence suggests that there are important contributions to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from redox imbalance and improperly coordinated iron, which cause cellular oxidative damage and stress. Cells have developed elaborate redox-dependent processes to handle and store iron, and their disfunction leads to several serious diseases. Cellular reductants are important as reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers and to power enzymatic repair mechanisms, but they also may help generate toxic ROS. These complicated interrelationships are presented in terms of a cellular redox/iron/ROS triad, including ROS generation both at improperly coordinated iron and enzymatically, ROS interconvertibility, cellular signaling and damage, and reductant and iron chelator concentration-dependent effects. This perspective provides the rational necessary to strongly suggest that COVID-19 disrupts this interdependent triad, producing a substantial contribution to the ROS load, which causes direct ROS-induced protein and phospholipid damage, taxes cellular resources and repair mechanisms, and alters cellular signaling, especially in the more critical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) phase of the infection.

The most relevant associated factors were: working in Guayas (the most affected province) (OR = 2.18 for depressive symptoms and OR = 2.59 for PTSD symptoms); being a postgraduate doctor (OR = 1.52 for depressive symptoms and OR = 1.57 for insomnia), perception of not having the proper protective equipment (OR = 1.71 for symptoms of depression and OR = 1.57 for symptoms of anxiety) and being a woman (OR = 1.39 for anxiety). CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals can suffer a significant mental condition that may require psychiatric and psychological intervention. The main associated factors are primarily related to living and working in cities with a higher number of cases and the characteristics of the job, such as being a postgraduate doctor, as well as the perception of security. The main risk factors are primarily related to geographical distribution and job characteristics, such as being a resident physician and self-perception of safety. Further studies are required as the pandemic evolves.","Pazmiño Erazo, Edgar Efraín; Alvear Velásquez, María José; Saltos Chávez, Ivonne Gisselle; Pazmiño Pullas, David Emanuel",Rev. colomb. psiquiatr,,619

The results showed that P. galeiformis reduced the disease incidence and lesion diameters without direct contact with the pathogen Penicillium digitatum. Transcriptome analysis revealed that phenylpropanoid biosynthesis was triggered by P. galeiformis. Genes encoding phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were upregulated, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase (4CL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), peroxidase (POD), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), O-methyltransferase, and hydroxyl cinnamoyl transferase. Moreover, P. galeiformis increased the activity of PAL, 4CL, C4H, POD, polyphenol oxidase, and CAD in citrus pericarp. In addition, P. galeiformis treated citrus displayed higher levels of total phenolic compounds, flavonoid, and lignin and higher amounts of ferulic and sinapic acid. In conclusion, these results suggested that P. galeiformis could induce resistance through modulating the pathway of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in postharvest citrus.","Chen, Ou; Deng, Lili; Ruan, Changqing; Yi, Lanhua; Zeng, Kaifang",J. agric.

328101,Reasons for the Overuse of Sedatives and Deep Sedation for Mechanically Ventilated Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients,2021,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate sub-health status (SHS) of people living in China during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection-induced acute infectious disease, which is featured by universal susceptibility and strong infectivity, and SHS (a status of low quality health) refers to a status of low-quality health. COVID-19 has gradually developed into a global pandemic, making the public in a high stress situation in physiological, psychological and social states in the short term. METHODS: From March 6 to 11, 2020, a large-scale cross-sectional survey was conducted by convenient sampling, and SHS assessment scale was used in the questionnaire. The ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors affecting SHS. RESULTS: In this study, 17,078 questionnaires were delivered with 16,820 effective questionnaires collected, and 10,715 subjects (63.7%) were found with SHS, with moderate SHS primarily. Physiological sub-scale scored the highest, followed by psychological and social sub-scales. Ordinal logistic regression analysis indicated that man, only-child, workers and farmers were risk factors of SHS. Protective factors of SHS included living in rural areas and townships, laid-off retirees and education degree. CONCLUSION: It shows many people in China place in a poor health status during COVID-19 pandemic. It is necessary that relevant departments pay more attention to people with poor health such as men, only-child, urban people, workers and farmers, and groups with high education degree during and after pandemic stabilization.","Pan, Yanbin; Yan, Jianlong; Lu, Wanxian; Shan, Miaohang",J Korean Acad Nurs,,619

Along with this, an analysis of psychiatric hospitalizations in Lombardy revealed a reduction in voluntary admissions in the 40 days after the beginning of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. Nevertheless, several studies reported a greater prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the Italian general population during the lockdown compared to before the pandemic. Furthermore, the request for psychological support by the Italian population appeared to be high during lockdown. Indeed, the Italian Ministry of Health declared that more than 50,000 calls to the telephone number for psychological support activated by the Ministry of Health and the Civil Protection because of the pandemic, with peaks during the lockdown. In addition, looking at Google Trends, the greatest searching activity for ""psychological support"" in recent years was detected the week of the 26th April 2020, followed by the week of the 22nd March 2020. We think that stronger indicators of mental health status and psychological well-being should be found to understand the long-term effects of the pandemic. The necessity of research for population-level and universal strategies is urgent, through repurposing, developing, and testing interventions to create evidence-based action plans for the entire population. Lastly, it is also essential to keep offering a psychological support suitable for all as done in past months to help individuals who have fewer opportunities to access care.","Gualano, Maria Rosaria; Lo Moro, Giuseppina; Voglino, Gianluca; Bert, Fabrizio; Siliquini, Roberta",Soc. psychiatr. psychiatr. epidemiol,,619

METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we reviewed the charts of all patients who had a visit at a medical retina referral center during the Italian quarantine (from 9th of March 2020 to 3rd of May 2020). Number and characteristics of these data were compared with data from the same period in 2019 (from 9th of March 2019 to 3rd of May 2019). RESULTS: In the 2019 study period, there were 303 patients attending clinic (150 males, 153 females). In the 2020 study period, patients decreased to 75 (48 males, 27 females; P = 0.022 comparing gender prevalence between the two periods) with an overall reduction of 75.2%. Mean ± SD age was 71.4 ± 14.3 years (range 25-93 years) in the 2019 study period and 66.7 ± 13.1 years (range 32-91 years) in the 2020 study period (P = 0.005). The largest drop in outpatient volume was recorded in AMD patients (- 79.9%). Regarding the intravitreal treatments, there were 1252 injections in the 2019 period and 583 injections in the 2020 period (- 53.6% in injections). The drop in intravitreal treatments was larger in patients with posterior uveitis, retinal vein occlusion, and diabetes (- 85.7%, - 61.9%, and - 59.6%, respectively). CONCLUSION: The volume of outpatient visits and intravitreal injections declined during the COVID-19 quarantine. The short- and long-term impacts are that routine in-person visits and intravitreal injections are expected to increase after the quarantine and, even more, after the pandemic.","Borrelli, Enrico; Grosso, Domenico; Vella, Giovanna; Sacconi, Riccardo; Querques, Lea; Zucchiatti, Ilaria; Prascina, Francesco; Bandello, Francesco; Querques, Giuseppe",Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,,619
332802,Clinical Outcomes Following Tocilizumab Administration in Mechanically Ventilated Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cardiac presentations and the possible influencing factors of severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted. Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 admitted to the Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou from January 21st to February 24th 2020 were enrolled. According to the clinical classification, the patients were divided into severe group and critical group. The myocardial injury markers, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), myoglobin (MYO), MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK-MB), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 55 COVID-19 patients were selected, including 15 critical cases and 40 severe cases. The patients with severe and critical COVID-19 were male-dominated (61.8%), the average age was (61.2±13.0) years old, 83.6% (46 cases) of them had contact history of Hubei, 38.2% (21 cases) of them were complicated with hypertension. There was no significant difference in baseline data between the critical group and the severe group. Myocardial injury markers of critical and severe COVID-19 patients were increased in different proportion, LDH increased in most patients (20 severe cases and 7 critical cases), followed by AST (16 severe cases and 5 critical cases). There was significant difference in the number of patients with elevated CK between severe group and critical group (cases: 1 vs. 4, P = 0.027). Abnormal ECG was found in 39 of 42 patients with ECG examination. Nonspecific change of T wave was the most common. Before and after treatment, 9 of 15 patients with changes of ECG and myocardial injury markers had oxygenation index less than 100 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), and the prominent changes of ECG were heart rate increasing and ST-T change. CONCLUSIONS: The increase of myocardial injury markers and abnormal ECG were not specific to the myocardial injury of severe and critical COVID-19 patients. At the same time, the dynamic changes of myocardial injury markers and ECG could reflect the situation of myocardial damage.","Tong, Yuwei; Xie, Zhiwei; Li, Yueping; Lyu, Mingfang; Deng, Xilong; Zhang, Fuchun; Lei, Chunliang",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,,619

We isolated a large number of nAbs from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals capable of disrupting proper interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) protein and the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). However, the structural basis for their potent neutralizing activity remains unclear. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the ten most potent nAbs in their native full-length IgG-form or in both IgG-form and Fab-form bound to the trimeric S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The bivalent binding of the full-length IgG is found to associate with more RBDs in the ""up"" conformation than the monovalent binding of Fab, perhaps contributing to the enhanced neutralizing activity of IgG and triggering more shedding of the S1 subunit from the S protein. Comparison of a large number of nAbs identified common and unique structural features associated with their potent neutralizing activities. This work provides a structural basis for further understanding the mechanism of nAbs, especially through revealing the bivalent binding and its correlation with more potent neutralization and the shedding of S1 subunit.","Yan, Renhong; Wang, Ruoke; Ju, Bin; Yu, Jinfang; Zhang, Yuanyuan; Liu, Nan; Wang, Jia; Zhang, Qi; Chen, Peng; Zhou, Bing; Li, Yaning; Shen, Yaping; Zhang, Shuyuan; Tian, Long; Guo, Yingying; Xia, Lu; Zhong, Xinyue; Cheng, Lin; Ge, Xiangyang; Zhao, Juanjuan; Wang, Hong-Wei; Wang, Xinquan; Zhang, Zheng; Zhang, Linqi; Zhou, Qiang",Cell Res,,619

These elements contain non-base-paired regions that potentially harbor ligand-binding pockets. Here, we performed an NMR-based screening of a poised fragment library of 768 compounds for binding to these RNAs, employing three different 1 H-based 1D NMR binding assays. The screening identified common as well as RNA-element specific hits. The results allow selection of the most promising of the 15 RNA elements as putative drug targets.

359697,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Surgical Practice in the Southeastern United States: Results of a Survey of the Membership of the Southeastern Surgical Congress,2020,"Several studies have focused on neonatal maternal separation (MS) to investigate behavioural and neuroendocrine reactions to lack of contact, but only a few have focused on early separation in the first days or weeks after birth. This literature review investigates the vital importance of contact and touch by exploring how skin-to-skin contact (SSC) regulates stress in the mother-infant relationship. Various databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect were searched for literature published between 2015 and 2020. From 1141 articles, 22 were declared eligible. The reviewed articles showed how SSC regulates child stress by biological indicators such as the autonomic nervous system (ANS), heart rate variability (HRV), cortisol, and oxytocin. This research concludes the importance of SSC for stress regulation, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. With no research to date indicating a possible risk of neonatal COVID-19 transmission following SSC, SSC should continue to be practiced for all women, as recommended by the WHO.","Ionio, Chiara; Ciuffo, Giulia; Landoni, Marta",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,619
362259,Online health survey on epileptic children during coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: While our knowledge about COVID-19 in adults has rapidly increased, data on the course of disease and outcome in children with different comorbidities is still limited. METHODS: Prospective, observational study at a tertiary care children's hospital in southern Germany. Clinical and virology data from all paediatric patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection at our hospital were prospectively assessed. RESULTS: Between March and November 2020, 14 patients were admitted with COVID-19. One patient was admitted a second time with COVID-19 6 months after initial disease. Among seven patients with severe underlying comorbidities, three developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), two were admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit. One patient needed invasive ventilation. Another patient died shortly after discharge of COVID-19-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: While COVID-19 generally causes mild disease in children, severe respiratory illness and MIS-C occur, in some cases with fatal outcome. Children with underlying diseases might be at special risk for severe disease.","Remppis, Jonathan; Ganzenmueller, Tina; Kohns Vasconcelos, Malte; Heinzel, Oliver; Handgretinger, Rupert; Renk, Hanna",BMC Infect Dis,,619

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted problems in evaluating the epidemiological scope of the disease using classical surveillance approaches, due to a lack of diagnostic capacity, and their application to only a small proportion of the population. As in previous pandemics, statistics, particularly the proportion of the population infected, are believed to be widely underestimated. Furthermore, analysis of only clinical samples cannot predict outbreaks in a timely manner or easily capture asymptomatic carriers. Threfore, community-scale surveillance, including wastewater-based epidemiology, can bridge the broader community and the clinic, becoming a valuable indirect epidemiological prediction tool for SARS-CoV-2 and other pandemic viruses. This article summarizes current knowledge and discusses the critical factors for implementing wastewater-based epidemiology of COVID-19.","Polo, David; Quintela-Baluja, Marcos; Corbishley, Alexander; Jones, Davey L; Singer, Andrew C; Graham, David W; Romalde, Jesús L",Water Res,,619
367712,Standard Sedation and Sedation With Isoflurane in Mechanically Ventilated Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"Currently, the COVID-19 outbreak is spreading fast in 185 countries and has engaged most people around the world. COVID-19 imposes severe and tragic consequences on people's health due to the high rate of spread and potentially fatal impacts. In this study, the association of socio-economic factors with food security and dietary diversity is assessed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from 299 respondents were collected by an online standard questionnaire. Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) and Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) were calculated. A multinomial regression model was applied to determine factors associated with HDDS and HFIAS before and during COVID-19 outbreak. Food security of Iranian households improved during the initial COVID-19 pandemic period (P < 0.001). Households reduced consumption of some food groups during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Key socio-economic factors associated with food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic included personal savings, household income, employment status of head of household, and nutrition knowledge of head of household. During the COVID-19 outbreak, household size, head of household's occupation, personal savings, and number of male children were significantly associated with dietary diversity. Distributing free food baskets to poor households, extending e-marketing, providing nutrition consultations, and organizing donations to support infected households may increase household dietary diversity and improve food security status during a pandemic such as COVID-19. Vulnerable populations in countries experiencing food insecurity, such as Iran, should be supported - not just by providing medical care and personal protective equipment, but also with flexible safety nets and food-based intervention programs to respond to population needs.","Pakravan-Charvadeh, Mohammad Reza; Mohammadi-Nasrabadi, Fatemeh; Gholamrezai, Saeed; Vatanparast, Hassan; Flora, Cornelia; Nabavi-Pelesaraei, Ashkan",J Clean Prod,,619

369203,Caring for Critically Ill Adults With Coronavirus Disease 2019 in a PICU: Recommendations by Dual Trained Intensivists,2020,"Purpose: Using the constructal law of physics this study aims to provide guidance to future scholarship on global supply chain management. Further, through two case studies the authors are developing, the authors report interview findings with two senior VPs from two multi-national corporations being disrupted by COVID-19. This study suggests how this and recent events will impact on the design of future global supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply the constructal law to explain the recent disruptions to the global supply chain orthodoxy. Two interviews are presented from case studies the authors are developing in the USA and UK – one a multi-national automobile parts supplier and the other is a earth-moving equipment manufacture. Specifically, this is an exploratory pathway work trying to make sense of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on supply chain scholarship. Findings: Adopting the approach of Bejan, the authors believe that what is happening today with COVID-19 and other trade disruptions such as Brexit and the USA imposing tariffs is creating new obstacles that will redirect the future flow of supply chains. Research limitations/implications: It is clear that the COVID-19 response introduced a bullwhip effect in the manufacturing sector on a scale never-before seen. For scholars, the authors would suggest there are four pathway topics going forward. These topics include: the future state of global sourcing, the unique nature of a combined “demand” and “supply shortage” bullwhip effect, the resurrection of lean and local production systems and the development of risk-recovery contingency strategies to deal with pandemics. Practical implications: Supply chain managers tend to be iterative and focused on making small and subtle changes to their current system and way of thinking, very often seeking to optimize cost or negotiate better contracts with suppliers. In the current environment, however, such activities have proved to be of little consequence compared to the massive forces of economic disruption of the past three years. Organizations that have more tightly compressed supply chains are enjoying a significant benefit during the COVID-19 crisis and are no longer being held hostage to governments of another country. Social implications: An implicit assumption in the press is that COVID-19 caught everyone by surprise, and that executives foolishly ignored the risks of outsourcing to China and are now paying the price. However, noted scholars and epidemiologists have been warning of the threats of pandemics since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. The pundits would further posit that in their pursuit of low-cost production, global corporations made naive assumptions that nothing could disrupt them. Both the firms the authors have interviewed had to close plants to protect their workforce. It was indicated in the cases the authors are developing that it is going to take manufacturers on average one month to recover from 4–6 days of disruption. These companies employ many thousands of people, and direct and ancillary workers are now temporarily laid off and face an uncertain future as/when they will recover back to normal production. Originality/value: Using the constructal law of physics, the authors seek to provide guidance to future scholarship on global supply chain management. Further, through two case studies, the authors provide the first insight from two senior VPs from two leading multi-national corporations in their respective sectors being disrupted by COVID-19. This study is the first indication to how this and recent disruptive events will impact on the design of future global supply chains. Unlike the generic work, which has recently appeared in HBR and Forbes, it is grounded in real operational insight.","Handfield, Robert B.; Graham, Gary; Burns, Laird",Int. J. Oper. Prod.

376145,The Lived Experience of ICU Clinicians During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak: A Qualitative Study,2021,"With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, a new coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), aroused the attention of the entire world. The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Two other coronavirus infections-SARS in 2002-2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012-both caused severe respiratory syndrome in humans. All 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a global spread are caused by ß-coronaviruses. Although coronaviruses usually infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is common. Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products. Because more and more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 cases, considerations of blood safety and coronaviruses have arisen especially in endemic areas. In this review, we detail current evidence and understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 through blood products as of February 10, 2020, and also discuss pathogen inactivation methods on coronaviruses.","Chang, Le; Yan, Ying; Wang, Lunan",Transfus Med Rev,,619

Serology testing allows for the detection of asymptomatic infections and 19-COVID cases once the virus has been cleared. We analyzed the usefulness of the SARS-CoV-2 rapid test of Autobio and tried to correlate its pattern with the severity of COVID19 infection. METHODS: We analyzed the accuracy and clinical usefulness of a point-of-care IgM and/or IgG test for SARS-CoV-2 in 35 COVID-19 patients [12 (34.3%) mild-moderate and 23 (65.7%) severe-critical] admitted to a field hospital in Madrid, as well as in 5 controls. RESULTS: The mean time from the first day of symptoms to the antibody test was 28 days (SD: 8.7), similar according to the severity of the disease. All patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ showed the corresponding IgG positivity, while these results were negative in all control individuals. A total of 26 (74%) cases also presented with positive IgM, 19 (83%) were severe-critical cases and 7 (58%) were mild-moderate cases. The IgM response lasted longer in the severe critical cases (mean: 29.7 days; SD: 8.4) compared to the moderate cases (mean: 21.2 days; SD: 2.0).. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid serology tests are useful for the diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 (mainly IgG detection) and may also be correlated with the severity of the infection (based on IgM detection).","Candel, F J; Viñuela-Prieto, J M; González Del Castillo, J; Barreiro García, P; Fragiel Saavedra, M; Hernández Píriz, A; Jiménez Virumbrales, D; Canora Lebrato, J; García de Casasola, G; Gil Prieto, R; San-Román Montero, J; Ortega Anselmi, J; Barba Martín, R; Prados Roa, F; Marco Martínez, J; Zapatero Gaviria, A",Rev Esp Quimioter,,619

The different possible interacting epitopes have been deeply analysed and characterized, providing evidence of the presence of glycan structures not found in previous MS-based analyses. The interaction of the RBD 13 C-labelled glycans with different human lectins, which are expressed in different organs and tissues that may be affected during the infection process, has also been evaluated by NMR. In particular, 15 N-labelled galectins (galectins-3, -7 and -8 N-terminal), Siglecs (Siglec-8, Siglec-10), and C-type lectins (DC-SIGN, MGL) have been employed. Complementary experiments from the glycoprotein perspective or from the lectin's point of view have permitted to disentangle the specific interacting epitopes in each case.

407675,Caution Is Needed When Reporting or Pooling the Prevalence of Venous Thromboembolism in Critically Ill Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients,2020,"The mental health aspect of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients in Bangladesh has remained less focused and has not been addressed properly. The objective of the study was to assess the levels of anxiety and depression in COVID-19 patients. We adopted a mixed online and telephone-based survey using Google Forms. Recruitment was performed through a snowball sampling approach. The Google Form was initially circulated in Facebook to identify interested participants. Then, three trained physicians interviewed the online responders over telephone for a period spanning from April 2020 to June 2020. Two well-known questionnaires, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), were used for the assessment of anxiety and depression, respectively. Here, the severity of anxiety was classified with the standard thresholds: minimal or none (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14) and severe (>15) for the GAD-7. Depression severity score: 0-4 was considered as none or no depression, 5-9: mild, 10-14: moderate, 15-19: moderately severe, 20-27 was for severe depression. A total of 237 patients were finally analyzed. The mean age ±SD of the patients was 41.59±13.73 years. Most of them were male (73%) and lived in urban areas (90.29%). Half of the patients were unemployed, and 17.7% admitted loss of job due to lockdown. The overall prevalence of anxiety and depression was 55.7% and 87.3%, respectively. The mean GAD-7 score was 5.79±4.95, and the mean PHQ-9 score was 5.64±5.15. Among the depressive patients, 3% had minimal depression, 38.4% had mild depression, 32.1% had moderate depression, 11.8% had moderate depression, and 2.1% had a severe depression. Similarly, 37.1%, 10.5% and 8% had mild, moderate and severe levels of anxiety, respectively. Nearly half of the study population (47.7%) was suffering from both depression and anxiety. Living in urban area was an independent predictor for depression (OR 3.882; CI: 1.249-12.069). Considering the high comorbid burden, the mental health issues of these patients need to be addressed and reinforced to the existing health system on a priority basis.","Hasan, M J; Tabssum, T; Ambia, N E; Zaman, M S; Rahman, M; Khan, A S",Mymensingh Med J,,619
407676,Caution Is Needed When Reporting or Pooling the Prevalence of Venous Thromboembolism in Critically Ill Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), seems to be difficult to overcome. A pandemic of such a scale has not been seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Although the predominant clinical presentation is respiratory disease, neurological manifestations and sequelae are increasingly being recognized. We observed a case series of rapid recovery of ARDS within 24 h in the preliminary clinical features of COVID-19 ARDS-associated neurological disease. It was also noted that by 15 April, 2021, there was no SARS-CoV-2 ARDS on Sorok Island in South Korea, where lepers had been living together. We compared each of dapsone’s effects on humans and considered those of SARS-CoV-2. Dapsone showed different effects in the brain. The Sorokdo National Hospital reported a relationship between dapsone and the neuroinflammasome of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in Sorok Island from January 2005 to June 2020. AD prevalence was low in the leprosy patient group who took dapsone regularly. The preliminary cross-sectional study of the trial group (22 subjects) and the control group (22 subjects) in the Hunt Regional Hospital reported the following results: The chi-square statistic is 5.1836. The p-value is 0.022801. The result is considered significant at p &lt;0.05. The results from the medical treatment from 21 December to 29 December 2020 were considered. The mortality rates at the ARDS onset stage were 0% with dapsone administered as a standard COVID-19 treatment and 40% without dapsone administered as a standard COVID-19 treatment, respectively. Based on the respiratory failure and sudden high death rate originating from the involvement of the brainstem, especially the pre-Bötzinger complex, dapsone can be used to significantly reduce the incidence of the cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome and other illnesses caused by SARS-CoV-2.","Kanwar, Badar Lee Chul Joong Lee Jong-Hoon",Vaccines,,619
407677,Caution Is Needed When Reporting or Pooling the Prevalence of Venous Thromboembolism in Critically Ill Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients,2020,"After the emergence of a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was initially characterized by fever, sore throat, cough, and dyspnea, mainly manifestations of respiratory system. However, other manifestations such as headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell were added to the clinical spectrum, during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reports on the neurological findings are increasing rapidly and headache seems to be the leader on the symptom list. Headache was reported in 11%-34% of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but clinical features of these headaches were totally missing in available publications. According to our initial experience, significant features of headache presentation in the symptomatic COVID-19 patients were new-onset, moderate-severe, bilateral headache with pulsating or pressing quality in the temporoparietal, forehead or periorbital region. The most striking features of the headache were sudden to gradual onset and poor response to common analgesics, or high relapse rate, that was limited to the active phase of the COVID-19. Symptomatic COVID-19 patients, around 6%-10%, also reported headache as a presenting symptom. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms of headache include activation of peripheral trigeminal nerve endings by the SARS-CoV-2 directly or through the vasculopathy and/or increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia. We concluded that as a common non-respiratory symptom of COVID-19, headache should not be overlooked, and its characteristics should be recorded with scrutiny.","Bolay, Hayrunnisa; Gül, Ahmet; Baykan, Betül",Headache,,619

410813,Uniform infection screening allowed safe head and neck surgery during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in Japan,2020,"BACKGROUND: Partial- or full-lockdowns, among other interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic, may disproportionally affect people (their behaviors and health outcomes) with lower socioeconomic status (SES). This study examines income-related health inequalities and their main contributors in China during the pandemic. METHODS: The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey is an anonymous 74-item survey administered via social media in China. A national sample of 10,545 adults in all 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in mainland China provided comprehensive data on sociodemographic characteristics, awareness and attitudes towards COVID-19, lifestyle factors, and health outcomes during the lockdown. Of them, 8448 subjects provided data for this analysis. Concentration Index (CI) and Corrected CI (CCI) were used to measure income-related inequalities in mental health and self-reported health (SRH), respectively. Wagstaff-type decomposition analysis was used to identify contributors to health inequalities. RESULTS: Most participants reported their health status as ""very good"" (39.0%) or ""excellent"" (42.3%). CCI of SRH and mental health were - 0.09 (p < 0.01) and 0.04 (p < 0.01), respectively, indicating pro-poor inequality in ill SRH and pro-rich inequality in ill mental health. Income was the leading contributor to inequalities in SRH and mental health, accounting for 62.7% (p < 0.01) and 39.0% (p < 0.05) of income-related inequalities, respectively. The COVID-19 related variables, including self-reported family-member COVID-19 infection, job loss, experiences of food and medication shortage, engagement in physical activity, and five different-level pandemic regions of residence, explained substantial inequalities in ill SRH and ill mental health, accounting for 29.7% (p < 0.01) and 20.6% (p < 0.01), respectively. Self-reported family member COVID-19 infection, experiencing food and medication shortage, and engagement in physical activity explain 9.4% (p < 0.01), 2.6% (the summed contributions of experiencing food shortage (0.9%) and medication shortage (1.7%), p < 0.01), and 17.6% (p < 0.01) inequality in SRH, respectively (8.9% (p < 0.01), 24.1% (p < 0.01), and 15.1% (p < 0.01) for mental health). CONCLUSIONS: Per capita household income last year, experiences of food and medication shortage, self-reported family member COVID-19 infection, and physical activity are important contributors to health inequalities, especially mental health in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Intervention programs should be implemented to support vulnerable groups.","Nie, Peng; Ding, Lanlin; Chen, Zhuo; Liu, Shiyong; Zhang, Qi; Shi, Zumin; Wang, Lu; Xue, Hong; Liu, Gordon G; Wang, Youfa",Int J Equity Health,,619

METHODS: Participants applied chest compression without a mask, with a surgical mask, a filtering face-piece respirator (FFR) mask, and a half-face mask with active P3 filter. A smart watch was worn on the left wrists of the participants during chest compression in each condition. They were requested to rate their fatigue on a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: Statistically higher average pulse rates were found in the FFR mask and half-face mask conditions. FFR mask and half-face mask resulted in statistically worse results than surgical mask and no-mask conditions in the number of compressions per minute, compression depth, and compression effectiveness. Further, half-face mask and FFR mask caused more fatigue in participants.

STUDY DESIGN: Secondary data analysis using dual-eligible enrollment data and health care workforce data. METHODS: We determined the density of dual-eligible beneficiaries per 1000 population in 2017 for each of 3142 US counties. County-level supply of primary care physicians (PCPs), primary care nurse practitioners, and physician assistants was determined. RESULTS: One-third of the 791 counties with the highest density of dual-eligible beneficiaries had PCP shortages. Counties with the highest density of dual-eligible beneficiaries and the fewest primary care clinicians of any type were concentrated in Southeastern states. These areas also had some of the highest coronavirus disease 2019 outbreaks within their states. CONCLUSIONS: States in the Southeastern region of the United States with some of the most restrictive scope-of-practice laws have an inadequate supply of primary care providers to serve a high concentration of dual-eligible beneficiaries. The fragmented care of the dually eligible population leads to extremely high costs, prompting policy makers to consider integrated delivery models that emphasize primary care. However, primary care workforce shortages will be an enduring challenge without scope-of-practice reforms.","Xu, Wendy Y; Retchin, Sheldon M; Buerhaus, Peter",Am J Manag Care,,619

Durable long-term humoral immunity is mediated by antibodies secreted by plasma cells that preexist subsequent exposures and by memory B cells that rapidly respond to infections once they have occurred. In the midst of the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019, it is important to define our current understanding of the unique roles of memory B cells and plasma cells in immunity and the factors that control the formation and persistence of these cell types. This fundamental knowledge is the basis to interpret findings from natural infections and vaccines. Here, we review transcriptional and metabolic programs that promote and support B cell fates and functions, suggesting points at which these pathways do and do not intersect.

479775,A Simple Approach for Gas Blender on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Resource Shortage Context,2020,"Abstract INTRODUCTION: The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has greatly challenged public health worldwide. A growing number of studies have reported gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. We performed a systematic review of GI symptoms associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as of the serum levels of biomarkers related to liver function and lesion in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. METHODS: We surveyed relevant articles published in English, Spanish, and Portuguese up to July, 2020 in the PubMed, MEDLINE, SciELO, LILACS, and BVS databases. Moreover, we surveyed potentially important articles in journals such as the NEJM, JAMA, BMJ, Gut, and AJG. RESULTS: This systematic review included 43 studies, including 18,246 patients. Diarrhea was the most common GI symptom, affecting 11.5% of the patients, followed by nausea and vomiting (6.3%) and abdominal pain (2.3%). With regard to clinical severity, 17.5% of the patients were classified as severely ill, whereas 9.8% of them were considered to have a non-severe disease. Some studies showed increased aspartate transaminase and alanine aminotransferase levels in a portion of the 209 analyzed patients and two studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that digestive symptoms are common in COVID-19 patients. In addition, alterations in cytolysis biomarkers could also be observed in a lesser proportion, calling attention to the possibility of hepatic involvement in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals.","Silva, Filipe Antônio França da; Brito, Breno Bittencourt de; Santos, Maria Luísa Cordeiro; Marques, Hanna Santos; Silva Júnior, Ronaldo Teixeira da; Carvalho, Lorena Sousa de; Vieira, Elise Santos; Oliveira, Márcio Vasconcelos; Melo, Fabrício Freire de",Rev.

By experimenting with the addition of mica of varying thickness to the optical path when viewing a flattened gahnite and garnet in crossed polars, we found that the observed interference figure was the result of the mica even when exceedingly thin. Multiple flattened almandine crystals have also been extracted from muscovite books from Avondale, Pennsylvania. White included the results of optical analyses performed by our research group on a flattened gahnite, which showed that the crystal exhibited a distinctly biaxial interference figure despite being an isometric mineral.

Although the COVID-19 survival rate is high, the number of severe cases that result in death is increasing daily. A timely prediction of at-risk patients of COVID-19 with precautionary measures is expected to increase the survival rate of patients and reduce the fatality rate. This research provides a prediction method for the early identification of COVID-19 patient's outcome based on patients' characteristics monitored at home, while in quarantine. The study was performed using 287 COVID-19 samples of patients from the King Fahad University Hospital, Saudi Arabia. The data were analyzed using three classification algorithms, namely, logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). Initially, the data were preprocessed using several preprocessing techniques. Furthermore, 10-k cross-validation was applied for data partitioning and SMOTE for alleviating the data imbalance. Experiments were performed using twenty clinical features, identified as significant for predicting the survival versus the deceased COVID-19 patients. The results showed that RF outperformed the other classifiers with an accuracy of 0.95 and area under curve (AUC) of 0.99. The proposed model can assist the decision-making and health care professional by early identification of at-risk COVID-19 patients effectively.

485645,Statewide Real-Time Tracking of Beds and Ventilators During Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Beyond,2020,"BACKGROUND: The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has put a serious burden on the healthcare system worldwide. Due to varied manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, many scoring systems, which were earlier used for community acquired pneumonia (CAP) are in use to determine the disease severity and the need of ICU admissions for proper management. COVID-19 is a relatively new disease and the validity of these scoring systems in SARS-CoV-2 infection is not completely known. This study aimed to validate these scoring systems in cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in an Indian setup. The study has also tried to find the most accurate indicator of disease severity and 14-day mortality among these scoring systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 122 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at a tertiary hospital in Ranchi, Jharkhand. The severity of the disease according to ICMR protocol for COVID-19, the PSI/PORT score, the CURB-65 score and the SCAP score were calculated in all the patients and analysed with the disease outcome, that is, 14-day mortality. RESULTS: SCAP score, PSI/PORT score and CURB-65 criteria, all were good indicators of disease severity and 14-day mortality. However, when compared to other scoring systems, SCAP score was a more accurate marker of disease severity and 14-day mortality. CONCLUSION: The PSI/PORT scoring system, the CURB-65 criteria and the SCAP scoring system can be used to assess the COVID-19 severity and predict the 14-day mortality risk in cases of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Anurag, Aditya; Preetam, Mukul",The clinical respiratory journal (Online),,619

OBJECTIVE: To assess the risks of COVID-19 and COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality in patients with BP and pemphigus and to delineate determinants of severe COVID-19 illness among these patients. METHODS: A population-based cohort study compared COVID-19 and its complications in patients with BP (n = 1845) and pemphigus (n = 1236) with age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched control subjects. RESULTS: The risks of COVID-19 (hazard rate [HR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-1.73; P = .691) and COVID-19-associated hospitalization (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.84-2.98; P = .160) was comparable between patients with BP and controls. The risk of COVID-19-associated mortality was higher among patients with BP (HR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.15-6.92; P = .023). The risk of COVID-19 (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.44-1.49; P = .496), COVID-19-associated hospitalization (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.53-3.76; P = .499), and COVID-19-associated mortality (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.15-11.92; P = .789) was similar in patients with pemphigus and their controls. Systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants did not predispose COVID-19-positive BP and pemphigus patients to a more severe illness. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective data collection. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BP experience increased COVID-19-associated mortality and should be monitored closely. Maintaining systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive adjuvant agents during the pandemic is not associated with worse outcomes.","Kridin, Khalaf; Schonmann, Yochai; Weinstein, Orly; Schmidt, Enno; Ludwig, Ralf J; Cohen, Arnon D",J.

489873,Commentary: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for Coronavirus Disease 2019: A step toward enlightenment or still flying blind?,2021,"Background: Recent studies have reported that COVID-19 infected patients with stroke, who were often in the older age group, had a higher incidence of vascular risk factors, and more severe infection related respiratory symptoms. These observations provided little evidence to suggest that COVID-19 infection is a potential causative factor for stroke. This report describes a young patient with a cerebellar stroke secondary to COVID-19 infection. Case presentation: A 45-year old male presented at a hospital, reporting a two-day history of headache, vertigo, persistent vomiting, and unsteady gait. Physical examination revealed gaze-evoked nystagmus on extraocular movement testing, left-sided dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia. He was diagnosed with a left cerebellar stroke. An external ventricular drain was inserted, and sub-occipital craniectomy was performed to manage the effects of elevated intracranial pressure due to the extent of oedema secondary to the infarct. He also underwent screening for the COVID-19 infection, which was positive on SARS-COV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing of his endotracheal aspirate. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples were negative. After the surgery, the patient developed atrial fibrillation and had prolonged vomiting symptoms, but these resolved eventually with symptomatic treatment. He was started on aspirin and statin therapy, but anticoagulation was withheld due to bleeding concerns. The external ventricular drain was removed nine days after the surgery. He continued with active rehabilitation. Conclusions: Young patients with COVID-19 infection may be more susceptible to stroke, even in the absence of risk factors. Standard treatment with aspirin and statins remains essential in the management of COVID-19 related stroke. Anticoagulation for secondary prevention in those with atrial fibrillation should not be routine and has to be carefully evaluated for its benefits compared to the potential harms of increased bleeding associated with COVID-19 infection.","Loo, K.

In addition to conveying that the dialogue agent is mentally present and engaged with the task, referring to historical states may be crucial for enabling collaborative planning (e.g., for planning to return to a previous state, or diagnosing a past misstep). In this paper, we approach the problem of spatial memory in a multi-modal spoken dialogue system capable of answering questions about interaction history in a physical blocks world setting. This work builds upon a full spatial question-answering pipeline consisting of a vision system, speech input and output mediated by an animated avatar, a dialogue system that robustly interprets spatial queries, and a constraint solver that derives answers based on 3-D spatial modelling. The contributions of this work include a symbolic dialogue context registering knowledge about discourse history and changes in the world, as well as a natural language understanding module capable of interpreting free-form historical questions and querying the dialogue context to form an answer.","Kane, Benjamin; Platonov, Georgiy; Schubert, Lenhart K.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12501v1.pdf,619

Data on hypertension management among Shenzhen elderly are sparse. Our study aims to investigate treated and controlled hypertension in Shenzhen elderly, and identify relevant predictors. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: Communities in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study was conducted. We employed a convenience sampling method to select participants; 124 007 participants aged 65 years and older were recruited from January to December 2018 at local community health centres in Shenzhen. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data on treatment, control and influencing factors of hypertension were obtained from a standard questionnaire, physical measurements and biochemical analyses. RESULTS: Prevalence of hypertension was 55.8% among the sample population. Among this group of hypertensive patients, those undergoing hypertension treatment and those with hypertension under control were 54.4% and 32.3%, respectively. Employing multivariate analysis, significant associations were found between treatment and older age, junior high school education and above (OR=1.25, pï¼0.05), being widowed rather than being married or cohabiting (OR=1.28, pï¼0.05), engaging in physical activity (OR=1.14, pï¼0.05), ex-smoker (OR=1.19, pï¼0.05), habitual drinker (OR=0.72, pï¼0.05), history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (OR=2.20, pï¼0.05) and comorbidities, with a higher probability for those with obesity (OR=1.89, pï¼0.05), central obesity (OR=1.10, pï¼0.05), diabetes (OR=1.49, pï¼0.05) or dyslipidaemia (OR=1.20, pï¼0.05).

594709,Telemedicine in cardiovascular surgery during COVID‐19 pandemic: A systematic review and our experience,2020-08-16,"The occurrence of viral coinfections in childhood pneumonia has received little attention, probably because suitable detection methods have been lacking. Between November 2004 and October 2006, the presence of 14 respiratory viruses in children aged less than 3 years old with community‐acquired pneumonia were investigated using molecular or immunochromatographic techniques and/or viral culture. A total of 315 children (338 episodes) were included, and hospitalization was required in 178 episodes. At least one virus was detected in 66.9% of the episodes and simultaneous detection of two or more viruses was frequent (27% of the episodes with viral detection). The most frequently detected virus was respiratory syncytial virus (n = 67: 33 subgroup A, 33 subgroup B, 1 not typed), followed by human bocavirus (n = 48), rhinovirus (n = 46), human metapneumovirus (n = 39: 13 genotype A2, 8 B1, 5 B2, 1 A1, 12 not genotyped) and parainfluenza viruses (n = 38: 1 type 1, 3 type 2, 22 type 3, 11 type 4 and 1 not typed). The 14 viruses investigated were found in viral coinfections, which were more frequent in children aged less than 12 months. Except for adenovirus, the incidence of which was low, the percentage of viral coinfection ranged between 28.2% and 68.8%. Children with viral coinfection more frequently required hospital admission than those with single viral infection.

Creating models to describe and quantify alternative mitigation strategies becomes increasingly urgent. In this study, we propose an agent-based model of disease transmission in a society divided into closely connected families, workplaces, and social groups. This allows us to discuss mitigation strategies, including targeted quarantine measures. We find that workplace and more diffuse social contacts are roughly equally important to disease spread, and that an effective lockdown must target both. We examine the cost–benefit of replacing a lockdown with tracing and quarantining contacts of the infected. Quarantine can contribute substantially to mitigation, even if it has short duration and is done within households. When reopening society, testing and quarantining is a strategy that is much cheaper in terms of lost workdays than a long lockdown. A targeted quarantine strategy is quite efficient with only 5 days of quarantine, and its effect increases when testing is more widespread.","Eilersen, Andreas; Sneppen, Kim",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-75640-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33122753/,619

Aims To test whether the prevalence of problem drinking has changed from before to during the COVID-19 crisis in the US and UK. Design/Setting We examined nationally representative longitudinal data on how problem drinking has changed from pre-pandemic levels among adults in the US (N=7,327; Understanding America Study) and UK (N=12,594; UK Household Longitudinal Study). Methods In the US, we examined rates of consuming alcohol [≥] 4 times in the past week at baseline (March, 2020) and across four waves of follow-up (April-May, 2020). In the UK we assessed the prevalence of consuming alcohol [≥] 4 times per week and weekly heavy episodic drinking using the AUDIT-C at baseline (2017-2019) and during the COVID-19 lockdown (April, 2020). We also tested whether there were specific groups at greater risk of increased problem drinking during the pandemic. Results Among US adults, there was a statistically significant increase in the percentage of participants reporting drinking alcohol [≥] 4 times a week which rose significantly from 11.7% to 17.9% (53% increase, p < .001) as the COVID-19 crisis developed in the US. Among UK adults, the percentage of participants reporting drinking [≥] 4 times a week increased significantly from 14.2% to 23% (62% increase, p < .001) and heavy episodic drinking at least weekly increased significantly from 9.7% to 16.6% (71% increase, p < .001) when compared to pre-COVID-19 lockdown levels. Trends were similar across population demographics, although those aged under 50 years and higher income groups displayed the largest increases. Conclusions The COVID-19 crisis has been associated with substantial increases in problematic drinking in both US and UK adults.","Daly, M.; Robinson, E.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.25.20139022; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.25.20139022v1?rss=1,619

The implementation of stringent measures to stop COVID-19 dissemination had an influence on healthcare services and associated procedures, possibly causing antibiotic consumption fluctuations. This paper aims to evaluate the immediate and long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on antibiotic prescribing trends in outpatient care of the Portuguese public health sector, including in primary healthcare centers and hospitals, as well as on specific antibiotic groups known to be closely associated with increased resistance. Segmented regression analysis with interrupted time series data was used to analyze whether the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact in antibiotic prescribing tendencies at a national level. The outcomes from this quasi-experimental approach demonstrate that, at the beginning of the pandemic, a significant, immediate decrease in the overall antibiotic prescribing trends was noticed in the context of outpatient care in Portugal, followed by a statistically non-significant fall over the long term. The data also showed a significant reduction in the prescription of particular antibiotic classes (antibiotics from the Watch group, 3rd-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and clarithromycin) upon COVID-19 emergence. These findings revealed an important disruption in antibiotics prescribing caused by the current public health emergency.","Silva, Tânia Magalhães; Estrela, Marta; Gomes, Eva Rebelo; Piñeiro-Lamas, Maria; Figueiras, Adolfo; Roque, Fátima; Herdeiro, Maria Teresa",Antibiotics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34572622/; https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10091040,619

The retromer core (VPS26/VPS29/VPS35) is present on cargo-transporting, tubular carriers along with a range of sorting nexins. Here, we elucidate the structural basis of membrane tubulation and coupled cargo recognition by metazoan and fungal retromer coats assembled with the non–Bin1/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) sorting nexin SNX3 using cryo–electron tomography. The retromer core retains its arched, scaffolding structure but changes its mode of membrane recruitment when assembled with different SNX adaptors, allowing cargo recognition at subunit interfaces. Thus, membrane bending and cargo incorporation can be modulated to allow retromer to traffic cargoes along different cellular transport routes.","Leneva, Natalya; Kovtun, Oleksiy; Morado, Dustin R.; Briggs, John A.

The S1 contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that can specifically bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor on target cells. Here we show that a recombinant fusion protein (designated RBD-Fc) containing 193-amino acid RBD (residues 318–510) and a human IgG1 Fc fragment can induce highly potent antibody responses in the immunized rabbits. The antibodies recognized RBD on S1 domain and completely inhibited SARS-CoV infection at a serum dilution of 1:10,240. Rabbit antisera effectively blocked binding of S1, which contains RBD, to ACE2. This suggests that RBD can induce highly potent neutralizing antibody responses and has potential to be developed as an effective and safe subunit vaccine for prevention of SARS.","He, Yuxian; Zhou, Yusen; Liu, Shuwen; Kou, Zhihua; Li, Wenhui; Farzan, Michael; Jiang, Shibo",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X04021588; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X04021588; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15474494/,619

It is important to not only diagnose post-stroke dysphagia early but also to evaluate the protective mechanism that counteracts aspiration, i.e., primarily cough. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive value of cough frequency in addition to aspiration risk for pneumonia outcome. Methods: This was a single-center prospective observational study. Patients with first-ever strokes underwent clinical swallowing evaluation, fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), and overnight cough recording using LEOSound(®) (Löwenstein Medical GmbH & Co. KG, Bad Ems, Germany ). Penetration–Aspiration Scale (PAS) ratings and cough frequency measurements were correlated with incidence of pneumonia at discharge. Results: 11 women (37%) and 19 men (63%), mean age 70.3 years (SD ± 10.6), with ischemic stroke and dysphagia were enrolled. Correlation analysis showed statistically significant relationships between pneumonia and PAS (r = 0.521; p < 0.05), hourly cough frequency (r = 0,441; p < 0.05), and categories of cough severity (r = 0.428 p < 0.05), respectively. Logistic regression showed significant predictive effects of PAS (b = 0.687; p = 0.014) and cough frequency (b = 0.239; p = 0.041) for pneumonia outcome. Conclusion: Cough frequency in addition to aspiration risk was an independent predictor of pneumonia in dysphagic stroke survivors.","Pekacka-Egli, Anna Maria; Kazmierski, Radoslaw; Lutz, Dietmar; Kulnik, Stefan Tino; Pekacka-Falkowska, Katarzyna; Maszczyk, Adam; Windisch, Wolfram; Boeselt, Tobias; Spielmanns, Marc",Brain Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11070847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34202226/,619

Such lapses included omitting user training and fit testing, provision of unapproved devices, and application of devices in settings and ways for which they were not intended. The temporary compromise of professionally accepted standards due to exigencies must not become the new normal.

610396,Spectrum of Vascular Involvement in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia—Findings on CT Perfusion,2020-10-21,"Introduction: Coronaviruses encode a helicase that is essential for viral replication and represents an excellent antiviral target. However, only a few coronavirus helicase inhibitors have been patented. These patents include drug-like compound SSYA10-001, aryl diketo acids (ADK), and dihydroxychromones. Additionally, adamantane-derived bananins, natural flavonoids, one acrylamide derivative [(E)-3-(furan-2-yl)-N-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)acrylamide], a purine derivative (7-ethyl-8-mercapto-3-methyl-3,7-dihydro-1 H-purine-2,6-dione), and a few bismuth complexes. The IC(50) of patented inhibitors ranges between 0.82 μM and 8.95 μM, depending upon the assays used. Considering the urgency of clinical interventions against Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19), it is important to consider developing antiviral portfolios consisting of small molecules. Areas covered: This review examines coronavirus helicases as antiviral targets, and the potential of previously patented and experimental compounds to inhibit the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) helicase. Expert opinion: Small molecule coronavirus helicase inhibitors represent attractive pharmacological modalities for the treatment of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Rightfully so, the current emphasis is focused upon the development of vaccines. However, vaccines may not work for everyone and broad-based adoption of vaccinations is an increasingly challenging societal endeavor. Therefore, it is important to develop additional pharmacological antivirals against the highly conserved coronavirus helicases to broadly protect against this and subsequent coronavirus epidemics.","Spratt, Austin N.; Gallazzi, Fabio; Quinn, Thomas P.; Lorson, Christian L.; Sönnerborg, Anders; Singh, Kamal",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,https://doi.org/10.1080/13543776.2021.1884224; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33593200/,619

We designed a case-control study to assess the alterations of endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD) among convalescent COVID-19 patients. Methods: COVID-19 patients referred to a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Unit within 2 months from swab test negativization were consecutively evaluated for inclusion and compared to controls matched for age, gender, and cardiovascular risk factors. Results: A total of 133 convalescent COVID-19 patients (81.2% males, mean age 61.6 years) and 133 matched controls (80.5% males, mean age 60.4 years) were included. A significantly lower FMD was documented in convalescent COVID-19 patients as compared to controls (3.2% ± 2.6 vs. 6.4% ± 4.1 p < 0.001), confirmed when stratifying the study population according to age and major clinical variables. Among cases, females exhibited significantly higher FMD values as compared to males (6.1% ± 2.9 vs. 2.5% ± 1.9, p < 0.001). Thus, no significant difference was observed between cases and controls in the subgroup analysis on females (6.1% ± 2.9 vs. 5.3% ± 3.4, p = 0.362). Among convalescent COVID-19 patients, FMD showed a direct correlation with arterial oxygen tension (rho = 0.247, p = 0.004), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (rho = 0.436, p < 0.001), forced vital capacity (rho = 0.406, p < 0.001), and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (rho = 0.280, p = 0.008). Overall, after adjusting for major confounders, a recent COVID-19 was a major and independent predictor of FMD values (β = −0.427, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome is associated with a persistent and sex-biased endothelial dysfunction, directly correlated with the severity of pulmonary impairment.","Ambrosino, Pasquale; Calcaterra, Ilenia; Molino, Antonio; Moretta, Pasquale; Lupoli, Roberta; Spedicato, Giorgio Alfredo; Papa, Antimo; Motta, Andrea; Maniscalco, Mauro; Di Minno, Matteo Nicola Dario",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34440161/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9080957,619

We study the effects of the policy actions on the progression of the pandemic in the first containment period in spring 2020 before easing of measures have started to work by the end of April. To exploit both the time and spatial dimension in the dissemination of the virus, we conduct a spatial data panel analysis for German NUTS-3 regions. Specifically, we employ a spatial difference-in-differences approach to identify the effects of individual public health measures. We find that contact restrictions and closure of schools substantially contributed to flattening the infection curve. Additionally, a strong treatment effect of wearing face masks is established in the few treated regions during the containment phase. No incremental effect is evidenced for closure of establishments and shutdown of shopping malls and other stores. These findings prove to be highly robust to changes in model specification. By contrast, the dampening effect of restaurant closure is sensitive to model variation.","Kosfeld, R.; Mitze, T.; Rode, J.; Waelde, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248173v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.15.20248173,619

Several novel methods for preparing vaccine candidates are currently undergoing clinical evaluation in response to the urgent need to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In many cases, these methods rely on new approaches for vaccine production and immune stimulation. We report on the use of a novel method (SolaVAX) for production of an inactivated vaccine candidate and the testing of that candidate in a hamster animal model for its ability to prevent infection upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2 virus. The studies employed in this work included an evaluation of the levels of neutralizing antibody produced post-vaccination, levels of specific antibody sub-types to RBD and spike protein that were generated, evaluation of viral shedding post-challenge, flow cytometric and single cell sequencing data on cellular fractions and histopathological evaluation of tissues post-challenge. The results from this preliminary evaluation provide insight into the immunological responses occurring as a result of vaccination with the proposed vaccine candidate and the impact that adjuvant formulations, specifically developed to promote Th1 type immune responses, have on vaccine efficacy and protection against infection following challenge with live SARS-CoV-2. This data may have utility in the development of effective vaccine candidates broadly.

Therefore, recall from iconic memory was measured for sets of visual images that were briefly presented in the periphery of the visual field. Using a partial-report technique, a central arrow presented at varying delays after the images was pointing to the location of the to-be-recalled target. In the direct replication (experiment 1, n = 41), participants were asked to verbally report the cued image (note that the entire planned sample size could not be reached owing to the COVID-19 pandemic), and in an extension experiment (experiment 2, n = 55), iconic memory was tested using a visual recognition test. Both experiments demonstrated prioritized selection of emotional targets from iconic memory, with higher verbal recall and visual recognition accuracy for negative and positive targets compared to neutral targets. In addition, we found that the presence of emotional distractors in the set interfered with the selection of neutral targets, thus confirming a trend that was observed in the original study. Exponential decay curves further revealed that both target and distractor valence primarily affected initial availability (in case of verbal recall) and attentional selection, whereas the decay of iconic memory with increasing cue delay was less sensitive to the emotional meaning.","Kattner, Florian; Clausen, Alexandra",R Soc Open Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33204435/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.191507,619

Clinical and laboratory features were evaluated among survivors and non-survivors. The correlation between variables and duration of hospitalization and admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was determined. Male sex, age, hospitalization duration, and admission to ICU were significantly related to mortality rate. Headache was a more common feature in patients who survived (p = 0.017). It was also related to a shorter stay in the hospital (p = 0.032) as opposed to patients who experienced chest pain (p = 0.033). Decreased levels of consciousness and dyspnea were statistically more frequent in non-survivors (p = 0.003 and p = 0.011, respectively). Baseline white blood cell count (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly higher in non-survivors (p < 0.001).

This study considers the future perceived integration of AI with digital radiology after the COVID-19 pandemic and proposes a methodology that, by means of a wide interaction of the involved actors, allows a positioning exercise for acceptance evaluation using a general purpose electronic survey. The methodology was tested on a first category of professionals, the medical radiology technicians (MRT), and allowed to (i) collect their impressions on the issue in a structured way, and (ii) collect their suggestions and their comments in order to create a specific tool for this professional figure to be used in scientific societies. This study is useful for the stakeholders in the field, and yielded several noteworthy observations, among them (iii) the perception of great development in thoracic radiography and CT, but a loss of opportunity in integration with non-radiological technologies; (iv) the belief that it is appropriate to invest in training and infrastructure dedicated to AI; and (v) the widespread idea that AI can become a strong complementary tool to human activity.

It is crucial to determine the extent to which adolescents follow COVID-19 preventive measures and identify factors relating to such behaviors to implement more effective health education. This study aimed to understand factors related to COVID-19 preventive behaviors using the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and the health belief model (HBM) among adolescents in South Korea. DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional face-to-face questionnaire survey was conducted among 272 adolescents in South Korea. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationships between perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, intention, and COVID-19 preventive behaviors. RESULTS: Among adolescents' COVID-19 preventive behavior scores, wearing masks was the highest and distancing was the lowest. Adolescents' adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviors was directly or indirectly associated with their perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intention. CONCLUSIONS: Attention to mitigate social isolation is important to improve compliance with COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intention explained 61.3% of adolescents' COVID-19 preventive behaviors, there is a need for education to promote relevant factors.

Alpha and Beta replicated similarly to D614G strain in Vero, Caco-2, Calu-3 and primary airway cells. However, Alpha and Beta formed larger and more numerous syncytia. Variant spike proteins displayed higher ACE2 affinity compared to D614G. Alpha, Beta and D614G fusion was similarly inhibited by interferon induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs). Individual mutations present in Alpha and Beta spikes modified fusogenicity, binding to ACE2 or recognition by monoclonal antibodies. We further show that Delta spike also triggers faster fusion relative to D614G. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 emerging variants display enhanced syncytia formation.","Michael Rajah, Maaran; Hubert, Mathieu; Bishop, Elodie; Saunders, Nell; Robinot, Remy; Grzelak, Ludivine; Planas, Delphine; Dufloo, Jérémy; Gellenoncourt, Stacy; Bongers, Alice; Zivaljic, Marija; Planchais, Cyril; Guivel-Benhassine, Florence; Porrot, Françoise; Mouquet, Hugo; Chakrabarti, Lisa A; Buchrieser, Julian; Schwartz, Olivier",The EMBO journal,https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2021108944; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34601723/,619

However, to our knowledge, association of COVID-19 with bradycardia has not been reported. This case study describes sinus bradycardia as a potential manifestation of COVID-19. This is a retrospective case series of four patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, admitted to St. Luke’s University Health Network ICU between 24 March 2020 and 5 April 2020. Medical records of these patients were reviewed using the EPIC electronic health record system. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were reviewed against periods of bradycardia in each patient. The patient group comprised two males and two females. Two patients had pre-existing cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities but no history of arrythmias. Heart rates ranged between 66 and 88 beats/min on admission. The lowest rates during bradycardia were between 42 and 49 beats/min. The onset of sinus bradycardia in patients 1, 2, and 3 were day nine, 15, and five of illness, respectively. Patient 4 had three episodes of bradycardia, starting on day 10 of illness. Patients’ bradycardia episodes lasted one to 14 days. During bradycardia, maximum body temperatures ranged between 99.9 and 100.2 degree Fahrenheit. Patients 2, 3, and 4 required vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg during episodes. All four patients were on propofol at some point during bradycardia with patients 1, 2, and 3 also receiving dexmedetomidine. There was no consistent correlation of these medications with bradycardia. Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings included sinus bradycardia. Prolonged QTc interval observed in patient 2 on admission improved during bradycardia. Transient sinus bradycardia is a possible manifestation of COVID-19 and is important for close CV surveillance. Etiology can be multifactorial, but severe hypoxia, inflammatory damage of cardiac pacemaker cells, and exaggerated response to medications are possible triggers. High levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines may act directly on the sinoatrial (SA) node contributing to the development of bradycardia. This may be a warning sign of the onset of a serious cytokine storm. An increased awareness of possible exaggerated bradycardia response is important to consider with the use of empiric medications which have arrhythmogenic effects.","Amaratunga, Eluwana A; Corwin, Douglas S; Moran, Lynn; Snyder, Richard",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32550090/,619

Lack of an effective vaccine and/or antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent, has severely hampered the response to this novel coronavirus. Natural products have long been used in traditional medicines to treat various diseases, and purified phytochemicals from medicinal plants provide a valuable scaffold for the discovery of new drug leads. In the present study, we performed a computational screening of an in-house database composed of ∼1000 phytochemicals derived from traditional Saudi medicinal plants with recognised antiviral activity. Structure-based virtual screening was carried out against three druggable SARS-CoV-2 targets, viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) and papain like protease (PLpro) to identify putative inhibitors that could facilitate the development of potential anti-COVID-19 drug candidates. Computational analyses identified three compounds inhibiting each target, with binding affinity scores ranging from-9.9 to -6.5 kcal/mol. Among these, luteolin 7-rutinoside, chrysophanol 8-(6-galloylglucoside) and kaempferol 7-(6’’-galloylglucoside) bound efficiently to RdRp, while chrysophanol 8-(6-galloylglucoside), 3,4,5-tri-O-galloylquinic acid and mulberrofuran G interacted strongly with 3CLpro, and withanolide A, isocodonocarpine and calonysterone bound tightly to PLpro. These potential drug candidates will be subjected to further in vitro and in vivo studies and may assist the development of effective anti-COVID-19 drugs.","Alamri, Mubarak A.; Altharawi, Ali; Alabbas, Alhumaidi B.; Alossaimi, Manal A.; Alqahtani, Safar M.",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878535220302835; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878535220302835?v=s5,619

METHODS: Retrospective review of electronic medical records of all patients presenting to the ophthalmology department from March 23, 2020, to July 15, 2020, was compared with that from March 23, 2019, to July 15, 2019. The data between March 23, 2020, to May 31, 2020 (lockdown) and June 06, 2020, to July 15, 2020 (unlock) was compared separately. Parameters evaluated were age, gender, presenting complaints, final diagnosis, treatment advised, and surgical interventions. RESULTS: During the lockdown, routine outpatient flow reduced by 97.14% (P < 0.001), the median age of presentation decreased to 29 years (55 years last year) and males increased by 4.7% (from 61.51% to 66.21%) in 2020. Emergency services decreased by 35.25%, percentage of children decreased by 4.28% (from 34.28% to 30%) and males increased by 13.53% (from 59.97% to 73.5%). Mechanical trauma, microbial keratitis, and conjunctivitis were the most common reasons for presentation. The former lessened by 41.75% while the latter two amplified by 1.25 times and 2 times, respectively. While sanitizer-associated chemical injury increased in proportion, endophthalmitis, and postoperative complications declined. The number of donor corneas collected and emergency therapeutic keratoplasties performed decreased by 99.61% and 92.39%, respectively (P < 0.001). During the unlocking phase, routine patient consultations were 71 ± 19/day, significantly lower than 978 ± 109/day of last year (P < 0.001). No voluntary eye donation was reported during this period. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic and national lockdown severely hampered the delivery of ophthalmic care by the apex-ophthalmic institute. Unlike anticipated, lifting of pandemic-associated lockdown served only minimally in improving patient inflow in its initial phases.","Agarwal, Rinky; Sharma, Namrata; Patil, Anuja; Thakur, Himani; Saxena, Rohit; Kumar, Atul",Indian J Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33120625/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_2366_20,619

Little is known about the association between hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and cognitive function. METHODS: From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999–2002, we selected study participants (≥60 years, n = 1,529) without hepatitis B, C, or D virus infection; without previous hepatitis A vaccination; and without abnormal liver function. HAV-seropositive participants represented people with previous HAV infection. Psychomotor speed and executive functioning domain of cognitive function were measured by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). RESULTS: HAV-seropositive participants had lower DSST scores than HAV-seronegative participants (weighted mean, 44.4 vs 53.9, p < .001). We designated HAV-seronegative participants as the reference group. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the weighted β coefficient of DSST score was −9.55 (95% confidence interval [CI] −9.57 to −9.54, p < .001) for the HAV-seropositive participants. In a multivariable model, the weighted adjusted β coefficient of DSST score was −2.48 (95% CI −2.49 to −2.46, p < .001) for the HAV-seropositive participants.

652665,Frequency and Analysis of Unplanned Extubation in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients,2020-11-24,"From Rockefeller's support of patent medicine to Gates' patent vaccines, medical establishment invested a great deal in intellectual ignorance. Through the control over medical education and research it has created a public illusion to prop up corporate profit and encouraged the lust for money and power. An overview of data on cancer and vaccine sciences, the status of Americans' health, a survey of repeated failed projects, economic toxicity, and heavy drug consumption or addiction among young and old provide compelling evidence that in the twentieth century nearly all classic disease categories (congenital, inheritance, neonatal, or induced) shifted to increase induced diseases. Examples of this deceptology in ignoring or minimizing, and mocking fundamental discoveries and theories in cancer and vaccine sciences are attacks on research showing that (a), effective immunity is responsible for defending and killing pathogens and defective cancerous cells, correcting and repairing genetic mutations; (b) viruses cause cancer; and (c), abnormal gene mutations are often the consequences of (and secondary to) disturbances in effective immunity. The outcomes of cancer reductionist approaches to therapies reveal failure rates of 90% (+/‐5) for solid tumors; loss of over 50 million lives and waste of $30‐50 trillions on too many worthless, out‐of‐focus, and irresponsible projects. Current emphasis on vaccination of public with pathogen‐specific vaccines and ingredients seems new terms for drugging young and old. Cumulative exposures to low level carcinogens and environmental hazards or high energy electronic devices (EMF; 5G) are additional triggers to vaccine toxicities (antigen‐mitochondrial overload) or “seeds of immune destruction” that create mini electrical shocks (molecular sinks holes) in highly synchronized and regulated immune network that retard time‐energy‐dependent biorhythms in organs resulting in causes, exacerbations or consequences of mild, moderate or severe immune disorders. Four generations of drug‐dependent Americans strongly suggest that medical establishment has practiced decades of intellectual deception through its claims on “war on cancer”; that cancer is 100, 200, or 1000 diseases; identification of “individual” genetic mutations to cure diseases; “vaccines are safe”. Such immoral and unethical practices, along with intellectual harassment and bullying, censoring or silencing of independent and competent professionals (“Intellectual Me Too”) present grave concerns, far greater compared with the sexual harassment of ‘Me Too’ movement that was recently spearheaded by NIH. The principal driving forces behind conducting deceptive and illogical medical/cancer and vaccine projects seem to be; (a) huge return of investment and corporate profit for selling drugs and vaccines; (b) maintenance of abusive power over public health; (c) global control of population growth via increased induction of diseases, infertility, decline in life‐span, and death. An overview of accidental discoveries that we established and extended since 1980s, on models of acute and chronic ocular inflammatory diseases, provides series of the first evidence for a direct link between inflammation and multistep immune dysfunction in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. Results are relevant to demonstrate that current emphasis on vaccinating the unborn, newborn, or infant would induce immediate or long‐term immune disorders (eg, low birth weight, preterm birth, fatigue, autism, epilepsy/seizures, BBB leakage, autoimmune, neurodegenerative or digestive diseases, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular problems, or cancers). Vaccination of the unborn is likely to disturb trophoblast‐embryo‐fetus‐placenta biology and orderly growth of embryo‐fetus, alter epithelial‐mesenchymal transition or constituent‐inducible receptors, damage mitochondria, and diverse function of histamine‐histidine pathways. Significant increased in childhood illnesses are likely due to toxicities of vaccine and incipient (eg, metals [Al, Hg], detergents, fetal tissue, DNA/RNA) that retard bioenergetics of mitochondria, alter polarization‐depolarization balance of tumoricidal (Yin) and tumorigenic (Yang) properties of immunity. Captivated by complex electobiology of immunity, this multidisciplinary perspective is an attempt to initiate identifying bases for increased induction of immune disorders in three to four generations in America. We hypothesize that (a) gene‐environment‐immune biorhythms parallel neuronal function (brain neuroplasticity) with super‐packages of inducible (adaptive or horizontal) electronic signals and (b) autonomic sympathetic and parasympathetic circuitry that shape immunity (Yin‐Yang) cannot be explained by limited genomics (innate, perpendicular) that conventionally explain certain inherited diseases (eg, sickle cell anemia, progeria). Future studies should focus on deep learning of complex electrobiology of immunity that requires differential bioenergetics from mitochondria and cytoplasm. Approaches to limit or control excessive activation of gene‐environment‐immunity are keys to assess accurate disease risk formulations, prevent inducible diseases, and develop universal safe vaccines that promote health, the most basic human right.","Khatami, Mahin",Clin Transl Med,https://doi.org/10.1002/ctm2.215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33377661/,619

Due to the lengthening pandemic and evolving nature of the virus, predicting potential residues prone to mutation is crucial for the management of remdesivir resistance. Using a rational ligand-based interface design complemented with mutational mapping, we generated a total of 100,000 mutations and provided insight into the functional outcomes of mutations in the remdesivir-binding site in nsp12 subunit of RdRp. After designing 46 residues in the remdesivir-binding site of nsp12, the designs retained 97%–98% sequence identity, suggesting that very few mutations in nsp12 are required for SARS-CoV-2 to attain remdesivir resistance. Several mutants displayed decreased binding affinity to remdesivir, suggesting drug resistance. These hotspot residues had a higher probability of undergoing selective mutation and thus conferring remdesivir resistance. Identifying the potential residues prone to mutation improves our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 drug resistance and COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Padhi, Aditya K.; Shukla, Rohit; Saudagar, Prakash; Tripathi, Timir",iScience,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589004220311895; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.101992; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004220311895; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33490902/,619
660059,Adherence to Lung Protective Ventilation in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021-08-10,"OAS (2′–5′-oligoadenylate synthases) proteins and cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS, gene symbol: MB21D1) patrol the cytoplasm for the presence of foreign nucleic acids. Upon binding to double-stranded RNA or double-stranded DNA, OAS proteins and cGAS produce nucleotide second messengers to activate RNase L and STING (stimulator of interferon genes, gene symbol: TMEM173), respectively; this leads to the initiation of antiviral responses. We analyzed the evolutionary history of the MB21D1–TMEM173 and OAS–RNASEL axes in primates and bats and found evidence of widespread positive selection in both orders. In TMEM173, residue 230, a major determinant of response to natural ligands and to mimetic drugs (e.g., DMXAA), was positively selected in Primates and Chiroptera. In both orders, selection also targeted an α-helix/loop element in RNase L that modulates the enzyme preference for single-stranded RNA versus stem loops. Analysis of positively selected sites in OAS1, OAS2, and MB21D1 revealed parallel evolution, with the corresponding residues being selected in different genes. As this cannot result from gene conversion, these data suggest that selective pressure acting on OAS and MB21D1 genes is related to nucleic acid recognition and to the specific mechanism of enzyme activation, which requires a conformational change. Finally, a population genetics-phylogenetics analysis in humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas detected several positively selected sites in most genes. Data herein shed light into species-specific differences in infection susceptibility and in response to synthetic compounds, with relevance for the design of synthetic compounds as vaccine adjuvants.","Mozzi, Alessandra; Pontremoli, Chiara; Forni, Diego; Clerici, Mario; Pozzoli, Uberto; Bresolin, Nereo; Cagliani, Rachele; Sironi, Manuela",Genome Biol Evol,https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evv046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25752600/,619

We aimed to compare quality of AMI care in England and Wales during and before the COVID-19 pandemic using the 2020 European Society of Cardiology Association for Acute Cardiovascular Care quality indicators (QIs) for AMI. METHODS: Cohort study of linked data from the AMI and the percutaneous coronary intervention registries in England and Wales between 1 January 2017 and 27 May 2020 (representing 236 743 patients from 186 hospitals). At the patient level, the likelihood of attainment for each QI compared with pre COVID-19 was calculated using logistic regression. The date of the first national lockdown in England and Wales (23 March 2020) was chosen for time series comparisons. RESULTS: There were 10 749 admissions with AMI after 23 March 2020. Compared with before the lockdown, patients admitted with AMI during the first wave had similar age (mean 68.0 vs 69.0 years), with no major differences in baseline characteristics (history of diabetes (25% vs 26%), renal failure (6.4% vs 6.9%), heart failure (5.8% vs 6.4%) and previous myocardial infarction (22.9% vs 23.7%)), and less frequently had high Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk scores (43.6% vs 48.6%). There was an improvement in attainment for 10 (62.5%) of the 16 measured QIs including a composite QI (43.8% to 45.2%, OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.10) during, compared with before, the lockdown. CONCLUSION: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in England and Wales, quality of care for AMI as measured against international standards did not worsen, but improved modestly.","Aktaa, Suleman; Yadegarfar, Mohammad E; Wu, Jianhua; Rashid, Muhammad; de Belder, Mark; Deanfield, John; Schiele, Francois; Minchin, Mark; Mamas, Mamas; Gale, Chris P",BMJ Qual Saf,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjqs-2021-013040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34158396/,619

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from continuous or flash glucose monitoring systems shared through different cloud systems during the lockdown by subjects with type 1 diabetes and compared data obtained 4 weeks before and 4 weeks after structured telephonic visit. Variables considered were mean glucose, time spent in target (70–180 mg/dl), hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dl) and hyperglycemia (>180 mg/dl), coefficient of variation, and length of sensor use. RESULTS: During the 4 weeks following the telephonic visit there was an improvement of glycemic control, with a significant reduction of mean glucose values (161.1 before vs 156.3 mg/dl after, p = 0.001), an increase of the time spent in target (63.6 vs 66.3, p = 0.0009) and a reduction of time spent in hyperglycemia (33.4 vs 30.5, p = 0.002).

The previously believed chicken-specific coronavirus (CoV) M41 spike (S1) protein displayed a broad attachment pattern to respiratory tissues of various avian species, albeit with lower affinity than hemagglutinin, suggesting that other avian species might be susceptible for chicken CoV. When comparing tissue-specific binding patterns of various avian coronaviral S1 proteins on the single-species TMAs, chicken and partridge CoV S1 had predominant affinity for the trachea, while pigeon CoV S1 showed marked preference for lung of their respective hosts. Binding of all coronaviral S1 proteins was dependent on sialic acids; however, while chicken CoV S1 preferred sialic acids type I lactosamine (Gal(1-3)GlcNAc) over type II (Gal(1-4)GlcNAc), the fine glycan specificities of pigeon and partridge CoVs were different, as chicken CoV S1-specific sialylglycopolymers could not block their binding to tissues. Taken together, TMAs provide a novel platform in the field of infectious diseases to allow identification of binding specificities of viral attachment proteins and are helpful to gain insight into the susceptibility of host and organ for avian pathogens.","Ambepitiya Wickramasinghe, Iresha N.; de Vries, Robert P.; Eggert, Amber M.; Wandee, Nantaporn; de Haan, Cornelis A.

682926,Just-in-Time Simulation to Guide Workflow Design for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Difficult Airway Management,2020-06-08,"Background: Currently, adolescents grow up consuming a large amount of multimedia content and lead a sedentary lifestyle. As a result, emerging trends show greater feelings of loneliness. The present research seeks to describe adolescents’ attitudes towards Physical Education (PE), indices of loneliness and physical activity (PA) engagement. Further, it analyses associations between attitudes towards PE as a function of PA engagement and considers sex, loneliness and school year repetition as factors. Method: A sample of 2388 adolescents (43.3% males and 56.6% females) was recruited. Participants were aged 11–17 years (M = 13.8 years; SD = 1.2) and came from Spain. The following instruments were used: The Attitudes towards Physical Education questionnaire (AQPE) in order to analyze attitudes towards PE, and the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) loneliness scale to estimate loneliness. Results: With regard to sex and attitudes towards PE, significant differences were detected in relation to the difficulty of PE, with higher values being achieved in males (M = 2.4) than females (M = 2.3). A medium correlation emerged between the dimension of loneliness and the usefulness of PE (r = 0.323 **). Conclusions: It is confirmed that adolescents who experience greater levels of emotional or relational loneliness have less positive attitudes towards PE.","Padial-Ruz, Rosario; González-Campos, Gloria; Zurita-Ortega, Félix; Puga-González, M.

683617,Pediatric Resuscitation Practices During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020-07-06,"The evolution the novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) as a pandemic has inflicted several thousand deaths per day endangering the lives of millions of people across the globe. In addition to thermal scanning mechanisms, chest imaging examinations provide valuable insights to the detection of this virus, diagnosis and prognosis of the infections. Though Chest CT and Chest X-ray imaging are common in the clinical protocols of COVID-19 management, the latter is highly preferred, attributed to its simple image acquisition procedure and mobility of the imaging mechanism. However, Chest X-ray images are found to be less sensitive compared to Chest CT images in detecting infections in the early stages. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based framework to enhance the diagnostic values of these images for improved clinical outcomes. It is realized as a variant of the conventional SqueezeNet classifier with segmentation capabilities, which is trained with deep features extracted from the Chest X-ray images of a standard dataset for binary and multi class classification. The binary classifier achieves an accuracy of 99.53% in the discrimination of COVID-19 and Non COVID-19 images. Similarly, the multi class classifier performs classification of COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia and Normal cases with an accuracy of 99.79%. This model called the COVID-19 Super pixel SqueezNet (COVID-SSNet) performs super pixel segmentation of the activation maps to extract the regions of interest which carry perceptual image features and constructs an overlay of the Chest X-ray images with these regions. The proposed classifier model adds significant value to the Chest X-rays for an integral examination of the image features and the image regions influencing the classifier decisions to expedite the COVID-19 treatment regimen.","Prakash, N.B.; Murugappan, M.; Hemalakshmi, G.R.; Jayalakshmi, M.; Mahmud, Mufti",Sustain Cities Soc,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221067072100528X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.103252; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221067072100528X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34422549/,619

Individual clergy and congregations, across faith traditions, have been sources of misinformation and disinformation, promoting messages and actions that engender fear, animosity toward others, and unnecessary risk-taking. But there is a positive role for religion and faith-based institutions here, and many examples of leaders and organizations stepping up to contribute to the collective recovery. Personal faith and spirituality may be a source of host resistance and resilience. Religiously sponsored medical care institutions are vital to health care response efforts. Ministries and faith-based organizations are source of religious health assets that can help to meet community-wide needs. There is a pastoral role for clergy and laypeople who are instrumental in providing comfort and strength to the suffering and fearful in our midst. The outbreak presents an ethical challenge to all of us to step outside of our own preoccupations and to be present and of service for others. This includes having the courage to represent the highest values of our faith in speaking out against religiously motivated foolishness and hatred and in calling for political and public health leaders to be truthful and transparent in their messages to us.","Levin, Jeff",J Relig Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32488827/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-020-01048-x,619
