Overall, the parental generation steps in to help their children to a greater extent than the grandparental generation did. We explore four groups of young people; Voluntary Dependents, Gradual Progressors, Ambitious and Entrepreneurs. Categories are based on their current level of economic self-sufficiency as well as their desire to become so. The analysis illustrates distinct patterns with regard to parenting style, mechanisms of transmission as well as content of transmission between these four groups. Overall, in three of four groups we see that the parents are clearly facilitating the transition from school to work by providing primarily financial support, but this is also blocking the achievement of economic self-sufficiency.","Rainsford, Emily; Wambach, Anna",Intergenerational Transmission and Economic Self-Sufficiency,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981566/,802
171845,"The impact of Covid-19 on the slaughtering number of sacrificial animals in East Java, Indonesia",2021,"Purpose: Considering the benefits that gender diversity could bring to audit firms, especially in a time when the audit profession faces criticism and the COVID-19 pandemic has widened the gender inequality gap, this study aims to explore the lived experiences of female former audit managers from a social role theory and role congruity theory perspective, to understand the factors that contributed towards their resignations. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory qualitative research approach and an interpretative phenomenological analysis design were used. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior female audit managers who had resigned from Johannesburg Stock Exchange-accredited audit firms. Findings: The female former audit managers reported their unique experiences in terms of a lack of transparent career progression discussions, audit firms being run by “old boys’ clubs” and unfair treatment linked to bias, job overload and indistinct ambitions to become audit partners. Research limitations/implications: The homogeneous sample included a small number of female participants from a limited number of audit firms. Originality/value: The findings could inform audit firms how to address the factors contributing to female audit managers’ resignations and to challenge stereotypes to retain more women for promotion to audit partner-level, thereby capitalising on the benefits of a diversified management structure that could lead to higher quality audits and address gender inequality. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Groenewald, J.; Odendaal, E.",Gender in Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/gm-11-2020-0352,802
175777,"The impact of climate change on poverty in the pandemic of Covid-19 in Bengawan Solo Watershed, Wonogiri District, Central Java",2021,"This book captures ground-breaking attempts to utilise culture in territorial development and regeneration processes in the context of South Africa and our 'new normal' brought by COVID-19, the fourth industrial revolution, and climate change the world over. The importance of culture in rural-urban revitalisation has been underestimated in South Africa and the African continent at large. Despite some cultural initiatives that are still at developmental stages in big cities, such as Johannesburg, eThekwini and Cape Town, there is concern about the absence of sustainable policies and plans to support culture, creativity, and indigenous knowledge at national and municipal levels. Showcasing alternative strategies for making culture central to development, this book discusses opportunities to shift culture and indigenous knowledge from the peripheries and place them at the epicentre of sustainable development and the mainstream of cultural planning, which can then be applied in the contexts of Africa and the Global South. Governmental institutions, research councils, civil society organisations, private sector, and higher education institutions come together in a joint effort to explain the nexus between culture, economic development, rural-urban linkages, grassroots and technological innovations. Culture and Rural-Urban Revitalization in South Africa is an ideal read for those interested in rural and urban planning, cultural policy, indigenous knowledge and smart rural village model. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Mziwoxolo Sirayi, Modimowabarwa Kanyane and Giulio Verdini;individual chapters, the contributors.

Their complex and fragile nature has become even more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic review of news articles published globally between December 2019 and April 2020 was conducted to describe the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the chicken meat system and to identify key vulnerabilities and intervention points to build resilience. Most of the impacts identified were caused by a combination of the different mitigation measures implemented by the system actors such as movement restrictions rather than by the direct effects of the virus, thereby demonstrating the importance of interconnections and coordination in the system. Social media were found to have played a crucial role in amplifying, mitigating or mediating the impact of the pandemic. The findings highlight the importance of adopting a holistic approach that integrates the multiple dimensions of food systems for effective responses to systemic shocks.","Chapot, Lorraine Whatford Louise Compston Polly Tak Mehroosh Cuevas Soledad Garza Maria Bennani Houda Bin Aslam Hassaan Hennessey Mathew Limon Georgina Queenan Kevin Fournié Guillaume Dadios Nikolaos Häsler Barbara",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13169435,802
202139,Surviving from shocks of the COVID-19: adaptation strategies of the Sama Bajo Tiworo small scale fishers as a response to the crisis,2021,"BACKGROUND The concerns for hyperoxia-related brain tissue injury are well known to the medical community. The cerebro-vasodilatory properties of sevoflurane may create relative cerebral tissue ""hyperoxia"" during inhalational induction as compared to a propofol-based intravenous induction of anesthesia. STUDY OBJECTIVES The objective for this case series discussion was to identify any differences in cerebral tissue oxygenation secondary to induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane versus propofol. METHODS/STUDY PROCEDURES: After institutional review board approval, the computer data of tissue cerebral oximetry of pediatric patients (1-18 years age group) undergoing non-cardiac surgeries was comparatively analyzed for changes over time between the groups of children who received sevoflurane induction versus propofol induction of anesthesia. ""Hyperoxia"" (""hyperoxygenation"") was defined as significant percent changes from the baseline values as recorded in tissue cerebral oximetry. RESULTS In this case series, seven patients underwent inhalational (INH) induction with high concentrations (8%) sevoflurane with nitrous oxide in 33% oxygen and four patients underwent intravenous (i.v.) induction with 2 mg/kg propofol and nitrous oxide in 33% oxygen. As compared to propofol, significant cerebral tissue ""hyperoxia"" occurred with sevoflurane induction (p = 0.003). This did not resolve over time. CONCLUSION As compared to intravenous induction with propofol, inhalational induction with ""vasoparalytic"" sevoflurane ""hyperoxygenates"" developing brains. This observation requires validation in larger trials to conclude appropriate effect on our practice of pediatric anesthesia and pediatric patient safety under anesthesia.","Gupta, Deepak; Sangha, Jaspreet; Kaminski, Edward",Middle East journal of anaesthesiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23634569/,802

Here, we report a case of unexpected worsening of natalizumab-related progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy following COVID-19. After natalizumab discontinuation, a slight neurological improvement was observed, but, two months later the patient was admitted to the hospital because of neurological deterioration and COVID-19 mild pneumonia. Except for SARS-CoV-2 infection, no other potential factors of neurological worsening were identified. Thus, we pose the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 was instrumental in the progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy deterioration.","Borrelli, S; Dachy, B; Gazagnes, M-D; Du Pasquier, R",J Neurovirol,,802

351358,Zebrafish Embryos Immune System induction with BSA as an initial Screening model for Covid-19 Treatment,2021,"Italy was the first European country to be affected by COVID-19, facing an unprecedented situation. The reaction required drastic solutions and highly restrictive measures, which severely tested the trust of the Italian people. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the introduced measures was not only linked to political decisions, but also to the choice of the Italian people to trust and rely on institutions, accepting such necessary measures. In this context, the role of information sources was fundamental, since they strongly influence public opinion. The central focus of this research was to assess the information seeking behavior (ISB) of the Italian citizens, to understand how they related to information and how their specific use of information influenced public opinion. By making use of a survey addressed to 4260 Italian citizens, we identified extraordinarily virtuous behavior in the population: people strongly modified their ISB in order to address the most reliable sources. In particular, we found a very high reliance on scientists, which is particularly striking, if compared to the past. Moreover, starting from the survey results, we used social simulation to estimate the evolution of public opinion. Comparing the ISB during and before COVID-19, we discovered that the shift in the ISB, during the pandemic, may have actually positively influenced public opinion, facilitating the acceptance of the costly restrictions introduced.","Falcone, Rino; Sapienza, Alessandro",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,802

384937,Adaptation effort on dense residential areas to encounter COVID-19: A case study on urban area of Kalianyar in West Jakarta,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection in children can present with varied clinical phenotypes and understanding the pathogenesis is essential, to inform about the clinical trajectory and management. METHODS: We performed a multiplex immune assay analysis and compared the plasma biomarkers of Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS), acute COVID-19 infection (COVID-19), SARS-CoV-2 seropositive and control children admitted to a tertiary care children's hospital in Chennai, India. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors were correlated with SARS-CoV-2 clinical phenotypes. FINDINGS: PIMS-TS children had significantly elevated levels of cytokines, IFNÎ³, IL-2, TNF&#945;, IL-1&#945;, IFN&#945;, IFNß, IL-6, IL-15, IL-17A, GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-33 and IL-Ra; elevated chemokines, CCL2, CCL19, CCL20 and CXCL10 and elevated VEGF, Granzyme B and PDL-1 in comparison to COVID-19, seropositive and controls. COVID-19 children had elevated levels of IFNÎ³, IL-2, TNF&#945;, IL-1&#945;, IFN&#945;, IFNß, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-10, CCL2, CCL5, CCL11, CXCL10 and VEGF in comparison to seropositive and/or controls. Similarly, seropositive children had elevated levels of IFNÎ³, IL-2, IL-1&#945;, IFNß, IL-17A, IL-10, CCL5 and CXCL10 in comparison to control children. Plasma biomarkers in PIMS-TS and COVID-19 children showed a positive correlation with CRP and a negative correlation with the lymphocyte count and sodium levels. INTERPRETATION: We describe a comprehensive plasma biomarker profile of children with different clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection from a low- and middle-income country (LMIC) and observed that PIMS-TS is a distinct and unique immunopathogenic paediatric illness related to SARS-CoV-2 presenting with cytokine storm different from acute COVID-19 infection and other hyperinflammatory conditions.","Venkataraman, Aishwarya; Kumar, Nathella Pavan; Hanna, Luke Elizabeth; Putlibai, Sulochana; Karthick, M; Rajamanikam, Anuradha; Sadasivam, Kalaimaran; Sundaram, Balasubramanian; Babu, Subash",EBioMedicine,,802
400252,The shifting medium class consumption behavior era pandemic covid-19 of Jember district’s citizen,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The use of telemedicine (TM) has long been available, but recent restrictions to hospitals due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have accelerated the global implementation of TM. However, evidence on the effectiveness of this technology for the care of spine surgery patients is limited. In this systematic review the authors aimed to examine the current utilization of TM for spine surgery. METHODS: Using PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library, the authors performed a systematic review of the literature focused on the themes of telemedicine and spine surgery. Included in the search were randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-controlled studies. Two independent reviewers conducted the study appraisal, data abstraction, and quality assessments of the studies. RESULTS: Out of 1463 references from the initial search results, 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of TM interventions focused on improving perioperative patient communication and patient education by using mobile phone apps, online surveys, or online materials for consent. The studies reported the feasibility of the use of TM for perioperative care and positive user experiences from the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The current increase in TM adoption due to the COVID-19 crisis presents an opportunity to further develop and validate this technology. Early evidence in the literature supports the use of TM as an adjunct to traditional in-person clinical encounters for certain perioperative tasks such as supplemental patient education and postoperative surveys.","Kolcun, John Paul G; Ryu, Won Hyung A; Traynelis, Vincent C",J Neurosurg Spine,,802
477490,Livestock shortage amidst COVID-19: A case of Brunei Darussalam,2021,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious public health crisis worldwide. The symptoms of COVID-19 vary from mild to severe among different age groups, but the physiological changes related to COVID-19 are barely understood. METHODS: In the present study, a high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based lipidomic strategy was used to characterize the endogenous plasma lipids for cured COVID-19 patients with different ages and symptoms. These patients were further divided into two groups: those with severe symptoms or who were elderly and relatively young patients with mild symptoms. In addition, automated lipidomic identification and alignment was conducted by LipidSearch software. Multivariate and univariate analyses were used for differential comparison. RESULTS: Nearly 500 lipid compounds were identified in each cured COVID-19 group through LipidSearch software. At the level of lipid subclasses, patients with severe symptoms or elderly patients displayed dramatic changes in plasma lipidomic alterations, such as increased triglycerides and decreased cholesteryl esters (ChE). Some of these differential lipids might also have essential biological functions. Furthermore, the differential analysis of plasma lipids among groups was performed to provide potential prognostic indicators, and the change in signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Dyslipidemia was observed in cured COVID-19 patients due to the viral infection and medical treatment, and the discharged patients should continue to undergo consolidation therapy. This work provides valuable knowledge about plasma lipid markers and potential therapeutic targets of COVID-19 and essential resources for further research on the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Bai, Yunpeng; Huang, Wendong; Li, Yaocai; Lai, Changchun; Huang, Sumei; Wang, Guangwen; He, Yuemei; Hu, Linhui; Chen, Chunbo",Biosci. rep,,802
492769,Strategy to Reduce the Covid-19 Transmission through Adaptation of Greenship Interior Space (IS) Criteria,2021,"Patients with haemoglobin disorders, particularly β-thalassaemia or sickle cell disease (SCD) or combined forms, on account of their underlying disease pathology and associated (iron load mainly in the case of thalassaemia) co-morbidities are defined as high-risk individuals prone to develop more severe complications from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).

507142,"The Impact of Covid-19 on Millennial Perceptions of Experience Quality and Flow of Experience and Its Influence on Behavior Intention to Revisit a Nature and Rural Destination (Case on Jakarta, Indonesia)",2021,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic follows in its early stages an almost exponential expansion, with the number of cases as a function of time reasonably well fit by N(t) â e&#945;t, in many countries. We analyze the rate &#945; in different countries, starting in each country from a threshold of 30 total cases and fitting for the following 12 days, capturing thus the early exponential growth in a rather homogeneous way. We look for a link between the rate &#945; and the average temperature T of each country, in the month of the initial epidemic growth. We analyze a base set of 42 countries, which developed the epidemic at an earlier stage, an intermediate set of 88 countries and an extended set of 125 countries, which developed the epidemic more recently. Fitting with a linear behavior &#945;(T), we find increasing evidence in the three datasets for a slower spread at high T, at 99.66% C.L., 99.86% C.L. and 99.99995% C.L. (p-value 5â 10-7, or 5&#963; detection) in the base, intermediate and extended dataset, respectively. The doubling time at 25 °C is 40% ~ 50% longer than at 5 °C. Moreover we analyzed the possible existence of a bias: poor countries, typically located in warm regions, might have less intense testing. By excluding countries below a given GDP per capita from the dataset, we find that this affects our conclusions only slightly and only for the extended dataset. The significance always remains high, with a p-value of about 10-3 - 10-4 or less. Our findings give hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate should significantly decrease as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown policies. In general, policy measures should be taken to prevent a second wave, such as safe ventilation in public buildings, social distancing, use of masks, testing and tracking policies, before the arrival of the next cold season.","Notari, Alessio",Sci Total Environ,,802
519728,Research on the Evolution of Population Distribution and Influencing Factors in Xi’an During the COVID-19 Epidemic Control Period: Based on a Perspective of Multi-source Spatio-Temporal Big Data,2021,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted inadequacies in both national and international preparedness. The outbreak has resulted in an overburdening and incapacitation of health systems worldwide, as well as numerous deaths of individuals with comorbidities. We have performed a simulation study to examine the effect of comorbidities and their prevention on the clinical outcome and mortality of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data from past and present outbreaks indicate that individuals with comorbidities are significantly more susceptible to infections and yield poorer clinical outcomes. Our simulation study revealed that the prevention of morbidities like hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease bears an enormous potential to decrease the COVID-19 death toll. The accumulating evidence emphasizes our ability to reduce both the susceptibility of uninfected individuals to pathogenic factors, as well as the mortality of infected individuals during pandemics, by adopting a more comprehensive approach to disease prevention. Higher utilization of clinical preventive services is critical to reduce pandemic deaths and increase our preparedness for future outbreaks.","Agrawal, Siddarth; Golebiowska, Justyna; Bartoszewicz, Bartlomiej; Makuch, Sebastian; Mazur, Grzegorz",Prev Med Rep,,802
