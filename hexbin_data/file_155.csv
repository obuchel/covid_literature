333,333,333,Global Expression Profiling in Epileptogenesis: Does It Add to the Confusion?,13.53318,6.7495856,2010-01-11,"Since the inception of global gene expression profiling platforms in the mid-1990s, there has been a significant increase in publications of differentially expressed genes in the process of epileptogenesis. In particular for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, the presence of a latency period between the first manifestation of seizures to chronic epilepsy provides the opportunity for therapeutic interventions at the molecular biology level. Using global expression profiling techniques, approximately 2000 genes have been published demonstrating differential expression in mesial temporal epilepsy. The majority of these changes, however, are specific to laboratory or experimental conditions with only 53 genes demonstrating changes in more than two publications. To this end, we review the current status of gene expression profiling in epileptogenesis and suggest standard guidelines to be followed for greater accuracy and reproducibility of results.","Wang, Yi Yuen; Smith, Paul; Murphy, Michael; Cook, Mark",Brain Pathol,155,22

We focus on stochastic modeling that accounts for basic mechanisms of disease distribution and multi-sourced in situ uncertainties. Starting from the general formulation of population migration dynamics and the specification of transmission and recovery rates, the model studies the functional formulation of the evolution of the fractions of susceptible-infected-recovered individuals. The suggested approach is capable of: a) modeling population dynamics within and across localities, b) integrating the disease representation (i.e. susceptible-infected-recovered individuals) with observation time series at different geographical locations and other sources of information (e.g. hard and soft data, empirical relationships, secondary information), and c) generating predictions of disease spread and associated parameters in real time, while considering model and observation uncertainties. Key aspects of the proposed approach are illustrated by means of simulations (i.e. synthetic studies), and a real-world application using hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) data from China.","Angulo, Jose; Yu, Hwa-Lung; Langousis, Andrea; Kolovos, Alexander; Wang, Jinfeng; Madrid, Ana Esther; Christakos, George",PLoS One,155,17
1576,1576,1576,The role of viral persistence in flavivirus biology,13.646742,6.876442,2014-05-12,"In nature, vector-borne flaviviruses are persistently cycled between either the tick or mosquito vector and small mammals such as rodents, skunks, and swine. These viruses account for considerable human morbidity and mortality worldwide. Increasing and substantial evidence of viral persistence in humans, which includes the isolation of RNA by RT-PCR and infectious virus by culture, continues to be reported. Viral persistence can also be established in vitro in various human, animal, arachnid and insect cell lines in culture. Although some research has focused on the potential roles of defective virus particles, evasion of the immune response through the manipulation of autophagy and/or apoptosis, the precise mechanism of flavivirus persistence is still not well understood. We propose additional research for further understanding of how viral persistence is established in different systems. Avenues for additional studies include determining if the multifunctional flavivirus protein NS5 has a role in viral persistence, the development of relevant animal models of viral persistence as well as investigating the host responses that allow vector borne flavivirus replication without detrimental effects on infected cells. Such studies might shed more light on the viral-host relationships, and could be used to unravel the mechanisms for establishment of persistence.","Mlera, Luwanika; Melik, Wessam; Bloom, Marshall E.",Pathogens and Disease,155,17
1674,1674,1674,"Xyloketal B, a marine compound, acts on a network of molecular proteins and regulates the activity and expression of rat cytochrome P450 3a: a bioinformatic and animal study",13.3556595,7.1846085,2014-12-12,"Natural compounds are becoming popular for the treatment of illnesses and health promotion, but the mechanisms of action and safety profiles are often unknown. Xyloketal B (XKB) is a novel marine compound isolated from the mangrove fungus Xylaria sp., with potent antioxidative, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective effects. However, its molecular targets and effects on drug-metabolizing enzymes are unknown. This study aimed to investigate the potential molecular targets of XKB using bioinformatic approaches and to examine the effect of XKB on the expression and activity of rat cytochrome P450 3a (Cyp3a) subfamily members using midazolam as a model probe. DDI-CPI, a server that can predict drug–drug interactions via the chemical–protein interactome, was employed to predict the targets of XKB, and the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was used to analyze the pathways of the predicted targets of XKB. Homology modeling was performed using the Discovery Studio program 3.1. The activity and expression of rat hepatic Cyp3a were examined after the rats were treated with XKB at 7 and 14 mg/kg for 8 consecutive days. Rat plasma concentrations of midazolam and its metabolite 1′-OH-midazolam were determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Bioinformatic analysis showed that there were over 324 functional proteins and 61 related signaling pathways that were potentially regulated by XKB. A molecular docking study showed that XKB bound to the active site of human cytochrome P450 3A4 and rat Cyp3a2 homology model via the formation of hydrogen bonds. The in vivo study showed that oral administration of XKB at 14 mg/kg to rats for 8 days significantly increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of midazolam, with a concomitant decrease in the plasma clearance and AUC ratio of 1′-OH-midazolam over midazolam. Further, oral administration of 14 mg/kg XKB for 8 days markedly reduced the activity and expression of hepatic Cyp3a in rats. Taken together, the results show that XKB could regulate networks of molecular proteins and related signaling pathways and that XKB downregulated hepatic Cyp3a in rats. XKB might cause drug interactions through modulation of the activity and expression of Cyp3a members. More studies are warranted to confirm the mechanisms of action of XKB and to investigate the underlying mechanism for the regulating effect of XKB on Cyp3a subfamily members.","Su, Junhui; Chang, Cui; Xiang, Qi; Zhou, Zhi-Wei; Luo, Rong; Yang, Lun; He, Zhi-Xu; Yang, Hongtu; Li, Jianan; Bei, Yu; Xu, Jinmei; Zhang, Minjing; Zhang, Qihao; Su, Zhijian; Huang, Yadong; Pang, Jiyan; Zhou, Shu-Feng",Drug Des Devel Ther,155,1
1787,1787,1787,Phase 1 Study of Pandemic H1 DNA Vaccine in Healthy Adults,13.456655,6.803595,2015-04-17,"BACKGROUND: A novel, swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus was detected worldwide in April 2009, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global pandemic that June. DNA vaccine priming improves responses to inactivated influenza vaccines. We describe the rapid production and clinical evaluation of a DNA vaccine encoding the hemagglutinin protein of the 2009 pandemic A/California/04/2009(H1N1) influenza virus, accomplished nearly two months faster than production of A/California/07/2009(H1N1) licensed monovalent inactivated vaccine (MIV). METHODS: 20 subjects received three H1 DNA vaccinations (4 mg intramuscularly with Biojector) at 4-week intervals. Eighteen subjects received an optional boost when the licensed H1N1 MIV became available. The interval between the third H1 DNA injection and MIV boost was 3–17 weeks. Vaccine safety was assessed by clinical observation, laboratory parameters, and 7-day solicited reactogenicity. Antibody responses were assessed by ELISA, HAI and neutralization assays, and T cell responses by ELISpot and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Vaccinations were safe and well-tolerated. As evaluated by HAI, 6/20 developed positive responses at 4 weeks after third DNA injection and 13/18 at 4 weeks after MIV boost. Similar results were detected in neutralization assays. T cell responses were detected after DNA and MIV. The antibody responses were significantly amplified by the MIV boost, however, the boost did not increased T cell responses induced by DNA vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: H1 DNA vaccine was produced quickly, was well-tolerated, and had modest immunogenicity as a single agent. Other HA DNA prime-MIV boost regimens utilizing one DNA prime vaccination and longer boost intervals have shown significant immunogenicity. Rapid and large-scale production of HA DNA vaccines has the potential to contribute to an efficient response against future influenza pandemics.

2106,2106,2106,The social benefits of private infectious disease-risk mitigation,13.596648,6.931049,2015-04-17,"Does society benefit from private measures to mitigate infectious disease risks? Since mitigation reduces both peak prevalence and the number of people who fall ill, the answer might appear to be yes. But mitigation also prolongs epidemics and therefore the time susceptible people engage in activities to avoid infection. These avoidance activities come at a cost—in lost production or consumption, for example. Whether private mitigation yields net social benefits depends on the social weight given to the costs of illness and illness avoidance, now and into the future. We show that, for a large class of infectious diseases, private risk mitigation is socially beneficial. However, in cases where society discounts the future at either very low or very high rates relative to private individuals, or where it places a low weight on the private cost of illness, the social cost of illness under proportionate mixing (doing nothing) may be lower than the social cost of illness under preferential mixing (avoiding infectious individuals). That is, under some circumstances, society would prefer shorter, more intense epidemics without avoidance costs over longer, less intense epidemics with avoidance costs. A sobering (although not surprising) implication of this is that poorer societies should be expected to promote less private disease-risk mitigation than richer societies.","Morin, Benjamin R.; Perrings, Charles; Kinzig, Ann; Levin, Simon",Theor Ecol,155,17
2159,2159,2159,Anti-Inflammatory Action of Angiotensin 1-7 in Experimental Colitis,13.56646,7.194853,2016-03-10,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence to support a role for angiotensin (Ang) 1–7 in reducing the activity of inflammatory signaling molecules such as MAPK, PKC and SRC. Enhanced angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression has been observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suggesting a role in its pathogenesis, prompting this study. METHODS: The colonic expression/activity profile of ACE2, Ang 1–7, MAS1-receptor (MAS1-R), MAPK family and Akt were determined by western blot and immunofluorescence. The effect of either exogenous administration of Ang 1–7 or pharmacological inhibition of its function (by A779 treatment) was determined using the mouse dextran sulfate sodium model. RESULTS: Enhanced colonic expression of ACE2, Ang1-7 and MAS1-R was observed post-colitis induction. Daily Ang 1–7 treatment (0.01–0.06 mg/kg) resulted in significant amelioration of DSS-induced colitis. In contrast, daily administration of A779 significantly worsened features of colitis. Colitis-associated phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2 and Akt was reduced by Ang 1–7 treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate important anti-inflammatory actions of Ang 1–7 in the pathogenesis of IBD, which may provide a future therapeutic strategy to control the disease progression.","Khajah, Maitham A.; Fateel, Maryam M.; Ananthalakshmi, Kethireddy V.; Luqmani, Yunus A.",PLoS One,155,1

METHODS: Between October 2013 and December 2014, 276 patients with esophageal cancer in our department were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomized into two groups: FTS pathway group and conventional pathway group. The postoperative hospital stay, hospitalization expenditure, and postoperative complications were recorded. The markers of inflammatory and immune function were measured before operation as well as on the 1st, 3rd, and 7th postoperative days (POD), including serum level of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum globulin, immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin A (IgA) and lymphocyte subpopulations (CD3 lymphocytes, CD4 lymphocytes, CD8 lymphocytes and the CD4/CD8 ratio) in the patients between the two groups. RESULTS: In all, 260 patients completed the study: 128 in the FTS group and 132 in the conventional group. We found implementation of FTS pathway decreases postoperative length of stay and hospital charges (P < 0.05). In addition, inflammatory reactions, based on IL-6 and CRP levels, were less intense following FTS pathway compared to conventional pathway on POD1 and POD3 (P < 0.05). On POD1 and POD3, the levels of IgG, IgA, CD3 lymphocytes, CD4 lymphocytes and the CD4/CD8 ratio in FTS group were significantly higher than those in control group (All P < 0.05). However, there were no differences in the level of IgM and CD8 lymphocytes between the two groups.

A key feature of aging biology that may underlie these diseases is cellular senescence. Senescent cells accumulate in tissues with age, undergo widespread changes in gene expression, and typically demonstrate altered, pro-inflammatory profiles. Astrocyte senescence has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease, and to better understand senescence-associated changes in astrocytes, we investigated changes in their transcriptome using RNA sequencing. Senescence was induced in human fetal astrocytes by transient oxidative stress. Brain-expressed genes, including those involved in neuronal development and differentiation, were downregulated in senescent astrocytes. Remarkably, several genes indicative of astrocytic responses to injury were also downregulated, including glial fibrillary acidic protein and genes involved in the processing and presentation of antigens by major histocompatibility complex class II proteins, while pro-inflammatory genes were upregulated. Overall, our findings suggest that senescence-related changes in the function of astrocytes may impact the pathogenesis of age-related brain disorders.","Crowe, Elizabeth P.; Tuzer, Ferit; Gregory, Brian D.; Donahue, Greg; Gosai, Sager J.; Cohen, Justin; Leung, Yuk Y.; Yetkin, Emre; Nativio, Raffaella; Wang, Li-San; Sell, Christian; Bonini, Nancy M.; Berger, Shelley L.; Johnson, F.

However, recent advances in the field of RNA sequencing revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) add an extensive additional layer to the cell’s molecular network. Here, we performed transcriptome profiling throughout a primary HIV infection in vitro to investigate lncRNA expression at the different HIV replication cycle processes (reverse transcription, integration and particle production). Subsequently, guilt-by-association, transcription factor and co-expression analysis were performed to infer biological roles for the lncRNAs identified in the HIV-host interplay. Many lncRNAs were suggested to play a role in mechanisms relying on proteasomal and ubiquitination pathways, apoptosis, DNA damage responses and cell cycle regulation. Through transcription factor binding analysis, we found that lncRNAs display a distinct transcriptional regulation profile as compared to protein coding mRNAs, suggesting that mRNAs and lncRNAs are independently modulated. In addition, we identified five differentially expressed lncRNA-mRNA pairs with mRNA involvement in HIV pathogenesis with possible cis regulatory lncRNAs that control nearby mRNA expression and function. Altogether, the present study demonstrates that lncRNAs add a new dimension to the HIV-host interplay and should be further investigated as they may represent targets for controlling HIV replication.","Trypsteen, Wim; Mohammadi, Pejman; Van Hecke, Clarissa; Mestdagh, Pieter; Lefever, Steve; Saeys, Yvan; De Bleser, Pieter; Vandesompele, Jo; Ciuffi, Angela; Vandekerckhove, Linos; De Spiegelaere, Ward",Sci Rep,155,1

The conversion of Ang II to the septapeptide Ang-(1-7) is of particular interest as the latter also confers organ protection. The conversion is catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and other enzymes that selectively cleave the peptide bond between the proline and the phenylalanine at the carboxyl terminus of Ang II. The contribution of various enzyme activities that collectively lead to the formation of Ang-(1-7) from Ang II, in both normal conditions and in disease states, remains only partially understood. This is largely due to the lack of a reliable and sensitive method to detect these converting activities in complex samples, such as blood and tissues. Here, we report a fluorometric method to measure carboxypeptidase activities that cleave the proline-phenylalanine dipeptide bond in Ang II. This method is also suitable for measuring the conversion of apelin-13. The assay detects the release of phenylalanine amino acid in a reaction with the yeast enzyme of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL). When used in cell and mouse organs, the assay can robustly measure endogenous Ang II and apelin-13-converting activities involved in the renin-angiotensin and the apelinergic systems, respectively.","Liu, Pan; Wysocki, Jan; Serfozo, Peter; Ye, Minghao; Souma, Tomokazu; Batlle, Daniel; Jin, Jing",Sci Rep,155,1

This study compares detection rates, genotype distribution and viral loads of different enteric viral agents in HIV-1 seropositive (n = 200) and HIV-1 seronegative (n = 125) children hospitalized with DD in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Except for group A rotavirus (RVA), which were detected through enzyme immunoassay, the other enteric viruses (norovirus [NoV], astrovirus [HAstV], adenovirus [HAdV] and bocavirus [HBoV]) were detected through PCR or RT-PCR. A quantitative PCR was performed for RVA, NoV, HAstV, HAdV and HBoV. Infections with NoV (19% vs. 9.6%; p<0.001), HBoV (14% vs. 7.2%; p = 0.042) and HAdV (30.5% vs. 14.4%; p<0.001) were significantly more frequent among HIV-1 seropositive children. RVA was significantly less frequent among HIV-1 seropositive patients (6.5% vs. 20%; p<0.001). Similarly, frequency of infection with HAstV was lower among HIV-1 seropositive children (5.5% vs. 12.8%; p = 0.018). Among HIV-1 seropositive children 33 (16.5%) had co-infections, including three enteric viruses, such as NoV, HBoV and HAdV (n = 2) and NoV, HAstV and HAdV (n = 2). The frequency of infection with more than one virus was 17 (13.6%) in the HIV-1 negative group, triple infection (NoV + HAstV + HBoV) being observed in only one patient. The median viral load of HAstV in feces was significantly higher among HIV-1 positive children compared to HIV-1 negative children. Concerning children infected with RVA, NoV, HBoV and HAdV, no statistically significant differences were observed in the medians of viral loads in feces, comparing HIV-1 seropositive and HIV-1 seronegative children. Similar detection rates were observed for RVA, HAstV and HAdV, whilst NoV and HBoV were significantly more prevalent among children with CD4(+) T lymphocyte count below 200 cells/mm(3).

The best-fitting model entails a change in human activity regarding contacts not related to household and school. By using this model we estimate that the transmission distance sharply increased to 5.3 km (10 km when excluding infections linked to household and school transmission) during the second wave.

The objective of this study was to investigate molecular factors involved in the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of EPF in obese mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Male h ICR (Institute of Cancer Research) mice were fed a HFD containing or not containing the EPF (50 or 100 mg/kg) for eight weeks. EPF reduced body weight gain, lipid accumulation in livers and levels of lipid, glucose and insulin in plasma as well as reduced insulin resistance as compared with the HFD group. EPF significantly decreased serum aminotransferase activity of the HFD group. We observed that EPF administration significantly increased the level of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and prevented fat deposits in livers and HepG2 cells, but these effects were blocked by compound C (an AMPK inhibitor). The protective effects of EPF were probably associated with the decrease in HMGCR, SREBP-1c and FAS expressions and the increase in CPT1 and phosphor-IRS-1 expressions. Our results suggest that EPF might be a potential natural candidate for the treatment and/or prevention of overweight and hepatic and metabolic-related alterations induced by HFD.","Liu, Chanmin; Ma, Jieqiong; Sun, Jianmei; Cheng, Chao; Feng, Zhaojun; Jiang, Hong; Yang, Wei",Nutrients,155,1

Direct costs for patients (AOM) treated in outpatient setting included constant price paid for the examination and cost of prescribed antibiotics. Indirect costs included cost of work loss of parents and their transportation expenses. Data of 130 children with pneumococcal meningitis (n = 10), pneumonia (n = 53), and AOM (n = 67) were analyzed. The total median cost was €4,060.38 (direct cost: €3,346.38 and indirect cost: €829.18) for meningitis, €835.91 (direct cost: €480.66 and indirect cost: €330.09) for pneumonia, and €117.32 (direct cost: €17.59 and indirect cost: €99.73) for AOM.

We have previously demonstrated in the MIA mouse model that maternal administration of H(2) attenuates oxidative damage and neuroinflammation, including induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglial activation, in the fetal brain. Short-term memory, sociability and social novelty, and sensorimotor gating were evaluated using the Y-maze, three-chamber, and prepulse inhibition (PPI) tests, respectively, at postnatal 3 or 4 weeks. The number of neurons and oligodendrocytes was also analyzed at postnatal 5 weeks by immunohistochemical analysis. Offspring of the LPS-exposed dams showed deficits in short-term memory and social interaction, following neuronal and oligodendrocytic loss in the amygdala and cortex. Maternal H(2) administration markedly attenuated these LPS-induced abnormalities. Moreover, we evaluated the effect of H(2) on LPS-induced astrocytic activation, both in vivo and in vitro. The number of activated astrocytes with hypertrophic morphology was increased in LPS-exposed offspring, but decreased in the offspring of H(2)-administered dams. In primary cultured astrocytes, LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines were attenuated by H(2) administration. Overall, these findings indicate that maternal H(2) administration exerts neuroprotective effects and ameliorates MIA-induced neurodevelopmental deficits of offspring later in life.","Imai, Kenji; Kotani, Tomomi; Tsuda, Hiroyuki; Nakano, Tomoko; Ushida, Takafumi; Iwase, Akira; Nagai, Taku; Toyokuni, Shinya; Suzumura, Akio; Kikkawa, Fumitaka",Sci Rep,155,1

Here, we investigated the nutritional functions of preserved eggs by in vivo and in vitro experiments. The results of in vivo studies showed that the levels of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TCHO) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C/HDL-C) were significantly decreased (p<0.05) in the liver of rats treated with preserved eggs. Meanwhile, the levels of two important cancer markers, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), were also significantly decreased (p<0.05) in treated rats. In vitro studies were performed on Caco-2 cells, a human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line. It demonstrated that the gastrointestinal (GI) digests of preserved eggs significantly accelerated (p<0.05) the apoptosis by upregulating caspase-3 in the Caco-2 cells. Besides, after treated with preserved eggs, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of preserved eggs digests to Caco-2 cells was 5.75 mg/mL, indicating the significant inhibition of cell proliferation provided by preserved eggs (p<0.05). The results shown in this study demonstrated that preserved eggs may be a novel functional food involved with antilipemic, anti-inflammatory activity as well as the effect on accelarating the apoptosis of Caco-2 cells.","Mao, Changyi; Yu, Zhihui; Li, Chengliang; Jin, Yongguo; Ma, Meihu",Korean J Food Sci Anim Resour,155,1

We evaluated colonic structural, microbiomic and functional changes in old female vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops sabeus) and how age-related leaky gut alters responses to Western diet. We additionally assessed serum bovine immunoglobulin therapy to lower MT burden. MT was increased in old monkeys despite comparable histological appearance of the ascending colon. Microbiome profiles from 16S sequencing did not show large differences by age grouping, but there was evidence for higher mucosal bacterial loads using qPCR. Innate immune responses were increased in old monkeys consistent with higher MT burdens. Western diet challenge led to elevations in glycemic and hepatic biochemistry values only in old monkeys, and immunoglobulin therapy was not effective in reducing MT markers or improving metabolic health. We interpret these findings to suggest that ageing may lead to lower control over colonization at the mucosal surface, and reduced clearance of pathogens resulting in MT and inflammation. Leaky gut in ageing, which is not readily rescued by innate immune support with immunoglobulin, primes the liver for negative consequences of high fat, high sugar diets.","Wilson, Quentin N.; Wells, Magan; Davis, Ashley T.; Sherrill, Christina; Tsilimigras, Matthew C.

Methods: The synergistic activity and the bactericidal activity of colistin in combination with resveratrol was investigated by checkerboard assays and time-kill assays, respectively. A total of 21 strains were investigated, including 16 strains of different species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 6, Escherichia coli, n = 6; Citrobacter braakii, n = 1; Stenotrophomonas malthophilia, n = 1; Enterobacter cloaceae, n = 1; Acinetobacter baumannii, n = 1) with acquired colistin resistance, three colistin-susceptible K. pneumoniae precursors, and two strains of intrinsically colistin-resistant species (Serratia marcescens, n = 1; Proteus mirabilis, n = 1). Mechanisms of acquired colistin resistance included chromosomal mutations (i.e., mgrB, pmrAB) and plasmid genes (mcr-1, mcr-1.2). Results: Resveratrol did not show any significant intrinsic antimicrobial activity. Overall, a relevant synergistic antimicrobial activity of resveratrol in combination with colistin was observed with all tested strains, except for the three colistin-susceptible K. pneumoniae strains, and for two mcr-1-positive E. coli strains. In time-kill assays, performed with 15 selected strains, the combination of colistin 2 mg/L plus resveratrol 128 mg/L was bactericidal with 11 strains, and bacteriostatic for the remaining ones. Conclusions: Resveratrol was found to potentiate colistin activity against a wide panel of colistin-resistant strains, regardless of species and resistance mechanisms, which would deserve further investigation for potential clinical applications.","Cannatelli, Antonio; Principato, Silvia; Colavecchio, Olga L.; Pallecchi, Lucia; Rossolini, Gian Maria",Front Microbiol,155,1

In particular the mucus glycoproteins, or mucins, are responsible for the protective gel barrier. They are characterized by their high carbohydrate content, present in their variable number, tandem repeat domains. Throughout evolution the mucins have been maintained as integral components of the mucosal barrier, emphasizing their essential biological status. The glycosylation of the mucins is achieved through a series of biosynthetic pathways processes, which generate the wide range of glycans found in these molecules. Thus mucins are decorated with molecules having information in the form of a glycocode. The enteric microbiota interacts with the mucosal mucus barrier in a variety of ways in order to fulfill its many normal processes. How bacteria read the glycocode and link to normal and pathological processes is outlined in the review.","Corfield, Anthony P.",Microorganisms,155,11

Recent studies have shown that miR-451 regulates downstream molecules including AMPK/CAB39/MARK and mTOR to determine the balance between rapid proliferation and invasion in response to metabolic stress in the harsh tumor microenvironment. Surgical removal of the main tumor is inevitably followed by recurrence of the tumor due to inaccessibility of dispersed tumor cells in normal brain tissue. In order to address this complex process of cell proliferation and invasion and its response to conventional treatment, we propose a mathematical model that analyzes the intracellular dynamics of the miR-451-AMPK- mTOR-cell cycle signaling pathway within a cell. The model identifies a key mechanism underlying the molecular switches between proliferative phase and migratory phase in response to metabolic stress in response to fluctuating glucose levels. We show how up- or down-regulation of components in these pathways affects the key cellular decision to infiltrate or proliferate in a complex microenvironment in the absence and presence of time delays and stochastic noise. Glycosylated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the brain, contribute to the physical structure of the local brain microenvironment but also induce or inhibit glioma invasion by regulating the dynamics of the CSPG receptor LAR as well as the spatiotemporal activation status of resident astrocytes and tumor-associated microglia. Using a multi-scale mathematical model, we investigate a CSPG-induced switch between invasive and non-invasive tumors through the coordination of ECM-cell adhesion and dynamic changes in stromal cells. We show that the CSPG-rich microenvironment is associated with non-invasive tumor lesions through LAR-CSGAG binding while the absence of glycosylated CSPGs induce the critical glioma invasion. We illustrate how high molecular weight CSPGs can regulate the exodus of local reactive astrocytes from the main tumor lesion, leading to encapsulation of non-invasive tumor and inhibition of tumor invasion. These different CSPG conditions also change the spatial profiles of ramified and activated microglia. The complex distribution of CSPGs in the tumor microenvironment can determine the nonlinear invasion behaviors of glioma cells, which suggests the need for careful therapeutic strategies.","Kim, Yangjin; Kang, Hyunji; Powathil, Gibin; Kim, Hyeongi; Trucu, Dumitru; Lee, Wanho; Lawler, Sean; Chaplain, Mark",PLoS One,155,1

Patients do not only experience skeletal muscle degeneration, but also develop severe cardiomyopathy by their second decade, one of the main causes of death. The absence of dystrophin in the heart renders cardiomyocytes more sensitive to stretch-induced damage. Moreover, it pathologically alters intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) concentration, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) localization and mitochondrial function and leads to inflammation and necrosis, all contributing to the development of cardiomyopathy. Current therapies only treat symptoms and therefore the need for targeting the genetic defect is immense. Several preclinical therapies are undergoing development, including utrophin up-regulation, stop codon read-through therapy, viral gene therapy, cell-based therapy and exon skipping. Some of these therapies are undergoing clinical trials, but these have predominantly focused on skeletal muscle correction. However, improving skeletal muscle function without addressing cardiac aspects of the disease may aggravate cardiomyopathy and therefore it is essential that preclinical and clinical focus include improving heart function. This review consolidates what is known regarding molecular pathology of the DMD heart, specifically focusing on intracellular Ca(2+), nNOS and mitochondrial dysregulation. It briefly discusses the current treatment options and then elaborates on the preclinical therapeutic approaches currently under development to restore dystrophin thereby improving pathology, with a focus on the heart.","van Westering, Tirsa L.

Given early‐warning signals preceding the influenza outbreak, timely intervention such as vaccination and isolation management effectively decrease the morbidity. However, it is usually a difficult task to achieve the real‐time prediction of influenza outbreak due to its complexity intertwining both biological systems and social systems. By exploring rich dynamical and high‐dimensional information, our dynamic network marker/biomarker (DNM/DNB) method opens a new way to identify the tipping point prior to the catastrophic transition into an influenza pandemics. In order to detect the early‐warning signals before the influenza outbreak by applying DNM method, the historical information of clinic hospitalization caused by influenza infection between years 2009 and 2016 were extracted and assembled from public records of Tokyo and Hokkaido, Japan. The early‐warning signal, with an average of 4‐week window lead prior to each seasonal outbreak of influenza, was provided by DNM‐based on the hospitalization records, providing an opportunity to apply proactive strategies to prevent or delay the onset of influenza outbreak. Moreover, the study on the dynamical changes of hospitalization in local district networks unveils the influenza transmission dynamics or landscape in network level.","Chen, Pei; Chen, Ely; Chen, Luonan; Zhou, Xianghong Jasmine; Liu, Rui",J Cell Mol Med,155,8

Increased GFAP expression could be associated with the elevation in number of reactive astrocytes. IL-3 is involved in inflammation and ABDF1 intervenes normally in the transport across cell membranes and both were found up-regulated in APP/PS1 mice compared to Wild type mice. Furthermore, CCR5 expression was decreased and both CCL3 and CCL4 chemokines were highly expressed indicating a possible gliosis and probably an increase in chemotaxis from lymphocytes and T cell generation. We also noted for the first time, a CCR8 increase expression with diminution of its CCL1 chemokine, both normally involved in protection from bacterial infection and demyelination.

4027,4027,4027,Nucleolar and Ribosomal DNA Structure under Stress: Yeast Lessons for Aging and Cancer,13.485298,7.237338,2019-07-26,"Once thought a mere ribosome factory, the nucleolus has been viewed in recent years as an extremely sensitive gauge of diverse cellular stresses. Emerging concepts in nucleolar biology include the nucleolar stress response (NSR), whereby a series of cell insults have a special impact on the nucleolus. These insults include, among others, ultra-violet radiation (UV), nutrient deprivation, hypoxia and thermal stress. While these stresses might influence nucleolar biology directly or indirectly, other perturbances whose origin resides in the nucleolar biology also trigger nucleolar and systemic stress responses. Among the latter, we find mutations in nucleolar and ribosomal proteins, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing inhibitors and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription inhibition. The p53 protein also mediates NSR, leading ultimately to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence or differentiation. Hence, NSR is gaining importance in cancer biology. The nucleolar size and ribosome biogenesis, and how they connect with the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signalling pathway, are also becoming important in the biology of aging and cancer. Simple model organisms like the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, easy to manipulate genetically, are useful in order to study nucleolar and rDNA structure and their relationship with stress. In this review, we summarize the most important findings related to this topic.","Matos-Perdomo, Emiliano; Machín, Félix",Cells,155,1

G6PD-deficient cells have a reduced ability to induce the innate immune response, thus increasing host susceptibility to pathogen infections. An important part of the immune response is the activation of the inflammasome. G6PD-deficient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients and human monocytic (THP-1) cells were used as models to investigate whether G6PD modulates inflammasome activation. A decreased expression of IL-1β was observed in both G6PD-deficient PBMCs and PMA-primed G6PD-knockdown (G6PD-kd) THP-1 cells upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or LPS/nigericin stimulation. The pro-IL-1β expression of THP-1 cells was decreased by G6PD knockdown at the transcriptional and translational levels in an investigation of the expression of the inflammasome subunits. The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and downstream c-Fos expression were decreased upon G6PD knockdown, accompanied by decreased AP-1 translocation into the nucleus. Impaired inflammasome activation in G6PD-kd THP-1 cells was mediated by a decrease in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by NOX signaling, while treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) enhanced inflammasome activation in G6PD-kd THP-1 cells. G6PD knockdown decreased Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli clearance in G6PD-kd THP-1 cells and G6PD-deficient PBMCs following inflammasome activation. These findings support the notion that enhanced pathogen susceptibility in G6PD deficiency is, in part, due to an altered redox signaling, which adversely affects inflammasome activation and the bactericidal response.","Yen, Wei-Chen; Wu, Yi-Hsuan; Wu, Chih-Ching; Lin, Hsin-Ru; Stern, Arnold; Chen, Shih-Hsiang; Shu, Jwu-Ching; Tsun-Yee Chiu, Daniel",Redox Biol,155,1

Strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or carbapenemases are considered global priority pathogens for which new treatment and prevention strategies are urgently required, due to severely limited therapeutic options. South and Southeast Asia are major hubs for antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) K. pneumoniae and also for the characteristically antimicrobial-sensitive, community-acquired “hypervirulent” strains. The emergence of hypervirulent AMR strains and lack of data on exopolysaccharide diversity pose a challenge for K. pneumoniae BSI control strategies worldwide. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective genomic epidemiology study of 365 BSI K. pneumoniae from seven major healthcare facilities across South and Southeast Asia, extracting clinically relevant information (AMR, virulence, K and O antigen loci) using Kleborate, a K. pneumoniae-specific genomic typing tool. RESULTS: K. pneumoniae BSI isolates were highly diverse, comprising 120 multi-locus sequence types (STs) and 63 K-loci. ESBL and carbapenemase gene frequencies were 47% and 17%, respectively. The aerobactin synthesis locus (iuc), associated with hypervirulence, was detected in 28% of isolates. Importantly, 7% of isolates harboured iuc plus ESBL and/or carbapenemase genes. The latter represent genotypic AMR-virulence convergence, which is generally considered a rare phenomenon but was particularly common among South Asian BSI (17%). Of greatest concern, we identified seven novel plasmids carrying both iuc and AMR genes, raising the prospect of co-transfer of these phenotypes among K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: K. pneumoniae BSI in South and Southeast Asia are caused by different STs from those predominating in other regions, and with higher frequency of acquired virulence determinants. K. pneumoniae carrying both iuc and AMR genes were also detected at higher rates than have been reported elsewhere. The study demonstrates how genomics-based surveillance—reporting full molecular profiles including STs, AMR, virulence and serotype locus information—can help standardise comparisons between sites and identify regional differences in pathogen populations.

Segmental internodal primary demyelination was found in almost 90% of the dogs from 27 days post inoculation (DPI). Ultrastructurally demyelination was initiated by the insertion of CDV-infected astrocytic processes at nodes of Ranvier with subsequent cleavage of well-preserved myelin from the axolemma. CDV-infected macrophages were consistently involved in myelin phagocytosis. Some remyelination of denuded axons occurred after 35 DPI. Persistent productive infection of the choroid plexus and ependyma in the fourth ventricle was consistently associated with subependymal foci of demyelination. Primary demyelination occurred without detectable CDV-specific virus-neutralizing (CDV-VN) antibody in either serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). There were no immunoglobulin deposits or inflammatory cells within the lesions. These findings indicate that both direct CDV antibody-dependent and CDV antibody-dependent cell-mediated immune mechanisms of cytolysis or myelin destruction are not involved in the genesis of initial primary demyelination. The sequential morphologic and serologic findings in this model of demyelinating encephalomyelitis indicate that direct virus-induced injury has a major role in both the initiation and early progression of primary demyelination.,"Higgins, R.

Biobanking in public health presents a unique case study to unpack some of these issues in more detail. For example, there is a long history of using banked tissue obtained under clinical diagnostic conditions for later public health uses. But despite the collectivist approach of public health, the principles applied to the ethical challenges of biobanking (e.g. informed consent, autonomy, privacy) remain individualist.

The FMDV isolates seem to undergo reverse mutation or convergent evolution wherein sequences identical to the ancestors are present in the isolates in circulation. The eight vaccine strains included in the study were not related to each other and belonged to different genetic groups. Recombination was detected in the L(pro) region in one isolate (A IND 20/82) and in the VP1 coding 1D region in another isolate (A RAJ 21/96). Positive selection was identified at aa positions 23 in the L(pro) (P<0.05; 0.046*) and at aa 171 in the capsid protein VP1 (P<0.01; 0.003**).","Nagendrakumar, S. B.; Madhanmohan, M.; Rangarajan, P.

A key problem is the development of theory relating the dynamical processes of transmission to observable phenomena. In this paper, we consider compartmental susceptible–infectious–susceptible (SIS) and susceptible–infectious–recovered (SIR) models that are slowly forced through a critical transition. We derive expressions for the behavior of several candidate indicators, including the autocorrelation coefficient, variance, coefficient of variation, and power spectra of SIS and SIR epidemics during the approach to emergence or elimination. We validated these expressions using individual-based simulations. We further showed that moving-window estimates of these quantities may be used for anticipating critical transitions in infectious disease systems. Although leading indicators of elimination were highly predictive, we found the approach to emergence to be much more difficult to detect. It is hoped that these results, which show the anticipation of critical transitions in infectious disease systems to be theoretically possible, may be used to guide the construction of online algorithms for processing surveillance data.","O’Regan, Suzanne M.; Drake, John M.",Theor Ecol,155,1

Interactions between members of these communities often determine the state of the habitat in which they live. When these habitats include sites on the human body, these interactions can affect health and disease. Polymicrobial synergy can occur during infection, in which the combined effect of two or more microbes on disease is worse than seen with any of the individuals alone. Powerful genomic methods are increasingly used to study microbial communities, including metagenomics to reveal the members and genetic content of a community and metatranscriptomics to describe the activities of community members. Recent efforts focused toward a mechanistic understanding of these interactions have led to a better appreciation of the precise bases of polymicrobial synergy in communities containing bacteria, eukaryotic microbes, and/or viruses. These studies have benefited from advances in the development of in vivo models of polymicrobial infection and modern techniques to profile the spatial and chemical bases of intermicrobial communication. This review describes the breadth of mechanisms microbes use to interact in ways that impact pathogenesis and techniques to study polymicrobial communities.","Murray, Justine L.; Connell, Jodi L.; Stacy, Apollo; Turner, Keith H.; Whiteley, Marvin",J Microbiol,155,1

The true incidence was probably higher, since 9/26 of the diagnoses were made at autopsy. No BLPD was observed following autologous HSCT, so risk factor analyses were confined to the 1542 allogeneic HSCT. Factors assessed were HLA-mismatching (⩾1 antigen), T cell depletion (TCD), presence of acute GvHD (grades II–IV), donor type (related vs unrelated), age of recipient and donor, and underlying disease. Factors found to be statistically significant included patients transplanted for immune deficiency and CML, donor age ⩾18 years, TCD, and HLA-mismatching, with recipients of combined TCD and HLA-mismatched grafts having the highest incidence. Factors found to be statistically significant in a multiple regression analysis were TCD, donor age and immune deficiency, although 7/8 of the patients with immunodeficiencies and BLPD received a TCD graft from a haploidentical parent. The overall mortality was 92% (24/26). One patient had a spontaneous remission, but subsequently died >1 year later of chronic GVHD. Thirteen patients received therapy for BLPD. Three patients received lymphocyte infusions without response. The only patients with responses and long-term survival received alpha interferon αIFN). Of seven patients treated with αIFN there were four responses (one partial and three complete). These data demonstrate thatαIFN can be an effective agent against BLPD following HSCT, if a timely diagnosis is made.","Gross, TG; Steinbuch, M; DeFor, T; Shapiro, RS; McGlave, P; Ramsay, NKC; Wagner, JE; Filipovich, AH",Bone Marrow Transplant,155,1

METHODS: Excess age-specific mortality during periods of influenza activity was evaluated in Israel during the period 1999–2006 for three death categories. For each respiratory year, the lowest monthly moving average for the mortality rate was subtracted from each month in the period of influenza activity. Average mortality rates in years with minimal influenza activity were deducted from corresponding months to exclude winter mortality unrelated to influenza. The sums of these results were used as estimates of excess mortality rates. RESULTS: Overall excess mortality rates ranged from 7.7 to 36.1 per 100,000 for all causes, and from 4.4 to 24.4 per 100,000 for respiratory and circulatory causes. Influenza was associated with an average of 869 (range 280–1,516) deaths annually from respiratory and circulatory diseases during seasons with significant influenza activity. About 90% of the influenza-associated mortality from respiratory and circulatory diseases was in the age group 65+ years and about 1% in the age group <50 years. The age group <50 years accounted for an annual average of seven deaths from respiratory and circulatory diseases. CONCLUSION: Annual mortality associated with seasonal influenza is highly variable. Under the age of 50 years, there is minimal seasonal influenza associated mortality. This information provides an important baseline for evaluating the severity of the A(H1N1) 2009 influenza pandemic, where persons under 50 years of age were often disproportionately represented.","Linhart, Y.; Shohat, T.; Bromberg, M.; Mendelson, E.; Dictiar, R.; Green, M.

In the preparations derived from human leucocytes or cultured B lymphoblastoid cells, which are in routine clinical use, mixtures of a number of distinct subtypes of human IFNα have been identified. There are also 3 slightly different verrions of the same single subtype, IFNα-2, made by recombinant DNA procedures in bacteria. IFNα preparations are injected intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Dose-related side effects are common but usually tolerable, but prolonged treatment may cause increasing fatigue and depression. Some patients form neutralising antibodies which block the effects of the IFN; these appear to be relatively more common after recombinant IFNα-2 than after IFN derived from human cells. Given intranasally, IFTα can prevent a subsequent experimental rhinovirus infection, or the spread of natural colds within a family. Repeated administration progressively damages the nasal mucosa, so that long term prophylaxis is not possible. IFNα has proved useful in patients with papillomavirus warts of the larynx, ano-genital region (condyloma acuminata) and skin (common warts). Treatment regimens remain to be optimised and are likely to include surgery or other treatments. IFNα and zidovudine (azidothymidine) synergistically inhibit the growth of HIV in vitro, and combination are on trial in patients with early AIDS. Very large doses of IFNα are effective against Kaposi’s sarcoma in some AIDS patients. In chronic hepatitis B, continuing virus replication may lead to cirrhosis or primary liver cancer. Earlier clinical trials with IFNα gave inconclusive results, but recent large studies have confirmed that 25 to 40% of patients obtain benefit; this probably results from both the antiviral and the immunomodulatory effects of IFNα. In patients with chronic hepatitis C, the biochemical markers usually improve rapidly during IFNα administration, but relapse if treatment is stopped after only a few months; to increase the chances of sustained cure, the treatment period is now being prolonged.","Finter, N.

While the degree and area of burn together constitute a reliable numerical measure of cutaneous injury due to heat, as yet no satisfactory measure of inhalation injury has been developed. In this study, we employed technetium-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) radioaerosol lung scintigraphy (inhalation scan) to evaluate acute inhalation injury in fire victims. Ten normal controls and 17 survivors from a fire accident were enrolled in the study. All patients suffered from respiratory symptoms (dyspnoea and/or cough with sputum).(99m)Tc-DTPA aerosol inhalation lung scintigraphy was performed in all subjects, using a commercial lung aerosol delivery unit. The degree of lung damage was presented as the clearance rate (k; %/min) calculated from the time-activity curve over the right lungs. In addition, the distribution pattern of the radioactivity in the lungs was evaluated and classified into two groups: homogeneous distribution and inhomogeneous distribution. A plain chest radiograph (CxR) and pulmonary function test (PFT) were performed in the same group of patients. The results showed that 6/17 (35.3%) opatients had inhomogeneous distribution of radioactivity in their inhalation scans, and 11/17 (64,7%) had homogeneous scans. Five of the six patients with inhomogeneous scans were admitted for further management, and all patients with homogeneous scans were discharged from the emergency department and needed no further intensive care. The clearance rates of the right lung were 0.73%±0.13%/min from normal controls and 1.54%±0.58%/min for fire victims. The difference was significant, with aP value of less than 0.01. Using a cut-off value of 0.9%/min (all normal subjects were below 0.9%/min) 14 (82.4%) patients had abnormal clearance rates of(99m)Tc-DTPA from the lung. In contrast, only three (17.6%) patients had abnormal CxR and three (17.6%) had abnormal PFTs. We conclude that (1) conventional CxR and PFT are not good modalities for evaluating inhalation injury in fire victims because of their low sensitivity, and (2)(99m)Tc-DTPA radioaerosol inhalation scintigraphy can provide an objective evaluation of inhalation injury during a fire accident and may be useful in therapeutic decision-making and disease monitoring.","Lin, Wan-Yu; Kao, Chia-Hung; Wang, Shyh-Jen",Eur J Nucl Med,155,1

Eligible for participation in this study were patients who developed candidemia during their ICU stay. Patients under antifungal therapy and with a confirmed systemic fungal infection prior to the diagnosis of candidemia were excluded. Cultures of blood, urine, and stool were performed for all patients in the study, and all patients underwent endoscopy/biopsy of the esophagus for detection of Candida. Smears and/or scrapings of oropharyngeal and esophageal lesions were examined for hyphae and/or pseudohyphae and were also cultured for yeasts.

Total parenteral nutrition was more common in IC than in NIC patients (9/9 [100%] vs 8/15 [53%], p = 0.02). Oropharyngeal candidiasis was detected in 5 of 9 (55.5%) IC patients and in 1 of 15 (6.5%) NIC patients (p = 0.015).

CD4/CD8(+) ratio was 1.9 on day 28 after alloBSCT, then gradually declined to 0.8 at 1 year due to more rapid CD8(+) cell recovery. Mean phytohemagglutinin-induced T cell responses were lower than normal on day +28 (P < 0.05), then tended to recover towards normal values. Natural-killer cytotoxicity remained low from day +28 to 1 year post-alloBSCT, but considerable lymphokine-activated killer cytotoxicity was induced from cells already obtained on day +28. Faster lymphocyte recovery correlated with better survival in alloBSCT patients (median follow-up 287 days, P = 0.002), ALC recovery was not affected by acute GVHD, CMV infections or doses of infused cells. ALC recovery did not correlate with survival in either historical alloBMT group. These data suggest that after alloBSCT lymphocyte reconstitution is faster than after alloBMT, and that quicker lymphocyte recovery predicts better survival in the alloBSCT setting.","Pavletic, ZS; Joshi, SS; Pirruccello, SJ; Tarantolo, SR; Kollath, J; Reed, EC; Bierman, PJ; Vose, JM; Warkentin, PI; Gross, TG; Nasrati, K; Armitage, JO; Kessinger, A; Bishop, MR",Bone Marrow Transplant,155,1

A monoclonal antibody with a high affinity against an oocyst antigen was used to set up the test. The efficiency of this assay was compared with that of the flotation test; 275 calf faecal samples were examined by the two methods. There was 96% agreement between the two tests. For the 11 conflicting samples, the two tests were repeated and a modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining was performed on faecal smears. All these 11 samples contained few oocysts, but only five and six of them were shown to be positive by the ELISA and flotation tests, respectively. The degree of sensitivity of the ELISA and flotation tests is comparable; samples heavily or moderately contaminated with oocysts are detected by both methods. This ELISA is reliable and never gives rise to false positive results. Nevertheless, as with the flotation test, the occasional case containing very few oocysts will not always be detected by this test. If necessary, very accurate diagnosis can be made by a staining technique or by a direct immunofluorescent assay. In veterinary medicine, the ELISA seems to be a method of choice; it appears to be a fast and reliable technique which could be used as a routine test for the detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts. Nevertheless the degree of sensitivity must always be borne in mind. There is no need for a microscopic examination, which is an additional advantage.","Robert, B.; Ginter, A.; Antoine, H.; Collard, A.; Coppe, P.",Vet Parasitol,155,1

Attachment is followed by a redistribution or capping of virus particles on the cell surface which may play a role in the uptake process. Certain viruses penetrate the plasma membrane directly but many, both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, are endocytosed at coated pits and subsequently pass into endosomes. The low pH environment of the endosome facilitates passage of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. For some viruses the mechanism of membrane penetration is now known to be linked to a pH-mediated conformational change in external virion proteins. As a consequence of infection there are alterations in the permeability of the plasma membrane which may contribute to cellular damage.

Pronounced differences have been observed in the interactions between the virus and cell surfaces, suggesting that influenza C virus attaches to the receptors different from those recognized by other myxoviruses. While influenza A and B viruses agglutinate erythrocytes from many species, including humans, the spectrum of erythrocytes agglutinated by influenza C virus is much more restricted. Erythrocytes from rats, mice, and adult chickens are suitable for hemagglutination and hemadsorption tests; cells from other species, however, react not at all or only poorly with influenza C virus. Differences are also observed so far as hemagglutination inhibitors are concerned. A variety of glycoproteins have been shown to prevent influenza A and B viruses from agglutinating erythrocytes. In the case of influenza C virus, rat serum was for a long time the only known hemagglutination inhibitor. A difference in the receptors for influenza C virus and other myxo-viruses was also suggested by studies on the receptor-destroying enzyme. The ability of influenza C virus to inactivate its own receptors was reported soon after the first isolation of this virus from a patient. However, the influenza C enzyme did not affect the receptors of other myxoviruses and, conversely, the receptor-destroying enzyme of either of the latter viruses was unable to inactivate the receptors for influenza C virus on erythrocytes. While the enzyme of influenza A and B virus was characterized as a neuraminidase in the 1950s, even with refined methodology no such activity was detectable with influenza C virus. It is now known that both the receptor-binding and receptor-destroying activities, as well as the fusion activity of influenza C virus are mediated by the only glycoprotein present on the surface of the virus particle. The structure and functions of this protein, which is designated as HEF, are reviewed in this chapter.","Herrler, Georg; Klenk, Hans-Dieter",Adv Virus Res,155,1

Serine peptidases are found in viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotes. They include exopeptidases, endopeptidases, oligopeptidases, and omega peptidases. On the basis of three-dimensional structures, most of the serine peptidase families can be grouped together into about six clans that may have common ancestors. The structures are known for members of four of the clans, chymotrypsin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidase C, and Escherichia D-Ala-D-Ala peptidase A. The peptidases of chymotrypsin, subtilisin, and carboxypeptidase C clans have a common “catalytic triad” of three amino acids—namely, serine (nucleophile), aspartate (electrophile), and histidine (base). The geometric orientations of these are closely similar between families; however the protein folds are quite different. The arrangements of the catalytic residues in the linear sequences of members of the various families commonly reflect their relationships at the clan level. The members of the chymotrypsin family are almost entirely confined to animals. 10 families are included in chymotrypsin clan (SA), and all the active members of these families are endopeptidases. The order of catalytic residues in the polypeptide chain in clan SA is His/Asp/Ser.","Rawlings, Neil D.; Barrett, Alan J.",Methods Enzymol,155,17

Morpholinos are typically used to inhibit translation of mRNA, splicing of pre‐mRNA, and maturation of miRNA, although they can also inhibit other interactions between biological macromolecules and RNA. Morpholinos are effective, specific, and lack non‐antisense effects. They work in any cell that transcribes and translates RNA. However, unmodified Morpholinos do not pass well through plasma membranes and must therefore be delivered into the nuclear or cytosolic compartment to be effective. Morpholinos form stable base pairs with complementary nucleic acid sequences but apparently do not bind to proteins to a significant extent. They are not recognized by proteins and do not undergo protein‐mediated catalysis; nor do they mediate RNA cleavage by RNase H or the RISC complex.

Study Design: The authors conducted a single‐blind, prospective, cross‐sectional study. Methods: Patients with sinus disease and a control group without sinus disease were enrolled in the study. A disease‐specific, validated Sinonasal Outcomes Test survey (SNOT‐20) was completed by the subjects and a generalized validated Medical Outcomes Short Form 36 Survey (SF‐36) was also completed. An endoscopically guided brush sampling of nasal mucous was obtained from the middle meatus. Fungal specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) was performed on the obtained sample to identify one of 82 different species of fungus in the laboratory. Statistical analysis was used to categorize the recovered fungal DNA and to crossreference this information with the outcomes surveys. Results: The fungal recovery rate in the study was 45.9% in patients with sinus disease and 45.9% in control subjects. Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis had a mean SNOT‐20 score of 1.80 versus the control group mean score of 0.77 (P < .0001). SF‐36 data similarly showed a statistically significant difference between diseased and control populations with controls scoring a mean of 80.37 and patients with chronic rhinosinusitis scoring a mean of 69.35 for a P value of .02. However, no statistical significance could be ascribed to the presence or absence of fungi recovered, the type of fungi recovered, or the possible impact of fungi on the quality‐of‐life survey results. Conclusion: The recovery rate of fungi from the middle meatus of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and a control population without chronic rhinosinusitis is 45.9% using QPCR techniques. No direct causation with regard to fungal species or presence was proven; however, a species grouping for future studies is proposed based on trends in this data and other reports. Disease‐specific outcomes surveys revealed a statistically significant difference between the two groups.","Murr, Andrew H.; Goldberg, Andrew N.; Vesper, Stephen",Laryngoscope,155,22

Of 54 volunteers inoculated with 100 TCID(50) of human rhinovirus type 2 (HRV‐2), 50 (96.6%) and 32 (59%) excreted antigen and virus on at least 1 of 3 days investigated, respectively. Thirty‐three (61%) had significant rises in rhinovirus‐specific IgA by ELISA. Twelve (22%) developed symptoms of colds. Generally the ELISA detected antigen more frequently in volunteers later in the course of infection and provided evidence of infection in a higher proportion of asymptomatic compared with symptomatic volunteers. On the other hand, virus isolation detected virus more frequently earlier in the course of infection and in a higher proportion of symptomatic compared with asymptomatic volunteers. We conclude that rhinovirus antigen detection by ELISA is a simple, rapid, sensitive, and practical test to diagnose a rhinovirus infection and potentially a viable alternative to virus isolation.","Al‐Nakib, W.; Dearden, C.

Co‐circulating respiratory viruses may obscure the determination of influenza activity. DESIGN: Prospective clinical surveillance for the new onset of respiratory illness followed by viral cultures during seven separate influenza seasons. SETTING: The Wisconsin Veterans Home, a skilled nursing facility for veterans and their spouses. RESULTS: Influenza A isolates were encountered in greater numbers than non‐influenza A isolates during three seasons. Seasonal variability is striking. In December 1992, we identified a large outbreak of respiratory illness. Influenza type B was cultured from 102 residents. In December 1995, influenza A was cultured from 285 people in Wisconsin. At that time, we identified outbreaks of respiratory illness in two of our four buildings. Based on statewide data, we suspected an influenza outbreak; however, 26 isolates of parainfluenza virus type 1 were cultured with no influenza. The potential importance of culturing at the end of the season was demonstrated in 1991–1992 when an outbreak of respiratory syn‐cytial virus (RSV) overlapped and extended beyond influenza A activity. CONCLUSIONS: When interpreting new clinical respiratory illnesses as a basis for declaring an outbreak of influenza A, clinicians should realize that co‐circulating respiratory viruses can account for clinical illnesses. Clinicians might utilize healthcare dollars efficiently by performing cultures to focus the timing of influenza A chemoprophylaxis. Cultures could be performed when clinical outbreak criteria are approached to confirm an outbreak. Culturing of new respiratory illness could begin again before the anticipated discontinuation of prophylaxis (approximately 2 weeks).

It is very important to identify novel biomarkers to predict therapeutic response and outcome of TNBC. We investigated the association between polymorphisms in PARP1 gene and clinicopathological characteristics or survival of 272 patients with stage I-III primary TNBC treated with anthracycline/taxane based adjuvant chemotherapy. We found that after adjusted by age, grade, tumor size, lymph node status and vascular invasion, rs7531668 TA genotype carriers had significantly better DFS rate than TT genotype carriers, the 5 y DFS was 79.3% and 69.2% (P = 0.046, HR 0.526 95% CI 0.280–0.990). In lymph node negative subgroup, DFS of rs6664761 CC genotype carriers was much better than TT genotype carriers (P = 0.016, HR 0.261 95% CI 0.088–0.778) and DFS of rs7531668 AA genotype carriers was shorter than TT genotype carriers (P = 0.015, HR 3.361 95% CI 1.259–8.969). In subgroup of age ≤ 50, rs6664761 TC genotype predicted favorable DFS than TT genotype (P = 0.042, HR 0.405 95% CI 0.170–0.967). Polymorphisms in PARP1 gene had no influence on treatment toxicities.

The Agence de la Biomédecine authorized us to procure fresh corneas targeted for research, only from the donors with medical contraindications for transplantation, in order not to increase grafts shortage. Three nurses from the hospital coordination team of Saint-Etienne University Hospital, obtained consent for research and transplantation in parallel, screening all intra-hospital deaths cases, following standard protocol to check no refusal from families, despite the French opt-out system. They contacted 127 families for research and 244 for transplantation, in 71% of cases by telephone. Consent was obtained in 62% of cases for research and 54% for transplantation (P = 0.135). The main contraindication for transplantation was the cognitive disorders (66%) followed by the blood cancers (8%). This new specific activity, providing new source of fresh corneas for research immediately usable without any eyebank storage steps, didn’t reduce the number of corneas procured for transplantation versus previous years (P = 0.998). Donors in the research group were 10 years older (P<0.001) without difference regarding endothelial cell quality (P = 0.071), allowing maximal clinical relevance for protocols using these fresh human scientific corneas provided by targeted donation.","Garcin, Thibaud; Pugniet, Jean Loup; Peyragrosse, Thierry; Rogues, Francoise; Acquart, Sophie; Cognasse, Fabrice; Thuret, Gilles; Gain, Philippe",PLoS One,155,33

The absence of a vaccine has determined the search for antiviral drugs with the capacity to inhibit the replication of the new virus. Among them, remdesivir, an analogue of adenosine, is what seems to have a more promising future. This drug has shown in vitro and in animals a high capacity to block infection and viral replication with attainable concentrations in human plasma. Although all studies have been carried out with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it seems that by virological and functional analogy, remdesivir is one of the few antiviral drugs with proven efficacy.

The virus is believed to have emerged from a reassortment event involving a swine virus some time in the past 10 to 20 years, but pigs, pork, and pork products have not been involved with infection or spread of the virus to or among people. Because countries quickly implemented recently developed pandemic influenza plans, the disease was detected and reported and public health authorities instituted control measures in a timely fashion. But the news media's unfortunate and inappropriate naming of the disease as the “swine flu” led to a drop in the demand for pork and several countries banned pork imports from affected countries, resulting in serious negative economic impacts on the pork industry. With the continual circulation and interspecies transmission of human, swine, and avian influenza viruses in countries around the world, there are calls for strengthening influenza surveillance in pigs, birds, and other animals to aid in monitoring and assessing the risk of future pandemic virus emergence involving different species. We identify and discuss several lessons to be learned from pandemic H1N1 2009 from a One Health perspective, as stronger collaboration among human, animal, and environmental health sectors is necessary to more effectively prevent or detect and respond to influenza pandemics and thus improve human, animal, and environmental health and well-being.","Pappaioanou, Marguerite; Gramer, Marie",ILAR J,155,1

However, in patients undergoing abdominal surgery, the supine position increases abdominal wall tension, especially during coughing and deep breathing, which may aggravate pain and lead to abdominal wound dehiscence. The semi-Fowler’s position may reduce abdominal wall tension, but its safety and comfort in tracheal extubation have not been reported. We aimed to evaluate the safety and comfort of different extubation positions in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. METHODS: We enrolled 141 patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists grade of I-III who underwent abdominal surgery. All patients were anesthetized with propofol, fentanyl, cisatracurium, and sevoflurane. After surgery, all patients were transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Patients were then randomly put into the semi-Fowler’s (n = 70) or supine (n = 71) position while 100% oxygen was administered. The endotracheal tube was removed after the patients opened their eyes and regained consciousness. Vital signs, coughing, and pain and comfort scores before and/or after extubation were recorded until the patients left the PACU. RESULTS: In comparison with the supine position, the semi-Fowler’s position significantly decreased the wound pain scores at all intervals after extubation (3.51 ± 2.50 vs. 4.58 ± 2.26, 2.23 ± 1.68 vs. 3.11 ± 2.00, 1.81 ± 1.32 vs. 2.59 ± 1.88, P = 0.009, 0.005 and 0.005, respectively), reduced severe coughing (8[11.43%] vs. 21[29.58%], P = 0.008) and bucking after extubation (3[4.29%] vs. 18[25.35%], P < 0.001), and improved the comfort scores 5 min after extubation (6.11 ± 2.30 vs. 5.17 ± 1.78, P = 0.007) and when leaving from post-anesthesia care unit (7.17 ± 2.27 vs. 6.44 ± 1.79, P = 0.034). The incidences of vomiting, emergence agitation, and respiratory complications were of no significant difference. CONCLUSION: Tracheal extubation in the semi-Fowler’s position is associated with less coughing, sputum suction, and pain, and more comfort, without specific adverse effects when compared to the conventional supine position.

However, EMA treatment was not effective in primary clarifier and secondary trickling filter effluents where turbidities were ≥10 NTU. In viable pure cultures, rapidly dividing and senescent cells were most affected by increasing EMA concentrations. Amplification of heat-killed pure bacterial cultures decreased 4 to 6 logs depending on EMA concentration and culture age. The greatest difference was observed in 5-h cultures using 7.5 μg/ml EMA. Turbidity (≥100 NTU) in environmental samples inhibited EMA effectiveness on viability discrimination. Enumeration of E. coli in certain wastewaters using EMA-qPCR was similar to culture suggesting that EMA treatment could be incorporated into qPCR assays for the quantification of viable bacteria increasing assay time no more than 30 min. Our results indicate that EMA can be used in routine qPCR assays, but optimum conditions for exposure must be identified for each sample type due to sample matrix effects such as turbidity.","Gedalanga, Phillip B.; Olson, Betty H.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,155,1

As there are numerous NMR-derived methods applicable to probe protein–ligand interactions, NMR has been widely utilized in drug discovery, especially in such steps as hit identification and lead optimization. NMR is frequently used to locate ligand-binding sites on a target protein and to determine ligand binding modes. NMR spectroscopy is also a unique tool in fragment-based drug design (FBDD), as it is able to investigate target-ligand interactions with diverse binding affinities. NMR spectroscopy is able to identify fragments that bind weakly to a target, making it valuable for identifying hits targeting undruggable sites. In this review, we summarize the roles of solution NMR spectroscopy in drug discovery. We describe some methods that are used in identifying fragments, understanding the mechanism of action for a ligand, and monitoring the conformational changes of a target induced by ligand binding.

Here, we used ex vivo stimulation of memory T cells and screening of naive and memory T cell libraries, combined with T cell cloning and TCR sequencing, to dissect the human naive and memory CD4(+) T cell repertoire against the influenza pandemic H1 hemagglutinin (H1-HA). We found that naive CD4(+) T cells have a broad repertoire, being able to recognize naturally processed as well as cryptic peptides spanning the whole H1-HA sequence. In contrast, memory Th cells were primarily directed against just a few immunodominant peptides that were readily detected by mass spectrometry–based MHC-II peptidomics and predicted by structural accessibility analysis. Collectively, these findings reveal the presence of a broad repertoire of naive T cells specific for cryptic H1-HA peptides and demonstrate that antigen processing represents a major constraint determining immunodominance.","Cassotta, Antonino; Paparoditis, Philipp; Geiger, Roger; Mettu, Ramgopal R.; Landry, Samuel J.; Donati, Alessia; Benevento, Marco; Foglierini, Mathilde; Lewis, David J.M.; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Sallusto, Federica",J Exp Med,155,22

Analyzing data of 10,560 Facebook users, we find that individuals who are more authentic in their self-expression also report greater Life Satisfaction. This effect appears consistent across different personality profiles, countering the proposition that individuals with socially desirable personalities benefit from authentic self-expression more than others. We extend this finding in a pre-registered, longitudinal experiment, demonstrating the causal relationship between authentic posting and positive affect and mood on a within-person level.

Specifically, the effect of the mesoporosity and the acidity of the y zeolite as a support has been explored. Mesoporous were generated on Y zeolite by treatment with NH4F and the acidity was neutralized by Na incorporation. Four cobalt catalysts supported on Y zeolite have been prepared, two using Y zeolite without mesoporous (Co/Y, Co/Y-Na), and two using Y zeolite with mesoporous (Co/Y-mod and Co/Y-mod-Na). All catalysts showed a high activity, with ethanol conversion values close to 100%. The main differences were found in the distribution of the reaction products. Co/Y and Co/Y-mod catalysts showed high selectivity to ethylene and low hydrogen production, which was explained by their high acidity. On the contrary, neutralization of the acid sites could explain the higher hydrogen selectivity and the lower ethylene yields exhibited by the Co/Y-Na and Co/Y-mod-Na. In addition, the physicochemical characterization of these catalysts by XRD, BET surface area, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and TEM allowed to connect the presence of mesoporous with the formation of metallic cobalt particles with small size, high dispersion, and with high interaction with the zeolitic support, explaining the high reforming activity exhibited by the co/y-mod-Na sample as well as its higher hydrogen selectivity. It has been also observed that the formation of coke is affected by the presence of mesoporous and acidity. Both properties seem to have an opposite effect on the reforming catalyst, decreasing and increasing the coke deposition, respectively.","da Costa-Serra, Javier Francisco; Navarro, Maria Teresa; Rey, Fernando; Chica, Antonio",Nanomaterials (Basel),155,1

Results: 171 cases met the inclusion criteria; most were Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander (80%) and the median age was 19 months. Of these cases, 65% and 25% were fully or partially vaccinated, compared to 71% and 21% of controls. Evidence that cases were less likely than controls to have received a rotavirus vaccine dose was weak, OR 0.79 (95% CI, 0.46–1.34). On pre-specified subgroup analysis, there was some evidence of protection among children <12 months (OR 0.48 [95% CI, 0.22–1.02]), and among fully vs. partially vaccinated children (OR 0.65 [95% CI, 0.42–1.01]). Conclusion: Despite the known effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination, a protective effect of either rotavirus vaccine during a G2P[4] outbreak in these settings among predominantly Aboriginal children was weak, highlighting the ongoing need for a more effective rotavirus vaccine and public health strategies to better protect Aboriginal children.","Middleton, Bianca F.; Danchin, Margie; Quinn, Helen; Ralph, Anna P.; Pingault, Nevada; Jones, Mark; Estcourt, Marie; Snelling, Tom",Pathogens,155,11

Previous research has shown that interventions delivered via smartphones are efficacious in promoting self-monitoring of alcohol use, have utility in reducing alcohol consumption, and have a broad reach. OBJECTIVE: This single-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to assess the efficacy of a 28-day brief alcohol intervention delivered via a smartphone app (Drinks:Ration) in reducing weekly self-reported alcohol consumption between baseline and 3-month follow-up among veterans who drink at a hazardous or harmful level and receive or have received support for mental health symptoms in a clinical setting. METHODS: In this two-arm, single-blinded RCT, a smartphone app that includes interactive features designed to enhance participants’ motivation and personalized messaging is compared with a smartphone app that provides only government guidance on alcohol consumption. The trial will be conducted in a veteran population that has sought help through Combat Stress, a UK veteran’s mental health charity. Recruitment, consent, and data collection will be carried out automatically through the Drinks:Ration platform. The primary outcome is the change in self-reported weekly alcohol consumption between baseline (day 0) and 3-month follow-up (day 84) as measured using the Time-Line Follow back for Alcohol Consumption. Secondary outcome measures include (1) change in the baseline to 3-month follow-up (day 84) Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test score and (2) change in the baseline to 3-month follow-up (day 84) World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF score to assess the quality of adjusted life years. Process evaluation measures include (1) app use and (2) usability ratings as measured by the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire. The primary and secondary outcomes will also be reassessed at the 6-month follow-up (day 168) to assess the longer-term benefits of the intervention, which will be reported as a secondary outcome. RESULTS: The study will begin recruitment in October 2020 and is expected to require 12 months to complete. The study results will be published in 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This study assesses whether a smartphone app is efficacious in reducing self-reported alcohol consumption in a veteran population that has sought help through Combat Stress using personalized messaging and interactive features. This innovative approach, if successful, may provide a means to deliver a low-cost health promotion program that has the potential to reach large groups, in particular those who are geographically dispersed, such as military personnel.

Determining the optimal levels of nutrient supplies to cultures can eliminate feeding of excess nutrients, lowering production costs and reducing nutrient pollution into the environment. With the advent of omics and bioinformatics methods, it is now possible to construct genome-scale models that accurately describe the metabolism of microorganisms. In this study, a genome-scale model of the green alga Chlorella vulgaris (iCZ946) was applied to predict feeding of multiple nutrients, including nitrate and glucose, under both autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions. The objective function was changed from optimizing growth to instead minimizing nitrate and glucose uptake rates, enabling predictions of feed rates for these nutrients. The metabolic model control (MMC) algorithm was validated for autotrophic growth, saving 18% nitrate while sustaining algal growth. Additionally, we obtained similar growth profiles by simultaneously controlling glucose and nitrate supplies under heterotrophic conditions for both high and low levels of glucose and nitrate. Finally, the nitrate supply was controlled in order to retain protein and chlorophyll synthesis, albeit at a lower rate, under nitrogen-limiting conditions. This model-driven cultivation strategy doubled the total volumetric yield of biomass, increased fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield by 61%, and enhanced lutein yield nearly 3 fold compared to nitrogen starvation. This study introduces a control methodology that integrates omics data and genome-scale models in order to optimize nutrient supplies based on the metabolic state of algal cells in different nutrient environments. This approach could transform bioprocessing control into a systems biology-based paradigm suitable for a wide range of species in order to limit nutrient inputs, reduce processing costs, and optimize biomanufacturing for the next generation of desirable biotechnology products.","Li, Chien-Ting; Yelsky, Jacob; Chen, Yiqun; Zuñiga, Cristal; Eng, Richard; Jiang, Liqun; Shapiro, Alison; Huang, Kai-Wen; Zengler, Karsten; Betenbaugh, Michael J.",NPJ Syst Biol Appl,155,11

Two metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) agonists (pomaglumetad [POMA] and TS-134) were assessed in two Phase Ib proof of mechanism studies of comparable designs and using identical clinical assessments and pharmacoBOLD methodology. POMA was examined in a randomized controlled trial under double-blind conditions for 10-days at doses of 80 or 320 mg/d POMA versus placebo (1:1:1 ratio). The TS-134 trial was a randomized, single-blind, 6-day study of 20 or 60 mg/d TS-134 versus placebo (5:5:2 ratio). Primary outcomes were ketamine-induced changes in pharmacoBOLD in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and symptoms reflected on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Both trials were conducted contemporaneously. 95 healthy volunteers were randomized to POMA and 63 to TS-134. High-dose POMA significantly reduced ketamine-induced BPRS total symptoms within and between-groups (p < 0.01, d = −0.41; p = 0.04, d = −0.44, respectively), but neither POMA dose significantly suppressed ketamine-induced dACC pharmacoBOLD. In contrast, low-dose TS-134 led to moderate to large within and between group reductions in both BPRS positive symptoms (p = 0.02, d = −0.36; p = 0.008, d = −0.82, respectively) and dACC pharmacoBOLD (p = 0.004, d = −0.56; p = 0.079, d = −0.50, respectively) using pooled across-study placebo data. High-dose POMA exerted significant effects on clinical symptoms, but not on target engagement, suggesting a higher dose may yet be needed, while the low dose of TS-134 showed evidence of symptom reduction and target engagement.

RECENT FINDINGS: Blockade of alternative checkpoints has improved anti-tumor immunity in mouse models and is being tested clinically with encouraging findings. In addition to modulating T cell function directly, alternative checkpoints can also regulate activity of myeloid cells and regulatory T cells to affect anti-tumor response.

Sequencing cost remains a major concern in sequencing-based study, although the application of next generation sequencing has dramatically decreased the sequencing cost and increased the efficiency. The choice of sequencing depth and the sequencing sample size will largely determine the final study investment and performance. Many studies have been conducted to find a cost-effective design of sequencing depth that can achieve certain sequencing accuracy using minimal sequencing cost. The strategies previously studied can be classified into two groups: (1) single-stage to sequence all the samples using either high (>~30×) or low (<~10×) sequencing depth; and (2) two-stage to sequence an affordable number of individuals at a high-coverage followed by a large sample of low-coverage sequencing. However, limited studies examined the performance of the medium-coverage (10–30×) sequencing depth for a genetic association study, where the optimum sequencing depth may exist. In this study, using a published simulation framework, we comprehensively compared the medium-coverage sequencing (MCS) to the single- and two-stage high/low-coverage sequencing in terms of the power and type I error of the variant discovery and association testing. We found, given certain sequencing effort, MCS yielded a comparable discovery power and better type I error control compared with the best (highest power) scenarios using other high- and low-coverage single-stage or two-stage designs. However, MCS was not as competent as other designs with respect to the association power, especially for the rare variants and when the sequencing investment was limited.","Xu, Chao; Zhang, Ruiyuan; Shen, Hui; Deng, Hong-Wen",Eur J Hum Genet,155,1

In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, eHealth is also growing in accordance with Vision 2030 and its National Transformation Program framework, creating a roadmap for increased quality and efficiency of the health care system and supporting the goal of patient-centered care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the adoption of the personal health record of the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs (MNGHA Care). METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in adults visiting outpatient clinics in hospitals at the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs hospitals in Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, Madinah, and Al Ahsa, and primary health care clinics in Riyadh and Qassim. The main outcome measure was self-reported use of MNGHA Care. RESULTS: In the sample of 546 adult patients, 383 (70.1%) reported being users of MNGHA Care. MNGHA Care users were more likely to be younger (P<.001), high school or university educated (P<.001), employed (P<.001), have a chronic condition (P=.046), use the internet to search for health-related information (P<.001), and use health apps on their mobile phones (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that there is substantial interest for the use of MNGHA Care personal health record with 70% of participants self-reporting use. To confirm these findings, objective data from the portal usage logs are needed. Maximizing the potential of MNGHA Care supports patient engagement and is aligned with the national eHealth initiative to encourage the use of technology for high-quality, accessible patient-centered care.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine, for the first time, a new internet-based intervention—REMOTION—that will be provided transdiagnostically, as an add-on to psychotherapy, to provide a blended treatment format. METHODS: A total of 70 participants will be assigned (1:1 allocation ratio) to either the intervention group (REMOTION + psychotherapy) or the treatment-as-usual group that receives psychotherapy alone. To maximize external validity, a typical outpatient treatment sample of patients diagnosed with a range of disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders, and adjustment disorder will be recruited from a university outpatient clinic. Patients with bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders, or acute suicidality will be excluded from the study. The feasibility and potential effectiveness of the intervention will be examined by assessing data at baseline, 6 weeks (post), and 12 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome is general symptom severity, assessed with the Brief Symptom Inventory.

Genome sequencing may control the former, while the latter may remain unrecognized. Using a U937 macrophage model for cell differentiation and inflammation, we investigated whether the formation of effector molecules was dependent on the FCS batch used for cultivation. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was used to identify FCS constituents and to explore their effects on cultured cells evaluating secreted cytokines, eicosanoids, and other inflammatory mediators. Remarkably, the FCS eicosanoid composition showed more batch-dependent variations than the protein composition. Efficient uptake of fatty acids from the medium by U937 macrophages and inflammation-induced release thereof was evidenced using C13-labelled arachidonic acid, highlighting rapid lipid metabolism. For functional testing, FCS batch-dependent nanomolar concentration differences of two selected eicosanoids, 5-HETE and 15-HETE, were balanced out by spiking. Culturing U937 cells at these defined conditions indeed resulted in significant proteome alterations indicating HETE-induced PPARγ activation, independently corroborated by HETE-induced formation of peroxisomes observed by high-resolution microscopy. In conclusion, the present data demonstrate that FCS-contained eicosanoids, subject to substantial batch-wise variation, may modulate cellular effector functions in cell culture experiments.","Niederstaetter, Laura; Neuditschko, Benjamin; Brunmair, Julia; Janker, Lukas; Bileck, Andrea; Del Favero, Giorgia; Gerner, Christopher",Biomolecules,155,1

Little is known about which therapeutic interventions are more cost-effective. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review was carried out to identify and critically appraise the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of CFS/ME interventions. METHODS: The review protocol was prespecified (PROSPERO: CRD42018118731). Searches were carried out across two databases—MEDLINE (1946–2020) and EMBASE (1974–2020). Additional studies were identified by searching reference lists. Only peer-reviewed journal articles of full economic evaluations examining CFS/ME interventions were included. Trial- and/or model-based economic evaluations were eligible. Data extraction and screening were carried out independently by two reviewers. The methodological quality of the economic evaluation and trial were assessed using the Consensus Health Economic Criteria checklist (CHEC-list) and Risk of Bias-2 (RoB-2) tool, respectively. A narrative synthesis was used to summarise the economic evidence for interventions for adults and children in primary and secondary care settings. RESULTS: Ten economic evaluations, all based on data derived from randomised controlled trials, met our eligibility criteria. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) was evaluated across five studies, making it the most commonly evaluated intervention. There was evidence from three trials to support CBT as a cost-effective treatment option for adults; however, findings on CBT were not uniform, suggesting that cost-effectiveness may be context-specific. A wide array of other interventions were evaluated in adults, including limited evidence from two trials supporting the cost effectiveness of graded exercise therapy (GET). Just one study assessed intervention options for children. Our review highlighted the importance of informal care costs and productivity losses in the evaluation of CFS/ME interventions. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a limited patchwork of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of interventions for CFS/ME. Evidence supports CBT as a cost-effective treatment option for adults; however, cost-effectiveness may depend on the duration and frequency of sessions. Limited evidence supports the cost effectiveness of GET. Key weaknesses in the literature included small sample sizes and short duration of follow-up. Further research is needed on pharmacological interventions and therapies for children.

Our purpose was to evaluate epicardial adipose tissue density at both unenhanced and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), along with CT densities of paracardiac and subcutaneous adipose tissue, as well as the relations of such densities with CAD. We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent cardiac CT at our institution for CAD assessment. We segmented regions of interest on epicardial, paracardiac, and subcutaneous adipose tissue on unenhanced and contrast-enhanced scans. A total of 480 patients were included, 164 of them presenting with CAD. Median epicardial adipose tissue density measured on contrast-enhanced scans (−81.5 HU; interquartile range −84.9 to −78.0) was higher than that measured on unenhanced scans (−73.4 HU; −76.9 to −69.4) (p < 0.001), whereas paracardiac and subcutaneous adipose tissue densities were not (p ≥ 0.055). Patients with or without CAD, did not show significant differences in density of epicardial, paracardiac, and subcutaneous adipose tissue either on unenhanced or contrast-enhanced scans (p ≥ 0.092). CAD patients may experience different phenomena (inflammation, fibrosis, increase in adipose depots) leading to rises or drops in epicardial adipose tissue density, resulting in variations that are difficult to detect.","Monti, Caterina Beatrice; Capra, Davide; Malavazos, Alexis; Florini, Giorgia; Parietti, Carlo; Schiaffino, Simone; Sardanelli, Francesco; Secchi, Francesco",J Clin Med,155,1

Trichinella spiralis resides primarily in mammalian skeletal muscle cells. After invading the cells of the host organism, T. spiralis must elude or invalidate the host’s innate and adaptive immune responses to survive. It is necessary to characterize the pathogenesis of trichinellosis to help to prevent the occurrence and further progression of this disease. The aims of this study were to elucidate the mechanisms of nurse cell formation, pathogenesis and immune evasion of T. spiralis, to provide valuable information for further research investigating the basic cell biology of Trichinella-infected muscle cells and the interaction between T. spiralis and its host. METHODS: We performed transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing to identify global changes at 1, 3, 7, 10 and 15 days post-infection (dpi) in gene expression in the diaphragm after the parasite entered and persisted within the murine myocytes; the mice were infected by intravenous injection of newborn larvae. Gene expression analysis was based on the alignment results. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified based on their expression levels in various samples, and functional annotation and enrichment analysis were performed. RESULTS: The most extensive and dynamic gene expression responses in host diaphragms were observed during early infection (1 dpi). The number of DEGs and genes annotated in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology databases decreased significantly in the infected mice compared to the uninfected mice at 3 and 7 dpi, suddenly increased sharply at 10 dpi, and then decreased to a lower level at 15 dpi, similar to that observed at 3 and 7 dpi. The massive initial reaction of the murine muscle cells to Trichinella infection steadied in the later stages of infection, with little additional changes detected for the remaining duration of the studied process. Although there were hundreds of DEGs at each time point, only 11 genes were consistently up- or downregulated at all 5 time points. CONCLUSIONS: The gene expression patterns identified in this study can be employed to characterize the coordinated response of T. spiralis-infected myocytes in a time-resolved manner. This comprehensive dataset presents a distinct and sensitive picture of the interaction between host and parasite during intracellular infection, which can help to elucidate how pathogens evade host defenses and coordinate the biological functions of host cells to survive in the mammalian environment.

Lactobacillus has been shown to exert beneficial effects as antimicrobial, growth promotion, and gut microbiota in humans and/or murine models, but the relevant data regarding Lactobacillus isolated from yaks was unavailable. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of Lactobacillus from yaks on the intestinal microbial community in a mouse model and determine whether Lactobacillus supplementation contributed in alleviating diarrhea by modulating gut microbiota. A total of 12 ileac samples from four groups were collected for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of V3-V4 region. Results revealed that although Lactobacillus supplementation did not change the diversity of gut microbiota in mice, the proportion of some intestinal microbiota significantly changed. Specifically, the proportion of Lactobacillus and Sphingomonas in the Lactobacillus treated-group (L-group) were increased as compared to control group (C-group), whereas Pantoea, Cutibacterium, Glutamicibacter, Turicibacter, Globicatella, Microbacterium, Facklamia, unidentified_Corynebacteriaceae, Brachybacterium, and Staphylococcus were significantly decreased in the L-group. In contrast, Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection significantly decreased the proportion of beneficial bacteria such as Globicatella, Acinetobacter, Aerococcus, and Comamonas, while loads of pathogenic bacteria significantly increased including Roseburia and Megasphaera. Interestingly, Lactobacillus administration could ameliorate the microbial community structure of E. coli-induced diarrheal mice by reducing the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria such as Paenibacillus, Aerococcus, Comamonas, Acinetobacter, Corynebacterium, Facklamia, and Globicatella. Results in this study revealed that Lactobacillus supplementation not only improved the gut microbiota but also alleviated diarrhea in mice, which may be mediated by modulating the composition and function of gut microbiota. Moreover, this study is expected to provide a new theoretical basis for the establishment of a preventive and treatment system for diarrhea in yaks.","Dong, Hailong; Liu, Bingxian; Li, Aoyun; Iqbal, Mudassar; Mehmood, Khalid; Jamil, Tariq; Chang, Yung-Fu; Zhang, Hui; Wu, Qingxia",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,155,1

Great efforts have been made to identify good vaccine candidates during the last decades, but only three molecules reached clinical trials so far. The reverse vaccinology approach has become an attractive option for vaccine design, especially regarding parasites like Schistosoma spp. that present limitations for culture maintenance. This strategy also has prompted the construction of multi-epitope based vaccines, with great immunological foreseen properties as well as being less prone to contamination, autoimmunity, and allergenic responses. Therefore, in this study we applied a robust immunoinformatics approach, targeting S. mansoni transmembrane proteins, in order to construct a chimeric antigen. Initially, the search for all hypothetical transmembrane proteins in GeneDB provided a total of 584 sequences. Using the PSORT II and CCTOP servers we reduced this to 37 plasma membrane proteins, from which extracellular domains were used for epitope prediction. Nineteen common MHC-I and MHC-II binding epitopes, from eight proteins, comprised the final multi-epitope construct, along with suitable adjuvants. The final chimeric multi-epitope vaccine was predicted as prone to induce B-cell and IFN-γ based immunity, as well as presented itself as stable and non-allergenic molecule. Finally, molecular docking and molecular dynamics foresee stable interactions between the putative antigen and the immune receptor TLR 4. Our results indicate that the multi-epitope vaccine might stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses and could be a potential vaccine candidate against schistosomiasis.","Sanches, Rodrigo C.

This has worsened over time in North America, with newer residences containing greater radon. Using data from 18,971 Canadian households, we calculated annual particle radiation dose rates due to long term residential radon exposure, and examined this as a function of occupant demographics. The current particle radiation dose rate to lungs from residential radon in Canada is 4.08 mSv/y from 108.2 Bq/m(3), with 23.4% receiving 100–2655 mSv doses that are known to elevate human cancer risk. Notably, residences built in the twenty-first century are occupied by significantly younger people experiencing greater radiation dose rates from radon (mean age of 46 at 5.01 mSv/y), relative to older groups more likely to occupy twentieth century-built properties (mean age of 53 at 3.45–4.22 mSv/y). Newer, higher radon-containing properties are also more likely to have minors, pregnant women and an overall higher number of occupants living there full time. As younger age-of-exposure to radon equates to greater lifetime lung cancer risk, these data reveal a worst case scenario of exposure bias. This is of concern as, if it continues, it forecasts serious future increases in radon-induced lung cancer in younger people.","Simms, Justin A.; Pearson, Dustin D.; Cholowsky, Natasha L.; Irvine, Jesse L.; Nielsen, Markus E.; Jacques, Weston R.; Taron, Joshua M.; Peters, Cheryl E.; Carlson, Linda E.; Goodarzi, Aaron A.",Sci Rep,155,1

The extraordinary abilities of C. auris to easily contaminate the environment around colonized patients and persist for long periods have recently resulted in major outbreaks in many countries. C. auris resists elimination by robust cleaning and other decontamination procedures, likely due to the formation of ‘dry’ biofilms. Susceptible hospitalized patients, particularly those with multiple comorbidities in intensive care settings, acquire C. auris rather easily from close contact with C. auris-infected patients, their environment, or the equipment used on colonized patients, often with fatal consequences. This review highlights the lessons learned from recent studies on the epidemiology, diagnosis, pathogenesis, susceptibility, and molecular basis of resistance to antifungal drugs and infection control measures to combat the spread of C. auris infections in healthcare facilities.

DENV is transmitted to humans via the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. Approximately 100 million people are infected annually worldwide, and most of those live in tropical and subtropical areas. There is still no effective drug or vaccine for treatment of DENV infection. In this study, we set forth to investigate the effect of melatonin, which is a natural hormone with multiple pharmacological functions, against DENV infection. Treatment with subtoxic doses of melatonin dose-dependently inhibited DENV production. Cross-protection across serotypes and various cell types was also observed. Time-of-addition assay suggested that melatonin exerts its influence during the post-entry step of viral infection. The antiviral activity of melatonin partly originates from activation of the sirtuin pathway since co-treatment with melatonin and the sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) inhibitor reversed the effect of melatonin treatment alone. Moreover, melatonin could modulate the transcription of antiviral genes that aid in suppression of DENV production. This antiviral mechanism of melatonin suggests a possible new strategy for treating DENV infection.","Morchang, Atthapan; Malakar, Shilu; Poonudom, Kanchanaphan; Noisakran, Sansanee; Yenchitsomanus, Pa-thai; Limjindaporn, Thawornchai",Viruses,155,1

It has been assumed that infection by ZIKV, as well as other viruses, is largely initiated by individual virus particles binding to and entering a cell. However, recent studies have demonstrated that multiple virus particles are frequently delivered to a cell simultaneously and that this collective particle delivery enhances infection. ZIKV is maintained in nature between Aedes aegypti mosquitos and vertebrate hosts, including humans. Human infection is initiated through the injection of a relatively small initial inoculum comprised of a genetically complex virus population. Since most mutations decrease virus fitness, collective particle transmission could benefit ZIKV and other arthropod-borne diseases by facilitating the maintenance of genetic complexity and adaptability during infection or through other mechanisms. Therefore, we utilized a barcoded ZIKV to quantify the number of virus genomes that initiate a plaque. We found that individual plaques contain a mean of 10 infecting viral genomes (range, 1 to 212). Few plaques contained more than two dominant genomes. To determine whether multigenome infectious units consist of collectively transmitting virions, infectious units of ZIKV were then separated mechanically by centrifugation, and heavier fractions were found to contain more genomes per plaque-forming unit, with larger diameters. Finally, larger/heavier infectious units reformed after removal. These data suggest that ZIKV populations consist of a variety of infectious unit sizes, likely mostly made up of aggregates, and only rarely begin with a single virus genome. IMPORTANCE The arthropod-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) infects humans and can cause severe neurological sequelae, particularly in fetuses infected in utero. How this virus has been able to spread across vast geological ranges and evolve in new host populations is not yet understood. This research demonstrates a novel mechanism of ZIKV transmission through multigenome aggregates, providing insight into ZIKV evolution, immunologic evasion, and better future therapeutic design. This study shows that ZIKV plaques result from collections of genomes rather than individual genomes, increasing the potential for interactions between ZIKV genotypes.","Sexton, Nicole R.; Bellis, Eric D.; Murrieta, Reyes A.; Spangler, Mark Cole; Cline, Parker J.; Weger-Lucarelli, James; Ebel, Gregory D.",J Virol,155,1

We constructed a new functional L. plantarum (NC8-pSIP409-alr-angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory peptide (ACEIP)) with a double-gene-labeled non-resistant screen as an expression vector. A 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay was carried out to determine the cell viability of HUVEC cells following pretreatment with NC8-pSIP409-alr-ACEIP. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to determine the apoptosis rate of HUVEC cells. Cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase (caspase)-3/8/9 activity was also assayed and western blotting was used to determine protein expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (gp91phox), angiotensin II (AngII), and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as well as corresponding indicators of oxidative stress, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). NC8-pSIP409-alr-ACEIP attenuated H(2)O(2)-induced cell death, as determined by the MTT assay. NC8-pSIP409-alr-ACEIP reduced apoptosis of HUVEC cells by FCM. In addition, compared to the positive control, the oxidative stress index of the H(2)O(2)-induced HUVEC (Hy-HUVEC), which was pretreated by NC8-pSIP409-alr-ACEIP, iNOS, gp91phox, MDA, and ROS, was decreased obviously; SOD expression level was increased; caspase-3 or -9 was decreased, but caspase-8 did not change; Bcl-2/Bax ratio was increased; permeability changes of mitochondria were inhibited; and loss of transmembrane potential was prevented. Expression of the hypertension-related protein (AngII protein) in HUVEC cells protected by NC8-pSIP409-alr-ACEIP decreased and expression of ACE2 protein increased. These plantarum results suggested that NC8-pSIP409-alr-ACEIP protects against H(2)O(2)-induced injury in HUVEC cells.

Four databases (PubMed, Scopus, OVID, Cochrane library) were queried from inception of databases through March 20th, 2020. RESULTS: Sixteen studies with 124 cases of HVPTC were included. The mean age for all patients was 52.3 years. HVPTC had a prevalence of 1.08% out of all PTC cases, with a mean tumor size of 3.1 cm. In 62% and 50% of cases, lymphovascular invasion and extrathyroidal extension were present, respectively. Follow-up data, with a mean of 49.9 months, revealed a 66% rate of lymph node metastasis and 23% rate of distant metastasis. Tumors with ≥30% hobnail morphology had a 2.6-fold increased odds of developing lymph node metastasis compared with <30% hobnail morphology, however did not differ in rates of distant metastasis. Patients ≥55 years old had a 4.5-fold increased odds of distant metastasis and a 4.7-fold increased odds of lymphovascular invasion over patients <55. CONCLUSIONS: High rates of locoregional and distant disease as well as high-risk pathological factors reveal the aggressive nature of HVPTC. Diagnostic criteria regarding percentage of hobnail morphology requires further refinement. Further studies are warranted in order to better understand how recognition of this high-risk variant impacts clinical treatment.","Donaldson, Lane B.; Yan, Flora; Morgan, Patrick F.; Kaczmar, John M.; Fernandes, Jyotika K.; Nguyen, Shaun A.; Jester, Rachel L.; Day, Terry A.",Endocrine,155,19

However, mechanisms regulating inflammation to protect the eye remain elusive. Here, we used integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics to show that the immunomodulatory metabolite itaconate and immune-responsive gene 1 (Irg1) are induced in bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus)-infected mouse eyes, bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), and Müller glia. Itaconate levels are also elevated in the vitreous of patients with bacterial endophthalmitis. Irg1 deficiency in mice led to increased ocular pathology. Conversely, intraocular administration of itaconate protects both Irg1(−/−) and wild-type mice from bacterial endophthalmitis by reducing inflammation, bacterial burden, and preserving retinal architecture and visual function. Notably, itaconate exerts synergistic effects with antibiotics. The protective, anti-inflammatory effects of itaconate are mediated via activation of NRF2/HO-1 signaling and inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome. Collectively, our study demonstrates the Irg1/itaconate axis is a regulator of intraocular inflammation and provides evidence for using itaconate, along with antibiotics, to treat bacterial infections.","Singh, Sukhvinder; Singh, Pawan Kumar; Jha, Alokkumar; Naik, Poonam; Joseph, Joveeta; Giri, Shailendra; Kumar, Ashok",Cell Rep Med,155,1

Both have strong empirical support, but few studies have compared their effectiveness head-to-head, and none has investigated what to do if the treatment tried first isn’t working well—whether to optimize the treatment already begun or to add the other treatment. METHODS: This is a single-blind Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) of 24 weeks duration with two levels of randomization, one in each of two 12-week stages. In Stage 1, children will be randomized to fluoxetine or Coping Cat Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). In Stage 2, remitters will continue maintenance-level therapy with the single-modality treatment received in Stage 1. Non-remitters during the first 12 weeks of treatment will be randomized to either [1] optimization of their Stage 1 treatment, or [2] optimization of Stage 1 treatment and addition of the other intervention. After the 24-week trial, we will follow participants during open, naturalistic treatment to assess the durability of study treatment effects. Patients, 8–17 years of age who are diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, will be recruited and treated within 9 large clinical sites throughout greater Los Angeles. They will be predominantly underserved, ethnic minorities. The primary outcome measure will be the self-report score on the 41-item youth SCARED (Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders). An intent-to-treat analysis will compare youth randomized to fluoxetine first versus those randomized to CBT first (“Main Effect 1”). Then, among Stage 1 non-remitters, we will compare non-remitters randomized to optimization of their Stage 1 monotherapy versus non-remitters randomized to combination treatment (“Main Effect 2”). The interaction of these main effects will assess whether one of the 4 treatment sequences (CBT➔CBT; CBT➔med; med➔med; med➔CBT) in non-remitters is significantly better or worse than predicted from main effects alone.

Economic sustainability has largely driven the reform process leading to the Health and Social Care Act (HSCA) 2012, however; other considerations have also played a role in the journey to turn the health and social care service into an institution which is fit for the 21st-century needs. This article examines the impact of the HSCA 2012 on those made vulnerable through mental ill health. It then considers three issues: First, whether parity between mental and physical health can have life beyond political rhetoric; second, what impact driving up efficiency within the NHS will have upon mental health patients; and finally, the extent to which the personalisation agenda can be meaningfully applied within the mental health context.","Glover-Thomas, Nicola",Med Law Int,155,1

It has also drawn the attention of researchers due to its evolving immune evasion strategies and increased drug resistance. The emergence of multi-drug-resistant-strains has urged the need to explore novel therapeutic options as an alternative to antibiotics. Due to the upsurge in antibiotic resistance mechanisms exhibited by A. baumannii, the current therapeutic strategies are rendered less effective. The aim of this study is to explore novel therapeutic alternatives against A. baumannii to control the ailed infection. In this study, a computational framework is employed involving, pan genomics, subtractive proteomics and reverse vaccinology strategies to identify core promiscuous vaccine candidates. Two chimeric vaccine constructs having B-cell derived T-cell epitopes from prioritized vaccine candidates; APN, AdeK and AdeI have been designed and checked for their possible interactions with host BCR, TLRs and HLA Class I and II Superfamily alleles. These vaccine candidates can be experimentally validated and thus contribute to vaccine development against A. baumannii infections.","Shahid, Fatima; Zaheer, Tahreem; Ashraf, Shifa Tariq; Shehroz, Muhammad; Anwer, Farha; Naz, Anam; Ali, Amjad",Sci Rep,155,8

We aimed to evaluate the genetic profile of TLR pathway-related key genes; the myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MYD88), IL1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), the nuclear factor kappa-B1 (NFKB1), and interleukin 6 (IL6) in the blood of neonates with sepsis at the time of admission and post-treatment for the available paired-samples. This case–control study included 124 infants with sepsis admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and 17 controls. The relative gene expressions were quantified by TaqMan Real-Time qPCR and correlated to the clinic-laboratory data. MYD88, NFKB1, and IL6 relative expressions were significantly higher in sepsis cases than controls. Higher levels of MYD88 and IL6 were found in male neonates and contributed to the sex-based separation of the cases by the principal component analysis. ROC analysis revealed MYD88 and NFKB1 transcripts to be good biomarkers for sepsis. Furthermore, patients with high circulatory MYD88 levels were associated with poor survival, as revealed by Kaplan–Meier curves analysis. MYD88, NFKB1, and IL6 transcripts showed association with different poor-outcome manifestations. Clustering analysis split the patient cohort into three distinct groups according to their transcriptomic signature and CRP levels. In conclusion, the study TLR pathway-related transcripts have a gender-specific signature, diagnostic, and prognostic clinical utility in neonatal sepsis.","AbdAllah, Nouran B.; Toraih, Eman A.; Al Ageeli, Essam; Elhagrasy, Hala; Gouda, Nawal S.; Fawzy, Manal S.; Helal, Ghada M.",Sci Rep,155,1

In this study, N-2-hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride chitosan (N-2-HACC) and N,O-carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) were synthesized as adjuvant and delivery carrier for vaccine antigens. N-2-HACC-CMC/NDV/IBV nanoparticles (NPs) (NDV/La Sota and IBV/H120 encapsulated in N-2-HACC-CMC NPs) and N-2-HACC-CMC/NDV-IBV NPs (the mixing of N-2-HACC-CMC/NDV NPs and N-2-HACC-CMC/IBV NPs in a ratio of 1:1) were prepared by the polyelectrolyte composite method, respectively. Both nanoparticles exhibited lower cytotoxicity and higher stability. Their bioactivities were maintained when they were stored at 37 °C for three weeks. Release assay in vitro showed that both NDV and IBV could be sustainably released from the nanoparticles after an initial burst release. In vivo immunization of chickens showed that N-2-HACC-CMC/NDV/IBV NPs or N-2-HACC-CMC/NDV-IBV NPs intranasally induced higher titers of IgG and IgA antibodies, significantly promoted proliferation of lymphocytes and induced higher levels of interleukine-2 (IL-2), IL-4 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) than the commercially combined attenuated live vaccine did. This is the first study in the field of animal vaccines demonstrating that intranasal administration of chickens with antigens (NDV and IBV) encapsulated with chitosan derivative could induce humoral, cellular, and mucosal immune responses, which protected chickens from the infection of highly virulent NDV and IBV. This study indicated that N-2-HACC-CMC could be used as an efficient adjuvant and delivery carrier for further development of mucosal vaccines and drugs and could have an immense application potential in medicine.","Zhao, Kai; Li, Shanshan; Li, Wei; Yu, Lu; Duan, Xutong; Han, Jinyu; Wang, Xiaohua; Jin, Zheng",,155,1

We aimed to investigate the association between common infections and dementia in adults (≥65 years) in a UK population-based cohort study. METHODS: We did a historical cohort study of individuals who were 65 years and older with no history of dementia or cognitive impairment using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to Hospital Episode Statistics between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2018. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the association between time-updated previous common infections (sepsis, pneumonia, other lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections) and incident dementia diagnosis. We also tested for effect modification by diabetes since it is an independent risk factor for dementia and co-occurs with infection. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2018, our study included 989 800 individuals (median age 68·6 years [IQR 65·0–77·0]; 537 602 [54·3%] women) of whom 402 204 (40·6%) were diagnosed with at least one infection and 56 802 (5·7%) had incident dementia during a median follow-up of 5·2 years (IQR 2·3–9·0). Dementia risk increased in those with any infection (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1·53 [95% CI 1·50–1·55]) compared with those without infection. HRs were highest for sepsis (HR 2·08 [1·89–2·29]) and pneumonia (HR 1·88 [1·77–1·99]) and for infections leading to hospital admission (1·99 [1·94–2·04]). HRs were also higher in individuals with diabetes compared with those without diabetes. INTERPRETATION: Common infections, particularly those resulting in hospitalisation, were associated with an increased risk of dementia persisting over the long term. Whether reducing infections lowers the risk of subsequent dementia warrants evaluation.

The aim of this study was to analyze the profile of exhaled breath volatile metabolites (BVM) and gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy volunteers after a single ingestion of maltodextrin (placebo) versus chitin-glucan (CG), an insoluble DF previously shown to be fermented into short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) by the human microbiota in vitro. Maltodextrin (4.5 g at day 0) or CG (4.5 g at day 2) were added to a standardized breakfast in fasting healthy volunteers (n = 15). BVM were measured using selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) throughout the day. A single ingestion of 4.5 g CG did not induce significant gastrointestinal discomfort. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of breath highlighted that 13 MS-fragments (among 408 obtained from ionizations of breath) discriminated CG versus maltodextrin acute intake in the posprandial state. The targeted analysis revealed that CG increased exhaled butyrate and 5 other BVM – including the microbial metabolites 2,3-butanedione and 3-hydroxybutanone – with a peak observed 6 h after CG intake. Correlation analyses with fecal microbiota (Illumina 16S rRNA sequencing) spotlighted Mitsuokella as a potential genus responsible for the presence of butyric acid, triethylamine and 3-hydroxybutanone in the breath. In conclusion, measuring BMV in the breath reveals the microbial signature of the fermentation of DF after a single ingestion. This protocol allows to analyze the time-course of released bioactive metabolites that could be proposed as new biomarkers of DF fermentation, potentially linked to their biological properties.

Recent studies showed that AMPs perpetuate great potential that is not limited to antimicrobial activity. They are also crucial regulators of host immune responses that can modulate a wide range of activities, such as immune regulation, wound healing, and apoptosis. However, a microorganism's ability to adapt and to resist existing antibiotics triggered the scientific community to develop alternatives to conventional antibiotics. Therefore, to address this issue, we proposed Co-AMPpred, an in silico-aided AMP prediction method based on compositional features of amino acid residues to classify AMPs and non-AMPs. RESULTS: In our study, we developed a prediction method that incorporates composition-based sequence and physicochemical features into various machine-learning algorithms. Then, the boruta feature-selection algorithm was used to identify discriminative biological features. Furthermore, we only used discriminative biological features to develop our model. Additionally, we performed a stratified tenfold cross-validation technique to validate the predictive performance of our AMP prediction model and evaluated on the independent holdout test dataset. A benchmark dataset was collected from previous studies to evaluate the predictive performance of our model. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental results show that combining composition-based and physicochemical features outperformed existing methods on both the benchmark training dataset and a reduced training dataset. Finally, our proposed method achieved 80.8% accuracies and 0.871 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve by evaluating on independent test set.

Some of these relevant biological mechanisms include antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, protein and hormone synthesis, energy generation, and regulation of gene transcription. Moreover, relative vitamin deficiencies in plasma are common during sepsis and vitamin therapy has been associated with improved outcomes in some adult and pediatric studies. High-dose intravenous vitamin C has been the vitamin therapy most extensively studied in adult patients with sepsis and septic shock. This includes three randomized control trials (RCTs) as monotherapy with a total of 219 patients showing significant reduction in organ dysfunction and lower mortality when compared to placebo, and five RCTs as a combination therapy with thiamine and hydrocortisone with a total of 1134 patients showing no difference in clinical outcomes. Likewise, the evidence for the role of other vitamins in sepsis remains mixed. In this narrative review, we present the preclinical, clinical, and safety evidence of the most studied vitamins in sepsis, including vitamin C, thiamine (i.e., vitamin B(1)), and vitamin D. We also present the relevant evidence of the other vitamins that have been studied in sepsis and critical illness in both children and adults, including vitamins A, B(2), B(6), B(12), and E. IMPACT: Vitamins are key effectors in many biological processes relevant to sepsis. We present the preclinical, clinical, and safety evidence of the most studied vitamins in pediatric sepsis. Designing response-adaptive platform trials may help fill in knowledge gaps regarding vitamin use for critical illness and association with clinical outcomes.","Wald, Eric L.; Badke, Colleen M.; Hintz, Lauren K.; Spewak, Michael; Sanchez-Pinto, L.

China promotes telemedicine with great efforts, and its practices in the deployment of telemedicine platforms and delivery of services have become important references for the research and development in this field. OBJECTIVE: Our work described in this paper focuses on a regional telemedicine platform that was built in 2014. We analyzed the system design scheme and remote consultations that were conducted via the system to understand the deployment and service delivery processes of a representative telemedicine platform in China. METHODS: We collected information on remote consultations conducted from 2015 to 2020 via the regional telemedicine platform that employs a centralized architectural system model. We used graphs and statistical methods to describe the changing trends of service volume of remote consultation, geographical and demographic distribution of patients, and waiting time and duration of consultations. The factors that affect consultation duration and patient referral were analyzed by multivariable linear regression models and binary logistic regression models, respectively. The attitudes toward telemedicine of 225 medical practitioners and 225 patients were collected using the snowball sampling method. RESULTS: The regional telemedicine platform covers all levels of medical institutions and hospitals in all 18 cities of Henan Province as well as some interprovince hospitals. From 2015 to 2020, 103,957 remote medical consultations were conducted via the platform with an annual increasing rate of 0.64%. A total of 86.64% (90,069/103,957) of medical institutions (as clients) that applied for remote consultations were tier 1 or 2 and from less-developed regions; 65.65% (68,243/103,945) of patients who applied for remote consultations were aged over 50 years. The numbers of consultations were high for departments focusing in the treatment of chronic diseases such as neurology, respiratory medicine, and oncology. The invited experts were mainly experienced doctors with senior professional titles. Year of consultation, tier of hospital, consultation department, and necessity of patient referral were the main factors affecting the duration of consultations. In surveys, we found that 60.4% (136/225) of medical practitioners and 53.8% (121/225) of patients had high satisfaction and believed that telemedicine is of vital importance for the treatment of illness. CONCLUSIONS: The development of telemedicine in China shows a growing trend and provides great benefits especially to medical institutions located in less developed regions and senior citizens who have less mobility. Cases of remote consultations are mainly for chronic diseases. At present, the importance and necessity of telemedicine are well recognized by both patients and medical practitioners. However, the waiting time needs to be further reduced to improve the efficiency of remote medical services.","Cui, Fangfang; He, Xianying; Zhai, Yunkai; Lyu, Minzhao; Shi, Jinming; Sun, Dongxu; Jiang, Shuai; Li, Chenchen; Zhao, Jie",J Med Internet Res,155,1

In the present study, the impact of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was explored to determine methods for the diagnosis and treatment of RA. METHODS: First, fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) were obtained from a collagen-induced rat RA model. Next, MCP-1-overexpression plasmid and small interfering RNA were transfected into human and rat FLSs. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), Transwell migration and flow cytometry assays were used to analyze cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis of FLSs following MCP-1 transfections, respectively. Furthermore, western blotting was used to analyze the expression levels of p-P38, p-PI3K, PI3K, CD31, VEGF, TNF-α and IL-β in FLSs following MCP-1 transfection. In addition, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and ELISAs were used to analyze the expression levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), estrogen receptor, MCP-1 and pentraxin-3 in patients with clinical RA, followed by correlation analysis of clinical data. Finally, expression validation, diagnostic and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of MCP-1 were performed. RESULTS: MCP-1 promoted FLS proliferation and migration, and affected the apoptosis of FLSs. In addition, the expression levels of p-P38, p-PI3K, PI3K, CD31, VEGF, TNF-α and IL-β were also affected by MCP-1. In patients with clinical RA, the expression level of MCP-1 was increased. Moreover, CRP expression level was significantly up-regulated in RA. Clinically, MCP-1 was strongly correlated with tender joint count, swollen joint count, visual analog scale for general health and disease activity score 28 (DAS28)-MCP-1, and was moderately correlated with DAS28 and DAS28-CRP. PPI analysis showed that MCP-1 mainly interacted with other inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, MCP-1 may play a significant regulatory role in RA, and could be used as a measurement index of clinical RA activity.","Tong, Xiang; Yu, Dongdong; Yu, Li; Chen, Weiqian; Wen, Yanling; Gu, Pengcheng",PeerJ,155,17

Meyer). G-Re has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic effects. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of G-Re on neuroinflammatory responses in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglia and its protective effects on hippocampal neurons. Cytokine levels were measured using ELISA and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were assessed using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Protein levels of inflammatory molecules and kinase activity were assessed by western blotting. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay; apoptosis was estimated by Annexin V apoptosis assay. The results revealed that G-Re significantly inhibited the production of IL-6, TNF-α, nitric oxide (NO) and ROS in BV2 microglial cells, and that of NO in mouse primary microglia, without affecting cell viability. G-Re also inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α. In addition, G-Re dose-dependently suppressed LPS-mediated phosphorylation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAMK)2, CAMK4, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK). Moreover, the conditioned medium from LPS-stimulated microglial cells induced HT22 hippocampal neuronal cell death, whereas that from microglial cells incubated with both LPS and G-Re ameliorated HT22 cell death in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggested that G-Re suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by blocking CAMK/ERK/JNK/NF-κB signaling in microglial cells and protected hippocampal cells by reducing these inflammatory and neurotoxic factors released from microglial cells. The present findings indicated that G-Re may be a potential treatment option for neuroinflammatory disorders and could have therapeutic potential for various neurodegenerative diseases.","Madhi, Iskander; Kim, Ji-Hee; Shin, Ji Eun; Kim, Younghee",Mol Med Rep,155,1

The power subsector plays a pivotal role in the sense that it emerges as the key cross-sectional element for the society’s functioning (production, services, healthcare, education and others). A modern society consists of infrastructure systems that are primarily dependent on continuous electricity supplies. Each and every element of the electric power infrastructure is unique, and thus, its malfunction can disrupt the functioning of an important part of the electric power infrastructure. In conjunction with ensuring the functioning of electric power infrastructure, our attention must be drawn to the resilience issue. As far as the resilience of electric power infrastructure is concerned, it can resist weather-related events ensuring there are no disruptions in continuous electricity supplies. First, in the introductory part, the article presents the legal framework in the Slovak Republic. Second, it describes the current state of the electric power infrastructure of Slovakia. Third, it handles the state of the level of security risk assessment. Later on, in the literature review, besides turning to the issue of resilience assessment, the authors focused on the area of resilience of power engineering. Furthermore, the article scrutinizes resilience assessment in Slovakia, and it briefly examines approaches towards natural threats. In addition, the article demonstrates several approaches towards flood resilience. Having used different methods, the primary concern is to devise a framework for resilience assessment. Therefore, the included case study examines aspects of the proposed framework for resilience assessment.

Colloid Interface Sci. 581 (2021) 884–894],13.385841,6.8326926,2021-11-15,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of pulmonary embolism (PE) in the acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD) is highly controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the epidemiology and characteristics of PE with AE-COPD for current studies. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases for studies published prior to October 21, 2020. Pooled proportions with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using a random effects model. Odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals were used as effect measures for dichotomous and continuous variables, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies involving 3170 patients were included. The prevalence of PE and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in AE-COPD patients was 17.2% (95% CI: 13.4%-21.3%) and 7.1% (95% CI: 3.7%-11.4%%), respectively. Dyspnea (OR = 6.77, 95% CI: 1.97–23.22), pleuritic chest pain (OR = 3.25, 95% CI: 2.06–5.12), lower limb asymmetry or edema (OR = 2.46, 95% CI:1.51–4.00), higher heart rates (MD = 20.51, 95% CI: 4.95–36.08), longer hospital stays (MD = 3.66, 95% CI: 3.01–4.31) were associated with the PE in the AE-COPD patients. Levels of D-dimer (MD = 1.51, 95% CI: 0.80–2.23), WBC counts (MD = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.14–2.70) were significantly higher and levels of PaO(2) was lower (MD = -17.20, 95% CI: -33.94- -0.45, P<0.05) in the AE-COPD with PE group. The AE-COPD with PE group had increased risk of fatal outcome than the AE-COPD group (OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.43–3.50). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PE during AE-COPD varies considerably among the studies. AE-COPD patients with PE experienced an increased risk of death, especially among the ICU patients. Understanding the potential risk factors for PE may help clinicians identify AE-COPD patients at increased risk of PE.

METHODS: Using population-based data from up to 144,890 UK Biobank cohort participants, we tested associations of circulating CRP concentrations with depression and anxiety symptom scores and probable diagnosis, including tests for linearity, disorder-specificity and sex difference. We examined potential causality using 1-sample and 2-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses testing associations of genetically-predicted CRP concentration and IL-6 activity with depression and anxiety. The study was conducted from June 2019 to February 2021. FINDINGS: CRP concentration was associated with depressive and anxiety symptom scores and with probable diagnoses of depression and generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) in a dose-response fashion. These associations were stronger for depression than for anxiety, and for women than for men although less consistently. MR analyses provided consistent results suggesting that genetically predicted higher IL-6 activity was associated with increased risk for depressive symptoms, while genetically-predicted higher CRP concentration was associated with decreased risks of depressive and anxiety symptoms. INTERPRETATION: Altered activity of the IL-6/IL-6R pathway could be a risk factor for depression. The field now requires experimental studies of IL-6 modulation in humans and animal models to further examine causality, mechanisms and treatment potential. Such studies are also needed to elucidate mechanisms for divergent associations of genetically-predicted higher IL-6 activity (risk increasing) and higher CRP concentrations (protective) with depression/anxiety.

This partly may lead to failure to achieve the global goal of 90-90-90 targets in most developing countries including Ethiopia. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the virological failure and its predictors among children receiving antiretroviral therapy at the University of Gondar comprehensive specialized hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted among 253 study cohorts from January 2020-April 2021. Socio-demographic characteristics were collected using a structured questionnaire via a face-to-face interview, while detailed clinical data of the children were collected by reviewing the medical record. About 5 ml of blood were collected for the analysis of complete blood count and viral load quantification. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 and variables at p-value < 0.05 in the multivariable analysis were considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: In this study, the viral load suppression rate among antiretroviral therapy experienced children was 68.8%. Meanwhile, the overall virological failure among study participants was 19.4%. Children living without family (AOR = 3.63; 95%CI: 1.27–10.24), children with unemployed family (AOR = 4.95; 95%CI: 1.74–14.12), being wasted (AOR = 3.02; 95%CI: 1.19–7.67) being stunted (AOR = 2.38;95%CI:1.03–5.46), anemia (AOR = 5.50:95%CI;1.37–22.04) and being lymphopenic (AOR = 2.69:95%CI;1.04–7.75) were significantly associated with virological failure among children under treatment. CONCLUSION: Higher virological failure among children was noteworthy in the present study. Caretakers other than immediate family, unemployed family, wasted, stunted, anemia, and lymphopenia were significant independent predictors of virological failure. Hence, standard, and optimal management of children under treatment should be warranted.","Bayleyegn, Biruk; Kifle, Zemene Demelash; Geremew, Demeke",PLoS One,155,1

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore mechanisms that support or inhibit the exchange of interorganizational digital transformation knowledge. METHODS: We conducted a formative qualitative evaluation of the GDE program. We used semistructured interviews with clinical, technical, and managerial staff; national program managers and network leaders; nonparticipant observations of knowledge transfer activities through attending meetings, workshops, and conferences; and documentary analysis of policy documents. The data were thematically analyzed by drawing on a theory-informed sociotechnical coding framework. We used a mixture of deductive and inductive methods, supported by NVivo software, to facilitate coding. RESULTS: We conducted 341 one-on-one and 116 group interviews, observed 86 meetings, and analyzed 245 documents from 36 participating provider organizations. We also conducted 51 high-level interviews with policy makers and vendors; performed 77 observations of national meetings, workshops, and conferences; and analyzed 80 national documents. Formal processes put in place by the GDE program to initiate and reinforce knowledge transfer and learning have accelerated the growth of informal knowledge networking and helped establish the foundations of a learning ecosystem. However, formal networks were most effective when supported by informal networking. The benefits of networking were enhanced (and costs reduced) by geographical proximity, shared culture and context, common technological functionality, regional and strategic alignments, and professional agendas. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge exchange is most effective when sustained through informal networking driven by the mutual benefits of sharing knowledge and convergence between group members in their organizational and technological setting and goals. Policy interventions need to enhance incentives and reduce barriers to sharing across the ecosystem, be flexible in tailoring formal interventions to emerging needs, and promote informal knowledge sharing.","Cresswell, Kathrin; Sheikh, Aziz; Franklin, Bryony Dean; Krasuska, Marta; The Nguyen, Hung; Hinder, Susan; Lane, Wendy; Mozaffar, Hajar; Mason, Kathy; Eason, Sally; Potts, Henry; Williams, Robin",J Med Internet Res,155,19

Genomic viral integrations, termed ‘endogenous viral elements’ (EVEs), could protect the host from infection. It is widely known past viral infections and EVEs play an active role in antiviral defence in invertebrates and plants. This study aimed to characterise actively transcribed EVEs in Australian marsupial species, because they may play an integral role in cellular defence against viruses. This study screened publicly available RNA sequencing data sets (n = 35) and characterised 200 viral transcripts from thirteen Australian marsupial species. Of the 200 transcripts, 188 originated from either Bornaviridae, Filoviridae, or Parvoviridae EVEs. The other twelve transcripts were from putative active infections from members of the Herpesviridae and Anelloviridae, and Hepadnaviridae. EVE transcripts (n = 188) were mapped to marsupial genomes (where available, n = 5/13) to identify the genomic insertion sites. Of the 188 transcripts, 117 mapped to 39 EVEs within the koala, bare-nosed wombat, tammar wallaby, brushtail possum, and Tasmanian devil genomes. The remaining eight animals had no available genome (transcripts n = 71). Every marsupial has Bornaviridae, Filoviridae, and Parvoviridae EVEs, a trend widely observed in eutherian mammals. Whilst eutherian bornavirus EVEs are predominantly nucleoprotein-derived, marsupial bornavirus EVEs demonstrate a surprising replicase gene bias. We predicted these widely distributed EVEs were conserved within marsupials from ancient germline integrations, as many were over 65 million years old. One bornavirus replicase EVE, present in six marsupial genomes, was estimated to be 160 million years old, predating the American–Australian marsupial split. We considered transcription of these EVEs through small non-coding RNA as an ancient viral defence. Consistent with this, in koala small RNA sequence data sets, we detected Bornaviridae replicase and Filoviridae nucleoprotein produced small RNA. These were enriched in testis tissue, suggesting they could protect marsupials from vertically transmitted viral integrations.","Harding, Emma F; Russo, Alice G; Yan, Grace J H; Waters, Paul D; White, Peter A",Virus Evol,155,19

Still, tools to increase our knowledge about lumpfish biology are lacking. Here, we successfully established and characterized the first Lumpfish Gill cell line (LG-1). LG-1 are adherent, homogenous and have a flat, stretched-out and almost transparent appearance. Transmission electron microscopy revealed cellular protrusions and desmosome-like structures that, together with their ability to generate a transcellular epithelial/endothelial resistance, suggest an epithelial or endothelial cell type. Furthermore, the cells exert Cytochrome P450 1A activity. LG-1 supported the propagation of several viruses that may lead to severe infectious diseases with high mortalities in fish farming, including viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV). Altogether, our data indicate that the LG-1 cell line originates from an epithelial or endothelial cell type and will be a valuable in vitro research tool to study gill cell function as well as host-pathogen interactions in lumpfish.","Sindre, Hilde; Gjessing, Mona C.; Fosse, Johanna Hol; Hermansen, Lene C.; Böckerman, Inger; Amundsen, Marit M.; Dahle, Maria K.; Solhaug, Anita",Cells,155,1

A systematic scoping review methodology was implemented. Identification of the research themes and knowledge gap was performed. After applying the exclusion criteria, a total of 66 research publications were identified and retrieved from Scopus, Web of Science, Pubmed, and Google Scholar. Several key themes where propolis is potentially useful were subsequently identified, namely detoxification, neuroinflammation, ischemia/ischemia-reperfusion injury/traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and epilepsy models, depression, cytotoxicity, cognitive improvement, regenerative medicine, brain infection, and adverse effects. In conclusion, propolis is shown to have protective and therapeutic benefits in alleviating symptoms of brain and neurological disorders and injuries, demonstrated by various in vitro studies, animal models, and human clinical trials.

A lack of reliable and reproducible reverse genetics systems for HuRVAs has limited a proper understanding of HuRVA biology and also the rational design of live-attenuated vaccines. Since the development of the first reverse genetics system for RVAs (partially plasmid-based reverse genetics system) in 2006, there have been many efforts with the goal of generating infectious recombinant HuRVAs entirely from cloned cDNAs. However, the establishment of a HuRVA reverse genetics system was very challenging until 2019. This review article provides an overview of the historical background of the recent development of long-awaited HuRVA reverse genetics systems, beginning with the generation of recombinant human-simian reassortant RVAs with the aid of a helper virus in 2006 and the generation of recombinant animal (simian) RVAs in a helper virus-free manner in 2017, and culminating in the generation of recombinant HuRVAs entirely from plasmid cDNAs in 2019. Notably, the original HuRVA reverse genetics system has already been optimized to increase the efficiency of virus generation. Although the application of HuRVA reverse genetics systems has only just been initiated, these technologies will help to answer HuRVA research questions regarding viral replication and pathogenicity that could not be addressed before, and to develop next-generation vaccines and intestine-specific rotaviral vectors.","Komoto, Satoshi; Fukuda, Saori; Murata, Takayuki; Taniguchi, Koki",Viruses,155,1

However, the majority of human evolutionary history occurred in environments with higher pathogenic diversity and low cardiovascular risk. We hypothesize that in high-pathogen and energy-limited contexts, the APOE4 allele confers benefits by reducing innate inflammation when uninfected, while maintaining higher lipid levels that buffer costs of immune activation during infection. Among Tsimane forager-farmers of Bolivia (N = 1266, 50% female), APOE4 is associated with 30% lower C-reactive protein, and higher total cholesterol and oxidized LDL. Blood lipids were either not associated, or negatively associated with inflammatory biomarkers, except for associations of oxidized LDL and inflammation which were limited to obese adults. Further, APOE4 carriers maintain higher levels of total and LDL cholesterol at low body mass indices (BMIs). These results suggest that the relationship between APOE4 and lipids may be beneficial for pathogen-driven immune responses and unlikely to increase cardiovascular risk in an active subsistence population.","Garcia, Angela R; Finch, Caleb; Gatz, Margaret; Kraft, Thomas; Eid Rodriguez, Daniel; Cummings, Daniel; Charifson, Mia; Buetow, Kenneth; Beheim, Bret A; Allayee, Hooman; Thomas, Gregory S; Stieglitz, Jonathan; Gurven, Michael D; Kaplan, Hillard; Trumble, Benjamin C",,155,1

Tobacco smoke and emissions from combustion of fossil fuel and biomass fuel are the major airborne pollutants affecting human lung health. Oxidative stress is the dominant driving force by which the airborne pollutants exert their toxicity in lungs and cause respiratory diseases. Most airborne pollutants are associated with intrinsic oxidative potential and, additionally, stimulate endogenous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Elevated ROS and RNS in lungs modulate redox signals and cause irreversible damage to critical biomolecules (lipids, proteins and DNA) and initiate various pathogenic cellular process. This chapter provides an insight into oxidative stress-linked pathogenic cellular process such as lipid peroxidation, inflammation, cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, epigenetic changes, profibrotic signals and mucus hypersecretion, which drive the development and progression of lung diseases. Lungs are associated with robust enzymatic and non-enzymatic (GSH, ascorbic acid, uric acid, vitamin E) antioxidant defences. However, sustained production of free radicals due to continuous exposures to airborne pollutants overwhelms lung antioxidant defences and causes oxidative injury. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the critical roles and therapeutic potential of upregulating lung antioxidants for intervention of respiratory diseases; however, so far clinical benefits in antioxidant supplementation trials have been minimal and conflicting. Antioxidants alone may not be effective in treatment of respiratory diseases; however it could be a promising adjunctive therapy.","Thimmulappa, Rajesh K.; Chattopadhyay, Indranil; Rajasekaran, Subbiah",Oxidative Stress in Lung Diseases,155,1

Viruses are classified as DNA viruses and RNA viruses. Imaging of viral encephalitis is often nonspecific showing focal or diffuse edema (acute infection) or focal atrophy (chronic infection). Location of the lesion depends on causative agent, thus, HSV encephalitis displays an almost pathognomonic involvement of the limbic system. The various steps in the pathogenesis include entry into the body, delivery of the virus to the target tissue, interaction of virus with target tissue, cytopathogenesis, host responses, immunopathology, virus production in a tissue with release of the virus to other people (contagion), and transmission of viruses. Treatment consists of administration of antiviral drugs which aim at altering virion disruption, attachment, penetration and uncoating, RNA synthesis, genome replication, virion assembly and release. Clinical outcome depends on age of infection, nature of disease, severity of disease, and progression of viral disease. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection is a serious health problem worldwide as 33 million adults and 2 million children are infected with HIV-1. The brain is often involved which leads to the HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) of which asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), mild neurocognitive disorder (MND), and HIV-associated dementia (HAD) represent various stages. The neuropathologic changes in HIV-1 induced lesions, i.e. HIV-1 encephalitis (characterized by multiple disseminated foci composed of microglia, macrophages, and multinucleated giant cells (MGCs) predominantly located in the cortex, deep gray matter, and the white matter), HIV-1 leukoencephalopathy (diffuse damage to the white matter), lymphocytic meningitis (LM), perivascular lymphocytic infiltration (PLI), vacuolar myelopathy (VM), vacuolar leukoencephalopathy (VL) are described. Therapy might lead to the immune restituiton inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The sequelae of HIV-1 infection of the nervous system include changes in neuronal number, neuronal size, synapses, dendrites, nerve fibers, astroglia, oligodendroglia, microglia/macrophages, vessels, vascular endothelial cells, and capillaries. Pathogenetic mechanisms deal with the mode of entrance of HIV-1 into the brain, target cells of HIV-1, mechanisms of brain lesions, and interactions between the blood–brain-barrier (BBB) and HIV. Cytomegalovirus infection (CMV), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) encephalitis, and Tick-borne encephalitis are further described.","Weis, Serge; Sonnberger, Michael; Dunzinger, Andreas; Voglmayr, Eva; Aichholzer, Martin; Kleiser, Raimund; Strasser, Peter",Imaging Brain Diseases,155,17

The disease is prevalent in all countries with almost 100% incidence rate. Chicken and commercially reared pheasant are the natural host for IBV. Virus causes respiratory diseases, poor weight gain, feed efficiency in broiler, damage to oviduct, and abnormal egg production in mature hens resulting in economic losses. IBV also replicates in tracheal and renal epithelial cells leading to prominent tracheal and kidney lesions. Virus undergoes spontaneous mutation leading to continual emergence of new variants. The effectiveness of immunization program is diminished because of poor cross-protection among the serotypes. Identification of circulating serotypes is important in controlling IBV infection. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR21 are involved in early recognition of virus resulting in induction of inflammatory cytokines. Both humoral and cellular immune responses are important in the control of infection. Humoral immunity plays an important role in recovery and clearance of viral infection. IBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes induce lysis of IBV-infected cells. Effective diagnostic tools are required at field level to identify different IBV variants. Embryonated chicken eggs are effective model for virus isolation. Identification by other specific methods like virus neutralization (VN), hemagglutination inhibition (HI), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunohistochemistry, or nucleic acid analysis or by electron microscopy is also indispensable. VN test in tracheal organ culture is the best method for antigenic typing for surveillance purposes. Continuous epidemiological surveillance, strict biosecurity measures, and vaccine effective against various serotypes are necessary for controlling IB in chickens.","Ramakrishnan, Saravanan; Kappala, Deepthi",Recent Advances in Animal Virology,155,1

The resulting neutropenia as well as injury to the pulmonary and gastrointestinal mucosa allow pathogenic micro-organisms easy access to the body. The symptoms of an incipient infection are usually subtle and limited to unexplained fever due to the absence of granulocytes. This is the reason why prompt administration of antimicrobial agents while waiting for the results of the blood cultures, the so-called empirical approach, became an undisputed standard of care. Gram-negative pathogens remain the principal concern because their virulence accounts for serious morbidity and a high early mortality rate. Three basic intravenous antibiotic regimens have evolved: initial therapy with a single antipseudomonal β-lactam, the so-called monotherapy; a combination of two drugs: a β-lactam with an aminoglycoside, a second β-lactam or a quinolone; and, thirdly, a glycopeptide in addition to β-lactam monotherapy or combination. As there is no single consistently superior empirical regimen, one should consider the local antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates in the selection of the initial antibiotic regimen. Not all febrile neutropenic patients carry the same risk as those with fever only generally respond rapidly, whereas those with a clinically or microbiologically documented infection show a much slower reaction and less favorable response rate. Once an empirical antibiotic therapy has been started, the patient must be monitored continuously for nonresponse, emergence of secondary infections, adverse effects, and the development of drug-resistant organisms. The averageduration of fever in serious infections in eventually successfully treated neutropenic patients is 4–5 days. Adaptations of an antibiotic regimen in a patient who is clearly not responding is relatively straightforward when a micro-organism has been isolated; the results of the cultures, supplemented by susceptibility testing, will assist in selecting the proper antibiotics. The management of febrile patients with pulmonary infiltrates is complex. Bronchoscopy and a high resolution computer-assisted tomographic scan represent the cornerstones of all diagnostic procedures, supplemented by serological tests for relevant viral pathogens and for aspergillosis. Fungi have been found to be responsible for two thirds of all superinfections that may surface during broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment of neutropenic patients. Antibiotic treatment is usually continued for a minimum of 7 days or until culture results indicate that the causative organism has been eradicated and the patient is free of major signs and symptoms. If a persistently neutropenic patient has no complaints and displays no evidence of infection, early watchful cessation of antibiotic therapy or a change to the oral regimen should be considered.","Herbers, Alexandra; de Pauw, Ben E.",Managing Infections in Patients With Hematological Malignancies,155,1

Although the immune response is associated with beneficial effects at the site of injury including the elimination of exogenous and endogenous danger molecules as well as the initiation of regenerative processes, an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response significantly contributes to posttraumatic complications such as multiple organ failure (MOF) and early death. Besides pre-existing physical conditions, age, gender, and underlying comorbidities, surgical and anesthesiological management after injury is decisive for outcome. Improvements in surgical intensive care have increased number of patients who survive the initial phase after trauma. However, instead of progressing to normal recovery, patients often pass into persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS). The characterization and management of PICS will require new strategies for direct monitoring and therapeutic intervention into the patient’s immune function.

Business Process Management (BPM) and the governance thereof offer such organizations a framework of management practices within which to achieve this goal. The objectives of this study were to identify and describe the BPM governance challenges that constrain BPM in large South African corporates as BPM in South Africa had not previously received any comprehensive BPM governance focus. Additionally, the BPM and BPM governance bodies of knowledge lack literature on studies focused on BPM governance challenges. Qualitative research methods were utilized to collect useful and descriptive data through secondary document collection and interviews in a single case study. The study confirmed eight of the literature-identified governance challenge themes that constrain BPM and contributed eleven new BPM governance challenge themes to the BPM and BPM governance body of research.","Doyle, Carmen; Seymour, Lisa F.","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",155,5

Importantly, we not only define the theoretical dimensions of these innovation processes but also the functional outputs in the form of tangible technologies/devices. But while the intellectual components of these processes are critical, what does this mean for the future of humanitarian medicine and innovation? The fact of the matter is that the deployment of innovation processes in conflict and crisis situations will likely consist of an amalgam of these processes that is utilized as a catalyst for high-functioning problem-solving in the field. The reality is that crisis and conflict situations are not black and white; thus the solutions developed in the field are likely to reflect this. This is where we examine the field-based applications of these technologies and their specific capacities to preserve human life. But before we delve into these medical devices, who are these devices meant for? There are three critical stakeholders in any humanitarian healthcare operation: humanitarian practitioners (i.e., doctors, nurses, aides, relief workers), community health workers (i.e., frontline public health workers from indigenous communities), and crisis-stricken communities themselves. While the scope and capacity to utilize devices varies among these groups, nonetheless, it is vital that each one of these stakeholders be properly retrofitted with the most basic of equipment, technology, and devices. In this book we take this a step further and examine how we can not only enhance the retrofitting of humanitarian operators but also their respective problem-solving and innovation processes to create “adaptive solutions.” We define these as high-utility, unconventional solutions that are derived in resource-poor settings. The reality is that while we can provide frugal devices to individuals, how do we stimulate continued innovation and the implementation of adaptive solutions on the ground? The innovation process is just as important as the device itself—a paradigm that is often overlooked.","Ramadurai, Krish W.; Bhatia, Sujata K.",Reimagining Innovation in Humanitarian Medicine,155,1

Most of these cases go undetected and untreated. The expanding use of social media has the potential to leverage the early identification of mental health diseases. As data gathered via social media are already digital, they have the ability to power up faster automatic analysis. In this article we evaluate the impact that psycholinguistic patterns can have on a standard machine learning approach for classifying depressed users based on their writings in an online public forum. We combine psycholinguistic features in a rule-based estimator and we evaluate their impact on this classification problem, along with three other standard classifiers. Our results on the Reddit Self-reported Depression Diagnosis dataset outperform some previously reported works on the same dataset. They stand for the importance of extracting psychologically motivated features when processing social media texts with the purpose of studying mental health.","Trifan, Alina; Antunes, Rui; Matos, Sérgio; Oliveira, Jose Luís",Advances in Information Retrieval,155,1

This chapter concentrates on the pathology of the more common pathogens of the laboratory rat. Based on serologic surveys, parvo viruses are some of the most common viral pathogens in wild and laboratory rat. In general, there are three main serogroups, including Rat virus (RV), H-1 virus, and Ratparvovirus (RPV). Both RPV and RV are tropic for many of the same tissues and they both may result in a persistent infection. However, RPV is antigenically and genetically distinct from RV, and it apparently does not cause clinical signs or lesions in infant rats. M. pulmonis causes natural disease in rats and mice. The infection in young rats is usually clinically silent. In older rats, there are nonspecific clinical signs such as snuffling, chromodacryorrhea, and face and ear rubbing. Several bacteria of the genus Streptococcus can cause clinical disease in rats. All of the streptococci of concern in rats are Gram-positive cocci, and are catalase-negative, nonfermentative, and generally nonmotile. Cilia-associated respiratory bacillus has been identified in rats. In rats, infection is usually asymptomatic although nonspecific clinical signs, such as weight loss and dyspnea, may be observed.","Gaillard, Elias T; Clifford, Charles B",The Laboratory Rat,155,1

The scientific basis for prevention and treatment of virus diseases are also explained. Virus infection is a complex, multistage interaction between the virus and the host organism. The patterns of virus infection can be divided into these types: abortive, acute, chronic, pertinent, and latent. The course and eventual outcome of any infection are the results of a balance between host and virus processes. The host factors involved include exposure to different routes of virus transmission and the control of virus replication by the immune response. Virus processes include the initial infection of the host, its spread throughout the host, and the regulation of gene expression to evade the immune response. The chapter also discusses the virus infections of plants, immune responses to virus infections in animals, apoptosis (programmed cell death), interferons (the blocking of virus infection), and evasion of immune responses. Medical intervention against virus infections includes the use of vaccines to stimulate the immune response and drugs to inhibit virus replication. Molecular biology is stimulating the production of a new generation of antiviral drugs and vaccines.","Cann, Alan J.",Principles of Molecular Virology,155,17

It has also been grown experimentally in the United States. Ancient historical manuscripts from China, India and Greece mention its use for symptoms of viral respiratory tract infections and hepatitis. The plant has also been described by Theophrastus. Licorice from Egypt has been described to be the best, followed by from Iraq and Syria; the root should be decorticated before use. It concocts viscid humours in diseases of liver, bladder and lungs, and expectorates them. It has been used in Iranian herbal medicine for skin eruptions, including dermatitis, eczema, pruritus and cysts, and for treatment of stomach disorders including peptic ulcers. The herb extract inhibits gastric motility in vivo, which is regarded to be an important aspect for its antiulcer activity. Licorice possesses both anti-inflammatory and antiulcer activities; whereas most anti-inflammatory agents are ulcerogenic. Former German Commission E believed it to be effective in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Licorice root has been used for years to regulate gastrointestinal function in TCM, has been used for generations as an antidote, demulcent, and elixir in folk medicine of China, and is the most commonly used crude drug in Kampo Medicines, the Japanese form of modified TCM, for the treatment of peptic ulcer. Roots contain glycyrrhizin, the main water-soluble constituent that is 50× sweeter than sugar, 2-β-glucuronosyl glucuronic acid, and isoliquiritigenin-4-glucoside. Glycyrrhizin is a nonhemolytic saponin with foaming property, and one of the most potent hydroxyl radical scavengers. No significant effect of deglycyrrhizinised liquorice was observed on gastric ulcer in an RCT of British patients. Treatment of healthy men with licorice for one-week decreased salivary testosterone values by 26% but no significant decrease in free testosterone, and nine healthy women treated with licorice daily for two cycles, had their mean total serum testosterone decreased by 37% at the end of 2nd month. This property could be useful as an adjunct therapy of hirsutism and PCOS.","Akbar, Shahid",Handbook of 200 Medicinal Plants,155,17

Apnea testing (AT) is physiologically and practically complex. We sought to review described modifications of AT, safety and complication rates, monitoring techniques, performance of AT on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and other relevant considerations regarding AT. We conducted a systematic scoping review to answer these questions by searching the literature on AT in English language available in PubMed or EMBASE since 1980. Pediatric or animal studies were excluded. A total of 87 articles matched our inclusion criteria and were qualitatively synthesized in this review. A large body of the literature on AT since its inception addresses a variety of modifications, monitoring techniques, complication rates, ways to perform AT on ECMO, and other considerations such as variability in protocols, lack of uniform awareness, and legal considerations. Only some modifications are widely used, especially methods to maintain oxygenation, and most are not standardized or endorsed by brain death guidelines. Future updates to AT protocols and strive for unification of such protocols are desirable.

The type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family encompasses several proteases that play critical roles in cancer progression; however, the expression or function of the TTSP TMPRSS13 in carcinogenesis has not been examined. In the present study, we found TMPRSS13 to be differentially expressed at both the transcript and protein levels in human colorectal cancer (CRC). Immunohistochemical analyses revealed consistent high expression of TMPRSS13 protein on the cancer cell surface in CRC patient samples; in contrast, the majority of normal colon samples displayed no detectable expression. On a functional level, TMPRSS13 silencing in CRC cell lines increased apoptosis and impaired invasive potential. Importantly, transgenic overexpression of TMPRSS13 in CRC cell lines increased tolerance to apoptosis-inducing agents, including paclitaxel and HA14-1. Conversely, TMPRSS13 silencing rendered CRC cells more sensitive to these agents. Together, our findings suggest that TMPRSS13 plays an important role in CRC cell survival and in promoting resistance to drug-induced apoptosis; we also identify TMPRSS13 as a potential new target for monotherapy or combination therapy with established chemotherapeutics to improve treatment outcomes in CRC patients.","Varela, Fausto A.; Foust, Victoria L.; Hyland, Thomas E.; Sala-Hamrick, Kimberley E.; Mackinder, Jacob R.; Martin, Carly E.; Murray, Andrew S.; Todi, Sokol V.; List, Karin",Sci Rep,155,19

Though the pandemic leads to a lot of pressure related to instruction, learning, and assessment, it also provides opportunities that are likely to require changes to the current theories and practices as well as the assumptions that are no longer justified. It is hoped that the challenges will motivate our field and the instructional experts to work closely together with the learning and instruction process so that assessment will be better integrated and can provide data‐driven insights related to the sequence and content of instruction based on the diagnosis of students' strengths and weaknesses from assessment data. We expect that the integration of assessment in learning and instruction will definitely exert significant positive impact on learning outcomes. We believe the field will become aware of the assessment issues that teaching at a distance presents and will come up with innovative solutions to the many emerging problems when the world of instruction and learning undergoes significant changes from social distancing.

The release of unique, latent-phase antigens are known to have a protective role in the immune response against Mtb. Although the BCG vaccine has been administered for nine decades to provide immunity against Mtb, the number of TB cases continues to rise, thereby raising doubts on BCG vaccine efficacy. The shortcomings of BCG have been associated with inadequate processing and presentation of its antigens, an inability to optimally activate T cells against Mtb, and generation of regulatory T cells. Furthermore, BCG vaccination lacks the ability to eliminate latent Mtb infection. With these facts in mind, we selected six immunodominant CD4 and CD8 T cell epitopes of Mtb expressed during latent, acute, and chronic stages of infection and engineered a multi-epitope-based DNA vaccine (C6). RESULT: BALB/c mice vaccinated with the C6 construct along with a BCG vaccine exhibited an expansion of both CD4 and CD8 T cell memory populations and augmented IFN-γ and TNF-α cytokine release. Furthermore, enhancement of dendritic cell and macrophage activation was noted. Consequently, illustrating the elicitation of immunity that helps in the protection against Mtb infection; which was evident by a significant reduction in the Mtb burden in the lungs and spleen of C6 + BCG administered animals. CONCLUSION: Overall, the results suggest that a C6 + BCG vaccination approach may serve as an effective vaccination strategy in future attempts to control TB.","Maurya, Sudeep Kumar; Aqdas, Mohammad; Das, Deepjyoti Kumar; Singh, Sanpreet; Nadeem, Sajid; Kaur, Gurpreet; Agrewala, Javed Naim",BMC Infect Dis,155,17

METHODS: Twenty-one patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled at the West District Qingdao Municipal Hospital, the Fifth People's Hospital of Qinghai Province and Jiaozhou Central Hospital. Eleven were family clustered cases and 10 were sporadic cases not associated with family gatherings. RESULTS: Ten patients were male and 11 were female. The time elapsed onset of fever and cough to diagnosis was 3 to 7 days. The body temperatures of patients fluctuated between 36.7 and 38.9°C. One elderly female patient had no fever. On chest CT, 14 patients with family clustered COVID-19 had bilateral lung lesions. By contrast, 7 patients with no history of familial gatherings showed single lung exudative lesions or consolidation. Seven patients with family clustered COVID-19 had bilateral multiple exudative lesions. Four patients with no history of familial gathering had unilateral lesions. CONCLUSION: Not all patients with COVID-19 have direct epidemiological links to an infected case. They may become infected because of poor protection. In patients with family clustered COVID-19, chest CT often showed multiple exudative lesions in both lungs. In some patients, symptoms may be complicated by influenza virus infection.","Zhan, Bingyan; Lan, Shujuan; La, Zhoucuomao; Li, Deting; Wang, Xinmei; Huang, Xiaochun",J Int Med Res,155,5

Although it is a huge challenge for the whole world, one country is facing it together with a current Ebola outbreak plus violence and some other diseases. The Democratic Republic of Congo is facing the immediate effects of both epidemics as illness and death, however its consequences at the political and economic level are usually more complex and may be protracted. Following the debate on why poor countries remain poor, it is maybe useful to rethink poverty and inequality keeping in mind Amartya Sen's seminal concepts: development must comprise freedom and respect for human rights and institutions at the price of fostering a vicious circle of (re)emerging diseases and structural violence. Ebola epidemics, that usually face some challenges when they happen alone, now together with malaria, measles, plague and covid, on top of violence in some areas, the disease sees its protocols harmed: for covid the orientation is to stay isolated, for Ebola the response includes tracking contacts. What means coming with a team to field to do the mapping in the middle of a confinement. The surveillance for such many epidemics on top of violence and humanitarian crisis makes the Democratic Republic of Congo one of the most worrying countries in terms of consequences of the Covid outbreak. KEY MESSAGES: Study of the association between the Covid, Ebola virus disease outbreak and the at-risk population living in the conflict zone in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The study presents the difficulties that the population encountered in the face of restrictions imposed by armed groups to reach health services during an Ebola outbreak, in a conflict zone.","Amorim Tomaz, A; Bastos, F I P M; Santos, R S; Mossoko, M",Eur J Public Health,155,1

This tax was introduced against the backdrop of South Africa having a large sugar production and SSB manufacturing industry, as well as very high unemployment rates. The introduction of fiscal measures, such as a SSB tax, has been met with well-coordinated and funded opposition in other countries. METHODS: The aim of this study is to describe and analyse the arguments and strategies utilised by industry during policymaking processes to oppose regulatory actions in LMIC. This study analyses arguments and strategies used by the beverage and related industries during the public consultation phase of the process to adopt the South African SSB tax. RESULTS: Industry opposition to the SSB tax was comprehensive and employed several tactics. First, industry underscored its economic importance and the potential job losses and other economic harms that may arise from the tax. This argument was well-received by policymakers, and similar to industry tactics employed in other middle income countries like Mexico. Second, industry discussed self-regulation and voluntary measures as a form of policy substitution, which mirrors industry responses in the US, the Caribbean and Latin America. Third, industry misused or disputed evidence to undermine the perceived efficacy of the tax. Finally, considerations for small business and their ability to compete with multi-national corporations were a unique feature of industry response. CONCLUSIONS: Industry opposition followed both general trends, and also introduced nuanced and context-specific arguments. The industry response experienced in South Africa can be instructive for other countries contemplating the introduction of similar measures.

Clinical impact of Tocilizumab therapy in SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections in ICU and non-ICU patients,13.507222,12.213133,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The anti-interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab has been proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia although the efficacy remains unknown. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 confirmed by nasal swab PCR for SARS-CoV-2 who were admitted to Stony Brook University Hospital in Suffolk County, New York between March 10(th) and April 2(nd) and received tocilizumab while undergoing mechanical ventilation in any intensive care unit were retrospectively analyzed from data available in the electronic medical record. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared to mechanically ventilated patients admitted during the same time period who received standard hospital protocol. RESULTS: Forty-five patients received tocilizumab compared to seventy controls. Mean dose of tocilizumab given was 4.8mg/kg and mean time to receipt from initial intubation was 2.5 days. Baseline demographic characteristics, inflammatory markers, treatment with corticosteroids, and SOFA scores were similar between the two cohorts (Table 1). Patients who received tocilizumab had significantly lower Charlson co-morbidity index (2.0 versus 3.0, p = 0.01) and higher temperature (38.7 C versus 38.2 C, p = 0.004) than controls. There was no significant association between receipt of tocilizumab and the rate of extubation within fourteen days (44.4 percent versus 34.2 percent; OR = 1.53, 95% C.I. 0.71 – 3.30), discharge from hospital (51.1 percent versus 40.0 percent; OR = 1.568, 95% C.I. 0.737 – 3.337), or mortality (31.1 percent versus 41.4 percent; OR = 0.639, 95% C.I. 0.290 – 1.4407) (Table 2). Patients who were administered tocilizumab within two days of intubation had increased likelihood of extubation within fourteen days compared to those who were treated later (OR = 3.50, 95% C.I. 1.01 – 12.18). There was no observed increased risk of secondary infection in patients given tocilizumab (28.9 versus 25.7, OR = 1.1736, 95% C.I. = 0.507 – 2.714). Table 1: Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics [Image: see text] Table 2: Primary Outcomes [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab was not associated with a significant improvement in rate of extubation, hospital discharge, or reduction in mortality in this retrospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Most are associated with mild upper respiratory tract infections (RTIs) but can be associated serious disease. More recently, novel coronaviruses associated with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 have emerged and are often associated with serious disease and death. With this report, we compare presenting clinical characteristics and some outcomes of patients hospitalized with RTIs caused by ECs or by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). METHODS: Patients admitted to the Summa Health System with RTIs associated with EC were identified via multiplex PCR method (BioFire™). Patients admitted with COVID-19 were identified by real-time, reverse transcriptase-PCR method using one of several platforms. Patients were selected from two existing quality improvement registries encompassing EC and COVID-19 cases. We compared clinical characteristics and outcomes of EC patients to those of COVID-19 patients using chi-squared tests for proportions and independent samples t-tests for means. RESULTS: Shown in Table 1. Significant differences in patient characteristics with EC vs. COVID-19 included: older age, primarily Caucasian, smoking history, requiring O2 supplementation on admission, and having chronic heart, lung, or renal disease. Significant differences in patient characteristics with COVID-19 vs. EC included: admission from extended care facility, obesity, presenting with fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and/or myalgia, presence of radiographic infiltrates, abnormal liver tests, and longer length of stay (LOS). A non-significant difference was noted in 30 day mortality rates. Coronavirus OC43 accounted for 54% of EC strains. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: There were significant differences in clinical characteristics between the two groups with EC patients more likely to have lung disease (often COPD) and requiring admission for need of O2 supplementation. COVID-19 patients were more likely to present with a febrile illness associated with pneumonia and require longer LOS (often requiring O2 supplementation later in hospitalization). Patients admitted with COVID-19 present with different clinical characteristics than those with EC with numerically higher mortality rate.

As of 20 July 2020, the virus now known as SARS-CoV-2 has already infected more than 14 million individuals and killed 612,815 patients with a mortality rate of 4.12% around the world regardless of age, gender, and race. MAIN BODY: Bangladesh has become one of its worst sufferers, with 207,453 infected people and 2668 related deaths with a mortality rate of 1.29% until 20 July 2020. More than 50% of COVID-19 patients in Bangladesh are aged between 21 and 40, but elderly people aged more than 60 have the highest mortality rate (44.7%). Male individuals are also more susceptible to the virus than females and consist of 71% and 79% among the infected and deceased patients, respectively. The most prevalent clinical features following the virus incubation period are fever, fatigue, and dry cough. A phylogenetic analysis study elucidated that the virus strain found in the country has 9 single-nucleotide variants, mostly in the ORF1ab gene, and a sequence containing 3 successive variants in the N protein, which reflects a weaker strain of SARS-CoV-2, implicating a possibility of its lower mortality rate. Another investigation of 184 genome samples of SARS-CoV-2 across the country implicated a close homology with a European haplotype of SARS-CoV-2. The country has also joined the race of vaccine development and started phase III clinical trials of a candidate vaccine developed by Sinovac Research and Development Co Ltd, China. CONCLUSION: Bangladesh, as a developing country, still struggles with the pandemic and needs to scale up its response operation and improve healthcare facilities such as testing capacity, institutional quarantine, and isolation centers and promote awareness. Preventive measures such as strict lockdown, social distancing, and boosting the existing immune system are thus considered the only contrivances.","Al Noman, Abdullah; Islam, Md.

This paper aims to enhance the understanding of high-tech born global companies in Malaysia by looking at the role of technological capabilities among high-tech born global companies’ early internationalization in Malaysia. Although the innovation and technological capabilities have been the subject of inquiry by prior studies, very little research however have been done into the role of technological capabilities. Multiple case analysis was used to explore the role of technological capabilities towards the early internationalization of high-tech born global companies in Malaysia. The results of the study show that all three technical capabilities: technical knowledge, supporting technological tools and technology partners have a positive influence on early internationalization in Malaysia. However, technical knowledge and technological tools seems more important for these companies in Malaysia to expand their businesses into the international market. This study contributes to the field in several ways. First, it provides empirical research on internationalization by looking at the early internationalization that have been used in Malaysia and secondly, the study provides a model that explains how technological capabilities are used under the resource-based view theoretical lens.","Uthamaputhran, Sathiswaran; Zaato, Solomon Gbene; Zainol, Noor Raihani; Sabri, Nur Ain Ayunni; Said, Nadzirah bt Mohd",The Importance of New Technologies and Entrepreneurship in Business Development: In The Context of Economic Diversity in Developing Countries,155,31

In specific application areas, dedicated contract theories formalise the notion of contract and the operations on contracts in a manner that supports best the development of systems in that area. At the other end, contract meta-theories attempt to provide a systematic view on the various contract theories by axiomatising their desired properties. However, there exists a noticeable gap between the most well-known contract meta-theory of Benveniste et al. [5], which focuses on the design of embedded and cyber-physical systems, and the established way of using contracts when developing general software, following Meyer’s design-by-contract methodology [18]. At the core of this gap appears to be the notion of procedure: while it is a central unit of composition in software development, the meta-theory does not suggest an obvious way of treating procedures as components. In this paper, we provide a first step towards a contract theory that takes procedures as the basic building block, and is at the same time an instantiation of the meta-theory. To this end, we propose an abstract contract theory for sequential programming languages with procedures, based on denotational semantics. We show that, on the one hand, the specification of contracts of procedures in Hoare logic, and their procedure-modular verification, can be cast naturally in the framework of our abstract contract theory. On the other hand, we also show our contract theory to fulfil the axioms of the meta-theory. In this way, we give further evidence for the utility of the meta-theory, and prepare the ground for combining our instantiation with other, already existing instantiations.","Lidström, Christian; Gurov, Dilian",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,155,11

However, despite the high interest in the logic in recent years, the topic of their quantitative extensions is not yet fully explored. The main goal of this work is to study the effect of adding weak forms of percentage constraints (e.g. that most of the positions in the past satisfy a given condition, or that [Formula: see text] is the most-frequent letter occurring in the past) to fragments of LTL. Such extensions could potentially be used for the verification of influence networks or statistical reasoning. Unfortunately, as we prove in the paper, it turns out that percentage extensions of even tiny fragments of LTL have undecidable satisfiability and model-checking problems. Our undecidability proofs not only sharpen most of the undecidability results on logics with arithmetics interpreted on words known from the literature, but also are fairly simple. We also show that the undecidability can be avoided by restricting the allowed usage of the negation, and discuss how the undecidability results transfer to first-order logic on words.","Bednarczyk, Bartosz; Michaliszyn, Jakub",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,155,10

58013,58013,58013,Quorum Sensing Inhibitors: Curbing Pathogenic Infections through Inhibition of Bacterial Communication,13.615401,6.7889323,2021,"In Slovakia, 22 tick species have been found to occur to date. Among them, Ixodes ricinus, Dermacentor reticulatus, D. marginatus and marginally Haemaphysalis concinna, H. inermis and H. punctata have been identified as the species of public health relevance. Ticks in Slovakia were found to harbour and transmit zoonotic and/or potentially zoonotic agents such as tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), spirochaetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) complex, the relapsing fever sprirochaete Borrelia miyamotoi, bacteria belonging to the orders Rickettsiales (Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Neoehrlichia mikurensis), Legionellales (Coxiella burnetii), and Thiotrichales (Francisella tularensis), and Babesia spp. parasites (order Piroplasmida). Ixodes ricinus is the principal vector of the largest variety of microorganisms including viruses, bacteria and piroplasms. TBEV, B. burgdorferi s.l., rickettsiae of the spotted fever group, C. burnetii and F. tularensis have been found to cause serious diseases in humans, whereas B. miyamotoi, A. phagocytophilum, N. mikurensis, Babesia microti, and B. venatorum pose lower or potential risk to humans. Distribution of TBEV has a focal character. During the last few decades, new tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) foci and their spread to new areas have been registered and TBE incidence rates have increased. Moreover, Slovakia reports the highest rates of alimentary TBE infections among the European countries. Lyme borreliosis (LB) spirochaetes are spread throughout the distribution range of I. ricinus. Incidence rates of LB have shown a slightly increasing trend since 2010. Only a few sporadic cases of human rickettsiosis, anaplasmosis and babesiosis have been confirmed thus far in Slovakia. The latest large outbreaks of Q fever and tularaemia were recorded in 1993 and 1967, respectively. Since then, a few human cases of Q fever have been reported almost each year. Changes in the epidemiological characteristics and clinical forms of tularaemia have been observed during the last few decades. Global changes and development of modern molecular tools led to the discovery and identification of emerging or new tick-borne microorganisms and symbionts with unknown zoonotic potential. In this review, we provide a historical overview of research on ticks and tick-borne pathogens in Slovakia with the most important milestones and recent findings, and outline future directions in the investigation of ticks as ectoparasites and vectors of zoonotic agents and in the study of tick-borne diseases.","Stanko, Michal; Derdáková, Markéta; Špitalská, Eva; Kazimírová, Mária",Biologia (Bratisl),155,1

Spinal anesthesia is preferred by many practices but can delay ambulation, especially with bupivacaine. Mepivacaine, an intermediate-acting local anesthetic, could enable earlier ambulation than bupivacaine. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that patients who received mepivacaine would ambulate earlier than those who received hyperbaric or isobaric bupivacaine for primary total hip arthroplasty. METHODS This randomized controlled trial included American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status I to III patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty. The patients were randomized 1:1:1 to 52.5 mg of mepivacaine, 11.25 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine, or 12.5 mg of isobaric bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia. The primary outcome was ambulation between 3 and 3.5 h. Secondary outcomes included return of motor and sensory function, postoperative pain, opioid consumption, transient neurologic symptoms, urinary retention, intraoperative hypotension, intraoperative muscle tension, same-day discharge, length of stay, and 30-day readmissions. RESULTS Of 154 patients, 50 received mepivacaine, 53 received hyperbaric bupivacaine, and 51 received isobaric bupivacaine. Patient characteristics were similar among groups. For ambulation at 3 to 3.5 h, 35 of 50 (70.0%) of patients met this endpoint in the mepivacaine group, followed by 20 of 53 (37.7%) in the hyperbaric bupivacaine group, and 9 of 51 (17.6%) in the isobaric bupivacaine group (P < 0.001). Return of motor function occurred earlier with mepivacaine. Pain and opioid consumption were higher for mepivacaine patients in the early postoperative period only. For ambulatory status, 23 of 50 (46.0%) of mepivacaine, 13 of 53 (24.5%) of hyperbaric bupivacaine, and 11 of 51 (21.5%) of isobaric bupivacaine patients had same-day discharge (P = 0.014). Length of stay was shortest in mepivacaine patients. There were no differences in transient neurologic symptoms, urinary retention, hypotension, muscle tension, or dizziness. CONCLUSIONS Mepivacaine patients ambulated earlier and were more likely to be discharged the same day than both hyperbaric bupivacaine and isobaric bupivacaine patients. Mepivacaine could be beneficial for outpatient total hip arthroplasty candidates if spinal is the preferred anesthesia type. : WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: Early ambulation after total hip arthroplasty is key to achieving readiness for dischargeThe spinal anesthetic for total hip arthroplasty that balances pain control with timely resolution of motor block has not been identified WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: In this randomized, three-arm study involving 154 patients, more individuals in the mepivacaine spinal group ambulated 3 to 3.5 h after injection than did individuals in either the isobaric or hyperbaric bupivacaine groupLikewise, more patients in the mepivacaine group achieved same-day discharge than patients in the other experimental groups.","Schwenk, Eric S; Kasper, Vincent P; Smoker, Jordan D; Mendelson, Andrew M; Austin, Matthew S; Brown, Scot A; Hozack, William J; Cohen, Alexa J; Li, Jonathan J; Wahal, Christopher S; Baratta, Jaime L; Torjman, Marc C; Nemeth, Alyson C; Czerwinski, Eric E",Anesthesiology,155,1

METHODS This study examined global investments into blast injury-related research from public and philanthropic funders across 2000-2019. Research databases were searched using keywords, and open data were extracted from funder websites. Data collected included study title, abstract, award amount, funder and year. Individual awards were categorised to compare amounts invested into different blast injuries, the scientific approaches taken and analysis of research investment into blast traumatic brain injury (TBI). RESULTS A total of 806 awards were identified into blast injury-related research globally, equating to US$902.1 million (m, £565.9m GBP). There was a general increase in year-on-year investment between 2003 and 2009 followed by a consistent decline in annual funding since 2010. Pre-clinical research received $671.3 m (74.4%) of investment. Brain-related injury research received $427.7 m (47.4%), orthopaedic injury $138.6 m (15.4%), eye injury $63.7 m (7.0%) and ear injury $60.5m (6.7%). Blast TBI research received a total investment of $384.3 m, representing 42.6% of all blast injury-related research. The U.S. Department of Defense funded $719.3 m (80%). CONCLUSIONS Investment data suggest that blast TBI research has received greater funding than other blast injury health areas. The funding pattern observed can be seen as reactive, driven by the response to the War on Terror, the rising profile of blast TBI and congressionally mandated research.","Denny, J W; Brown, R J; Head, M G; Batchelor, J; Dickinson, A S",BMJ military health,155,31

However, data are lacking on its efficacy for the treatment of chronic cancer pain. The purpose of this study was to determine the analgesic efficacy of pregabalin combined with morphine in the management of pancreatic cancer pain. METHODS This study reviewed patients who were prescribed morphine and 150 mg/d pregabalin between 1 January 2017 and 10 November 2018 in our institute. The primary outcomes of this study were the average pain score and dose of morphine. Secondary outcomes included characters of breakthrough cancer pain, functional interference related to pain, anxiety/depression status, and incidence of treatment-related adverse events during the study. RESULTS A total of 240 patients with pain related to pancreatic cancer were included in the study. The results showed that patients of both combination therapy group (pregabalin+morphine) and monotherapy group (morphine) achieved similar analgesic efficacy, demonstrated by NRS (2.4 ± 0.9 vs. 2.6 ± 0.9; combination vs. monotherapy) at the end of the study. Mean daily dose of morphine used in the combination group was significant lower compared to monotherapy group (39.5 ± 16.0 mg vs. 61.5 ± 19.3 mg, net difference 23.5, 95% CI: 18.4-28.6, p < 0.001). The change of functional interference score related to pain was significantly different between combination and monotherapy group (12.0 ± 0.4 vs. 9.8 ± 4.9; net difference, 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1-3.3; p < 0.001). Patients in combination therapy group had experienced shorter duration of breakthrough cancer pain than those in monotherapy group (X2 p < 0.001, Cramer's V:0.36). The incidence of somnolence, dizziness, and cognitive dysfunction were significantly higher in the combination group compared to monotherapy group. No serious treatment-related side effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study supported the use of pregabalin with morphine to relieve pain in patients of pancreatic cancer.","Dai, Junzhu; Teng, Lei; Zhao, Liuyuan; Zou, Huichao",Cancer medicine,155,16

CASE PRESENTATION An 82-years-old man with history of HCC with hepatitis C virus-related liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B). The patient was treated RFA to HCC for segment 4, 5, 6, 8. After 16 months from latest RFA for segment 8, the patient was admitted to our hospital because of mild dyspnea. Computed tomography revealed a diaphragmatic herniation of bowel loops into the right thoracic cavity. The patients electively underwent laparoscopic repair of the diaphragmatic hernia. The patient was discharged from hospital without any post-operative complications. CLINICAL DISCUSSION The only treatment to diaphragmatic hernia is surgery, but liver cirrhosis patients limits this possibility. For the surgical treatment of patients with severe cirrhosis, the operation should be carefully assessed. We believe that a laparoscopic approach should be used for repairing diaphragmatic hernia. In the present case, we considered that a laparoscopic approach was safer and more feasible than open laparotomy. CONCLUSION Diaphragmatic hernia is a rare late-onset complication associated with RFA for HCC. And patients with HCC often have severe liver dysfunction and cirrhosis. A laparoscopic approach is safe and minimally invasive for sever cirrhosis patients.","Ushijima, Hokuto; Hida, Jin-Ichi; Yane, Yoshinori; Kato, Hiroaki; Ueda, Kazuki; Kawamura, Junichiro",International journal of surgery case reports,155,27

However, in a few cases, the treatment is difficult due to artery tortuosity or other factors. The authors present a case of a 94-year-old man presenting with acute right middle cerebral artery occlusion. We attempted to treat using a stent retriever via transfemoral approach, but failed to advance the guiding catheter into the right internal carotid artery due to femoral artery tortuosity and a type III arch. By changing approaches from transfemoral to transbrachial and by using TrevoProVue through a 4.2 Fr Simmons-type catheter without a guiding catheter, we were able to achieve rapid recanalization in only 26 minutes from brachial artery puncture to reperfusion. In conclusion, rapid reperfusion in an AIS patient was successfully achieved by combining a stent retriever with a 4.2 Fr catheter (without a guiding catheter) and a transbrachial approach (as opposed to a transfemoral approach). When the transfemoral approach is not feasible, we recommend consideration of this strategy as an alternative.","Yamaguchi, Susumu; Horie, Nobutaka; Morofuji, Yoichi; Satoh, Kei; Suyama, Kazuhiko",NMC case report journal,155,28

Morbilliviruses have a severe impact on humans and animal species. They confer diseases which have contributed to morbidity and mortality of the population on a global scale. There is substantial evidence from both natural and experimental infections that morbilliviruses can readily cross species barriers. Of most concern with regard to zoonosis is the more recently reported fatal infection of primates in Japan and China with strains of CDV which have adapted to this host. The close genetic relationship, shared cell entry receptors and similar pathogenesis between the morbilliviruses highlights the potential consequences of complete withdrawal of MV vaccination after eradication. Therefore, it would be prudent to continue the current MV vaccination. Ultimately development of novel, safe vaccines which have higher efficacy against the veterinary morbilliviruses is a priority.

We investigated patient parameters upon hospital admission to predict MP infection. Methods All patients hospitalized in a tertiary care hospital between 2013 and 2017 for CAP with a confirmed etiology were analyzed using logistic regression analyses and area under the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves (AUC) for associations between demographic, clinical and laboratory features and the causative pathogen. Results We analyzed 568 patients with CAP, including 47 (8%) with MP; 152 (27%) with SP and 369 (65%) with influenza or other viruses. Comparing MP and SP by multivariate logistic regression analysis, younger age (odds ration [OR] 0.56 per 10 years, 95% CI 0.42-0.73), a lower neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (OR 0.9, 0.82-0.99) and an elevated C-reactive protein/procalcitonin (CRP/PCT) ratio (OR 15.04 [5.23-43.26] for a 400 mg/μg cut-off) independently predicted MP. With a ROC curve AUC of 0.91 (0.80 for the >400 mg/μg cutoff), the CRP/PCT ratio was the strongest predictor of MP vs. SP. The discriminatory value resulted from significantly lower PCT values (p < 0.001) for MP, while CRP was high in both groups (p = 0.057). Comparing MP and viral infections showed similar results with again the CRP/PCT ratio providing the best information (AUC 0.83; OR 5.55 for the >400 mg/μg cutoff, 2.26-13.64). Conclusions In patients hospitalized with CAP, a high admission CRP/PCT ratio predicts M. pneumoniae infection and may improve empiric management.","Neeser, Olivia L; Vukajlovic, Tanja; Felder, Laetitia; Haubitz, Sebastian; Hammerer-Lercher, Angelika; Ottiger, Cornelia; Mueller, Beat; Schuetz, Philipp; Fux, Christoph A",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,155,31

Such repairs are prone to failure, particularly with low pressure venous flow (bidirectional cavopulmonary connection or Fontan). We describe our experience of disconnection of central pulmonary arteries and selective systemic-PA shunt to the hypoplastic vessel. Single ventricle patients (n=12) with diffuse left pulmonary artery (LPA) hypoplasia (LPA:RPA diameter <0.7) underwent PA disconnection (ligation clip) and selective arterial shunt to the LPA. Patients with ≤ mild atrioventricular valve regurgitation (AVVR), and no more than mild systolic dysfunction on echocardiogram were considered. Following systemic-LPA shunt, patients were re-assessed by cardiac catheterisation prior to further surgery, with follow-up catheterisation later performed and description of changes observed. Increased volume loading was well tolerated with no greater than mild AVVR and preserved systolic function (normal or mildly reduced). Selective arterial shunting increased the caliber of the LPA from 4.1 mm (1.2-5.6) to 6.5 mm (1.7-11.9) and this increase was preserved post-Fontan (6.7 mm (1.3-8.0)) (median (range)). Ventricular end diastolic pressure (EDP) increased with arterial shunting but resolved after shunt takedown and Fontan completion (median +3 and -4 mmHg respectively). Post-Fontan hospital length of stay was not prolonged (median 11 days, range 7-14). No deaths occurred. In univentricular hearts and PA hypoplasia, selective systemic-PA shunting physiologically increases the caliber of the distal vessels. In selected patients this can be done safely with maintenance of PA growth and resolution of the elevated EDP with Fontan completion.","Seaman, Cameron S; d'Udekem, Yves; Jones, Bryn; Brizard, Christian; Cheung, Michael M H",Seminars in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,155,16

PDACs fast progression depends on the tumor characteristics and can be influenced by the microenvironment. The antibacterial drug acriflavine (ACF) has been shown to have anti-cancer activities in cell lines. Materials and Methods To understand the working mechanism of ACF on cancer progression and tumor-stromal interplay, we evaluated pancreatic cancer in cell culture (Panc-1) (morphology, cell invasion and RNA expression) and the macrophage cell line THP1 (representing innate immune stromal cells). In the translational arm, the activity of ACF on xenograft models of human PDAC tumors representing different clinical subclasses was investigated (tumor growth, morphology and immunofluorescence, RNA expression and pathway analysis). Results In vitro, ACF reduces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion of Panc-1 cells and shifts macrophage polarization to a M1-like anti-tumoral phenotype. At non-toxic concentrations, ACF downregulates cell metabolism. In xenografts, effect on tumor growth and metabolism could be confirmed; however, the innate immune stromal cells did not respond. Importantly, only in the moderately differentiated PDAC model, ACF could significantly suppress tumor growth and not in the fast-growing EMT-high model. Pathway analysis shows that ACF highly significantly downregulates metabolic pathways, especially OXPHOS and MYC/cell proliferation pathways in xenografts. Conclusion ACF, with known pleiotropic effects on cancer cells, is in this study shown to be an attractive therapeutic based on its novel observed metabolic activity. Repurposing this compound for cancer treatment should be in the setting with other targeting agents, which offers reduced chance of resistance development in PDAC. Further evaluation should best be done in biological complex models such as human xenografts or syngeneic cancer models.","Bulle, Ashenafi; Dekervel, Jeroen; Deschuttere, Lise; Nittner, David; Van Cutsem, Eric; Verslype, Chris; van Pelt, Jos",OncoTargets and therapy,155,7

Several larger database and institutional retrospective studies support the notions that while filters prevent pulmonary embolism, they may be associated with venous thrombotic complications. Some subsets of cancer patients may be at increased risk of these complications, but whether the filter or the underlying hypercoagulable state is the cause is not clear. Lastly, although the benefits of filter retrieval are widely assumed (but not proven), filter retrieval rates remain lower than expected. The single most influential factor in improving filter retrieval rates is dedicated follow-up with intent to retrieve the filter.","Montgomery, Jennifer P; Kaufman, John A",Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicine,155,12

Here, we evaluated the short-term outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted colectomy (LAC) for synchronous double colorectal cancers. Seven patients underwent one-stage LAC that required two resections and anastomoses in our hospital from 2010 to 2014. We retrospectively examined each patient's background and subsequent surgical outcomes. The median age of patients was 78 years, and the median BMI was 19.8 kg/m2 . The median operative time was 190 min, and blood loss was minimal. All resected specimens were extracted through a transumbilical incision. A radical operation was performed safely without procedural accidents or postoperative complications in all cases. The median postoperative hospital stay was 12.5 days. One-stage LAC is considered a safe and viable procedure for resecting synchronous double colorectal cancers. It involves minimal invasiveness and is similar to standard LAC.","Tomioka, Kodai; Murakami, Masahiko; Watanabe, Makoto; Matsui, Nobuaki; Ozawa, Yoshiaki; Yoshizawa, Sota; Koizumi, Tomotake; Goto, Satoru; Fujimori, Akira; Yoshitake, Osamu; Otsuka, Koji; Aoki, Takeshi",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,155,28

We report collected clinical data utilizing a new technique based on combined large lumen aspiration catheter and partially resheathed stent retriever (ARTS: Aspiration (catheter)-(stent) Retriever Technique for Stroke). This technique is applied, especially in presence of bulky/rubbery emboli, when resistance is felt while retracting the stent retriever; at that point the entire assembly is locked and removed in-toto under continuous aspiration with additional flow arrest. METHODS A retrospective data analysis was performed to identify patients with large cerebral artery acute ischemic stroke treated with ARTS. The study was conducted between August 2013 and February 2015 at a single high volume stroke center. Procedural and clinical data were captured for analysis. RESULTS Forty-two patients (median age 66 years) met inclusion criteria for this study. The ARTS was successful in achieving Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) ≥2b revascularization in 97.6% of cases (TICI 2b = 18 patients, TICI 3 = 23 patients). Patients' median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at admission was 18 (6-40). A 3-month follow-up modified Rankin Scale value of 0-2 was achieved in 65.7% of the successfully treated patients (average 2.4). Two patients (4.8%) developed symptomatic intraparenchymal hemorrhages. Six procedure unrelated deaths were observed. CONCLUSIONS We found that ARTS is a fast, safe and effective method for endovascular recanalization of large vessel occlusions presenting within the context of acute ischemic stroke.","Massari, Francesco; Henninger, Nils; Lozano, Juan Diego; Patel, Anand; Kuhn, Anna Luisa; Howk, Mary; Perras, Mary; Brooks, Christopher; Gounis, Matthew J; Kan, Peter; Wakhloo, Ajay K; Puri, Ajit S","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",155,24

Some studies suggest a higher risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia in this specific population. DESIGN Cohort exposed/nonexposed study among the REA-REZO surveillance network. SETTING Multicentric; ICUs in France. PATIENTS The coronavirus disease 2019 patients at admission were matched on the age, sex, center of inclusion, presence of antimicrobial therapy at admission, patient provenance, time from ICU admission to mechanical ventilation, and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II at admission to the patients included between 2016 and 2019 within the same surveillance network (1:1). INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The overall incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, the cumulative incidence, and hazard rate of the first and the second ventilator-associated pneumonia were estimated. In addition, the ventilator-associated pneumonia microbiological ecology and specific resistant pattern in coronavirus disease 2019 exposed and nonexposed patients were compared. Medication data were not collected. A total of 1,879 patients were included in each group. The overall incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia was higher among coronavirus disease 2019 exposed patients (25.5; 95% CI [23.7-27.45] vs 15.4; 95% CI [13.7-17.3] ventilator-associated pneumonia per 1,000 ventilation days). The cumulative incidence was higher for the first and the second ventilator-associated pneumonia among the coronavirus disease 2019 exposed patients (respective Gray test p < 0.0001 and 0.0167). The microbiological ecology and resistance were comparable between groups with a predominance of Enterobacterales and nonfermenting Gram-negative bacteria. The documented resistance pattern was similar between groups, except for a lower rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the coronavirus disease 2019 exposed patient (6% vs 23%; p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS There was a higher incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia occurring among coronavirus disease 2019 patient compared with the general ICU population, with a similar microbiological ecology and resistance pattern.","Vacheron, Charles-Hervé; Lepape, Alain; Savey, Anne; Machut, Anaïs; Timsit, Jean Francois; Vanhems, Philippe; Le, Quoc Viet; Egbeola, Julia; Martin, Maelle; Maxime, Virginie; Pugliesi, Paul-Simon; Maucort-Boulch, Delphine; Friggeri, Arnaud",Critical care medicine,155,13

To answer this question, we review the effects of early onset disease on clinical course and outcomes, with specific considerations on risks and benefits of treatments for paediatric MS. Considering the impact of disease activity on brain atrophy, cognitive impairment and development of secondary progressive MS at a younger age, we would recommend treating paediatric MS as a highly active disease, favouring the early use of highly effective DMTs rather than injectable DMTs.","Hacohen, Yael; Banwell, Brenda; Ciccarelli, Olga",Multiple sclerosis,155,31

OBJECTIVES The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of AVCs by paramedics with a base physician on the rate of patients treated on site without the need of hospital transfer. The co-primary safety outcome was the frequency of repeated ambulance trips within 48 hours to the same patient. Secondary objective was the qualitative analysis of perception of the AVCs. METHODS During a six-week period, the dispatching center of Karlovy Vary Emergency Medical Service (EMS) randomized low-urgency events from a rural area (n = 791) to receive either a mandatory phone-call consult (PHONE), AVC (VIDEO), or performed by the paramedic crew in a routine manner, when phone-call consultation is for paramedic crew optional (CONTROL). Secondarily, the qualitative analysis of subjective perception of AVCs compared to consultation over the phone by the paramedic and consulting physician was performed. RESULTS Per-protocol analysis (PPA) was performed (CONTROL, n = 258; PHONE, n = 193; and VIDEO, n = 192) in addition to the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Patients (PPA) in both mandatory consulted groups were twice as likely to be treated and left on site compared to the CONTROL (PHONE: OR = 2.07; 95% CI, 1.19 to 3.58; P = 0.01 or VIDEO: OR = 2.01; 95% CI, 1.15 to 3.49; P = .01). Repeated trips to patients treated and left on site in 48 hours occurred in three (8.6%) of 35 cases in the PHONE group and in eight (23.5%) of 34 cases in the VIDEO group. CONCLUSIONS The AVCs of the emergency physician by paramedics was not superior to the mandatory conventional phone call in increasing the proportion of patients treated and left at home after a low-urgency call. The AVC improved the subjective feelings of safety by physicians, but not the satisfaction of patients or paramedics, and may lead to an increased need of repeated trips.","Sykora, Roman; Renza, Metodej; Ruzicka, Jiri; Bakurova, Petra; Kukacka, Milos; Smetana, Jiri; Duska, Frantisek",Prehospital and disaster medicine,155,1

AIM To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of ustekinumab and identify the predictive factors of ustekinumab failure-free persistence in a cohort of anti-TNF refractory CD patients. METHODS We performed a retrospective multicentre cohort study including all consecutive CD patients who began subcutaneous ustekinumab and presented a clinical response (defined as a significant improvement of CD-related clinical symptoms assessed by the patient's physician leading to continued ustekinumab) during the first year of treatment. Primary outcome was treatment failure defined as withdrawal of treatment due to loss of response, intolerance or need for surgery. RESULTS Eighty-eight of the 122 (72%) CD patients beginning ustekinumab from March 2011 to December 2014, responded to ustekinumab and were followed up until November 2016. Median time on ustekinumab was 26.6 (13.4-34.4) months. Forty-seven patients (54%) continued ustekinumab with a clinical response and 38 (43%) stopped treatment (32 for failure, five for remission and one for pregnancy). Endoscopic response was observed in 82% of patients with endoscopic evaluation and mucosal healing in 39%. Ustekinumab failure-free persistence rates were 78% at 12 months, 66% at 24 months and 55% at 36 months. No predictive factor of ustekinumab failure-free persistence was identified.

The aims of this study were to compare treatment outcomes between patients with pancreatic pseudocysts undergoing TMD versus combined (TMD and TPD) drainage (CD) and to identify predictors of symptomatic and radiologic resolution. METHODS This is a retrospective review of 375 consecutive patients with PFCs who underwent EUS-guided TMD from 2008 to 2014 at 15 academic centers in the United States. Main outcome measures included TMD and CD technical success, treatment outcomes (symptomatic and radiologic resolution) at follow-up, and predictors of treatment outcomes on logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 375 patients underwent EUS-guided TMD of PFCs, of which 174 were pseudocysts. TMD alone was performed in 95 (55%) and CD in 79 (45%) pseudocysts. Technical success was as follows: TMD, 92 (97%) versus CD, 35 (44%) (P = .0001). There was no difference in adverse events between the TMD (15%) and CD (14%) cohorts (P = .23). Median long-term (LT) follow-up after transmural stent removal was 324 days (interquartile range, 72-493 days) for TMD and 201 days (interquartile range, 150-493 days) (P = .37). There was no difference in LT symptomatic resolution (TMD, 69% vs CD, 62%; P = .61) or LT radiologic resolution (TMD, 71% vs CD, 67%; P = .79). TPD attempt was negatively associated with LT radiologic resolution of pseudocyst (odds ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.8; P = .03).

The release of NET components from neutrophils is involved in the suppression of pathogen diffusion. Development of NETs around target microbes leads to disruption of the cell membrane, eventuating in kind of cell death that is called as NETosis. The very first step in the process of NETosis is activation of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase upon signaling by innate immune receptors. Afterwards, produced Reactive oxygen species (ROS) trigger protein-arginine deiminase type 4, neutrophil elastase, and myeloperoxidase to generate decondensed chromatin and disrupted integrity of nuclear membrane. Subsequently, decondensed chromatin is mixed with several enzymes in the cytoplasm released from granules, leading to release of DNA and histones, and finally formation of NET. Several reports have indicated that NETosis might contribute to the immune responses through limiting the dissemination of microbial organisms. In this review, we discuss recent advances on the role of neutrophils, NETs, and their implications in the pathogenesis of microbial infections.

Aberrant cathepsin B or L is closely associated with many serious diseases such as cancer, osteoporosis and autoimmune disorders. Therefore, development of potent and selective cathepsin B and L inhibitors has aroused much attention in recent years. Although several classes of cathepsin inhibitors are presently available, there are still some problems to solve, such as broad-spectrum inhibition to protease, specially cysteine proteases, which lead to unpredictable side effects in clinical trials. Therefore, it is very necessary to discovery new scaffolds and new application of cathepsin B and L inhibitors for developing therapeutic agents for treating diseases mediated by cathepsin B or L. Areas covered: This updated review summarizes new patents on cathepsin B and L inhibitors from 2010 to present. Expert opinion: The review gives the latest development in the area of inhibitors of cathepsin B and L, which have been considered key therapeutic targets for the development of drugs treating related diseases.

Flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) is now probably the most frequently used tool for objective dysphagia assessment in Germany. It allows evaluation of the efficacy and safety of swallowing, determination of appropriate feeding strategies and assessment of the efficacy of different swallowing manoeuvres. The literature furthermore indicates that FEES is a safe and well-tolerated procedure. In spite of the huge demand for qualified dysphagia diagnostics in neurology, a systematic FEES education has not yet been established. RESULTS The structured training curriculum presented in this article aims to close this gap and intends to enforce a robust and qualified FEES service. As management of neurogenic dysphagia is not confined to neurologists, this educational programme is applicable to other clinicians and speech-language therapists with expertise in dysphagia as well.

The biosynthetic pathway of PQQ involves a gene cluster composed of 4 to 7 genes, named pqqA-G, among which pqqA is a key gene for PQQ synthesis, encoding the precursor peptide PqqA. To produce recombinant PqqA in E. coli, fusion tags were used to increase the stability and solubility of the peptide, as well simplify the scale-up of the fermentation process. In this paper, pqqA from Gluconobacter oxydans 621H was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as a fusion protein with SUMO and purified using a hexahistidine (His6) tag. The SUMO fusion protein and His6 tag were specifically recognized and cleaved by the SUMO specific ULP protease, and immobilized-metal affinity chromatography was used to obtain high-purity precursor peptide PqqA. Expression and purification of target proteins was confirmed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE. Finally, the synthesis of PQQ in a cell-free enzymatic reaction in vitro was confirmed by LC-MS.","Wang, Guanglu; Zhou, Yifei; Ma, Ke; Zhang, Fan; Ye, Jianbin; Zhong, Guifang; Yang, Xuepeng",Protein expression and purification,155,15

There is a paucity of evidence, however, regarding the hemodynamic effects of prewarming. We hypothesized that the nadir mean arterial pressure during anesthesia induction would be higher after prewarming than after no prewarming. METHODS We randomized 32 patients prior to elective neurosurgery to receive either one hour of forced-air convective warming at 46°C or routine care (full body blanket with convective warmer attached but not turned on). All patients had invasive blood pressure, heart rate, and core temperature monitoring before and during warming and underwent a protocolized intravenous anesthetic induction with propofol and remifentanil target-controlled infusions. The primary endpoint was the nadir mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) during induction. Hypotension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mmHg, MAP < 60 mmHg, or a reduction in either SBP or MAP > 20% from baseline values. RESULTS No difference was found in the mean (SD) nadir MAP between the prewarmed group and the control group [64 (11) mmHg vs 68 (16) mmHg, respectively; mean difference, 5 mmHg; 95% confidence interval (CI), -6 to 15; P = 0.36]. Similarly, there was no difference between groups in the incidence of hypotension (100% of prewarmed vs 93% of control patients; relative risk, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.23; P = 0.32) or in the requirement for vasopressors during induction (four patients in each group required metaraminol; P = 1.00). CONCLUSION Prewarming with convective forced air for one hour prior to intravenous anesthetic induction did not prevent hypotension during the induction period (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry [ANZCTR] ACTRN12615000431527).","Darvall, Jai; Vijayakumar, Rukman; Leslie, Kate",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,155,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS The clinical outcomes from COMPLIANCE 360°, a prospective, multicenter, randomized study comparing OAS+BA vs BA alone for treatment of calcified femoropopliteal lesions, were correlated with cost data and previously published quality of life data. Site of service, hospital charges, and associated medical resource utilization were obtained from Uniform Billing statements for index treatments and associated revascularizations out to 1 year. Hospital costs were estimated using hospital-specific, procedure-specific cost-to-charge ratios. Length of stay and procedural data were collected from participating study sites. RESULTS Twenty-five subjects with 38 lesions and 25 subjects with 27 lesions were randomized to the OAS+BA and BA-alone groups, respectively. Mean hospital charges (US$51,755 vs US$39,922) and estimated hospital costs (US$15,100 vs US$11,016) were higher for OAS+BA compared with BA alone (not statistically significant). Stent utilization was statistically significantly higher with BA-alone treatment for all subjects (1.1 vs 0.1, P=0.001) and in the subset of subjects with one lesion (1.0 vs 0.1, P<0.00001). There was a significant difference in cost for single-lesion versus multiple-lesion treatment. Using costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for the single-lesion cohort, the 1-year incremental cost of OAS+BA vs BA alone was US$549, and incremental QALY was 0.16. This results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$3,441, well below the US$50,000 threshold. CONCLUSION One-year index procedure cost and cost-effectiveness were comparable for OAS+BA vs BA alone. This study provides compelling cost-effectiveness data for using atherectomy for treatment of calcified femoropopliteal lesions, a longstanding challenge for peripheral artery disease interventionalists.","Weinstock, Barry; Dattilo, Raymond; Diage, Tiffini",ClinicoEconomics and outcomes research : CEOR,155,1

Population proteomics addresses the need for individual assessment of proteins across large populations to delineate the existence of structural variations, determine their frequency, and explore the association of the modifications with specific diseases. Besides the basic concepts and underlying reasons for such protein diversity studies, also reviewed here are the results of two fundamental studies that investigated human plasma protein diversity across the healthy population in the United States. Such studies of protein diversity are needed to map all the post-expression protein modifications and determine the wild-type protein profiles, similar to the human diversity studies at the genome level that have helped redefine the ""normal"" human genome.","Nedelkov, Dobrin",Proteomics,155,20

In this case, bispectral index (BIS) monitoring, a specific electroencephalogram-derived monitoring, can be used to find the optimal seizure induction time during anesthesia to elicit adequate seizures. A measurement of seizure adequacy in electroencephalogram is the postictal suppression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of seizure induction time on the degree of postictal suppression by comparing BIS versus no-BIS monitoring in MST and ECT. METHODS Twenty patients with treatment-resistant depression were randomly assigned to either MST or ECT. Each patient underwent 3 treatments with the determination of seizure induction time by defined prestimulation BIS (BIS condition) and 3 treatments with determination of seizure induction time by controlled clinical trial protocol (no-BIS condition). Statistical analysis was calculated by repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS The degree of postictal suppression was more pronounced in both MST and ECT, with BIS monitoring. In this connection, no differences between MST and ECT were found. Seizure induction time was significantly later in the BIS condition (181.3 ± 6 seconds) compared with the no-BIS condition (114.3 ± 12 seconds) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Adequacy of seizures, in the form of the degree of postictal suppression, was superior by determining the seizure induction time with BIS in both MST and ECT. Further research is needed to investigate the correlation between the degree of postictal suppression and treatment response.","Kayser, Sarah; Bewernick, Bettina H; Soehle, Martin; Switala, Christina; Gippert, Sabrina M; Dreimueller, Nadine; Schlaepfer, Thomas E",The journal of ECT,155,33

This review aims to explore children and young people's perceptions of long-term attempts of weight management. Six databases were searched for qualitative studies describing young participants (<25 years, previously or currently above a healthy weight) experiences of weight management for >6 months following intentional weight loss. A thematic synthesis was undertaken. Themes were interpreted using the Socio-ecological Model. Factors supporting attempts to maintain weight loss included having clear motivation for change; developing personal skills to manage the challenges of change; family support/dynamics that encourage healthy lifestyles; and health-promoting cultures in schools/workplaces, communities, and the broader living environment. Conversely, ambivalence, difficulty coping with changes, peer pressure, challenging family dynamics, limited professional support, and unhealthy living environments were barriers to maintaining behavior change. These facilitators and barriers at each level of the Socio-ecological Model informed a model of weight loss maintenance for children and young people. Supporting children, young people, and families to develop the skills to manage the individual, social, and environmental challenges that shape attempts of long-term weight management will help to support their ability to manage their weight long term.","Lang, Sarah; Gibson, Simone; Ng, Ker Wei; Truby, Helen",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,155,1

Originally, it was recognized at autopsy before the application of endomyocardial biopsy, which led to a histopathology-based diagnosis such as in the Dallas criteria. Given the invasive and low-sensitivity nature of endomyocardial biopsy, its diagnostic focus shifted to a reliance on clinical suspicion. With the advances of cardiac magnetic resonance, an examination of the whole heart in vivo has gained acceptance in the pursuit of a diagnosis of myocarditis.

It is known that N501Y and E484K can enhance binding between the coronavirus receptor domain (RBD) and human ACE2. However, the K417N mutation appears to be unfavorable as it removes one interfacial salt bridge. Here, we show that despite the decrease in binding affinity (1.48 kcal/mol) between RBD and ACE2, the K417N mutation abolishes a buried interfacial salt bridge between the RBD and neutralizing antibody CB6. This substantially reduces their binding energy by 9.59 kcal/mol, thus facilitating the process by which the variant efficiently eludes CB6 (including many other antibodies). Our theoretical predictions agree with existing experimental findings. Harnessing the revealed molecular mechanisms makes it possible to redesign therapeutic antibodies, thus making them more efficacious.","Luan, Binquan; Huynh, Tien",Journal of medicinal chemistry,155,8

However, which of these positions is ergonomically better for the operating surgeon is unknown. In this randomized controlled trial (NCT01144325), we aimed to assess the surgeon's physical and mental stress in operating on patients in the PP compared with that in the DP. METHODS From October 2012 to June 2013, 67 consecutive patients who underwent a three-stage minimally invasive esophagectomy were randomly assigned to the DP or the PP during the thoracic stage. The same senior surgeon performed all operations. Objectively, the surgeon's spontaneous eye blink rate was recorded during thoracoscopic esophagectomy. Subjectively, the physician's musculoskeletal symptoms were rated on a scale ranging from 1 (uninfluenced) to 10 (maximum fatigue). Clinical characteristics, including patient demographics and operative features of the two patient groups, were statistically compared. RESULTS There were 35 patients in the PP group and 32 in the DP group. The two groups were comparable in patient demographics. The thoracic stage of the operation was longer in the DP group than in the PP group (87 ± 24 minutes vs 68 ± 22 minutes, p < 0.001), and the volume of blood loss was higher (89 ± 18 mL vs 67 ± 16 mL, p < 0.001). The surgeon's eye blink rate at the end of thoracic stage decreased more from baseline in the DP group than in the PP group (3.0 ± 1.4 blinks/min vs 1.2 ± 0.9 blinks/min, p < 0.001), and the surgeon's symptom scale score was higher after operation with the patient in the DP than in the PP (6.29 ± 1.54 vs 3.13 ± 2.82, p < 0.001). No conversion to open thoracotomy was recorded in either group. CONCLUSIONS Thoracoscopic esophagectomy in the PP provided less workload and better ergonomic results than the DP.

The prevention of T2D has become imperative to stem the rising rates of this disease. Weight loss is highly effective in preventing T2D; however, the at-risk pool is large, and a clinically meaningful metric for risk stratification to guide interventions remains a challenge. The objective of this study is to predict T2D risk using full-information continuous analysis of nationally sampled data from white and black American adults age ≥45 years. METHODS AND FINDINGS A sample of 12,043 black (33%) and white individuals from a population-based cohort, REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) (enrolled 2003-2007), was observed through 2013-2016. The mean participant age was 63.12 ± 8.62 years, and 43.7% were male. Mean BMI was 28.55 ± 5.61 kg/m2. Risk factors for T2D regularly recorded in the primary care setting were used to evaluate future T2D risk using Bayesian logistic regression. External validation was performed using 9,710 participants (19% black) from Atherosclerotic Risk in Communities (ARIC) (enrolled 1987-1989), observed through 1996-1998. The mean participant age in this cohort was 53.86 ± 5.65 years, and 44.6% were male. Mean BMI was 27.15 ± 4.92 kg/m2. Predictive performance was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) statistics. The primary outcome was incident T2D. By 2016 in REGARDS, there were 1,602 incident cases of T2D. Risk factors used to predict T2D progression included age, sex, race, BMI, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, blood pressure, and blood glucose. The Bayesian logistic model (AUC = 0.79) outperformed the Framingham risk score (AUC = 0.76), the American Diabetes Association risk score (AUC = 0.64), and a cardiometabolic disease system (using Adult Treatment Panel III criteria) (AUC = 0.75). Validation in ARIC was robust (AUC = 0.85). Main limitations include the limited generalizability of the REGARDS sample to black and white, older Americans, and no time to diagnosis for T2D. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that a Bayesian logistic model using full-information continuous predictors has high predictive discrimination, and can be used to quantify race- and sex-specific T2D risk, providing a new, powerful predictive tool. This tool can be used for T2D prevention efforts including weight loss therapy by allowing clinicians to target high-risk individuals in a manner that could be used to optimize outcomes.","Wilkinson, Lua; Yi, Nengjun; Mehta, Tapan; Judd, Suzanne; Garvey, W Timothy",PLoS medicine,155,1

However, none of these trials were powered to assess the safety and efficacy of DES in women because only a small proportion of recruited participants were women. We therefore investigated the safety and efficacy of DES in female patients during long-term follow-up. METHODS We pooled patient-level data for female participants from 26 randomised trials of DES and analysed outcomes according to stent type (bare-metal stents, early-generation DES, and newer-generation DES). The primary safety endpoint was a composite of death or myocardial infarction. The secondary safety endpoint was definite or probable stent thrombosis. The primary efficacy endpoint was target-lesion revascularisation. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS Of 43,904 patients recruited in 26 trials of DES, 11,557 (26·3%) were women (mean age 67·1 years [SD 10·6]). 1108 (9·6%) women received bare-metal stents, 4171 (36·1%) early-generation DES, and 6278 (54·3%) newer-generation DES. At 3 years, estimated cumulative incidence of the composite of death or myocardial infarction occurred in 132 (12·8%) women in the bare-metal stent group, 421 (10·9%) in the early-generation DES group, and 496 (9·2%) in the newer-generation DES group (p=0·001). Definite or probable stent thrombosis occurred in 13 (1·3%), 79 (2·1%), and 66 (1·1%) women in the bare-metal stent, early-generation DES, and newer-generation DES groups, respectively (p=0·01). The use of DES was associated with a significant reduction in the 3 year rates of target-lesion revascularisation (197 [18·6%] women in the bare-metal stent group, 294 [7·8%] in the early-generation DES group, and 330 [6·3%] in the newer-generation DES group, p<0·0001). Results did not change after adjustment for baseline characteristics in the multivariable analysis. INTERPRETATION The use of DES in women is more effective and safe than is use of bare-metal stents during long-term follow-up. Newer-generation DES are associated with an improved safety profile compared with early-generation DES, and should therefore be thought of as the standard of care for percutaneous coronary revascularisation in women.

How the characteristics of the various scholarly experiences contributes to scholarly outcomes or the complexities of how the experiences build skills, warrants further exploration. OBJECTIVE To identify how medical students' scholarly experiences lead to scholarly outcomes under what circumstances. METHOD A realist review was conducted with a search of Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus and ERIC databases using the terms ""medical student"" and ""scholarly experience"" and related synonyms. Studies involving the engagement of medical students in a range of compulsory scholarly experiences including quality improvement projects, literature reviews, and research projects were included. Key data were extracted from studies and realist analysis was used to identify how contexts and mechanisms led to different outcomes. RESULTS From an initial 4590 titles, 28 studies of 22 scholarly experiences were identified. All were primarily focused on research-related scholarly experiences. Organisational research culture that valued research, dedicated time, autonomy and choice of experience were found to be key contexts. Adequately supported and structured experiences where students can see the value of research, and quality supervision that builds student's self-efficacy were identified as mechanisms leading to outcomes. Outcomes included increased research skills and attitudes, scholarly outputs (e.g. publications) and future interest in research or other scholarly endeavours. CONCLUSIONS The design of scholarly experiences for medical students needs to ensure protected time, adequate supervision and autonomy, to achieve scholarly outcomes. Much of the focus is on research and traditional outcomes with little known about the role or outcomes associated with other scholarly work.","Cornett, Marian; Palermo, Claire; Wallace, Megan J; Diug, Basia; Ward, Bernadette",Medical education,155,4

OBJECTIVE To present the perioperative and short-term functional outcomes of RASP in a large series of patients with LUTS due to BPE treated in a high-volume referral center. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We retrospectively collected data for 67 consecutive patients who underwent RASP from October 2008 to August 2014. SURGICAL PROCEDURE RASP was performed using a Da Vinci S or Si system with a transvesical approach. MEASUREMENTS Complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo system. Continuous variables are reported as median and interquartile range (IQR). Comparison of preoperative and postoperative outcomes was assessed by Wilcoxon test. A two-sided value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The median preoperative prostate volume was 129ml (IQR 104-180). For the 45 patients who did not have an indwelling catheter, the median preoperative International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was 25 (20.5-28), the median maximum flow rate (Qmax) was 7ml/s (IQR 5-11), and the median post-void residual volume (PVRV) was 73ml (IQR 40-116). The median operative time was 97min (IQR 80-127) and the median estimated blood loss was 200ml (IQR 115-360). The postoperative complication rate was 30%, including three cases (4.5%) with grade 3b complications (major bleeding requiring cystoscopy and coagulation). The median catheterization time was 3 d (IQR 2-4) and the median length of stay was 4 d (IQR 3-5). The median follow-up was 6 mo (IQR 2-12). At follow-up, the median IPSS was 3 (IQR 0-8), the median Qmax was 23ml/s (IQR 16-35), and the median PVRV was 0ml (IQR 0-36) (all p<0.001 vs baseline values). The retrospective design is the major study limitation. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate good perioperative outcomes, an acceptable risk profile, and excellent improvements in patient symptoms and flow scores at short-term follow-up following RASP. PATIENT SUMMARY We analyzed the perioperative and functional outcomes of robot-assisted simple prostatectomy in the treatment of male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms due to large prostatic adenoma. The procedure was associated with a relatively low risk of complications and excellent functional outcomes, including considerable improvements in symptoms and flow performance. We can conclude that the procedure is a valuable option in the treatment of such patients. However, comparative studies evaluating the efficacy of the procedure in comparison with endoscopic treatment of large prostatic adenomas are needed.","Pokorny, Morgan; Novara, Giacomo; Geurts, Nicolas; Dovey, Zach; De Groote, Ruben; Ploumidis, Achilles; Schatteman, Peter; de Naeyer, Geert; Mottrie, Alexandre",European urology,155,5

Here, we established a protocol to purify these membranous replication complexes (RCs) from cells infected with Semliki Forest virus (SFV). We isolated SFV spherules located on the plasma membrane and further purified them using two consecutive density gradients. This revealed that SFV infection strongly modifies cellular membranes. We removed soluble proteins, the Golgi membranes, and most of the mitochondria, but plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and late endosome markers were retained in the membrane fraction that contained viral RNA synthesizing activity, replicase proteins, and minus- and plus-strand RNA. Electron microscopy revealed that the purified membranes displayed spherule-like structures with a narrow neck. This membrane enrichment was specific to viral replication, as such a distribution of membrane markers was only observed after infection. Besides the plasma membrane, SFV infection remodeled the ER, and the cofractionation of the RC-carrying plasma membrane and ER suggests that SFV recruits ER proteins or membrane to the site of replication. The purified RCs were highly active in synthesizing both genomic and subgenomic RNA. Detergent solubilization destroyed the replication activity, demonstrating that the membrane association of the complex is essential. Most of the newly made RNA was in double-stranded replicative molecules, but the purified complexes also produced single-stranded RNA as well as released newly made RNA. This indicates that the purification established here maintained the functionality of RCs and thus enables further structural and functional studies of active RCs.IMPORTANCE Similar to all positive-strand RNA viruses, the arthropod-borne alphaviruses induce membranous genome factories, but little is known about the arrangement of viral replicase proteins and the presence of host proteins in these replication complexes. To improve our knowledge of alphavirus RNA-synthesizing complexes, we isolated and purified them from infected mammalian cells. Detection of viral RNA and in vitro replication assays revealed that these complexes are abundant and highly active when located on the plasma membrane. After multiple purification steps, they remain functional in synthesizing and releasing viral RNA. Besides the plasma membrane, markers for the endoplasmic reticulum and late endosomes were enriched with the replication complexes, demonstrating that alphavirus infection modified cellular membranes beyond inducing replication spherules on the plasma membrane. We have developed here a gentle purification method to obtain large quantities of highly active replication complexes, and similar methods can be applied to other positive-strand RNA viruses.","Pietilä, Maija K; van Hemert, Martijn J; Ahola, Tero",Journal of virology,155,1

BACKGROUND Homebound persons have a significantly higher mortality risk as well as physical and psychosocial burden. A clarification of the term is necessary to develop preventive measures. DESIGN Concept analysis. DATA SOURCES Scientific literature from electronic databases (CINAHL, Medline via PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, and Scopus) and definitions from online dictionaries. REVIEW METHODS Walker and Avant's method was applied to guide the concept analysis. To prevent arbitrary and empty results in determining the attributes, antecedents, and consequences a thematic analysis was carried out. RESULTS Homebound is defined as an enduring condition in which the life-space is reduced to the home, but moving around in the home is possible (by walking short distances alone or by holding on to furniture, or with the help of a stick, walker, or another person). Homebound has six attributes: in need of help in ADL/IADL and in leaving the life-space, powerlessness, life-space confinement, mobility limitation, endurance, and weakness. Physiological instability and physical immobility are antecedents with wide-ranging influencing factors as illness, complexity, burden, and endogenous/exogenous booster. Homebound has also wide-ranging consequences such as the progression of inactivity, physical, psychosocial, and/or spiritual problems. CONCLUSIONS The multidimensional concept of homebound modifies the concepts of mobility and immobility. Given the extensive consequences of homebound nurses play a central role in the prevention.","Schirghuber, Johannes; Schrems, Berta",Nursing forum,155,1

Genetically linked connective tissue diseases lead to degeneration, aneurysm formation and spontaneous dissection or rupture of arteries. The most well-known are Marfan syndrome, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type IV), Loeys-Dietz syndrome and familial aortic aneurysms and dissections. OBJECTIVE This review article addresses the current status of endovascular treatment options for important connective tissue diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS Evaluation of currently available randomized studies and registry data. RESULTS The treatment of choice for patients that are mostly affected at a young age is primarily conservative or open repair. There is only limited evidence for endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) of abdominal aneurysms or thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). CONCLUSION The progression of the disease with dilatation leads to secondary endoleaks and high reintervention rates with uncertain long-term results. For this reason, there is currently consensus that EVAR and TEVAR should be limited to justified exceptional cases and emergency situations in patients with genetically linked aortic diseases.","Böckler, D; Meisenbacher, K; Peters, A S; Grond-Ginsbach, C; Bischoff, M S",Gefasschirurgie : Zeitschrift fur vaskulare und endovaskulare Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschen und der Osterreichischen Gesellschaft fur Gefasschirurgie unter Mitarbeit der Schweizerischen Gesellschaft fur Gefasschirurgie,155,1

The purpose of this study is to describe the use of end tidal oxygen (eto2) during rapid sequence intubation in the emergency department. METHODS This study was carried out in 2 academic centers in Sydney, Australia, and New York City. We included patients undergoing rapid sequence intubation in the emergency department. A standard gas analyzer was used to measure eto2. Preoxygenation methods included nonrebreather mask and bag-valve-mask ventilation. We measured eto2 before preoxygenation and at administration of rapid sequence intubation medications. We also characterized peri-intubation SpO2, identifying instances of SpO2 less than 90%. RESULTS We included 100 patients during a 6-month period. Median eto2 level before and after preoxygenation was 53% (interquartile range [IQR] 43% to 65%) and 78% (IQR 64% to 86%), respectively. One fourth of patients achieved an eto2 level greater than 85%. Median eto2 level achieved varied with preoxygenation method, ranging from 80% (IQR 60% to 87%) for the nonrebreather mask group to 77% (IQR 65% to 86%) for the bag-valve-mask group. The method with the highest median eto2 level was nonrebreather mask at flush rate (86%; IQR 80% to 90%) and the lowest median eto2 level was nonrebreather mask at 15 L/min (57%; IQR 53% to 60%). Eighteen patients (18%) experienced oxygen desaturation (SpO2 <90%); of these, 14 (78%) did not reach an eto2 level greater than 85% at induction. CONCLUSION ETO2 varied with different preoxygenation techniques employed in the emergency department. Most patients undergoing rapid sequence intubation did not achieve maximal preoxygenation. Measuring ETO2 in the emergency department may be a valuable adjunct for optimizing preoxygenation during emergency airway management.","Caputo, Nicholas D; Oliver, Matthew; West, Jason R; Hackett, Robert; Sakles, John C",Annals of emergency medicine,155,1

Whilst prophylactic mesh has been demonstrated to decrease IH rates in clean laparotomy wounds, mesh has been associated with high rates of seroma formation (>30%), infection (>10%) and pain, discouraging many surgeons from using mesh, especially combined with intestinal surgery. The aim of this study is to review the experience of a single colorectal surgeon who, after noting high IH rates in his own patients, started placing prophylactic mesh routinely in patients judged to be at high risk of IH. METHODS The records of all patients undergoing bowel resections and ileostomy closure by one surgeon from 2008 to 2018 were independently retrospectively analysed. RESULTS Of the 935 procedures identified, 662 patients underwent midline laparotomy with bowel resection and 273 patients underwent closure of loop ileostomy. Mesh was placed prophylactically in 221 (23.6%) of 935 procedures. Comparing the mesh and non-mesh groups, wound infections occurred in nine (4.1%) versus 23 (3.2%) (P = 0.53), seromas occurred in nine (4.1%) versus six (0.8%) (P = 0.003) and chronic pain was noted in 12 (5.4%) versus 17 (2.4%) (P = 0.04). The mean follow-up was 33 months in both the mesh and non-mesh groups. IHs have occurred in three (1.3%) of the mesh group compared to 95 (13.3%) of the non-mesh group procedures (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION In colorectal operations, prophylactic mesh decreases the risk of IH without prohibitive complications.","Wong, Jean; Jones, Julia; Ananthapadmanabhan, Saikrishna; Meagher, Alan P",ANZ journal of surgery,155,1

In this study, we performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to determine the inhibitory effects of Lactobacillus plantarum metabolites (LPM) on PEDV replication. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed exopolysaccharides to be one of the main components of LPM. We then determine whether L. plantarum exopolysaccharides (LPE) have an antiviral effect and also detected the expression levels of the apoptosis-related genes Bax and Bcl-2 and of the pro-apoptotic protein caspase-3. Further, we assessed the transcription levels of an immune-related protein (STAT1) and antiviral factors (MX1, MX2, ISG15, ZAP, PKR, and OAS1). Our results showed that the most effective method was to pretreat cells with LPM and that the optimal dose of LPM that could be safely administered to Vero cells was 1/8 times of the stock solution. LPE had a strong inhibitory effect on PEDV; the most effective method of administration was to co-incubate cells with LPE and PEDV, and the optimal concentration of LPE was 1.35 mg/mL. To conclude, LPE prevented PEDV adsorption and also alleviated inflammatory responses and induced early apoptosis of injured cells, but it could not regulate the immune function of cells.","Huang, Shilei; Yu, Qiuhan; Xie, Luyi; Ran, Ling; Wang, Kai; Yang, Yang; Gan, Lu; Song, Zhenhui",Research in veterinary science,155,1

We investigated the use of retrograde tube gastrostomy (RG) after esophagectomy. METHODS Patients underwent either NG or RG placement for postoperative conduit decompression. Both tubes were maintained on low continuous suction. RESULTS Between 2000 and 2008, 306 patients underwent esophagectomy with reconstruction. One hundred ninety-three patients underwent NG and 113 underwent RG placement. The 2 groups were comparable in age, gender, tumor stage, and smoking status. Patients in the NG group were more likely to have received neoadjuvant therapy and to have a thoracotomy for esophagectomy. The incidence of respiratory complications was lower in the retrograde group compared with the NG group: Pneumonia, 9 of 113(8.0%) vs 50 of 193 (25.9%), p<0.001; respiratory failure requiring bronchoscopy or reintubation, 12 of 113 (10.8%) vs 46 of 193 (23.8%), p=0.004; aspiration, 4 of 113 (3.5%) vs 20 of 193 (10.4%), p=0.045. The incidence of cardiac dysrhythmias was also lower in the retrograde group (18 of 113 [15.9%] vs 69 of 193 [35.8%], p<0.001). The incidence of wound complications, myocardial infarction, stroke, and conduit necrosis-anastomotic leak was similar between groups. In a multivariate regression model an NG tube was the strongest predictor for postoperative pneumonia (odds ratio 3.27, 95% confidence interval 1.50 to 7.12). The other predictors were prior chest surgery, smoking, and thoracotomy incision. There were 4 minor complications related to the retrograde tube (wound infection n=1, broken tube requiring endoscopy n=2, tube caught in anastomosis detected intraoperatively n=1). CONCLUSIONS Retrograde gastrostomy decompression of the conduit after esophagectomy is effective and diminishes complications compared with NG tube drainage.","Puri, Varun; Hu, Yinin; Guthrie, Tracey; Crabtree, Traves D; Kreisel, Daniel; Krupnick, Alexander S; Patterson, G Alexander; Meyers, Bryan F",The Annals of thoracic surgery,155,31

Hitherto, there has been no approved drug or vaccine for this disease. Therefore, the use of general antiviral drugs is at the first line of treatment, though complicated with limited effectiveness and systemic side effects. Given the pathophysiology of the disease, researchers have proposed various strategies not only to find a more specific therapeutic way but also to reduce the side effects. One strategy to accomplish these goals is to use CRISPR/Cas13 system. Recently, a group of scientists have used the CRISPR/Cas13 system, which is highly effective to eliminate the genome of RNA viruses. Due to the RNA nature of the coronavirus genome, it seems that this system can be effective against the disease. The main challenge regarding the application of this system is to deliver it to the target cells efficiently. To solve this challenge, it seems that using virosomes with protein S on their membrane surface can be helpful. Studies have shown that protein S interacts with its specific receptor in target cells named as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here, we propose if CRISPR/Cas13 gene constructs reach the infected cells efficiently using a virosomal delivery system, the virus genome will be cleaved and inactivated. Considering the pathophysiology of the disease, an important step to implement this hypothesis is to embed protein S on the membrane surface of virosomes to facilitate the delivery of gene constructs to the target cells.","Goudarzi, Kazem Abaszadeh; Nematollahi, Mohammad Hadi; Khanbabaei, Hashem; Nave, Hossein Hosseini; Mirzaei, Hamid Reza; Pourghadamyari, Hossein; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,155,1

The mean loneliness scores were significantly higher than previous studies in other contexts as well as studies conducted in the time of COVID-19. Correlational analysis found that greater perceived risk of infection, limited perceived knowledge of COVID-19 and lower appraisals of resilience were associated with increased loneliness. In a regression analysis, when all COVID-19 variables were considered simultaneously, only resilience, self-rated knowledge, and risk perception emerged as significant correlates of loneliness. These findings suggest that loneliness is a significant public health concern in South Africa in the time of COVID-19.

Our aim was to analyze whether baseline e-ASPECT scores correlate with outcome after mechanical thrombectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with ischemic strokes in the anterior circulation who were admitted between 2010 and 2015, diagnosed by CT, and received mechanical thrombectomy were included. The ASPECTS on baseline CT was scored by e-ASPECTS and 3 expert raters, and interclass correlation coefficients were calculated. The e-ASPECTS was correlated with functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale) at 3 months by using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Unfavorable outcome was defined as mRS 4-6 at 3 months, and a poor scan was defined as e-ASPECTS 0-5. RESULTS Two hundred twenty patients were included, and 147 (67%) were treated with bridging protocols. The median e-ASPECTS was 9 (interquartile range, 8-10). Intraclass correlation coefficients between e-ASPECTS and raters were 0.72, 0.74, and 0.76 (all, P < .001). e-ASPECTS (Spearman rank correlation coefficient = -0.15, P = .027) correlated with mRS at 3 months.

Independent predictors of unfavorable outcome were e-ASPECTS (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63-0.99), blood sugar (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.004-1.02), atrial fibrillation (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.22-5.69), premorbid mRS (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.21-2.58), NIHSS (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.19), general anesthesia (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.07-0.84), failed recanalization (OR, 8.47; 95% CI, 3.5-20.2), and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (OR, 25.8; 95% CI, 2.5-268). CONCLUSIONS The e-ASPECTS correlated with mRS at 3 months and was predictive of unfavorable outcome after mechanical thrombectomy, but further studies in patients with poor scan are needed.","Pfaff, J; Herweh, C; Schieber, S; Schönenberger, S; Bösel, J; Ringleb, P A; Möhlenbruch, M; Bendszus, M; Nagel, S",AJNR.

Likewise, after a slight increase of deaths in April (14,804) compared to March (12,396), a considerable decline occurred in May (5,170) and June (1,464). Doubling times of cumulative cases grew from 2-6 days until March 20 to 2 weeks up to April 5, and thereafter no further doubling occurred until June 30. There was a striking North-South gradient of both cases and deaths. At the end of June, the 9 northern Italian regions or provinces, 5 central regions and 7 southern regions had contributed to the 81.1%, 12.4% and 6.5% of the 240,578 national cases, respectively. Lombardy, the most populous region, was by far the most heavily affected one, accounting for the 39.0% of the national cases occurring over the analyzed 4-month period. However, in relative terms, it was preceded by Aosta Valley, the least populous region, less than 1% of the population of both regions having been affected by cases of COVID-19. The curves showing the ratio of daily cumulative cases and deaths to those of the previous day tended to flatten with time by approaching the zero growth but without reaching it, which documents some persisting circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the Italian territory.

Although postnatally acquired CMV (pCMV) infection rarely results in serious manifestations in term infants, preterm infants can develop severe clinical illness. However, the long-term implications of pCMV infection of preterm infants are unknown. Few robust studies on long-term outcomes of pCMV infection have been performed, and those reported often present conflicting results. Our objective was to assess the long-term outcomes for low birthweight (LBW) preterm infants after pCMV infection. METHODS A systematic review of English and non-English articles using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and Web of Science was conducted. Search strategies included a mix of keywords and database-specific subject headings for CMV and LBW infants. Editorials, comments, reviews and animal-only studies were excluded. Case reports, observational, experimental and randomized controlled trials that examined pCMV in preterm or VLBW infants and long-term (>1 month) impact of pCMV were included. RESULTS pCMV infection in preterm infants is associated with increased risk for pulmonary and neurologic complications and increases length of stay. There is less evidence to suggest that pCMV is associated with necrotizing enterocolitis, ophthalmologic, audiologic and anthropomorphic complications in preterm infants. CONCLUSIONS Preterm infants with pCMV, especially those with symptomatic infection, may have long-term pulmonary and neurodevelopmental morbidity compared with their pCMV negative counterparts. Our results highlight the importance of pCMV detection and prevention in preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. Large prospective studies are needed to fully define outcomes and determine if treatment improves outcomes.","Stark, Ashley; Cantrell, Sarah; Greenberg, Rachel G; Permar, Sallie R; Weimer, Kristin E D",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,155,1
78967,78967,78967,A call for diagnostic tests to report viral load.,13.342047,6.7350926,2020-10-02,"Coronaviruses encode two classes of cysteine proteases, which have narrow substrate specificities and either a chymotrypsin- or papain-like fold. These enzymes mediate the processing of the two precursor polyproteins of the viral replicase and are also thought to modulate host cell functions to facilitate infection. The papain-like protease 1 (PL1(pro)) domain is present in nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) of alphacoronaviruses and subgroup 2a betacoronaviruses. It participates in the proteolytic processing of the N-terminal region of the replicase polyproteins in a manner that varies among different coronaviruses and remains poorly understood. Here we report the first structural and biochemical characterization of a purified coronavirus PL1(pro) domain, that of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Its tertiary structure is compared with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus PL2(pro), a downstream paralog that is conserved in the nsp3's of all coronaviruses. We identify both conserved and unique structural features likely controlling the interaction of PL1(pro) with cofactors and substrates, including the tentative mapping of substrate pocket residues. The purified recombinant TGEV PL1(pro) was shown to cleave a peptide mimicking the cognate nsp2|nsp3 cleavage site. Like its PL2(pro) paralogs from several coronaviruses, TGEV PL1(pro) was also found to have deubiquitinating activity in an in vitro cleavage assay, implicating it in counteracting ubiquitin-regulated host cell pathways, likely including innate immune responses. In combination with the prior characterization of PL2(pro) from other alphacoronaviruses, e.g., human coronaviruses 229E and NL63, our results unequivocally establish that these viruses employ two PL(pro)s with overlapping specificities toward both viral and cellular substrates.","Wojdyla, Justyna A; Manolaridis, Ioannis; van Kasteren, Puck B; Kikkert, Marjolein; Snijder, Eric J; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Tucker, Paul A",Journal of virology,155,17

To examine shelter characteristics and infection prevention practices in relation to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection point prevalence during universal testing at homeless shelters in the United States.Methods. SARS-CoV-2 testing was offered to clients and staff at homeless shelters, irrespective of symptoms. Site assessments were conducted from March 30 to June 1, 2020, to collect information on shelter characteristics and infection prevention practices. We assessed the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence and shelter characteristics, including 20 infection prevention practices by using crude risk ratios (RRs) and exact unconditional 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results. Site assessments and SARS-CoV-2 testing results were reported for 63 homeless shelters in 7 US urban areas. Median infection prevalence was 2.9% (range = 0%-71.4%). Shelters implementing head-to-toe sleeping and excluding symptomatic staff from working were less likely to have high infection prevalence (RR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.3, 0.8; and RR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.4, 0.6; respectively); shelters with medical services available were less likely to have very high infection prevalence (RR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.2, 1.0).Conclusions. Sleeping arrangements and staffing policies are modifiable factors that might be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence in homeless shelters. Shelters should follow recommended practices to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. (Am J Public Health.

INTRODUCTION Implementation science is an expanding field of study that investigates the integration of evidence-based practices into real world settings. Qualitative methods are useful for providing an in-depth understanding of implementation strategies and outcomes from the perspectives of stakeholders such as policy makers, health practitioners, and individuals targeted by health interventions. Qualitative research methods are increasingly used in implementation research. A synthesis of the applications of qualitative methods is lacking, although it is critical for understanding how qualitative methods have been used to date and identifying areas for improvement. INCLUSION CRITERIA The review will include implementation research studies that collect primary data using one or more qualitative methods, alone or with quantitative methods. Studies must assess implementation research issues in health but will not be restricted by the type of setting, health issue, or country of origin. METHODS The search for relevant studies will be restricted to articles published in English from 2006 to the present that are found in 46 prominent medical and public health journals that publish research in implementation science. Multiple reviewers will screen articles to identify those that meet the inclusion criteria. Data extraction will involve a structured and systematic method with categories for descriptive characteristics of studies, health topics, qualitative methods for data collection and analysis, implementation science outcomes and issues explored, and implementation science frameworks applied.","Hagaman, Ashley; Rhodes, Elizabeth C; Nyhan, Kate; Katague, Marina; Schwartz, Anna; Spiegelman, Donna",JBI evidence synthesis,155,1

This article will review the changing epidemiology of these viruses after hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS Respiratory viruses are frequently detected in transplant recipients. A number of viruses have been newly discovered or emerged in the last decade, including human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, new human coronaviruses and rhinoviruses, human polyomaviruses, and a new 2009 pandemic strain of influenza A/H1N1. The potential for these viruses to cause lower respiratory tract infections after transplantation varies, and is greatest for human metapneumovirus and H1N1 influenza, but appears to be limited for the other new viruses. Acute and long-term complications in hematopoietic and solid organ transplant recipients are active areas of research. SUMMARY Respiratory viral infections are frequently associated with significant morbidity following transplantation and are therefore of great clinical and epidemiologic interest. As new viruses are discovered, and more sensitive diagnostic methods are developed, defining the full impact of emerging respiratory viruses in transplant recipients must be elucidated by well designed clinical studies.","Renaud, Christian; Campbell, Angela P",Current opinion in infectious diseases,155,26

This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data. All women who underwent prolapse and/or urinary incontinence surgery between January and June 2010 were included. Validated ICIQ questionnaires for prolapse and/or incontinence, as appropriate, were used, before surgery and at 6 months postoperatively. The primary outcome was the response rate to postal follow-up. A total of 70 women had urogynaecology surgery during the study period; 65 (93%) women returned the questionnaires (95% CI 84-97%, p < 0.0001). The postoperative questionnaires scores showed a statistically significant improvement compared with the preoperative scores. This results in only a small proportion of women needing hospital attendance for follow-up (10%).

The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is responsible for the current worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 that has resulted in 2,112,844 deaths as of late January, 2021. We compared genetic code preferences in 496 viruses, including 34 coronaviruses, and 242 corresponding hosts, to uncover patterns that distinguish single and ""promiscuous"" multiple host-infecting viruses. Based on a codon usage preference score, promiscuous viruses were shown to significantly employ non-optimal codons, namely, codons that involve ""wobble"" binding to anti-codons, as compared to single host viruses. The codon adaptation index (CAI) and the effective number of codons (ENC) were calculated for all viruses and hosts. Promiscuous viruses were less adapted hosts versus single host viruses (p-value=4.392e-11). All coronaviruses exploit non-optimal codons to infect multiple hosts. We found that non-optimal codon preferences at the beginning of viral coding sequences enhance the translational efficiency of viral proteins within the host. Finally, coronaviruses lack endogenous RNA degradation motifs to a significant degree, thereby increasing viral mRNA burden and infection load. To conclude, we found that promiscuously infecting coronaviruses prefer non-optimal codon usage to remove degradation motifs from their RNAs and to dramatically increase their viral RNA production rates.","Carmi, Gon; Gorohovski, Alessandro; Mukherjee, Sumit; Frenkel-Morgenstern, Milana",The FEBS journal,155,33

These data are of particular importance in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused disruptions in healthcare processes and may continue to impact cancer care for the foreseeable future. The aim of our study was to characterize the prevalence and clinical significance of diagnostic and treatment delays in patients with HCC. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients diagnosed with HCC between January 2008 and July 2017 at 2 US health systems. Diagnostic and treatment delays were defined as >90 days between presentation and HCC diagnosis and between diagnosis and treatment, respectively. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with diagnostic and treatment delays and Cox proportional hazard models to identify correlates of overall survival. RESULTS Of 925 patients with HCC, 39.0% were diagnosed via screening, 33.1% incidentally, and 27.9% symptomatically. Median time from presentation to diagnosis was 37 days (interquartile range, 18-94 days), with 120 patients (13.0%) experiencing diagnostic delays. Median time from HCC diagnosis to treatment was 46 days (interquartile range, 29-74 days), with 17.2% of patients experiencing treatment delays. Most (72.5%) diagnostic delays were related to provider-level factors (eg, monitoring indeterminate nodules), whereas nearly half (46.2%) of treatment delays were related to patient-related factors (eg, missed appointments). In multivariable analyses, treatment delays were not associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.60-1.35); these results were consistent across subgroup analyses by Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage and treatment modality. CONCLUSIONS Diagnostic and therapeutic delays exceeding 3 months are common in patients with HCC; however, observed treatment delays do not seem to significantly impact overall survival.","Rao, Ashwin; Rich, Nicole E; Marrero, Jorge A; Yopp, Adam C; Singal, Amit G",Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,155,1

METHODS The cross-sectional study examined the eyes of 44 subjects, graded from the first to third keratoconus stages by Amsler-Krumeich classification. We obtained measurements in two ways: (a) by projecting two perpendicular axes onto a cornea (first, through the central point of the cornea and keratoconus apex; second, as the perpendicular axis) to read the elevation values at points on these axes as parameters characterising the corneal surface; (b) by projecting circles with different diameters around the central part of the cornea (1, 2, and 3 mm) and reading elevation values at points equally displaced on these circles as parameters characterising an anterior surface slope. Irregular corneal shape parameters' correlations with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were determined in order to understand which corneal slope parameter has the strongest correlation with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. RESULTS Parameters characterising the corneal surface's correlations with contrast sensitivity were from r = 0.25 (p = 0.03) at 3 cpd to r = 0.47 (p < 0.01) at 9 cpd for the highest elevation and from r = 0.33 (p = 0.09) at 5 cpd to r = 0.40 (p < 0.01) at 11 cpd for the lowest elevation in all subjects together, while for visual acuity the parameters were r = 0.30 (p < 0.01) for the highest elevation and r = 0.21 (p = 0.06) for the lowest elevation in all subjects together. The correlation between contrast sensitivity and the highest and lowest corneal point in all measured cornea was stronger for subjects with a peripheral corneal apex than for those with a central apex. In keratoconus subjects, contrast sensitivity displayed a strong correlation with slope in the central part of the cornea (with a radius of 1 mm) ranging from 0.48 (p < 0.01) at 3 cpd to 0.61 (p < 0.01) at 9 cpd. CONCLUSION Contrast sensitivity has a higher correlation with corneal shape parameters than with visual acuity. Subjects with a peripheral corneal apex had stronger correlations with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity than did subjects with a central apex. In keratoconus subjects, the strongest correlation was for contrast sensitivity and elevation (slope) in the region within a 1 mm radius of the corneal centre in the opposite direction of the keratoconus apex (direction (ax) CB).","Liduma, Sanita; Luguzis, Artis; Krumina, Gunta",BMC ophthalmology,155,1

Surgical delays and access to three Bellwether procedures are key monitoring indicators for universal access to safe and affordable surgical and anesthesia care and health system performance. This study assessed the delays in receiving surgical and anesthesia care for emergency surgical patients at a district hospital in Northern Rwanda. METHODS A questionnaire was used to survey all emergency surgical patients who presented at the hospital between May and July 2020, to assess the delays in seeking (first) and reaching (second) care. In-hospital (third) delay and patient outcomes within the first 7 days postsurgery were collected by patient file auditing. Factors associated with third delay were identified through healthcare provider in-depth interviews. RESULTS A total of 106 patients were surveyed, and nine healthcare providers were interviewed. The median was less than a day for first delay, 1 day for second delay, and 16.5 h for third delay for all emergency procedures. 20% of the Bellwether procedures were performed within two hours after arriving at the hospital. Factors affecting the delays included visiting a traditional healer, district of residence, referral system, income status, as well as shortage of surgeons and specialists, surgical supplies, and operating theaters. CONCLUSION Further research to study the cause of delays within the referral system is needed. Surgical outreach, equipment, and infrastructure would help to shorten in-hospital delays. Longer-term follow-up studies on patient complications and outcomes due to delay in surgical care are needed.","Agasaro, Orietta; Munezero, Georgette; Wong, Rex; Hirwa, Aimé; Bekele, Abebe",World journal of surgery,155,12

We describe an effective alternative to standard endotracheal intubation using a Rüsch flexible intubation guide catheter. METHODS In two patients undergoing tracheal repair surgery, we failed to insert a 5.0 inner diameter endotracheal tube (6.9 mm outer diameter) or a 6.0 mm outer diameter endoscope through the laryngotracheal stenosis. However, using indirect laryngoscopy, a 6.0 outer diameter Rüsch flexible intubation guide catheter was passed successfully through the vocal cords and then through the stenosis. Controlled ventilation was achieved by means of the Rüsch guide, provided with its two large Murphy's eyes. When the trachea was opened, the Rüsch guide was removed just enough for the surgeons to place a Montandon tracheal tube, at that point taking over ventilation. A 7.0 inner diameter endotracheal cuffed tube had been inserted onto the Rüsch guide and left pending upstream from the vocal cords. Once the posterior tracheal wall was sutured, this endotracheal cuffed tube was slid along the Rüsch guide through the vocal cords with the cuff placed beyond the tracheal sutures. RESULTS Controlled ventilation through the Rüsch flexible intubation guide catheter showed satisfying and stable ventilatory parameters in both patients. Inspiratory pressures of 25-30 mmHg were enough to reach adequate tidal volumes around 450 ml. End tidal CO2 was kept between 35 and 40 mmHg (PaCO2 showed similar values). Standard endotracheal intubation at the end of the tracheal resection was easy and safe thanks to the Rüsch guide still in place between the vocal cords. CONCLUSIONS We suggest an effective and reliable method using a Rüsch flexible intubation guide catheter for airway management in patients suffering from laryngotracheal stenosis in the setting of tracheal repair surgery.","Van Regemorter, Victoria; Potié, Arnaud; Schmitz, Sandra; Scholtes, Jean-Louis; Veevaete, Laurent; Van Boven, Michel",Journal of otolaryngology - head & neck surgery = Le Journal d'oto-rhino-laryngologie et de chirurgie cervico-faciale,155,1

Globally, MERS-CoV has been responsible for 877 laboratory-confirmed infections, including 317 deaths, since September 2012. As there is a paucity of information regarding the molecular pathogenesis associated with this virus or the identities of novel antiviral drug targets, we performed temporal kinome analysis on human hepatocytes infected with the Erasmus isolate of MERS-CoV with peptide kinome arrays. bioinformatics analysis of our kinome data, including pathway overrepresentation analysis (ORA) and functional network analysis, suggested that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine-threonine kinase (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling responses were specifically modulated in response to MERS-CoV infection in vitro throughout the course of infection. The overrepresentation of specific intermediates within these pathways determined by pathway and functional network analysis of our kinome data correlated with similar patterns of phosphorylation determined through Western blot array analysis. In addition, analysis of the effects of specific kinase inhibitors on MERS-CoV infection in tissue culture models confirmed these cellular response observations. Further, we have demonstrated that a subset of licensed kinase inhibitors targeting the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways significantly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in vitro whether they were added before or after viral infection. Taken together, our data suggest that ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling responses play important roles in MERS-CoV infection and may represent novel drug targets for therapeutic intervention strategies.","Kindrachuk, Jason; Ork, Britini; Hart, Brit J; Mazur, Steven; Holbrook, Michael R; Frieman, Matthew B; Traynor, Dawn; Johnson, Reed F; Dyall, Julie; Kuhn, Jens H; Olinger, Gene G; Hensley, Lisa E; Jahrling, Peter B",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,155,16

However, caregivers' attitudes and perspectives on this are unknown. Objective: To evaluate children's caregivers' acceptability of pharmacists intervening in their antibiotic prescriptions for URTIs with respect to their knowledge of and attitude toward pharmacists and knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors related to antibiotics. Methods: A 69-item survey was created and sent to a panel of caregivers. ANCOVA and path analysis were used to evaluate the relationship between caregiver characteristics and their acceptability of pharmacists intervening in children's antibiotic prescriptions for URTIs. Results: Responses from 246 caregivers who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were analyzed. Mean caregivers' acceptability of pharmacists intervening in children's antibiotic prescriptions for URTIs was 3.25 out of 5 (±1.01). The ANCOVA model (adjusted R2 = .636) showed positive attitude toward pharmacists and being more accepting of health advice from pharmacists since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with higher caregiver acceptability of pharmacists intervening in children's antibiotic prescriptions. Caregivers with better relationships with their pharmacist also tend to have better attitudes toward pharmacists. Not wanting antibiotics for symptom relief was associated with decreased acceptability scores. Conclusion: Overall caregiver acceptability of pharmacists intervening in antibiotic prescriptions was slightly above neutral. Building a relationship with caregivers could help change their attitude and increase the acceptability of pharmacists intervening in children's antibiotic prescriptions. Caregivers seeking symptomatic relief may be more open to non-antibiotic alternatives.","Toth, Jennifer M; Rosenthal, Meagen; Sharma, Manvi; Barnard, Marie",Journal of pharmacy practice,155,29

Here we investigated the behavioral and physiological responses of individuals remaining after conspecifics were removed. We conducted a series of 4 experiments incorporating a range of types of different dairy cattle groupings [experiment 1 (E1), 126 outdoor lactating dairy cows; experiment 2 (E2), 120 housed lactating dairy cows; experiment 3 (E3), 18 housed dairy calves; and experiment 4 (E4), 22 housed dairy bulls] from which a subset of individuals were permanently removed (E1, n=7; E2, n=5; E3, n=9; E4, n=18). Associations between individuals were established using near-neighbor scores (based upon identities and distances between animals recorded before removal) in E1, E2, and E3. Behavioral recordings were taken for 3 to 5 d, before and after removal on a sample of cattle in all 4 experiments (E1, n=20; E2, n=20; E3, n=9; E4, n=4). In 2 experiments with relatively large groups of dairy cows, E1 and E2, the responses of cows that did and did not associate with the removed cows were compared. An increase in time that both nonassociates and associates spent eating was observed after conspecific removal in E1. In E2, this increase was restricted to cows that had not associated with the removed cows. A reduction in ruminating in remaining cattle was observed in E3 and eating in E4. Immunoglobulin A concentrations increased after separation in both E3 and E4 cattle, but did not differ significantly between associates and nonassociates in E2. Blood and milk cortisol concentrations were not affected by conspecific removal. These findings suggest that some animals had affected feeding behavior and IgA concentrations after removal of conspecifics.","Walker, Jessica K; Arney, David R; Waran, Natalie K; Handel, Ian G; Phillips, Clive J C",Journal of dairy science,155,31

DESIGN Controlled challenge study. ANIMALS 66 Holstein bull calves, 3 to 8 days old. PROCEDURES In experiment 1, BRSV-seropositive and -seronegative calves were vaccinated IN with a commercially available combination modified-live virus vaccine formulated for SC administration; calves underwent BRSV challenge 4.5 months later. In experiment 2, BRSV-seronegative calves were vaccinated IN or SC (to examine the effect of route of administration) with the same combination vaccine that instead had a 1/100 dose of BRSV (to examine the effect of dose); calves underwent BRSV challenge 21 days later. RESULTS In experiment 1, BRSV challenge resulted in severe respiratory tract disease with low arterial partial pressures of oxygen and lung lesions in most calves from all groups. Maximum change in rectal temperature was significantly greater in seropositive IN vaccinated calves, compared with seronegative IN vaccinated and seropositive control calves. Number of days of BRSV shedding was significantly lower in seronegative IN vaccinated calves than in seropositive IN vaccinated and seropositive control calves. In experiment 2, maximum change in rectal temperature was significantly greater in seronegative control calves, compared with seronegative IN and SC vaccinated calves. Shedding of BRSV was significantly reduced in seronegative IN and SC vaccinated calves, compared with control calves; also, lung lesions were reduced in seronegative IN and SC vaccinated calves.

Laminarin depolymerization catalyzed by microbial extracellular enzymes initiates remineralization, a key process in ocean biogeochemical cycles. Here, we described a glycoside hydrolase 16 (GH16) family laminarinase from a marine algae-associated flavobacterium at the biochemical and structural levels. We found that the endolytic enzyme cleaved laminarin with a preference for β-1,3-glycoside linkages and showed transglycosylation activity across a broad range of acceptors. We also solved and compared high-resolution crystal structures of laminarinase in the apo form and in complex with β-1,3-tetrasaccharides, revealing an expanded catalytic cleft formed following substrate binding. Moreover, structure and mutagenesis studies identified multiple specific contacts between the enzyme and glucosyl residues essential for the substrate specificity for β-1,3-glucan. These results provide novel insights into the structural requirements for substrate binding and catalysis of GH16 family laminarinase, enriching our understanding of bacterial utilization of algal laminarin.IMPORTANCE Heterotrophic bacterial communities are key players in marine biogeochemical cycling due to their ability to remineralize organic carbon. Processing of complex organic matter requires heterotrophic bacteria to produce extracellular enzymes with precise specificity to depolymerize substrates to sizes sufficiently small for uptake. Thus, extracellular enzymatic hydrolysis initiates microbe-driven heterotrophic carbon cycling. In this study, based on biochemical and structural analyses, we revealed the depolymerization mechanism of β-1, 3-glucan, a carbon reserve in algae, by laminarinase from an alga-associated marine flavobacterium. The findings provide new insights into the substrate recognition and catalysis of bacterial laminarinase and promote a better understanding of how extracellular enzymes are involved in organic matter cycling.","Yang, Jian; Xu, Yuqun; Miyakawa, Takuya; Long, Lijuan; Tanokura, Masaru",Applied and environmental microbiology,155,19

Two evolutionary trends that contribute to the mechanical complexity of the avian foot are the variation in the relative lengths of the phalanges and the subdivision and variation of the digital flexor musculature observed among taxa. We modelled the grasping behaviour of a simplified bird foot in response to the downward and upward forces imparted by carrying and perching tasks, respectively. Specifically, we compared the performance of various foot geometries performing these tasks when actuated by distally inserted flexors only, versus by both distally inserted and proximally inserted flexors. Our analysis demonstrates that most species possess relative phalanx lengths that are conducive to grasps actuated only by a single distally inserted tendon per digit. Furthermore, proximally inserted flexors are often required during perching, but the distally inserted flexors are sufficient when grasping and carrying objects. These results are reflected in differences in the relative development of proximally and distally inserted digital flexor musculature among 'perching' and 'grasping' taxa. Thus, our results shed light on the relative roles of variation in phalanx length and digit flexor muscle distribution in an integrative, mechanical context.","Backus, Spencer B; Sustaita, Diego; Odhner, Lael U; Dollar, Aaron M",Royal Society open science,155,8

In this work, we have evaluated the effectiveness of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), a surfactant, as a tableting lubricant. If adequate lubrication efficiency is achieved, the use of SLS may be suitable to mitigate problems associated with hydrophobic lubricants. Results show that SLS, when applied in the proper amount to typical pharmaceutical powder mixtures, achieved lubrication efficiency comparable to a grade of magnesium stearate (MgSt) without deteriorating tabletability. Moreover, SLS-containing tablets of celecoxib also exhibited improved in vitro dissolution compared to MgSt-containing tablets.

The present study aimed to further develop a surgical technique for autologous UTx in a non-human primate species and to assess long-term function. METHODS Female baboons (n= 16) underwent autologous transplantation of the uterus with the Fallopian tubes and ovaries, performed with a previously published surgical technique (n= 6, Group 1) or using a modified technique (n= 10; Group 2). The uterine arteries were dissected to the proximal end of the anterior branch (Group 1) or the entire (Group 2) internal iliac artery, and the ovarian veins were dissected to the crossing over the ureter (Group 1) or further cranially to include greater lengths and patches of the cava/renal vein (Group 2). Back-table preparation created common venous and arterial ends with arterial anastomosis either end-to-side to the left external iliac artery (Group 1) or end-to-end to the left internal iliac artery (Group 2). RESULTS Overall short-time survival of the animals was 88% (66% in Group 1 and 100% in Group 2). Of all the operated animals, 75% (66% in Group 1 and 80% in Group 2) resumed ovarian cyclicity. Regular menstruation after UTx was demonstrated only in Group 2 (60%). Menstruating animals (n= 6) were each exposed to timed mating for ≥5 menstrual cycles, but pregnancy did not occur. Adhesions and tubal blockage were seen in post-mortem analysis. CONCLUSIONS The modified UTx model of Group 2 is a safe procedure and shows resumed long-term uterine function in a majority of the animals, although pregnancy could not be demonstrated.","Johannesson, L; Enskog, A; Dahm-Kähler, P; Hanafy, A; Chai, D C; Mwenda, J M; Díaz-García, C; Olausson, M; Brännström, M",Human reproduction,155,13

Methods This longitudinal prospective national cohort study included all surviving ELBW (birth weight <1000 g) children born in Finland in 1996 to 1997. No children were excluded from the study. Perinatal, neonatal, and follow-up data up to the age of 5 years of these children were registered in the national birth register. According to birth register, the study population included all infants born at the age under 27 gestational weeks. At 11 years of age general cognitive ability was tested with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, ADHD behavior evaluated with a report from each child's own teacher (ADHD Rating Scale IV), and school performance with a parental questionnaire. An ELBW subpopulation consisting of a cohort representative children from the two university hospitals from two regions (n = 63) and the age-matched full-term born controls born in Helsinki university hospital (n = 30) underwent Movement Assessment Battery for Children and Touwen neurological examination comprising developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and minor neurological dysfunction (MND), respectively. Results Of 206 ELBW survivors 122 (73% of eligible) children and 30 (100%) full-term control children participated in assessments. ELBW children had lower full-scale intellectual quotient than controls (t-test, 90 vs 112, P < .001), elevated teacher- reported inattention scores (median = 4.0 vs 1.0, P = .021, r = .20) and needed more educational support (47% vs 17%, OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.6-12.4, P = .02). In the subpopulation, the incidences of DCD were 30% in ELBW and 7% in control children (P = .012, OR 6.0 CI 1.3-27.9), and complex MND 12.5% and 0%, (P = .052; RR 1.1 95% CI 1.04-1.25), respectively. Of survivors born in 24 to 26 gestational weeks, 29% had normal outcome. Conclusion As the majority of the extremely preterm born children had some problems, long-term follow-up is warranted to identify those with special needs and to design individual multidisciplinary support programs.","Tommiska, Viena; Lano, Aulikki; Kleemola, Päivi; Klenberg, Liisa; Lehtonen, Liisa; Löppönen, Tuija; Olsen, Päivi; Tammela, Outi; Fellman, Vineta",Health science reports,155,16

Investigating the current evidence is therefore crucial in this pandemic, as early rehabilitation could be effective for the functioning of patients with multiple organ failure. This rapid review assesses the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions in adults with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. METHODS A rapid review was conducted including only randomised control trials, published until 30 November 2020. All databases were investigated and the results synthesized narratively, evaluating the risk of bias and quality of evidence in all included studies. RESULTS A total of 404 records were identified through database searches. After removal of duplicates 346 articles remained. After screening, 3 studies (90 participants) met the inclusion criteria. All studies reported positive effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on muscle mass preservation compared with no treatment or standard physio-therapy. CONCLUSION The lack of evidence on the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions does not allow any firm conclusion to be drawn. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation might be a possible rehabilitation intervention to prevent muscle volume loss and improve function in patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. However, further studies are needed to support these preliminary findings.","Arienti, Chiara; Lazzarini, Stefano; Pollini, Elisa; Patrini, Michele; Kiekens, Carlotte; Negrini, Stefano",Journal of rehabilitation medicine,155,16

In this study, we examined long-term trends in groundwater levels across the DMR from 1996 to 2018. Station level data collected by the Central Groundwater Board for 258 stations at the seasonal scale were visualized and interpreted using geospatial analysis. The spatial patterns of the trends in groundwater levels revealed increasing depths of groundwater levels, except the Yamuna River floodplains. The main cause for the decline is related to the rapid growth in population accompanied with high-density impervious urban land uses, leading to lower levels of recharge vs unlimited withdrawal of groundwater for daily needs. In addition, the local geology in the form of clayey soils in northwest DMR also contributed to the lower levels of recharge. The results of the analysis enabled us to establish the trend and delineate the zones of differential recharge. Furthermore, the level of contaminants were analyzed at the district level for fluorides and nitrates. The presence of fluoride contamination was mostly concentrated in the northwestern district, while the nitrate exceedance was more widespread. These findings will help in achieving the 6th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of United Nations by 2030 as well as goals identified in Delhi's master plan of 2041.","Roy, Shouraseni Sen; Rahman, Atiqur; Ahmed, Shakeel; Shahfahad,; Ahmad, Ishita Afreen",Environmental monitoring and assessment,155,29

Patients having anesthesia for advanced EGD procedures, such as interventional procedures, are at high risk for hypoxemia. METHODS Our primary study aim was to evaluate whether high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen reduces the incidence of hypoxemia during anesthesia for advanced EGD. Secondarily, we studied whether HFNC oxygen reduces hypercarbia or hypotension. After obtaining written informed consent, adults having anesthesia for advanced EGD, expected to last longer than 15 minutes, were randomly assigned to receive HFNC oxygen or standard nasal cannula (SNC) oxygen. The primary outcome was occurrence of one or more hypoxemia events during anesthesia, defined by arterial oxygen saturation <92% for at least 15 consecutive seconds. Secondary outcomes were occurrence of one or more hypercarbia or hypotension events. A hypercarbia event was defined by a transcutaneous CO2 measurement 20 mm Hg or more above baseline, and a hypotension event was defined by a mean arterial blood pressure measurement 25% or more below baseline. RESULTS Two hundred seventy-one adult patients were enrolled and randomized, and 262 patients completed study procedures. Eight randomized patients did not complete study procedures due to changes in their anesthesia or endoscopy plan. One patient was excluded from analysis because their procedure was aborted after 1 minute. Patients who received HFNC oxygen (N = 132) had a significantly lower incidence of hypoxemia than those who received SNC oxygen (N = 130; 21.2% vs 33.1%; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.59 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.36-0.95]; P = .03). There was no difference in the incidence of hypercarbia or hypotension between the groups. The HR for hypercarbia with HFNC oxygen was 1.29 (95% CI, 0.89-1.88; P = .17), and the HR for hypotension was 1.25 (95% CI, 0.86-1.82; P = .25). CONCLUSIONS HFNC oxygen reduces the incidence of hypoxemia during anesthesia for advanced EGD and may offer an opportunity to enhance patient safety during these procedures.","Mazzeffi, Michael A; Petrick, Kendra M; Magder, Laurence; Greenwald, Bruce D; Darwin, Peter; Goldberg, Eric M; Bigeleisen, Paul; Chow, Jonathan H; Anders, Megan; Boyd, Cynthia M; Kaplowitz, Jeremy S; Sun, Kai; Terrin, Michael; Rock, Peter",Anesthesia and analgesia,155,1

Methods A literature search was performed after PROSPERO registration (CRD42020200842) and reported in compliance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methods. We conducted a systematic search of Medline (Ovid), Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO/ICTRP from inception to November 20, 2020. Manuscripts and published abstracts were included if they involved testis-sparing surgery (TSS) and contained data on any outcomes related to fertility, hormonal parameters, or oncological control, or if they evaluated surgical technique. Results Our initial search yielded 3,370 manuscripts, with 269 of these screened for full-text eligibility. After our exclusion criteria were applied, 32 studies were included in the final analysis. Oncological outcomes were obtained from 12 studies (average follow-up 57.8 months), functional data from 26 studies (average follow-up 49.6 months), fertility information from 10 studies (average follow-up 55.8 months), and data on nonpalpable tumors from 11 studies (average follow-up 32.1 months). Oncological control appears to be excellent in studies that reported these outcomes. Presence of germ cell neoplasia in situ was controlled with adjuvant radiation in nearly all cases. Functional outcomes are also promising, as development of primary and compensated hypogonadism was rare. Semen parameters are poor preoperatively among men with benign and malignant testis tumors, with occasional decline after TSS. Frozen section analysis at the time of surgery appears to be very reliable, and the majority of nonpalpable tumors appear to be benign. Conclusions TSS is a safe and efficacious technique with regards to oncological control and postoperative hormonal function based on retrospective, noncontrolled studies. TSS avoids unnecessary removal of benign testicular tissue, and should be given serious consideration in cases of nonpalpable, small tumors under 2 cm. In cases of malignancy, TSS can safely avoid anorchia in men with bilateral tumors and in men with solitary testicles. The use of the operating microscope, while theoretically promising, does not necessarily lead to better outcomes, however data are limited.","Ory, Jesse; Blankstein, Udi; Gonzalez, Daniel C; Sathe, Aditya A; White, Joshua T; Delgado, Carlos; Reynolds, John; Jarvi, Keith; Ramasamy, Ranjith",BJUI compass,155,16

We hypothesize that the observed inability is a consequence of light-induced rearrangement of CDW stacking across the layers of 1T-TaS2.

The current drugs for treating neuropathies have limited efficacies or show important side effects, and the development of analgesics with novel modes of action is critical. The identification of endogenous anti-nociceptive factors has emerged as an attractive strategy for designing new pharmacological approaches to treat neuropathic pain. Cortistatin is a neuropeptide with potent anti-inflammatory activity, recently identified as a natural analgesic peptide in several models of pain evoked by inflammatory conditions. Here, we investigated the potential analgesic effect of cortistatin in neuropathic pain using a variety of experimental models of peripheral nerve injury caused by chronic constriction or partial transection of the sciatic nerve or by diabetic neuropathy. We found that the peripheral and central injection of cortistatin ameliorated hyperalgesia and allodynia, two of the dominant clinical manifestations of chronic neuropathic pain. Cortistatin-induced analgesia was multitargeted, as it regulated the nerve damage-induced hypersensitization of primary nociceptors, inhibited neuroinflammatory responses, and enhanced the production of neurotrophic factors both at the peripheral and central levels. We also demonstrated the neuroregenerative/protective capacity of cortistatin in a model of severe peripheral nerve transection. Interestingly, the nociceptive system responded to nerve injury by secreting cortistatin, and a deficiency in cortistatin exacerbated the neuropathic pain responses and peripheral nerve dysfunction. Therefore, cortistatin-based therapies emerge as attractive alternatives for treating chronic neuropathic pain of different etiologies.","Falo, Clara P; Benitez, Raquel; Caro, Marta; Morell, Maria; Forte-Lago, Irene; Hernandez-Cortes, Pedro; Sanchez-Gonzalez, Clara; O'Valle, Francisco; Delgado, Mario; Gonzalez-Rey, Elena",Pharmaceutics,155,1

This study examined associations between PA, stress and stress management strategies during SIP. DESIGN AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Participants (N = 990) from a cohort of Northern California adults completed surveys during early SIP (3/23/20-4/2/20) and mid-SIP (4/24/20-5/8/20). Participants self-reported past-month PA (meeting vs. not meeting guidelines), changes in stress (decreased/unchanged vs. increased) and use (yes/no) of 10 stress management strategies. We tested differences in mid-SIP stress and stress management strategies by PA, and differences in mid-SIP stress by stress management strategies. RESULTS Compared to participants inactive at mid-SIP, active participants reported less stress (AOR = 0.60 [0.45, 0.81]). Active participants were more likely to manage stress using outdoor PA, indoor PA, yoga/meditation/prayer, gardening, and reading (AORs > 1.42), and less likely to sleep (AOR = 0.65 [0.48, 0.89]) or eat ([AOR = 0.48 [0.35, 0.66]) more. Managing stress using outdoor PA, indoor PA or reading was associated with lower stress; managing stress using TV/movies, sleeping or eating was associated with increased stress (ps < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Meeting PA guidelines during SIP was associated with less stress. Inactive participants reported greater sleeping and eating to cope; active participants used active stress management strategies. Engagement in physically active stress management was associated with lower stress.","Vogel, Erin A; Zhang, Janice S; Peng, Katy; Heaney, Catherine A; Lu, Ying; Lounsbury, David; Hsing, Ann W; Prochaska, Judith J",Psychology & health,155,5

METHODS We systematically searched for full-text publications of VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza from TND studies in outpatient settings after the 2009/10 influenza pandemic. Two reviewers independently selected and extracted data from the included studies. We calculated pooled adjusted VE across geographical regions, age groups and levels of vaccine antigenic similarity with circulating virus strains, using an inverse variance, random-effects model. RESULTS We included 76 full-text articles from 11,931 citations. VE estimates against A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), influenza B, and all influenza were homogenous and point pooled VE higher in the Southern hemisphere compared with the Northern hemisphere. The difference in pooled VE between the Southern and Northern hemispheres was statistically significant for A(H3N2), influenza B, and all influenza. A consistent pattern was observed in pooled VE across both hemispheres and continents, with the highest point pooled VE being against A(H1N1)pdm09, followed by influenza B, and lowest against A(H3N2). A nearly consistent pattern was observed in pooled VE across age groups in the Northern hemisphere, with pooled VE mostly decreasing with age. Point pooled VE against A(H3N2), influenza B, and all influenza were statistically significantly higher when vaccine was antigenically similar to circulating virus strains compared with when antigenically dissimilar. Similar pattern was observed in the Northern hemisphere, but there was a lack of data from the Southern hemisphere. CONCLUSION Consistent patterns appear to exist in seasonal influenza VE across regions, age groups, and levels of vaccine antigenic similarity with circulating virus strains, with best vaccine performance against A(H1N1)pdm09 and worst against A(H3N2). The evidence highlights the need to consider geographical location, age, and vaccine antigenic similarity with circulating virus strains when designing and evaluating influenza VE studies.","Okoli, G N; Racovitan, F; Abdulwahid, T; Righolt, C H; Mahmud, S M",Vaccine,155,1

More specifically, we note detrimental effects of increased isolation since the implementation of COVID-19 safety measures, including stakeholders' reports of higher incidences of relapse, overdose, and deaths in the SUD population. Treatment providers have responded with telehealth services, but faced barriers in technology access and computer literacy among clients. Providers have also had to restrict new clients to accommodate social distancing, faced delays in health screening those they can accept, and denied family visitations, which has affected retention. In light of these challenges, several promising lessons for the future emerged--such as preparing for an influx of new and returning clients in need of SUD treatment; making arrangements for long-term housing and facility modification; developing a hybrid care delivery model, taking advantage of new regulations enabling telemedicine; budgeting for and storing personal protective equipment (PPE) and related supplies; and developing disaster protocols to withstand threats to intake, retention, and financial solvency.","Kedia, Satish K; Schmidt, Michael; Dillon, Patrick J; Arshad, Hassan; Yu, Xinhua",Journal of substance abuse treatment,155,1

Current surgical guidelines limit transanal excision of early rectal neoplasia to 8 cm from the anal verge. We report that R0 resection of higher rectal cancers is possible using transanal robotic microsurgery. METHODS/INTERVENTIONS Ten cases of robotic assisted transanal surgery for early stage disease (T0-T1, N0) between 2013 and 2016 were reviewed. RESULTS/OUTCOMES All cases were diagnosed preoperatively with colonoscopy, and the average distance from the anal verge was 11.1 cm. The average operative time was 167 minutes, and the average blood loss was 37.5 cc. Four cases required intraoperative conversion; one conversion required robotic abdominal access to repair a proctotomy. All margins were histologically negative, and 6-month follow-up showed no recurrences.

METHODS Two hundred twenty-two patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia were randomly allocated to Group J (n = 111) or Group 60° (n = 111) and intubated using the MVL with the stylet bent into the allocated shape. The time to intubation (TTI) and other intubating profiles were compared between the groups. Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between factors related to difficult intubation and TTI. RESULTS The TTI was not different between the two groups. There were also no differences in the intubating profiles between the two groups. In both groups, the TTI was longer with a modified Mallampati score (mMS) of ≥3 and percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score of <50. In Group J, the TTI was longer with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥30 kg/m2. CONCLUSION The TTI during tracheal intubation with the MVL was not different between the two groups.

Ocular manifestations have been reported including conjunctivitis and retinal changes. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to clarify eye involvement in COVID-19 in order to help with its diagnosis and to further prevent its transmission. The purpose of this review is to describe the structure and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, reported ocular findings and protection strategies for ophthalmologists. MATERIAL AND METHODS Literature search on PubMed for relevant articles using the keywords 'COVID-19', 'coronavirus', and 'SARS-CoV-2' in conjunction with 'ophthalmology' and 'eye'. Moreover, official recommendations of ophthalmological societies were reviewed. RESULTS Although the conjunctiva is directly exposed to extraocular pathogens, and the mucosa of the ocular surface and upper respiratory tract are connected by the nasolacrimal duct, the eye is rarely involved in human SARS-CoV-2 infection and the SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive rate by RT-PCR test in tears and conjunctival secretions from patients with COVID-19 is also extremely low. DISCUSSION The eye can be affected by SARS-CoV-2, which is supported by some reports of conjunctivitis and retinal changes, but its role in the spread of the disease is still unknown. CONCLUSION Given the current scarce evidence, more research is needed to clarify the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the eye.","Torres-Costa, Sónia; Lima-Fontes, Mário; Falcão-Reis, Fernando; Falcão, Manuel",Acta medica portuguesa,155,31

Given the aging population, the continued threat of diabetes and obesity worldwide, and the persistent problem of infection, it is expected that chronic wounds will continue to be a substantial clinical, social and economic challenge. In 2020, the COVID pandemic dramatically disrupted healthcare worldwide including in the arena of wound care. A chronic nonhealing wound (CNHW) is typically correlated with comorbidities such as diabetes, vascular deficits, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. These risk factors make persons with CNHW at high-risk for severe, sometimes lethal outcomes if infected with SARS-CoV2 (pathogen causing COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted several aspects of the wound care continuum including compliance with wound care visits, prompting alternative approaches (use of telemedicine, creation of videos to help with wound dressing changes among others), encouraging a do-it-yourself wound dressing protocol and use of home-made remedies/substitutions. Recent Advances: There is a developing interest in understanding how the social determinants of health impacts the quality of life and outcomes of wound care patients. Furthermore, addressing wound care in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of telemedicine options in the continuum of care. FUTURE DIRECTIONS The economic, clinical and social impact of wounds continues to rise and requires appropriate investment and a structured approach to wound care, education and related research.","Sen, Chandan K",Advances in wound care,155,20

Animal data and human studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) increase the expression of ACE2. ACE2 is an enzyme found in the heart, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and lung and is a coreceptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), the virus responsible for COVID-19. Therefore, one can speculate that discontinuing ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy may lead to decreased ACE2 expression, thereby attenuating the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, and mitigating the disease progression of COVID-19. However, several studies have also shown that ACE2 exhibits reno- and cardioprotection and preserves lung function in acute respiratory distress syndrome, which would favor ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy. This article is to examine and summarize the 2 opposing viewpoints and provide guideline recommendations to support the use or discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with COVID-19.","Shyh, Grace I; Nawarskas, James J; Cheng-Lai, Angela",Cardiology in review,155,8

This study aimed to directly assess pancreatic fatty infiltration with preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging and to investigate whether a preoperative analysis of patient variables, including CT characteristics and clinical factors, can predict POPF. METHODS We enrolled 150 consecutive patients who underwent curative pancreatectomy. Radiographic factors, including pancreatic fat volume, were measured using preoperative CT imaging and the predictive factors were explored using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS POPF developed in 30 patients (20.0%). The ratio of pancreatic fat (RPF) ≥ 4.83% was associated with a risk of POPF, high body mass index (BMI), and obese body habitus. Patients with POPF were significantly more likely to have high BMI (≥ 25 kg/m2), obese body habitus, and an RPF ≥ 4.83% than patients without POPF. In the multivariate analysis, visceral fat area/skeletal muscle index (VFA/SMI) ≥ 1.94 (odds ratio [OR] 4.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43-12.9, p = 0.0095) was the sole independent predictive factor for POPF. For patients with a soft pancreas, VFA/SMI ≥ 1.94 (OR 5.67, 95% CI 2.05-15.7, p = 0.0008) was again the sole independent predictive factor for POPF. CONCLUSION Preoperative CT images can examine pancreatic fatty infiltration, and patients who had POPF were significantly associated with a high RPF. Among several parameters, VFA/SMI was the only independent predictive factor for clinically relevant POPF. Preoperative evaluation of these body composition variables and the pancreatic configuration could be useful for predicting POPF.","Tanaka, Katsuhito; Yamada, Suguru; Sonohara, Fuminori; Takami, Hideki; Hayashi, Masamichi; Kanda, Mitsuro; Kobayashi, Daisuke; Tanaka, Chie; Nakayama, Goro; Koike, Masahiko; Fujiwara, Michitaka; Kodera, Yasuhiro",Annals of surgical oncology,155,5

Older classification systems regarding timing to reconstruction do not take into account recent improvements in critical care, wound vacuum-assisted closure use, or next-generation antibiotic therapies, which may prolong time to reconstruction. METHODS Records of patients undergoing sternal wound reconstruction performed by the senior author (J.A.A.) from 1996 to 2018 at a high-volume cardiac surgery center were reviewed. Indications included sternal wound infection or dehiscence. All patients underwent single-stage removal of hardware, débridement, and flap closure. Patients were divided into two groups based on timing of wound closure after cardiac surgery: less than 30 days or greater than or equal to 30 days. RESULTS Of the 505 patients identified during the study period, 330 had sufficient data for analysis. Mean time to sternal wound surgery was 15.7 days in the early group compared to 64.4 days (p < 0.01) beyond 30 days. Postdébridement cultures were positive in 72 percent versus 62.5 percent of patients (p = 0.11), whereas rates of postoperative infection were significantly higher in the delayed group: 1.9 percent versus 9.5 percent (p < 0.01). Partial wound dehiscence rates were also higher after 30 days (1.9 percent versus 11.3 percent; p < 0.01), whereas total length of stay was decreased. Use of wound vacuum-assisted closure was significantly associated with reconstruction beyond 30 days (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Although performing sternal wound reconstruction more than 30 days after initial cardiac surgery was associated with a shorter overall hospital length of stay and higher extubation rates in the operating room, these patients also had elevated postoperative infection and wound complication rates. The authors thus recommend not delaying definitive surgical reconstruction when possible.

The addition of one or multiple PEG moieties, in either linear or branched form, is known to carry the risk of potentially inducing an immunogenic response against PEG. The importance of accurately quantifying anti-PEG antibodies during a clinical study is well recognized and stems from the fact that anti-PEG antibodies have been shown to negatively impact the efficacy of the biotherapeutic that the PEG is coupled to. As a consequence, sponsors are encouraged to develop immunogenicity assays to assess appropriately the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against the protein component as well as the PEG. However, detection of anti-PEG antibodies is complicated by a number of technical challenges, including the availability of appropriate positive control material. In addition, the fact that some anti-PEG antibodies are known to circulate as low-affinity IgM, drives the need for an assay able to detect low affinity anti-PEG ADA even in the presence of high concentrations of the biotherapeutic. To address this need, we developed and validated an Affinity Capture Elution (ACE)-AGL assay to detect anti-drug and anti-PEG antibodies. In this assay, which we call ACE-AGL, ADA are captured by biotin-PEG-drug, acid eluted and re-captured on a second plate coated with protein AGL. ADA are then detected using Ruthenium-PEG-drug. The new assay format described is highly sensitive to both anti-drug and anti-PEG antibodies and very drug-tolerant. The ACE-AGL assay is easy to perform and has been successfully validated at two separate CROs. We propose the ACE-AGL format as a valid and effective alternative to the currently available assay methods.","Bivi, Nicoletta; Swearingen, Craig A; Shockley, Travis; Sloan, John H; Pottanat, Thomas G; Carter, Quincy; Hodsdon, Michael; Siegel, Robert; Konrad, Robert J",Journal of immunological methods,155,1

RECENT FINDINGS Several studies have shown that there are three main themes in the epidemiology of stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic: COVID-19 seems to be associated with stroke in a significant number of patients. This association has been reported in several clinical series, mainly from China. There is a consistent trend towards a decreased number of hospital admissions of stroke patients during the pandemic. There are no population-based data available on incident stroke in individuals with COVID-19. SUMMARY In this review, we report on increased rates and severe prognosis of ischemic stroke among individuals with COVID-19, probably explained by hypercoagulability and inflammation, documented since the early phase of disease.We confirm the presence of falling rates of new ischemic stroke admissions in hospitals, probably due to social consequences of the pandemic: fear to be infected or not adequately treated in the hospital. This phenomenon is restricted to mild stroke and transient ischemic attacks.Short and long-term consequences of this trend of new strokes in the pandemic need to be evaluated.","Logroscino, Giancarlo; Beghi, Ettore",Current opinion in neurology,155,1

The host immunity of COVID-19 patients is unknown. METHODS The routine laboratory tests and host immunity in COVID-19 patients with different severity of illness were compared after patient admission. RESULTS A total of 65 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were classified as mild (n=30), severe (n=20), and extremely severe (n=15) illness. Many routine laboratory tests such as ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase and D-dimer were increased in severe and extremely severe patients. The absolute numbers of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and B cells were all gradually decreased with increased severity of illness. The activation markers such as HLA-DR and CD45RO expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were increased in severe and extremely severe patients compared with mild patients. The co-stimulatory molecule CD28 had opposite results. The percentage of natural regulatory T cells was decreased in extremely severe patients. The percentage of IFN-γ producing CD8+ T cells was increased in both severe and extremely severe patients compared with mild patients. The percentage of IFN-γ producing CD4+ T cells was increased in extremely severe patients. The IL-2R, IL-6, and IL-10 were all increased in extremely severe patients. The activation of DC and B cells was decreased in extremely severe patients. CONCLUSIONS The number and function of T cells are inconsistent in COVID-19 patients.

Here we use a murine model for evaluation of the induction of humoral and cellular immune responses by inactivated and PHE-CoV DNA vaccines in order to define the immune correlates for protection against PHE-CoV. The inactivated vaccine was composed of purified PHE-CoV and aluminum hydroxide gel (alum), which was chosen as an adjuvant because of its long history of safety for human use. The PHE-CoV DNA vaccine was constructed by subcloning the S1 gene of PHE-CoV into the pVAX1 vector to create the recombinant plasmid pV-S1. Our results showed that the inactivated PHE-CoV vaccine (IPV) elicited a high level of humoral immunity, resulting in good protection efficacy against PHE-CoV challenge. The IPV induced the IgG1 subclass of serum antibodies and expression of the cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4), suggesting that the IPV generated a predominantly Th2-type immune response. The DNA vaccine was found to mediate primarily a cellular immune response with high levels of IgG2a and the cytokines IL-2 and gamma interferon (IFN-γ). However, mice that were vaccinated twice with the DNA vaccine and boosted with the IPV could mount a sufficient neutralizing antibody response against live PHE-CoV, with little variation in IgG1 and IgG2a levels, and showed high levels of IL-2 and IL-4. This response may activate both B and T cells to mount a specific humoral and cellular immune response that could, in turn, elicit a phagocyte-mediated defense against PHE-CoV infections to achieve viral clearance.","Chen, Keyan; Zhao, Kui; He, Wenqi; Gao, Wei; Zhao, Chuanbo; Wang, Li; Pan, Wei; Song, Deguang; Wang, Chengli; Gao, Feng",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,155,7

METHODS The study adhered to ENTREQ (Confidence in Evidence of Reviews of Qualitative Research) guidelines. See Supplemental File 1. A systematic search of the literature in nine databases was undertaken: CINAHL, Web of Science, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Campbell Collaboration, Proquest A & I, DART, Lenus. Blind screening to select relevant studies was undertaken and each selected study was assessed for quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme framework (CASP). Guided by Thomas and Harden's three-stage approach to thematic analysis, line-by-line coding of participants' verbatim accounts and the researchers' interpretations in the selected studies' findings was undertaken and then organised into higher order analytical themes. Confidence in the findings were reviewed using GRADE-CERQual. RESULTS Twelve studies reported in thirteen papers, including 122 nurses were selected in the final sample for synthesis. Three analytical themes were identified: 1) sometimes machines get all the attention 2) with experience the patient becomes the focus, and 3) technology can't save everybody. CONCLUSIONS Providing care for adult patients in a highly technological environment is challenging particularly for novice nurses, who face the potential of technology drawing all their attention. Experienced critical care nurses learn to keep technology in abeyance and deliver person-centred care within the bounds of a technological environment. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE The review supports Locsin's theory of technological competence and highlights that providing care in critical care requires nurses to actively balance attention for the person while managing machines. Experienced nurses achieve this balance and can offer support to novice nurses. Critical care nurse orientation programmes should be underpinned by a holistic approach which addresses the dualism of technology and care. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS We tried to identify the most difficult differential diagnoses encountered in a tertiary center of pancreatology and to guide the reader as how to reach the correct strategy and diagnosis in these situations. RESULTS We identified eight clinically difficult situations: i) chronic pancreatitis versus intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, ii) serous versus mucinous cystic neoplasms, iii) serous cystic neoplasms versus branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, iv) intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms versus acinar cell cystadenoma, v) (pseudo-) solid serous cystic neoplasm versus neuroendocrine tumor, vi) pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors versus solid pseudopapillary tumors, vii) cystic forms of a solid tumor, and viii) rare pancreatic or peripancreatic cystic lesions. The work-up should rely on computed tomography scan, pancreatic magnetic resonance imaging, and, only if necessary, endoscopic ultrasound with or without fine needle aspiration.

As a network modifier, Na+ cations modify the structural distributions and create nonbridging oxygens. As a charge compensator, Na+ cations provide imbalanced charge for oxygen that is linked between two network-forming tetrahedra. However, the factors controlling the mobility of Na+ ions in glasses, which in turn affects the ionic conductivity, remain unclear. In the current work, using high-fidelity experiments and atomistic simulations, we demonstrate that the ionic conductivity of the Na3Al2P3O12 (Si0) glass material is dependent not only on the concentration of Na+ charge carriers but also on the number of charge-compensated oxygens within its first coordination sphere. To investigate, we chose a series of glasses formulated by the substitution of Si for P in Si0 glass based on the hypothesis that Si substitution in the presence of Na+ cations increases the number of Si-O-Al bonds, which enhances the role of Na as a charge compensator. The structural and conductivity properties of bulk glass materials are evaluated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance, Raman spectroscopy, and impedance spectroscopy. We observe that the increasing number of charge-imbalanced bridging oxygens (BOs) with the substitution of Si for P in Si0 glass enhances the ionic conductivity by an order of magnitude-from 3.7 × 10-8 S.cm-1 to 3.3 × 10-7 S.cm-1 at 100 °C. By rigorously quantifying the channel regions in the glass structure, using MD simulations, we demonstrate that the enhanced ionic conductivity can be attributed to the increased connectivity of Na-rich channels because of the increased charge-compensated BOs around the Na atoms. Overall, this study provides new insights for designing next-generation glass-based electrolytes with superior ionic conductivity for Na-ion batteries.","Keshri, Shweta R; Ganisetti, Sudheer; Kumar, Rajesh; Gaddam, Anuraag; Illath, Kavya; Ajithkumar, Thalasseril G; Balaji, Sathravada; Annapurna, K; Nasani, Narendar; Krishnan, N M Anoop; Allu, Amarnath R",Inorganic chemistry,155,7

Additionally, N protein participates in at least one stage of the complex mechanism of coronavirus RNA synthesis. We previously uncovered an unanticipated interaction between N and the largest subunit of the viral replicase-transcriptase complex, nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). This was found through analysis of revertants of a severely defective mutant of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) in which the N gene was replaced with that of its close relative, bovine coronavirus (BCoV). In the work reported here, we constructed BCoV chimeras and other mutants of MHV nsp3 and obtained complementary genetic evidence for its association with N protein. We found that the N-nsp3 interaction maps to the amino-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of nsp3, which is essential for the virus. The interaction does not require the adjacent acidic domain of nsp3, which is dispensable. In addition, we demonstrated a complete correspondence between N-nsp3 genetic interactions and the ability of N protein to enhance the infectivity of transfected coronavirus genomic RNA. The latter function of N was shown to depend on both of the RNA-binding domains of N, as well as on the serine- and arginine-rich central region of N, which binds nsp3. Our results support a model in which the N-nsp3 interaction serves to tether the genome to the newly translated replicase-transcriptase complex at a very early stage of infection.","Hurst, Kelley R; Koetzner, Cheri A; Masters, Paul S",Journal of virology,155,20

However, neuropsychological assessment is not usually included as routine practice in alcohol rehabilitation programs. The aim of this study was to describe qualitatively the cognitive deficits in early-detoxified AUD patients undergoing rehabilitation and to explore relevant associations with socio-demographic, clinical and psychological factors. Patients and Methods Forty-one patients with a diagnosis of AUD were consecutively recruited from a residential rehabilitation hospital in Northern Italy. Cognitive impairment was assessed using the Brief Neuropsychological Examination 2 (ENB-2). Anxiety, depression and severity of alcohol dependence were also evaluated using validated self-report questionnaires. Alcohol relapse was investigated 1 month after discharge. Results Overall, 31.7% of AUD patients showed cognitive impairments according to the global score scale. However, 70.7% had an impaired performance on at least one test of the ENB-2, with particular regard to executive function, visuospatial and memory domains. Age, education and abstinence at admission were the most relevant factors associated with cognitive deficits in this clinical population. Conclusion The detection of cognitive impairments is essential in order to adapt alcohol rehabilitation treatment to patients with cognitive deficits and enhance clinical outcomes.","Caneva, Stefano; Ottonello, Marcella; Torselli, Elisa; Pistarini, Caterina; Spigno, Paola; Fiabane, Elena",Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,155,1

The clinical characteristics of patients with advanced emphysema and chronic bronchitis have not been well described. METHODS Patients randomized to medical therapy in the National Emphysema Treatment Trial were grouped based on their reports of cough and phlegm on the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire(SGRQ) at baseline: chronic bronchitis(CB+) and no chronic bronchitis(CB-). The patients were similarly categorized into severe chronic bronchitis(SCB+) or no severe chronic bronchitis (SCB-) based on the above definition plus report of chest trouble. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to determine the relationships between chronic bronchitis and severe chronic bronchitis and survival and time to hospitalization. Lung function and SGRQ scores over time were compared between groups. RESULTS The CB+(N = 234; 38%) and CB- groups(N = 376; 62%) had similar survival (median 60.8 versus 65.7 months, p = 0.19) and time to hospitalization (median 26.9 versus 24.9 months, p = 0.84). The SCB+ group(N = 74; 12%) had worse survival (median 47.7 versus 65.7 months, p = 0.02) and shorter time to hospitalization (median 18.5 versus 26.7 months, p = 0.02) than the SCB- group (N = 536; 88%). Mortality and hospitalization rates were not increased when chest trouble was analyzed by itself. The CB+ and CB-groups had similar lung function and SGRQ scores over time. The SCB+ and SCB-groups had similar lung function over time, but the SCB+ group had significantly worse SGRQ scores. CONCLUSIONS Severe chronic bronchitis is associated with worse survival, shorter time to hospitalization, and worse health-related quality of life.","Kim, Victor; Sternberg, Alice L; Washko, George; Make, Barry J; Han, Meilan K; Martinez, Fernando; Criner, Gerard J",COPD,155,20

On the basis of this success, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) was developed using similar somatostatin analogs with different therapeutic radionuclides. Clinical application of PRRT demonstrated impressive results on tumor response, overall survival, and quality of life in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. The peptides 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), Tyr(3)-octreotate (DOTATATE) and DOTA, Tyr(3)-octreotide (DOTATOC) (brand name Onalta), predominantly targeting sst(2), have been granted Orphan Drug status by the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration for application in PRRT. Besides somatostatin receptor-targeting peptides, multiple other radiopeptide analogs were developed targeting several other receptors overexpressed on various tumors. Some of these peptide analogs, including cholecystokinin, gastrin, gastrin-releasing peptide, arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD)-peptides, and glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs appeared very promising in preclinical and clinical imaging and PRRT studies. Although the success of PRRT with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs has been established, there is still room for improvement. The therapeutic window of PRRT could be enlarged by the use of new and improved targeting compounds, of which new antagonists with excellent tumor to background ratios are very promising. Furthermore, locoregional administration, improved healthy tissue protection, and combination treatment can be applied to increase the effectiveness of PRRT. Combination treatment might include cocktails of different peptide analogs of different therapeutic radionuclides and of radiolabeled peptides with chemotherapeutic or radiosensitizing agents. This review summarizes results of PRRT and describes clinical and preclinical studies regarding PRRT optimizing strategies.","Pool, Stefan E; Krenning, Eric P; Koning, Gerben A; van Eijck, Casper H J; Teunissen, Jaap J M; Kam, Boen; Valkema, Roelf; Kwekkeboom, Dik J; de Jong, Marion",Seminars in nuclear medicine,155,1

Recent evidence suggests that Inuit in this region have experienced systemic barriers to reproductive health with resulting disparities in reproductive health-related outcomes including those among youth. Northern youth-focused reproductive health intervention research or evaluations have not to date been well summarized. The objective of this scoping review was to summarize the literature over the past twenty years focusing on reproductive health interventions for adolescents in northern Inuit communities. METHODS English-language articles from 2000 to 2020 were identified from seven scientific databases, a general internet search and a review of relevant websites. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full texts and included articles if they mentioned a reproductive health intervention and pertained, directly or indirectly, to reproductive health for Inuit aged 10-19 in northern communities. RESULTS Seventeen articles met the inclusion criteria, across six themes: (1) Barriers to reproductive health interventions in the north; (2) Northern midwifery; (3) Northern birthing centres; (4) Fetal fibronectin tests for identifying high-risk pregnancies; (5) Prenatal education classes; and (6) Interventions to improve access to and quality of reproductive health supports. CONCLUSION Overall there is relatively limited evidence base specific to reproductive health interventions and northern Inuit youth. What does exist largely focuses on maternal health interventions and is inclusive of but not specific to youth. There is some evidence that youth specific educational programs, participatory action research approaches and the promotion of northern birthing centres and midwifery can improve reproductive health for adolescents and young mothers in northern Inuit communities. Future initiatives should focus on the creation and evaluation of culturally relevant and youth specific interventions and increasing community and youth participation in intervention research for better reproductive health.","Mikhail, Hannah; Kelly, Sarah E; Davison, Colleen M",Reproductive health,155,1

Barbed suture can be a fast and effective method of peritoneal closure. We report two rare cases of small bowel obstruction and perforation caused by barbed suture after TAPP. CASES Patient 1 is a 45-year-old man who underwent laparoscopic repair of a right inguinal hernia. Barbed suture was used to close the peritoneal defect. At 47 days after the operation, he was diagnosed with a small bowel obstruction caused by an elongated tail of the barbed suture. Emergency laparoscopic exploration was performed for removal of the embedded suture and detorsion of the volvulus. The second patient is a 50-year-old man who was admitted with a small bowel perforation one week after TAPP herniorrhaphy. Emergency exploration revealed that the tail of the barbed suture had pierced the small intestine, causing a tiny perforation. After cutting and releasing the redundant tail of the barbed suture, the serosal and muscular defect was closed with 2 absorbable single-knot sutures. Both patients have recovered well. Finally, we searched the PubMed database and reviewed the literature on the effectiveness and safety of barbed suture for TAPP. CONCLUSIONS Surgeons should understand the characteristics of barbed suture and master the technique of peritoneum closure during TAPP in order to reduce the risk of bowel obstruction and perforation.","Wang, Liming; Maejima, Taku; Fukahori, Susumu; Nishihara, Shoji; Yoshikawa, Daitaro; Kono, Toru",Surgical case reports,155,1

Identification of IBV was by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of RNA extracted from oropharyngeal swabs taken from poultry flocks exhibiting signs of clinical disease thought to be attributable to IBV. Part of the hypervariable S1 gene of IBV was sequenced to differentiate between the various genotypes. During the survey, 4103 samples were processed, of which 2419 (59%) were positive for IBV. The predominant IBV genotypes detected were 793B and Massachusetts. The third and fourth most common genotypes were two new economically important field types: Italy02, and a virus similar to genotypes originally detected in China called QX. Analysis of the partial S1 sequences of the genotypes detected suggested that approximately 50% of all 793B, Massachusetts types and D274 IBVs were identical to the homologous commercially available live vaccines. Since 2004 the prevalence of Italy02 (present in all countries from which samples were received) has been declining in all countries except Spain, where it appeared to be the predominant genotype. Since 2004 an IBV genotype has been detected in Holland, Germany, Belgium and France similar to QX and the incidence has increased. QX was not detected in the United Kingdom or Spain. When detections thought to be attributable to vaccines were removed, the dominant genotype in France and Europe overall was 793B; in Germany, Holland and Belgium, it was QX-like IBV; and in the United Kingdom and Spain the dominant genotype was Italy02. The present study is the first to identify the prevalence of both Italy02 and QX field-type variants in poultry flocks in Western Europe.

Under HFD, adipo-chemerin (-/-) mice showed improved glycolipid metabolism (decreases of TC, LDL, insulin and HOMA-IR) compared with flox (control) mice. Furthermore, OPLS-DA score plots found metabolites separations between adipo-chemerin (-/-) mice and flox mice fed with ND and HFD. Under HFD, 28 metabolites were significantly enhanced in adipo-chemerin (-/-) mice, and pathway enrichment analysis suggested strong relationship of the differential metabolites with arginine and proline metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, and phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, which were directly or indirectly related to lipid metabolism, inflammation and oxidative stress. Under ND, taurine was increased in adipo-chemerin (-/-) mice, involving in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism and primary bile acid biosynthesis.

This study was conducted to determine the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the patterns of PED visits. METHODS This is a retrospective observational study of visits to the PED of six hospitals, between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2020. We compared changes in the characteristics of patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS A total of 245,022 visits were included in this analysis. After the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Korea, we observed a significant decrease (54.2%) in PED visits compared to the annual average number of visits in the previous three years. Since then, the weekly number of PED visits decreased by 11.9 person/week (95% CI: -15.3 to -8.4, P<0.001), which included an increase of 0.21% (95% CI: 0.15% to 0.26%, P<0.001) per week in high acuity patients.

PAVF often leads to high morbidity and mortality. The aim of our study was to describe the clinical features and endovascular management of PAVF at various intracranial locations; to analyze the use of liquid embolic agents and coils alone or in combination in the treatment of PAVF and to analyze the outcome of embolization. Materials and Methods Retrospective review of diagnostic angiography and neurointerventional database of our institution identified a cohort of 15 patients with non-galenic PAVF from 2008 to 2014 out of 6750 patients. Fourteen patients were treated endovascularly with coils and liquid embolic materials in combination or alone. Patients were followed up for evaluation of prognosis. Results Age of the patients ranged from 3 to 37 years. Most patients were male and most common presentation was headache followed by seizure. Most common location of fistula was frontal lobe. The most common type was single artery single hole fistula with venous varix. Satisfactory obliteration was seen in all cases. One patient developed intraparenchymal hematoma on the first post procedural day and outcome was poor. Conclusions PAVF are rare intracranial vascular malformations which can effectively be managed endovascularly with liquid embolic, coils alone, or in combination.

Most commonly, host-associated bacteria interfere with host gene expression to modulate the immune response to the infection. However, many of these bacteria also interfere with host cellular differentiation pathways to create a hospitable niche, resulting in the formation of novel cell types, tissues, and organs. In both of these situations, bacterial symbionts must interact with eukaryotic regulatory pathways. Here, we detail what is known about how bacterial symbionts, from pathogens to mutualists, control host cellular differentiation across the central dogma, from epigenetic chromatin modifications, to transcription and mRNA processing, to translation and protein modifications. We identify four main trends from this survey. First, mechanisms for controlling host gene expression appear to evolve from symbionts co-opting cross-talk between host signaling pathways. Second, symbiont regulatory capacity is constrained by the processes that drive reductive genome evolution in host-associated bacteria. Third, the regulatory mechanisms symbionts exhibit correlate with the cost/benefit nature of the association. And, fourth, symbiont mechanisms for interacting with host genetic regulatory elements are not bound by native bacterial capabilities. Using this knowledge, we explore how the ubiquitous intracellular Wolbachia symbiont of arthropods and nematodes may modulate host cellular differentiation to manipulate host reproduction. Our survey of the literature on how infection alters gene expression in Wolbachia and its hosts revealed that, despite their intermediate-sized genomes, different strains appear capable of a wide diversity of regulatory manipulations. Given this and Wolbachia's diversity of phenotypes and eukaryotic-like proteins, we expect that many symbiont-induced host differentiation mechanisms will be discovered in this system.","Russell, Shelbi L; Castillo, Jennie Ruelas",Results and problems in cell differentiation,155,1

We tested ligand epitope antigen presentation system (LEAPS) technology as a new immune-based treatment for influenza virus infection in a mouse model. Influenza-J-LEAPS peptides were synthesized by conjugating the binding ligand derived from the β2-microglobulin chain of the human MHC class I molecule (J-LEAPS) with 15 to 30 amino acid-long peptides derived from influenza virus NP, M, or HA proteins. DCs were stimulated with influenza-J-LEAPS peptides (influenza-J-LEAPS) and injected intravenously into infected mice. Antigen-specific LEAPS-stimulated DCs were effective in reducing influenza virus replication in the lungs and enhancing survival of infected animals. Additionally, they augmented influenza-specific T cell responses in the lungs and reduced the severity of disease by limiting excessive cytokine responses, which are known to contribute to morbidity and mortality following influenza virus infection. Our data demonstrate that influenza-J-LEAPS-pulsed DCs reduce virus replication in the lungs, enhance survival, and modulate the protective immune responses that eliminate the virus while preventing excessive cytokines that could injure the host. This approach shows promise as an adjunct to antiviral treatment of influenza virus infections.","Boonnak, Kobporn; Vogel, Leatrice; Orandle, Marlene; Zimmerman, Daniel; Talor, Eyal; Subbarao, Kanta",The Journal of clinical investigation,155,1

However, the full understanding of their reaction mechanisms for and cysteine proteases inhibition is still elusive. Kinetic studies suggest an irreversible inhibition mechanism, which was explained by forming a covalent bond between the enzyme sulfhydryl group and the chalcogen atom at its hypervalent state (+4). In this work, we performed a theoretical investigation using density functional theory to propose the active inhibitor form in an aqueous solution. To this end, we investigated chloride ligand exchange reactions by oxygen and sulfur nucleophiles on hypervalent selenium and tellurium compounds. All tetra- and tri-coordinated chalcogen compounds and distinct protonation states of the nucleophiles were considered, totaling 34 unique species, 7 nucleophiles, and 155 free energies reactions. We discovered that chloride is easily replaced by a nonprotonated nucleophile (SH- or OH- ) in R2 SeCl2 . We also found that tri-coordinate species are more stable than their tetra-coordinate counterparts, with selenoxide (R2 SeO) protonation being strongly exergonic in acid pH. The thermodynamic and kinetic results suggest that the protonated selenoxide (R2 SeOH+ ) is the most probable active chemical species in biological media. The computed energetic profiles paint a possible picture for selenuranes activity, with successive exergonic steps leading to a covalent inhibition of thiol-dependent enzymes, like cysteine proteases. A second pathway has also been uncovered, with a direct reaction to chalcogenonium cation (R2 SeCl+ ) as the inhibition step. Tellurium compounds showed similar trends but formed telluroxide in a pH-independent fashion.","Dias-da-Silva, Gabriela; L O R Cunha, Rodrigo; D Coutinho-Neto, Mauricio",Journal of computational chemistry,155,29

According to our study, it is found that circRASSF2 sequences contain miR-1205 binding sites, and Homeobox gene A1 (HOXA1) is the target gene of miR-1205. Besides, the clinical observations and histopathologic study reveal that the expression of circRASSF2 increased to a significant extent in BC tissues and serum. Additionally, it is found that circRASSF2 expression had a positive correlation with distant metastasis, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, differentiation and tumor size, and that overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of circRASSF2 high expression BC patients were inferior to those with low circRASSF2 expression. In vitro study, an overt decrease was detected in the proliferation, clone formation ability, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in cells when circRASSF2 was knocked down. We confirmed the direct interaction between circRASSF2, miR-1205 and HOXA1 by a dual luciferase reporter system. Additionally, our study revealed that over-expression of miR-1205 decreased HOXA1 protein expression, and HOXA1 protein expression decreased when circRASSF2 were knocked down, and when miR-1205 expression was inhibited, HOXA1 expression was significantly increased. In conclusion, our study suggests that circRASSF2 regulates BC progression through the miR-1205/HOXA1 pathway. Our findings suggest the prospect of circRASSF2 serving as therapeutic target as such to cure BC patients.","Zhong, Wei; Bao, Lei; Yuan, Yangyi; Meng, Yanzhi",Bioengineered,155,17

There are concerns that rates of suicide and suicidal behaviour may rise during and in its aftermath. Our living systematic review synthesises findings from emerging literature on incidence and prevalence of suicidal behaviour as well as suicide prevention efforts in relation to COVID-19, with this iteration synthesising relevant evidence up to 19 th October 2020. Method: Automated daily searches feed into a web-based database with screening and data extraction functionalities. Eligibility criteria include incidence/prevalence of suicidal behaviour, exposure-outcome relationships and effects of interventions in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcomes of interest are suicide, self-harm or attempted suicide and suicidal thoughts. No restrictions are placed on language or study type, except for single-person case reports. We exclude one-off cross-sectional studies without either pre-pandemic measures or comparisons of COVID-19 positive vs. unaffected individuals. Results: Searches identified 6,226 articles. Seventy-eight articles met our inclusion criteria. We identified a further 64 relevant cross-sectional studies that did not meet our revised inclusion criteria. Thirty-four articles were not peer-reviewed (e.g. research letters, pre-prints). All articles were based on observational studies. There was no consistent evidence of a rise in suicide but many studies noted adverse economic effects were evolving. There was evidence of a rise in community distress, fall in hospital presentation for suicidal behaviour and early evidence of an increased frequency of suicidal thoughts in those who had become infected with COVID-19. Conclusions: Research evidence of the impact of COVID-19 on suicidal behaviour is accumulating rapidly. This living review provides a regular synthesis of the most up-to-date research evidence to guide public health and clinical policy to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on suicide risk as the longer term impacts of the pandemic on suicide risk are researched.","John, Ann; Eyles, Emily; Webb, Roger T; Okolie, Chukwudi; Schmidt, Lena; Arensman, Ella; Hawton, Keith; O'Connor, Rory C; Kapur, Nav; Moran, Paul; O'Neill, Siobhan; McGuiness, Luke A; Olorisade, Babatunde K; Dekel, Dana; Macleod-Hall, Catherine; Cheng, Hung-Yuan; Higgins, Julian P T; Gunnell, David",F1000Research,155,17

To explore how teamwork is taught (ie, skills and format), measured, and assessed within pharmacy education.Methods. A mapping review was conducted to provide a selection of articles to specifically capture how teamwork is taught, measured, and assessed within pharmacy education.Results. Of the 114 references retrieved, 18 studies from 17 schools or colleges of pharmacy met the inclusion criteria for review and data abstraction. Ten of the studies (56%) described how teamwork training was integrated into courses while the other eight studies described workshops, clinical rotations, modules, interprofessional simulations, long-term projects, and retreats on teamwork. Learning activities involving patient cases were the most common teaching method described (n=12, 67%). For the teamwork principles taught, all articles included leadership training or evaluating leadership skills in their program. To assess teamwork, 17 (94%) of the programs used students' self-reported measures of skills and behaviors, attitudes, and/or knowledge. Fourteen studies (78%) demonstrated improvements in students' attitude-related outcomes, 13 (72%) studies demonstrated improvements in skills-related outcomes, and six studies (33%) described improvements in knowledge related outcomes.Conclusion. Teamwork is regarded as an integral component of being an effective health care professional. While teamwork is common in pharmacy curricula, few studies describe strategies for teaching effective teamwork strategies to pharmacy students. The articles reviewed revealed a wide range of approaches to teaching, measuring, and assessing teamwork skills within pharmacy education. This review highlights an opportunity to further explore and identify the teamwork skills that are requisite for success in pharmacy practice, which could then be supported by standardized teamwork training programs and assessments.","Morbitzer, Kathryn A; Olsen, Amanda A; McLaughlin, Jacqueline E",American journal of pharmaceutical education,155,30

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to develop a novel multicomponent exercise program for individuals who work with computers during the COVID-19 quarantine. METHODS Researchers collaborating cross-institutionally and cross-nationally performed a careful literature search for exercise and stretching regiments with particular attention to methodologies that can be applied during the lockdown in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodologies were then compiled and truncated for ease of use for the computer-based office worker during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine. RESULTS The resulting program is broken down into three categories: aerobic, strengthening and stretching components. Each component can then be further modified to meet the frequency, intensity, time and type (FITT) specifications for the participant. CONCLUSIONS We present a novel, evidence-based strategy for functional fitness for office workers who have remained home-bound during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine.

There is evidence that lifestyle interventions, for example, exercise, dietary advice and smoking cessation programmes for service users with severe mental illness can be of health benefit. This review was carried out to identify the literature pertaining to physical health interventions for service users who have experienced a first-episode psychosis (FEP), to examine the nature of the interventions which were carried out and to assess these interventions in terms of feasibility and efficacy. METHODS A narrative review was conducted in August 2019 by searching 'Pubmed' and 'Embase' electronic databases. Studies investigating the effect a physical health intervention had on service users who had experienced a FEP were included in the review. RESULTS Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria: 12 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative. Exercise, dietary advice, smoking cessation and motivational coaching were some of the physical health interventions utilised in the identified studies. Positive effects were seen in terms of physical health markers wherever they were investigated, particularly when the intervention was delivered early. The impact on psychiatric symptoms and longer-term impacts on health were less frequently assessed. CONCLUSIONS Physical health interventions have a positive impact on service users who have experienced a FEP. More research is warranted in this area in Ireland. These studies should include controls, have longer follow-up periods and should assess the impact on psychiatric health.","Fouhy, Fergal; Cullen, Walter; O'Connor, Karen",Irish journal of psychological medicine,155,1

Health workers, by nature of their work, are a particularly at-risk population in the context of COVID-19. This article examines the legal standard of care that healthcare employers owe their staff in terms of reduction of risk exposure, both physically and psychologically, to COVID-19, the obligation to provide staff with personal protective equipment, adequate hygiene, cleaning and the consequences for breaching these standards. This article also explores the right to dismiss employees who are non-compliant with their obligations.What is known about the topic?It is well known that health workers are an at-risk population for COVID-19, particularly those with direct exposure to affected patients. Since early 2020, healthcare services have faced substantial challenges in managing employee risk while complying with Occupational, Health and Safety law in Australia.What does this paper add?This paper explores the standard of care that healthcare services owe their staff in terms of reduction of risk exposure within the current Australian legal framework, as well as the rights and obligations of healthcare service employees.What are the implications for practitioners?Health services should be aware of the range of legal obligations to protect healthcare workers from the consequences of COVID-19 in order to minimise risk as much as reasonably practicable for employees. This includes ensuring access to adequate personal protective equipment, psychological support, adequate hygiene and cleaning of the physical workspace as well as the appropriate reporting of incidents and exposures.","Dean, Jessica M; Panaccio, Danielle; Kevat, Dev; Farmer, Caitlin C; Pang, Sam C; Mahar, Patrick D",Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,155,24

The SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as a prelude to viral entry into the cell. Using a naive llama single-domain antibody library and PCR-based maturation, we have produced two closely related nanobodies, H11-D4 and H11-H4, that bind RBD (KD of 39 and 12 nM, respectively) and block its interaction with ACE2. Single-particle cryo-EM revealed that both nanobodies bind to all three RBDs in the spike trimer. Crystal structures of each nanobody-RBD complex revealed how both nanobodies recognize the same epitope, which partly overlaps with the ACE2 binding surface, explaining the blocking of the RBD-ACE2 interaction.

Laparoscopic-assisted endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (LA-ERCP) can overcome those anatomical hurdles, allowing access to the papilla. Our aims were to analyze our 12-year institutional outcomes and determine the learning curve for LA-ERCP. METHODS A retrospective review of cases between 2007 and 2019 at a high-volume pancreatobiliary unit was performed. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of specific outcomes. To identify the learning curve, CUSUM analyses and innovative methods for standardizing the surgeon's timelines were performed. RESULTS 31 patients underwent LA-ERCP (median age 60, 81% females) by 17 surgeons and 10 gastroenterologists. Cannulation of the papilla was achieved in all cases. Indications were choledocholithiasis (78%), Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction/Papillary stenosis (18%), management of bile leak (2%) and stenting/biopsy of malignant strictures (2%). Median total, surgical and ERCP times were 180, 128 and 48 min, respectively, and 47% underwent concomitant cholecystectomy. Surgical site infection developed in 9.2% and post-ERCP pancreatitis in 3.8%. Logistic regression revealed multiple abdominal operations and magnitude of BMI decrease (between RYGB and LA-ERCP) to be predictive of conversion to open approach. CUSUM analysis of operative time demonstrated a learning curve at case 27 for the surgical team and case 9 for the gastroenterology team. On binary cut analysis, 3-5 cases per surgeon were needed to optimize operative metrics. CONCLUSION LA-ERCP is associated with high success rates and low adverse events. We identify outcome benchmarks and a learning curve for new adopters of this increasingly performed procedure.","AlMasri, Samer; Zenati, Mazen S; Papachristou, Georgios I; Slivka, Adam; Sanders, Michael; Chennat, Jennifer; Rabinowitz, Mordechai; Khalid, Asif; Gelrud, Andres; Nasr, John; Sarkaria, Savreet; Das, Rohit; Lee, Kenneth K; Schraut, Wolfgang; Hughes, Steve J; Moser, A James; Paniccia, Alessandro; Hogg, Melissa E; Zeh, Herbert J; Zureikat, Amer H",Surgical endoscopy,155,11

However, most studies to date have not examined mental health symptoms between individuals with insomnia, either pre-existing or developing post-pandemic, compared to good sleepers. This study examined differences in stress, anxiety, and depression between individuals with pre-existing insomnia symptoms, post-pandemic insomnia symptoms and no insomnia symptoms, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was completed by 2724 participants from 67 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Perceived stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms were compared between individuals with post-pandemic insomnia symptoms (n=1007), pre-existing insomnia symptoms (n=804), and no insomnia symptoms (n=913). RESULTS Post-pandemic insomnia symptoms were associated with higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression than pre-existing or no insomnia symptoms (p's<.001). Pre-existing insomnia symptoms were also associated with higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression than no insomnia symptoms (p's<.001). Individuals who met likely criteria for Acute Insomnia also reported higher stress, anxiety and depression than those with Insomnia Disorder (p's<.001). Across all groups, individuals reporting a previous mental health diagnosis had worse stress, anxiety and depression than those without a previous mental health diagnosis (p's<.001). Lastly, individuals from South Africa reported higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression than other countries (p's<.01). CONCLUSIONS Internationally, individuals with pre-existing and post-pandemic insomnia symptoms may be more susceptible to stress, anxiety, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, it is not uncommon for patients undergoing LSG at our center to report symptoms suggestive of dumping syndrome. OBJECTIVE To assess the prevalence of symptoms of dumping syndrome after LSG compared with LRYGB. SETTING A single surgical group at a high-volume (700 cases per year) Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery Center of Excellence. METHODS One thousand four hundred seventy-one LRYGB (366) and LSG (1105) patients received a questionnaire to assess symptoms of dumping syndrome, utilizing a modified version of the Sigstad scoring system. Dumping syndrome was considered to be present when the questionnaire score exceeded a threshold value. RESULTS A total of 360 responses were received (249 LSG, 111 LRYGB). 26.5% (66) LSG and 41.4% (46) LRYGB exceeded the threshold for dumping syndrome (p < 0.01). 84.8% (56) LSG and 84.7% (39) LRYGB reported early dumping syndrome (p > 0.05). Thirty-six percent (24) LSG and 28% (13) LRYGB reported late dumping syndrome (p > 0.05). Twenty-seven percent (62) LSG and 44.4% (44) LRYGB reported at least one symptom of dumping syndrome with sweets (p < 0.05). 34.3% (85) LSG and 35.5% (39) LRYGB reported symptoms when drinking with or within 30 min of a meal (p > 0.05). 14.5% (36) LSG and 17.3% (19) LRYGB reported symptoms after alcohol consumption (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION Dumping syndrome after LSG is prevalent but has not been widely reported. This finding may impact clinicians and patients in their choice of procedure and has relevance in post-operative education and care.","Ahmad, Arif; Kornrich, Daphne Baldwin; Krasner, Helaine; Eckardt, Sarah; Ahmad, Zoha; Braslow, AnnaMarie; Broggelwirth, Barbara",Obesity surgery,155,14

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the robot for resection of these tumors. METHODS We performed a retrospective review of the evolution and outcomes of our surgical technique for inferior or posterior mediastinal pathology. RESULTS During a 30-month period, 153 patients underwent robotic surgery for pathology in the mediastinum, located in the inferior or posterior mediastinum in 75 of these patients. The most common indications for surgery were posterior mediastinal mass or lymph node in 41 patients, esophageal or bronchogenic cysts in 11 patients, esophageal leiomyoma in 7 patients, and diaphragmatic elevation in 7 patients. The median tumor size was 4.4 cm, and the median length of stay was 1 day. One patient was converted to thoracotomy, but no patients were converted for bleeding. Morbidity occurred in 9 patients (12%), major in 1 patient (a delayed esophageal leak after epiphrenic diverticulectomy). There was no mortality. Technical improvements included using robotic arm 3 posteriorly for retraction, side-docking, or coming over the back of the patient for tumors inferior to the inferior pulmonary vein and for diaphragmatic plication and using the lateral decubitus position for extraction of tumors larger than 3 cm via an access port over the tenth rib above the diaphragmatic fibers. CONCLUSIONS The robot affords safe access using a completely portal approach for resection of and surgical intervention for inferior and posterior chest pathology and for anterior tumors. Specific techniques can be used to improve the operation.","Cerfolio, Robert James; Bryant, Ayesha S; Minnich, Douglas J",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,155,31

DESIGN Cross-sectional surveys using a web-based questionnaire. Participants were recruited via snowball techniques. SETTING São Paulo state, the urban epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil at the time of the study. PARTICIPANTS 2.203 clicks to the survey link and 1.223 surveys completed (55.5% response rate). However, only 1118 surveys were considered after the exclusion criteria (>18 years-old and consent). MEASURES Demographics, educational status, COVID-19-related symptoms (headache, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, fever, asthenia, diarrhea, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, anosmia, and ageusia), and face mask use. ANALYSIS Self-reports of COVID-19 symptoms were categorized as dichotomous variables (Cohen's h = 0.94). Pearson Chi-square test evaluated differences between T1 and T2 and logistic multiple regression analyzed odds-ratio for the presence of symptoms and independent variables. RESULTS Face mask use increased from 43.60% in T1 to 90.52% in T2 (P < .0001) as the pandemic went on. Health literacy also changed within 2 weeks and people started to assume everybody should use face masks (62.93% in T1 vs 94.12% in T2; P < .0001; ES = 0.29) during outside activities (43.60% in T1 vs 90.52% in T2; P < .0001; ES = 0.39). Self-reports of face mask use were associated with fewer self-reports of COVID-19 symptoms (OR = 0.65, P = .01, 95% CI 0.48; 0.88). CONCLUSION Face mask use was already high among educated Brazilians before the formal recommendation by the authorities. This may have contributed to fewer self-reports of COVID-19-related symptoms.","Fernandes, Danilo Euclides; Riguetti, Michelle T P; Mastroianni Kirsztajn, Gianna",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,155,1

With no FDA approved therapeutics available to treat RVFV infection, understanding the interactions between the virus and the infected host is crucial to developing novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we investigated the requirement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) for the establishment of a productive RVFV infection. It was previously shown that the UPS plays a central role in RVFV multiplication involving degradation of PKR and p62 subunit of TFIIH. Using the FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib, we observed robust inhibition of intracellular and extracellular viral loads. Bortezomib treatment did not affect the nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of the non-structural S-segment protein (NSs); however, the ability of NSs to form nuclear filaments was abolished as a result of Bortezomib treatment. In silico ubiquitination prediction analysis predicted that known NSs interactors (SAP30, YY1, and mSin3A) have multiple putative ubiquitination sites, while NSs itself was not predicted to be ubiquitinated. Immunoprecipitation studies indicated a decrease in interaction between SAP30 - NSs, and mSin3A - NSs in the context of Bortezomib treatment. This decrease in association between SAP30 - NSs also correlated with a decrease in the ubiquitination status of SAP30 with Bortezomib treatment. Bortezomib treatment, however, resulted in increased ubiquitination of mSin3A, suggesting that Bortezomib dynamically affects the ubiquitination status of host proteins that interact with NSs. Finally, we observed that expression of interferon beta (IFN-β) was increased in Bortezomib treated cells which indicated that the cellular antiviral mechanism was revived as a result of treatment and may contribute to control of viral multiplication.","Keck, Forrest; Amaya, Moushimi; Kehn-Hall, Kylene; Roberts, Brian; Bailey, Charles; Narayanan, Aarthi",Antiviral research,155,1

Due to the high mental, physical, and emotional demands of the pediatric hematology/oncology profession, workplace supports should be in place to address the needs of the staff. A nurse-led support program is one strategy to enhance staff well-being. Methods: The Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplant Advancing Resiliency Team (HART) is a nurse-led peer-to-peer on-site support program for multidisciplinary staff caring for hematology/oncology patients. HART coaches, working 8-hour shifts, covering both day and night shift hours, are present 3 days a week on the unit. HART offers a confidential space for one on one or group interactions, educational sessions, assistance with work related, patient-care based, or personal concerns, and various forms of integrative therapies. Results: There have been over 1,100 coach consults and 98 HART shifts worked. The most commonly reported changes since HART began include staff feeling more supported by leadership and staff making time for breaks during the work shift. A 25.6% increase in staff reporting to be extremely satisfied with unit support was found. Discussion: Cultivating a culture of staff support is important. Due to COVID-19, physical HART coach presence was put on hold for 4 weeks and virtual interventions were trialed. Since its return, coach consult numbers have been steadily rising. Having a support program led by coaches with direct experience understanding the emotional toll of caring for the pediatric hematology/oncology patient population was found to be well utilized, feasible through donor funding, and measurable via staff report.","Schuster, Michelle A",Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,155,1

METHODS The mixed methods design included a subset of cancer patients who responded to a cross-sectional survey in May 2020. Data were collected through telephone interviews. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer (NCCN DT), and Connor-Davidson-Resilience Scale (CD-RISC2) were used to measure distress and resilience. Data were analysed by thematic analysis and descriptive statistics. RESULTS Forty patients with lung, breast, colorectal and skin (melanoma) cancer were included; 65% were women. Mean age was 62.2 years (standard deviation [SD], 13.2). Most patients had curable disease (65%); 50% were in treatment and 50% in post-treatment follow up. The interviews revealed four themes: 1) the cost of living with cancer during COVID-19, 2) changes in cancer care delivery, 3) particularly vulnerable, and 4) importance of family support. Mean NCCN DT score was 2.3 (SD, 2.6) while the mean CD-RISC2 score was 7.25 (SD, 1.1). CONCLUSION Despite drastic changes in daily life imposed by COVID-19 restrictions, Danish cancer patients had remarkably low levels of distress and high levels of resilience. Patients in active treatment, with comorbidities or elderly felt vulnerable. Family support was invaluable in critical times.","Dieperink, Karin Brochstedt; Ikander, Tine; Appiah, Sabina; Tolstrup, Lærke Kjær",European journal of oncology nursing : the official journal of European Oncology Nursing Society,155,7

However, in the last months an increasing number of Italian pediatricians has reported the occurrence of erythema pernio-like in children following a flu-like syndrome, after the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVE To report cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 4 adolescents. METHODS Observational study reporting 4 adolescents with skin lesions, 2 weeks after the occurrence of a flu-like syndrome. RESULTS Fourteen days after a flu-like syndrome, adolescents exhibited skin lesions to toes and feet. These lesions were rounded, with blurred limits, with a 5-15 mm diameter, red-violaceous-bluish colored, sometimes resulting in bullous lesions in correspondence of the central or apical portion, which tended to be covered with blackish crusts after evolution. Lesions were also accompanied by pain of variable intensity and evolved within two or three weeks to self-resolution without particular sequelae. In two patients, pharyngeal and nasal swabs were negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, at the presentation of skin lesions. After 2 months from clinical manifestations, patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. CONCLUSIONS In pediatric and adolescent population, the occurrence of an erythema pernio-like after a flu-like syndrome could be associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Promenzio, Luigi; Arcangeli, Fabio; Cortis, Elisabetta; Sama, Elisa; Longhini, Federico",Reviews on recent clinical trials,155,19

The relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) thresholds chosen to identify ischemic core influence the accuracy of prediction. We aimed to analyze the accuracy of various rCBV and rCBF thresholds for predicting the 27-hour infarct volume using RAPID automated analysis software from the SWIFT PRIME trial (Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment) data. METHODS Patients from the SWIFT PRIME study who achieved complete reperfusion based on time until the residue function reached its peak >6 s perfusion maps obtained at 27 hours were included. Patients from both the intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator only and endovascular groups were included in analysis. Final infarct volume was determined on magnetic resonance imaging (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images) or computed tomography scans obtained 27 hours after symptom onset. The predicted ischemic core volumes on rCBV and rCBF maps using thresholds ranging between 0.2 and 0.8 were compared with the actual infarct volume to determine the most accurate thresholds. RESULTS Among the 47 subjects, the following baseline computed tomography perfusion thresholds most accurately predicted the actual 27-hour infarct volume: rCBV=0.32, median absolute error (MAE)=9 mL; rCBV=0.34, MAE=9 mL; rCBF=0.30, MAE=8.8 mL; rCBF=0.32, MAE=7 mL; and rCBF=0.34, MAE=7.3. CONCLUSIONS Brain regions with rCBF 0.30 to 0.34 or rCBV 0.32 to 0.34 thresholds provided the most accurate prediction of infarct volume in patients who achieved complete reperfusion with MAEs of ≤9 mL.

These agents possess characteristics that have afforded various anesthetics to be delivered and produce relatively safe and effective outcomes. However, each agent has certain drawbacks in clinical practice. Remimazolam, a novel benzodiazepine created out of so-called soft drug development, is an ultrashort-acting intravenous sedative-hypnotic currently being investigated in clinical trials. In this review, we evaluate the recent literature on the use of remimazolam in clinical practice as compared with current sedative agents, and we describe its potential roles for use in sedation. A literature search of the Medline database (2012-May 2016) was performed. Additional references were identified from a review of literature citations, manufacturer reports, and professional meeting abstracts. All premarket studies involving remimazolam as the primary study drug were evaluated. Literature describing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of remimazolam, propofol, and midazolam was also included. Phase I and II studies in the United States have shown remimazolam to be a safe and effective option for procedural sedation. Unlike midazolam and propofol, remimazolam undergoes organ-independent metabolism to an inactive metabolite. Because remimazolam follows first-order pharmacokinetics, prolonged infusions or higher doses are unlikely to result in accumulation and extended effect, making it favorable for use as an intravenous anesthetic and for sedation in the intensive care unit. It is expected that phase III trials will further describe the niche that remimazolam may be able to occupy in clinical practice. Postmarket cost-benefit analyses will need to be performed.","Wesolowski, Alexandra M; Zaccagnino, Michael P; Malapero, Raymond J; Kaye, Alan D; Urman, Richard D",Pharmacotherapy,155,7

Host foreign body reaction, local inflammation, and wound healing are principally controlled by monocytes/macrophages (M/MØs). Exaggerated activation of M/MØs may deleteriously influence mesh integration and remodeling. We hypothesized that common porcine meshes induce the differential activation of M/MØs in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS Samples of four acellular porcine-derived meshes, CollaMend (CM; C.R. Bard/Davol), Permacol (PC; TSL/Covidien), Strattice (ST; LifeCell), and Surgisis (SS; Cook Biotech), were exposed to mononuclear cells derived from the peripheral blood of six healthy subjects. Following a 7-day incubation period, supernatants were assayed for interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) using a multiplex bead-based immunoassay system. The four groups were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student's t-test. RESULTS Each mesh type induced differential mononuclear cell activation in vitro. The mean IL-1beta expressions for CM (7,195 pg/ml) and PC (4,215 pg/ml) were significantly higher compared to ST and SS (123 and 998 pg/ml, respectively; P < 0.05). Similar trends were also seen for IL-6 (range 445-70,729 pg/ml), IL-8 (range 11,640-1,045,938 pg/ml), and VEGF (range 686-7,133 pg/ml). CONCLUSION For the first time, we demonstrated that porcine meshes induce M/MØ activation in vitro. CM and PC (chemically crosslinked dermis) induced significantly higher cytokine expression compared to ST (non-crosslinked dermis) and SS (small intestine submucosa). These differences are likely related to proprietary processing methods and/or the extent of collagen crosslinking. Further understanding of immunologic effects of porcine-derived biologic meshes will not only allow for a comparison between existing products, but it may also lead to mesh modifications and improvement of their clinical performance.","Orenstein, S B; Qiao, Y; Klueh, U; Kreutzer, D L; Novitsky, Y W",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,155,14

Numerous clinical and radiological factors are associated with expansion. In a bid to better select patients at increased risk of expanding, these factors have been collated together into clinical scores. Several clinical scores have been developed, but comparisons of diagnostic potential between these scores are limited and the frequency of use in clinical trial enrolment is unknown. OBJECTIVE To perform a scoping review of haematoma expansion scores and explore numerous factors such as the methodology of development and diagnostic capabilities. METHODS AND ANALYSIS MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL and ClinicalTrials.gov will be searched with assistance from an experienced information specialist. Eligible studies will involve adults presenting with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage who received baseline assessments, follow-up imaging and risk stratification through a haematoma expansion score. Reviewers will independently extract data from the included studies and will collect data on patient demographics and medical history, details on score development, diagnostic capabilities and usage proportions. Analysis of extracted data will focus on comparing the predictive capability of each score and similarities/differences in score development. The exact analysis technique will be dictated on the type of data extracted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Formal ethics is not required as primary data will not be collected.

Though multiple scales are currently being used to measure this increasingly important issue, syntheses of the psychometric properties of these scales are unavailable. This means that existing estimates of ageism prevalence may not be accurate. We conducted a systematic review aimed at identifying available ageism scales and evaluating their scope and psychometric properties. A comprehensive search strategy was used across fourteen different databases, including PubMed and CINAHL. Independent reviewers extracted data and appraised risk of bias following the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) guidelines. Of the 29,664 records identified, 106 studies, assessing 11 explicit scales of ageism, were eligible for inclusion. Only one scale, the 'Expectations Regarding Aging' met minimum requirements for psychometric validation (i.e., adequate content validity, structural validity and internal consistency). Still, this scale only assesses the 'stereotype' dimension of ageism, thus failing to evaluate the other two ageism dimensions (prejudice and discrimination). This paper highlights the need to develop and validate a scale that accounts for the multidimensional nature of ageism. Having a scale that can accurately measure ageism prevalence is key in a time of increasing and rapid population ageing, where the magnitude of this phenomenon may be increasing.","Ayalon, Liat; Dolberg, Pnina; Mikulionienė, Sarmitė; Perek-Białas, Jolanta; Rapolienė, Gražina; Stypinska, Justyna; Willińska, Monika; de la Fuente-Núñez, Vânia",Ageing research reviews,155,33

This study attempted to obtain individual patient data from each of the 13 studies published since 1985 to better define groups of patients that might benefit from surgery. METHODS Authors of identified published articles were approached by mail, e-mail, and at conferences and invited to take part in the study. Data were obtained from 8 studies (2186 cases). Individual patient data included patient's age, Glasgow Coma Score at presentation, volume and site of hematoma, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage, method of evacuation, time to randomization, and outcome. RESULTS Meta-analysis indicated that there was improved outcome with surgery if randomization was [corrected] undertaken within 8 hours of ictus (P=0.003), or the volume of the hematoma was 20 to 50 mL (P=0.004), or the Glasgow Coma Score was between 9 and 12 (P=0.0009), or the patient was aged between 50 and 69 years (P=0.01). In addition, there was some evidence that more superficial hematomas with no intraventricular hemorrhage might also benefit (P=0.09).

METHODS Hospital database was screened for patients who underwent single-stage endovascular treatment between February 2008 and June 2013 and seven patients were identified. The procedures included unilateral carotid artery stenting (CAS) (n=4), bilateral CAS (n=2), and proximal left subclavian artery stenting (n=1) along with ipsilateral intracranial aneurysm treatment (n=7). The mean internal carotid artery stenosis was 81.6% (range, 70%-95%), and the subclavian artery stenosis was 90%. All aneurysms were unruptured. The mean aneurysm diameter was 7.7 mm (range, 5-13 mm). The aneurysms were ipsilateral to the internal carotid artery stenosis (internal carotid artery aneurysm) in five patients, and in the anterior communicating artery in one patient. The patient with subclavian artery stenosis had a fenestration aneurysm in the proximal basilar artery. Stenting of the extracranial large vessel stenosis was performed before aneurysm treatment in all patients. In two patients who underwent bilateral CAS, the contralateral carotid artery stenosis, which had no aneurysm distally, was treated initially. RESULTS There were no procedure-related complications or technical failure. The mean clinical follow-up period was 18 months (range, 9-34 months). One patient who underwent unilateral CAS experienced contralateral transient ischemic attack during the clinical follow-up. There was no restenosis on six-month follow-up angiograms, and all aneurysms were adequately occluded. CONCLUSION A single-stage procedure appears to be feasible for treatment of patients with severe extracranial large vessel stenosis and concomitant ipsilateral intracranial aneurysm.","Kaçar, Emre; Nas, Ömer Fatih; Erdoğan, Cüneyt; Hakyemez, Bahattin",Diagnostic and interventional radiology,155,1

Testicular Inflammatory Processes in Pediatric Patients.",13.3659115,6.90599,2016,"OBJECTIVE The Enterprise stent is the first closed-cell stent designed to treat wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. Advantages of the design can include improvement in keeping coils within an aneurysm and the ability of the stent to be recaptured. We compared the technical and clinical complications of the Enterprise stent with the open-cell Neuroform stent, its primary alternative. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Patients undergoing Enterprise and Neuroform stent-assisted aneurysm coiling were enrolled in prospective registries starting in March 2007 and February 2003, respectively. All consecutive patients through December 2011 were included. Deployment success and difficulty, stent movement and misplacement, and procedural complications were compared. RESULTS Enterprise deployment success was high (108 of 115 attempts, 93.9%) with 102 aneurysms receiving a stent compared with Neuroform (173 of 214 attempts, 80.8%, p = 0.001) with 163 aneurysms. Enterprise was easier to deploy (1.7% vs 15.9% difficult deployment, p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in the rates of stent movement, misplacement, or symptomatic hemorrhage. Symptomatic thromboembolic events, however, were more frequent with the Enterprise stent (8.7% vs 1.4%, p = 0.0021). The Enterprise stent enabled treatment of 10 additional aneurysms that could not be treated with Neuroform and had a higher rate of immediate aneurysm occlusion (87.3% vs 73.0%, p = 0.0058). CONCLUSION Enterprise was easier to deploy and enabled treatment of additional aneurysms; however, there were more thromboembolic complications. On the basis of these findings, we prefer to use the Neuroform stent first and rely on the Enterprise stent as an easy-to-deliver backup for stent-assisted coiling.","Kadkhodayan, Yasha; Rhodes, Nicholas; Blackburn, Spiros; Derdeyn, Colin P; Cross, DeWitte T; Moran, Christopher J",AJR.

We aim to present the clinical and imaging findings in adolescents with pulmonary symptoms from suspected EVALI. METHODS Chest radiographs and CTs of adolescents (< 19 years) with acute pulmonary symptoms and history of vaping were reviewed by two radiologists in consensus. Clinical presentation and laboratory data were derived from the electronic medical records including pulmonary function tests (PFTs). RESULTS Eleven patients were identified (9 male, mean 16.6 years). The most common presentation was progressive, subacute respiratory distress with abdominal pain. All but one of the patients tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol. Chest radiograph features were notable for interstitial pattern of opacities (91%) and basilar abnormalities (82%). CT features were notable for ground-glass opacities (89%), interstitial opacities (78%), and subpleural sparing (67%). Eight patients underwent PFTs. Six had diffusing capacity measurement, which demonstrated impaired diffusion in 3 (50%). All patients received supportive treatment with supplemental oxygen and corticosteroids. CONCLUSION Adolescents with suspected EVALI commonly present with subacute respiratory distress with abdominal pain. Imaging findings include ground-glass opacities, subpleural sparing, and basilar opacities, most consistent with organizing pneumonia or hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Recognition of the common imaging findings may have significant patient management implications, especially if the diagnosis is not suspected clinically. The lung function effects of vaping are consistent with mildly reduced airflow, which improves on follow-up testing, and reduced diffusion capacity, which, concerningly, does not improve.","Chidambaram, Ambika G; Dennis, Rebecca A; Biko, David M; Hook, Marcus; Allen, Julian; Rapp, Jordan B",Emergency radiology,155,1

Out of necessity, virtual care became a preferred and default modality of extending primary care services to health care consumers. Although telemedicine is not a new concept and had been used in many organizations and health systems, the COVID-19 pandemic scaled up its use in a variety of health care settings. Telehealth's use in primary care was particularly important because of the need to maintain continuity of care for successful coordination of chronic disease management. This article examines the benefits of telehealth, including continuity of care, convenience of access to care, screening and triaging, and social distancing and disease prevention. The utilization of telehealth and financial implications are discussed, including reimbursement and cost-effectiveness. Barriers and challenges are addressed, including methods for successful implementation of nurse practitioner (NP) in primary care practices as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The leadership role of the NP in telehealth is discussed and implementation guidance is provided.","Dhaliwal, Jaspreet K; Hall, Tara D; LaRue, Julie L; Maynard, Susan E; Pierre, Peterson E; Bransby, Kristen A",Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,155,1

This work aims at evaluating the impact of a reduction in chronic use of benzodiazepine on the future burden of dementia in France. Using estimations of dementia incidence and of benzodiazepine use and nation-wide projections of mortality and population sizes, a Monte Carlo approach based on an illness-death model provided projections of several indicators of dementia burden. With no change in benzodiazepine consumption, the prevalence of dementia between age 65 and 99 in France in 2040 was estimated at 2.16 millions (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93-2.38), with a life expectancy without dementia at 65 years equal to 25.0 years (24.7-25.3) for women and 23.8 years (23.5-24.2) for men. Assuming a disappearance of chronic use of benzodiazepine in 2020, the prevalence would be reduced by about 6.6% in 2040 and the life expectancy without dementia would increase by 0.99 (0.93-1.06) year among women and 0.56 (0.50-0.62) among men. To conclude, a modest but significant reduction in future dementia burden could be obtained by applying current recommendation for duration of benzodiazepine use.","Jacqmin-Gadda, Hélène; Guillet, Florian; Mathieu, Clément; Helmer, Catherine; Pariente, Antoine; Joly, Pierre",Scientific reports,155,31

STUDY DESIGNS 554 women respondents age 18 to 49 and reside in the United States were recruited using social media between May 16, 2020 and June 16, 2020. Logistic regression models assessed predictors of reporting pandemic-related changes in economic conditions, desire for pregnancy, and contraceptive access. RESULTS Compared to White/Caucasian respondents, Hispanics/Latinx and Black/African Americans were four times more likely to experience inability to afford food, transportation, and/or housing (p<0.01) during the pandemic; Hispanics/Latinx were twice as likely to experience food insecurity (p<0.05). Inability to afford food, transportation, and/or housing was associated with drop in desire to be pregnant (p<0.01). Despite the 25% of participants who reported a drop in desire for pregnancy, one in six reported difficulty accessing contraceptives, particularly those who experienced reduced income (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS In our sample, the pandemic unevenly affected people from different socioeconomic groups. Many simultaneously experienced reduced income, difficulties in accessing contraception, and a greater desire to avoid a pregnancy. This combination of factors increases the chance that people will experience unintended pregnancies. IMPLICATIONS The pandemic caused economic hardship and an increased desire to postpone or prevent pregnancy at the same time that it created new barriers to contraceptive services. This patten may lead to a potential net effect of an increase in unintended pregnancy, particularly among people who had difficulty affording food, transportation, and/or housing during the pandemic.","Lin, Tracy Kuo; Law, Rachel; Beaman, Jessica; Foster, Diana Greene",Contraception,155,1

MoS2 flakes prepared through liquid-phase exfoliation, serves as platform for thiolated DNA probe immobilization, while thionine functionalized carbon nanodots (Thi-CNDs) are used as electrochemical indicator of the hybridization event. Spectroscopic and electrochemical studies confirmed the interaction of Thi-CNDs with DNA. As an illustration of the pathogen biosensor functioning, DNA sequences from InIA gen of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria and open reading frame sequence (ORF1ab) of SARS-CoV-2 virus were detected and quantified with a detection limit of 67.0 fM and 1.01 pM, respectively. Given the paradigmatic selectivity of the DNA hybridization, this approach allows pathogen detection in the presence of other pathogens, demonstrated by the detection of Listeria monocytogenes in presence of Escherichia coli. We note that this design is in principle amenable to any pathogen for which the DNA has been sequenced, including other viruses and bacteria. As example of the application of the method in real samples it has been used to directly detect Listeria monocytogenes in cultures without any DNA Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification process.","Martínez-Periñán, Emiliano; García-Mendiola, Tania; Enebral-Romero, Estefanía; Del Caño, Rafael; Vera-Hidalgo, Mariano; Vázquez Sulleiro, Manuel; Navío, Cristina; Pariente, Félix; Pérez, Emilio M; Lorenzo, Encarnación",Biosensors & bioelectronics,155,1

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is considered as the revisional procedure of choice. However, revisional bariatric surgery is associated with relatively higher rates of complications. The aim of the current study is to analyse our single-centre experience with patients requiring revisional RYGB following primary VBG. METHODS Retrospective review of the prospectively collected database identified 153 patients who underwent RYGB as a revisional procedure after VBG from Feb 2004-Feb 2011. Early and late complications, weight data and resolution of symptoms related to gastric outlet obstruction were analysed. RESULTS One hundred twenty-three females and 30 males underwent revisional RYGB post VBG. Mean age was 44.4 (15-74) years with a mean pre-operative body mass index (BMI) of 34.2 (23.5-65.5) kg/m(2). Mean hospital stay was 4.3 days. Early complication rate was 3.9 % with a 30-day re-operation rate of 1.3 %. Mortality and leak rate were zero. After a mean follow-up of 48 months, the mean BMI decreased significantly to 28.8 kg/m(2) and a complete resolution of the obstructive symptoms was achieved in nearly all patients. Late complications developed in 11 (7.7 %) of the patients of which seven (4.9 %) required surgery. CONCLUSIONS Revisional RYGB following VBG is technically challenging but safe with low rates of morbidity and mortality, comparable to primary RYGB. It produces a significant reduction in body weight and in symptoms resolution. We recommend RYGB as the procedure of choice in patients requiring revisional surgery following VBG.","Vasas, Peter; Dillemans, Bruno; Van Cauwenberge, Sebastiaan; De Visschere, Marieke; Vercauteren, Charlotte",Obesity surgery,155,1

A better knowledge of the living conditions during the first lockdown is necessary to prevent the risk of poor mental health (PMH) in this population. OBJECTIVE The present study aimed to compare the mental health of caregivers of PWD living at home or in nursing-homes and to identify specific factors influencing their mental health. METHODS We conducted an anonymous cross-sectional online survey in France from March 17 to May 11, 2020. Three hundred and eighty-nine caregivers accompanying a PWD living at home (HC) and 159 accompanying a PWD living in a nursing home (NHC) participated in the study. Caregivers' mental health including anxiety, depression, stress, and burden was assessed with self-reported standardized scales. RESULTS Half of the caregivers exhibited PMH, including depression, anxiety, or self-reported stress. Similar PMH rates were provided whatever the PWD place of residence. Regarding HC, our results also highlighted a number of risk factors for PMH, including the fact that caregiver live with PWD, to give increased support to PWD, and to feel more isolated for managing PWD since lockdown. CONCLUSION PMH was observed for caregivers of PWD during lockdown, whatever PWD living place, suggesting that concern for PWD may explain more of caregiver distress than increased material tasks. In the future, it will be necessary to pay attention to caregivers after the crisis by estimating the longer-term impact on their mental health.","Borg, Céline; Rouch, Isabelle; Pongan, Elodie; Getenet, Jean Claude; Bachelet, Romain; Herrmann, Mathieu; Bohec, Anne-Lise; Laurent, Bernard; Rey, Romain; Dorey, Jean-Michel",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,155,33

We compared the effectiveness and safety of cold infusions (CI) and nasopharyngeal cooling (NPC) for cooling induction in stroke patients. METHODS A prospective, open-label, randomised (1:1), single-centre pilot trial with partially blinded safety endpoint assessment was conducted at the neurointensive care unit of Heidelberg University. Intubated stroke patients with an indication for therapeutic cooling and an intracranial pressure (ICP)/temperature brain probe were randomly assigned to CI (4°C, 2L at 4L/h) or NPC (60L/min for 1 h). Previous data suggested a maximum decrease of tympanic temperature for CI (2.1L within 35 min) after 52 min. Therefore the study period was 1 hour (15 min subperiods I-IV). The brain temperature course was the primary endpoint. Secondary measures included continuous monitoring of neurovital parameters and extracerebral temperatures. Statistical analysis based on repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS Of 221 patients screened, 20 were randomized within 5 months. Infusion time of 2L CI was 33 ± 4 min in 10 patients and 10 patients received NPC for 60 min. During active treatment (first 30 min), brain temperature decreased faster with CI than during NPC (I: -0.31 ± 0.2 versus -0.12 ± 0.1°C, P = 0.008; II: -1.0 ± 0.3 versus -0.49 ± 0.3°C, P = 0.001). In the CI-group, after the infusion was finished, the intervention no longer decreased brain temperature, which increased after 3.5 ± 3.3 min. Oesophageal temperature correlated best with brain temperature during CI and NPC. Tympanic temperature reacted similarly to relative changes of brain temperature during CI, but absolute values slightly differed. CI provoked three severe adverse events during subperiods II-IV (two systolic arterial pressure (SAP), one shivering) compared with four in the NPC-group, all during subperiod I (three SAP, one ICP). Classified as possibly intervention-related, two cases of ventilator failure occurred during NPC. CONCLUSIONS In intubated stroke patients, brain cooling is faster during CI than during NPC. Importantly, contrary to previous expectations, brain cooling stopped soon after CI cessation. Oesophageal but neither bladder nor rectal temperature is suited as surrogate for brain temperature during CI and NPC. Several severe adverse events in CI and in NPC demand further studying of safety. TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01573117.

Unlike most eukaryotes, gene expression in kinetoplastids is predominately regulated post-transcriptionally. Consequently, RNA-binding proteins and mRNA-encoded sequence elements serve as primary determinants of gene regulation in these organisms; however, few have defined roles in specific stress-response pathways. Leishmania species cannot synthesize purines de novo and must scavenge these essential nutrients from the host. Leishmania have evolved a robust stress response to withstand sustained periods of purine scarcity during their lifecycles. The purine nucleobase transporter, LdNT3, is among the most substantially upregulated proteins in purine-starved Leishmania donovani parasites. Here, we report that the post-translational stability of the LdNT3 protein is unchanged in response to purine starvation. Instead, LdNT3 upregulation is primarily mediated by a 33-nucleotide-long sequence in the LdNT3 mRNA 3'-UTR that is predicted to adopt a stem-loop structure. Although this sequence is highly conserved within the mRNAs of orthologous transporters in multiple kinetoplastid species, putative stem-loops from L. donovani and Trypanosoma brucei nucleobase transporter mRNAs were not functionally interchangeable for purine-responsive regulation. Through mutational analysis of the element, we demonstrate that species specificity is attributable to just three variant bases within the predicted loop. Finally, we provide evidence that the abundance of the trans-acting factor that binds the LdNT3 stem-loop in vivo is substantially higher than required for regulation of LdNT3 alone, implying a potential role in regulating other purine-responsive genes.","Licon, M Haley; Yates, Phillip A",The Journal of biological chemistry,155,16

To resolve this inconsistency, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to precisely examine the association between BMI and UTI. METHODS This meta-analysis was performed based on the PRISMA recommendations. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar databases were searched for all published observational studies that reported the risk of UTI based on BMI categories up to March 2020. RESULTS Fourteen (n = 14) articles comprising 19 studies in different populations met our inclusion criteria. The overall analysis showed a significant increased risk of UTI in subjects affected by obesity vs. individuals without obesity (RR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.28 - 1.63; I2 = 94%), and a non-significant increased risk of UTI in subjects who were overweight (RR = 1.03; 95% CI: 0.98 - 1.10; I2 = 49.6%) and underweight (RR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.81 - 21; I2 = 0.0%) when compared to subjects who had normal weight. In the stratified analysis, we showed that obesity increased the risk of UTI in females (RR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.38 - 1.93) and in subjects below 60 years old (RR = 1.53; 95% CI: 1.33 - 1.75). CONCLUSION This systematic review and meta-analysis recognized a significant relationship between BMI and incidence of UTI in obese vs. non-obese subjects, as well as in females and in individuals below 60 years old.","Alhabeeb, Habeeb; Baradwan, Saeed; Kord-Varkaneh, Hamed; Tan, Shing Cheng; Low, Teck Yew; Alomar, Osama; Salem, Hany; Al-Badawi, Ismail Abdulrahman; Abu-Zaid, Ahmed",Eating and weight disorders : EWD,155,1

This systematic review aimed to summarize and meta-analyze the salient features and prognosis of SARS-CoV-2-associated GBS. METHODS We searched the PubMed (Medline), Web of Science and Cochrane databases for articles published between January 1st and August 5th 2020 using SARS-CoV-2 and GBS-related keywords. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, antecedent symptoms, clinical, serological and electrophysiological features, and hospital outcomes were recorded. RESULTS We included 45 articles from 16 countries reporting 61 patients with SARS-CoV-2-associated GBS. Most (97.7%) articles were from high- and upper-middle-income countries. Forty-two (68.9%) of the patients were male; median (interquartile range) age was 57 (49-70) years. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in 90.2% of patients. One report of SARS-CoV-2-associated familial GBS was found which affected a father and daughter of a family. Albuminocytological dissociation in cerebrospinal fluid was found in 80.8% of patients. The majority of patients (75.5%) had a demyelinating subtype of GBS. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasmapheresis were given to 92.7% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. Around two-thirds (65.3%) of patients had a good outcome (GBS-disability score ≤ 2) on discharge from hospital. Two patients died in hospital. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2-associated GBS mostly resembles the classical presentations of GBS that respond to standard treatments. Extensive surveillance is required in low- and lower-middle-income countries to identify and report similar cases/series. Further large-scale case-control studies are warranted to strengthen the current evidence. This article is protected by copyright.

Most laparoscopic right colectomies are completed as a hybrid procedure with extracorporeal anastomosis. As part of a pure minimally invasive procedure, intracorporeal anastomosis (ICA) may confer additional benefits for patients. The robotic platform may shorten the learning curve for minimally invasive right colectomy with ICA. METHODS From January 2014 to May 2016, 49 patients underwent robotic-assisted right colectomy by a board-certified colorectal surgeon (S.R). Extracorporeal anastomosis (ECA) was used in the first 20 procedures, whereas ICA was used in all subsequent procedures. Outcomes recorded in a database for retrospective review included operating time (OT), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of stay (LOS), conversion rate, complications, readmissions, and mortality rate. RESULTS Comparison of average OT, EBL, and LOS between extracorporeal and intracorporeal groups demonstrated no significant differences. For all patients, average OT was 141.6 ± 25.8 (range 86-192) min, average EBL was 59.5 ± 83.3 (range 0-500) mL, and average LOS was 3.4 ± 1.19 (range 1.5-8) days. Four patients required conversion, all of which occurred in the extracorporeal group. There were no conversions after the 18th procedure. The 60-day mortality rate was 0%. There were no anastomotic leaks, ostomies created, or readmissions. As the surgeon gained experience, a statistically significant increase in lymph node sampling was observed in oncologic cases (p = .02). CONCLUSIONS The robotic platform may help more surgeons safely and efficiently transition to a purely minimally invasive procedure, enabling more patients to reap the benefits of less invasive surgery. Transitioning from ECA to ICA during robotic right colectomy resulted in no significant change in OT or LOS. A lower rate of conversion to open surgery was noted with increased experience.","Reitz, Alexandra C W; Lin, Ed; Rosen, Seth A",Surgical endoscopy,155,1

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA We constructed a canine model of anorectal transplantation, evaluated the long-term outcomes, and controlled rejection and infection in allotransplantation. METHODS In the pudendal nerve function study, 6 dogs were randomly divided into 2 groups, transection and anastomosis, and were compared with a control using anorectal manometry, electromyography, and histological examination. In the anorectal transplantation model, 4 dogs were assigned to 4 groups: autotransplant, allotransplant with immunosuppression, allotransplant without immunosuppression, and normal control. Long-term function was evaluated by defecography, videography, and histological examination. RESULTS In the pudendal nerve function study, anorectal manometry indicated that the anastomosis group recovered partial function 6 months postoperatively. Microscopically, the pudendal nerve and the sphincter muscle regenerated in the anastomosis group. Anorectal transplantation was technically successful with a 3-stage operation: colostomy preparation, anorectal transplantation, and stoma closure. The dog who underwent allotransplantation and immunosuppression had 2 episodes of mild rejection, which were reversed with methylprednisolone and tacrolimus. The dog who underwent allotransplantation without immunosuppression had a severe acute rejection that resulted in graft necrosis. Successful dogs had full defecation control at the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS We describe the critical role of the pudendal nerve in anorectal function and the first long-term success with anorectal transplantation in a canine model.

Although specialized stroke rehabilitation improves the recovery of functional abilities, accessing rehabilitation services has become increasingly challenging as the number of stroke survivors continues to increase and rehabilitation resources remain scarce. Mobile tablet-based therapies (MTBTs) may be a resource-efficient platform for providing stroke rehabilitation services. The feasibility and challenges of offering MTBTs to stroke survivors should be well understood before expensive, large-scale clinical trials are undertaken to study treatment efficacy. METHOD A systematic scoping review will be conducted to describe attempted MTBTs following stroke and the challenges encountered by survivors and study staff. Studies of interest will evaluate MTBTs offered to adult stroke patients in response to post-stroke complications or deficits. Journal databases, gray literature sources, clinical trial registries, relevant organizational websites, and reference lists of eligible studies will be searched to identify suitable studies. Study characteristics, barriers to care, methodological challenges, patient-reported outcomes, and health outcomes will be extracted to describe MTBTs and understand the challenges encountered in context. Results will be presented using descriptive statistics, tables, figures, and narrative description to summarize the scope of the field. DISCUSSION Trends in MTBT feasibility and common challenges will be discussed to summarize major findings and highlight research gaps. Solutions to common challenges experienced by intervention participants and study staff will be proposed.

This is particularly relevant for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), that is the most common primary liver tumor, and it occurs in more than 90% of cases in the setting of cirrhosis. Methods: To address the increasing complexity of cancer care, multidisciplinary tumor boards (MDTBs) have evolved to offer patients appropriate and tailored cancer treatments. In Sicily (Italy), MDTBs have been organized in a Regional Network, the Sicily Network for Liver Cancer, that answers to the need for an equal and fair access to cancer care, to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic appropriateness, to ease patients care, to improve the efficacy of cancer treatments, and finally to optimize the risk-cost-benefit ratio of therapies and follow-up. Results: It has been shown that multidisciplinary management is associated with significantly improved survival in patients with liver cancer. In this study, we present the aims, the organization, and the current and future activities of the Sicily Network for Liver Cancer, an integrated health care multidisciplinary network for the management of patients with primary liver tumors in Sicily. Conclusions: The coexistence of two diseases (HCC and cirrhosis) requires the expertise of many physicians to provide optimal care to patients with HCC. Treatment decisions should be discussed in multidisciplinary meetings, as no single treatment strategy can be applied to all patients, and treatment must be individualized to improve overall survival of patients with liver tumors.","Celsa, Ciro; Cabibbo, Giuseppe; Pagano, Duilio; di Marco, Vito; Cammà, Calogero; Gruttadauria, Salvatore",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Infection with M. bovis and M. tuberculosis have significant implications for wildlife species management, public health, veterinary disease control, and conservation endeavours. RESULTS Here we describe the first use of the VetMAX™ Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) DNA quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detection kit for African wildlife samples. DNA was extracted from tissues harvested from 48 African buffaloes and MTBC DNA was detected (test-positive) in all 26 M. bovis culture-confirmed animals with an additional 12 PCR-positive results in culture-negative buffaloes (originating from an exposed population). Of six MTBC-infected African rhinoceros tested, MTBC DNA was detected in antemortem and postmortem samples from five animals. The PCR was also able to detect MTBC DNA in samples from two African elephants confirmed to have M. bovis and M. tuberculosis infections (one each). Culture-confirmed uninfected rhinoceros and elephants' samples tested negative in the PCR assay. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest this new detection kit is a sensitive screening test for the detection of MTBC-infected African buffaloes, African elephants and white rhinoceros.","Goosen, Wynand J; Kerr, Tanya J; Kleynhans, Léanie; Buss, Peter; Cooper, David; Warren, Robin M; van Helden, Paul D; Schröder, Björn; Parsons, Sven D C; Miller, Michele A",BMC veterinary research,155,5

The aim of this investigation was to evaluate regional cerebral oxygen desaturation in patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery in PP during routine anesthesia management. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between July 2013 and October 2013, 50 consecutive patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery under general anesthesia in PP were enrolled. The anesthetic technique was standardized. Using near-infrared spectroscopy, bilateral regional cerebrovascular oxygen saturation was recorded during the surgery. RESULTS After 30 and 60 minutes of prone repositioning, significant decreases in bilateral regional cerebral oxygen saturation were observed compared with the values in the supine position (from 76.24% to 73.18% at 30 min and 72.76% at 60 min on the right side and from 77.06% to 73.76% at 30 min and 72.92% at 60 min on the left side; P<0.05). These changes were not clinically important and returned to supine values after 90 minutes of prone positioning. Decreases in cerebral oxygen saturation were accompanied by reductions in heart rate and mean arterial pressure (P<0.05). Older age and higher perioperative risk had a significant effect on the reduction of cerebral oxygen values (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The results of our study show that margin of safety against impaired cerebral oxygenation can be maintained in PP. Preventing bradycardia and arterial hypotension is crucial. Older patients and those at higher perioperative risk need more meticulous attention.","Babakhani, Babak; Heroabadi, Arash; Hosseinitabatabaei, Narges; Schott, Martin; Yekaninejad, Saeed; Jantzen, Jan-Peter; Baumert, Jan-Hinrich",Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,155,28

However, in vivo detection of the status of brain thiamine metabolism is still unavailable and needs to be developed. METHODS A novel PET tracer of 18F-deoxy-thiamine was synthesized using an automated module via a two-step route. The main quality control parameters, such as specific activity and radiochemical purity, were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Radiochemical concentration was determined by radioactivity calibrator. Metabolic kinetics and the level of 18F-deoxy-thiamine in brains of mice and marmosets were studied by micro-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). In vivo stability, renal excretion rate, and biodistribution of 18F-deoxy-thiamine in the mice were assayed using HPLC and γ-counter, respectively. Also, the correlation between the retention of cerebral 18F-deoxy-thiamine in 60 min after injection as represented by the area under the curve (AUC) and blood thiamine levels was investigated. RESULTS The 18F-deoxy-thiamine was stable both in vitro and in vivo. The uptake and clearance of 18F-deoxy-thiamine were quick in the mice. It reached the max standard uptake value (SUVmax) of 4.61 ± 0.53 in the liver within 1 min, 18.67 ± 7.04 in the kidney within half a minute. The SUV dropped to 0.72 ± 0.05 and 0.77 ± 0.35 after 60 min of injection in the liver and kidney, respectively. After injection, kidney, liver, and pancreas exhibited high accumulation level of 18F-deoxy-thiamine, while brain, muscle, fat, and gonad showed low accumulation concentration, consistent with previous reports on thiamine distribution in mice. Within 90 min after injection, the level of 18F-deoxy-thiamine in the brain of C57BL/6 mice with thiamine deficiency (TD) was 1.9 times higher than that in control mice, and was 3.1 times higher in ICR mice with TD than that in control mice. The AUC of the tracer in the brain of marmosets within 60 min was 29.33 ± 5.15 and negatively correlated with blood thiamine diphosphate levels (r = - 0.985, p = 0.015). CONCLUSION The 18F-deoxy-thiamine meets the requirements for ideal PET tracer for in vivo detecting the status of cerebral thiamine metabolism.","Wang, Changpeng; Zhang, Siwei; Zou, Yuefei; Ma, Hongzhao; Jiang, Donglang; Sheng, Lei; Sang, Shaoming; Jin, Lirong; Guan, Yihui; Gui, Yuan; Xu, Zhihong; Zhong, Chunjiu",EJNMMI research,155,31

With fatality rates for CCHF ranging up to 70% based on several factors, CCHF is considered a dangerous emerging disease. Originally identified in the former Soviet Union and the Congo, CCHF has rapidly spread across large sections of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Recent reports have identified a viral homologue of the ovarian tumor protease superfamily (vOTU) within its L protein. This protease has subsequently been implicated in downregulation of the type I interferon immune response through cleavage of posttranslational modifying proteins ubiquitin (Ub) and the Ub-like interferon-simulated gene 15 (ISG15). Additionally, homologues of vOTU have been suggested to perform similar roles in the positive-sense, single-stranded RNA [ssRNA(+)] arteriviruses. By utilizing X-ray crystallographic techniques, the structure of vOTU covalently bound to ubiquitin propylamine, a suicide substrate of the enzyme, was elucidated to 1.7 Å, revealing unique structural elements that define this new subclass of the OTU superfamily. In addition, kinetic studies were carried out with aminomethylcoumarin (AMC) conjugates of monomeric Ub, ISG15, and NEDD8 (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 8) substrates in order to provide quantitative insights into vOTU's preference for Ub and Ub-like substrates.","Capodagli, Glenn C; McKercher, Marissa A; Baker, Erica A; Masters, Emily M; Brunzelle, Joseph S; Pegan, Scott D",Journal of virology,155,1

OBJECTIVES The aim was to evaluate serum HCY concentrations and its prognostic role in dogs with immunosuppressant-responsive enteropathy compared to healthy dogs. METHODS Serum HCY concentration was statistically compared between 24 healthy dogs and 29 dogs with immunosuppressant-responsive enteropathy. Correlation analyses between serum total protein, albumin (ALB), C-reactive protein (CRP), folate and cobalamin, and serum HCY concentration were performed in immunosuppressant-responsive enteropathic dogs. RESULTS The associations between serum HCY concentration and clinical, histological, endoscopic scores and follow-up were evaluated. Mean serum HCY concentration was higher in immunosuppressant-responsive enteropathic dogs compared to control dogs (30.22 ± 8.67 μmol/L vs. 5.26 ± 2.78 μmol/L; p < 0.0001). No association between serum HCY concentration and total protein, ALB, CRP, folate concentration as well as, clinical score, histological and endoscopic scores was found. A negative correlation between serum HCY concentration and cobalamin was noted (p = 0.0025, r = -0.54). No significant difference in HCY was found between responsive and non-responsive dogs or between survivors and non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS Although, serum HCY concentration was higher in immunosuppressant-responsive enteropathy, its prognostic value remains unclear. However, further prospective, large-scale studies are warranted to better investigate the possible prognostic role of HCY in immunosuppressant-responsive enteropathic dogs.","Benvenuti, Elena; Pierini, Alessio; Gori, Eleonora; Bottero, Enrico; Pietra, Marco; Lippi, Ilaria; Meucci, Valentina; Marchetti, Veronica",Journal of veterinary science,155,27

More than one-third of COVID-19 patients report neurological symptoms and cases of neurological diseases are increasingly accumulating. The aim of this systematic review was to characterize all - to date - reported cases with COVID-19 related myelopathy. Methods׃Eighteen papers were included in this review. Patients of all ages could be affected, although there is a predilection for middle-aged people. Results׃There were no significant co-morbidities or immunodeficiencies in the affected patients. COVID-19 related myelopathy started roughly within the first month after COVID-19 onset, either concomitantly with COVID-19 symptoms or within 10 days after their remission. The vast majority of cases fulfilled our criteria for postinfectious transverse myelitis. However, some cases were considered to have had parainfectious or infectious myelitis or, in one case, vascular myelopathy. Motor, sensory and bowel and/or bladder symptoms predominated the clinical presentation of myelopathies, explained mainly by centrally localized and longitudinally extensive lesions within the cervical and/or thoracic segments of the spinal cord. Occasionally lesions were complicated by necrosis and hemorrhages. Treatment with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange was offered mostly a mild to marked improvement within a period of some weeks. Conclusions׃ Considering the imminent arrival of new vaccines against COVID-19 pandemic, and their potential risk for postvaccination transverse myelitis, this characterization of COVID-19 related myelopathy is of utmost importance.","Artemiadis, Artemios; Liampas, Andreas; Hadjigeorgiou, Loizos; Zis, Panagiotis",Neurological research,155,19

Our aim was to report its prevalence and outcome in a series of hypoxemic patients upon Emergency Department admission. METHODS In this retrospective observational cohort study we enrolled a study population consisting of 213 COVID-19 patients with PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300 mmHg at hospital admission. Two groups (silent and dyspneic hypoxemia) were defined. Symptoms, blood gas analysis, chest X-ray (CXR) severity, need for intensive care and outcome were recorded. RESULTS Silent hypoxemic patients (68-31.9%) compared to the dyspneic hypoxemic patients (145-68.1%) showed greater frequency of extra respiratory symptoms (myalgia, diarrhea and nausea) and lower plasmatic LDH. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 225±68 mmHg and 192±78 mmHg in silent and dyspneic hypoxemia respectively (P=0.002). Eighteen percent of the patients with PaO2/FiO2 from 50 to 150 mmHg presented silent hypoxemia. Silent and dyspneic hypoxemic patients had similar PaCO2 (34.2±6.8 mmHg vs. 33.5±5.7 mmHg, P=0.47) but different respiratory rates (24.6±5.9 bpm vs. 28.6±11.3 bpm respectively, P=0.002). Even when CXR was severely abnormal, 25% of the population was silent hypoxemic. Twenty-six point five percent and 38.6% of silent and dyspneic patients were admitted to the ICU respectively (P=0.082). Mortality rate was 17.6% and 29.7% (log-rank P=0.083) in silent and dyspneic patients. CONCLUSIONS Silent hypoxemia is remarkably present in COVID-19.

The pathophysiology of such manifestations remains largely unknown. Objective To perform a systematic clinical, histologic, and biologic assessment in a cohort of patients with chilblain-like lesions occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants In this prospective case series carried out with a COVID-19 multidisciplinary consultation group at the University Hospital of Nice, France, 40 consecutive patients presenting with chilblain-like lesions were included. Main Outcomes and Measures Patients underwent a thorough general and dermatologic examination, including skin biopsies, vascular investigations, biologic analyses, interferon-alpha (IFN-α) stimulation and detection, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serologic analysis. Results Overall, 40 consecutive patients with chilblain-like lesions were included. Most patients were young, with a median (range) age of 22 (12-67) years; 19 were male and 21 were female. The clinical presentation was highly reproducible with chilblain-like lesions mostly on the toes. Bullous and necrotic evolution was observed in 11 patients. Acrocyanosis or cold toes were reported in 19 (47.5%) cases. Criteria compatible with COVID-19 cases were noted in 11 (27.5%) within 6 weeks prior to the eruption. The real-time PCR (rt-PCR) testing results were negative in all cases. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 serology results were positive in 12 patients (30%). D-dimer concentration levels were elevated in 24 (60.0%) cases. Cryoglobulinemia and parvovirus B19 serologic results were negative for all tested patients. The major histologic findings were features of lymphocytic inflammation and vascular damage with thickening of venule walls and pericyte hyperplasia. A significant increase of IFN-α production after in vitro stimulation was observed in the chilblain population compared with patients with mild-severe acute COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance Taken together, our results suggest that chilblain-like lesions observed during the COVID-19 pandemic represent manifestations of a viral-induced type I interferonopathy.

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to report our surgical results and follow-up outcome after SPSG. SETTING Department of Digestive Minimally Invasive Surgery, Antoine Béclère Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Paris-Saclay University, France. METHODS Data from consecutive patients who underwent SPSG in our institution between August 2010 and July 2015 were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Patients with more than 1-year follow-up were included in our analysis for weight loss and co-morbidity. RESULTS A total of 1000 patients underwent SPSG during the study period. Median body mass index was 42.6 kg/m² (range: 33.8-84.6 kg/m²). Median operative time was 112 minutes (range: 50-360 min) and decreased over the years. Completion of the procedure required introduction of an extraport in 78 patients (7.8%). Postoperative mortality and morbidity rates were .1% and 8.1%, respectively. Relaparoscopy and/or endoscopic treatment were required to treat intra-abdominal bleeding in 24 patients (2.4%) and staple-line leakage in 28 patients (2.8%).

Methods Between January 2018 and June 2019, 15 patients underwent ACL revision with double-bundle ACL reconstruction combined with ALL reconstruction. There were 12 males and 3 females with an average age of 30.1 years (range, 17-49 years). The technique of primary ACL reconstruction included single-bundle reconstruction in 13 cases and double-bundle reconstruction in 2 cases. These reconstructions applied autografts in 14 cases and allograft in 1 case. The causes of ACL reconstruction failure were identified as traumatic rupture in 9 cases and non-traumatic failure in 6 cases, including 2 cases of graft absorption and 3 cases of graft laxity. The average time from the primary ACL reconstruction to revision was 28.5 months (range, 8-60 months). The subjective and objective indicators of knee joint function were compared before operation and at last follow-up to evaluate the effectiveness. The subjective indicators included International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score. The objective indicators included anterior tibial translation (dynamic and static) and side-to-side difference (SSD), pivot-shift test, Lachman test, the difference of single-legged hop test, and the loss ratio of extensor muscle strength on the affected side. Results All incisions healed by first intetion, and no complications such as infection, venous thrombosis of lower extremity, or neurovascular injury occurred. All patients were followed up for an average of 19.1 months (range, 12-30 months). At last follow-up, all patients had returned to pre-injury sports level. The IKDC score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score were significantly improved ( P<0.05); anterior tibial translations (dynamic and static) significantly decreased when compared with preoperative one ( P<0.05) and returned to the physiological range. The SSD, Lachman test, pivot-shift test, the difference of single-legged hop test, and the loss ratio of extensor muscle strength on the affected side were significantly better than those before operation ( P<0.05).During the follow-up, there was no re-rupture of the graft, no stiffness of the knee joint and limitation of mobility; 1 case had a protruding femoral end compression screw, which was removed through the original incision under local anesthesia. Conclusion Double-bundle ACL reconstruction combined with ALL reconstruction can significantly improve the knee function in revision patients with ACL graft failure. It can reduce the anterior translation of tibia, and effectively prevent postoperative rotational instability of the knee.","Mao, Yunhe; Sun, Weihao; Fu, Weili; Li, Jian",Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi = Chinese journal of reparative and reconstructive surgery,155,4

The aim of this systematic review was to determine if physical fitness qualities were associated with performance of sport-specific technical skills in female, team-based ball players. METHODS Five databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, ProQuest, and Scopus) were searched for relevant studies up to April 15, 2019. Full-text articles investigating relationships between physical fitness and sport-specific technical skills in female, team-based ball players were included. Methodological quality of included studies was appraised using a modified Downs and Black checklist. Data synthesis was conducted to determine the summary of evidence based on the number of significantly associated relationships divided by the total relationships assessed. An individual relationship was defined as a reported result examining the association between a single physical fitness variable and a single sport-specific technical skill. RESULTS Data synthesis of grouped female ball players from 41 included studies revealed three clear associations: (i) body composition and defensive technical skills (19/29; 66%), (ii) agility and movement with a ball (4/6; 67%), and (iii) coordination and movement with a ball (3/5; 60%). An uncertain association exists between cardiorespiratory fitness and defensive technical skills (2/5; 40%). No association or an unknown conclusion (< 5 relationships reported) exists between all remaining physical fitness attributes and sport-specific technical skills. Sub-analyses revealed clear associations between body composition and throwing/shooting (using hands) in junior ball players (15/15; 100%) and with movement with a ball in elite (6/9; 67%) and senior (6/6; 100%) ball players. Three uncertain associations were found between offensive technical skills and agility in elite ball players (3/8; 38%), and with speed in elite (6/14; 43%) and junior (7/18; 39%) female ball players. CONCLUSION There is limited evidence available to demonstrate relationships between physical fitness qualities and sport-specific technical skills in female, team-based ball players. This lack of association is possibly due to reductionist methods in available literature and a lack of research in female ball players globally.

METHODS A total of 174 patients who underwent primary THA from September 2016 to July 2018 were selected. They were randomly divided into two groups, 86 patients with IV administration of 15 mg/kg TXA and 88 controls without TXA usage. Demographic data, TEG paremeters, d-dimer levels, fibrin degradation products, hemoglobin, hematocrit concentration, platelet, transfusion rates, perioperative blood loss, and the occurrence of deep vein thrombosis were collected. TEG and conventional laboratory tests were performed the day before operation, the first day after operation, and seventh day after operation. RESULTS There were no differences with regard to TEG or conventional laboratory tests between the two groups (p > 0.05). The total blood loss and drain blood loss in the TXA group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p < 0.05). The transfusion rates and the volume of blood transfusion of the control group were higher than those of the TXA group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION The administration of IV-TXA resulted in a significant reduction in total blood loss, transfusion volumes, and transfusion rates without the increase of thromboembolic complications. Moreover, it was confirmed that TXA would not change the coagulation via the TEG analysis.","Zhang, Xing-Chen; Sun, Ma-Ji; Pan, Sheng; Rui, Min; Zhao, Feng-Chao; Zha, Guo-Chun; Pang, Yong; Zheng, Xin; Guo, Kai-Jin",Journal of orthopaedic surgery,155,30

Through specificity and sensitivity tests, a real-time fluorescence-based recombinase-aided amplification (RF-RAA) method for detecting ILTV was established. The results showed that the method was specific and could be used to accurately detect ILTV, and there was no cross-reaction with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), avian influenza virus (AIV), or infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Real-time fluorescence-based recombinase-aided amplification had high sensitivity, and the lowest detectable limit (LDL) for ILTV could reach 10 copies/μL, 1,000 times more sensitive than conventional PCR (104 copies/μL), to rival that of real-time fluorescence-based quantitative PCR (RFQ-PCR) (10 copies/μL). This method and RFQ-PCR were used to detect 96 samples of chicken throat swabs with ILT initially diagnosed in clinic from the north of China, and the coincidence rate of the 2 methods was 100%. The RF-RAA reaction required only 20-30 minutes to completing, and its sensitivity was much higher than that of conventional PCR. Real-time fluorescence-based recombinase-aided amplification is similar to RFQ-PCR and has the advantages of specificity, sensitivity, and high efficiency, so it is suitable for early clinical detection and epidemiological investigation of ILTV.","Wang, Wenjing; Wang, Chunguang; Zhang, Zichuang; Zhang, Peng; Yao, Shanshan; Liu, Jingru; Zhai, Xianghe; Zhang, Tie",Poultry science,155,16

Heterozygotes for beta-thalassaemia (βThal+) constitute a non-negligible proportion of blood donors in the Mediterranean and other geographical areas. The unique haematological profile of βThal+ could affect capacity of enduring storage stress, however, the storability of βThal+ RBCs is largely unknown. In this study, RBCs from 18 βThal+ donors were stored in the cold and profiled for primary (haemolysis) and secondary (phosphatidylserine exposure, potassium leakage, oxidative stress) quality measures, and metabolomics, versus sex- and age-matched controls. The βThal+ units exhibited better levels of storage haemolysis and susceptibility to lysis following osmotic, oxidative and mechanical insults. Moreover, βThal+ RBCs had a lower percentage of surface removal signaling, reactive oxygen species and oxidative defects to membrane components at late stages of storage. Lower potassium accumulation and higher urate-dependent antioxidant capacity were noted in the βThal+ supernatant. Full metabolomics analyses revealed alterations in purine and arginine pathways at baseline, along with activation of pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis upstream to pyruvate kinase in βThal+ RBCs. Upon storage, substantial changes were observed in arginine, purine and vitamin B6 metabolism, as well as in the hexosamine pathway. A high degree of glutamate generation in βThal+ RBCs was accompanied by low levels of purine oxidation products (IMP, hypoxanthine, allantoin). The βThal mutations impact the metabolism and the susceptibility to haemolysis of stored RBCs, suggesting good post-transfusion recovery. However, haemoglobin increment and other clinical outcomes of βThal+ RBC transfusion deserve elucidation by future studies.","Tzounakas, Vassilis L; Anastasiadi, Alkmini T; Stefanoni, Davide; Cendali, Francesca; Bertolone, Lorenzo; Gamboni, Fabia; Dzieciatkowska, Monika; Rousakis, Pantelis; Vergaki, Athina; Soulakis, Vassilis; Tsitsilonis, Ourania E; Stamoulis, Konstantinos; Papassideri, Issidora S; Kriebardis, A Nastasios G; D'Alessandro, Angelo; Antonelou, Marianna H",Haematologica,155,1

DESIGN Retrospective analysis of several outcome measures. SETTING Pulmonary ward at a 358-bed community teaching hospital. METHODS 3-week inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation programme assessed by pulmonary function tests, 6 min walk test and health-related quality of life (HRQL) using the Short Form-36 (SF-36). RESULTS 17 patients with CPFE and 49 patients with COPD were referred to and completed the programme between March 2007 and February 2015. Age, sex, smoking status, body mass index and the Medical Research Council dyspnoea grade were comparable between groups. In the CPFE group, improvement from the start of the programme to the programme end was observed in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (from 1.7±0.4 to 1.8±0.4, p=0.034); however, there was no significant improvement in the 6 min walk test (distance, SpO2 nadir and Borg scale on exercise). With regard to HRQL, improvement was observed in physical function (p=0.015) whereas deterioration was observed in social functioning (p=0.044). In the COPD group, significant improvement was observed after the programme in the FEV1, 6 min walk test and 4 of the 8 SF-36 subscales. There was a significant difference in changes in the 6 min walk distance: -16.6±58.4 in CPFE versus 30.2±55.6 in COPD (p=0.009). In 2 domains, there was a significant difference in SF-36 scores between groups: Δvitality, -6.3±22.4 in CPFE versus 11.3±21.1 in COPD, p=0.009; and Δsocial functioning, -18.8±34.2 in CPFE versus 5.3±35.9 in COPD, p=0.027. CONCLUSION Patients with COPD derived greater benefits than those with CPFE, from the relatively short periods of inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation.","Tomioka, Hiromi; Mamesaya, Nobuaki; Yamashita, Shyuji; Kida, Yoko; Kaneko, Masahiro; Sakai, Hideki",BMJ open respiratory research,155,24

AIM: The aim of this systematic literature review is to detail and compare interventions supporting SDM over the last 10 years (January 2008 to December 2017) and to analyze patient/caregiver outcomes at the end of life. METHODS: This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched with key search terms: SDM, decision aid, decision support, palliative care, and hospice care. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 2705 articles, and 12 studies were included in the final review. The quality of the studies was modest and technology-enabled delivery modes (e.g., video, DVD, web-based tool) were most commonly used. Patient/caregiver knowledge of end-of-life care was the most common primary outcome across studies. The strength of the association between the SDM interventions and patient/caregiver outcomes varied. CONCLUSION: The findings from the studies that examined the effects of the SDM intervention on patient outcomes were inconsistent, highlighting the need for further SDM intervention studies among diverse patient populations using consistent measures. Given the availability of health technologies, future studies should focus on developing individual-tailored, technology-enabled interventions to support patient-centered medical decision making.","Baik, Dawon; Cho, Hwayoung; Masterson Creber, Ruth M",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,155,32

OUTCOME Performance on a cognitive battery assessing executive function and memory by using principal components analysis and white matter hyperintensity volume on brain imaging, evaluated in logistic and linear regression models. RESULTS In 335 participants, mean age was 73.4 +/- 8.1 years and 123 participants had microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria. Each doubling of ACR was associated with worse executive function (beta = -0.05; P = 0.005 in univariate and beta = -0.07; P = 0.004 in multivariable analyses controlling for age, sex, race, education, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, medications, and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]), but not with worse memory or working memory. Individuals with microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria were more likely to be in the lower versus the highest tertile of executive functioning (odds ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.32; odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 1.35 per doubling of ACR in univariate and multivariable analyses, respectively).

Study design The medical records of 80 patients who underwent laparoscopic adnexal surgery between May 2017 and April 2019 were reviewed. Of the 80 patients, 40 patients underwent gasless SPA laparoscopy using a J-shaped retractor and 40 underwent conventional SPA laparoscopy. All surgeries were performed by one laparoscopic surgeon. Surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS There are no significant differences in age, body mass index, parity, previous abdominal surgery, tumor marker, and tumor diameter between the gasless and conventional groups. The median retraction setup time from skin incision was 7 min (range 5-12 min) in gasless SPA laparoscopic adnexal surgery. The median total operation times were 55.5 min (range 30-155 min) in the gasless group and 55 min (range 30-165 min) in the conventional group without a significant difference. Additionally, there were no differences in operation type, conversion rate of laparotomy, use of an additional trocar, and pathological outcomes between the two groups. No major complications, such as urologic, bowel, and vessel injuries, were found in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Gasless SPA laparoscopy using a J-shaped retractor appears to offer a better alternative to conventional SPA laparoscopy that avoids the potential negative effects of carbon dioxide gas in selected cases.","Hwang, Jong Ha; Kim, Soo Rim; Kim, Jang Heub; Kim, Bo Wook",Surgical endoscopy,155,7

Little is known regarding global variation in patterns of use. Objective To provide insights into which EHR activities clinicians spend their time doing, the EHR tools they use, the system messages they receive, and the amount of time they spend using the EHR after hours. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study analyzed the deidentified metadata of ambulatory care health systems in the US, Canada, Northern Europe, Western Europe, the Middle East, and Oceania from January 1, 2019, to August 31, 2019. All of these organizations used the EHR software from Epic Systems and represented most of Epic Systems's ambulatory customer base. The sample included all clinicians with scheduled patient appointments, such as physicians and advanced practice practitioners. Exposures Clinician EHR use was tracked by deidentified and aggregated metadata across a variety of clinical activities. Main Outcomes and Measures Descriptive statistics for clinician EHR use included time spent on clinical activities, note documentation (as measured by the percentage of characters in the note generated by automated or manual data entry source), messages received, and time spent after hours. Results A total of 371 health systems were included in the sample, of which 348 (93.8%) were located in the US and 23 (6.2%) were located in other countries. US clinicians spent more time per day actively using the EHR compared with non-US clinicians (mean time, 90.2 minutes vs 59.1 minutes; P < .001). In addition, US clinicians vs non-US clinicians spent significantly more time performing 4 clinical activities: notes (40.7 minutes vs 30.7 minutes; P < .001), orders (19.5 minutes vs 8.75 minutes; P < .001), in-basket messages (12.5 minutes vs 4.80 minutes; P < .001), and clinical review (17.6 minutes vs 14.8 minutes; P = .01). Clinicians in the US composed more automated note text than their non-US counterparts (77.5% vs 60.8% of note text; P < .001) and received statistically significantly more messages per day (33.8 vs 12.8; P < .001). Furthermore, US clinicians used the EHR for a longer time after hours, logging in 26.5 minutes per day vs 19.5 minutes per day for non-US clinicians (P = .01). The median US clinician spent as much time actively using the EHR per day (90.1 minutes) as a non-US clinician in the 99th percentile of active EHR use time per day (90.7 minutes) in the sample. These results persisted after controlling for organizational characteristics, including structure, type, size, and daily patient volume. Conclusions and Relevance This study found that US clinicians compared with their non-US counterparts spent substantially more time actively using the EHR for a wide range of clinical activities or tasks. This finding suggests that US clinicians have a greater EHR burden that may be associated with nontechnical factors, which policy makers and health system leaders should consider when addressing clinician wellness.","Holmgren, A Jay; Downing, N Lance; Bates, David W; Shanafelt, Tait D; Milstein, Arnold; Sharp, Christopher D; Cutler, David M; Huckman, Robert S; Schulman, Kevin A",JAMA internal medicine,155,1

METHODS We tested the possibility of a fast-track protocol in 51 consecutive patients (mean age 65 ± 12 years) transferred from spokes centres or from the field to our HUB centre and admitted to our coronary care unit (CCU). Once the patient had arrived in the cath lab, the nasopharyngeal swab was performed. The real-time PCR to extract RNA for SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed with an automated rapid molecular Xpert Xpress test. Meanwhile, coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention was performed if necessary. RESULTS In this fast-track protocol, the time to perform nasopharyngeal swab was 11 ± 11 min; time spent to transport nasopharyngeal swab to the laboratory was 29 ± 20 min; time to detect viral nucleic acid was 68 ± 16 min. The overall time from the execution of nasopharyngeal swab to the result was 109 ± 26 min. The results were immediately put into the hospital computer system and made readily available. Depending on the test result, patients were then transferred to the regular CCU or Covid area. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that 0-1.5 h fast-track triage for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is feasible in patients with ACS. The execution of nasopharyngeal swab in the cath lab and its analysis with a rapid molecular test allows rapid stratification of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Spaccarotella, Carmen; Migliarino, Serena; Mongiardo, Annalisa; Curcio, Antonio; de Rosa, Salvatore; Corcione, Nicola; Quirino, Angela; Barreca, Giorgio Settimo; Giancotti, Aida; Peronace, Cinzia; Marascio, Nadia; Matera, Giovanni; Indolfi, Ciro",Journal of cardiovascular medicine,155,28

In these situations, classical reconstruction algorithms, like simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART), cannot reconstruct high-quality CT images. Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D)-based iterative reconstruction algorithm (POCS-BM3D) has remarkable effect in dealing with CT reconstruction from noisy projections. However, BM3D may restrain noise with excessive loss of details in the case of low-SNR CT reconstruction. In order to achieve a preferable trade-off between noise suppression and edge preservation, we introduce guided image filtering (GIF) into low-SNR CT reconstruction, and propose noise suppression-guided image filtering reconstruction (NSGIFR) algorithm. In each iteration of NSGIFR, the output image of SART reserves more details and is used as input image of GIF, while the image denoised by BM3D serves as guidance image of GIF. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm displays outstanding performance on preserving structures and suppressing noise for low-SNR CT reconstruction. NSGIFR can achieve more superior image quality than SART, POCS-TV and POCS-BM3D in terms of visual effect and quantitative analysis.

Comprehensive understanding of the basis for MPL claims can improve gastroenterologists' practice, lower MPL risk, and improve the overall patient care experience. This is particularly relevant in the setting of the increasing average compensation per paid GI-related MPL claim, and evolving healthcare delivery patterns and regulations.Areas Covered: MPL claims are generally grounded in the concept of negligence, a broad term that may apply to situations involving medical errors, ameliorable adverse events, inadequate informed consent and/or refusal, and numerous others. Though often not directly discussed in GI training or thereafter, there are various mechanisms and behaviors that can alter (decrease or increase) MPL risk. Additional dimensions of MPL include telemedicine, social media, and vicarious liability. We discuss these topics as well as takeaways to mitigate risk, thus reducing unnecessary clinician anxiety, promoting professional development, and optimizing healthcare outcomes.Expert Opinion: MPL risk is modifiable. Strong provider-patient relationships, through effective communication, patient reassurance, and enhanced informed consent, decrease risk, as does thorough documentation. Conversely, provider ""defensive"" mechanisms intended to decrease MPL risk, including assurance and avoidance behaviors, may paradoxically increase it.","Azizian, John; Dalai, Camellia; Adams, Megan A; Murcia, Andrew; Tabibian, James H",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,155,19

Doll therapy (DT) is a controversial method observed in clinical practice that has both promising benefits and potential ethical concerns. To date, little research has been done on this therapy. METHODS A PubMed search was performed using the keywords ""dementia,"" ""elderly,"" ""dolls,"" ""doll therapy,"" and ""Alzheimer's disease."" A list of pertinent articles was assembled, with irrelevant articles excluded. References from these articles were also reviewed and additional articles were included in the final list. RESULTS Research on the utility of DT for patients with MNCD is limited. Current literature suggests that DT may be beneficial in decreasing the use of pharmacologic interventions and alleviating symptoms such as agitation and anxiety. However, most studies consisted of small, unrepresentative sample populations. CONCLUSIONS Preliminary studies favor DT as an effective management strategy for behavioral symptoms of MNCD. However, the few existing randomized controlled trials are limited in size and demographics. Further research involving larger, more diverse study samples with more male patients is needed. Additionally, the exact parameters to guide this therapy have not been established and require investigative study.","Chinnaswamy, Kala; DeMarco, Dominic M; Grossberg, George T",Annals of clinical psychiatry : official journal of the American Academy of Clinical Psychiatrists,155,28

The toxic components are not known, but it has been suggested that the diterpene acids may be both toxic and abortifacient. One hundred sixty-two samples of snakeweed were collected from 55 locations in Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Texas, Wyoming and Utah and were taxonomically classified. Samples were analyzed by GC-MS in a chemophenetic analysis and grouped into individual chemotypes based on diterpene acid content. The GC-MS profiles were found to be diverse showing at least eight different chemotypes. From each of the chemotypes the major diterpene acids were isolated and characterized by IR, MS and NMR spectroscopy. Twenty-one diterpenoids were identified and found to be a mix of furano, lactone, di-acid and esters of labdane, ent-labdane and chlerodane acids and alcohols. Only four of the 21 compounds isolated had been previously reported as occurring in G. sarathorea or G. microcephala, while another eight compounds were previously reported from other Gutierrezia or related species.

Although attempts have been made to classify intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetrators based on ANS reactivity to acute stress, subsequent studies have failed to replicate this classification. Notably, the proposed classification neglected the role of chronic alcohol abuse in ANS dysregulation and the fact that this dysregulation entails an abnormal stress response. The aim of the present study was to analyze the response profile (psychological state and ANS response) of groups of IPV perpetrators with high (n = 27) and low (n = 33)-risk alcohol use to an acute stressor, compared to controls (n = 35). All IPV perpetrators scored higher on executive dysfunctions and impulsivity and showed larger decreases in positive affect, less satisfaction, and a higher external locus of control after the stressor than controls. IPV perpetrators with low-risk alcohol use had higher skin conductance levels and breathing reactivity than controls, especially during preparatory, task, and recovery periods. This information could help to develop methods for increasing batterers' behavioral self-regulation, thus decreasing IPV recidivism risk.","Vitoria-Estruch, Sara; Romero-Martínez, Ángel; Lila, Marisol; Moya-Albiol, Luis",International journal of environmental research and public health,155,19

However, a clear understanding how the disease-associated APOL1 variants cause kidney injury and the identity of environmental stressors that trigger the injury process have not been determined. RECENT FINDINGS Basic mechanistic studies of APOL1 biochemistry and cell biology, bolstered by new antibody reagents and inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived cell systems, have focused on the cytotoxic effect of the risk variants when APOL1 gene expression is induced. Since the APOL1 variants evolved to alter a key protein-protein interaction with the trypanosome serum resistance-associated protein, additional studies have begun to address differences in APOL1 interactions with other proteins expressed in podocytes, including new observations that APOL1 variants may alter podocyte cytoskeleton dynamics. SUMMARY A unified mechanism of pathogenesis for the various APOL1 nephropathies still remains unclear and controversial. As ongoing studies have consistently implicated the pathogenic gain-of-function effects of the variant proteins, novel therapeutic development inhibiting the synthesis or function of APOL1 proteins is moving toward clinical trials.","Bruggeman, Leslie A; Sedor, John R; O'Toole, John F",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,155,1

A cohort study was conducted to investigate the role of a lightweight titanized mesh placed in the pre-peritoneal space after AAA repair. The primary endpoint was to determine the incidence of IH at eight weeks and 12 months. Methods Consecutive patients who underwent open repair of AAA with the prophylactic implantation of a mesh after abdominal wall closure were recruited. The development of IH was evaluated using clinical examination, ultrasonography scan (USS), and computed tomography (CT) scan during the follow-up period. Results Thirty-nine of 45 patients (34 male, 5 female, mean age 69.6 +/- 6.5 years) undergoing open repair of AAA over a five-year period via a preferred roof-top incision were analyzed for this study. One additional (2.5%) patient had the mesh explanted following a re-laparotomy for colonic ischemia and later developed an incisional hernia. There was no incidence of wound or mesh infection overall. One radiologically detected early IH closed spontaneously. There were five (12.8%) radiologically detected late cases of midline or paramedian defects beyond the one-year follow-up though this was not clinically significant; compared to this, there was no incidence of lateral defects in the wound (p<0.01, McNemar's test). Conclusion These preliminary results suggest that a dedicated lightweight titanized mesh is usable for primary reinforcement of rooftop incisions at the time of wound closure. Whilst this study supports the role of a mesh as a useful adjunct, larger studies and long-term follow-up would provide more sensitive assessments of its efficacy.","Akingboye, Akinfemi; Chaudhuri, Arindam",Cureus,155,24

In total, 58 patients (21 men, 37 women, mean age 51.6 years [range 24-76 years]) with benign intracranial lesions (including benign tumors and vascular lesions) and neuralgia of the trigeminal nerve were included in this prospective study. Extensive cognitive testing was used to categorize attention, memory, and executive functions. Mood and pain were assessed preoperatively (t0, mean 3.7 days before surgery), immediately after surgery/during inpatient stay (t1, mean 7.6 days after surgery), and at first outpatient check-up (t2, mean 99.5 days after surgery). All 58 patients were tested at t0 and t1, but at t2 only 24 patients were available at t2. The data were categorized as improvement/stable condition or deterioration and shown as percentages. The pre- and postoperative values of BDI-II and mood were compared by the Wilcoxon test for paired samples. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify parameters influencing cognition in the subgroup of meningioma patients. Immediately after surgery (t1), the percentage of patients with improvement/stable condition was > 50% in all categories in the majority of subtests (attention: 12/14 subtests, memory: 11/13 subtests, executive functions: 6/9 subtests). Similar results were shown at t2. Mood and pain did not change significantly after surgery. Factors like age, Karnofsky performance status, and tumor volume were not shown as significant influencing factors for cognitive functions in meningioma patients. The results of this study suggest that-in contrast to neuroepithelial tumors-cognitive functions do not deteriorate after surgery of benign intracranial lesions. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the results of this study.","Bette, Stefanie; Ruhland, Julia M; Wiestler, Benedikt; Barz, Melanie; Meyer, Bernhard; Zimmer, Claus; Ryang, Yu-Mi; Ringel, Florian; Gempt, Jens",Scientific reports,155,30

We designed a multiwave, multisource study examining whether a proactive orientation is a key resource for frontline health care professionals in the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing from proactive and conservation of resources theories, we studied a sample of 408 doctors and nurses at a COVID-19 hospital in the locked-down area surrounding Wuhan City, China during the first wave of the virus. Our aim is to examine how personal agency contributes to health care professionals' performance and well-being when combating COVID-19. Proactive personality as a dispositional resource was associated with higher levels of perceived strengths use, a job-related motivational resource. This effect was jointly moderated by routine disruption and perceived organizational support. Proactive personality was indirectly associated with performance and two indicators of well-being (resilience and thriving) through perceived strengths use. More frequent physical exposure to the virus magnified the effects of perceived strengths use on an archival indicator of performance during the first wave of the pandemic.

An increase in temperature of 2.2 to 7 °C is predicted to occur within the next century in the worst-case scenario of climate change predictions, which will likely be associated with an increase in the prevalence and duration of reduced water oxygen levels (hypoxia). Furthermore, there is an increasing frequency of heat waves in the Amazon basin, which exacerbates issues related to temperature and hypoxia. Increases in temperature and hypoxia both constrain an organism's ability to supply oxygen to metabolizing tissues, thus the ability to cope with thermal and hypoxic stress may be correlated. Here, we reveal a positive correlation between acute thermal tolerance and acute hypoxia tolerance amongst 37 Amazonian fish species at the current river temperatures of 28-31 °C. The effects of long-term (10 days or 4 weeks) increases in temperature were investigated in a subset of 13 species and demonstrated that 2 species failed to acclimate and survive at 33 °C, 9 species failed at 35 °C, and only 2 species survived up to 35 °C. Of those that survived long-term exposure to 33 or 35 °C, the majority of the species demonstrated only an improvement in acute thermal tolerance. In contrast, hypoxia tolerance was reduced following acute- and long-term exposure to 33, 35 or 37 °C in all species investigated. The results of this study suggest that many of the fish species that inhabit the Amazon may be at risk during both short- and long-term temperature increases and these risks are exacerbated by the associated environmental hypoxia.","Jung, Ellen H; Brix, Kevin V; Richards, Jeffrey G; Val, Adalberto L; Brauner, Colin J",The Science of the total environment,155,1

Inflammation is mainly managed using conventional medicines that are associated with many side effects. Plant-based remedies are considerably better alternative therapies for they have fewer side effects. Objective This study aimed at determining the anti-inflammatory potential of dichloromethane (DCM) leaf extracts of Eucalyptus globulus and Senna didymobotrya in mice. Methods Fresh leaves of these plants were harvested from Embu County, Kenya. Quantitative phytochemical analysis was done using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Anti-inflammatory test comprised nine groups of five animals each: normal, negative, positive controls and 6 experimental groups. Inflammation was induced with Carrageenan. One hour post-treatment, the different groups were intraperitoneally administered with the reference drug, diclofenac, 3% DMSO and six DCM leaf extracts at doses of 25, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250mg/kgbw. Results GC-MS results revealed α-phellandrene, camphene, terpinolene, and limonene among others. Anti-inflammatory effects showed that extract doses of 100,150,200 and 250mg/kg bw significantly reduced the inflamed paw. Doses of 200 and 250mg/kgbw in both plants were more potent and compared with diclofenac. E. globulus extract dose of 250mg kg bw reduced inflamed paw in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th hours, by 2.27,6.52,9.09 and 10.90% respectively while S.didymobotrya at similar dose ranges, inflamed paw reduced by 2.41, 5.43, 8.31 and 9.05% respectively. Conclusion E. globulus and S. didymobotrya have potent anti-inflammatory activities, attributed to their constituent phytochemicals. This study confirms the traditional use of these plants in treating inflammation.","Mworia, Joseph Kiambi; Kibiti, Cromwell Mwiti; Ngeranwa, Joseph Jn; Ngugi, Mathew Piero",African health sciences,155,1

However, the conventional MATHE procedure is less radical than transthoracic esophagectomy due to operative view limitations and insufficient mediastinal lymphadenectomy. In upper mediastinal dissection, the conventional MATHE procedure only provides esophageal mobilization with or without lymph node sampling. We developed a novel MATHE procedure with en bloc mediastinal lymphadenectomy by introducing a single-port laparoscopic technique. METHODS The patient was placed in a supine position with bilateral lung ventilation. The upper mediastinal dissection, using a left cervical approach, was performed with a single-port mediastinoscopic technique. A laparoscope was used as a 'mediastinoscope'. The lymph nodes along the right recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) were dissected under direct vision using a right cervical approach. Bilateral cervical approaches were followed by hand-assisted laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy. RESULTS A single-port technique provides a favorable expansion of the mediastinal space by carbon dioxide insufflation, and improves the visibility and handling in the deep mediastinum around the aortic arch, allowing for en bloc lymphadenectomy in the upper mediastinum including the subaortic arch lymph nodes. In addition, a hand-assisted laparoscopic transhiatal procedure allows for en bloc lymphadenectomy in the middle and lower mediastinum including the subcarinal and bilateral main bronchial lymph nodes. Cervical and transhiatal procedures were performed safely and carefully under video-assisted magnified vision according to the standardized procedure with an appropriate operative field expansion using retractors. CONCLUSIONS Single-port MATHE is feasible as a novel minimally invasive surgery for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) or thoracic esophageal cancer.","Fujiwara, Hitoshi; Shiozaki, Atsushi; Konishi, Hirotaka; Otsuji, Eigo",Journal of visualized surgery,155,16

Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and other nucleic acid sensors are involved in innate immune responses. The activation of innate immune responses can facilitate the host to eliminate pathogens and maintain tissue homeostasis. However, the activity of innate immune responses needs to be tightly controlled to ensure the optimal intensity and duration of activation under various contexts. Uncontrolled innate immune responses can lead to various disorders associated with aberrant inflammatory response, including pulmonary diseases such as COPD, asthma, and COVID-19. In this chapter, we will have a broad overview of how innate immune responses function and the regulation and activation of innate immune response at molecular levels as well as their contribution to various pulmonary diseases. A better understanding of such association between innate immune responses and pulmonary diseases may provide potential therapeutic strategies.","Liu, Tao; Liu, Siqi; Zhou, Xiaobo",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,155,30

However, surgery is associated with complications such as permanent incontinence, which reduces quality of life. OBJECTIVE To determine the rate of complete clinical healing of anal fistulas after irrigation of the fistula tract with silver nitrate solution as a nonsurgical treatment. DESIGN Prospective single arm study. SETTING Tertiary university hospital PATIENTS : Adult patients with symptomatic perianal fistula presenting between June 2012 and January 2013. INTERVENTION Irrigation of the fistula tract with 1% silver nitrate solution. Irrigation was repeated every 2 weeks when necessary. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure was the rate of complete clinical healing. RESULTS Fifty-six consecutive patients with anal fistula were analyzed. Of those, 29 (52%) had complete clinical healing without recurrence for a median of 10 months. The median number of irrigations needed for complete clinical healing was 4 (1-10). The level of satisfaction was excellent in patients with complete clinical healing. The frequency of complaints was the only independent factor that had an impact on healing; patients with intermittent discharge had a significantly higher rate of complete clinical healing (67%) than those with continuous discharge (40%). There were no notable complications. LIMITATIONS Short follow-up, small sample size, and no comparisons. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that the application of silver nitrate solution often produces a favorable outcome in the treatment of anal fistula. This method may be considered as a first-line treatment for the disease because it is simple, performed on an outpatient basis, minimally invasive, and lacks the complications encountered with current conventional surgical modalities.","Attaallah, Wafi; Tuney, Davut; Gulluoglu, Bahadir M; Ugurlu, M Umit; Gunal, Omer; Yegen, Cumhur",Diseases of the colon and rectum,155,25

Specific perceptions of NIV stakeholders and their impact have been poorly described to date. The objectives of this study were to compare the perceptions of NIV by intensive care unit (ICU) physicians, nurses, patients, and their relatives and to explore factors associated with caregivers' willingness to administer NIV and patients' and relatives' anxiety in relation to NIV. METHODS This is a prospective, multicenter questionnaire-based study. RESULTS Three hundred and eleven ICU physicians, 752 nurses, 396 patients, and 145 relatives from 32 ICUs answered the questionnaire. Nurses generally reported more negative feelings and more frequent regrets about providing NIV (median score, 3; interquartile range, [1 to 5] vs. 1 [1 to 5]; P < 0.0001) compared to ICU physicians. Sixty-four percent of ICU physicians and only 32% of nurses reported a high level of willingness to administer NIV, which was independently associated with NIV case-volume and workload. A high NIV session-related level of anxiety was observed in 37% of patients and 45% of relatives. ""Dyspnea during NIV,"" ""long NIV session,"" and ""the need to have someone at the bedside"" were identified as independent risk factors of high anxiety in patients. CONCLUSIONS Lack of willingness of caregivers to administer NIV and a high level of anxiety of patients and relatives in relation to NIV are frequent in the ICU. Most factors associated with low willingness to administer NIV by nurses or anxiety in patients and relatives may be amenable to change. Interventional studies are now warranted to evaluate how to reduce these risk factors and therefore contribute to better management of a potentially traumatic experience.

INTRODUCTION Every year, 2.5 million newborns die and 2.6 million more are stillborn worldwide. While many perinatal deaths are preventable, their reduction has been markedly slower than the decline of maternal or child mortality rates. It is hypothesized that neonatal near miss is part of the spectrum of stillbirth-neonatal death and that auditing these cases might reduce perinatal mortality and morbidity. INCLUSION CRITERIA This review will consider neonatal near-miss audits implemented in health care facilities worldwide. Randomized controlled trials, cluster-randomized trials, quasi-randomized controlled trials, controlled before-and-after studies, interrupted time series, case-control, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies and case series will be included. Conference abstracts, letters, studies duplicating validation data from previous studies, gray literature, and unpublished studies will be excluded. METHODS Using the JBI guidelines for conducting systematic reviews of effectiveness, the review will search the following electronic bibliographic databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, and SciELO. No publication date or language limits will be imposed. Two independent reviewers will screen titles, abstracts, and full-text studies, assessing methodological quality with the JBI critical appraisal tools. GRADE will be used to assess the confidence in the findings. Covidence will be used for data extraction and management. A meta-analysis will be performed if the selected studies are sufficiently homogeneous. If not, the results will be discussed as a narrative synthesis.

Although pharmacological treatment is generally well tolerated, 5%-20% of patients with hypertension are resistant to medical therapy, which is defined as blood pressure above goal (>140/90 mmHg in general; >130-139/80-85 mmHg in patients with diabetes mellitus; >130/80 mmHg in patients with chronic kidney disease) despite treatment with ≥3 antihypertensive drugs of different classes, including a diuretic, at optimal doses. These patients are at significantly higher risk for cardiovascular events, in particular stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure, as compared with patients with nonresistant hypertension. The etiology of resistant hypertension is multifactorial and a number of risk factors have been identified. In addition, resistant hypertension might be due to secondary causes such as primary aldosteronism, chronic kidney disease, renal artery stenosis, or obstructive sleep apnea. To identify patients with resistant hypertension, the following must be excluded: pseudo-resistance, which might be due to nonadherence to medical treatment; white-coat effect; and inaccurate measurement technique. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system contributes to the development and maintenance of hypertension by increasing renal renin release, decreasing renal blood flow, and enhancing tubular sodium retention. Catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) is a novel technique specifically targeting renal sympathetic nerves. Clinical trials have demonstrated that RDN significantly reduces blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension. Experimental studies and small clinical studies indicate that RDN might also have beneficial effects in other diseases and comorbidities, characterized by increased sympathetic activity, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, metabolic syndrome and hyperinsulinemia, atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic kidney disease. Further controlled studies are required to investigate the role of RDN beyond blood pressure control.","Urban, Daniel; Ewen, Sebastian; Ukena, Christian; Linz, Dominik; Böhm, Michael; Mahfoud, Felix",Integrated blood pressure control,155,1

The China Human Brain Banking Consortium was established recently to foster brain donation in China. The purpose of this study was to gain information about the public perception of and attitudes toward brain donation and to identify factors that may impact the willingness to participate in brain donation among the Chinese people. A specifically designed questionnaire was delivered to community residents in Changsha (the capital city of Hunan province) with a total of 1,249 completed forms returned and statistically analyzed. The majority of the participants considered that brain donation would help medical research and education, and 32.0% of respondents agreed that the brain donation would help change the traditional Chinese funeral belief in keeping the body intact after death. However, participants aged over 60 years old were less supportive of this concept. Among all participants, 63.7% stated that they were not knowledgeable about brain donation, while 26.4% explicitly expressed a willingness to participate in brain donation. Age, gender, monthly household income, and knowledge about brain donation significantly affected the willingness. Compared with other age groups, a higher proportion of participants aged over 60 years old preferred to be informed by a medical college. To promote brain donation in China, especially among the elderly, better communication of its medical benefits and a reinterpretation of the Confucius view of the human body should be provided. Efforts are also needed to provide appropriate forums and sources of brain donation information to targeted communities and society in general.","Zhang, Qi; Deng, Jing; Li, Ya-Nan; Gou, Yue; Yan, Xiao-Xin; Li, Fang; Pan, Ai-Hua",Anatomical sciences education,155,16

METHODS Between April 2013 and July 2019, 41 patients presenting with acute complicated (n = 29) or chronic (n = 12) descending thoracic aortic dissection were treated by the FET technique, which was the treatment of choice when supra-aortic vessel transposition would not suffice to create a satisfactory proximal landing zone for endovascular aortic repair, when a concomitant ascending or arch aneurysm was present, or in patients with connective tissue diseases. RESULTS One patient (2%) died intra-operatively secondary to an aortic rupture in dwnstream aortic segments. No post-operative deaths occurred. Four patients (10%) suffered a non-disabling posto-operative stroke and were discharged with no clinical symptoms (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0, n = 1), no significant disability (mRS 1, n = 2), or with slight disability (mRS 2, n = 1). No spinal cord ischaemia was observed. The primary entry tear was either surgically resected or excluded from circulation in all patients. During follow up, one patient (2%) died after two years (not aorta related) and 16 patients (39%) underwent an aortic re-intervention after 7.7 [interquartile range 0.7, 15.8] months (endovascular aortic repair: n = 14; open thoraco-abdominal aortic replacement: n = 1, hybrid approach: n = 1). CONCLUSION The FET technique is an effective treatment option for acute complicated and chronic Type B or non-A non-B aortic dissection in patients in whom primary endovascular aortic repair is non-feasible. While the post-operative outcome is acceptable with a relatively low incidence of non-disabling strokes, this study also underlines the considerable need for aortic re-interventions. Continuous follow up of all patients undergoing the FET procedure is essential.","Kreibich, Maximilian; Siepe, Matthias; Berger, Tim; Kondov, Stoyan; Morlock, Julia; Pingpoh, Clarence; Beyersdorf, Friedhelm; Rylski, Bartosz; Czerny, Martin",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,155,1

More recently, mechanical methods for assessment of spinal stiffness have demonstrated superior accuracy and reliability. However, mechanical methods of spinal stiffness assessment can be expensive, time consuming and/or unsuited to clinical practice. While a new device has been designed to address these issues (VerteTrack), its benchtop performance remains unknown. AIM To measure the bench-top performance of VerteTrack. METHODS A series of laboratory-based experiments were conducted in February 2018 to investigate the accuracy (precision and bias) of load and displacement measurements obtained by VerteTrack and then were compared against an appropriate reference standard. Measurements of both multiple-level continuous assessment (multiple spinal levels measured), and single-level assessment (single spinal level measured) were performed on a viscoelastic foam medium (AIREX® balance beam, Switzerland) and the resulting stiffness calculated. RESULTS VerteTrack demonstrated high precision at all loads and displacements. There was minimal systematic measurement bias identified for applied versus reference load (mean bias = - 0.123 N; 95%CI - 0.182 to 0.428 N, p < .001), and no systematic measurement bias for measured versus reference displacement (mean difference = 0.02 mm; 95%CI - 0.09 to 0.14 mm, p < .001). The magnitude of stiffness obtained during multiple-level continuous assessment was on average 0.25 N/mm (2.79%) less than that for single-level assessment (95%CI - 0.67 to 0.17 N/mm, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS VerteTrack demonstrated high accuracy (high precision, low bias) under bench-top conditions. The difference in stiffness found between multiple versus single spinal levels should be considered in the research context, but is unlikely to be clinically relevant. The results of this study demonstrate that VerteTrack may be suitable for both single and multi-level spinal stiffness measurements in-vivo.","Young, Anika; Swain, Michael S; Kawchuk, Gregory N; Wong, Arnold Y L; Downie, Aron S",Chiropractic & manual therapies,155,0

The aim of this prospective study is to characterize the level of consciousness in patients undergoing PS using Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring. PATIENTS AND METHODS We enrolled consecutive patients with refractory symptoms requiring PS. We documented the level of sedation using Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) and BIS at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h during the first day of PS and examined their degree of association. Intravenous midazolam or propofol was titrated according to the sedation level. RESULTS Twenty patients on PS were recruited and had BIS continuous monitoring. Delirium was the most frequent reason for PS (n = 15, 75%). The median time of sedation was 24.5 h (interquartile range 6-46). The average time to achieve the desired sedation level was 6 h, and dose titration was required in 80% of the cases. At baseline, 14 (70%) patients were considered to be awake according to RSS (i.e., 1-3) and 19 (95%) were awake according to BIS (i.e., >60%). This proportion decreased to 31 and 56% at 4 h, 27% and 53 at 6 h, and 22 and 33% at 24 h. RS and BIS had moderate correlation (rho = -0.58 to -0.65); however, a small proportion of patients were found to be awake by BIS (i.e., ≥60%) despite clinical observation (i.e., RSS 4-6) indicating otherwise.

METHODS MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched to identify peer-reviewed studies that examined cognitive communication impairments in children who sustained a TBI between 3 months to 18 years of age. RESULTS Twenty-eight studies met inclusion criteria with 3 main categories identified in relation to cognitive communication: (1) impairments according to TBI severity, (2) impairments according to age at injury, and (3) trends in recovery according to TBI severity. CONCLUSIONS The results of this scoping review suggest that (1) TBI severity is not the sole predictor of performance; other factors contribute to cognitive communication outcome and recovery; (2) developing skills at time of injury are most susceptible to impairment; and (3) standard, norm-referenced language assessments are not sensitive in detecting language impairments that are secondary to cognitive impairments found in TBI.

We aim to share the challenges that Hematology Oncology Pharmacy (HOP) residents faced during the quarantine period and provide recommendations on how to cope with the residency journey. METHOD We followed a qualitative methodological approach in March 2020 using a structured virtual group discussion for data generation. RESULTS All six PGY2 hematology oncology pharmacy (HOP) residents were included in the group discussion. The group agreed that the need for HOP services during this pandemic is beyond the scope of oncology pharmacists' normal daily practice. The group recognized two fundamental points. First, the goal of the current training should be customized to the most pressing need and recognized at the national level. Second, the current training system should be improved to ensure efficient use of current resources. On this basis, the group developed six main recommendations for action. CONCLUSION The current situation is a challenge for all healthcare providers, and the majority of the nation's current generation never dealt with such a situation in days gone by. This paper presents the challenges that should be addressed at the national level and provide a fundamental consensus recommendation for practical approaches to maximize learning and minimize disruption to trainees' progression while maintaining patient-pharmacy quality of care.","AlAzmi, Aeshah A; AlNajjar, Fouad; AlShomrani, Majed",Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,155,25

Liver surgery can be associated with excessive intraoperative blood loss, not only because the liver is a highly vascularized organ, but also because it plays a central role in the hemostatic system. Intraoperative blood loss and transfusion of blood products have been shown to be negatively associated with postoperative outcome after liver surgery. Dysfunction of the liver is frequently accompanied with a dysfunctional hemostatic system. However, in general, there is a poor correlation between preoperative coagulation tests and the intraoperative bleeding risk in patients undergoing liver surgery. Strategies to avoid excessive blood loss in liver surgery have been an active field of research and include three different areas: surgical methods, anesthesiological methods, and pharmacological agents.Surgeons can minimize blood loss by clamping the hepatic vasculature, by using specific dissection devices, and by using topical hemostatic agents. Anesthesiologists play an important role in minimizing blood loss by avoiding intravascular fluid overload. Maintaining a low central venous pressure has shown to be very effective in reducing blood loss during partial liver resections. Prophylactic transfusion of blood products such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) has not been shown to reduce intraoperative bleeding and even seems counterproductive as it results in an increase of the intravascular filling status, which may enhance the bleeding risk. In patients with liver cirrhosis, there is increasing evidence that factors such as portal hypertension and the hyperdynamic circulation play a more important role in the bleeding tendency than changes in the coagulation system. Therefore, intravenous fluid restriction rather than prophylactic administration of large volumes of blood products (i.e., FFP) is recommended in patients undergoing major liver surgery. Pharmacological agents such as antifibrinolytic drugs or recombinant factor VIIa may be indicated in selected individual patients, but these agents do not have a routine role in the management of patients undergoing liver surgery.","Stellingwerff, Menno; Brandsma, Amarins; Lisman, Ton; Porte, Robert J",Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,155,1

It is expected that the proliferation of Internet-based reports has resulted in greater communication and improved surveillance and reporting frameworks, especially with the revision of the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), which went into force in 2007. However, there has been no global quantitative assessment of whether and how outbreak detection and communication processes have actually changed over time. In this study, we analyzed the entire WHO public record of Disease Outbreak News reports from 1996 to 2009 to characterize spatial-temporal trends in the timeliness of outbreak discovery and public communication about the outbreak relative to the estimated outbreak start date. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses show that overall, the timeliness of outbreak discovery improved by 7.3% [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.073, 95% CI (1.038; 1.110)] per year, and public communication improved by 6.2% [HR = 1.062, 95% CI (1.028; 1.096)] per year. However, the degree of improvement varied by geographic region; the only WHO region with statistically significant (α = 0.05) improvement in outbreak discovery was the Western Pacific region [HR = 1.102 per year, 95% CI (1.008; 1.205)], whereas the Eastern Mediterranean [HR = 1.201 per year, 95% CI (1.066; 1.353)] and Western Pacific regions [HR = 1.119 per year, 95% CI (1.025; 1.221)] showed improvement in public communication.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the incidence and potential risk factors for thromboembolic lesions after treatment with a Pipeline embolization device (PED). METHODS This prospective study included a total of 59 patients electively treated with a PED over 12 months. Postprocedural diffusion-weighted imaging sequences of the brain were obtained 24 h after interventions to detect ischemic lesions. Demographic data, aneurysm characteristics, antiplatelet management, and perioperative data were correlated with the rate of ischemic events. RESULTS The incidence of silent ischemic events after use of a PED was 62.7% (37 patients) and neurological symptoms occurred in 8.1% of affected patients. Development of ischemic events was significantly associated with older patients (≥60 years; p=0.038). Routine use of platelet function assays and newer P2Y12 receptor inhibitors (ticagrelor) were not associated with fewer thromboembolic events. CONCLUSIONS Thromboembolic events are relatively common after treatment with a PED with an incidence comparable to stent-assisted and conventional coiling but the risk of neurological morbidity from ischemic burden is low. Older patients are at particularly increased risk of thromboembolic events.","Brasiliense, Leonardo B C; Stanley, Morgan A; Grewal, Sanjeet S; Cloft, Harry J; Sauvageau, Eric; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Miller, David; Kallmes, David F; Hanel, Ricardo",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,155,1

We evaluated the effect of early application of prone positioning on outcomes in patients with severe ARDS. METHODS In this multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we randomly assigned 466 patients with severe ARDS to undergo prone-positioning sessions of at least 16 hours or to be left in the supine position. Severe ARDS was defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of less than 150 mm Hg, with an FiO2 of at least 0.6, a positive end-expiratory pressure of at least 5 cm of water, and a tidal volume close to 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died from any cause within 28 days after inclusion. RESULTS A total of 237 patients were assigned to the prone group, and 229 patients were assigned to the supine group. The 28-day mortality was 16.0% in the prone group and 32.8% in the supine group (P<0.001). The hazard ratio for death with prone positioning was 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.63). Unadjusted 90-day mortality was 23.6% in the prone group versus 41.0% in the supine group (P<0.001), with a hazard ratio of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.67). The incidence of complications did not differ significantly between the groups, except for the incidence of cardiac arrests, which was higher in the supine group. CONCLUSIONS In patients with severe ARDS, early application of prolonged prone-positioning sessions significantly decreased 28-day and 90-day mortality.

In 1977, Webster proposed preserving a little triangle in the beginning of the lower lateral osteotomy line to prevent breathing problem. However, its importance is still controversial. OBJECTIVES and methods: This prospective randomized controlled study (level of evidence 1) included 46 patients without nasal breathing problem. High-to-low (Webster's triangle preservation) osteotomy (control group, n = 23) and low-to-low osteotomy (study group, n = 23) were performed. All operations were performed according to the proposed volumetric rhinoplasty steps (examination/measurement, prevention and treatment). Nasal obstruction symptom evaluation (NOSE) test, visual analog scale, acoustic rhinometry, rhinomanometry, peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF), and three-dimensional measurements were performed in all patients. Breathing tests were repeated before and 6 months after surgery with and without xylometazoline administration. RESULTS No statistically significant difference in NOSE and visual analog scale scores was found between the two groups. Acoustic rhinometry, PNIF, and rhinomanometry findings showed no statistically significant breathing difference between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS In reduction rhinoplasties, a decrease in the internal volume may be expected as directly proportional with the reduction amount. The decrease in the internal volume may create nasal breathing problems. To prevent it, nasal airflow should be adjusted according to new anatomy. In this study, we discussed ""volumetric rhinoplasty"" steps to prevent breathing problems in reduction rhinoplasty. Following these steps, not preserving Webster's triangle (low-to-low osteotomy) has no effect on the nasal airway.

Although the molecular consequences of SUMO attachment are difficult to predict, the underlying principle of SUMOylation is altering inter- and/or intramolecular interactions of the modified substrate, changing localization, stability, and/or activity. Unsurprisingly, many different pathogens have evolved to exploit the cellular SUMO modification system due to its functional flexibility and far-reaching functional downstream consequences. Although the extensive knowledge gained so far is impressive, a definitive conclusion about the role of SUMO modification during virus infection in general remains elusive and is still restricted to a few, yet promising concepts. Based on the available data, this review aims, first, to provide a detailed overview of the current state of knowledge and, second, to evaluate the currently known common principles/molecular mechanisms of how human pathogenic microbes, especially viruses and their regulatory proteins, exploit the host cell SUMO modification system.","Wimmer, Peter; Schreiner, Sabrina; Dobner, Thomas",Journal of virology,155,16

In order to identify viruses associated with BRD, we used a metagenomics approach to enrich and sequence viral nucleic acids in the nasal swabs of 50 young dairy cattle with symptoms of BRD. Following deep sequencing, de novo assembly, and translated protein sequence similarity searches, numerous known and previously uncharacterized viruses were identified. Bovine adenovirus 3, bovine adeno-associated virus, bovine influenza D virus, bovine parvovirus 2, bovine herpesvirus 6, bovine rhinitis A virus, and multiple genotypes of bovine rhinitis B virus were identified. The genomes of a previously uncharacterized astrovirus and picobirnaviruses were also partially or fully sequenced. Using real-time PCR, the rates of detection of the eight viruses that generated the most reads were compared for the nasal secretions of 50 animals with BRD versus 50 location-matched healthy control animals. Viruses were detected in 68% of BRD-affected animals versus 16% of healthy control animals. Thirty-eight percent of sick animals versus 8% of controls were infected with multiple respiratory viruses. Significantly associated with BRD were bovine adenovirus 3 (P < 0.0001), bovine rhinitis A virus (P = 0.005), and the recently described bovine influenza D virus (P = 0.006), which were detected either alone or in combination in 62% of animals with BRD. A metagenomics and real-time PCR detection approach in carefully matched cases and controls can provide a rapid means to identify viruses associated with a complex disease, paving the way for further confirmatory tests and ultimately to effective intervention strategies. IMPORTANCE Bovine respiratory disease is the most economically important disease affecting the cattle industry, whose complex root causes include environmental, genetics, and infectious factors. Using an unbiased metagenomics approach, we characterized the viruses in respiratory secretions from BRD cases and identified known and previously uncharacterized viruses belonging to seven viral families. Using a case-control format with location-matched animals, we compared the rates of viral detection and identified 3 viruses associated with severe BRD signs. Combining a metagenomics and case-control format can provide candidate pathogens associated with complex infectious diseases and inform further studies aimed at reducing their impact.","Ng, Terry Fei Fan; Kondov, Nikola O; Deng, Xutao; Van Eenennaam, Alison; Neibergs, Holly L; Delwart, Eric",Journal of virology,155,1

METHODS Sixty young (20-30 year), middle-aged (31-65 year) and elderly (66-80 year) patients were included (n = 20, each group). Five minutes following the start of continuous intravenous administration of remifentanil at 0.25 μg/kg/min, general anaesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.8 mg/kg to facilitate tracheal intubation. Infusion of remifentanil was stopped immediately after tracheal intubation. When BIS began to increase > 60, maintenance of anaesthesia was started with an end-tidal desflurane concentration of 4.0% and maintained for 10 min followed by 1-min assessment of BIS taken at 10-s intervals. MACBIS 50 of each age group was estimated by up-down methodology. RESULTS MACBIS 50 of desflurane in young, middle-aged and elderly patients was 4.25% end-tidal (95% confidence intervals 4.04-4.46), 3.58% (3.38-3.79) and 2.75% (2.50-3.00) respectively. MACBIS 50 was higher (P = 0.011) in young patients and lower (P = 0.012) in elderly patients than those in middle-aged patients. CONCLUSIONS Advance in age significantly decreased the concentrations of desflurane required to maintain BIS below 50.

Strikingly, DENV-4 replication peaked earlier and promoted stronger innate immune responses, with increased expression of DC activation and migration markers and increased cytokine production, compared with DENV-2. In addition, infected DCs produced higher levels of inflammatory cytokines compared with bystander DCs, which mainly produced IFN-induced cytokines.

The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment has recently been suggested to influence HSC aging, however the mechanisms whereby BM stromal cells mediate this effect is unknown. Here we show that aging-associated decreased expression of CXCR4 expression on BM mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) plays a crucial role in the development of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) aging phenotype. The BM MSC from old mice was sufficient to drive a premature aging phenotype of young HSPC when cultured together ex vivo. The impaired ability of old MSC to support HSPC function is associated with reduced expression of CXCR4 on BM MSC of old mice. Deletion of the CXCR4 gene in young MSC accelerates an aging phenotype in these cells characterized by increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, senescence, and reduced proliferation. Culture of HSPC from young mice with CXCR4 deficient MSC also from young mice led to a premature aging phenotype in the young HSPC, as evidenced by reduced hematopoietic regeneration and enhanced myeloid differentiation. Mechanistically, CXCR4 signaling prevents BM MSC dysfunction by suppressing oxidative stress, as treatment of old or CXCR4 deficient MSC with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), improved their niche supporting activity, and attenuated the HSPC aging phenotype. Our studies suggest that age-associated reduction in CXCR4 expression on BM MSC impairs hematopoietic niche activity with increased ROS production, driving an HSC aging phenotype. Thus, modulation of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in MSC may lead to novel interventions to alleviate the age-associated decline in immune/hematopoietic function.","Singh, Pratibha; Kacena, Melissa A; Orschell, Christie M; Pelus, Louis M",Stem cell reviews and reports,155,1

The continued expansion of this type of work has led to precarious employment as a recognized category within social determinants of health work and to a growing literature within public health research. African-American men are disproportionately vulnerable to precarious work, which in turn contributes to adverse health effects. Nevertheless, African-American men's experiences of employment and the perceived impact on their well-being remain underexplored. This study was part of the formative exploratory phase of a 5-year community-based participatory research project to examine the biopsychosocial determinants of stress among low/no-income, African-American men.

This study is a retrospective review of 209 percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon disruption and 1304 over-the-wire catheter exchange procedures performed in 753 patients. Approval from the Human Investigations Committee was obtained for this study. Up to 10-year follow-up was performed. A χ(2) test was used to compare the rates of central venous stenosis after balloon disruption versus catheter exchange. A t-test was used to compare time to central venous stenosis development. Of the 753 patients in the study, 127 patients underwent balloon disruption of fibrin sheath and 626 had catheter exchange. Within the balloon disruption group, 18 (14.2%) of 127 patients subsequently developed central venous stenosis, compared with 44 (7.0%) of 626 in the catheter exchange group (P < 0.01, χ(2) test). Time to central venous stenosis development was approximately 3 years in both groups and not significantly different (1371 and 1010 days, P = 0.20). A total of 25.2% of patients in the balloon disruption group had four or more subsequent catheter exchanges, versus 12.6% in the catheter exchange group (P < 0.01, χ(2) test). In conclusions, there is a possible association between percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon disruption of fibrin sheath and late-onset central venous stenosis. Because venography was not routinely performed in catheter exchange patients, future randomized studies are necessary to confirm these findings.","Ni, Nina; Mojibian, Hamid; Pollak, Jeffrey; Tal, Michael",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,155,16

The implicit assumption of partial equilibrium within both the health sector itself and--if a wider perspective is adopted--the economy as a whole would be violated by such emergencies. We propose an alternative, with the specific aim of accounting for the behavioural changes and capacity problems that are expected to occur when such an outbreak strikes.","Beutels, P; Edmunds, W J; Smith, R D",Health economics,155,16

As is well known, friction is a complex nonlinear phenomenon. It appears that classical or static models are unable to capture some of the observations made in systems subjected to significant frictional effects. In needle insertion, translational friction would be a matter of importance when the needle is very flexible, or a stop-and-rotate motion profile at low insertion velocities is implemented, and thus, the system is repeatedly transitioned from a pre-sliding to a sliding mode and vice versa. In order to characterize friction components, a distributed version of the LuGre model in the state-space representation is adopted. This method also facilitates estimating cutting force in an intra-operative manner. To evaluate the performance of the proposed family of friction models, experiments were conducted on homogeneous artificial phantoms and animal tissue. The results illustrate that our approach enables us to represent the main features of friction which is a major force component in needle-tissue interaction during needle-based interventions.","Asadian, Ali; Patel, Rajni V; Kermani, Mehrdad R",Annals of biomedical engineering,155,1

Here, we argue that the hero narrative in itself need not be problematic, but highlight a number of wider factors that have led to the initial rise (and subsequent fall) in support for labelling frontline workers as heroes. Through our related work, we have gathered similar stories from frontline workers where they feel betrayed, let down or otherwise short-changed by the hero label, and we have sought to make sense of this through understanding more about how the hero label is used rather than what it means. In this article, we propose a way forward where there is greater discussion around the hero label in this context where individuals can be heroes but still struggle, still fail and still feel vulnerable, and where heroism is viewed as a state of interdependence between heroic actor and the wider group. It is true that heroes can inspire, lead, guide and build morale and camaraderie, but collective responsibility is held with us all. We can draw hope and energy from our heroes, but we must dig deep and be proactive, particularly in the face of adversity. In doing so, we support the heroes to lead from the front and ensure that even though we cannot physically help; we are not making their situation worse.","Kinsella, Elaine L; Sumner, Rachel C",Journal of medical ethics,155,28

Methods A scoping review of PubMed, Scopus, and Embase was conducted through March 1, 2021. Studies examining the effect of the incorporation of either deliberate practice and/or mastery learning during resuscitation education were eligible for inclusion. Included studies were dichotomized into studies comparing deliberate practice and/or mastery learning to other training methods (randomized controlled trials) and studies examining before and after impact of deliberate practice and/or mastery learning alone (observational studies). Studies and findings were tabulated and summarized using the scoping review methodology published by Arksey and O'Malley. Results 63 published studies were screened; sixteen studies met all inclusion criteria (4 randomized controlled trials and 12 observational studies). One randomized controlled trial and eleven observational studies demonstrated improvement in skill and/or knowledge following educational interventions using deliberate practice and/or mastery learning. Significant variability between studies with regard to research designs, learner groups, comparators, and outcomes of interest made quantitative summarization of findings difficult. Conclusions The incorporation of deliberate practice and/or mastery learning in resuscitation education may be associated with improved educational outcomes and less skill decay than other educational methods. Current literature on DP and ML suffers from a lack of consistency in research methodology, subjects, and outcomes. Future research should employ uniform definitions for deliberate practice and mastery learning, follow research design that isolates its effect, and examine generalizable and translatable outcomes.","Donoghue, Aaron; Navarro, Kenneth; Diederich, Emily; Auerbach, Marc; Cheng, Adam",Resuscitation plus,155,20

DESIGN A convenience sample was drawn of 243 Israeli registered nurses. A structured self-administered questionnaire collected data on (a) intention to report for work, (b) barriers preventing nurses from reporting for work, (c) perceived self-efficacy in emergency conditions, (d) risk appraisal of health hazards, (e) knowledge of nurses' roles in emergency work, (f) access to institutional support services, and (g) reporting to work in a past emergency. METHODS Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficients, t tests, and multiple regression analysis. FINDINGS Less than half of the nurses who said they had been asked to report for work in a past emergency had actually done so. The major barrier to reporting for work was childcare demands. There was a significant correlation between perceived knowledge, risk appraisal, self-efficacy, and intention to report. Self-efficacy, risk appraisal, working through an earlier emergency, perceived knowledge, and full or part-time working altogether. CONCLUSIONS Personal factors, such as perceived knowledge, risk appraisal, and self-efficacy, are more important to Israeli nurses than objective barriers in preventing them from reporting for emergency work. The level of perceived knowledge as to the demands on and duties of nurses in a large-scale emergency is low. Self-efficacy enhancing activities need to be introduced into nurse training for emergency preparedness. CLINICAL RELEVANCE This study makes an important contribution to research on the importance of perceived self-efficacy in the context of disaster planning.","Melnikov, Semyon; Itzhaki, Michal; Kagan, Ilya",Journal of nursing scholarship : an official publication of Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing,155,5

Pinpointing which genes and genomic regions are underlying phenotypic variability thus helps to understand the processes of acclimation and adaptation. We used Daphnia as a system to identify candidates playing a role in phenotypic variation related to a predation risk environment with a genome-wide association approach. Furthermore, a gene co-expression network analysis allowed identifying clusters of co-expressed genes which correlated to life history traits. To enhance the understanding of the functional roles of the transcripts, we identified orthologs and paralogs from related species and used ontologies to annotate the candidates of interest. Our study revealed that only one life history trait and two morphometric traits have a genetic association in the presence of predation risk (fish kairomones), while most genotype-phenotype associations were detected in a genotype-environment interaction analysis for reproduction-related phenotypic traits. The gene co-expression network analysis identified a total of 44 modules, of which one module correlated to another life history trait namely the 'total number of broods'. The combined use of gene co-expression network and transcriptome-wide association analysis allowed the identification of 131 candidate transcripts associated to life history traits in Daphnia galeata. These results lay the ground for targeted studies to further understand phenotypic variability in this species.","Ravindran, Suda Parimala; Tams, Verena; Cordellier, Mathilde",Journal of evolutionary biology,155,1

Previous studies used income and education to measure SES, the NLS enables us to include wealth as well. Previous studies also used cross-sectional data, whereas the NLS allows us to examine whether changes in income and wealth correlate with changes in SSB intake. The results indicate an inverse gradient in SSB consumption with respect to both income and wealth, controlling for education. However, we do not find evidence that changes in income and wealth correlate with changes in SSB intake. This finding suggests that SES influences the development of SSB consumption patterns, but changes in income and wealth generally do not alter them in adulthood.","Zagorsky, Jay L; Smith, Patricia K",Economics and human biology,155,30

Methods: E-survey of MAiD stressors (n = 33) and protective factors (n = 27); resilience measurement and comments relating to practice involving physicians and nurse practitioners who provide MAiD services and belong to the Canadian Association of MAiD Assessors and Providers or a francophone equivalent. The survey was conducted, while Parliament was considering changes to MAiD eligibility criteria, which occurred during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Results: In total, there were 131 respondents (response rate 35.8%). Two possible changes to future eligibility (mental disorders as the sole reason for MAiD and mature minors) were highly scored as were extra clinical load and patients' family conflict over MAiD. Twenty percent of respondents considered stopping MAiD work. The CD Resilience Scale-2 mean score was 6.90. Highly scored protective factors included compassionate care, relief of suffering, patient autonomy, patient gratitude, feelings of honor, privilege, and professionally satisfying work. Discussion: The identified stressors and reasons for considering stopping MAiD work indicate needs for policy, education, and supports to be optimized or developed. Respondents showed high resilience and highly scored protective factors, which should be optimized. This survey should be repeated in countries where MAiD is legal to determine stressors and protective factors in MAiD practice, stressors addressed, and protective factors enhanced where feasible in the local context for optimal care.","Stewart, Donna E; Viens, Pierre; Muralidharan, Oviya; Kastanias, Patti; Dembo, Justine; Riazantseva, Ekaterina",Journal of palliative medicine,155,33

METHODS This prospective study included 35 female patients, 34 multiparous and one nulliparous, with an average age of 47.5 years (range 31-67 years), rectocele grade II (n = 13/37.1%) or grade III (n = 22/62.9%), associated with RMP. The study parameters included ODS, constipation, functional continence scores and pre- and postoperative cinedefecographic findings. RESULTS The average preoperative ODS score, the constipation score and the functional continence score were significantly reduced after surgery from 10.63 to 2.91 (p = 0.001), 15.23 to 4.46 (p = 0.001) and 2.77 to 1.71 (p = 0.001), respectively. Between the first and the eighth postoperative day, the average visual analog scale pain score fell from 5.23 to 1.20 (p = 0.001). Satisfaction with treatment outcome was 79.97, 86.54, 87.65 and 88.06 at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. Cinedefecography revealed average reductions in rectocele size from 19.23 ± 8.84 mm (3-42) to 6.68 ± 3.65 mm (range 0-7) at rest and from 34.89 ± 12.30 mm (range 20-70) to 10.94 ± 5.97 mm (range 0-25) during evacuation (both P = 0.001).

The role of viral infections during infancy is, however, less known, although early infancy is thought to be a crucial period for CF disease development.We prospectively assessed symptomatic and asymptomatic viral detection in the first year of life in infants with CF and healthy controls. METHODS In a prospective cohort study, we included 31 infants with CF from the Swiss Cystic Fibrosis Infant Lung Development Cohort and 32 unselected, healthy infants from the Basel Bern Infant Lung Development Cohort and followed them throughout the first year of life. Respiratory symptoms were assessed by weekly telephone interviews. Biweekly nasal swabs were analysed for 10 different viruses and two atypical bacteria with real-time seven duplex PCR (CF=561, controls=712). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS Infants with CF and healthy controls showed similar numbers of swabs positive for virus (mean 42% vs 44%; OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.26, p=0.6). Virus-positive swabs were less often accompanied by respiratory symptoms in infants with CF (17% vs 23%; OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.95, p=0.026). This finding was pronounced for symptomatic human rhinovirus detection (7% vs 11%; OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.9, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS Viral detection is not more frequent in infants with CF and respiratory symptoms during viral detection occur even less often than in healthy controls. It is likely an interplay of different factors such as local epithelial properties and immunological mechanisms that contribute to our findings.","Korten, Insa; Kieninger, Elisabeth; Klenja, Shkipe; Mack, Ines; Schläpfer, Njima; Barbani, Maria Teresa; Regamey, Nicolas; Kuehni, Claudia E; Hilty, Markus; Frey, Urs; Gorgievski, Meri; Casaulta, Carmen; Latzin, Philipp",Thorax,155,20

The understanding of ITP pathogenesis is rapidly evolving. We now recognize ITP as a complex and heterogeneous syndrome that results from a combination of humoral and cell-mediated attacks on platelets peripherally and megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. Autoantibody-mediated ITP also varies in the pathway used to clear platelets, which depends on the platelet glycoprotein being targeted. Moreover, ITP patients present with variable bleeding severities and treatment responses that do not closely correlate with platelet count. A gold standard diagnostic test for ITP is lacking, and biomarkers to assess disease severity are in their infancy. This review provides an update on the immunopathogenesis of ITP and summarizes currently available tests for ITP diagnosis, prediction of disease severity, and treatment responses.

Dural suture watertightness is a decisive issue, and neurosurgeons routinely use different products to reinforce their dural closure. We have designed an experimental system capable of testing CSF leak pressure levels in order to compare two types of sutures in vitro and particularly four different sealants. METHODS Twenty-five fresh human cadaveric dural samples were removed and prepared for testing in a pressure chamber system connected to a hydraulic pressure motor. CSF leak levels were objectively registered. First, simple interrupted stitches were compared to running simple closure on 50-mm linear suture. Secondly, four sealants (two sealants/glues, Bioglue®, Duraseal®; two haemostatics, Tachosil®, Tissucol®) were tested. Statistical analysis was performed with paired Student's t-test. RESULTS No significant difference between interrupted closure and running suture was observed (p = 0.079). All sealants increased the watertightness of the suture significatively. However, comparison of the means of the differences for each product revealed large variations. In the conditions of our experiment, one sealant (Duraseal®) and one haemostatic (Tachosil®) seemed to show better results. We observed two different types of leakage: at the dura-sealant interface and through the sealant itself. CONCLUSIONS We have developed an experimental device capable of testing dural closure watertightness. Interrupted stitch suturing seemed no different from running simple closure. On the contrary, the sealants tested show different watertightness capacities.","Chauvet, Dorian; Tran, Viet; Mutlu, Gurkan; George, Bernard; Allain, Jean-Marc",Acta neurochirurgica,155,1

Due to its intrinsic ability to generate highly reactive species under mild conditions by anodic oxidation or cathodic reduction, electrosynthesis is particularly interesting for otherwise challenging transformations. One such challenge is the installation of fluorinated alkyl groups, which has gained significant attention in medicinal chemistry and material science due to their unique physicochemical features. Unsurprisingly, several electrochemical fluoroalkylation methods have been established. In this review, we survey recent developments and established methods in the field of electrochemical mono-, di-, and trifluoromethylation, and perfluoroalkylation of small organic molecules.","Kisukuri, Camila M; Fernandes, Vitor A; Delgado, José A C; Häring, Andreas P; Paixão, Márcio W; Waldvogel, Siegfried R",Chemical record,155,27

Each was assessed regarding time-to-ventilate (primary outcome) and rating of difficulty handling the device. RESULTS In 86% (standard protection) and 85% (PPE) of attempts, airway management was achieved in <60 seconds, irrespective of the device used. In the PIU setting, only 69% of attempts succeeded within this time frame (P<.05). Median time-to-ventilate was shorter for standard protection (23 seconds) and PPE (25 seconds) compared to the PIU (38 seconds; P<.001). In the PIU setting, the fiberscope took the longest (median, 170 seconds), while i-gel was the quickest (median, 13 seconds). The rating of difficulty (visual analogue scale [VAS], 0-100) differed significantly between the isolation scenarios: Airway management was most difficult with PIU (VAS, 76), followed by PPE (VAS, 35), and standard protection (VAS, 9) (P<.01). CONCLUSION Wearing PPE produced similar times-to-ventilate as standard protection among anesthesiologists, but it was subjectively rated more difficult. The portable isolation unit permitted acceptable times-to-ventilate when excluding fiberscope and cricothyrotomy. Supraglottic airway devices allowed the fastest airway management in all isolation scenarios, thus being highly recommendable if a portable isolation unit is used and emergency airway management becomes necessary.

The aim of the study was to analyze the results of a systematic home pulse oximetry (S pO2 ) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide (P tcCO2 ) monitoring in stable pediatric subjects on long-term CPAP/NIV or screened for CPAP/NIV weaning, and the consequent interventions in the subjects with abnormal gas exchange. METHODS The home overnight S pO2 and P tcCO2 recordings of stable pediatric subjects treated with or weaned from CPAP, NIV, or high-flow nasal cannula between January 2017 and March 2018 were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 110 recordings, performed in 79 subjects, median age 6 (interquartile range [IQR] 1.5-14) y, were analyzed. Fifty-two recordings (47%) were performed during NIV, 43 (39%) during CPAP, 2 (2%) during high-flow nasal cannula, and 13 (12%) during a spontaneous ventilation weaning trial from ventilatory support. The quality of recording was excellent in 81% of recordings, 5 recordings (5%) had <4 h of recording time, 5 (5%) had artifacts on the S pO2 signal, and 16 (15%) had artifacts on the P tcCO2 signal. Gas exchange abnormalities were observed in 11 subjects with P tcCO2 > 50 mm Hg during ≥ 2% of recording time (n = 8), mean P tcCO2 ≥ 50 mm Hg (n = 6), mean P tcCO2 < 35 mm Hg (n = 3), and S pO2 < 90% during ≥ 2% of recording time (n = 2). Consequent interventions were (multiple interventions possible): change of device settings (n = 6), change of interface (n = 2), switched to high-flow nasal cannula (n = 1), and a control recording (n = 2).

Conversely, aerobic exercise acutely lowers the blood pressure up to 25 h post exercise. However, it is unknown if this beneficial effect also apply for workers exposed to high levels of OPA. Cleaners constitute a relevant occupational group for this investigation because of a high prevalence of OPA and cardiovascular disease. Accordingly, the objective was to investigate the acute effects on ambulatory blood pressure from a single aerobic exercise session among female cleaners. METHODS Twenty-two female cleaners were randomised to a cross-over study with a reference and an aerobic exercise session. Differences in 24-h, work hours, leisure time, and sleep ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) were evaluated using repeated measure 2 × 2 mixed-models. RESULTS After the aerobic exercise session, the 24-h systolic ambulatory blood pressure was significantly lowered by 2.4 mmHg (p < 0.01) compared to the reference session. The 24-h diastolic ABP was unaltered. During work hours, a lowered systolic ABP of 2.2 mmHg (p = 0.02) and a higher diastolic ABP of 1.5 mmHg (p = 0.03) were found after the aerobic exercise session. During leisure time, the systolic ABP was lowered by 1.7 mmHg (p = 0.04) and the diastolic ABP was unaltered. During sleep, the systolic and diastolic ABP was unaltered. CONCLUSION A single aerobic exercise session lowered 24-h systolic ABP of 2.4 mmHg. Thus, an aerobic exercise session seems to be beneficial for lowering the risk of hypertension among cleaners.","Lund Rasmussen, Charlotte; Nielsen, Line; Linander Henriksen, Marie; Søgaard, Karen; Krustrup, Peter; Holtermann, Andreas; Korshøj, Mette",European journal of applied physiology,155,5

Here, we applied density functional theory calculations to study the Al-doping effect on the sensitivity of a ZnO nanosheet to HCHO gas, explaining the experimental results. We found that the pristine ZnO nanosheet weakly interacts with the HCHO with adsorption energy (Ead) of -9.3 kcal/mol, and the sensing response (S) value of 2.2 at 623 K. After the Al-doping process, the Ead and S values increase to -40.7 kcal/mol and 83.9, respectively, indicating an excellent agreement with the experimental results. We showed a relation between the HOMO-LUMO gap and the S value, confirming with the experimental results. Also, the proposed Al-doped ZnO nanosheet shows a good selectivity to HCHO gas at the presence of H2, NH3, C2H5OH, CO, and CH4 gases. A short recovery time of 18 s is predicted for Al-ZnO-based sensor which is comparable with the experimental value of 26 s. Finally, we conclude that the Al-doping makes the ZnO nanosheet a promising HCHO gas sensor with a high sensitivity, an excellent selectivity, and short recovery time.","Fang, Yu; Yang, Dong Dong; Xiang, Cai Yun; Shi, Min; Zhao, Huan; Asadi, H",Journal of molecular graphics & modelling,155,12

They also exhibit an unusual bipolar morphology comprised of a classical soma-proximal dendritic zone and an elongated secretory process that can operate as both a dendrite and an axon, termed a 'dendron'. We show using expansion microscopy that the highest density of synaptic inputs to a GnRH neuron exists at its distal dendron. In vivo, selective chemogenetic inhibition of the GnRH neuron distal dendron abolishes the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge and markedly dampens LH pulses. In contrast, inhibitory chemogenetic and optogenetic strategies targeting the GnRH neuron soma-proximal dendritic zone abolish the LH surge but have no effect upon LH pulsatility. These observations indicate that electrical activity at the soma-proximal dendrites of the GnRH neuron is only essential for the LH surge while the distal dendron represents an autonomous zone where synaptic integration drives pulsatile GnRH secretion.","Wang, Li; Guo, Wenya; Shen, Xi; Yeo, Shel; Long, Hui; Wang, Zhexuan; Lyu, Qifeng; Herbison, Allan E; Kuang, Yanping",eLife,155,27

These measures have generated lifestyle changes with potential effects on individuals' health. The disturbances in daily routines due to confinement and remote work have impacted circadian rhythms and energy balance; however, the consequences of these disruptions have not been studied in depth. The objective was to evaluate the impact of 12-week confinement on body weight, considering changes in several external synchronizers of the biological clock. METHODS The participants, 521 university students (16-35 years), responded to 52 questions oriented to determine light exposure, sleep patterns, sedentary lifestyle, and eating times. RESULTS We found a reduction in sunlight exposure and sleep duration, an increment in sedentarism and screen exposure, and a delay in the timing of the main meals and sleep in the whole cohort. These behavioral changes were associated with a twofold increase in obesity. Subjects who increased their sedentary hours and shortened their sleep to a higher degree were those who gained more bodyweight. The most influential factors in body weight variation during confinement were sleep duration, physical activity (sedentarism), and light (timing of screen exposure). The mediation model explained 6% of the total body weight variation. CONCLUSIONS Results support a significant impact of confinement on several external synchronizers of the biological clock and on body weight. Health-related recommendations during the pandemic must include behavioral recommendations to mitigate the adverse effects on the biological clock.","Baquerizo-Sedano, Luis; Chaquila, José A; Aguilar, Luis; Ordovás, José M; González-Muniesa, Pedro; Garaulet, Marta",Clinical nutrition,155,33

This study is a hypothesis-generating first-in-human study to assess feasibility, and to provide preliminary efficacy and safety data. METHODS AND RESULTS Eligible patients had a baseline office systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg (or ≥150 mmHg for diabetics) and were on two or more antihypertensive medications. Nine patients were enrolled. The primary endpoint, the insertion of the OneShot balloon into each renal artery and the delivery of radiofrequency energy, was achieved in 8/9 (89%) of patients. The one failure (the first patient) was due to generator high-impedance safety shut-off threshold set too low for humans. Adverse events were minor. No patient developed renal artery stenosis. Baseline BP was 185.67 ± 18.7 mmHg and the reductions at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months were 30.1 ± 13.6 (p=0.0004), 34.2 ± 20.2 (p=0.002), 33.6 ± 32.2 (p=0.021) and 30.6 ± 22.0 (p=0.019).

Small case series have been reported in the literature but few studies with a large number of patients have been published. We present our experience with the SFD for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms in Canada. METHODS Centers across Canada using SFDs were contacted to fill out a case report form for patients treated with an SFD in their center. Individual centers were responsible for approval from their ethics committee. Image analysis was performed by individual operators. The case report forms were collected and the final analysis was performed. RESULTS A total of 92 patients were treated with SFDs in eight centers in Canada between January 2009 and August 2013. The aneurysms were located in the posterior circulation in 16 patients and in the anterior circulation in 76 patients. Most aneurysms (75%) were saccular in shape; 22% were fusiform and 3% were blister aneurysms. The size of the aneurysms varied from 2 to 60 mm with the neck varying from 2 to 60 mm. Perioperative morbidity and mortality were 8.7% and 2.2%, respectively. At the last available follow-up, 83.1% of the aneurysms were either completely or near-completely occluded. The rate of complications was higher for fusiform aneurysms (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The SFD appears to be an important tool for the treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms. Treatment outcomes and complication rates remain a problem, but should be considered in the context of available alternative interventions.

The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of silymarin (SLM) against DTX-induced central and peripheral neurotoxicities in rats. Rats received 25 and 50 mg/kg body weight SLM orally for seven consecutive days after receiving a single injection of 30 mg/kg body weight DTX on the first day. SLM significantly decreased brain lipid peroxidation level and ameliorated brain glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities in DTX-administered rats. SLM attenuated levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and activity of p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38α MAPK) whereas caused an increase in levels of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in the brain and sciatic nerve of DTX-induced rats. In addition, SLM improved the histological structure of the brain and sciatic nerve tissues and decreased the expression of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the sciatic nerve whereas increased cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) expression in the brain induced by DTX. Additionally, SLM markedly up-regulated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and downregulated the expression of Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) in the brain and sciatic nerve tissues of DTX-induced rats. Our results show that SLM can protect DTX-induced brain and sciatic nerve injuries by enhancing the antioxidant defense system and suppressing apoptosis and inflammation.","Yardım, Ahmet; Kucukler, Sefa; Özdemir, Selçuk; Çomaklı, Selim; Caglayan, Cuneyt; Mehmet Kandemir, Fatih; Çelik, Hamit",Gene,155,19

Early detection and proper intervention have a paramount role in alleviating the shattering long-term effects. The clinical presentation of neonatal hip septic arthritis is very non-specific, with limited movement of the extremities and excessive crying during manipulations such as diaper changing. Our case was a 17-day-old male newborn who presented to our hospital after a family noticed decreased left leg movement and crying while changing diapers for 5 days, with the associated complaint of holding the left leg in a flexed position. The newborn then underwent all the available investigations and the diagnosis of hip septic arthritis was made. We were stunned by the culture result, which isolated Klebsiella pneumonia from the sample that had been taken from joint fluid, which is a very unusual isolate. Conclusion Hip septic arthritis is an orthopedic emergency, especially in neonates. It should be considered in newborns presenting with pseudoparalysis as the presentation is non-specific. Considering a less common microorganism with culture and sensitivity is very important, especially if the response to treatment is delayed. We endorse proper workup and timely intervention as hip arthritis has a poor prognosis when the management is delayed.","Nigussie, Bezaye; Eifa, Aberash; Tagesse, Bereketab; Ketema, Worku",International medical case reports journal,155,1

METHODS Forty patients with ASA I-II physical status, who were scheduled for elective laparoscopic (group I) or open abdominal surgery (group II) were enrolled in the study. Tracheal intubation was always performed by an experienced anesthesiologist. The endotracheal tube cuff was inflated with air through a 10-ml syringe. The cuff was connected to a manometer. The endotracheal cuff pressure was registered every 5 min after tracheal intubation. At the time of discharge from the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) and 12 h after tracheal extubation, patients were asked about their laryngotracheal condition by an independent observer who was uninformed of the patient allocation groups. We investigated laryngotracheal complaints such as sore throat, dysphasia, and hoarseness. RESULTS The endotracheal cuff pressures in group I were significantly higher than those in the group II at all time points studied (P < 0.05). The endotracheal cuff pressures exceeded the critical pressure of 30 cmH(2)O after 5 min in the group I (intra-abdominal pneumoperitoneum was started). The incidence of sore throat was higher in group I than in group II in the PACU and at 12 h. CONCLUSION This study indicates that the CO(2) pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg position used during laparoscopy increase endotracheal cuff pressure and lead to discomfort in the postoperative patient. Measurement of endotracheal cuff pressure is a simple and inexpensive procedure and should be applied in patients under going laparoscopic surgery.","Yildirim, Zeynep Baysal; Uzunkoy, Ali; Cigdem, Ali; Ganidagli, Suleyman; Ozgonul, Abdullah",Surgical endoscopy,155,1

The limitations could be attributed to the complexity of the reconstruction procedures under laparoscopic observation and the high incidence of complications. Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) has been regarded traditionally as the most frequent major complication and is a potentially serious and life-threatening event. It remains the single most important cause of morbidity after PD and contributes significantly to prolonged mortality. Several modified methods of pancreas anastomosis were introduced to prevent POPF. However, few methods with a satisfactory leakage rate have yet to be seen. Collating principle of theoretical mechanics, we introduce a new method of reconstruction by performing an asymmetric sleeving-joint pancreaticojejunostomy (SJPJ). The aim of this study is to summarize the results of a new technique that is designed to decrease the POPF. METHODS From January 2004 to December 2010, SJPJ was performed on 86 patients undergoing PD by 1 surgeon: a laparoscopic reconstruction was completed in 9 cases, a hand-assisted laparoscopic reconstruction in 2 cases, and an open SJPJ reconstruction in 75 cases. DISCUSSION We used SJPJ, an asymmetric pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ). The time of operation ranged from 300 minutes to 640 minutes. Postoperatively there were no major morbidities and no deaths. Although POPF was observed in the laparoscopic SJPJ group with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 3 patients developed POPF in the open SJPJ group with ampullary adenocarcinoma (n=1) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n=2). The POPF rate was 9.30% in the open SJPJ group and 9.10% in the laparoscopic SJPJ group. The SJPJ procedure facilitates PJ, both laparoscopically and in open surgery. It is safe, effective, and feasible in experience hands.","Lei, Zhao; Zhifei, Wang; Jun, Xu; Chang, Liu; Lishan, Xu; Yinghui, Guan; Bo, Zhai",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,155,17

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the infusion of a small volume of HES may provide benefits in systemic and regional hemodynamics and metabolism in a brain-dead canine model compared with large volume crystalloid resuscitation. METHODS Fourteen mongrel dogs were subjected to a brain-death protocol by consecutive insufflations of a balloon catheter in the epidural space. One hour after induction of brain-death, the animals were randomly assigned to two groups: NS (0.9% NaCl, 33 mL/kg), and HES (6%HES 450/0.7, 17 mL/Kg). Systemic and regional hemodynamics were evaluated using Swan-Ganz, ultrasonic flowprobes, and arterial catheters. Serial blood samples were collected for blood gas, electrolyte, and serum chemistry analysis. Systemic, hepatic, and splanchnic O(2)-derived variables were also calculated. RESULTS Epidural balloon insufflations induced a significant increase in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output (MAP and CO, respectively), regional blood flow, and systemic vascular resistance. Following the hyperdynamic phase, severe hypotension with normalization of systemic and regional blood flow was observed. Fluid resuscitation induced a prompt increase in MAP, CO, and portal vein blood flow, and a significant reduction in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. There were no differences between groups in metabolic indices, liver function tests (LFTs), or renal function tests. HES was more effective than NS in restoring cardiac performance in the first 2h after fluid resuscitation (P < 0.05). Both tested solutions partially and temporarily restored systemic and regional oxygen delivery. CONCLUSION Small volumes of 6% HES 450/0.7 improved cardiovascular performance and provided the same regional hemodynamic and metabolic benefits of large volumes of isotonic crystalloid solutions.","De Luca, Fabio A; Garrido, Alejandra Gallardo; Prist, Ricardo; Gutierrez, Paulo Sampaio; Rocha-e-Silva, Mauricio; Cruz, Ruy J",The Journal of surgical research,155,1

These achievements inspired investigators and pharmaceutical companies to conduct clinical trials in patients with early-stage NSCLC because both adjuvant and neoadjuvant platinum-based doublet chemotherapies (PT-DCs) showed only a 5% improvement in 5-year overall survival. IMpower010, a phase 3 trial (P3), showed that adjuvant PT-DC followed by maintenance atezolitumab significantly prolonged disease-free survival over adjuvant PT-DC alone (hazard ratio, 0.79; stage II to IIIA). Since conventional therapies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, can promote immunogenic cell death, releasing tumour antigens from dead tumour cells, ICI combination therapies with conventional therapies are widely proposed. The Checkmate 816 trial (P3) indicated a significantly higher pathological complete response rate of neoadjuvant nivolumab/PT-DC combination therapy than of neoadjuvant PT-DC alone (odds ratio, 13.9, for stage IB to IIIA). Detection of circulating tumour DNA is highly anticipated for the evaluation of minimal residual disease. Multimodal approaches and new ICI agents are being attempted to improve the efficacy of ICI treatment in phase 2 trials. This review presents the development of perioperative treatment using ICIs in patients with NSCLC while discussing problems and perspectives.","Soh, Junichi; Hamada, Akira; Fujino, Toshio; Mitsudomi, Tetsuya",Cancers,155,31

Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are mainly known to cause infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract but the symptoms may also involve the nervous and digestive systems. Since the beginning of December 2019, there has been an epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, which was originally referred to as 2019-nCoV. The most common symptoms are fever and cough, fatigue, sputum production, dyspnea, myalgia, arthralgia or sore throat, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea (30%). The best prevention is to avoid exposure. In addition, contact persons should be subjected to mandatory quarantine. COVID-19 patients should be treated in specialist centers. A significant number of patients with pneumonia require passive oxygen therapy. Non-invasive ventilation and high-flow nasal oxygen therapy can be applied in mild and moderate non-hypercapnia cases. A lung-saving ventilation strategy must be implemented in acute respiratory distress syndrome and mechanically ventilated patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a highly specialized method, available only in selected centers and not applicable to a significant number of cases. Specific pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 is not currently available. Modern medicine is gearing up to fight the new coronavirus pandemic. The key is a holistic approach to the patient including, primarily, the use of personal protective equipment to reduce the risk of further virus transmission, as well as patient management, which consists in both quarantine and, in the absence of specific pharmacological therapy, symptomatic treatment.","Dzieciatkowski, Tomasz; Szarpak, Lukasz; Filipiak, Krzysztof J; Jaguszewski, Milosz; Ladny, Jerzy R; Smereka, Jacek",Cardiology journal,155,26

Nonetheless, diagnosis in this context it is occasionally challenging. We sought to evaluate the kinetics and diagnostic accuracy of the new biomarker « heart-type fatty acid-binding protein » (h-FABP) in the early detection of myocardial injury in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, compared with classical biomarkers. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective study was conducted on 17 consecutive patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting during a 2 month period. Blood samples were drawn for measurement of myocardial ischemic injury biomarkers (h-FABP, troponin, creatine kinase [CK] and CK-MB), at baseline (T1), immediate post-coronary artery bypass grafting (T2), on ICU admission (T3), and after 4 (T4), 8 (T5), 24 (T6) and 48 h (T7). Perioperative ischemic complications, defined according to electrocardiographic, echocardiographic and hemodynamic criteria, were recorded. RESULTS Earlier biomarkers peak plasma values occurred at T4 with troponin (2.9 ± 5.2 ng/mL), and at T5 with h-FABP (37.9 ± 55.5 ng/mL). Maximum values of CK and CK-MB occurred later, both in T6 (741 ± 779 and 37 ± 51 U/L, respectively). The optimized cut-off obtained for h-FABP was 19 ng/mL, providing a sensitivity and specificity of 77 and 75%, respectively, for diagnosis of perioperative ischemic injury, with an area under the ROC curve for h-FABP of 0.83 (95% CI 0.6-1.0) vs. 0.63 (95% CI 0.33-0.83) for troponin. This cut-off value for h-FABP is reached on average at T2 (mean value of h-FABP at T2: 18.9 ± 21.5 ng/mL). CONCLUSION This is the first study evaluating the kinetics of h-FABP biomarker in perioperative off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, and the cut-off value established could help to extend earlier detection of myocardial ischemia in this context.","Carmona, P; Mateo, E; Montoro, A; Alós, L; Coret, M; Errando, C L; Llagunes, J; De Andrés, J",Revista espanola de anestesiologia y reanimacion,155,17

Although sub-types of neurons have been defined, the heterogeneity of cell populations in peripheral nerves, especially Schwann cells, has not been well demonstrated. Here, we collected sciatic nerves (SN) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from neonatal (1-day old) rats and classified cell populations by high-coverage single-cell sequencing. A total of 10 types of cells, including endothelial cells, erythrocytes, fibroblasts, monocytic cells, neurons, neutrophils, pericytes, satellite cells, Schwann cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells, were identified by transcriptome-based cell typing. The comparisons of cells in neonatal rat SN and DRG revealed distinct atlas in different tissue localizations. Investigations of ligand-receptor interactions showed that there existed direct cell-cell communications between endothelial cells and fibroblasts in SN and among endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and vascular smooth muscle cells in DRG. Schwann cells in neonatal rats were further sub-grouped to four sub-types, including LOC100134871 and Hbb expressing Schwann cell sub-type 1, Cldn19 and Emid1 expressing Schwann cell sub-type 2, Timp3 and Col5a3 expressing Schwann cell sub-type 3, and Cenpf and Mki67 expressing Schwann cell sub-type 4. These Schwann cell sub-types exhibited distinct genetic features and functional enrichments.

We demonstrated previously that UL24 of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is important for the dispersal of nucleolin from nucleolar foci throughout the nuclei of infected cells. Furthermore, the N-terminal portion of UL24 localizes to nuclei and can disperse nucleolin in the absence of any other viral proteins. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that highly conserved residues in UL24 are important for the ability of the protein to modify the nuclear distribution of nucleolin. We constructed a panel of substitution mutations in UL24 and tested their effects on nucleolin staining patterns. We found that modified UL24 proteins exhibited a range of subcellular distributions. Mutations associated with a wild-type localization pattern for UL24 correlated with high levels of nucleolin dispersal. Interestingly, mutations targeting two regions, namely, within the first homology domain and overlapping or near the previously identified PD-(D/E)XK endonuclease motif, caused the most altered UL24 localization pattern and the most drastic reduction in its ability to disperse nucleolin. Viral mutants corresponding to the substitutions G121A and E99A/K101A both exhibited a syncytial plaque phenotype at 39 degrees C. vUL24-E99A/K101A replicated to lower titers than did vUL24-G121A or KOS. Furthermore, the E99A/K101A mutation caused the greatest impairment of HSV-1-induced dispersal of nucleolin. Our results identified residues in UL24 that are critical for the ability of UL24 to alter nucleoli and further support the notion that the endonuclease motif is important for the function of UL24 during infection.","Bertrand, Luc; Leiva-Torres, Gabriel André; Hyjazie, Huda; Pearson, Angela",Journal of virology,155,26

Subjects had dysphagia secondary to prior treatment for head/neck cancer or from neurologic injury. All subjects demonstrated clinical and fluoroscopic evidence of oropharyngeal dysphagia. No subject withdrew during the course of this study. INTERVENTIONS All subjects completed 3 weeks of an intensive, exercise-based dysphagia therapy. Therapy was conducted daily for 1h/d, with additional activities completed by subjects each night between therapy sessions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcomes were clinical and functional change in swallowing performance with maintenance at 3 months after intervention. Secondary, exploratory outcomes included physiological change in swallow performance measured by hyolaryngeal elevation, lingual-palatal and pharyngeal manometric pressure, and surface electromyographic amplitude. RESULTS Clinical and functional swallowing performances improved significantly and were maintained at the 3-month follow-up examination. Subject perspective (visual analog scale) on functional swallowing also improved. Four of 7 subjects who were initially feeding tube dependent progressed to total oral intake after 3 weeks of intervention.

Tens of millions of people have been confirmed infection, and more people are suspected. Chest computed tomography (CT) is recognized as an important tool for COVID-19 severity assessment. As the number of chest CT images increase rapidly, manual severity assessment becomes a labor-intensive task, delaying appropriate isolation and treatment. In this paper, a study of automatic severity assessment for COVID-19 is presented. Specifically, chest CT images of 118 patients (age 46.5±16.5 years, 64 male and 54 female) with confirmed COVID-19 infection are used, from which 63 quantitative features and 110 Radiomics features are derived. Besides the chest CT image features, 36 laboratory indices of each patient are also used, which can provide complementary information from a different view. A random forest (RF) model is trained to assess the severity (non-severe or severe) according to the chest CT image features and laboratory indices. Importance of each chest CT image feature and laboratory index, which reflects the correlation to the severity of COVID-19, is also calculated from the RF model. Using three-fold cross-validation, the RF model shows promising results: 0.910 (true positive ratio), 0.858 (true negative ratio) and 0.890 (accuracy), along with AUC of 0.98. Moreover, several chest CT image features and laboratory indices are found to be important to COVID-19 severity, which could be valuable for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.","Tang, Zhenyu; Zhao, Wei; Xie, Xingzhi; Zhong, Zheng; Shi, Feng; Liu, Jun; Shen, Dinggang",Physics in medicine and biology,155,26

BACKGROUND Poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) biodegradable stents have been shown to be effective in the coronaries, but no data are available regarding their efficacy in the femoral artery. METHODS A prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized study enrolled 30 patients with symptomatic de novo SFA disease undergoing implantation of Igaki-Tamai bioresorbable stents. Clinical examinations and duplex ultrasound were prospectively performed after 1, 6, 9, and 12 months. The main study endpoints were technical success, restenosis rate, rate of target lesion revascularization (TLR), changes in ankle-brachial index (ABI), and quality of life by evaluating the walking impairment questionnaire (WIQ). Safety was assessed by monitoring the occurrence of major adverse clinical events and serious adverse events. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 67.7 years, and 77% were male. The mean lesion length was 5.9 cm. Mean diameter stenosis was reduced from 89.9% to 6.2%, after stent implantation. Technical success was 96.7%. Binary restenosis rate for the 6 and 12 months follow-up was 39.3% and 67.9%, respectively. The TLR rate was 25.0% after 6 months and 57.1% after 12 months. All TLR were successful; the secondary patency rate after 1 year was 89.3%. Between baseline and 12 months, ABI increased in 53.6% of patients. Functional endpoints (WIQ), even if affected by a relatively high reintervention rate, showed improvement in most of the patients. CONCLUSIONS The GAIA (Evaluation of the Biodegradable Peripheral Igaki-Tamai Stent in the Treatment of De Novo Lesions in the Superficial Femoral Artery) study shows that when using biodegradable PLLA stents (Igaki-Tamai), the immediate angiographic results are comparable to the results of metal stents, achieving a high secondary patency rate after 1 year. Modifications of stent characteristics and technical modifications are needed with the goal to reduce the restenosis rate during the reabsorption period.","Werner, Martin; Micari, Antonio; Cioppa, Angelo; Vadalà, Giuseppe; Schmidt, Andrej; Sievert, Horst; Rubino, Paolo; Angelini, Annalisa; Scheinert, Dierk; Biamino, Giancarlo",JACC.

Of the 217 patients, 123 (57%) had a drain left in situ at the end of the operation. RESULTS The two cohorts of patients were not significantly different in their demographics. The use of a drain was significantly associated with an increased number of fibroids (4.6±3.8 vs. 2.8±2.1, p<0.0001), increased weight of fibroids (277±211 g vs. 133±153 g, p<0.0001), increased surgical time (133±40 min vs. 90±35 min, p<0.0001) and increased estimated blood loss (406±265 ml vs. 199±98 ml, p<0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference in length of hospital stay (mean duration of admission 2.1 days±0.98 with drain, vs. 2.1 days±0.97 without a drain, p=0.98). CONCLUSION We conclude that although the use of a drain may be associated with a more complex operation, this does not delay the patient's discharge.","Hurrell, Alice; Oliver, Reeba; Agarwal, Nilesh; Rouabhi, Schahrazed; Odejinmi, Funlayo","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",155,27

METHODS This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in a referral medical centre in Taiwan. Only premature infants with no ROP, stage 1 ROP or stage 2 ROP were enrolled. Overall, 11 372 retinal fundus images were compiled and split into 10 235 images (90%) for training, 1137 (10%) for validation and 244 for testing. A deep CNN was implemented to classify images according to the ROP stage. Data were collected from December 17, 2013 to May 24, 2019 and analysed from December 2018 to January 2020. The metrics of sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were adopted to evaluate the performance of the algorithm relative to the reference standard diagnosis. RESULTS The model was trained using fivefold cross-validation, yielding an average accuracy of 99.93%±0.03 during training and 92.23%±1.39 during testing. The sensitivity and specificity scores of the model were 96.14%±0.87 and 95.95%±0.48, 91.82%±2.03 and 94.50%±0.71, and 89.81%±1.82 and 98.99%±0.40 when predicting no ROP versus ROP, stage 1 ROP versus no ROP and stage 2 ROP, and stage 2 ROP versus no ROP and stage 1 ROP, respectively.

However, primary care's different population and processes result in under-recognised, unintended consequences. Testing performs poorer in primary care, with indication creep due to earlier, more undifferentiated presentation and reduced accuracy due to spectrum bias and the 'false-positive paradox'. In low-prevalence settings, tests without near-100% specificity have their useful yield eclipsed by greater incidental or false-positive findings. Ensuing cascades and multiplier effects can generate clinician workload, patient anxiety, further low-value tests, referrals, treatments and a potentially nocebic population 'disease' burden of unclear benefit. Increased diagnostics earlier in pathways can burden patients and stretch general practice (GP) workloads, inducing downstream service utilisation and unintended 'market failure' effects. Evidence is tenuous for reducing secondary care referrals, providing patient reassurance or meaningfully improving clinical outcomes. Subsequently, inflated investment in per capita testing, at a lower level in a healthcare system, may deliver diminishing or even negative economic returns. Test cost poorly represents 'value', neglecting under-recognised downstream consequences, which must be balanced against therapeutic yield. With lower positive predictive values, more tests are required per true diagnosis and cost-effectiveness is rarely robust. With fixed secondary care capacity, novel primary care testing is an added cost pressure, rarely reducing hospital activity. GP testing strategies require real-world evaluation, in primary care populations, of all downstream consequences. Test formularies should be scrutinised in view of the setting of care, with interventions to focus rational testing towards those with higher pretest probabilities, while improving interpretation and communication of results.","Sajid, Imran Mohammed; Frost, Kathleen; Paul, Ash K",BMJ evidence-based medicine,155,1

Mounting evidence supports the effectiveness and safety of this treatment for female sexual dysfunction. A newly developed vaginal tactile imaging (VTI) technique accurately evaluates the biomechanical parameters of the female pelvic floor and vagina, including tissue elasticity, pelvic support, and pelvic muscle function in high definition. In the current study, we evaluated changes in objective biomechanical parameters using VTI, following vaginal CO2 laser treatment for vaginal tightening and sexual dysfunction. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort between June 2018 and January 2020. Inclusion criteria were vaginal looseness, decreased local sensation during sexual intercourse, and sexual dysfunction. All the participants were treated with a vaginal carbon dioxide laser. They underwent a gynecological evaluation based on the Vaginal Health Index (VHI) and sexual function assessment according to the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Vaginal biomechanical parameters were assessed by VTI. Initial evaluations were performed at the pre-treatment consult visit, 1 week prior to the first treatment and at a 6-month post-treatment follow-up visit. RESULTS Twenty-five women were included in the final analysis. Compared with baseline, the post-treatment mean scores for vaginal elasticity and tightening were higher (54.8 ± 5.2 vs. 41.5 ± 6.3, P = 0.0027 and 1.97 ± 0.25 vs. 1.32 ± 0.31, P = 0.0014, respectively). Post-treatment increases were demonstrated in pelvic muscle contraction strength (25.9 ± 3.5 vs. 16.5 ± 4.2, P = 0.0011) and in reflex pelvic muscle contraction (2.93 ± 0.44 vs. 2.12 ± 0.47, P = 0.0022); the mean FSFI and VHI scores were higher following treatment (28.47 ± 1.73 vs. 21.12 ± 1.58, P = 0.036 and 19.15 ± 1.27 vs. 11.6 ± 0.97, P = 0.0032).

A more complete understanding of the complex cellular events required for successful nerve regeneration may reveal new therapeutic targets. The role of fibroblasts in regeneration, and the process by which the nerve reforms its three-dimensional structure after a transection injury, are not fully understood. The Hedgehog signaling pathway has been shown to mediate nerve sheath formation during development. We therefore sought to characterize the role of Hedgehog-responsive cells following transection of the facial nerve. METHODS Two transgenic mouse lines with reporters for the downstream effector of Hedgehog signaling, Gli1, were used. The animals underwent a unilateral facial nerve transection injury, and the contralateral side served as a control. Facial nerves were analyzed via immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence at predetermined time points as the facial nerve regenerated after the transection injury. RESULTS There was a statistically significant increase in Gli1+ cells both at the site of injury and within the distal nerve segment over time. Gli1+ cells are fibroblasts within the nerve and appear to contribute to the reformation of the nerve sheath after injury. CONCLUSION These findings describe a key signaling pathway by which fibroblasts participate in motor nerve regeneration. Fibroblasts that reside within the nerve respond to injury and may represent a novel therapeutic target in the context of facial nerve regeneration after transection injury.","Bobarnac Dogaru, Gabriela L; Juneja, Subhash C; Shokrani, Alireza; Hui, Roseanne Y; Chai, Yang; Pepper, Jon-Paul",Experimental neurology,155,1

METHODS Piglets from hyperprolific sows born with signs of asphyxia, (n=109; <6 on a score of respiration, meconium staining and activity) or very low birth weight (VLBW; n=112; <1.05 kg) were selected for the study. Approximately half of each group (n=55 VLBW piglets and n= 57 piglets with asphyxia) received 100% oxygen immediately after birth using a specially designed facemask for 45 seconds (VLBW) or 1 minute (asphyxiated). Physiological parameters (peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) blood glucose concentration and rectal temperature) were measured before oxygen treatment 5 minutes after birth (SpO2) and 24 hours later (SpO2, blood glucose concentration, temperature). Weight at birth, at 24 hours and at 21 days of age, preweaning mortality, and estimated colostrum intake were also recorded. RESULTS A significant treatment effect on SpO2 was observed (p=0.013 and p<0.001 for VLBW and asphyxiated piglets respectively). VLBW and asphyxiated piglets that received oxygen treatment had higher SpO2 after treatment (measured 5 minutes after birth, 97.7 and 97.8% respectively) compared to immediately after birth (93.3 and 86.8% respectively) while untreated piglets showed no variation. Blood glucose concentrations increased in all piglets between birth and 24 hours of age (p=0.003 and p<0.001 for asphyxiated and VLBW piglets respectively) and this was higher in asphyxiated piglets that received oxygen than those that did not (5.6 (SE 0.2) mmol/L; p<0.05). Estimated colostrum intake was higher in asphyxiated (401.6 (SD 24.4) g/kg) and VLBW (374.9 (SE 23.4 g/kg) piglets that received oxygen than those that did not (273.2 (SE 24.1) g/kg; p<0.001 and 249.0 (SE 22.5) g/kg; p<0.001 respectively). Similarly weight at weaning was higher in asphyxiated (5.8 (SE 0.2) kg) and VLBW (4.9 (SE 0.2) kg) piglets that received oxygen therapy than control animals (4.9 (SE 0.2) kg;=0.005 and 4.1 (SE 0.2) kg; p=0.008 respectively). Furthermore, oxygen treatment markedly reduced preweaning mortality from 9/52 (17%) untreated to 1/57 (1.7%) oxygen-treated piglets suffering asphyxia at birth (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS Oxygen therapy improves physiological and productive parameters in piglets born with signs of asphyxia or VLBW. The incorporation of this strategy as part of the farrowing routine enhances the advantages of rearing hyperprolific sows.","Soraci, A L; Decundo, J M; Dieguez, S N; Martinez, G; Romanelli, A; Perez Gaudio, D S; Fernandez Paggi, M B; Amanto, F A",New Zealand veterinary journal,155,24

As an indication of the heterogeneity of ARDS, there are patients whose syndrome improves rapidly (i.e., within 24 hours), others whose hypoxemia improves gradually and still others whose severe hypoxemia persists for several days. The latter group of patients with persistent severe ARDS poses challenges to clinicians. We attempted to assess the baseline characteristics and outcomes of persistent severe ARDS and to identify which variables are useful to predict it. METHODS A secondary analysis of patient-level data from the ALTA, EDEN and SAILS ARDSNet clinical trials was conducted. We defined persistent severe ARDS as a partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2:FiO2) of equal to or less than 100 mmHg on the second study day following enrollment. Regularized logistic regression with an L1 penalty [Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)] techniques were used to identify predictive variables of persistent severe ARDS. RESULTS Of the 1531 individuals with ARDS alive on the second study day after enrollment, 232 (15%) had persistent severe ARDS. Of the latter, 100 (43%) individuals had mild or moderate hypoxemia at baseline. Usage of vasopressors was greater [144/232 (62%) versus 623/1299 (48%); p<0.001] and baseline severity of illness was higher in patients with versus without persistent severe ARDS. Mortality at 60 days [95/232 (41%) versus 233/1299 (18%); p<0.001] was higher, and ventilator-free (p<0.001), intensive care unit-free [0 (0-14) versus 19 (7-23); p<0.001] and non-pulmonary organ failure-free [3 (0-21) versus 20 (1-26); p<0.001] days were fewer in patients with versus without persistent severe ARDS. PaO2:FiO2, FiO2, hepatic failure and positive end-expiratory pressure at enrollment were useful predictive variables. CONCLUSIONS Patients with persistent severe ARDS have distinct baseline characteristics and poor prognosis. Identifying such patients at enrollment may be useful for the prognostic enrichment of trials.","Sanchez, Elizabeth; Price, David R; Chung, Kuei-Pin; Oromendia, Clara; Choi, Augustine M K; Schenck, Edward J; Siempos, Ilias I",PloS one,155,1

Surgery for prostate cancer, which has high morbidity, is performed with an increasing momentum based on the successful oncological and functional outcomes as well as cosmetic aspects. MATERIALS AND METHODS 62 patients underwent robot-assisted perineal radical prostatectomy (R-PRP) surgery at our clinic between November 2016 and August 2017. Six pelvimetric dimensions were defined and measured by performing multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) prior to operation in all patients. In light of these data, we aimed to investigate the effect of pelvimetric measurements on surgery duration and surgical margin positivity. RESULTS By using this technique in pelvic area, we observed that measurements only representing surgical site and excluding other pelvic organs had a significant effect on surgery duration, and pelvic dimensions had no significant effect on surgical margin positivity. CONCLUSION In R-PRP technique, peroperative findings and oncological outcomes can vary depending on several variable factors, but although usually not taken into account, pelvimetric measurements can also affect these outcomes. However, there is a need for randomised controlled trials to be conducted with more patients.","Yenice, Mustafa Gurkan; Yigitbasi, Ismail; Turkay, Rustu; Sahin, Selcuk; Tugcu, Volkan",International braz j urol : official journal of the Brazilian Society of Urology,155,29

Greater surveillance of underage use is necessary to inform e-cigarette policy and mitigate adolescent e-cigarette use. Accurate prevalence estimates for adolescent e-cigarette use are provided by large national surveys. However, these surveys are costly and provide only annual estimates. To obtain more affordable estimates faster and more frequently, novel methods are required. Methods: Online search term popularity data were taken from Google Trends. Interest in the search terms ""vapes"", ""vape"", and ""vape pen"" were followed monthly from January 2011 to November 2020. Time-lagged zero-normalized cross-correlations were performed between the Google data and current (past 30 day) high-school e-cigarette use prevalence estimates from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS). The search interest data were then calibrated to the NYTS data to estimate adolescent e-cigarette use prevalence using online searches. Results: Maximum correlation coefficients of 0.979 for ""vapes"" and 0.938 for ""vape"" were obtained when search interest lagged use prevalence by one month, and 0.970 for ""vape pen"" when the lag was two months (p<0.0001 for all). Calibrating the search term data to NYTS provided a high-school current e-cigarette use prevalence estimate of 11.3-16.5% for November 2020, suggesting adolescent use of e-cigarettes has continued to decline since the NYTS estimate of 19.6% for January-March 2020. Conclusions: Online search trend data may provide reasonably reliable and more frequent estimates of adolescent e-cigarette use prevalence at substantially lower costs than traditional surveys. Such additional data may help in developing adolescent e-cigarette use prevention efforts.","Foxon, F.",,155,5

Using a controlled money-burning task, we elicited hostile behavior among a nationally representative sample (n = 2,186) in the Czech Republic during the first wave of the pandemic. We provide evidence that exogenously elevating the salience of the Covid-19 crisis increases hostility against foreigners from the EU, USA and Asia. This behavioral response is similar across various demographic sub-groups. Further, we observe zero to small negative effects for both domestic out-groups and in-groups, suggesting that the salience of Covid-19 might negatively affect behavior not only towards foreigners but to other people more generally, though these findings are not conclusive. The results underscore the importance of not inflaming anti-foreigner sentiments and suggest the need to monitor impacts of the crisis on behavior in the social domain.","Bartoš, Vojtěch Bauer Michal Cahlíková Jana Chytilová Julie",European Economic Review,155,1

The secondary aim was to estimate the promptness of contact tracing. Methods: A population-based analysis of surveillance data of all COVID-19 cases occurring in RE, Italy, from September 1, 2020, to April 4th, 2021, for which a school contact and/or exposure was suspected. Indicator of the delay in contact tracing was computed as the time elapsed since positivity of the index case and the date on which the swab for classmates was scheduled (or most were scheduled). Results: Overall, 30,426 and 13,571 contacts among classmates and teachers/staff, respectively, were identified and received recommendation for testing; 43,414 (98.7%) performed the test.

This study aims to report the implementation of active distance learning during the pandemic era in Indonesia. The main challenge in this implementation is seeking the trade-off between the achievement of student outcomes and the existing resources. Three active learning approaches are already implemented, i.e. smartphone-based measurement;circuit simulation;and course project. The implementation of these active learnings has considered the students' existing resources, like smartphones, computers, and microcontrollers. These active learning approaches are a complement to lecture-based learning. It can be used to improve the students' competencies. Furthermore, students are more active and take more initiative, particularly during course project implementation. This study has shown that the active learning approach still can be implemented during home-based learning while retaining the student outcomes achievement. © 2021 IEEE.","Setiawan, A.

This pandemic is having devastating effects on societies and economies around the world. The increase in the number of COVID-19 tests gives more information about the epidemic spread, which may lead to the possibility of surrounding it to prevent further infections. However, wearing a face mask that prevents the transmission of droplets in the air and maintaining an appropriate physical distance between people, and reducing close contact with each other can still be beneficial in combating this pandemic. Therefore, this research paper focuses on implementing a Face Mask and Social Distancing Detection model as an embedded vision system. The pretrained models such as the MobileNet, ResNet Classifier, and VGG are used in our context. People violating social distancing or not wearing masks were detected. After implementing and deploying the models, the selected one achieved a confidence score of 100%. This paper also provides a comparative study of different face detection and face mask classification models. The system performance is evaluated in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, support, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy that demonstrate the practical applicability. The system performs with F1-score of 99%, sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 99%, and an accuracy of 100%. Hence, this solution tracks the people with or without masks in a real-time scenario and ensures social distancing by generating an alarm if there is a violation in the scene or in public places. This can be used with the existing embedded camera infrastructure to enable these analytics which can be applied to various verticals, as well as in an office building or at airport terminals/gates.

More precisely, it has become a question of Green for whom? While many of the impacts of supposed green energy projects are local in their reach, some may be more regional in their scope, such as hydroelectric power. Hydroelectric power generation negatively impacts the environment and people who rely on the environment for sustenance, such as, Indigenous peoples of northern Canada. Taking into account their position with respect to the areas impacted by these green projects, many Indigenous peoples have voiced their concerns and doubts concerning green energy, which is purported to be a mode of energy production that champions the environment. The Kabinakagami River Waterpower Project serves as a case study for both the potential effects of the project and the different views associated with these endeavors. If nothing else, the accounts and testimonies found within shall stand as a testament to the hubris of calling an energy project green without properly assessing and considering the impacts. While these statements relate to the case presented, they also carry significance in the wider world due to the numerous Indigenous communities around the world that are having their spaces slowly being encroached upon in the name of sustainable growth, or green energy.

To examine whether interactions between EBOV polymerase and cellular and viral factors affect distinct viral RNA synthesis events, we applied proximity proteomics to define the cellular interactome of EBOV polymerase, under conditions that recapitulate viral transcription and replication. We engineered EBOV polymerase tagged with the split-biotin ligase split-TurboID, which successfully biotinylated the proximal proteome while retaining polymerase activity. We further analyzed the interactomes in an siRNA-based, functional screen and uncovered 35 host factors, which, when depleted, affect EBOV infection. We validated one host factor, eukaryotic peptide chain release factor subunit 3a (eRF3a/GSPT1), which we show physically and functionally associates with EBOV polymerase to facilitate viral transcription termination. Our work demonstrates the utility of proximity proteomics to capture the functional host-interactome of the EBOV polymerase and to illuminate host-dependent regulations of viral RNA synthesis.","Fang, Jingru; Pietzsch, Colette; Tsaprailis, George; Crynen, Gogce; Cho, Kelvin Frank; Ting, Alice Y.; Bukreyev, Alexander; Carlos de la Torre, Juan; Saphire, Erica Ollmann",bioRxiv,155,1

Belief in conspiracy theory has been hypothesized to predict the degree of adherence to quarantine restrictions (wearing protective equipment, isolation, hygiene) and influences antisocial behavior such as aggression and selfishness, as well as prosocial behavior such as help and altruism. The obtained data of the empirical research indicate the absence of functional connections that could demonstrate the defining role of conspiracy mindset in the manifestations of prosocial and asocial behavior;however, there is still a statistical consistency of changes in indicators. Also, preventive behavior was practically not associated with the personality's conspiracy belief about COVID-19 (the regression equation explains less than 1% of the variance).

The most common zoonotic dermatophytes are Microsporum canis, Nannizzia gypsea and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Wood’s lamp examination, microscopic identification and fungal culture are the main conventional diagnostic methods used in clinics. Less common methods are dermatophyte PCR and biopsy/histopathology. However, these methods also have limitations for providing both accuracy and timely on-site detection. The recent development of CRISPR-based diagnostic platform provides the possibility of a rapid, accurate, and portable diagnostic tool, which has huge potential for clinical applications. Objectives The purpose of this study is to establish a molecular method for rapid and accurate diagnosis of clinical dermatophytes, which can accelerate clinical diagnostic testing and help timely treatment. Methods In this paper, we design a Cas12a-based assay combined with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) to differentiate three main zoonotic dermatophytes. The limit of detection (LOD) is determined by using standard strains. A total of 25 clinical samples (hair and scurf) are identified to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of this assay. Results The RPA-Cas12a method showed high sensitivity and specificity (100% and 100%, respectively). The results could be observed directly by naked-eyes, and all tested samples were consistent with fungal culture and sequencing results. Conclusions Compared with other methods, the RPA-Cas12a-fluorescence assay requires less time (30 minutes) and less complicated equipment, and visible changes can be clearly observed, which is suitable for on-site clinical diagnosis.","Wang, Liyang; Fu, Jinyu; Cai, Guang; Zhang, Di; Shi, Shuobo; Zhang, Yueping",bioRxiv,155,32

Here, participants chose between selfish and costly generous options in two conditions: in the gain frame, a generous choice yielded a gain to the other; in the loss frame, it entailed preventing the loss of a previous endowment to the other. Social discounting was reduced in the loss compared to the gain frame, implying increased generosity toward strangers. Using neuroimaging tools, we found that while the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) subserved generosity in the gain frame, the insular cortex was selectively recruited during generous choices in the loss frame. We provide support for a network-model according to which TPJ and insula differentially promote generosity by modulating value signals in the VMPFC in a frame-dependent fashion. These results extend our understanding of the insula role in nudging prosocial behavior in humans.","Sellitto, Manuela; Neufang, Susanne; Schweda, Adam; Weber, Bernd; Kalenscher, Tobias",bioRxiv,155,1

However, such spillover risks are difficult to quantify. As climate change is rapidly transforming environments, it is becoming critical to quantify the potential for spillovers, in an unbiased manner. For this, we resorted to a metagenomics approach, and focused on two environments in the High Arctic, soil and lake sediments from Lake Hazen. We used DNA and RNA sequencing to reconstruct the lake’s virosphere and its range of eukaryotic hosts, and show that spillover risk is higher in lake sediments than in soil and increased with runoff from glacier melt - a proxy for climate change. Should climate change also shift species range of potential vectors northwards, the High Arctic could become fertile ground for emerging pandemics.","Lemieux, Audrée; Colby, Graham A.; Poulain, Alexandre J.; Aris-Brosou, Stéphane",bioRxiv,155,1

This coagulopathy may be due to a severe pro-inflammatory state (cytokine storm) and/or by viral sepsis. This can sometimes lead to consumption coagulopathy and decreased platelet count, leading to increased risk of bleeding and may manifest like hematomas in atypical locations. These bleeding manifestations may be spontaneous or can be induced by even minor trauma. Cases: It is a single-center retrospective analysis. Four patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 depicting increased risk of bleeding manifestations were included. Patients in our study were managed as per guidelines recommended by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Directorate General of Health Services, Government of India. Results: All patients were male. The mean age was 56 +/- 18.64 years. One patient was managed conservatively with discontinuation of anticoagulants, volume resuscitation, and transfusion of blood products. Drainage with incision was done for 2 patients. One was managed with pigtail drainage. Conclusion: The effect of anticoagulants given in therapy and their varied presentations are discussed in this article.

It is however important to document the increasingly multimodal technological world that young children are inhabiting. Framed by socio-cultural and ecological theoretical perspectives, this case study of a 4-year old girl investigates how the contexts surrounding the child impact the use of digital technologies and the differences, if any, between the two contexts. Participatory methods are used to gather data from the child participant in relation to her experiences, preferences and interactions with technology, which was triangulated with the views of one parent and her current educator. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. Four themes emerged as follows: technological uses and competences, child agency and participation, individual and collective funds of knowledge and bridging of children's lifeworlds. Findings indicated that the differences or digital disconnect between the home and the school are not necessarily perceived as negative or limiting, yet there is also room for fluidity and openness to explore these technological spaces as possibilities or bridges for children's participation, engagement and agency in the two lifeworlds. Practitioner notes What is already known about the topic The notion of digital disconnect between the home and the school characterises children's encounters with technology. Learning is culturally, historically and socially situated, and a result of participation and immersion in the cultural milieu through the mediation of social and cultural tools. What this paper adds Empirical evidence of young children's experiences of their multimodal lifeworlds through case study research. Understanding of a young child's perceptions on the use of digital technologies in the home and the school from her own lens using participatory methods with children. Realisation that at age 4, a child may already have developed clear distinctions between formal and informal spaces.

In 2019, Covid-19 was announced as a pandemic disease and categorized as a public health emergency globally. It is ranked as the sixth most serious pandemic internationally. This pandemic tracking and analysis require an appropriate method that gives better performance in terms of accuracy, precision and recall that defines its pattern since it involves huge and complicated datasets from the pandemic. Pattern identification is currently applied in many instances due to the rapid growth of data besides having the potential to generate a knowledge-rich environment which can help to significantly improve the quality of clinical decisions and identify the relationships between data items. Therefore, there is a need to review the techniques in data mining on the pandemic outbreak that focuses on healthcare. The goal of this study was to analyze the algorithms from the data mining method that had been implemented for pandemic outbreaks in past research such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and Covid-19. The result shows that 2 main algorithms, namely Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree, from the classification method, are appropriate algorithms and give more than 90% accuracy in both the pandemic and healthcare.

However, the multidimensional nature of structural racism is not captured by existing measures used by population health scholars to study health inequities. Multidimensional measures can be made using complex analytical techniques. Whether or not the multidimensional measure of structural racism provides more insight than the existing unidimensional measures is unknown. Methods We derived measures of Black-White residential segregation, inequities in education, employment, income, and homeownership, evaluated for 2,338 Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) in the United States (US), and consolidated them into a multidimensional measure of structural racism using a latent class model. We compared the median COVID-19 vaccination rates observed across 54 New York City (NYC) PUMAs by levels (high/low) of structural racism and the multidimensional class using the Kruskal-Wallis test. This study was conducted in March 2021. Findings Our latent class model identified three structural racism classes in the US, all of which can be found in NYC. We observed intricate interactions between the five dimensions of structural racism of interest that cannot be simply classified as “high” (i.e., high on all dimensions of structural racism), “medium,” or “low.” Compared to Class A PUMAs with the median rate of two-dose completion of 6·9%, significantly lower rates were observed for Class B PUMAs (5·5%, p = 0·04) and Class C PUMAs (5·2%, p = 0·01). When the vaccination rates were evaluated based on each dimension of structural racism, significant differences were observed between PUMAs with high and low Black-White income inequity only (7·2% vs. 5·3%, p = 0·001). Interpretation Our analysis suggests that measuring structural racism as a multidimensional determinant of health provides additional insight into the mechanisms underlying population health inequity vis-à-vis using multiple unidimensional measures without capturing their joint effects.

However, little is known about levels of knowledge and personal use of psychedelic mushroom(s) (PM) among American adults. Methods: We examined PM use and various measures of health status, quality of life and self-reported mental health outcome measures obtained through a national on-line, cross-sectional survey of adults with a demographic composition representative of the US adult population by region, gender, age, and race (weighted N = 251,297,495) from November 2020-March 2021. Results: General mental health and well-being was a popular reason for PM use (63.6%). PM users were less likely to be overweight than non-users, but overall quality of life (VR-12) was lower for mental health (39.5 vs 45.5). PM users reported significantly higher levels of anxiety (GAD-7 scores of 9.6 vs 5.9) and depression (PHQ-9 scores of 11.2 vs 6.8). They were less likely to have health insurance [OR=0.50 (0.35-0.72)], but reported significantly more healthcare services utilization. Discussion and Conclusions: There is a mismatch between our findings of an association between PM use and poor mental health outcomes, and current discourse on the positive health benefits of PM consumption. A significant number of Americans are already self medicating with PM and further research to understand the role of anecdotal knowledge and pseudoscientific information in PM uptake. There is an urgent need for a PM use-related national harm reduction strategy.","Matzopoulos, R.; Morlock, R.; Morlock, A.; Lerer, B.; Lerer, L. B.",,155,16

Analyzing global discourse across vast corpora, we reveal an exceptional rise in global ‘mortality salience’ (awareness of death), and trace the socio-political dynamics feeding it. Comparing governmental pandemic policies worldwide, we introduce a novel model discerning ‘mortality mitigation’ (coping mechanisms) on a scale from steadfast resistance (‘oak’) to flexible resilience (‘reed’). We find that political trust, high median age, and social anxiety predict a reedy approach;and that the oak, typically pushing for stricter measures, better mitigates mortality. Stringency itself, however, hardly affects Covid-related cases/deaths. We enrich our model with brief illustrations from five countries: China and Israel (both oaks), Sweden and Germany (reeds) and the USA (an oak–reed hybrid).","Abulof, Uriel Penne Shirley Le Bonan Pu",International Political Science Review,155,33

Clinical record systems contain codes to denote when such an offer has been declined by a patient (although these can in some cases be entered for a variety of other reasons including vaccination delay, or other administrative issues). We set out to describe the patterns of usage of codes for COVID-19 vaccines being declined. Methods With the approval of NHS England and using the full pseudonymised primary care records for 57.9 million NHS patients, we identified all patients in key vaccine priority groups: aged over 50, or over 16 and at increased risk from COVID-19 (Clinically Extremely Vulnerable [CEV] or otherwise ""at risk""). We describe the proportion of patients recorded as declining a COVID-19 vaccination for each priority group, and by other clinical and demographic factors; whether patients recorded as ""declined"" subsequently went on to receive a vaccination; and the distribution of code usage across GP practices. Results Of 24.5 million patients in priority groups as of May 25th 2021, 89.2% had received a vaccine, 8.8% had neither a vaccination nor a decline recorded, and 663,033 (2.7%) had a decline code recorded. Of patients with a recorded decline, 125,587 (18.9%) were subsequently vaccinated. Subsequent vaccination was slightly more common in the South Asian population than other ethnicities (e.g. 32.3% vs 22.8%, over 65s). The proportion of declining-unvaccinated patients varied strongly with ethnicity (Black 15.3%, South Asian 5.6%, White 1.5% in over 80s); and was higher in patients from more deprived areas. COVID-19 vaccine decline codes were present in almost all practices (98.8%), but with wide variation between practices in rates of usage. Among all priority groups, declining-unvaccinated status was most common in CEV (3.3%). Conclusions Clinical codes indicative of COVID-19 vaccinations being declined are widely used in English general practice. They are substantially more common among Black and South Asian patients, and patients from more deprived areas. There is a need for more detailed survey and/or qualitative research with patients and clinicians to determine the most common reasons for these recorded declines.","Curtis, H.

Longitudinal studies of Non-Human Primates (NHP) offer unique advantages to categorizing the diverse patterns of cortical growth trajectories. Here, we used latent growth models to characterize the trajectories of typical cortical thickness development in Japanese macaques at each cortical surface vertex (i.e. grayordinate). Cortical thickness from 4 to 36 months showed regional specific linear and non-linear trajectories and distinct maturation timing across the cortex. Intriguingly, we revealed a “accumulation/ablation phenomenon” of cortical maturation where the most profound development changes in cortical thickness occur in the accumulation or ablation zones surrounding the focal points (i.e., a center of a delineated regions where cortical thickness is thickest or thinnest) throughout the brain. We further examined maternal diet and inflammation in the context of these typical brain trajectories and known network architecture. A well-controlled NHP model of a maternal “Western-style” diet was used alongside measures of inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the mothers during gestation. We observed that these accumulation and ablation zones of variable change might be most susceptible to environmental effects. The maternal factors, diet and inflammation during pregnancy were distinctively associated with different aspects of offspring cortical development reflected in regions related to distinctive functional networks. Our findings characterize the versatile intricacies of typical cortical thickness development and highlight how the maternal environment plays a role in offspring cortical development.","Ramirez, Julian S.B.; Hermosillo, Robert; Thomas, Elina; Zhu, Jennifer Y.; Sturgeon, Darrick; Schifsky, Emma; Galassi, Anthony; Thompson, Jacqueline R.; Bagley, Jennifer L.; Milham, Michael P.; Miranda-Dominguez, Oscar; Papadakis, Samantha; Bah, Muhammed; Mitchell, AJ; Xu, Ting; Graham, Alice M.; Feczko, Eric; Sullivan, Elinor L.; Fair, Damien A.",bioRxiv,155,8

Studies have revealed that sarcopenia[2, 3], decreased performance status[4], and poor performance on biometric testing[3, 5] predicts worse survival in patients with advanced, incurable malignancies. Physical activity (PA) has been shown to mitigate these effects and in some cases improve cancer specific survival [6-9]. However, there is a need for further research in this area for patients with hematologic malignancies. Here in we describe the results of a pilot study to assess a physical activity intervention in elderly patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Methods: We designed a single arm, feasibility study utilizing physical and behavioral therapy interventions to help participants adhere to a prescribed exercise program. Eligible patients (age ≥65 years old) were recruited from the multiple myeloma treatment clinic. Baseline, 3-month and 6-month assessments occurred. The intervention included both text messaging and video visits with behavioral coaches and physical therapists to monitor activity levels, review and modify exercise plans, , and enhance motivation and self-efficacy. Our primary aim was to establish the feasibility of recruitment, enrollment, and adherence of the exercise intervention. Our secondary objective was to evaluate changes in fitness (6 minute walk test, grip strength, and the Short Physical Performance Battery). Results: Between 11/18/2019-03/04/2020, 9 participants enrolled on the study (goal of 20). New enrollment was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Median age of the participants was 70 (range 65-86). Six (67%) were female. Eight participants (89%) completed the 6-month intervention. Participants completed 97.8% of the scheduled visits. At 3 and 6 months there was a mean change of moderate/vigorous activity of 26.0% (SD 89.6%) and -0.5% (SD 56.4%) respectively. At 3 and 6 months there was a mean change in step count per day of -5.1% (SD 25.3%) and -1.3% (SD 32.2%) respectively. Overall fitness was preserved over the 6-month period. Conclusions: Prior to COVID-19 pandemic, the study was on track to meet feasibility endpoints of recruitment, enrollment, and retention. The primary endpoint of increasing physical activity was not met. However, adults in our region experienced a 20-30% reduction in physical activity during the pandemic [10]. In the target population, reductions in the absence of intervention may have been even greater, given their pronounced vulnerability to COVID-19 complications. Thus, the true benefits of the intervention may have been difficult to detect during this period. Lack of a control arm is a limiting factor in making further conclusions about the potential benefits of our intervention.","Binder, A.

During this process light, an important environmental signal, triggers the inhibition of mesocotyl elongation and the production of photosynthetically active chloroplasts, and etiolated leaves transition from the “sink” stage to the “source” stage. De-etiolation has been extensively studied in maize (Zea mays L). However, little is known about how this transition is regulated. In this study, we describe a quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic atlas of the de-etiolation process in maize. We identified 16,420 proteins and quantified 14,168. In addition, 8,746 phosphorylation sites within 3,110 proteins were identified. From the proteomic and phosphoproteomic data combined, we identified a total of 17,436 proteins, 27.6% of which are annotated protein coding genes in the Zea_mays AGPv3.28 database. Only 6% of proteins significantly changed in abundance during de-etiolation. In contrast, the phosphorylation levels of more than 25% of phosphoproteins significantly changed; these included proteins involved in gene expression and homeostatic pathways and rate-limiting enzymes involved in photosynthesis light and carbon reactions. Based on phosphoproteomic analysis, 34% (1,057) of all phosphoproteins identified in this study contained more than three phosphorylation sites, and 37 proteins contained more than 16 phosphorylation sites, which shows that multi-phosphorylation is ubiquitous during the de-etiolation process. Our results suggest that plants might preferentially regulate the level of PTMs rather than protein abundance for adapting to changing environments. The study of PTMs could thus better reveal the regulation of de-etiolation.","Gao, Zhi-Fang; Shen, Zhuo; Chao, Qing; Yan, Zhen; Ge, Xuan-Liang; Lu, Tiancong; Zheng, Haiyan; Qian, Chun-Rong; Wang, Bai-Chen",bioRxiv,155,5

Overall, we identified 14 viruses that likely infect birds, 11 of which were novel, including members of the Reoviridae, Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, and Phenuiviridae. Strikingly, 12 of the viruses identified were from juvenile birds sampled in the first year of their life, compared to only two viruses in adult birds. Similarly, both viral abundance and alpha diversity were higher in juvenile than adult birds. Notably, time of sampling had no association with virome structure such that the migratory period may not play a major role in structuring avian viromes. As well as informing studies of virus ecology, that host age impacts viral assemblages is a critical consideration for the future surveillance of novel and emerging viruses.","Wille, Michelle; Shi, Mang; Hurt, Aeron C.; Klaassen, Marcel; Holmes, Edward C.",bioRxiv,155,1

While the Nextstrain and GISAID portals offer widely used systems for the classification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, both present relevant limitations. Here we propose a highly reproducible method for the systematic classification of SARS-CoV-2 viral types. To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we conduct an extensive comparative genomic analysis of more than 20,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our classification system delineates 12 clusters and 4 super-clusters in SARS-CoV-2, with a highly biased spatio-temporal distribution worldwide, and provides important observations concerning the evolutionary processes associated with the emergence of novel viral types. Based on the estimates of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate and genetic distances of genomes of the early pandemic phase, we infer that SARS-CoV-2 could have been circulating in humans since August-November 2019. The observed pattern of genomic variability is remarkably similar between all clusters and super-clusters, being UTRs and the s2m element, a highly conserved secondary structure element, the most variable genomic regions. While several polymorphic sites that are specific to one or more clusters were predicted to be under positive or negative selection, overall, our analyses also suggest that the emergence of novel genome types is unlikely to be driven by widespread convergent evolution and independent fixation of advantageous substitutions. While, in the absence of rigorous experimental validation, several questions concerning the evolutionary processes and the phenotypic characteristics (increased/decreased virulence) remain open, we believe that the approach outlined in this study can be of relevance for the tracking and functional characterization of different types of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.","Chiara, Matteo; Horner, David S.; Gissi, Carmela; Pesole, Graziano",bioRxiv,155,1

NS1 is highly immunogenic and antibodies targeting NS1 can have both protective and pathogenic roles. In the present study, we investigated the humoral immune response to Zika virus NS1 and found NS1 to be an immunodominant viral antigen associated with the presence of autoreactive antibodies. Through single B cell cultures, we coupled binding assays and BCR sequencing, confirming the immunodominance of NS1. Of note, we demonstrate the presence of self-reactive clones in germinal centers after both infection and immunization, some of which clones presenting cross-reactivity with NS1. Sequence analysis of anti-NS1 B cell clones showed sequence features associated with pathogenic autoreactive antibodies. Our findings demonstrate NS1 immunodominance at the cellular level as well as a potential role for NS1 in ZIKV associated autoimmune manifestations.","Cavazzoni, Cecilia B.; Bozza, Vicente B.

Since neurovirulence may be determined at the early stages of infection of the central nervous system (CNS), we hypothesize that it may depend on the ability of the virus to induce proinflammatory signals from brain cells for the recruitment of blood-derived inflammatory cells. To test this hypothesis, we studied the interaction between coronaviruses (mouse hepatitis virus) of different neurovirulences with primary cell cultures of brain immune cells (astrocytes and microglia) and mouse tissues. We found that the level of neurovirulence of the virus correlates with its differential ability to induce proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 12 [IL-12] p40, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6, IL-15, and IL-1beta) in astrocytes and microglia and in mouse brains and spinal cords. These findings suggest that coronavirus neurovirulence may depend on a novel discriminatory ability of astrocytes and microglia to induce a proinflammatory response in the CNS.","Li, Yun; Fu, Li; Gonzales, Donna M; Lavi, Ehud",Journal of virology,155,33

For this reason, it is necessary to identify especially vulnerable social groups and protective factors that may reduce this impact, which was the objective of this study. METHODS Using snowball sampling approach, 1,596 people residing in Spain during the lockdown answered an online questionnaire that included information on sociodemographic variables, symptoms, and contact with the disease, risk perception, precautionary measures to prevent infection and coping strategies during lockdown. Psychological impact was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status with the Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Simple linear regression models were performed to analyze the associations between the study variables and the psychological impact of the pandemic and the mental health of the participants. RESULTS Of all respondents, 24.7% reported a moderate or severe psychological impact, and 48.8% showed mental health problems. Women, students and the population with a lower level of economic income, in addition to those having less available space per person in the household presented a more significant psychological impact and worse mental health. Living with someone from the high-risk vulnerable group, and anticipating the adverse economic effects of social-health crisis raised the emotional distress and psychological morbidity. Precautionary measures to prevent infection did not present a connection to the psychological impact of the pandemic; however, several coping strategies did help to reduce it. CONCLUSIONS These findings outline the existence of especially vulnerable social groups to the impact of the pandemic, and suggest lines of action that help reduce the psychosocial consequences of COVID-19.","Parrado-González, Alberto; León-Jariego, José C",Revista espanola de salud publica,155,22

Illustrative cases.,13.331505,7.223827,2013,"The 5'-terminal end of the genomic RNA of the Lelystad virus isolate (LV) of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus was determined. To construct full-length cDNA clones, the 5'-terminal sequence was ligated to cDNA clones covering the complete genome of LV. When RNA that was transcribed in vitro from these full-length cDNA clones was transfected into BHK-21 cells, infectious LV was produced and secreted. The virus was rescued by passage to porcine alveolar lung macrophages or CL2621 cells. When infectious transcripts were transfected to porcine alveolar lung macrophages or CL2621 cells, no infectious virus was produced due to the poor transfection efficiency of these cells. The growth properties of the viruses produced by BHK-21 cells transfected with infectious transcripts of LV cDNA resembled the growth properties of the parental virus from which the cDNA was derived. Two nucleotide changes leading to a unique PacI restriction site directly downstream of the ORF7 gene were introduced in the genome-length cDNA clone. The virus recovered from this mutated cDNA clone retained the PacI site, which confirmed the de novo generation of infectious LV from cloned cDNA. These results indicate that the infectious clone of LV enables us to mutagenize the viral genome at specific sites and that it will therefore be useful for detailed molecular characterization of the virus, as well as for the development of a safe and effective live vaccine for use in pigs.","Meulenberg, J J; Bos-de Ruijter, J N; van de Graaf, R; Wensvoort, G; Moormann, R J",Journal of virology,155,24

From November 2011 until March 2012, a prolective, comparative, longitudinal, non-randomized study was performed on patients submitted to total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH). On entry, patients were assigned to two different groups, Group 1: Vaginal cuff closure with unidirectional #00 (n = 25) barbed suture, and Group 2: Vaginal cuff closure with polyglactin 910 #1 suture. The length of closure time and the frequency of dehiscence in vaginal vault were measured on the 14th postoperative day. We did not find significant differences between the groups on the general characteristic analysis. However, significant differences were found (P = .029) in the average vaginal cuff closure time (12.7 ± 3.1 min. for barbed suture group vs. 20.4 ± 7.1 min. for polyglactin 910 group). No dehiscence case was found in any group. Based on the results of this study, we can conclude that unidirectional barbed suture reduces the surgical time for vaginal cuff closure during total laparoscopic hysterectomy and doesn't increase the vaginal cuff dehiscence risk.","Morgan-Ortiz, Fred; Contreras-Soto, Juan Omar; Soto-Pineda, Juan M; Zepeda, Marco A López A López; Peraza-Garay, Felipe J",Surgical technology international,155,4

Assessment of the efficacy of these measures must be rapid as well. In this paper, the authors present a framework to monitor the efficacy of control measures in real time. Bayesian estimation of the reproduction number R (mean number of cases generated by a single infectious person) during an outbreak allows them to judge rapidly whether the epidemic is under control (R < 1). Only counts and time of onset of symptoms, plus tracing information from a subset of cases, are required. Markov chain Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo sampling are used to infer the temporal pattern of R up to the last observation. The operating characteristics of the method are investigated in a simulation study of severe acute respiratory syndrome-like outbreaks. In this particular setting, control measures lacking efficacy (R > or = 1.1) could be detected after 2 weeks in at least 70% of the epidemics, with less than a 5% probability of a wrong conclusion. When control measures are efficacious (R = 0.5), this situation may be evidenced in 68% of the epidemics after 2 weeks and 92% of the epidemics after 3 weeks, with less than a 5% probability of a wrong conclusion.","Cauchemez, Simon; Boëlle, Pierre-Yves; Thomas, Guy; Valleron, Alain-Jacques",American journal of epidemiology,155,19

Recruiters must know how motivation variables and correlation patterns differ with donor experience and sex. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Data addressing reasons for donating, statements about the blood supply, beliefs about donation consequences, and reasons for avoiding donation were collected from 450 undergraduates. Principal components analysis was used to investigate the underlying factorial structure of each domain. Men-women and donor-nondonor differences were explored with multivariate analysis of variance techniques. RESULTS A bivariate model better represented donor beliefs than did a bipolar conceptualization. Negative beliefs distinguished donors and nondonors more so than did positive factors. Altruism dominated reasons for donating, whereas logistic factors accounted for the most variance in donation avoidance. Women were more concerned about adverse physical consequences, and nondonors expressed higher levels of groundless donation-related fears. CONCLUSION Recruiters should consider the sex and donation experience of targets when they develop recruitment and retention strategies.

Among the results of inadvertent perioperative hypothermia are increased bleeding, myocardial events, impaired wound healing, and diminished renal function. Most researchers agree there is an increased incidence of surgical site infections in patients who experience inadvertent perioperative hypothermia. Forced-air warming is effective in preventing inadvertent perioperative hypothermia. Paradoxically, forced-air warmers have been implicated in causing surgical site infections in patients undergoing total knee or hip arthroplasty. The results of investigations suggest these devices harbor pathogens and cause unwanted airflow disturbances. However, no significant increases in bacterial counts were found when forced-air warmers were used according to the manufacturer's directions. The results of one study suggested the incidence of surgical site infections in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty was increased when using a forced-air warmer. However these researchers did not control for other factors affecting the incidence of surgical site infections in these patients. Current evidence does not support forced-air warmers causing surgical site infections in patients undergoing total knee or hip arthroplasty. Clinicians must use and maintain these devices as per the manufacturer's directions. They may consider using alternative warming methods. Well-conducted studies are needed to help determine the role of forced-air warmers in causing infections in these patients.","Austin, Paul N",Annual review of nursing research,155,1

Recently, CoVs were recognized as important pathogens in captive wild ruminants. This is the first report of the isolation and detailed genetic, biologic, and antigenic characterization of a bovine-like CoV from a giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) in a wild-animal park in the United States. CoV particles were detected by immune electron microscopy in fecal samples from three giraffes with mild-to-severe diarrhea. From one of the three giraffe samples, a CoV (GiCoV-OH3) was isolated and successfully adapted to serial passage in human rectal tumor 18 cell cultures. Hemagglutination assays, receptor-destroying enzyme activity, hemagglutination inhibition, and fluorescence focus neutralization tests revealed close biological and antigenic relationships between the GiCoV-OH3 isolate and selected respiratory and enteric bovine CoV (BCoV) strains. When orally inoculated into a BCoV-seronegative gnotobiotic calf, GiCoV-OH3 caused severe diarrhea and virus shedding within 2 to 3 days. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses were performed to assess its genetic relatedness to other CoVs. Molecular characterization confirmed that the new isolate belongs to group 2a of the mammalian CoVs and revealed closer genetic relatedness between GiCoV-OH3 and the enteric BCoVs BCoV-ENT and BCoV-DB2, whereas BCoV-Mebus was more distantly related. Detailed sequence analysis of the GiCoV-OH3 spike gene demonstrated the presence of a deletion in the variable region of the S1 subunit (from amino acid 543 to amino acid 547), which is a region associated with pathogenicity and tissue tropism for other CoVs. The point mutations identified in the structural proteins (by comparing GiCoV-OH3, BCoV-ENT, BCoV-DB2, and BCoV-Mebus) were most conserved among GiCoV-OH3, BCoV-ENT, and BCoV-DB2, whereas most of the point mutations in the nonstructural proteins were unique to GiCoV-OH3. Our results confirm the existence of a bovine-like CoV transmissible to cattle from wild ruminants, namely, giraffes, but with certain genetic properties different from those of BCoVs.","Hasoksuz, Mustafa; Alekseev, Konstantin; Vlasova, Anastasia; Zhang, Xinsheng; Spiro, David; Halpin, Rebecca; Wang, Shiliang; Ghedin, Elodie; Saif, Linda J",Journal of virology,155,11

METHODS SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA were both measured in 26 specimens from 16 patients with SARS, 40 follow up specimens from the same batch of patients, and appropriate control subjects. The relation between SARS positivity and GAPDH mRNA concentration was investigated using the chi2 test. Increasing the sensitivity for SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA detection was investigated in follow up specimens in which SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA were not detected initially. RESULTS Varying amounts of SARS-CoV were found in the 26 SARS-CoV positive specimens and SARS-CoV was not detected in the 40 follow up specimens and controls. In addition, concentrations of GAPDH mRNA were significantly different between the patients with SARS, follow up specimens, and healthy controls (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.05). Moreover, GAPDH mRNA concentrations were highly correlated with SARS-CoV positivity (chi2 = 5.43; p<0.05). Finally, SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA were both detected in three follow up urine specimens that were initially negative when the amount of cDNA used was increased from 5 microl to 10 and 15 microl.

Muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase levels are commonly encountered in patients with SARS. However, the nature and cause of myopathy associated with a SARS infection are unknown because, to our knowledge, there has been no report of histological or postmortem examination of the skeletal muscle from SARS-infected patients. OBJECTIVE To determine the exact nature of the myopathy associated with SARS. METHOD Postmortem skeletal muscles from 8 consecutive patients who died of SARS in March 2003 were studied under light and electron microscopy as well as immunohistochemistry. RESULTS Focal myofiber necrosis was identified in 4 of 8 cases. Macrophage infiltration and regenerative fiber were scanty. All 4 patients treated with a steroid had significant myofiber atrophy. In situ hybridization for coronavirus was negative in all subjects. Viral cultures for coronavirus and examination for viral particles under electron microscopy were performed in 2 patients. The viral culture yielded no organisms and there were no viral particles seen on electron microscopic examination. CONCLUSIONS There is a spectrum of myopathic changes associated with a SARS infection. Focal myofiber necrosis is common and possibly is immune mediated. Critical illness myopathy and superimposed steroid myopathy may also play an important role in SARS.","Leung, Thomas W; Wong, Ka Sing; Hui, Andrew C; To, Ka Fai; Lai, Sik To; Ng, Wai Fu; Ng, Ho Keung",Archives of neurology,155,17

A coronavirus (CoV) nonstructural protein, nsp14, contains conserved active-site motifs of cellular exonucleases, including DNA proofreading enzymes, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) nsp14 has 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity in vitro. Here, we show that nsp14 ExoN remarkably increases replication fidelity of the CoV murine hepatitis virus (MHV). Replacement of conserved MHV ExoN active-site residues with alanines resulted in viable mutant viruses with growth and RNA synthesis defects that during passage accumulated 15-fold more mutations than wild-type virus without changes in growth fitness. The estimated mutation rate for ExoN mutants was similar to that reported for other RNA viruses, whereas that of wild-type MHV was less than the established rates for RNA viruses in general, suggesting that CoVs with intact ExoN replicate with unusually high fidelity. Our results indicate that nsp14 ExoN plays a critical role in prevention or repair of nucleotide incorporation errors during genome replication. The established mutants are unique tools to test the hypothesis that high replication fidelity is required for the evolution and stability of large RNA genomes.","Eckerle, Lance D; Lu, Xiaotao; Sperry, Steven M; Choi, Leena; Denison, Mark R",Journal of virology,155,19

These cells were mouse L-2 and 3T3-17Cl-1 cells as well as residual peritoneal macrophages from persistently LDV-infected mice. Productive LDV infection of these cells via pseudotype virions was inhibited by antibodies to the MHV spike protein or to the MHV receptor, indicating that LDV RNA entered the cells via particles containing the MHV envelope. Simultaneous exposure of L-2 cells to both LDV and MHV resulted in infection by MHV but not by LDV. The results indicate that an internal block to LDV replication is not the cause of the LDV nonpermissiveness of many cell types, including the majority of the macrophages in an adult mouse. Instead, LDV permissiveness is restricted to a subpopulation of mouse macrophages because only these cells possess a surface component that acts as an LDV receptor.","Even, C; Plagemann, P G",Journal of virology,155,1

Two of 18, and eight of 17 samples were seropositive for the Massachusetts and Arkansas serotypes of infectious bronchitis virus, respectively. Five of the eight positive individuals were juveniles, two of which were seropositive for both serotypes. All other serologic and genetic tests were negative. Because the ecological significance of these results is unknown, the pathogenesis, transmission, and/or population-level influences of infectious bronchitis and related avian coronaviruses for lesser prairie chickens deserves further study.","Peterson, Markus J; Ferro, Pamela J; Peterson, M Nils; Sullivan, Robert M; Toole, Benjamin E; Silvy, Nova J",Journal of wildlife diseases,155,9

Microbial phenotypic characteristics, such as protein, bacteriophage, and chromatographic profiles, as well as biotyping and susceptibility testing, are used in most routine laboratories for identification and differentiation. Nucleic acid techniques, such as plasmid profiling, various methods for generating restriction fragment length polymorphisms, and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are making increasing inroads into clinical laboratories. PCR-based systems to detect the etiologic agents of disease directly from clinical samples, without the need for culture, have been useful in rapid detection of unculturable or fastidious microorganisms. Additionally, sequence analysis of amplified microbial DNA allows for identification and better characterization of the pathogen. Subspecies variation, identified by various techniques, has been shown to be important in the prognosis of certain diseases. Other important advances include the determination of viral load and the direct detection of genes or gene mutations responsible for drug resistance. Increased use of automation and user-friendly software makes these technologies more widely available. In all, the detection of infectious agents at the nucleic acid level represents a true synthesis of clinical chemistry and clinical microbiology techniques.","Tang, Y W; Procop, G W; Persing, D H",Clinical chemistry,155,31

METHODS Between 2001 and 2010, 91 patients with Zenker diverticulum underwent transoral stapling under general anesthesia. Since 2008, the technique was modified by applying traction sutures to ease engagement of the common septum inside the stapler jaws. Perioperative variables, distribution of symptoms, and outcome of surgery were analyzed. Long-term results were compared between patients undergoing standard versus modified technique of transoral stapling. RESULTS The transoral approach was successfully completed in 79 (86.8 %) patients with a median age of 74 years. Overall morbidity was 5 %, and there was no mortality. The median length of hospital stay was 2 days. Six patients were lost to follow-up. After a median follow-up of 53 (range, 12-114) months, an improvement of dysphagia and regurgitation scores (p < 0.001) and a reduction in the number of pneumonia episodes per year (p < 0.001) was recorded. The long-term success rate of the procedure was 80.1 %. At a median time of 12 months, 14 patients complained of recurrent symptoms, 7 of whom needed an open (n = 4) or transoral (n = 3) reoperation. Use of traction sutures resulted in a greater long-term success compared with the standard procedure (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS Transoral stapling is a safe and effective technique. A repeat procedure is feasible in case of recurrent diverticulum. The use of traction sutures applied at the apex of the common septum before stapling might increase the long-term success of the technique.","Bonavina, Luigi; Rottoli, Matteo; Bona, Davide; Siboni, Stefano; Russo, Iris S; Bernardi, Daniele",Surgical endoscopy,155,17

Hemagglutination inhibition was used with influenza viruses. The percentage of positive results was 78.5% and 62.5% respectively for the serotypes H1N1 and H3N2. A clear reduction in the spread of antibodies was observed in the autumn. The ELISA technique was used with the porcine respiratory coronavirus. As antigen we used the antigenically related transmissible porcine gastroenteritis virus. Using this technique 87% of the sera were positive. Some of these sera with representative ELISA values were confirmed by means of serum neutralisation and radioimmune precipitation of the viral proteins.

To examine trends in the prevalence of self-reported VI among adults (persons aged ≥18 years) with diagnosed diabetes in the United States and to assess reported access to eye-care providers, CDC analyzed 1997-2010 data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that although the number of adults with diagnosed diabetes reporting VI increased, the age-adjusted percentage of adults with diagnosed diabetes who reported VI declined significantly, from 23.7% in 1997 to 16.7% in 2010. During this 14-year period, age-adjusted VI prevalence declined significantly among most categories of adults with diabetes: men, women, whites, Hispanics, those with some college or higher education, and those diagnosed with diabetes for ≥3 years. Prevalence also declined among those aged ≥45 years. The percentage of adults with diagnosed diabetes and self-reported VI who reported having consulted an eye-care provider in the past year remained constant at approximately 63%.

Objective To assess the knowledge, awareness, and practice (KAP) of the Dentists to combat the pandemic which could help shape future guidelines and policies to be implemented in dental settings. Method This cross-sectional descriptive study included series of multiple-choice questions distributed online, assessing dentists' KAP towards COVID-19, its impact on dentistry and their psychological well-being. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version 20 for mac Operating System (OS). Descriptive statistics was performed, and frequencies of responses were reported in proportion. Non-parametric tests of independence and Chi-square test were performed to see the association between the categorical variables. Result Around 84% of the respondents accurately answered mode of transmission, 68% inquired about the travel history while only 49% measured the body temperature. Also, only 42% were receiving salary. A statistically significant difference concerning impact and practice during the COVID-19 was observed between general practitioner and specialist working at different work places. Conclusion Majority of Dentists have good knowledge and awareness but there were certain pitfalls in attitude and practice level calling out for more efficient training programs, precise guidelines, and treatment protocols to put into practice.

Many of the robots that are being used employ ultraviolet lights mounted on a mobile base to inactivate the pathogens. However, these lights are often mounted in a fixed configuration and do not provide adequate decontamination of horizontal surfaces, which can be a major source of cross-contamination. In the paper, we describe the design, implementation, and testing of an Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI) system implemented on a mobile manipulation robot. A human supervisor designates a surface for disinfection, the robot autonomously plans and executes an end-effector trajectory to disinfect the surface to the required certainty, and then displays the results for the human supervisor to verify. We also provide some background information on UVGI and describe how we constructed and validated mathematical models of Ultraviolet (UV) radiation propagation and accumulation. Finally, we describe our implementation on a Fetch mobile manipulation platform, and discuss how the practicalities of implementation on a real robot affect our models.","Sanchez, Alan G; Smart, William D",ArXiv,155,20

Indeed, the major topics and challenges on current oncological research are the identification of tumorigenic and metastatic molecules in tumor-cell-derived exosomes as well as elucidating the pathways that guarantee these components to be included in exosomes. The bacterial EVs have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal (GI) tumors and chronic inflammatory diseases; however, the possible function of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in tumorigenesis remains largely underestimated. We suggest that EVs from both eukaryotic cells and different microbes in GI tract act as regulators of intracellular and cross-species communication, thus particularly facilitate tumor cell survival and multi-drug resistance. Therefore, our review introduces comprehensive knowledge on the promising role of EVs (mainly exosomes and OMVs) production of GI cancer development and gut microbiome, as well as its roles in developing novel therapeutic strategies.","Chen, Yi; Xu, Yansong; Zhong, Huage; Yuan, Hao; Liang, Fangfang; Liu, Junjie; Tang, Weizhong",American journal of cancer research,155,28

Fusion of coronaviruses is generally thought to occur at neutral pH, although there is also evidence for a role of acidic endosomes during entry of a variety of coronaviruses. Therefore, the molecular basis of coronavirus fusion during entry into host cells remains incompletely defined. Here, we examined coronavirus-cell fusion and entry employing the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Virus entry into cells was inhibited by acidotropic bases and by other inhibitors of pH-dependent endocytosis. We carried out fluorescence-dequenching fusion assays of R18-labeled virions and show that for IBV, coronavirus-cell fusion occurs in a low-pH-dependent manner, with a half-maximal rate of fusion occurring at pH 5.5. Fusion was reduced, but still occurred, at lower temperatures (20 degrees C). We observed no effect of inhibitors of endosomal proteases on the fusion event. These data are the first direct measure of virus-cell fusion for any coronavirus and demonstrate that the coronavirus IBV employs a direct, low-pH-dependent virus-cell fusion activation reaction. We further show that IBV was not inactivated, and fusion was unaffected, by prior exposure to pH 5.0 buffer. Virions also showed evidence of reversible conformational changes in their surface proteins, indicating that aspects of the fusion reaction may be reversible in nature.","Chu, Victor C; McElroy, Lisa J; Chu, Vicky; Bauman, Beverley E; Whittaker, Gary R",Journal of virology,155,28

RESULTS Of the 5 SARS children, 3 presented a history of close contact with SARS patients. Fever was the initiative symptom, 4 had a body temperature of over 38 degrees C with the highest being 40 degrees C; fever sustained from 4 to 7 days with an average of 5.6 days. All the 5 cases developed nonproductive cough; on auscultation, both moist and dry rales could be heard in 3 out of the 5 cases. Mean total white count of peripheral blood was (2.96 - 6.9) x 10(9)/L, and was < 5.0 x 10(9)/L in 4 cases.

IgG and IgM antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae as well as blood culture for bacteria were all negative. Findings on chest X-ray examination: 4 cases showed presence of patchy or macular opacities with cord-like shadows in unilateral lung plates while 1 case each showed ground-glass-like opacity and migratory changes; 1 case showed interstitial changes in the lungs in the form of irregular reticular lattice and cord-like shadows. Two cases received CT scanning and macular-patchy or spotty shadows were seen all over the lung. The shortest time for absorption of foci in the lungs was 7 days while the longest was 33 days with a mean of 15 +/- 6 days. None of the cases had any signs of fibrosis in the lungs.

Aneurysms with a larger side branch vessel might have greater risk after treatment in terms of hemodynamics. Although a stent could lead to flow reduction entering the aneurysm, it would drastically alter the flow rate inside the side branch vessel. This may result in side-branch hypoperfusion subsequent to stenting. In addition, two patient-specific bifurcation aneurysms are tested, and the results show good agreement with the idealized models.

Point-of-care (POC) tests, where results are available within minutes, can distinguish between viral and GAS pharyngitis and can therefore guide treatment in primary healthcare settings such as community pharmacies, which are often the first point of contact with the healthcare system. In this opinion article, the evidence for the use of POC testing in the community pharmacy has been discussed. Evidence suggests that pharmacy POC testing can promote appropriate antibiotic use and reduce the need for general practitioner consultations. Challenges to implementation include cost, training and 'who prescribes', with country and regional differences presenting a particular issue. Despite these challenges, POC testing for pharyngitis has become widely available in pharmacies in some countries and may represent a strategy to contain antibiotic resistance and contribute to antimicrobial stewardship.","Essack, Sabiha; Bell, John; Burgoyne, Douglas; Tongrod, Wirat; Duerden, Martin; Sessa, Aurelio; Altiner, Attila; Shephard, Adrian",,155,22

To this end, nowadays more than ever, it is crucial to deliver solutions that can help people to manage and control their stress, as well as to reduce sleep disturbances, so as to improve their health and overall quality of life. Technology, and in particular Ambient Intelligence Environments, can help towards that direction, when considering that they are able to understand the needs of their users, identify their behavior, learn their preferences, and act and react in their interest. This work presents two systems that have been designed and developed in the context of an Intelligent Home, namely CaLmi and HypnOS, which aim to assist users that struggle with stress and poor sleep quality, respectively. Both of the systems rely on real-time data collected by wearable devices, as well as contextual information retrieved from the ambient facilities of the Intelligent Home, so as to offer appropriate pervasive relaxation programs (CaLmi) or provide personalized insights regarding sleep hygiene (HypnOS) to the residents. This article will describe the design process that was followed, the functionality of both systems, the results of the user studies that were conducted for the evaluation of their end-user applications, and a discussion about future plans.","Leonidis, Asterios; Korozi, Maria; Sykianaki, Eirini; Tsolakou, Eleni; Kouroumalis, Vasilios; Ioannidi, Danai; Stavridakis, Andreas; Antona, Margherita; Stephanidis, Constantine",Sensors (Basel),155,20

Method: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA), and undifferentiated arthritis (UA), participating in the Northern Savo 2010 Study, were evaluated for metabolic syndrome (MetS), metabolic and inflammatory markers, antibodies to MAA-LDL, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Results: Among 135 newly diagnosed untreated patients, of whom 53 (39%) were diagnosed to have RA, 44 (33%) SpA, and 38 (28%) UA, 49%, 30%, and 47%, respectively, had MetS. After adjusting for age and gender, anti-MAA-LDL immunoglobulin (Ig)A (p = 0.009), IgG (p = 0.031), and IgM (p = 0.001) levels differed between the diagnostic categories, but not in patients with MetS present or absent. All antibody classes to MAA-LDL correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and IgA and IgG antibodies with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). IgA antibodies to MAA-LDL correlated with rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), fasting plasma glucose, IgA antibodies to A. actinomycetemcomitans, and in IgA and IgG antibodies to P. gingivalis. Conclusion: Among various arthritis groups, antibodies to MAA-LDL were most common in RA. Antibodies to modified lipoproteins were associated with inflammation measured by ESR and hs-CRP. IgA antibodies to MAA-LDL correlated with age, antibodies to periodontal bacteria, RF, ACPA, and fasting glucose. Associations between antibodies to MAA-LDL and antibodies to periodontal bacteria, RA-associated antibodies, inflammatory parameters, and plasma glucose already reflect cardiovascular burden in inflammatory joint diseases at diagnosis.","Kononoff, A; Hörkkö, S; Pussinen, P; Kautiainen, H; Elfving, P; Savolainen, E; Arstila, L; Niinisalo, H; Rutanen, J; Marjoniemi, O; Kaipiainen-Seppänen, O",Scand J Rheumatol,155,29

The disease modifying therapies in pwMS can add a more severe risk of infection when compared to the general population. Alemtuzumab is an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody and it is one of the most immunosuppressive drugs used in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of Covid-19 infection that occurred in a 24-year-old woman with MS and treated with alemtuzumab. The infection occurred 4 months after administration of the first course of alemtuzumab and had a benign course with subsequent development of antibodies. Furthermore, we present a brief review of the literature on similar published cases. DISCUSSION: We reviewed 17 articles concerning COVID-19 infection in MS patients in treatment with Alemtuzumab. In our case and all screened cases no severe course of disease was noted and no fatality was observed. Systematic compilation of this observation comforts clinicians about the course of Covid-19 infection despite alemtuzumab immunosuppressive treatment CONCLUSIONS: The risk of serious COVID-19 disease in MS patients treated with alemtuzumab is unknown. Physicians need to monitor carefully pwMS treated with alemtuzumab and to consider COVID-19 infection related relapse in the MS patients. Further research is recommended to evaluate the beneficial-risk profile of alemtuzumab in pandemic era.","Iovino, Aniello; Olivieri, Nunzio; Aruta, Francesco; Giaquinto, Emanuele; Ruggiero, Lucia; Spina, Emanuele; Tozza, Stefano; Manganelli, Fiore; Iodice, Rosa",Mult Scler Relat Disord,155,1

The high resistance in the pulmonary circulation, as a result of small vessel thrombosis and hypoxemia, is the major cause of right heart failure associated with a particularly high mortality in severe COVID-19. Timely identification of patients at high risk for RV failure, optimization of mechanical ventilation to limit its adverse effects on RV preload and afterload, avoidance of medication-related increase in the pulmonary vascular resistance, and the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in refractory respiratory failure with hemodynamic instability, before RV failure develops, can improve patient survival. Since it was confirmed that the right-sided heart is particularly involved in the clinical deterioration of patients with COVID-19 and pressure overload-induced RV dysfunction plays a key role for patient outcome, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) received increasing attention. Limited TTE focused on the right heart appears highly useful in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and particularly beneficial for monitoring of critically ill patients. In addition to detection of right-sided heart dilation and RV dysfunction, it enables assessment of RV-pulmonary arterial coupling and evaluation of RV adaptability to pressure loading which facilitate useful prognostic statements to be made. The increased use of bedside TTE focused on the right heart could facilitate more personalized management and treatment of hospitalized patients and can contribute towards reducing the high mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Dandel, Michael",Heart fail. rev,155,6

Afterward, diffuse edema with hypoalbuminemia appeared in the context of a capillary leak syndrome. In both patients, repeated nasal swabs were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but each patient had high titers of immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The negative PCR results in the presence of immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G suggested that the inflammatory response developed in the late phase of viral infection, when SARS-CoV-2 was not detectable in the upper airway.

Many factors have been identified as risk factors for SARS-CoV-2, with much early attention being paid to body mass index (BMI), which is a well-known cardiometabolic risk factor. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to examine the impact of additional baseline cardiometabolic risk factors including high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), Apolipoprotein B (ApoB), triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and diabetes on the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in UK Biobank (UKB) study participants. METHODS: We examined the effect of BMI, lipid profiles, diabetes and alcohol intake on the odds of testing positive for SARS-Cov-2 among 9,005 UKB participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 16 through July 14, 2020. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed using logistic regression adjusted for age, sex and ancestry. RESULTS: Higher BMI, Type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 odds (p < 0.05) while HDL-C and ApoA-I were associated with decreased odds (p < 0.001). Though the effect of BMI, Type II diabetes and HbA1c were eliminated when HDL-C was controlled, the effect of HDL-C remained significant when BMI was controlled for. LDL-C, ApoB and triglyceride levels were not found to be significantly associated with increased odds. CONCLUSION: Elevated HDL-C and ApoA-I levels were associated with reduced odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, while higher BMI, type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased odds. The effects of BMI, type II diabetes and HbA1c levels were no longer significant after controlling for HDL-C, suggesting that these effects may be mediated in part through regulation of HDL-C levels. In summary, our study suggests that baseline HDL-C level may be useful for stratifying SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and corroborates the emerging picture that HDL-C may confer protection against sepsis in general and SARS-CoV-2 in particular.","Scalsky, Ryan J; Chen, Yi-Ju; Desai, Karan; O039,; Connell, Jeffery R; Perry, James A; Hong, Charles C",PLoS One,155,15

Presently, COVID-19 is an unprecedented worldwide biohazard, and a nosocomial outbreak can occur in any hospital at any time. Therefore, we reviewed the literature regarding hospital preparedness, the initial management of COVID-19, and the surveillance of healthcare workers (HCWs) to find information that would be generally useful for physicians when confronted with COVID-19. In terms of hospital preparedness, each hospital should develop an incident management system and establish a designated multidisciplinary medical team. To initiate case management, COVID-19 should be suspected based on patient symptoms and/or high-risk history and then should be confirmed by viral testing, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Although some patients will become critically ill, the guidelines for respiratory failure and septic shock for non-COVID-19 cases can be followed for supportive treatment. Antiviral medications should be carefully selected because the available information is confused by the large volume of preprint literature and unreliable data. HCWs who have come into contact with patients with COVID-19 can generate new in-hospital clusters of COVID-19 cases. Quarantine following contact tracking with risk stratification is effective in preventing transmission, and the essentials of medical surveillance include monitoring different types of symptoms, delegation of supervision, and continuation of surveillance regardless of the RT-PCR results. Preparation for COVID-19 is recommended before the first COVID-19 case is encountered.","Kaito, Daiki; Matsumura, Kazuki; Yamamoto, Ryo",Keio j. med,155,1

The global exploration problem is decomposed into a set of separate MD trajectories that can be restarted within a selective process to achieve sufficient phase-space sampling. Accurate statistical properties can be obtained through reweighting. Within this highly parallel setup, the Tinker-HP package can be powered by an arbitrary large number of GPUs on supercomputers, reducing exploration time from years to days. This approach is used to tackle the urgent modeling problem of the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease (M-pro) producing more than 38 mu s of all-atom simulations of its apo (ligand-free) dimer using the high-resolution AMOEBA PFF. The first 15.14 mu s simulation (physiological pH) is compared to available non-PFF long-timescale simulation data. A detailed clustering analysis exhibits striking differences between FFs, with AMOEBA showing a richer conformational space. Focusing on key structural markers related to the oxyanion hole stability, we observe an asymmetry between protomers. One of them appears less structured resembling the experimentally inactive monomer for which a 6 mu s simulation was performed as a basis for comparison. Results highlight the plasticity of the M-pro active site. The C-terminal end of its less structured protomer is shown to oscillate between several states, being able to interact with the other protomer, potentially modulating its activity. Active and distal site volumes are found to be larger in the most active protomer within our AMOEBA simulations compared to non-PFFs as additional cryptic pockets are uncovered. A second 17 mu s AMOEBA simulation is performed with protonated His172 residues mimicking lower pH. Data show the protonation impact on the destructuring of the oxyanion loop. We finally analyze the solvation patterns around key histidine residues. The confined AMOEBA polarizable water molecules are able to explore a wide range of dipole moments, going beyond bulk values, leading to a water molecule count consistent with experimental data. Results suggest that the use of PFFs could be critical in drug discovery to accurately model the complexity of the molecular interactions structuring M-pro.","Inizan, T.

The present study explored risk factors associated with parenting stress and implications for children's emotion regulation in families with different socioeconomic risks. Parents of 2-14 years old children completed a survey reporting difficulties experienced due to the lockdown, level of household chaos, parenting stress, parent involvement in the child's daily life, and children emotion regulation competences. The general mean levels of parenting stress and children emotion regulation abilities were not at clinical level compared with Italian norms. Household chaos predicted higher levels of parenting stress, which, in turn, was associated with less effective emotion regulation in children through the mediating role of parental involvement. More stressed parents were less involved in their children's activities, decreasing children's effective emotion regulation. Only for SES no-risk families, the lockdown constraints increased parenting stress. For SES at-risk families, the impact of parenting stress and involvement on children regulation strategies was stronger, with a protective role played by parental involvement on children's negativity not evident for SES no-risk families. Dealing with the lockdown is a stressful experience for parents who have to balance personal life, work, and children upbringing, without other help. This situation potentially impairs their ability to be supportive caregivers and is consequently detrimental for children well-being. Policies should take into consideration the implications of the lockdown for families' mental health and tailor supportive interventions according to family's risk factors.","Spinelli, Maria; Lionetti, Francesca; Setti, Annalisa; Fasolo, Mirco",Fam. process,155,1

We extend trainable infinite impulse response (IIR) filters to the hyperconditioned case, in which a transformation is learned to directly map external parameters of the distortion effect to its internal filter and gain parameters, along with activations necessary to ensure filter stability. We propose a novel, efficient training scheme of IIR filters by means of a Fourier transform. Our models have significantly fewer parameters and reduced complexity relative to more traditional black-box neural audio effect modeling methodologies using finite impulse response filters. Our smallest, best-performing model adequately models a BOSS MT-2 pedal at 44.1 kHz, using a total of 40 biquads and only 210 parameters. Its model parameters are interpretable, can be related back to the original analog audio circuit, and can even be intuitively altered by machine learning non-specialists after model training. Quantitative and qualitative results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","Nercessian, Shahan; Sarroff, Andy; Werner, Kurt James",,155,1

(Special Issue: COVID-19.),13.552643,7.196973,2020,"Background: In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. So far, it has caused ~ 4000 deaths in this country. We aimed to systematically characterize clinical features and determine risk factors of sudden death for COVID-19 patients. Methods: Deceased patients with COVID-19 in Tongji hospital from January 22 to March 23, 2020 were extracted. Patients who died within 24 hours after admission were identified as sudden deaths, and the others formed non-sudden deaths. The differences in clinical characteristics between the two groups were estimated. Risk factors associated with sudden deaths were explored by logistic regression. Results: 281 deceased patients were enrolled in this study. Sudden death occurred in 28 (10.0%) patients, including 4 (14.3%) admitted to the intensive care unit. Fatigue was more common in sudden deaths (11, 47.8%) than in non-sudden deaths (40, 17.2%). Both the count and percentage of eosinophils were lower in sudden deaths than that in non-sudden deaths (P = 0.006 and P = 0.004). Compared with non-sudden deaths, sudden deaths had higher plasma levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. There were not significant differences in gender, age, chest CT image features and comorbidities observed. Conclusions: The differences between the two groups suggested more severe systemic inflammation, multi-organ dysfunction, especially impaired liver and heart function in COVID-19 patients who died suddenly after admission. More researches are needed to verify these points.","Yang, Nan; Tian, Kunming; Jin, Meng; Zhang, Xu; Zhang, Fengqin; Shi, Xiuquan; Wang, Xiaoyang; Niu, Siyuan; Shi, Jing; Hu, Ke; Liu, Kui; Peng, Ping; Wang, Ying; Zhang, Huilan; Tian, Jianbo",J Glob Health,155,1

These systems are accurate and effective, but also costly, time-consuming, high-technological, infrastructure-dependent, and currently suffer from commercial reagent supply shortages. The reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) can be used as an alternative testing method. Here, we present a novel versatile (real-time and colorimetric) RT-LAMP for the simple (one-step), affordable (~1.7 /sample), and rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 targeting both ORF1ab and N genes of the novel virus genome. We demonstrate the assay on RT-qPCR-positive clinical samples, obtaining most positive results under 25 min. In addition, a novel 30-min one-step drying protocol has been developed to stabilize the RT-LAMP reaction mixtures, allowing them to be stored at room temperature functionally for up to two months, as predicted by the Q10. This Dry-RT-LAMP methodology is suitable for potentially ready-to-use COVID-19 diagnosis. After further testing and validation, it could be easily applied both in developed and in low-income countries yielding rapid and reliable results.","García-Bernalt Diego, Juan; Fernández-Soto, Pedro; Domínguez-Gil, Marta; Belhassen-García, Moncef; Bellido, Juan Luis Muñoz; Muro, Antonio",Diagnostics (Basel),155,33

In the US, COVID-19 outbreaks were first identified in the New York City and Cook County jails, with infection rates far exceeding community rates. Each day new cases are being identified across the country in correctional facilities. People who are incarcerated are at increased risk of experiencing severe COVID-19 symptoms because of the increased prevalence of other underlying illnesses. Jails and prisons have begun initiating facility-level policies to help stop the spread of COVID-19. As a result, correctional agencies have reoriented staff to stem transmission in their facilities. This could translate into limited resources for other programming such as medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) programs. In this commentary, we highlight risk mitigation practices for delivering MOUD in correctional settings during COVID-19 and note how to ensure quality of care while still preparing for the possibility of future pandemics.","Zaller, Nickolas; Brinkley-Rubinstein, Lauren",J Addict Med,155,11

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective, observational, cohort study included patients with COVID-19 symptoms presenting to the emergency department over a two-month period. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and the data of all-cause mortality within 30 days after admission were noted, and the Rapid Emergency Medicine Score and the Rapid Acute Physiology Score were calculated by the researchers. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine the discriminative ability of the scores. RESULTS: A total of 555 patients with a mean of age of 49.4 ± 16.8 years were included in the study. The rate of 30-day mortality was 3.9% for the whole study cohort, 7.2% for the patients with a positive rt-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2, and 1.2% for those with a negative rt-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2. In the group of patients with COVID-19 symptoms, according to the best Youden's index, the cut-off value for the Rapid Emergency Medicine Score was determined as 3.5 (sensitivity: 81.82%, specificity: 73.08%), and the area under curve (AUC) value was 0.840 (95% confidence interval 0.768-0.913). In the same group, according to the best Youden's index, the cut-off value for the Rapid Acute Physiology Score was 2.5 (sensitivity: 90.9%, specificity: 97.38%), and the AUC value was 0.519 (95% confidence interval 0.393-0.646). CONCLUSION: REMS is able to predict patients with COVID-19-like symptoms without positive rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 that are at a high-risk of 30-day mortality.

Here, we characterized the cytokine/chemokine expression profiles of immunocompetent patients complicated with ARDS during HAdV infection and identified biomarkers for disease severity/progression. Forty-eight cytokines/chemokines in the plasma samples from 19 HAdV-infected immunocompetent adolescent and adult patients (ten complicated with ARDS) were measured and analyzed in combination with clinical indices. Immunocompetent patients with ARDS caused by severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, 2009 pandemic H1N1 (panH1N1) or bacteria were included for comparative analyses. Similar indices of disease course/progression were found in immunocompetent patients with ARDS caused by HAdV, SARS-CoV-2 or panH1N infections, whereas the HAdV-infected group showed a higher prevalence of viremia, as well as increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK). Expression levels of 33 cytokines/chemokines were increased significantly in HAdV-infected patients with ARDS compared with that in healthy controls, and many of them were also significantly higher than those in SARS-CoV-2-infected and panH1N1-infected patients. Expression of interferon (IFN)-Î³, interleukin (IL)-1ß, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), monokine induced by IFN-Î³ (MIG), IL-6, macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), IL-10, IL-1&#945; and IL-2Ra was significantly higher in HAdV-infected patients with ARDS than that in those without ARDS, and negatively associated with the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2). Analyses of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) showed that expression of IL-10, M-CSF, MIG, HGF, IL-1ß, IFN-Î³ and IL-2Ra could predict the progression of HAdV infection, with the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.944 obtained for IL-10. Of note, the AUC value for the combination of IL-10, IFN-Î³, and M-CSF reached 1.

The study design is a descriptive and correlational research that compares the frequency of the implementation of Flipped Classroom before and during social distancing. This information is provided by the participants, university professors from the Faculty of Education Sciences of the University of Malaga, through an ad hoc questionnaire. The results reveal a significant increase in the frequency of Flipped Classroom sessions (z = −4.80;p &lt;.001) during the lockdown. The data also show a significant increase in the quantity and variety of didactic resources (t = −2.390;p = 0.021), mainly those related to Flipped Classroom, with video (z = −2.860, p = 0.004) and audio (z = −2.049, p = 0.040) files. University professors consider virtual teaching during the lockdown an opportunity for Flipped Classroom and digital skills that could improve the quality of university educational methodology.","Collado-Valero, Joshua Rodríguez-Infante Gemma Romero-González Marta Gamboa-Ternero Sara Navarro-Soria Ignasi Lavigne-Cerván Rocío",Sustainability,155,29

Patients were divided into four groups depending on whether they were on anticoagulation prior to admission, started anticoagulation during the admission, received prophylactic anticoagulation, or did not receive any anticoagulation. At the time of analysis, 325 patients (35.3%) had died, while 544 patients (59%) had been discharged resulting in inpatient mortality of 37.3%. Male sex, age > 65 years, and high D-dimer at admission were associated with higher mortality. Sixteen patients (1.7%) had venous thromboembolism confirmed with imaging, 11 patients had a stroke, and 2 patients developed limb ischemia. Treatment with therapeutic anticoagulation was associated with improved inpatient mortality compared with prophylactic anticoagulation alone (63% vs 86.2%, p < 0.0001) in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Other outcomes such as rates of liberation from mechanical ventilation and duration of mechanical ventilation were not significantly impacted by the type of anticoagulation.","Hanif, Ahmad; Khan, Sumera; Mantri, Nikhitha; Hanif, Sana; Saleh, Muhamed; Alla, Yamini; Chinta, Siddharth; Shrestha, Nikee; Ji, Wenyan; Attwood, Kristopher; Adrish, Muhammad; Jain, Kevin R",Ann Hematol,155,16

Given that 41% of all young persons are enrolled in universities, and the increased vulnerabilities faced by SGM young persons during the pandemic, it is imperative to understand the effects of alcohol use on mental health among SGM university students amid COVID-19. This study aims to examine the associations between changes in alcohol use since the start of COVID-19 and mental distress among SGM university students in the U.S., and to explore sex-stratified differences. METHODS: A nonprobability cross-sectional sample of 509 SGM university students (Mage = 22.04 years, SD = 3.99) were retrospectively surveyed online between May-August 2020 and asked if their alcohol use had changed since the start of COVID-19. Statistical analyses explored the association between changes in alcohol use since the start of COVID-19 and mental distress. RESULTS: Average psychological distress (M = 27.79, SD = 7.82) was relatively high as per existing research and established clinical cutoff scores. Roughly 32% had increased alcohol use since the start of COVID-19. Subsequently, greater alcohol use (p < .05) since the start of COVID-19 was associated with higher psychological distress among SGM university students, and among females but not males assigned at birth. CONCLUSIONS: Higher education, medical, and behavioral health professionals should consider how to adapt their practice to address alcohol use and psychological burdens among SGM university students (especially females) who are facing health inequities during and beyond COVID-19, requiring SGM-affirmative care.","Salerno, John P; Shrader, Cho-Hee; Algarin, Angel B; Lee, Ji-Young; Fish, Jessica N",Drug Alcohol Depend,155,16

METHODS: We conducted a quality-improvement initiative from May 28-June 25, 2020, during the first 4 weeks of universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in the Barnes-Jewish Hospital labor and delivery unit. All consecutive patients presenting for delivery without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms were offered testing over four 1-week phases. Phase I documented the rate of testing uptake. Phase II recorded patients' reasons for declining testing. Phase III used phase II findings to create and implement shared decision-making tools. Phase IV offered each patient who declined nasopharyngeal testing an oropharyngeal alternative. The primary outcome was rate of SARS-CoV-2 testing uptake by phase. RESULTS: Of 270 patients, 223 (83%) accepted testing and 47 (17%) declined. Maternal age and mode of delivery were similar between groups, whereas testing uptake was higher among nulliparous, White, Hispanic, or privately insured patients. There was a significant increase in the primary outcome of SARS-CoV-2 testing across phases I-IV, from 68% to 76% to 94% to 95%, respectively (Somers' D 0.45; 95% CI of association 0.30-0.59). The most commonly cited reason for declining testing was concern regarding testing discomfort. In subgroup analyses by race and insurance type, there was a significant increase in testing uptake across phases I-IV for Black patients (56%, 54%, 91%, 92%; Somers' D 0.36; 95% CI of association 0.28-0.64), White patients (76%, 93%, 96%, 100%; Somers' D 0.59; 95% CI of association 0.38-0.8), those with Medicaid insurance (60%, 64%, 88%, 92%; 95%; Somers' D 0.39; CI of association 0.22 to 0.56), and those with private insurance (77%, 96%, 97%, 100%; Somers' D 0.63; 95% CI of association 0.40-0.86). CONCLUSION: Universal SARS-CoV-2 testing uptake significantly increased through a rapid-cycle improvement initiative. Aligning hospital policy with patient-centered approaches led to nearly universally acceptable testing.","Kernberg, Annessa; Kelly, Jeannie; Nazeer, Sarah; Russell, Sharman; Tuuli, Methodius; Stout, Molly J; Raghuraman, Nandini; Carter, Ebony B",Obstet Gynecol,155,26

Our research aimed to investigate the relationship between perceived stress and emotional distress during the initial outbreak. Furthermore, potential risks and protective factors, i.e., coping and boredom proneness, of stress-related emotional distress were also explored. Data from 3233 participants in China were collected through an online survey platform during the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 from January 31 to February 9 in 2020. Results showed that higher perceived stress was associated with more emotional distress including depression, fear, compulsion-anxiety, neurasthenia, and hypochondria. Boredom proneness significantly and positively mediated the relationship between perceived stress and emotional distress. Moreover, coping style moderated the stress-emotional distress relationship, i.e., individuals who mainly adopted positive coping strategies suffered fewer symptoms of depression, compulsion-anxiety, and neurasthenia under stress, while negative coping strategies aggravated emotional distress.

Little is known on whether and how patients regain the lost weight. We assessed changes in weight and abdominal adiposity over a three-month follow-up after discharge in COVID-19 survivors. METHODS: In this sub-study of a large prospective observational investigation, we collected data from individuals who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 and re-evaluated at one (V1) and three (V2) months after discharge. Patient characteristics upon admission and anthropometrics, waist circumference and hunger levels assessed during follow-up were analyzed across BMI categories. RESULTS: One-hundred-eighty-five COVID-19 survivors (71% male, median age 62.1 [54.3; 72.1] years, 80% with overweight/obesity) were included. Median BMI did not change from admission to V1 in normal weight subjects (-0.5 [-1.2; 0.6] kg/m2, p = 0.08), but significantly decreased in subjects with overweight (-0.8 [-1.8; 0.3] kg/m2, p < 0.001) or obesity (-1.38 [-3.4; -0.3] kg/m2, p < 0.001; p < 0.05 vs. normal weight or obesity). Median BMI did not change from V1 to V2 in normal weight individuals (+0.26 [-0.34; 1.15] kg/m2, p = 0.12), but significantly increased in subjects with overweight (+0.4 [0.0; 1.0] kg/m2, p < 0.001) or obesity (+0.89 [0.0; 1.6] kg/m2, p < 0.001; p = 0.01 vs. normal weight).

Parents who had reported on their sexist attitudes and aggressive behavior toward intimate partners and children prior to the COVID-19 pandemic completed assessments of aggressive behavior toward their partners and children during the lockdown (N = 362 parents of which 310 were drawn from the same family). Accounting for pre-lockdown levels of aggression, men who more strongly endorsed hostile sexism reported greater aggressive behavior toward their intimate partners and their children during the lockdown. The contextual factors that help explain these longitudinal associations differed across targets of family-based aggression. Men's hostile sexism predicted greater aggression toward intimate partners when men experienced low power during couples' interactions, whereas men's hostile sexism predicted greater aggressive parenting when men reported lower partner-child relationship quality. Novel effects also emerged for benevolent sexism. Men's higher benevolent sexism predicted lower aggressive parenting, and women's higher benevolent sexism predicted greater aggressive behavior toward partners, irrespective of power and relationship quality. The current study provides the first longitudinal demonstration that men's hostile sexism predicts residual changes in aggression toward both intimate partners and children. Such aggressive behavior will intensify the health, well-being, and developmental costs of the pandemic, highlighting the importance of targeting power-related gender role beliefs when screening for aggression risk and delivering therapeutic and education interventions as families face the unprecedented challenges of COVID-19.

In the state of North Rhine-Westphalia closures took place on March 16, 2020 and were gradually eased from end of April 2020 until beginning of June 2020. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 among children and adolescents during the reopening period of schools and day care facilities in Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It further depicts medical history and results of physical examinations of pediatric patients undergoing a test for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was carried out by a naso- and / or oropharyngeal swab by local pediatricians at the time of presentation. Samples were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Medical history and physical examination results were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: 525 children and adolescents presented mainly with mild upper respiratory tract infections. Three patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Their medical history and examination results did not stand out from the other patients. CONCLUSION: A precautious stepwise opening of schools and day care facilities was not associated with the occurrence of a relevant prevalence of COVID-19 among children and adolescents. However, a low general prevalence of COVID-19 at the end of the observation period has to be taken into account. Systematic testing might enable adjusted regulations in favor of full closures, especially in the light of increasing evidence for pediatric patients constituting a low-risk group for COVID-19.","Körner, Robert Walter; Weber, Lutz Thorsten",Klin. paediatr,155,1

However, the role of social media use in depression and suicidal ideation of the general public remains unclear. Related empirical studies were limited and reported inconsistent findings. Little is known about the potential underlying mechanisms that may illustrate the relationship between social media use and depression and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study tested the mediation effects of social loneliness and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms on the relationship between social media use and depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, as well as the moderation effect of age on the mediation models. METHODS: We administered a population-based random telephone survey in May and June 2020, when infection control measures were being vigorously implemented in Hong Kong. A total of 1070 adults (658 social media users and 412 nonusers) completed the survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and multigroup SEM were conducted to test the mediation and moderation effects. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of probable depression was 11.6%; 1.6% had suicidal ideation in the past 2 weeks. Both moderated mediation models of depressive symptoms (&#967;262=335.3; P<.05; comparative fit index [CFI]=0.94; nonnormed fit index [NNFI]=0.92; root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA]=0.06) and suicidal ideation (&#967;234=50.8; P<.05; CFI=0.99; NNFI=0.99; RMSEA=0.02) showed acceptable model fit. There was a significantly negative direct effect of social media use on depressive symptoms among older people (ß=-.07; P=.04) but not among younger people (ß=.04; P=.55). The indirect effect via PTSD symptoms was significantly positive among both younger people (ß=.09; P=.02) and older people (ß=.10; P=.01). The indirect effect via social loneliness was significant among older people (ß=-.01; P=.04) but not among younger people (ß=.01; P=.31). The direct effect of social media use on suicidal ideation was not statistically significant in either age group (P>.05). The indirect effects via PTSD symptoms were statistically significant among younger people (ß=.02; P=.04) and older people (ß=.03; P=.01). Social loneliness was not a significant mediator between social media use and suicidal ideation among either age group (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: Social media may be a ""double-edged sword"" for psychosocial well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, and its roles vary across age groups. The mediators identified in this study can be addressed by psychological interventions to prevent severe mental health problems during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yang, Xue; Yip, Benjamin H K; Mak, Arthur D P; Zhang, Dexing; Lee, Eric K P; Wong, Samuel Y S",JMIR Public Health Surveill,155,24

Within these groups, we explored the level of excess mortality in 2020 by estimating expected mortality with Poisson regression and compared it to observed levels. We investigated if excess mortality has been of the same magnitude in the three groups, and if age constitutes a risk factor for death during the pandemic regardless of level of care. Findings: Individuals living in care homes experienced the highest excess mortality (75- &gt;100% in April, 25-50% in May, 0-25% in June, depending on age). Individuals with home care showed the second highest magnitude (30-60% in April, 15-40% in May, 0-25% in June), while individuals in independent living experienced excess primarily at the highest ages (5-50% in April, 5-50% in May, 0-25% in June). Although mortality rates increased, the age-pattern of mortality during the pandemic resembled the age-pattern observed in previous years. Interpretation: We found stepwise elevated excess mortality by level of care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden, suggesting that level of frailty or comorbidities plays a more important role than age for COVID-19 associated deaths. Part of our findings are likely attributable to differences in exposure to the virus between individuals receiving formal care and those living independently, and not only different case fatality between the groups. Although age is a strong predictor for mortality, the relative effect of age on mortality was no different during the pandemic than before. We believe this is an important contribution to the discussion of the pandemic, its consequences, and which groups need the most protection. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

The latter is essentially biological software that can be rapidly designed and generated, with an extensive catalog of applications. This review aims to highlight the mechanisms of action by which RNA-based drugs can affect specific gene targets and how RNA drugs can be employed to treat cardiovascular disease, with the focus on the therapeutics being evaluated in clinical trials. The recent advances in nanotechnology aiding the translation of such therapies into the clinic are also discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: There is a growing body of studies demonstrating utility of RNA for targeting previously 'undruggable' pathways involved in development and progression of cardiovascular disease. Some challenges in RNA delivery have been overcome thanks to nanotechnology. There are several RNA-based drugs to treat hypercholesterolemia and myocardial infarction which are currently in clinical trials. SUMMARY: RNA therapeutics is a rapidly emerging field of biotherapeutics based upon a powerful and versatile platform with a nearly unlimited capacity to address unmet clinical needs. These therapeutics are destined to change the standard of care for many diseases, including cardiovascular disease.","Boada, Christian; Sukhovershin, Roman; Pettigrew, Roderic; Cooke, John P",Curr Opin Cardiol,155,1

This virus stirred up and disturbed the lives of the world. Technological improvement has metamorphosed traditional brick-mortar classrooms into electronic virtual teaching-learning systems. The combination of an unprecedented growth in smart phone and tablet usage during the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant lockdowns have created a gulf between the teachers and the learners and has facilitated a move towards application-based E-Learning (EL) as a dominating form of Virtual Learning Experience (VLE). The scope of the study is limited to the gratification level towards e-learning and perceptions towards VLE of undergraduate students of Mumbai Metro region. The Primary data was collected from 308 undergraduate students through a systematic convenient random sampling method. When the data was passed through descriptive Statistics and inferences analysis, an undeniable fact was thrown light that the e-learning has paved a way for innovative learning experience for better understanding and self-actualized knowledge of the subjects. There was a significant difference in perceptions of learners towards VLE. Further, it is also inferred that there is no significant correlation between gender and e-learning. The findings would be valuable for Virtual Learning Experience to build up an open innovation policy to further shape the field of scientific knowledge for the successful working of the education under conditions of absolute vulnerability.

Within an inevitable revamping attention on the need for government intervention to face the challenges raised by the Covid19 pandemic, industrial policy is appearing as a central piece of the puzzle. As production dynamics in every country is highly affected by the crisis, industrial policy is considered part of the response to solve dramatic economic and social problems deriving by extraordinary levels of unemployment, deprivation and poverty. In this paper, we argue that a turning point on the connection between industrial policy, sustainability and development has been reached, highlighting the need to rethink its theoretical foundations as well as its governance and implementation processes for a new role in our post-Covid 19 societies. Therefore, the research question underlying this paper deals primarily with the nexus between the debate on industrial policy and its effects in terms of human development, social cohesion and sustainability. For this reason, we attempt at closing the gap between different strands of literature, whose integrated connection leads to a new analytical framework with real-world implications on the role of industrial policy, not only as tool for productive dynamics, but also as a leverage for sustainable human development. All in all, we aim at contributing to the debate on our post-Covid19 economies and societies in two ways: firstly, by providing a new integrated analytical framework on industrial policy to steer a sustainable structural change of our economies and societies towards sustainable human development; secondly, by identifying preliminary implications on industrial policy governance and implementation, investing in the accurate and transparent design of industrial policy in the post-Covid19 era.","Ferrannini, Andrea; Barbieri, Elisa; Biggeri, Mario; Di Tommaso, Marco R",World Dev,155,10

The preventive behaviors of individuals (e.g., home quarantine, disinfection, and wearing masks) play a key role in preserving and controlling the disease. In this case, as a motivational psychological system oriented toward avoiding infection, the behavioral immune system (BIS) may be activated and link to preventive behaviors. This study investigated the mechanisms through which emotional and cognitive processes resulted by BIS have promoted preventive behaviors in relation to COVID-19. We collected data on 22,005 active Sina Weibo users from 31 December 2019 to 8 February 2020 to measure their emotions (including disgust, happiness, and fear), cultural values (individualism and collectivism), moral concern (including purity vice, fairness vice, and authority virtue), and behavioral intentions (including isolation intention, protection intention, and aid intention) using Text Mind software and related dictionaries. Multiple regression and mediation analyses were performed to explore the relationships among variables. The results showed seven complete mediation paths (such as disgust-purity vice-protection intention). Each of these paths describes the effects of cognitive processes caused by BIS on preventive behaviors. We inferred that there may be path mechanisms such as disgust-cognitive processes-preventive behaviors. Using these results, policy makers can take appropriate measures to intervene in preventive behaviors (e.g., by posting disgusting images on social media to evoke disgust). The results can be used to explain differences in preventive behaviors among populations even in the face of similar thread levels. Furthermore, our research provides empirical evidence for the hypothesis of pathogen prevalence.","Liu, Zeyu; Geng, Huijun; Chen, Hao; Zhu, Meng; Zhu, Tingshao",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),155,15

Serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing are needed for detection of current or past infections. A wide range of commercial tests is available. However, most of them need to be validated. STUDY DESIGN: The aim was to compare a commercial IgG and IgA ELISA (Euroimmun) with three lateral flow immunoassays (LFI): Hangzhou Alltest Biotech, Wuhan UNscience Biotechnology and Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech. Specificity was calculated with 62 available serum samples from 2018/19. The study included 152 sera from patients of which 109 were RT-PCR positive. Sensitivities for ELISA anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA were 81.5 % and 93.1 % and specificities 100 % and 80.6 %, respectively. LFI showed variable performances, overall results being better for Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech. CONCLUSIONS: Commercial serological tests are useful for detection of antibodies in patients with COVID-19. ELISA presented better results than LFI. The results allowed to incorporate the most sensitive LFI to the daily workflow, combining with ELISA.

As part of an ongoing vape shop project involving 88 participating shops, this study investigated the number of vape shops that remained open amidst the coronavirus outbreak and related mandates. Examination of shop social media websites and telephone calls to shops revealed that 61.4% (n = 54) have remained open, particularly within Korean/Asian and Hispanic/Latino ethnic locations (32 of the 54 shops). Importantly, walk-in service was much higher within Hispanic/Latino locations compared to African American, Korean/Asian, or non-Hispanic White neighborhoods (p = 0.03). It is not known if shops that stayed open were in direct violation of the order, didn't know all the details of the order, or found a loophole in the order and believed that they were an essential business.

Facilitating professional development (PD) of instructors is crucial for the quality of one’s education system(s), perhaps even more so in times of a pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the authors’ analysis of reviews published in the last decade, this paper summarizes the key building blocks of effective PD on the innovative use of ICT during a pandemic. The authors used these building blocks to reflect on two national PD initiatives developed to support institutions of higher education in instructional use of ICT while dealing with the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: Both PD initiatives include the same building blocks: (1) content-related building blocks focused on technological knowledge, (2) active learning and expert-supported PD (didactics-related building blocks) and (3) contextual building blocks consisting of clearly defined goals focused on the instructor's own practice, use of technology, sustained duration (e.g. taking place over a longer period of time) and evidence-informed PD. One contextual building block that was not evident in the reviews but emerged as a vital building block is “responsiveness” to the situation and needs of the participants. Originality/value: High-quality PD is crucial if one wants to safeguard the quality of (online) instruction and learning to ensure high-quality education for all students. This paper can contribute to enhancing the quality of much-needed PD on online teaching (during, but also after COVID-19).","Schildkamp, Kim; Wopereis, Iwan; Kat-De Jong, Marian; Peet, Annette; Hoetjes, IJsbrand",J.

In 2016, 6 PPC physician-experts in program development and quality improvement (QI) formed a healthcare learning collaborative network entitled the Pediatric Palliative Improvement Network (PPIN). METHODS: The primary drivers identified were 1) Feasibility of a national learning network demonstrated through the completion of one small QI project, 2) Standard education in QI methodology and 3) Salient pediatric palliative care operational, clinical and satisfaction metrics clearly defined. RESULTS: PPIN now includes146 members representing 51 organizations. In 2019 the group completed a national collaborative QI project focused on pain assessment at the time of initial consult, demonstrating a national increase in pain assessment from 75.8% to >90% over 12 months. PPIN has hosted two national QI workshops training more than 50 PPC clinicians in QI, with a 2-hour webinar provided in 2020 due to COVID. Monthly calls since 2017 provide QI methods ""refreshers"", share local works in progress, and provide infrastructure for future collaborative projects. CONCLUSIONS: PPIN has become a sustainable organization which improves the quality of PPC through focus on national QI methods training, successful collaborative projects, and the creation of a learning and peer support community with regular calls. With the advent of the Palliative Care Quality Collaborative in 2020, PPIN provides critical educational and organizational infrastructure to inform ongoing quality efforts in PPC, now and in the future.","Thienprayoon, Rachel; Jones, Emma; Humphrey, Lisa; Ragsdale, Lindsay; Williams, Conrad; Klick, Jeffrey C",J. pain symptom manage,155,18

Although infection with SARS-CoV-2 is usually mild in children, some children later develop a severe inflammatory disease that can have manifestations similar to toxic shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease. This syndrome has been defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). Although the prevalence is unknown, there have been more than 300 cases reported in the literature. MIS-C appears to be more common in Black and Hispanic children in the US. MIS-C typically occurs a few weeks after acute infection and the putative etiology is a dysregulated inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Persistent fever and gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common symptoms. Cardiac manifestations are common including ventricular dysfunction, coronary artery dilation and aneurysms, arrhythmia and conduction abnormalities. Severe cases can present in vasodilatory or cardiogenic shock requiring fluid resuscitation, inotropic support, and in the most severe cases mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Empiric treatments have aimed at reversing the inflammatory response using immunomodulatory medications. Intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids and other immunomodulatory agents have been frequently used. Most patients recover within days to a couple of weeks and mortality is rare, although the medium- and long-term sequelae, particularly cardiovascular complications, are not yet known. This review describes the published data on MIS-C, focusing on cardiac complications, and provides clinical considerations for cardiac evaluation and follow-up.","Alsaied, Tarek; Tremoulet, Adriana H; Burns, Jane C; Saidi, Arwa; Dionne, Audrey; Lang, Sean M; Newburger, Jane W; de Ferranti, Sarah; Friedman, Kevin G",Circulation,155,27

The aim of this study was to use social listening technique to explore unfiltered public perceptions of the professionals involved in healthcare teams during the COVID-19 pandemic, in a naturalistic online setting, and to elaborate on the emotional reactions in response to an online social media post. A cross-sectional retrospective review of comments on a specific social media post was conducted between 15 March and 28 April 2020 using summative content analysis. One image that was widely circulated on social media platforms with two questions: 'Who society thinks works at hospital? versus who really works at hospitals?' was selected. Three platforms were searched, Facebook®, Twitter®, and LinkedIn®. Only publicly available posts were included. Out of the initial 40 posts identified, 21 posts which had 1759 comments were analysed and 1576 were included for coding. Of the emerging nine themes, perceptions of who is in the team was the largest (40.5%, n = 639), followed by agreement (23.1%, n = 364) and feeling excluded (16.2%, n = 255). Of emotional expressions, 42.1% were positive and 57.9% negative. The most frequent emotions were frustration (54.4%, n = 857) followed by gratitude (16.3%, n = 257) and relief (15.9%, n = 250). The post brought considerable attention to the role of the interprofessional team and generated many feelings of frustration and exclusion. For this reason, the response to this social media post is very important and not to be overlooked. Healthcare professionals need to work together to strengthen their presence as an interprofessional team, united to deliver safe effective quality care for patients. The current COVID-19 pandemic and the media attention should be taken as an opportunity by the interprofessional community to work together to combat negative media stereotypes. Further research is warranted on public perceptions of the healthcare team.","El-Awaisi, Alla; O039,; Carroll, Veronica; Koraysh, Somaya; Koummich, Sarra; Huber, Marion",J Interprof Care,155,26

To control the infection, identifying and separating the infected people is the most crucial step. The main diagnostic tool is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Still, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test is not high enough to effectively prevent the pandemic. The chest CT scan test provides a valuable complementary tool to the RT-PCR test, and it can identify the patients in the early-stage with high sensitivity. However, the chest CT scan test is usually time-consuming, requiring about 21.5 minutes per case. This paper develops a novel Joint Classification and Segmentation (JCS) system to perform real-time and explainable COVID- 19 chest CT diagnosis. To train our JCS system, we construct a large scale COVID- 19 Classification and Segmentation (COVID-CS) dataset, with 144,167 chest CT images of 400 COVID- 19 patients and 350 uninfected cases. 3,855 chest CT images of 200 patients are annotated with fine-grained pixel-level labels of opacifications, which are increased attenuation of the lung parenchyma. We also have annotated lesion counts, opacification areas, and locations and thus benefit various diagnosis aspects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed JCS diagnosis system is very efficient for COVID-19 classification and segmentation. It obtains an average sensitivity of 95.0% and a specificity of 93.0% on the classification test set, and 78.5% Dice score on the segmentation test set of our COVID-CS dataset. The COVID-CS dataset and code are available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/JCS.","Wu, Yu-Huan; Gao, Shang-Hua; Mei, Jie; Xu, Jun; Fan, Deng-Ping; Zhang, Rong-Guo; Cheng, Ming-Ming",IEEE Trans Image Process,155,17

We demonstrate that importance sampling can be used to reduce the cost of what would otherwise be a computationally challenging analysis. We show that including the physical estimate for the calibration error distribution has negligible impact on the inference of parameters for the events in GWTC-1. Studying a simulated signal with matched filter signal-to-noise ratio $\text{SNR}=200$, we project that a calibration error estimate typical of GWTC-1 is likely to be negligible for the current generation of gravitational-wave detectors. We argue that other sources of systematic error---from waveforms, prior distributions, and noise modelling---are likely to be more important. Finally, using the events in GWTC-1 as standard sirens, we infer an astrophysically-informed improvement on the estimate of the calibration error in the LIGO interferometers.","Payne, Ethan; Talbot, Colm; Lasky, Paul D.; Thrane, Eric; Kissel, Jeffrey S.",,155,11

Little is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and well-being of youth with chronic pain and their families. We conducted a longitudinal, mixed-methods study to characterize early adaptation to the COVID-19 pandemic among 250 families of youth (ages 12-21 years) diagnosed with chronic headache (64%) or other chronic pain conditions (36%) and to determine whether direct exposures to COVID-19 and secondary economic stress modified symptom trajectories. Youth and parents reported on pain interference, anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms at 4 waves of data collection from April 2020 to July 2020. We also collected qualitative data on the impact of the pandemic on the youth's pain problem. Nearly half of our sample (49.6%) experienced direct exposures to COVID-19. Secondary economic stress was also common, affecting 44.4% of families. Symptom trajectories for pain, insomnia, depression, and anxiety remained stable or improved for most participants, indicating adaptive adjustment. However, overall symptom burden was high with persistent and clinically elevated depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms common among youth and parents. Direct exposures to COVID-19 did not modify symptom trajectories. However, youth pain interference and parent insomnia worsened in families who experienced secondary economic stress. Qualitative data revealed perceived benefits and harms from school closures on the youth's pain problem. Our findings of high symptom burden suggest that pediatric pain clinicians should offer distance assessment and treatment (eg, through telemedicine) to avoid pandemic-related disruptions in pain care.","Law, Emily F; Zhou, Chuan; Seung, Fiona; Perry, Frankie; Palermo, Tonya M",Pain,155,16

The main characteristics of respondents who played or did not play during lockdown are also investigated. This study is embedded in an ongoing longitudinal study that examines the gambling behavior of casino players at three points in time. All respondents who had participated in the first wave of the longitudinal study by the cut-off date (15th March 2020) were asked about their gambling behavior during lockdown in a supplementary online survey three weeks after the end of lockdown. A total of 55% of the 110 respondents reported having played during lockdown. Gambling intensity significantly decreased (p < 0.001) in our sample. Considering only those respondents (n = 66) who reported having gambled during lockdown, gambling intensity also decreased (p < 0.001), but online gambling significantly increased (p < 0.002). Those players who have increased their gambling activity require particular attention. It is important that casinos respond with appropriate player protection measures to those who have increased their gambling activity during the pandemic.","Lischer, Suzanne; Steffen, Angela; Schwarz, Jürg; Mathys, Jacqueline",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),155,26

However, the diversity and structure of the microbiota, and the assembly mechanisms of root-associated microbial communities of plants are still poorly understood. RESULTS: We invstigated the microbiota of the root endosphere and rhizosphere soils of the rice cultivar Nipponbare (NPB) and its Piz-t-transgenic line (NPB-Piz-t) when infected with the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) isolate KJ201, using 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) amplicon sequencing. The rhizosphere soils showed higher bacterial and fungal richness and diversity than the endosphere except for fungal richness in the rhizosphere soils of the mock treatment. Bacteria richness and diversity increased in the endospheric communities of NPB and Piz-t under inoculation with KJ201 (referred to as 'NPB-KJ201' and 'Piz-t-KJ201', respectively) compared with the corresponding mock treatments, with the NPB-KJ201 showing the highest diversity in the four bacterial endocompartments. In contrast, fungal richness and diversity decreased in the endospheric communities of NPB-KJ201 and Piz-t-KJ201, relative to the corresponding mock treatments, with NPB-KJ201 and Piz-t-KJ201 having the lowest richness and diversity, respectively, across the four fungal endocompartments. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the microbiota of Piz-t-KJ201 of root endophytes were mostly remarkablely distinct from that of NPB-KJ201. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that the phyla Proteobacteria and Ascomycota were the key contributors to the bacterial and fungal communities, respectively. Furthermore, a comparative metabolic analysis showed that the contents of tryptophan metabolism and indole alkaloid biosynthesis were significantly lower in the Piz-t-KJ201 plants. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we compared the diversity, composition, and assembly of microbial communities associated with the rhizosphere soils and endosphere of Piz-t-KJ201 and NPB-KJ201. On the basis of the different compositions, diversities, and assemblies of the microbial communities among different compartments, we propose that the host genotype and inoculation pattern of M. oryzae played dominant roles in determining the microbial community assemblage. Further metabolomics analysis revealed that some metabolites may influence changes in bacterial communities. This study improves our understanding of the complex interactions between rice and M. oryzae, which could be useful in developing new strategies to improve rice resistance through the manipulation of soil microorganisms.","Tian, Dagang; Chen, Zaijie; Lin, Yan; Liang, Tingmin; Chen, Ziqiang; Guo, Xinrui; Wang, Feng; Wang, Zonghua",Rice (N Y),155,15

White matter injury (WMI), a leading cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities in preterm infants, which is characterized by extensive myelination disturbances and demyelination. Neuroinflammation, leads to the loss and differentiation-inhibition of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), represents a major barrier to myelin repair. Whether the novel RIP1/RIP3 dual inhibitor ZJU-37 can promote transplanted OPCs derived from human neural stem cells (hOPCs) survival, differentiation and myelination remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of ZJU-37 on myelination and neurobehavioral function in a neonatal rat WMI model induced by hypoxia and ischemia. METHODS: In vivo, P3 rat pups were subjected to right common carotid artery ligation and hypoxia, and then treated with ZJU-37 or/and hOPCs, then OPCs apoptosis, myelination, glial cell and NLRP3 inflammasome activation together with cognitive outcome were evaluated at 12 weeks after transplantation. In vitro, the effect of ZJU-37 on NLRP3 inflammasome activation in astrocytes induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) were examined by western blot and immunofluorescence. The effect of ZJU-37 on OPCs apoptosis induced by the conditioned medium from OGD-injured astrocytes (OGD-astrocyte-CM) was analyzed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: ZJU-37 combined with hOPCs more effectively decreased OPC apoptosis, promoted myelination in the corpus callosum and improved behavioral function compared to ZJU-37 or hOPCs treatment. In addition, the activation of glial cells and NLRP3 inflammasome was reduced by ZJU-37 or/and hOPCs treatment in the neonatal rat WMI model. In vitro, it was also confirmed that ZJU-37 can suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activation in astrocytes induced by OGD. Not only that, the OGD-astrocyte-CM treated with ZJU-37 obviously attenuated OPC apoptosis and dysdifferentiation caused by the OGD-astrocyte-CM. CONCLUSIONS: The novel RIP1/RIP3 dual inhibitor ZJU-37 may promote OPC survival, differentiation and myelination by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a neonatal rat model of WMI with hOPC graft.","Zhang, Chu; Guan, Qian; Shi, Hao; Cao, Lingsheng; Liu, Jing; Gao, Zixuan; Zhu, Wenxi; Yang, Yinxiang; Luan, Zuo; Yao, Ruiqin",Stem Cell Res Ther,155,16

Lastly, in all sentiment analyses, the sentiment polarities regarding political topics were always the lowest among the five topics of concern across all population groups. CONCLUSIONS: Through large-scale Twitter data mining, this study revealed that meaningful differences regarding concerns and sentiments about COVID-19-related topics existed among population groups during the study period. Therefore, specialized and varied attention and support are needed for different population groups. In addition, the efficient analysis method implemented by our publicly released code can be utilized to dynamically track the evolution of each population group during the pandemic or any other major event for better informed public health research and interventions.","Zhang, Chunyan; Xu, Songhua; Li, Zongfang; Hu, Shunxu",J Med Internet Res,155,20

The use of the anti-interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab (TCZ) has been proposed in this hyperinflammatory phase, although supporting evidence is limited. We retrospectively analyzed 88 consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia that received at least one dose of intravenous TCZ in our institution between 16 and 27 March 2020. Clinical status from day 0 (first TCZ dose) through day 14 was assessed by a 6-point ordinal scale. The primary outcome was clinical improvement (hospital discharge and/or a decrease of &#8805;2 points on the 6-point scale) by day 7. Secondary outcomes included clinical improvement by day 14 and dynamics of vital signs and laboratory values. Rates of clinical improvement by days 7 and 14 were 44.3% (39/88) and 73.9% (65/88). Previous or concomitant receipt of subcutaneous interferon-ß (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.06-0.94; P = .041) and serum lactate dehydrogenase more than 450 U/L at day 0 (aOR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.06-0.99; P = .048) were negatively associated with clinical improvement by day 7. All-cause mortality was 6.8% (6/88). Body temperature and respiratory and cardiac rates significantly decreased by day 1 compared to day 0. Lymphocyte count and pulse oximetry oxygen saturation/FiO2 ratio increased by days 3 and 5, whereas C-reactive protein levels dropped by day 2. There were no TCZ-attributable adverse events. In this observational single-center study, TCZ appeared to be useful and safe as immunomodulatory therapy for severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","Fernández-Ruiz, Mario; López-Medrano, Francisco; Pérez-Jacoiste Asín, María Asunción; Maestro de la Calle, Guillermo; Bueno, Héctor; Caro-Teller, José Manuel; Catalán, Mercedes; de la Calle, Cristina; García-García, Rocío; Gómez, Carlos; Laguna-Goya, Rocío; Lizasoáin, Manuel; Martínez-López, Joaquín; Origüen, Julia; Pablos, José Luis; Ripoll, Mar; San Juan, Rafael; Trujillo, Hernando; Lumbreras, Carlos; Aguado, José María",J. med. virol,155,11

Even though the process of digital transformation of higher education (including law schools) was launched before the Covid-19 pandemic, it was the coronavirus that acted as a catalyst for digitalization of almost all spheres of public life. Universities were faced with the need to create a comfortable and high-quality digital information and educational environment as soon as possible, and many enterprises (including their legal departments) decided to switch for remote work due to the self-isolation regime, which triggered further digitalization of the legal profession. In turn, digitalization of the legal profession can affect the labor market, and, therefore, higher education, as universities must consider the needs of future employers. The authors applied both general methods and methodological techniques (analysis, synthesis, deduction, induction, etc.) and special legal methods (formal legal and comparative legal). While analyzing, the authors conclude that the potential digitalization of legal education is widespread, since it is not only about the use of digital technologies in education, but changing the content of legal education due to digital transformation of the legal profession.","Osina, D.

Transmission of the virus is predominantly direct, through exposure to infected respiratory secretions. As far as we know, arthropods play a key role in the transmission and spread of several viruses, and thus their role in the spread of COVID-19 deserves to be studied. The biological transmission of viral agents through insects is very complex. While mechanical transmission is more likely to happen, biological transmission is possible via blood-sucking arthropods, but this requires a high grade of compatibility between the vector and the pathogen. If the biological and mechanical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by blood-sucking arthropods is excluded, a mechanical transmission by urban pests could take place. This risk is very low but it could be important in isolated environmental conditions, where other means of transmission are not possible. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in non-blood-sucking arthropods in infected buildings, like hospitals and retirement homes, should be investigated.","Dutto, M; Lauria, G; Drago, A; Martini, S; Gorrasi, I; Gilli, G",Ann. ig,155,26

A search strategy involving search terms corresponding to 'health', 'industrial worker', and 'Vietnam' was applied to search for related papers published in English on Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Duplicates were removed, and relevant data were extracted from the full text of remaining publications. Results showed that underlying health problems, including respiratory system problems, were common among industrial workers. Many suffered occupational diseases and/or work-related injuries. Self-treatment (without medication) was the most used method when having health problems (by 28.2% to 51% of participants), followed by visiting commune health centers (24%) and self-medication (20.3%). Findings suggest a high risk of disease spreading among industrial workers and of them suffering more severe conditions when infected. Economic vulnerabilities may be the reason for workers' reluctance to taking time off work to attend hospital/clinic. These imply a need for involving local pharmacies, commune health centers, traditional health providers or village health collaborators as local health gatekeepers who are the first point of detecting and reporting of suspected COVID-19 cases, as well as a channel where accurate information regarding COVID-19, protective equipment, and intervention packages can be delivered.

This study explores the effect of differing processes for Ethics and Governance in the establishment of the CovidSurg-Cancer study during the global COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An anonymous, structured web-based questionnaire was designed using the Research Electronic Data Capture application (REDCap) platform to capture consultant surgeons, fellows, and trainees experience in the ethics application process. 'CovidSurg-Cancer' was an international multicentre collaborative study to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the outcomes of patients undergoing cancer surgery. The ethics process to set up this observational study was used as to explore the differing processes applied across Australia. RESULTS: The CovidSurg-Cancer study was successfully set up in 14 hospitals. Four hospitals approved the study directly as an audit. Of the remaining sites, 10 ethics applications underwent Human Research Ethics Committee review following which two (14%) were subsequently approved as an audit activity and eight hospitals (57%) were given formal ethical approval with waiver of consent. Ethics application acceptance from another Australian Human Research Ethics Committee was provided with six applications; however, only three were reciprocated without the requirement for further agreements. A third of (30%) respondents suggested that the details of the application pathway, process and documentation were unclear. CONCLUSION: Ethics processes are varied across Australia with considerable repetition. A centralized, harmonized application process would enhance collaborative research.","Dudi-Venkata, Nagendra N; Cox, Daniel R A; Marson, Nicholas; Tan, Lorwai; Pockney, Peter; Muralidharan, Vijayaragavan; Watson, David I; Richards, Toby",ANZ j.

While masks are known to prevent transmission towards other individuals, it is unclear if different types of facial masks can protect the user from inhalation. The present study compares in-vitro different commercial and custom-made facial masks at different distances and breathing patterns. METHODS: Masks were placed on a head mannequin connected to a lung simulator, using a collecting filter placed after the mannequin airway. Certified, commercial and custom-made masks were tested at three different distances between the emitter and the mannequin: 40 cm, 80 cm and 120 cm. Two patterns of breathing were used, simulating normal and polypneic respiration. A solution of methylene blue was nebulized with a jet nebulizer and different mask-distance-breathing pattern combinations were tested. The primary endpoint was the inhaled fraction, defined as the amount of methylene blue detected with spectrophotometry expressed as percent of the amount detected in a reference condition of zero distance and no mask. FINDINGS: We observed a significant effect of distance (p < 0.001), pattern of breathing (p = 0.040) and type of mask (p < 0.001) on inhaled fraction. All masks resulted in lower inhaled fraction compared to breathing without mask (p < 0.001 in all comparisons), ranging from 41.1% ± 0.3% obtained with a cotton mask at 40 cm distance with polypneic pattern to <1% for certified FFP3 and the combination of FFP2 + surgical mask at all distances and both breathing pattern conditions. DISCUSSION: Distance, type of device and breathing pattern resulted in highly variable inhaled fraction. While the use of all types of masks resulted relevantly less inhalation compared to distancing alone, only high-grade certified devices (FFP3 and the combination of FFP2 + surgical mask) ensured negligible inhaled fraction in all conditions.","Ball, Lorenzo; Alberti, Stefano; Belfortini, Claudio; Almondo, Chiara; Robba, Chiara; Battaglini, Denise; Cravero, Carlo; Pelosi, Paolo; Caratto, Valentina; Ferretti, Maurizio",PLoS One,155,16

The frustrating thing is that, right now, this virus is still new. It only came to the attention of the World Health Organization at the end of December. Very few cases in thalassemia have so far been reported; is this due to lack of testing or a true lack of infection/susceptibility? However, we believe that more data should be collected to better characterise the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with thalassemias. Therefore, a multicenter registry and the collection of comprehensive data from both positive COVID-19 thalassemia major and non-transfusion dependent thalassemia are necessary to clarify debated issues. In the meantime an early and vigilant monitoring along with high quality supportive care are needed in thalassemic patients at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Karimi, Mehran; De Sanctis, Vincenzo",Acta Biomed,155,30

METHODS: We developed an approach called CNPBayes to identify latent batch effects in genome-wide association studies involving copy number, to provide probabilistic estimates of integer copy number across the estimated batches, and to fully integrate the copy number uncertainty in the association model for disease. RESULTS: Applying a hidden Markov model (HMM) to identify CNVs in a large multi-site Pancreatic Cancer Case Control study (PanC4) of 7598 participants, we found CNV inference was highly sensitive to technical noise that varied appreciably among participants. Applying CNPBayes to this dataset, we found that the major sources of technical variation were linked to sample processing by the centralized laboratory and not the individual study sites. Modeling the latent batch effects at each CNV region hierarchically, we developed probabilistic estimates of copy number that were directly incorporated in a Bayesian regression model for pancreatic cancer risk. Candidate associations aided by this approach include deletions of 8q24 near regulatory elements of the tumor oncogene MYC and of Tumor Suppressor Candidate 3 (TUSC3). CONCLUSIONS: Laboratory effects may not account for the major sources of technical variation in genome-wide association studies. This study provides a robust Bayesian inferential framework for identifying latent batch effects, estimating copy number, and evaluating the role of copy number in heritable diseases.","Cristiano, Stephen; McKean, David; Carey, Jacob; Bracci, Paige; Brennan, Paul; Chou, Michael; Du, Mengmeng; Gallinger, Steven; Goggins, Michael G; Hassan, Manal M; Hung, Rayjean J; Kurtz, Robert C; Li, Donghui; Lu, Lingeng; Neale, Rachel; Olson, Sara; Petersen, Gloria; Rabe, Kari G; Fu, Jack; Risch, Harvey; Rosner, Gary L; Ruczinski, Ingo; Klein, Alison P; Scharpf, Robert B",BMC Cancer,155,1

METHODS: This article is based on a selective literature search in PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov, followed by an assessment of the ongoing clinical trials that were revealed by the search. RESULTS: A number of substances have been found to prevent the reproduction of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. These include virustatic agents that have already been approved for the treatment of other types of viral infection, as well as drugs that are currently used for entirely different purposes. High in vitro activity has been found for the nucleotide analogue remdesivir, for the antimalarial drug chloroquine, and for nitazoxanide, a drug used to treat protozoan infections. Because the virus enters human cells by way of the membrane-associated angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), keeping the virus from docking to this receptor is a conceivable treatment approach. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) plays a role in the fusion of the virus with cells; inhibitors of this enzyme are known as well. The potential therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of these and other active substances remain to be investigated in clinical trials. At present, more than 80 trials on COVID-10 have already been registered with Clinical- Trials.gov. Some initial findings should already be available in late April 2020. CONCLUSION: Clinical trials are now indispensable in order to determine the true clinical benefits and risks of the substances that have been found to be active against SARSCoV- 2 in vitro. There is not yet any recommendation for the therapeutic use of any particular agent beyond standard supportive treatment.","Stahlmann, Ralf; Lode, Hartmut",Dtsch Arztebl Int,155,5

In the current COVID-19 context among older adults in the community, the fear of COVID-19, anxiety symptoms, compassion, resilience, and the practice of protective behaviors are possibly related to each other in several ways. How these factors relate to each other would have important implications in managing the spread of the disease and its mental health consequences. To this end, we modeled their interrelationships using a structural equation model. Older adults (N = 421), aged 60 and above completed various questionnaires-COVID-19 Fear Inventory, Short form of the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory, COVID-19 Risky and Protective Behaviours, Resilience Appraisals Scale, and Compassion Scale during a COVID-19 lockdown. The relationships between these variables were assessed within a structural equation model. The findings showed that older adults who are more compassionate engage in protective behaviors more frequently. Additionally, frequent practice of protective behaviors and greater resilience predicted lower anxiety among older adults. Greater fear predicted higher anxiety levels but did not significantly influence an individual's engagement in protective behaviors. Mental health services are crucial in fostering resilience and supporting older adults psychologically. Social services are also necessary in maintaining and enhancing social support for older adults. Importantly, these findings suggest that public health communications could promote compassion and avoid using a fear-based approach to increase engagement in protective behaviors.","Lim, Xin Ying; Yap, Ai Che; Mahendran, Rathi; Yu, Junhong",Transl Behav Med,155,3

Realizing a comprehensive set of infection prevention measures is a key to minimize the spread of this virus and its impacts in all healthcare settings. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the compliance towards COVID-19 preventive measures and associated factors among health professionals in selected public hospitals, southeast Ethiopia. METHODS: A descriptive hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 660 health professionals in public hospitals of southeast Ethiopia from October 1 to 31, 2020. A multistage sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Data were collected by interview using structured and pretested questionnaires. Ordinary logistic regression modeling was used to estimate the crude and adjusted odds ratio. To declare the statistical significance of factors associated with the outcome variable, P-value < 0.05 and 95% confidence interval were used. RESULTS: A total of 654 health professionals were involved in the study; of whom, 313 participants were nurses. The overall good compliance and knowledge of health professionals regarding COVID-19 preventive measures were 21.6 and 25.5%, respectively. Working in the general hospital (AOR = 0.55; 95% CI 0.38, 0.79), service year (AOR = 2.10; 95% CI 1.35, 3.21), knowledge (AOR = 1.80; 95% CI 1.14, 2.89), and water availability (AOR = 3.26; 95% CI 2.25, 4.72) were some of the factors found to have a statistically significant association to compliance of health professionals regarding COVID-19 preventive measures. CONCLUSION: In this study, nearly one fifth of health professionals had good compliance towards COVID-19 prevention practices. Thus, a consistent supply of COVID-19 prevention materials, facilities, and improving the knowledge of health professionals through on and off-job training are crucial.","Zenbaba, Demisu; Sahiledengle, Biniyam; Takele, Abulie; Tekalegn, Yohannes; Yassin, Ahmed; Tura, Birhanu; Abdulkadir, Adem; Tesa, Edao; Tasew, Alelign; Ganfure, Gemechu; Fikadu, Genet; Seyoum, Kenbon; Abduku, Mohammedawel; Assefa, Tesfaye; Morka, Garoma; Kemal, Makida; Gemechu, Adisu; Bekele, Kebebe; Tessema, Abdi; Haji, Safi; Haile, Gebisa; Girma, Alemu; Mama, Mohammedaman; Negero, Asfaw; Nigussie, Eshetu; Gezahegn, Habtamu; Atlaw, Daniel; Regasa, Tadele; Usman, Heyder; Esmael, Adem",Trop Med Health,155,16

For example, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, related decisions, like whether we need to ask people to use facemasks, is an SSI question being discussed internationally with no right or wrong answer. Controversial issues like SSI and the ability to make informed decisions need to be taught in school, which raises the question of whether teachers themselves are equipped with the skills required to make decisions on SSI. This study aimed to explore whether primary science pre-service teachers could consider multiple subject areas while making decisions on SSI in the context of abortion. Forty-two pre-service primary science teachers (third-year university students) in a genetics and biotechnology course participated in the study. The participants were asked to make decisions about abortion in three genetics-related scenarios and to explain their reasons in written reports. The SEE-SEP (science, environment, ethics/morality, sociology/culture, economy, and policy) model was adopted to explore the reasons behind the pre-service teachers’ decisions. The results showed that their decisions were influenced mainly by science and ethics/morality subject areas. The results further revealed that the participants who supported abortion based their decisions on both scientific evidence and their emotional responses. On the other hand, the pre-service teachers who were against abortion based their decisions on scientific evidence and the aspect of uncertainty. Accordingly, our study recognises the importance of including both science and ethics/morality discussions in SSI-based teaching. The implications for SSI-based teaching and learning are discussed.

While the implementation of these new curricula has been described, an understanding of the impact on student learning outcomes is lacking. In 2020, the authors followed Kern's 6-step approach to curricular development to create and evaluate a novel COVID-19 curriculum for medical students at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine and evaluate its learning outcomes. The primary goal of the curriculum was to provide third- and fourth-year medical students an opportunity for workplace learning in the absence of clinical clerkships, specifically for students to develop clerkship-level milestones in the competency domains of practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and systems-based practice. The curriculum was designed to match students with faculty-mentored projects occurring primarily in virtual formats. A total of 126 students enrolled in the curriculum and completed a survey about their learning outcomes (100% response rate). Of 35 possible clerkship-level milestones, there were 12 milestones for which over half of students reported development, in competency domains including practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and interpersonal and communication skills. Thematic analysis of students' qualitative survey responses demonstrated 2 central motivations for participating in the curriculum: identity as physicians-in-training, and patient engagement. Six central learning areas were developed during the curriculum: interprofessional teamwork, community resources, technology in medicine, skill-building, quality improvement, and specialty-specific learning. This analysis demonstrates that students can develop competencies and achieve rich workplace learning through project-based experiential learning, even in virtual clinical workplaces. Furthermore, knowledge of community resources, technology in medicine, and quality improvement were developed through the curriculum more readily than in traditional clerkships, and could be considered as integral learning objectives in future curricular design.","Castro, Maria R H; Calthorpe, Lucia M; Fogh, Shannon E; McAllister, Sophie; Johnson, Christopher L; Isaacs, Eric D; Ishizaki, Allison; Kozas, Anna; Lo, Daphne; Rennke, Stephanie; Davis, John; Chang, Anna",Acad. med,155,16

Thus, there is an urgent need to identify early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to determine the risk of developing serious illness. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 114 patients with COVID-19 at the Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan based on their clinical and laboratory data. Patients were categorized into severe and mild to moderate disease groups. We analyzed the potential of serological inflammation indicators in predicting the severity of COVID-19 in patients using univariate and multivariate logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic curves, and nomogram analysis. The Spearman method was used to understand the correlation between the serological biomarkers and duration of hospital stay. RESULTS: Patients with severe disease had reduced neutrophils and lymphocytes; severe coagulation dysfunction; altered content of biochemical factors (such as urea, lactate dehydrogenase); elevated high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, neutrophil-lymphocyte, platelet-lymphocyte, and derived neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios, high sensitivity C-reactive protein-prealbumin ratio (HsCPAR), systemic immune-inflammation index, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein-albumin ratio (HsCAR); and low lymphocyte-monocyte ratio, prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and albumin-to-fibrinogen ratio. PNI, HsCAR, and HsCPAR correlated with the risk of severe disease. The nomogram combining the three parameters showed good discrimination with a C-index of 0.873 and reliable calibration. Moreover, HsCAR and HsCPAR correlated with duration of hospital stay.

The transmission of aggregates requires neuron-released Tau to interact with surface receptors on target cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms in astrocytes and downstream effects are unclear. Here, using a spatially resolved proteomic mapping strategy, we show that integrin &#945;V/ß1 receptor binds recombinant human Tau, mediating the entry of Tau fibrils in astrocytes. The binding of distinct Tau species to the astrocytic &#945;V/ß1 receptor differentially activate integrin signaling. Furthermore, Tau-mediated activation of integrin signaling results in NF&#954;B activation, causing upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, induction of a sub-group of neurotoxic astrocytic markers, and release of neurotoxic factors. Our findings suggest that filamentous recombinant human Tau-mediated activation of integrin signaling induces astrocyte conversion towards a neurotoxic state, providing a mechanistic insight into tauopathies.","Wang, Peng; Ye, Yihong",Nat Commun,155,1

This problem results in different type of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among the HHD users. An integrated multi-criteria decision-making approach was offered for identifying the risk level of MSDs among HHD users. A case example implemented the proposed approach in which, firstly, the best-worst method (BWM) technique was used to prioritize and determine the relative importance (weightage) of the risk factors. The weightages of the risk factors further used to rank the seven alternatives (HHD users) using Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) technique. The outcomes of the BWM investigation showed that the three most significant risk factors responsible for MSDs are duration of working, poor working posture and un-ergonomic design. The outcome of the VIKOR technique exhibited that computer professionals were at the highest risk among all users.

In this issue of the JCI, Ganatra et al. explored TB reactivation in the context of ART using TB and simian immunodeficiency virus-coinfected (TB/SIV-coinfected) nonhuman primates. The authors found that treating rhesus macaques with ART restored CD4+ T cells in whole blood, spleen, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, but not in the lung interstitium. TB risk was not decreased in the coinfected macaques treated with ART for 14-63 days, suggesting that ART does not decrease the short-term risk of reactivation. Reactivation occurred as CD4+ T cells were increasing, which is consistent with observations made in humans. This study provides a potential model for systematic evaluation of TB/SIV coinfection and different treatment regimens and strategies to prevent TB reactivation.","Sterling, Timothy R; Lin, Philana Ling",J. clin. invest,155,9

Minimizing social interactions and travel reduces the rate at which the infection spreads and ""flattens the curve"" so that the medical system is better equipped to treat infected individuals. However, it remains unclear how the public will respond to these policies as the pandemic continues. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to present the Twitter Social Mobility Index, a measure of social distancing and travel derived from Twitter data. We used public geolocated Twitter data to measure how much users travel in a given week. METHODS: We collected 469,669,925 tweets geotagged in the United States from January 1, 2019, to April 27, 2020. We analyzed the aggregated mobility variance of a total of 3,768,959 Twitter users at the city and state level from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We found a large reduction (61.83%) in travel in the United States after the implementation of social distancing policies. However, the variance by state was high, ranging from 38.54% to 76.80%. The eight states that had not issued statewide social distancing orders as of the start of April ranked poorly in terms of travel reduction: Arkansas (45), Iowa (37), Nebraska (35), North Dakota (22), South Carolina (38), South Dakota (46), Oklahoma (50), Utah (14), and Wyoming (53). We are presenting our findings on the internet and will continue to update our analysis during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: We observed larger travel reductions in states that were early adopters of social distancing policies and smaller changes in states without such policies. The results were also consistent with those based on other mobility data to a certain extent. Therefore, geolocated tweets are an effective way to track social distancing practices using a public resource, and this tracking may be useful as part of ongoing pandemic response planning.","Xu, Paiheng; Dredze, Mark; Broniatowski, David A",J Med Internet Res,155,16

Pandemic-related restrictions and reorganization of healthcare services may affect thyroid disease management. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To analyze and discuss the relationship between COVID-19 and thyroid diseases from several perspectives. PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus, ClinicalTrial.gov were searched for this purpose by using free text words and medical subject headings as follows: ""sars cov 2"", ""covid 19"", ""subacute thyroiditis"", ""atypical thyroiditis"", ""chronic thyroiditis"", ""hashimoto's thyroiditis"", ""graves' disease"", ""thyroid nodule"", ""differentiated thyroid cancer"", ""medullary thyroid cancer"", ""methimazole"", ""levothyroxine"", ""multikinase inhibitor"", ""remdesivir"", ""tocilizumab"". Data were collected, analyzed, and discussed to answer the following clinical questions: ""What evidence suggests that COVID-19 may induce detrimental consequences on thyroid function?""; ""Could previous or concomitant thyroid diseases deteriorate the prognosis of COVID-19 once the infection has occurred?""; ""Could medical management of thyroid diseases influence the clinical course of COVID-19?""; ""Does medical management of COVID-19 interfere with thyroid function?""; ""Are there defined strategies to better manage endocrine diseases despite restrictive measures and in-hospital and ambulatory activities reorganizations?"". RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 may induce thyroid dysfunction that is usually reversible, including subclinical and atypical thyroiditis. Patients with baseline thyroid diseases are not at higher risk of contracting or transmitting SARS-CoV-2, and baseline thyroid dysfunction does not foster a worse progression of COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether low levels of free triiodothyronine, observed in seriously ill patients with COVID-19, may worsen the disease's clinical progression and, consequently, if triiodothyronine supplementation could be a tool for reducing this burden. Glucocorticoids and heparin may affect thyroid hormone secretion and measurement, respectively, leading to possible misdiagnosis of thyroid dysfunction in severe cases of COVID-19. High-risk thyroid nodules require a fine-needle aspiration without relevant delay, whereas other non-urgent diagnostic procedures and therapeutic interventions should be postponed. DISCUSSION: Currently, we know that SARS-CoV-2 could lead to short-term and reversible thyroid dysfunction, but thyroid diseases seem not to affect the progression of COVID-19. Adequate management of patients with thyroid diseases remains essential during the pandemic, but it could be compromised because of healthcare service restrictions. Endocrine care centers should continuously recognize and classify priority cases for in-person visits and therapeutic procedures.

Novel antiviral therapies are urgently needed to overcome this pandemic. Given the significant role of the main protease of Covid-19 for virus replication, we performed a drug-repurposing study using the recently deposited main protease structure, 6LU7. For instance, pharmacophore- and e-pharmacophore-based hypotheses such as AARRH and AARR, respectively, were developed using available small molecule inhibitors and utilized in the screening of the DrugBank repository. Further, a hierarchical docking protocol was implemented with the support of the Glide algorithm. The resultant compounds were then examined for their binding free energy against the main protease of Covid-19 by means of the Prime-MM/GBSA algorithm. Most importantly, the machine learning-based AutoQSAR algorithm was used to predict the antiviral activities of resultant compounds. The hit molecules were also examined for their drug-likeness and toxicity parameters through the QikProp algorithm. Finally, the hit compounds activity against the main protease was validated using molecular dynamics simulation studies. Overall, the present analysis yielded two potential inhibitors (DB02986 and DB08573) that are predicted to bind with the main protease of Covid-19 better than currently used drug molecules such as N3 (cocrystallized native ligand), lopinavir, and ritonavir.","T, Muthu Kumar; K, Rohini; James, Nivya; V, Shanthi; K, Ramanathan",Biotechnol. appl. biochem,155,16

While highly potent mNAbs have great therapeutic potential, the ability of the virus to mutate and escape recognition and neutralization of mNAbs represents a potential problem in their use for the therapeutic management of SARS-CoV-2. Studies investigating natural or mNAb-induced antigenic variability in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein, and their effects on viral fitness are still rudimentary. In this manuscript we described experimental approaches for the selection, identification, and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody resistant mutants (MARMs) in cultured cells. The ability to study SARS-CoV-2 antigenic drift under selective immune pressure by mNAbs is important for the optimal implementation of mNAbs for the therapeutic management of COVID-19. This will help to identify essential amino acid residues in the viral S glycoprotein required for mNAb-mediated inhibition of viral infection, to predict potential natural drift variants that could emerge upon implementation of therapeutic mNAbs, as well as vaccine prophylactic treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, it will also enable the assessment of MARM viral fitness and its potential to induce severe infection and associated COVID-19 disease.","Oladunni, Fatai S; Park, Jun-Gyu; Chiem, Kevin; Ye, Chengjin; Pipenbrink, Michael; Walter, Mark R; Kobie, James; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis",J Virol Methods,155,26

Electron diffraction revealed the emergence of medium-range ordering of Cu atoms in the high-temperature f.c.c. phase. By referring to the Coulomb interaction evaluations, the superstructures for the medium-range ordering were constructed. Such medium-range atomic ordering was sustained over a wide temperature range (from the phase transition temperature to over 800â K in the TEM) but gradually changed to short-range ordering as indicated by the appearance of diffuse scattering rings.","Lu, Ping; Qiu, Wujie; Wei, Yuyu; Zhu, Chenxi; Shi, Xun; Chen, Lidong; Xu, Fangfang",Acta Crystallogr B Struct Sci Cryst Eng Mater,155,1

Ultraviolet radiation, in addition to its role in the synthesis of vitamin D, stimulates anti-inflammatory pathways, alters the composition of dendritic cells, T cells, and T regulatory cells, and induces nitric oxide synthase and heme oxygenase metabolic pathways, which may directly or indirectly mitigate disease progression and susceptibility. Recent work has also explored how the immune-modulating functions of ultraviolet radiation affect type II diabetes, cancer, and the current global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. These diseases are particularly important amidst global changes in lifestyle that result in unhealthy eating, increased sedentary habits, and alcohol and tobacco consumption. Compelling epidemiological data shows increased ultraviolet radiation associated with reduced rates of certain cancers, such as colorectal cancer, breast cancer, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and ultraviolet radiation exposure correlated with susceptibility and mortality rates of COVID-19.

Because of differences in their role within the health system, each group's calculation of telehealth's value may align or not with one another, depending on how it is being used. Therefore, a common mental model for determining value is critical in order to use telehealth in ways that produce win-win situations for most if not all four stakeholder groups.

Dutcher films are ultrathin trilayer films consisting of a fluid layer sandwiched in between two solid layers. The van der Waals forces acting across the film can result in the spontaneous formation of surface undulations and corrugations. The complex interplay between the van der Waals forces, the elastic deformation of the solid layers and the fluid dynamics of the sandwiched fluid essentially selects a wavelength of undulation which grows most rapidly. We show how the lateral deformations in the solid layers can be obtained from the elastic stretching free energy as a function of the height variations. Furthermore, these lateral deformations can be shown to contribute to a pressure normal to the film which influences the dynamics of fluctuation growth. By taking into consideration the large-amplitude elastic stretching effects we simulate the late stages of undulation growth including the contact between the upper and lower solid layers. As the area of contact between the solid layers increases the fluid is corralled into isolated pockets. Because our numerical model captures the full elasticity of the solid layers we show how internal forces can be incorporated into the system. As a demonstration, we simulate the effects of thermal mismatch between a small region of the film and the surrounding matrix and show how concentric grooves can be formed in Dutcher films.","Buxton, Gavin A; Clarke, Nigel",Soft Matter,155,23

Utmost concern is the possibility of aerosol mediated infection transfer, which is largely governed by the size distributions of virus laden droplets, termed as virusols in this work, ejected from humans. We expand on the well-known theory of Poisson fluctuations which acts as statistical barrier against formation of virusols. Analysis suggests that for viral loads < 2 × 105 RNA copies/mL, often corresponding to mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19, droplets of diameter < 20 µm at the time of emission (equivalent to ~ 10 µm desiccated residue diameter) are unlikely to be of consequence in carrying infections. Cut-off diameters below which droplets will be practically free of contamination, are presented as a function of viral loading. The median diameters of virus laden polydisperse droplet distributions will be 1.5 to 20 times higher depending upon the geometric standard deviation. The studies have implications to risk assessment as well as residence time estimates of airborne infections in indoor environments. Additionally, it will be also helpful for performance evaluation of sanitization and control technologies to mitigate infection risks in workplaces.","Anand, S; Mayya, Y S",Sci Rep,155,24

It has many symptoms, such as: fever, sore throat, headache, dyspnoea, and diarrhoea. Arbidol was used in the treatment of COVID19, which was the most critical health problem in the world. However, the desired recovery was not achieved with Arbidol. Many countries still use this drug in the treatment of COVID19. AIM: We aimed to determine whether Arbidol, the hemagglutinin esterase inhibitor used in the treatment of COVID-19, was effective against SARS Cov-2 in silico. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The similarity between hemagglutinin and spike proteins were reported due to the fact that inhibition properties of Arbidol and its 39 analogues were examined in detail against hemagglutinin esterase and spike glycoproteins. CID 1070884 and CID 1207786 were found to be more active against hemagglutinin esterase than in Arbidol, while these compounds were inactive against spike glycoproteins. The interaction mechanism was clarified between arbidol and spike proteins. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, glycine, lysine, and aspartic acid were found to be the headliner amino acids in the interactions between Arbidol and binding domains of spike glycoproteins in the SARS-CoV2 (Tab. 3, Fig. 8, Ref. 28).","Aktas, A; Tuzun, B; Taskin, A H; Sayin, K; Ataseven, H",Bratisl Lek Listy,155,16

Whilst the immediate focus has been on the contribution of the medical and life sciences, civically minded universities have also drawn on the social sciences to help public authorities address the challenges of economic and social recovery in a more sustainable and inclusive way. This has required them to put citizens at the heart of placed based societal innovation. Going forward universities and their funders must learn from the good they have done during the health crises and then seek to build a new normal based on values rather than on quasi-artificial performance metrics. A values approach would embed a university more strongly within local government structures where it could then benefit from political influence and financial systems.

Therefore, the objective of this review was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of IgG and IgM based point-of-care (POC) lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (CLIA), fluorescence enzyme-linked immunoassay (FIA) and ELISA systems that detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens. METHOD: A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed, Medline complete and MedRxiv. Studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 were eligible. Study selection and data-extraction were performed by two authors independently. QUADAS-2 checklist tool was used to assess the quality of the studies. The bivariate model and the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve model were performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the serological tests. Subgroup meta-analysis was performed to explore the heterogeneity. RESULTS: The pooled sensitivity for IgG (n = 17), IgM (n = 16) and IgG-IgM (n = 24) based LFIA tests were 0.5856, 0.4637 and 0.6886, respectively compared to rRT-PCR method. The pooled sensitivity for IgG (n = 9) and IgM (n = 10) based CLIA tests were 0.9311 and 0.8516, respectively compared to rRT-PCR. The pooled sensitivity the IgG (n = 10), IgM (n = 11) and IgG-IgM (n = 5) based ELISA tests were 0.8292, 0.8388 and 0.8531 respectively compared to rRT-PCR. All tests displayed high specificities ranging from 0.9693 to 0.9991. Amongst the evaluated tests, IgG based CLIA expressed the highest sensitivity signifying its accurate detection of the largest proportion of infections identified by rRT-PCR. ELISA and CLIA tests performed better in terms of sensitivity compared to LFIA. IgG based tests performed better compared to IgM except for the ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: We report that IgG-IgM based ELISA tests have the best overall diagnostic test accuracy. Moreover, irrespective of the method, a combined IgG/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody type independently. Given the poor performances of the current LFIA devices, there is a need for more research on the development of highly sensitivity and specific POC LFIA that are adequate for most individual patient applications and attractive for large sero-prevalence studies.

Corrected QT interval should be calculated before using these drugs and if it is, already prolonged treatment options should be discussed. In addition, atrio-ventricular blocks may occur during the treatment, interfering with calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers, if they are already being administered. Lopinavir and ritonavir are also associated with prolonged PR and QT interval that may evolve in higher-grade atrioventricular blocks. It is mandatory to assess whether arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients are preventable, treatable or permanent, or if they have long-term effects on the patient’s cardiovascular status. Arrhythmias and cardiac arrest are more likely to be triggered by a severe, systemic form of COVID-19 and are not the sole consequence of the viral infection. In addition, electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia, micro thrombi formation, cytokine storm, direct invasion of cardiomyocytes and hypoxemia may induce severe forms of arrhythmias in these patients. Telemedicine is used to diagnose arrhythmias and permits left ventricular dysfunction assessment. It can evaluate the efficacy of antiarrhythmic therapy or the proarrhythmic side effects of patient’s medication. An important application is pacemaker interrogation or automatic intracardiac defibrillator function assessment. Telemedicine is a more permissive way to diagnose arrhythmias in these patients. However, automated interpretations are not sufficiently accurate without expert review, especially in the presence of rhythm disturbances or complex abnormalities. It is limiting the time of exposure between the doctor and the patient and offers a complete overview of the disease. It is also a competitive method for triage and has screening potential. Telemedicine can be considered to play a major part in COVID-19 patients’ management, because it provides a quick and precise diagnosis that is obtained without unnecessary exposure of the medical personnel. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Floria, M.; Ceomîrtan-Negrii, I.

So far, there is not any prescribed line of treatment for COVID-19 patients. Measures to control the disease are very limited, partly due to the lack of knowledge about technologies which could be effectively used for early detection and control the disease. Early detection of positive cases is critical in preventing further spread, achieving the herd immunity, and saving lives. Unfortunately, so far we do not have effective toolkits to diagnose very early detection of the disease. Recent research findings have suggested that radiology images, such as X-rays, contain significant information to detect the presence of COVID-19 virus in early stages. However, to detect the presence of the disease in in very early stages from the X-ray images by the naked eye is not possible. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, machine learning in particular, are known to be very helpful in accurately diagnosing many diseases from radiology images. This paper proposes an automatic technique to classifyCOVID-19 patients from their computerized tomography (CT) scan images. The technique is known as Advanced Inception based Recurrent Residual Convolution Neural Network (AIRRCNN), which uses machine learning techniques for classifying data. We focus on the Advanced Inception based Recurrent Residual Convolution Neural Network, because we do not find it being used in the literature. Also, we conduct principal component analysis, which is used for dimensional deduction.

Due to concerns for potential adverse pharmacologic effects, balancing appropriate pain management is a challenge among NH residents. The challenges encompass but are not limited to medical complexities, functional disabilities, and physical frailty. Barriers to the successful implementation of a comprehensive chronic pain management at the NH may include ambiguous directions on specific therapeutic interventions, insufficient guidance on treatment duration, and limited available treatment options. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' reporting requirement of adequate pain control among NH residents coupled with widely variable clinician-prescribing habits highlights the difficulties in overcoming the preceding challenges and barriers. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has further complicated pain management due to its negative consequences on well-being of residents of NHs. Associated symptoms of psychosocial stress, anxiety and depression, and chronic pain symptoms can exacerbate during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to increased requirement for pain medications including but not limited to opioids. Pain is a multidimensional symptom and requires a strategic multimodal approach for its management. Nonpharmacologic modalities are underutilized in the NH setting and are the preferred first steps for mild pain, and nonopioid pharmacological agents can be added as a second step for a synergistic effect for moderate to severe pain. Opioids should be used as a last resort. Short-acting opioids are preferred over extended-release/long-acting opioids for chronic pain. Clinicians are encouraged to engage residents in proactive strategies in managing their pain, and to set realistic expectations toward improving their quality of life, as complete elimination of pain is not feasible in most cases.

We investigated how IAV may increase the risk for COVID-19 lung disease, focusing on the receptor Angiotensin Convertase Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the protease TMPRSS2, which cooperate to uptake SARS-CoV-2 intracellular. We found, using single cell RNA sequencing of distal human non-diseased lung homogenates, that at baseline, ACE2 is minimally expressed in basal, goblet, ciliated, and secretory epithelial cells populating small airways. We focused on human small airway epithelial cells (SAEC), central to the pathogenesis of lung injury following viral infections. Primary SAEC from non-diseased donor lungs apically infected (at air-liquid interface) with IAV (up to 3×105â pfu; â¼1 MOI) markedly (8-fold) boosted the expression of ACE2, paralleling that of STAT1, a transcription factor activated by viruses. IAV increased the apparent electrophoretic mobility of intrac¬ellular ACE2 and generated an ACE2 fragment (90â kDa) in apical secretions, suggesting cleavage of this receptor. IAV also increased the expression of two proteases known to cleave ACE2, sheddase ADAM17 (TACE) and TMPRSS2 and increased the TMPRSS2 zymogen and its mature fragments, implicating proteolytic autoactivation. These results indicate that IAV amplifies the expression of molecules necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection of the distal lung. Further, posttranslational changes in ACE2 by IAV may increase the vulnerability to lung injury such as ARDS during viral co-infections.

Here, we performed a systematic review of the current (pre)published SARS-CoV-2 literature with a focus on the evidence concerning SARS-CoV-2 distribution in human tissues and viral shedding in body fluids. In addition, this evidence is aligned with published ACE2 entry-receptor (single cell) expression data across the human body to construct a viral distribution and ACE2 receptor body map. We highlight the broad organotropism of SARS-CoV-2, as many studies identified viral components (RNA, proteins) in multiple organs, including the pharynx, trachea, lungs, blood, heart, vessels, intestines, brain, male genitals and kidneys. This also implicates the presence of viral components in various body fluids such as mucus, saliva, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, semen and breast milk. The main SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, ACE2, is expressed at different levels in multiple tissues throughout the human body, but its expression levels do not always correspond with SARS-CoV-2 detection, indicating that there is a complex interplay between virus and host.

RESULTS: We found that pool size of five samples achieved the highest sensitivity compared to pool sizes of 10 and 15, showing a mean (± SD) Ct shift of 3.5 ± 2.2 between the pooled test and positive samples in the pool. We then used a pool size of five to test a total of 895 pools (4,475 prospective samples) using two different RT-qPCR kits available at that time. The Real Accurate Quadruplex corona-plus PCR Kit (PathoFinder) reported the lowest mean Ct (± SD) shift (2.2 ± 2.4) among the pool and the individual samples. The strategy allows detecting individual samples in the positive pools with Cts in the range of 16.7-39.4. CONCLUSIONS: We found that pools of five samples combined with RT-qPCR solutions helped to increase SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity with minimal loss of sensitivity compared to that resulting from testing the samples independently.","Alcoba-Florez, Julia; Gil-Campesino, Helena; García-Martínez de Artola, Diego; Díez-Gil, Oscar; Valenzuela-Fernández, Agustín; González-Montelongo, Rafaela; Ciuffreda, Laura; Flores, Carlos",Int. j. infect. dis,155,1

However, whether patients develop dyslipidemia is unknown. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to investigate the pathological alterations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and total cholesterol (TC) in COVID-19 patients and their relationships with the disease severity. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed to examine serum levels of LDL-c, HDL-c, and TC on 597 COVID-19 patients (mild: 394; severe, 171; critical: 32) who were hospitalized in our center between February 1 and March 3, 2020. Age- and gender-matched normal subjects (n = 50) who had routine laboratory lipid tests between October 1 and November 1, 2019 in our center were included as the control group. RESULTS: LDL-c and TC levels were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients as compared with normal subjects (P < .001). There were significant and gradual decreases in levels of LDL-c (median (IQR) in mg/dL, mild: 91 (76, 104); severe: 86 (69, 102); critical: 69 (48, 81); P < .02) and TC (mild: 173 (148, 203); severe: 167 (138, 197); critical: 125 (95, 162); P < .05) across all three groups. HDL-c levels only decreased significantly in critical cases as compared with levels in mild and severe cases. LDL-c and TC levels inversely correlated with C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, and positively correlated with the number of lymphocytes in patients. CONCLUSIONS: Development of hypolipidemia begins in patients with mild symptoms. It progressively becomes worse in an association with the disease severity.","Wei, Xiuqi; Zeng, Wenjuan; Su, Jingyu; Wan, Huimin; Yu, Xinqin; Cao, Xiaoling; Tan, Wenbin; Wang, Hui",J Clin Lipidol,155,16

More recently, these higher rates have been attributed to underlying social, structural, and environmental determinants of health including resource inequities, inadequate housing, and occupational and environmental hazards that result in greater exposure to and less protection from COVID-19. 5,6 Augmented by the added physiologic stress of pregnancy, these comorbidities and disparities compound the risk of pregnancy-associated cardiomyopathy, thromboembolism, and hemorrhage, often resulting in lasting physical and mental health consequences.","Stratton, Pamela; Gorodetsky, Elena; Clayton, Janine",J. natl. med. assoc,155,22

Mexico's population is younger, yet COVID-19's impact on older adults is comparable to countries with older population structures. Here, we aim to identify health and structural determinants that increase susceptibility to COVID-19 in older Mexican adults beyond chronological aging. METHODS: We analyzed confirmed COVID-19 cases in older adults using data from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of Mexican Ministry of Health. We modeled risk factors for increased COVID-19 severity and mortality, using mixed models to incorporate multilevel data concerning healthcare access and marginalization. We also evaluated structural factors and comorbidity profiles compared to chronological age for COVID-19 mortality risk prediction. RESULTS: We analyzed 20,804 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in adults aged &#8805;60 years. Male sex, smoking, diabetes, and obesity were associated with pneumonia, hospitalization and ICU admission in older adults, CKD and COPD were associated with hospitalization. High social lag indexes and access to private care were predictors of COVID-19 severity and mortality. Age was not a predictor of COVID-19 severity in individuals without comorbidities and combination of structural factors and comorbidities were better predictors of COVID-19 lethality and severity compared to chronological age alone. COVID-19 baseline lethality hazards were heterogeneously distributed across Mexican municipalities, particularly when comparing urban and rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: Structural factors and comorbidity explain excess risk for COVID-19 severity and mortality over chronological age in older Mexican adults.

We intended to assess whether lung ultrasound (LUS) examinations performed by PC physicians are a useful tool to detect lung injury and may help in decisions about hospital referral. METHODS: This study included 61 patients with moderate symptoms suggesting COVID-19 who were evaluated with LUS by PC physicians and then referred to a hospital during the current pandemic peak in Madrid. We analyzed association of a simple self-designed LUS severity scale (grade 0, normal; grade 1, multiple separated B-lines, pleural irregularity, or both; and grade 2, coalescent B-lines, consolidations, pleural effusion, or a combination thereof) with the main outcome indicating adequacy of hospital referral, and also with chest x-ray (CXR) findings. RESULTS: The proposed LUS severity scale was significantly associated with the main outcome of appropriate referral (P = 0.001): the higher the scale, the higher the percentage of adequate referrals. The LUS scale was also associated with a CXR severity scale (P = 0.034). The presence of coalescent B-lines was the only independent LUS finding significantly associated with the appropriate-referral outcome (P =0 .008) and also with a higher probability of hospital admission (P = 0.02) and with several CXR findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the use of LUS in PC as a tool to assess patients with suspected COVID-19. Its use can reduce uncertainty during clinical evaluations of moderate patients, facilitate early detection of lung involvement, allow early appropriate referral, and avoid unnecessary referral.","Calvo-Cebrián, Antonio; Alonso-Roca, Rafael; Rodriguez-Contreras, Francisco Javier; Rodríguez-Pascual, Maria de Las Nieves; Calderín-Morales, Maria Del Pino",J. ultrasound med,155,1

However, postoperative chronic pain is frequently reported and may lead to opioid use and dependence. Due to the increasing concern of the overuse of opioids in medical treatments, a search for other viable options is recognized. As a consequence, alternative therapies, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), pulsed radiofrequency (PRF), and spinal cord stimulation (SCS) are being tried to potentially replace traditional opioid use in treating persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP), thus reducing opioid dependence across the nation.

Therefore, it is important for universities to quantify student-learning effectiveness based on MOOC. However, its operation faces many challenges to educational administrators and teachers. The most important thing is that the completion rate of learners is usually low, and therefore it is not comprehensive and objective to directly use online data to assess and predict the student-learning effectiveness. In order to assess multi-stage learning effectiveness of students in MOOC comprehensively, we proposed MOLEAS, a multi-stage online learning effectiveness assessment scheme. First, MOLEAS uses matrix completion to predict missing learning data of students. We take two open courses offered in the icourse MOOC platform as examples to analyze online data, and then we study the student-learning effectiveness using the matrix completion. The prediction results prove the effectiveness and reliability of our model. Then, combined with the prediction, MOLEAS utilizes the influencing factors of student-learning effectiveness, and a series of measures to improve the entire learning effectiveness of students in MOOC.

To overcome this challenge, we redesigned our pre-COVID face-to-face physiology labs with the objective of preserving most of their learning outcomes. Towards this end, we applied the concept of treating labs as integrated instructional units (America's Lab Report, https://www.nap.edu/read/11311/chapter/5). Our approach was to replace student hands-on lab protocol focus with an integrative lab approach that allows the students to not only record data from real-time, video-recorded experiments, but also to map them out on the corresponding anatomical architecture and mechanisms under investigation. The video recordings were performed by the instructor synchronously during the class session then posted for the students online as part of an expanded lab package that includes instrumentation and protocol details, experimental parameters and variables, relevant anatomical and physiological mechanistic footnotes, as well as expected lab report format and rubric. Using this approach, physiology labs originally designed separately to investigate principles and mechanisms of diffusion, neuronal reflexes, EMG, ECG, and hemodynamics were replaced with integrated labs designed to allow side-by-side comparisons and provide stimulating visual demonstrations of empirical work and relevant mechanistic and anatomical architecture. Two such lab examples are: (1) comparing speedsof: (a) food dye diffusion in solution based on real-time measurements in a glass plate aligned with measuring scales, (b) action potential conduction based on mapped-out neuronal pathway lengths and online measurement of relevant reaction time (https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/java/redgreen.html), and (c) blood flow between the cardiac left ventricle and the site of pulse measurement in the finger based on vasculature anatomy and the time delay between the ECG's QRS electrical wave peak and onset of finger mechanical pulse wave, and (2) comparing time, amplitude, distribution, and discreteness of grip strength-forearm EMG recording with that of the QRS and P-wave of the ECG with emphasis on skeletal versus cardiac muscle electrophysiological mechanisms of action potential initiation and propagation as well as corresponding muscle mass as well as physiological mechanisms. Having successfully applied this new lab design in Fall 2020, more data is expected in Spring 2021 to be presented at the APS annual meeting in late April 2021.","Al-Ghoul, Walid Siddiqui Meraj Jisrawi Najeh",The FASEB Journal,155,15

It argues that in situations of uncertainty argumentation affects action via appeals that invoke emotion and thereby translate the distant past and future into the situated present. Using practical inferences, a threefold model for the interrelation of emotion and time in argumentation outlines how argumentative action depends on whether speakers provide reasons for the exigence that makes a decision necessary, the contingency of the decision, and the confidence required to act. Experiences and choices from the past influence the emotions experienced in the present and inform two intertemporal mechanisms that allow speakers and audiences to take the leap of faith that defines decision-making under uncertainty: retrospective forecasting and prospective remembering. Retrospective forecasting establishes a past-future-present link, whereas prospective remembering establishes a future-past-present link, and, together, the two mechanisms provide a situated presence that transcends the temporal constraints of uncertainty. Finally, the applicability of the model is illustrated through an analysis of a speech delivered by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, a time where the need for decisive, yet argumentative action was crucial.","Lantz, Prins Marcus Valiant",Argumentation,155,32

In this study, we aimed to evaluate serum antibody responses in patients regardless of the outcome. We measured the circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels in 60 subjects with a certified history of SARS-CoV-2 infection by using immunoenzymatic, chemiluminescent, and Neutralization assays. Half patients had a severe infection, the other half were pauci-symptomatic. We analyzed their antibody response to see the trend of the humoral response. Our results showed a significant difference in circulating IgG level among the two groups. The neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 was significantly higher among those who had severe disease. Furthermore, ten subjects from each group were screened twice, and a declining antibody trend was observed in pauci-symptomatic individuals. These findings provide evidence that humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in pauci-symptomatic people is weak and may not be long-lasting. This may have implications for immunity strategy and prevention, since it is still not clear whether a time-dependent decrease of both circulating and neutralizing antibodies to nonprotective levels could occur in a longer time span and whether potential vaccines are able to induce a herd immunity and a durable response.","Anichini, Gabriele; Gandolfo, Claudia; Terrosi, Chiara; Fabrizi, Simonetta; Miceli, Giovanni Battista; Gori Savellini, Gianni; Prathyumnan, Shibily; Franchi, Federico; Cusi, Maria Grazia",J Med Virol,155,5

Artificial intelligence-based diagnostic decision support system have been developed to enhance clinical performance by suggesting differential diagnoses to a given case, based on an integrated medical knowledge base and machine learning techniques. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Ada, an app-based diagnostic tool and the impact on patient outcome. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The eRadaR trial is a prospective, double-blinded study with patients presenting to the emergency room (ER) with abdominal pain. At initial contact in the ER, a structured interview will be performed using the Ada-App and both, patients and attending physicians, will be blinded to the proposed diagnosis lists until trial completion. Throughout the study, clinical data relating to diagnostic findings and types of therapy will be obtained and the follow-up until day 90 will comprise occurrence of complications and overall survival of patients. The primary efficacy of the trial is defined by the percentage of correct diagnoses suggested by Ada compared with the final discharge diagnosis. Further, accuracy and timing of diagnosis will be compared with decision making of classical doctor-patient interaction. Secondary objectives are complications, length of hospital stay and overall survival.

METHODS: Data of patients operated between March 10 and May 20, 2020, were collected retrospectively. Data were statistically analyzed using IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Statistics for Windows v. SP21.0. RESULTS: Data of 200 patients were included. Their mean age was 56 years. Of the patients, 54% (n=108), 27.5% (n=55), 12.5% (n=25), and 2% (n=4) were diagnosed as having endometrial, ovarian, cervical, and vulvar cancer, respectively. Of them, 98% underwent non-emergent surgery. A minimally invasive surgical approach was used in 18%. Stage 1 cancer was found in 68% of patients. Surgeons reported COVID-related changes in 10% of the cases. The rate of postoperative complications was 12%. Only two patients had cough and suspected pneumonic lesions on thoracic computed tomography postoperatively, but neither was positive for COVID-19 on polymerase chain reaction testing. CONCLUSION: Based on the present findings, it is thought that gynecologic cancer surgery should continue during the COVID-19 pandemic while adhering to the measures.

We sought to ascertain the impact of rapid isothernal nucleic acid based testing for COVID-19 in an unselected cohort of pregnant women attending our maternity unit. We also assessed the correlation between community prevalence and asymptomatic carriage. METHODS: Data for the retrospective cohort study were collected from a large UK tertiary maternity unit over a 4-week period using computerised hospital records. Literature searches were performed across multiple repositories. COVID-19 prevalence was extracted from online repositories. RESULTS: Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from 457/465 (98%) women during the study period. The median turnaround time for results was 5.3 h (interquartile range (IQR) 2.6-8.9 h), with 92% of the results returned within 24 h. In our cohort, only one woman tested positive, giving a screen positive rate of 0.22% (1/457; 95% CI: 0.04-1.23%). One woman who tested negative developed a fever postnatally following discharge but was lost to follow-up. From our literature review, we did not find any correlation between asymptomatic carriage in pregnant women and the reported regional prevalence of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Testing using the SAMBA-II machine was acceptable to the vast majority of pregnant women requiring admission and had a low turnaround time. Asymptomatic carriage is low, but not correlated to community prevalence rates. Screening pregnant women on admission will remain an important component in order to minimise nosocomial infection.","Xu, Ruiling; Pauley, Tara Alicia; Missfelder-Lobos, Hannah; Haddon, Richard John; Gupta, Ravindra Kumar; Chong, Hsu Phern",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,155,16

Therefore, recommendations for the allocation of intensive care resources in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have been developed by a multidisciplinary authors group with support of eight scientific medical societies. The recommendations for procedures and criteria for prioritisations in case of resource scarcity are based on scientific evidence, ethico-legal considerations and practical experience. Medical decisions must always be based on the need and the treatment preferences of the individual patient. In addition to this patient-centred approach, prioritisations in case of resource scarcity require a supra-individual perspective. In such situations, prioritisations should be based on the criterion of clinical prospect of success in order to minimize the number of preventable deaths due to resource scarcity and to avoid discrimination based on age, disabilities or social factors. Assessment of the clinical prospect of success should take into account the severity of the current illness, severe comorbidities and the patient's general health status prior to the current illness.","Marckmann, Georg; Neitzke, Gerald; Schildmann, Jan; Michalsen, Andrej; Dutzmann, Jochen; Hartog, Christiane; Jöbges, Susanne; Knochel, Kathrin; Michels, Guido; Pin, Martin; Riessen, Reimer; Rogge, Annette; Taupitz, Jochen; Janssens, Uwe",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,155,15

Several evidence support the crucial role of adhesion molecules in the development of atherosclerosis and plaque instability. Due to the anti-inflammatory activity of Tribulus terrestris (TT), the present study investigated the effect of aqueous extract and saponin fraction of TT on the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and SELE genes in endothelial cells during normal and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced conditions. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human bone marrow endothelial cells (HBMEC) were cultured, stimulated by LPS, and treated with aqueous extract and saponin fraction of TT. Finally, the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and SELE genes were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. LPS-induced HUVECs and HBMECs significantly increased the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and SELE in comparison with control groups (P<0.001). Treatment of LPS-induced HUVECs and HBMECs by aqueous extract and saponin fraction of TT decreased the expression of all three mentioned genes significantly (P<0.001) in comparison with LPS-induced cells.

There have been a few cases in the literature that demonstrate the association between COVID-19 and hypertriglyceridemia in the setting of treatment with tocilizumab. We report, to our knowledge, the first known series of patients with critical illness resulting from COVID-19, who developed severe hypertriglyceridemia in the absence of treatment with tocilizumab. Description: Case 1: A 57-year-old male with end-stage renal disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension was admitted to the hospital with worsening shortness of breath due to COVID-19. He was initially managed with conservative measures including supplemental oxygen on the medical floor but required transfer to the ICU for worsening hypoxemia necessitating invasive mechanical ventilation. The patient developed a lipemic serum on hospital day 8. His triglyceride level was noted to be 3160mg/dl, with a baseline level of 224mg/dl 1-year prior. Patient deteriorated rapidly and expired before appropriate treatment measures for his hypertriglyceridemia could be implemented. Case 2: A 73-year-old male with pulmonary fibrosis and coronary artery disease was admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath due to COVID-19. He was managed with remdesivir and dexamethasone on the medical floor, but deteriorated further and required invasive mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy. Patient developed lipemic serum on hospital day 19 and was found to have a triglyceride level of 1757mg/dl, with a baseline level of 173mg/dl 1-year prior. Patient was started on an insulin infusion but continued to deteriorate and expired on hospital day 20. Case 3: A 47-year-old hypertensive male patient was admitted with worsening shortness of breath due to COVID-19. He was initially treated with dexamethasone and supplemental oxygen but deteriorated and required invasive mechanical ventilation as well as continuous renal replacement therapy. He was noted to have a lipemic serum on hospital day 14 and was found to have a triglyceride level of 945mg/dl. Patient was managed with an insulin infusion with subsequent improvement in his levels. Patient had a prolonged hospitalization and required tracheostomy but has since made a full recovery including the recovery of his renal function, and has returned to work. Image below shows the lipemic serum of our patient: Discussion: These cases suggest an association between severe COVID-19 and hypertriglyceridemia in the absence of treatment with tocilizumab. Further studies are needed to determine whether this association truly exists, its implications on prognosis, and to determine optimal management strategies.","Tariq, F.; Pau, D.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,155,21

Although more experimental and clinical evidence is required, the accumulated in vitro and clinical knowledge discussed here supports those drugs as feasible alternatives to face the SARS-CoV infection in the short term, whereas more effective measures arise from the world scientific community.","Gomez-Rios, D.; Lopez-Agudelo, V.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of the COVID-19 epidemic on physical activity and perceived physical fitness in Japanese adults aged 40 to 69 years. Data were collected from an online survey conducted between October 19 and 28, 2020. The analytic sample consisted of 1989 Japanese adults (mean age, 50.1 ± 6.9 years; women, 38.9%) who were aged between 40 and 69 years and completed the online survey. Overall, the PA time per week decreased by 32.4% between October 2019 and April 2020. A decrease in PA time was recorded in October 2020; however, a decline of 15.5% was observed. Compared to individuals who did not perceive a decline in physical fitness, individuals who perceived declining physical fitness during the COVID-19 state of emergency demonstrated a greater decrease in PA time in April 2020 (-50.5%), and this trend continued into October 2020 (-25.0%). These findings may indicate that Japanese adults aged 40 to 69 years who perceived declining physical fitness experienced a greater decrease in physical activity.","Makizako, Hyuma; Akaida, Shoma; Shono, Saki; Shiiba, Ryuhei; Taniguchi, Yoshiaki; Shiratsuchi, Daijo; Nakai, Yuki",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),155,16

We reported the case of a 6-year-old child presented with acute abdomen and then diagnosed with MIS-C. In addition, to better portray this new entity, we performed a systematic review of MIS-C gastrointestinal features and particularly on those mimicking surgical emergencies. Methods: We described the clinical presentation, the diagnostic approach and the therapeutic outcomes of our MIS-C patient. Parallel to this, we conducted a systematic literature search using Google Scholar, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, focusing on gastrointestinal MIS-C. Results: Our patient was initially assessed by the surgical team due to his query acute abdomen. Following the diagnosis of MIS-C with myocarditis, intravenous methylprednisolone (2 mg/Kg/day) and intravenous immunoglobulins (2 gr/Kg single infusion) were promptly started, leading to clinical improvement. According to our literature search, patients with MIS-C have a high rate of severe abdominal symptoms resembling surgical emergencies (appendicitis, obstruction, etc.) and a not negligible number of those patients have been surgically explored with variable findings. Conclusions: We encourage pediatric surgeons in the upcoming months of COVID-19 pandemic to evaluate myocardial function prior to surgical abdominal exploration. In children with query acute abdomen, MIS-C should be promptly ruled out in order to avoid unnecessary surgeries that could worsen the already frail outcome of this new syndrome. Nevertheless, it should be considered that MIS-C might well encompass complications (e.g. appendicitis, segmental intestinal ischemia) which need swift surgical treatment.","Valitutti, Francesco; Verde, Alessandra; Pepe, Angela; Sorrentino, Eduardo; Veneruso, Deborah; Ranucci, Giusy; Orlando, Francesca; Mastrominico, Augusto; Grella, Mia Giovanna; Mandato, Claudia",J Pediatr Surg Case Rep,155,26

OBJECTIVE: Evaluate and compare clinical characteristics, immune and acute phase response, viral shedding and viral load in pigs singly and doubly inoculated with swine influenza A virus (swIAV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). ANIMALS: Fifty-four 7-week-old piglets. METHODS: Clinical status and gross lung lesions were scored. Titration of swIAV was carried out in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. The PRRSV RNA was quantified using a commercial qPCR kit. Antibodies were detected by hemagglutination inhibition assay and commercial ELISA. A lymphocyte proliferation assay was used to measure antigen-specific T-cell responses. Acute phase proteins were determined using ELISA. RESULTS: No differences were found between mean clinical scores, swIAV and PRRSV shedding, and magnitude of the humoral and T-cell response between single-inoculated and dual-inoculated groups. Concentrations of C-reactive protein and haptoglobin increased in PRRSV-inoculated and coinoculated groups, whereas serum amyloid A concentration was increased in groups inoculated or coinoculated with swIAV. Mean swIAV TCID50 titers in the lungs did not differ significantly between coinoculated and swIAV single-inoculated pigs. A significantly higher mean copy number of PRRSV was found in the lungs of PRRSV only-inoculated pigs at 2 day postinoculation (DPI). From 4 DPI, no significant differences in PRRSV load were identified. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Coinfection of pigs with swIAV and PRRSV did not potentiate clinical signs, lung lesions, immune response, and replication of the viruses in the respiratory tract.","Pomorska-Mól, Malgorzata; Podgórska, Katarzyna; Czyzewska-Dors, Ewelina; Turlewicz-Podbielska, Hanna; Gogulski, Maciej; Wlodarek, Jan; Lukomska, Anna",J. vet. intern. med,155,1

Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 related (COVID-19) pandemic, enteroviruses were the most common cause of classic myocarditis. However, since 2020, myocarditis linked to multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is now common. In recent months, myocarditis related to COVID-19 vaccines has also been described. This study aims to compare these three different types of myocarditis with regards to clinical presentation, course, and outcomes. MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, we included all patients <21 years of age hospitalized at our institution with classic viral myocarditis from 2015-2019, MIS-C myocarditis from 3/2020-2/2021 and COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis from 5/2021-6/2021. We compared demographics, initial symptomatology, treatment, laboratory data, and echocardiogram findings. ResultsOf 201 total participants, 43 patients had classic myocarditis, 149 had MIS-C myocarditis, and 9 had COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis. Peak troponin was highest in the classic myocarditis group, whereas the MIS-C myocarditis group had the highest recorded brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). There were significant differences in time to recovery of normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) for the three groups: nearly all patients with MIS-C myocarditis (n=139, 93%) and all patients with COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis (n=9, 100%) had normal LVEF at the time of discharge, but a lower proportion of the classic myocarditis group (n=30, 70%) had a normal LVEF at discharge (p<0.001). Three months post-discharge, 18 of 40 children (45%) in the classic myocarditis group still required heart failure treatment, whereas only one of the MIS-C myocarditis patients and none of the COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis patients did. ConclusionsCompared to those with classic myocarditis, those with MIS-C myocarditis had more significant hematologic derangements and worse inflammation at presentation, but had better clinical outcomes, including rapid recovery of cardiac function. Patients with COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis had similar clinical presentation to patients with classic myocarditis, but their pattern of recovery was similar to those with MIS-C, with prompt resolution of symptoms and improvement of cardiac function. Long-term follow-up should focus on cardiac and non-cardiac consequences of myocarditis associated with COVID-19 illness and vaccination.","Patel, Trisha; Kelleman, Michael; West, Zachary; Peter, Andrew; Dove, Matthew; Butto, Arene; Oster, Matthew",,155,32

However, clinical laboratory metrics suggest key differences in these pathologies. We sought to determine whether plasma coagulation and fibrinolytic potential in patients with COVID-19 differ compared with healthy donors and critically ill patients with sepsis. Approach and Results: We performed comparative studies on plasmas from a single-center, cross-sectional observational study of 99 hospitalized patients (46 with COVID-19 and 53 with sepsis) and 18 healthy donors. We measured biomarkers of endogenous coagulation and fibrinolytic activity by immunoassays, thrombin, and plasmin generation potential by fluorescence and fibrin formation and lysis by turbidity. Compared with healthy donors, patients with COVID-19 or sepsis both had elevated fibrinogen, d-dimer, soluble TM (thrombomodulin), and plasmin-antiplasmin complexes. Patients with COVID-19 had increased thrombin generation potential despite prophylactic anticoagulation, whereas patients with sepsis did not. Plasma from patients with COVID-19 also had increased endogenous plasmin potential, whereas patients with sepsis showed delayed plasmin generation. The collective perturbations in plasma thrombin and plasmin generation permitted enhanced fibrin formation in both COVID-19 and sepsis. Unexpectedly, the lag times to thrombin, plasmin, and fibrin formation were prolonged with increased disease severity in COVID-19, suggesting a loss of coagulation-initiating mechanisms accompanies severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Both COVID-19 and sepsis are associated with endogenous activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis, but these diseases differently impact plasma procoagulant and fibrinolytic potential. Dysregulation of procoagulant and fibrinolytic pathways may uniquely contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and sepsis.","Bouck, Emma G; Denorme, Frederik; Holle, Lori A; Middelton, Elizabeth A; Blair, Antoinette; de Laat, Bas; Schiffman, Joshua D; Yost, Christian Con; Rondina, Matthew T; Wolberg, Alisa S; Campbell, Robert A",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,155,21

Unfortunately, the antiviral drugs commonly used in clinical practice to treat viral infections, are not applicable to SARS-Cov-2 and no vaccine is available. Thus, it is extremely necessary to identify new drugs suitable for the treatment of the 2019-nCoV outbreak.

Therefore, it is necessary to reasonably select antivirus masks and optimize the use of them for everyone. However, the uncertainty of the effects of COVID-19 and limits of human cognition add to the difficulty for decision makers to perfectly realize the purpose. To maximize the utility of the antivirus mask, we proposed a decision support algorithm based on the novel concept of the spherical normal fuzzy (SpNoF) set. In it, firstly, we analyzed the new score and accuracy function, improved operational rules, and their properties. Then, in line with these operations, we developed the SpNoF Bonferroni mean operator and the weighted Bonferroni mean operator, some properties of which are also examined. Furthermore, we established a multi-criteria decision-making method, based on the proposed operators, with SpNoF information. Finally, a numerical example on antivirus mask selection over the COVID-19 pandemic was given to verify the practicability of the proposed method, which the sensitive and comparative analysis was based on and was conducted to demonstrate the availability and superiority of our method.","Yang, Zaoli; Li, Xin; Garg, Harish; Qi, Meng",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),155,1

This study describes the mental health and well-being of workers both with and without clinical exposure to patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to measure the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being among faculty and staff at a university and academic medical center during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and describe work-related and personal factors associated with their mental health and well-being. METHODS: All faculty, staff, and postdoctoral fellows of a university, including its medical school, were invited in April 2020 to complete an online questionnaire measuring stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being. We examined associations between these outcomes and factors including work in high-risk clinical settings and family/home stressors. RESULTS: There were 5550 respondents (overall response rate of 34.3%). Overall, 34% of faculty and 14% of staff (n=915) were providing clinical care, while 61% of faculty and 77% of staff were working from home. Among all workers, anxiety (prevalence ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.73), depression (prevalence ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.03-1.59), and high work exhaustion (prevalence ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.13-1.36) were independently associated with community or clinical exposure to COVID-19. Poor family-supportive behaviors by supervisors were also associated with these outcomes (prevalence ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.21-1.62; prevalence ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.48-1.92; and prevalence ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.44-1.64, respectively). Age <40 years and a greater number of family/home stressors were also associated with these poorer outcomes. Among the subset of clinicians, caring for patients with COVID-19 and working in high-risk clinical settings were additional risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the pandemic has had negative effects on the mental health and well-being of both clinical and nonclinical employees. Mitigating exposure to COVID-19 and increasing supervisor support are modifiable risk factors that may protect mental health and well-being for all workers.","Evanoff, Bradley A; Strickland, Jaime R; Dale, Ann Marie; Hayibor, Lisa; Page, Emily; Duncan, Jennifer G; Kannampallil, Thomas; Gray, Diana L",J Med Internet Res,155,24

The main objective of this paper is to profile adopters (and non-adopters) of Australia's COVIDSafe CTMA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We use latent profile analysis to examine predictors of CTMA download behaviour. Specifically, we draw on a representative Australian sample (N = 2575) to examine the interplay between age, education, income, dispositional desire for privacy and political ideology on download behaviour. We examine trust in government as a mediating mechanism between profiles and download behaviour. RESULTS: Our analysis produces seven profiles. Trust in government mediates the relationship between most profiles and download behaviour. A combination of wealth and education appear to be key explanatory factors of CTMA download behaviour. Two profiles -- comprising individuals with high income and education -- had the highest rates of download behaviour. Profiles with low download percentages comprised politically left-leaning participants with average to low income and education. CONCLUSION: Our findings clearly indicate the profiles of people who are (not) likely to download a CTMA. Practical ways to improve widespread adoption include providing structural support to the more vulnerable members of society, making clear the societal benefits of downloading CTMAs, and engaging in bipartisan promotion of such apps.","Lockey, Steven; Edwards, Martin R; Hornsey, Matthew J; Gillespie, Nicole; Akhlaghpour, Saeed; Colville, Shannon",Int J Med Inform,155,1

IL is classified as primary and secondary types. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 3-month-old girl born at term from vaginal delivery with an APGAR score of 10/10 and birth weight of 4.310âg (>97° percentile) was admitted to our hospital because of increasing abdominal tenderness and diarrhea. At first examination, she presented an abdominal circumference of 60âcm, edema of the lower extremities and vulva, and facial dysmorphisms (hypertelorism, flat nasal bridge, flat mid-face). DIAGNOSIS: Once admitted, ultrasonography showed a large amount of ascites, while blood laboratory investigations revealed severe hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia and hypogammaglobulinemia. Lymphoscintigraphy with 99m-Tc-nanocolloid demonstrated abnormal leakage of the tracer in the abdomen as evidence of IL. To detect a possible secondary, exams were performed and demonstrated positive antibody titres for CMV-IgM and IgG in blood and CMV-DNA positivity in blood, urine, saliva, maternal milk, and gastric and duodenal biopsies. Genetic investigations identified the genomic variant c.472C>T of the CCBE1 gene, coding for a protein variant (p.Arg158Cys), in homozygosity. INTERVENTIONS: Total parenteral nutrition was started and continued for a total of 18 days, then gradually bridged by enteral nutrition with a special formula. In addition, antiviral therapy for CMV infection was added first with intravenous ganciclovir for 14 days, resulting in the disappearance of blood viral load after 7 days of therapy and then with valganciclovir per os for another 30 days. OUTCOMES: The clinical course of the child gradually improved. A few days after starting treatments, lower extremities and vulvar edema disappeared, and abdominal circumference gradually decreased to a stable value of 38âcm, without any ultrasonographic signs of ascites left. Moreover, serum albumin and IgG rose to normal values after 3 months (4.3âg/dL and 501âmg/dL, respectively). LESSONS: This case suggests that in presence of IL both primary and secondary causes should be evaluated. On the other hand, genetic diagnosis is crucial not only for diagnosis but also for prognosis in HS. Life expectancy and quality could deeply vary among different gene mutations and protein variants of the same gene. Further studies and case reports are needed to better understand the clinical meaning of these genetic results and the role of CMV as trigger of IL.","Fattorusso, Antonella; Pieri, Elena Sofia; Dell039,; Isola, Giovanni Battista; Prontera, Paolo; Mencaroni, Elisabetta; Stangoni, Gabriela; Esposito, Susanna",Medicine (Baltimore),155,1

As such, RBD has become the major target for vaccine development, while RBD-specific antibodies are pursued as therapeutics. Here, we report the development and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific VHH/nanobody (Nb) from immunized alpacas. Seven RBD-specific Nbs with high stability were identified using phage display. They bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with affinity KD ranging from 2.6 to 113 nM, and six of them can block RBD-ACE2 interaction. The fusion of the Nbs with IgG1 Fc resulted in homodimers with greatly improved RBD-binding affinities (KD ranging from 72.7 pM to 4.5 nM) and nanomolar RBD-ACE2 blocking abilities. Furthermore, the fusion of two Nbs with non-overlapping epitopes resulted in hetero-bivalent Nbs, namely aRBD-2-5 and aRBD-2-7, with significantly higher RBD binding affinities (KD of 59.2 pM and 0.25 nM) and greatly enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing potency. The 50% neutralization dose (ND50) of aRBD-2-5 and aRBD-2-7 was 1.22 ng/mL (â¼0.043 nM) and 3.18 ng/mL (â¼0.111 nM), respectively. These high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 blocking Nbs could be further developed into therapeutics as well as diagnostic reagents for COVID-19.ImportanceTo date, SARS-CoV-2 has caused tremendous loss of human life and economic output worldwide. Although a few COVID-19 vaccines have been approved in several countries, the development of effective therapeutics, including SARS-CoV-2 targeting antibodies, remains critical. Due to their small size (13-15 kDa), high solubility, and stability, Nbs are particularly well suited for pulmonary delivery and more amenable to engineer into multivalent formats than the conventional antibody. Here, we report a series of new anti-SARS-CoV-2 Nbs isolated from immunized alpaca and two engineered hetero-bivalent Nbs. These potent neutralizing Nbs showed promise as potential therapeutics against COVID-19.","Ma, Huan; Zeng, Weihong; Meng, Xiangzhi; Huang, Xiaoxue; Yang, Yunru; Zhao, Dan; Zhou, Peigen; Wang, Xiaofang; Zhao, Changcheng; Sun, Yong; Wang, Peihui; Ou, Huichao; Hu, Xiaowen; Xiang, Yan; Jin, Tengchuan",J. virol,155,23

To date, methods to predict the clinical course, which ranges from the asymptomatic carrier to the critically ill patient in devastating multi-system organ failure, have yet to be identified. In this study, we performed large-scale integrative multi-omics analyses of serum obtained from COVID-19 patients with the goal of uncovering novel pathogenic complexities of this disease and identifying molecular signatures that predict clinical outcomes. We assembled a novel network of protein-metabolite interactions in COVID-19 patients through targeted metabolomic and proteomic profiling of serum samples in 330 COVID-19 patients compared to 97 non-COVID, hospitalized controls. Our network identified distinct protein-metabolite cross talk related to immune modulation, energy and nucleotide metabolism, vascular homeostasis, and collagen catabolism. Additionally, our data linked multiple proteins and metabolites to clinical indices associated with long-term mortality and morbidity, such as acute kidney injury. Finally, we developed a novel composite outcome measure for COVID-19 disease severity and created a clinical prediction model using a set of 33 metabolites.

The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells requires the activation of its spike protein by host cell proteases. The serine protease, TMPRSS2, and cysteine proteases, Cathepsins B/L, activate spike protein and enable SARS-CoV-2 entry to the host cell through two completely different and independent pathways. Therefore, inhibiting either TMPRSS2 or cathepsin B/L may not sufficiently block the virus entry. We here hypothesized that simultaneous targeting of both the entry pathways would be more efficient to block the virus entry rather than targeting the entry pathways individually. To this end, we utilized the network-based drug repurposing analyses to identify the possible common drugs that can target both the entry pathways. This study, for the first time, reports the molecules like cyclosporine, calcitriol, and estradiol as candidate drugs with the binding ability to the host proteases, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin B/L. Next, we analyzed drug-gene and gene-gene interaction networks using 332 human targets of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The network results indicate that, out of 332 human proteins, cyclosporine interacts with 216 (65%) proteins. Furthermore, we performed molecular docking and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the binding of drug with TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. The molecular docking and MD simulation results showed strong and stable binding of cyclosporine A (CsA) with TMPRSS2 and CTSL genes. The above results indicate cyclosporine as a potential drug molecule, as apart from interacting with SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors, it also interacts with most of SARS-CoV-2 target host genes; thus it could potentially interfere with functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells. We here also suggest that these antiviral drugs alone or in combination can simultaneously target both the entry pathways and thus can be considered as a potential treatment option for COVID-19.","Prasad, Kartikay; Ahamad, Shahzaib; Kanipakam, Hema; Gupta, Dinesh; Kumar, Vijay",ACS Chem Neurosci,155,1

BACKGROUND: CT might have a prognostic predictive value beyond its diagnostic value. METHODS: Sixty-eight patients, 32 with cytokine storm and 36 without cytokine storm, were included in the study. Four different scoring methods were created according to elementary lesions, distribution and involvement rate. CT scores and demographic findings of the cases were compared in the cytokine storm and non-cytokine storm groups. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 57.72 (SD: 13.5) and 40 (58.8 %) of them were male. The cytokine storm was significantly more common among male patients and patients of older age (p=0.04). The AUC values of CT score 1, CT score 2, CT score 3, and CT score 4 were as follows; 0.772 (95% CI; 0.651-0.892), 0.766 (95% CI; 0.647-0.885), 0.758 (95% CI; 0.639-8.78), and 0.760 (95% CI; 0.640-0.881), respectively. All CT scores had better predictive values in males. CONCLUSIONS: CT scoring at the time of admission can be used to predict cases that may develop cytokine storm later (Tab. 4, Fig. 2, Ref. 15).","Ozturk, C; Gungor, O; Koc, F; Goktas, E F; Dereli, N; Corbacioglu, S K; Ramadan, S U",Bratisl Lek Listy,155,24

Telemedicine involves the electronic exchange of medical information between two remote sites for the optimization of patient care, whereas telehealth is the application of all electronic communication and delivery systems in the provision of healthcare. Telehealth gives patients an opportunity to communicate with their healthcare providers and, overall, access ambulatory care that otherwise is not available in their area of residence. Several telehealth delivery systems are available for electronic communication. Telehealth and other communications technologies used in the delivery of healthcare services are regulated at both the federal and state levels. Coverage and payment policies vary among the different insurers (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and private plans), and policies may further be defined by state telehealth parity laws. Telenutrition involves the use of digital technology to provide nutrition care to patients and caregivers and shows potential to optimize nutrition care and outcomes. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has contributed to sweeping legislative and regulatory changes that allowed the temporary expansion of telehealth delivery and reimbursement to maintain continuity of care for patients who were not able to come in for an in-person office visit with their healthcare provider.

The goal of the present was to assess Spanish citizens’ physical activity practice at the end of the first week of the home quarantine. A total of 1858 Spanish citizens, 674 males and 1184 females (M = 40.18, SD = 15.84 years) agreed to participate. The study is descriptive in nature, based on an on-line questionnaire conducted seven days after the mandatory shelter-at-home health order issued by the Spanish Government. It included The International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Anthropometric parameters, Sociometric and COVID-19 information. Global results showed that the vast majority of the confined population was below the World Health Organization recommendations on Vigorous Physical Activity, Moderate Physical Activity or a combination. Physical activity practice was dependent on personal factors such as gender, age or weight, but also on contextual factors such as living with a dependent person or the type of house (square meters, having a balcony or a backyard). Insufficient physical activity has been considered a prominent risk factor for non-communicable diseases, mental health and, consequently, quality of life.

Although attention should now be paid to the experiences of students after they returned to campus, few studies have explored the factors and mechanisms that have influenced these students' school adaptation. The present study investigated the multiple roles of social support and resilience in mediating associations the relationship between Chinese university students' interpersonal relationships and their school adaptation during COVID-19 control period. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 4534 Chinese university students (Mage = 19.70, SD = 1.14) at two universities in Jiangxi provinces. The independent variable was interpersonal relationships; mediating variables were social support and resilience; and the dependent variable was school adaptation. Multiple mediation analysis was performed using the MPlus software. RESULTS: Controlling for demographic variables, the quality of students' interpersonal relationships was significantly and positively related to their school adaptation, with students' ratings of social support and resilience mediating these associations. More interestingly, social support and resilience played multiple mediating roles in the relationship between interpersonal relationships and school adaptation. LIMITATIONS: The age stage of the sample and the methods in which the data were collected may affect the generalizability of the results. CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19 control period, interpersonal relationships can influence school adaptation either directly or indirectly by enhancing social support or resilience (parallel mediation) or by activating resilience via the experience of social support (serial mediation). This study's results emphasize the role of interpersonal relationships, as well as the contributions of positive external and internal factors on students' school adaptation during the epidemic control period. Accordingly, these findings may have implications for the mental health education of college students in the post-epidemic era.","Zhang, Xing; Huang, Peng-Fei; Li, Bi-Qin; Xu, Wen-Jian; Li, Wen; Zhou, Bin",J Affect Disord,155,21

Nonetheless, it remains poorly understood due to the difficulty of observing this faint region (1.5-3 solar radii). New observations from the GOES Solar Ultraviolet Imager in August and September 2018 provide the first comprehensive look at this region's characteristics and long-term evolution in extreme ultraviolet (EUV). Our analysis shows that the dominant emission mechanism here is resonant scattering rather than collisional excitation, consistent with recent model predictions. Our observations highlight that solar wind structures in the heliosphere originate from complex dynamics manifesting in the middle corona that do not occur at lower heights. These data emphasize that low-coronal phenomena can be strongly influenced by inflows from above, not only by photospheric motion, a factor largely overlooked in current models of coronal evolution. This study reveals the full kinematic profile of the initiation of several coronal mass ejections, filling a crucial observational gap that has hindered understanding of the origins of solar eruptions. These new data uniquely demonstrate how EUV observations of the middle corona provide strong new constraints on models seeking to unify the corona and heliosphere.","Seaton, Daniel B.; Hughes, J.

In that literature, much attention has been devoted to comparing the unequal impacts of COVID-19 on the research activities of women and men, with studies demonstrating that women's research productivity has been disproportionately disrupted, in ways that are likely to have detrimental effects in the short- and long-term. In this paper, I discuss that emerging literature on gender inequalities in pandemic academic productivity. I reflect on the questions asked, the issues centered and the assumptions made within this literature, devoting particular attention to how authors conceptualize academic labor and productivity, on one hand, and gender, on the other. I show that this literature makes major contributions to exposing old and new gender inequalities in academia, but argue that it also risks reproducing some problematic assumptions about gender and about academic work. Discussing those assumptions and their effects, I identify some important questions for us to consider as we expand this literature and deepen our understanding of the complex gendered effects of COVID-19 on academic labor.","Pereira, Maria do Mar","Gender, work and organization",155,4

However, their ability to interact with proteins involved in pathologies of social relevance is a feature that still requires investigation. The worrying situation currently observed worldwide for the COVID-19 pandemic urgently requires the research of novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 molecular weapons, whose discovery can be aided by in silico predictive studies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work is to explore by spectroscopic methods novel features of a thymine-bearing nucleopeptide based on L-diaminopropanoic acid, including conformational aspects as well as its ability to bind proteins, starting from bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein. Moreover, in consideration of the importance of targeting viral proteins in the current fight against COVID-19, we evaluated in silico the interaction of the nucleopeptide with some of the most relevant coronavirus protein targets. METHODS: First, we investigated via circular dichroism (CD) the conformational behaviour of this thymine-bearing nucleopeptide with temperature: we observed CD spectral changes particularly passing from 15 to 35 °C. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis of the nucleopeptide was also conducted on nucleopeptide solid samples. Additionally, CD binding and in silico investigations were performed with BSA as a model protein. In particular, molecular dockings were run using as targets some of the main SARS-CoV-2 proteins. RESULTS: The temperature-dependent CD behaviour reflected the three-dimensional rearrangement of the nucleopeptide at different temperatures, with a higher exposure to the solvent of its chromophores at higher temperatures compared to a more stacked structure at low temperature. SEM analysis of nucleopeptide samples in the solid state showed a granular morphology, with a low roughness and some thread structures. Moreover, we found through spectroscopic studies that the modified peptide bound the albumin target by inducing significant changes to the protein secondary structure. CONCLUSION: CD and in silico studies suggested that the nucleopeptide bound the BSA protein with high affinity according to different binding modes, as testified by binding energy scores lower than -11 kcal/mol. Interestingly, a predictive study performed on 3CLpro and other SARS-CoV-2 protein targets suggested the potential ability of the nucleopeptide to bind with good affinity the main protease of the virus and other relevant targets including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, especially when complexed with RNA, the papain-like protease, and the coronavirus helicase at the nucleic acid binding site.","Roviello, Valentina; Musumeci, Domenica; Mokhir, Andriy; Roviello, Giovanni N",Curr. med. chem,155,1

METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 lineages from a public dataset of 5583 South American genome assemblies were analyzed. Polymorphisms in the main open reading frames were identified and compared to those in the main lineages of epidemiological concern: B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.351 (South Africa). RESULTS: Across 16 South American countries, 169 lineages were identified; major lineage B had the greatest diversity and broadest geographic distribution. Seventeen predominant lineages were analyzed revealing 2 dominant lineages of concern: P.1 (Brazilian variant) and B.1.1.7 with 94 and 28 genomes, respectively, both with 33 polymorphisms (other lineages displayed &#8804;24 polymorphisms). A high number of polymorphisms were detected with a limited number of common variable positions, in common with the profile of the main lineages of epidemiological concern. CONCLUSIONS: The ever-increasing genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 continues to lead to novel lineage emergence. Various variants and lineages are now present across South America, dominated by major lineage B.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in four universities in Guangdong Province (China) based on purposive sampling. A self-administered questionnaire was given to College students (CSs) to measure the supportive attitude towards an outbreak control strategy and adoption of NPIs in respondents. RESULTS: A total of 44,446 CSs participated between 31 January and 10 February 2020; 92.7% of respondents supported the outbreak control strategy. The proportion of respondents who avoided public places, wore a facemask, avoid gatherings, and washed hands more frequently than usual was 94.8, 92.8, 91.2 and 86.9%. respectively. A total of 76.5% respondents adopted all four measures. A supportive attitude was associated with NPI adoption. Students who were female, postgraduate, anxious, and not depressed tended to have a higher supportive attitude and higher chance of NPI adoption. CONCLUSIONS: Higher supportiveness towards the disease control strategy for the Chinese public may lead to higher adoption rate of NPIs. Psychosocial factors were related to a supportive attitude and adoption of the NPI. We believe that our findings could aid policymakers to create NPIs to prevent and control emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","Shen, Dong; Liu, Dan; Cai, Miaochun; Chen, Peiliang; Wang, Zhenghe; Zhang, Yujie; Li, Zhihao; Zhang, Xiru; Wu, Xianbo; Yang, Xingfen; Mao, Chen",BMC Public Health,155,26

In many low-resource hospitals, severely ill hypoxemic Covid-19 patients are treated with various forms of low-flow oxygen therapy (0-15 L/min), including interfaces such as a nasal cannula, Hudson mask, venturi-mask, and non-rebreather masks. When 15L/min of pure oxygen flow is not sufficient for the patient, treatment guidelines suggest non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or high-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) as the next stage of treatment. However, administering HFNO in the general wards of a low-resource hospital is difficult due to several factors, including difficulty in operation, unavailability of electric power outlets, and frequent maintenance. Therefore, in many cases, the highest level of care a patient receives in the general ward is 15L/min of oxygen on a Non-Rebreather Mask. With a shortage of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, this is a major problem since intermediate forms of treatments are simply not available at an affordable cost. To address this gap, we have developed a low-cost CPAP system specifically designed for low-resource hospitals. The device is a precision venturi-based flow-generator capable of providing up to 60L/min of flow. The device utilizes the mechanics of a jet pump driven by high-pressure oxygen to increase the volumetric flow rate by entraining atmospheric air. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) can be attained between 40 - 100% using a dual-flowmeter. Consisting of a traditional 22mm breathing circuit, a non-vented CPAP mask, and a Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) valve, the CPAP can provide positive pressures between 5-20 cm H2O. The device is manufactured using local 3D printing and workshop facilities.","Ahmed, Md. Kawsar; Rashid, Meemnur; Alman, Kaisar Ahmed; Muhib, Farhan; Rahman, Saeedur; Hasan, Taufiq",,155,16

It is a study based on secondary data from the System of Surveillance of Risk Factors and Protection for Chronic Diseases by Telephone Survey conducted among Brazilian adults between 2007 and 2014. The consumption frequency and intensity (number of cups or cans per week) of soda or packaged juice was checked. Socio-demographic and behavioral data were the independent variables. The time-series trend of annual consumption was evaluated by means of Linear Regression. The factors (age, sex, region, work, schooling and TV screen time) associated with the consumption of these beverages were investigated by Poisson regression. There was a 32.7% reduction in soft drink or packaged juice consumption between 2007 and 2014. Factors associated with higher consumption were: male sex (p = 0.000); 18-29 year-age-range (p = 0.000); residence in the central-west, southeast and southern regions (p = 0.000); lower schooling (p = 0.616); being employed (p = 0.007) and more than 3 hours of TV screen time per day (p = 0.000). The analyses describe a downward trend in the consumption of soda or packaged fruit juice among adults in Brazil from 2007 to 2014.","Epifânio, Silvany Barros Olímpio; Silveira, Jonas Augusto Cardoso da; Menezes, Risia Cristina Egito de; Marinho, Patrícia Menezes; Brebal, Karine Maria de Melo; Longo-Silva, Giovana",Cien Saude Colet,155,16

the conflict between the sovereignty of member states and the powers of the EU institutions The author examines this contradiction through the prism of philosophical debates on the nature and future of a single European state In this regard, the article compares approaches to the possible constitutional structure of a single European political entity Third, the author argues that the recent deci sion of the Federal constitutional court of Germany aggravated the political and economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic The Court attacked the legality of the European Central Bank Programme aimed at supporting the economy of the Eurozone countries Although not formally related to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the decision of the Court jeopardized further EU pandemic response policy and, thus, prompted the adoption of unprecedented measures to stimulate economic growth in the region It is expected that the national debt of the member states should be distributed at the level of the European Commission, which in itself marks a move towards further integration Fourth, the decision of the Federal constitutional court is worth considering for other reasons The Court went into an open confrontation with the European Court of Justice In fact, the national court of a member state of the European Union acted as an arbitrator setting the limits of the supranational bodies' competences In addition, the judges of the Federal constitutional court subsequently became active in the political sphere In a series of interviews with the German press following the decision, the President of the Court criticized the ""liberal elites"" who ignore the interests of""normal people"" thus using the German court itself as a platform for correcting the course of further European integration В статье предпринимается попытка исследования конституционных аспектов дальнейшей европейской интеграции в условиях пандемии COVID-19 Во-первых, пандемия COVID-19 -

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of deficiency or insufficiency of vitamins C and E and associated factors among women of childbearing age, in Brazil. DESIGN AND SETTING: Systematic review and meta-analysis conducted at a Brazilian public university. METHODS: A search from index inception until May 2020 was conducted. Meta-analyses were performed using inverse variance for fixed models, with summary proportions calculation using Freeman-Tukey double arcsine (base case). Reporting and methodological quality were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool for prevalence studies. RESULTS: Our review identified 12 studies, comprising 1,316 participants, especially breastfeeding women. There was at least one quality weakness in all studies, mainly regarding sampling method (i.e. convenience sampling) and small sample size. The prevalence of vitamin C deficiency ranged from 0% to 40%. Only vitamin E deficiency was synthetized in meta-analyses, with mean prevalences of 6% regardless of the alpha-tocopherol cutoff in plasma, and 5% and 16% for cutoffs of < 1.6-12.0 mmol/l and < 16.2 mmol/l, respectively. The cumulative meta-analysis suggested that a trend to lower prevalence of vitamin E deficiency occurred in recent studies. CONCLUSIONS: Although the studies identified in this systematic review had poor methodological and reporting quality, mild-moderate vitamin C and E deficiencies were identified, especially in breastfeeding women. Thus, designing and implementing policies does not seem to be a priority, because the need has not been properly dimensioned among women of childbearing age in Brazil.

In many cases, this has challenged patient-centered care. We set out to examine individuals' attitudes toward shared decision making (SDM) and to identify predictors of participation preference during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online survey with a large convenience sample (N = 1061). Our main measures of interest were participants' generic and COVID-19-related participation preference as well as their acceptance and distress regarding a triage vignette. We also assessed anxiety, e-health literacy, and aspects of participants' health. We conducted group comparisons and multiple linear regression analyses on participation preference as well as triage acceptance. RESULTS: In generic decision making, most participants expressed a strong need for information and a moderate participation preference. In the hypothetical case of COVID-19 infection, most preferred physician-led decisions. Generic participation preference was the strongest predictor of COVID-19-related participation preference, followed by age, education, and anxiety. Furthermore, both higher generic and COVID-19-related participation preferences predicted lower triage acceptance. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate potential health care recipients' attitudes toward SDM during a severe health care crisis and emphasize that participation preference varies according to the context.","Köther, Anja K; Siebenhaar, Katharina U; Alpers, Georg W",Med Decis Making,155,1

In December 2019, a global public health concern started with the emergence of a new strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or 2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV) which has rapidly spread all over the world from its origin in Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus, which includes human SARS-CoV, MERS and two other human coronaviruses (HCoVs), HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. The fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is lower than the two previous coronavirus epidemics, but it is faster spreading and the large number of infected people with severe viral pneumonia and respiratory illness, showed SARS-CoV-2 to be highly contagious. Based on the current published evidence, herein we summarize the origin, genetics, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, preventions, diagnosis and up to date treatments of SARS-CoV-2 infections in comparison with those caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

Based on the finding, five factors influenced the preparedness of ODL among the lecturers;1) teaching experience, 2) number of family members, 3) enough number of devices, 4) enough internet data and 5) convenience in ODL. Besides, the overall model explained further that 93.65% of the sample was classified correctly. © 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.","Adnan, N. I. M.; Wahid, S. N.

Immigrant hotel and foodservice workers face excess chronic stress and related syndemic risks, exacerbated by social, political, and economic inequities. COVID-19 has suddenly intensified the stressful and already difficult circumstances of immigrant service sector workers. The travel and tourism sector is one of the hardest hit due to widespread travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders designed to curb infection spread. Restrictions and lockdowns have devastated tourism-dependent destinations and displaced millions of vulnerable workers, causing them to lose their livelihoods. Compared to the general workforce, a sizeable increase in occupational stress has already been observed in the hospitality/tourism sector over the past 15–20 years.

Seven closed-ended questions were included in the questionnaire. Respondents were to indicate how frequently they experienced specific issues in the previous fortnight: Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge;being unable to stop or control worrying;worrying too much generally;trouble relaxing;being so restless that it's hard to sit still;becoming easily annoyed or irritable, feeling afraid of something awful happening. Participants were required to tick one of four choices for each of the seven parameters - not at all (0), several days (1), more than half the days (2) and nearly every day (3). A person with minimal or no anxiety will score less than 5. The survey was anonymous and circulated in professional online doctors' forums. Participation was voluntary and no incentives were given.Result273 completed surveys were received;120 doctors were in primary care and 153 were in secondary care. Average GAD7 score was 6.4 in primary care and 7.9 in secondary care. 57% of primary care doctors and 66% of secondary care doctors reported score of 5 or more, representing at least mild anxiety symptoms. 22% doctors in primary care and 31% doctors in secondary care reported GAD7 score of 10 or more, indicating moderate to severe anxiety. One in ten doctors in both primary and secondary care reported severe anxiety due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.ConclusionThe finding of more anxiety in secondary care doctors might be because general practitioners could resort early in the pandemic to remote consultations along with inadequacy of resources, greater exposure to suffering/deaths of patients and colleagues in hospital and perceived risk of catching COVID-19 infection.Results are limited due to relatively low numbers and it would be useful to replicate this study on a larger scale. Doctors are less likely to acknowledge their mental health difficulties due to stigma associated with mental health.Many employers have psychological support systems in place for their staff, but it is questionable if affected individuals are willing to receive this support. This paper;therefore, calls for creating open anonymous platforms for professionals to get access to appropriate support to address their anxiety.","Mittal, Shweta Abdalla Abouebeid",BJPsych Open,155,1

Due to these settings, a lot of strategic changes are adopted by healthcare facilities to ensure continuity in patient-centered services. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of structural and operational changes made in ambulatory care pharmacy services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A retrospective comparative study was conducted to evaluate the impact and effectiveness of patient-centered interventions and consequent access to medication management care within Johns Hopkins Aramco Health Care ambulatory care pharmacy services during the COVID-19 pandemic by comparing patient-centered key performance indicators before and during COVID-19 pandemic for a total of 4 months. Results: As a result of the structural and operational changes made in patient-centered ambulatory care pharmacy services during the COVID-19 pandemic, a 48% prescriptions requests and 90% prescriptions fills are increased through online health portal application. A three-fold increase in the pharmacy call center utilization resulted in around 10% abandoned calls. In the number of physical visits to ambulatory care pharmacies, a 37% reduction was also noted. The decrease in staff schedule efficiency and an increase in average prescription waiting time were also noticed. The prescription collection through remote area pick up locations, and medication home delivery services were successful during COVID-19 pandemic as supported by statistical data. Conclusion: The access to ambulatory care pharmacy services during COVID-19 pandemic has been successfully maintained via medication home delivery, remote area pickup locations, pharmacy call-center consultations and refill requests, online health portal application services, and other measures, while reducing the number of physical visits to the JHAH hospital/clinic to ensure compliance with infection control and prevention measures.","Thorakkattil, Shabeer A.; Nemr, Habib S.; Al-Ghamdi, Fuad H.; Jabbour, Rita J.; Al-Qaaneh, Ayman M.",Res.

However, none of the LT4SG work and their critiques suggest principled techniques for prioritization of the technologies and methods for inclusion of the end-user during the development cycle. Drawing inspiration from the fields of Economics, Ethics, Psychology, and Participatory Design, here we chart out a set of methodologies for prioritizing LT4SG that are aligned with the end-user preferences.

Kinetic studies showed that acidic conditions were more conducive to the ozone degradation of BPAF than alkaline conditions. In the presence of common anions, Br- and SO42- promoted the degradation of BPAF, whereas NO2-, NO3-, HSO3- inhibited the degradation, and the other anions and cations had no significant effect. The degradation products were analyzed by mass spectrometry, and were mainly manifested in hydroxylation, carboxylation and cleavage of benzene ring. The addition of NO2-, HSO3- and Br-produced the corresponding free radicals, resulting in the parent compound being attacked and affecting the degradation efficiency and pathways. The theoretical calculated results showed that the ortho-site of the BPAF phenolic hydroxyl group was more active than the meta-position, and it's more likely for free radicals to attack ortho-sites and initiate substitution reactions. Toxicity assessment of the products in the process of ozone degradation showed that toxicity of the products was reduced by benzene ring cleavage and a reduction in the F atomic number. However, the toxicity of nitro and brominated products of BPAF was increased. These findings provide some new insights into the role of common ions in ozonation process and product formation, and supplement the existing conclusions. The results of this study remind future researchers to concern that inorganic ions in real water may be converted into corresponding free radicals that affect the formation of ozone oxidation products.","Tian, Jie; Li, Beibei; Qu, Ruijuan; Zhou, Dongmei; Sun, Cheng; Wang, Zunyao; Zhu, Feng",Chemosphere,155,33

The lack of highly efficacious antiviral drugs that can manage this ongoing global emergency gives urgency to establishing a comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. We characterized the role of the nucleocapsid protein (N) of SARS-CoV-2 in modulating antiviral immunity. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 N resulted in the attenuation of retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptor-mediated interferon (IFN) production and IFN-induced gene expression. Similar to the SARS-CoV-1 N protein, SARS-CoV-2 N suppressed the interaction between tripartate motif protein 25 (TRIM25) and RIG-I. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 N inhibited polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)]-mediated IFN signaling at the level of Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and interfered with the association between TBK1 and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), subsequently preventing the nuclear translocation of IRF3. We further found that both type I and III IFN production induced by either the influenza virus lacking the nonstructural protein 1 or the Zika virus were suppressed by the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Our findings provide insights into the molecular function of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein with respect to counteracting the host antiviral immune response.","Oh, Soo Jin; Shin, Ok Sarah",,155,20

Fear of an imminent saturation of available ICU beds generated the notion that rationing of intensive care resources could have been necessary. RESULTS: In order to evaluate the impact of Covid-19 on the ICU capacity to manage critically ill patients, we performed a retrospective analysis of the first 2 weeks of the outbreak (February 24-March 8). Data were collected from regional registries and from a case report form sent to participating sites. ICU beds increased from 1545 to 1989 (28.7%), and patients receiving respiratory support outside the ICU increased from 4 (0.6%) to 260 (37.0%). Patients receiving respiratory support outside the ICU were significantly older [65 vs. 77 years], had more cerebrovascular (5.8 vs. 13.1%) and renal (5.3 vs. 10.0%) comorbidities and less obesity (31.4 vs. 15.5%) than patients admitted to the ICU.

After the first wave, several countries, notably in the European Union, are suffering a very rapid increase in the number of cases in the pandemic second wave. Health systems are under stress; hospital beds and ICU beds are increasingly occupied by COVID-19 patients, and hospitals are struggling to keep their normal operations. We review some basic epidemiological data of this new disease, regarding its appearance, reproductive rate, ways of transmission, number of cases, death rate, usefulness of diagnostic tests, basic treatment options, and prevention and control strategies, including vaccines. RECENT FINDINGS: The basic control strategy falls into two well established categories: active attack (control) or organized defense (mitigation). The control strategy relies on classic testing, tracing, and tracking possible cases of COVID-19. Those actions draw from classical epidemiology: to actively find and detect cases, isolate if positive for 10 days and treat when needed. At the same time, the search for close contacts, test them when needed and quarantine and monitor for 10 to 14 days in order to break chains of transmission. The mitigation strategy include basic measures to protect people at increased risk of severe illness, like social distancing, wearing a mask when social distancing is not possible, avoiding crowds, avoiding indoor crowded spaces, increase ventilation indoors and washing or sanitizing hands often. They include also targeted restrictions in people's mobility, and lock-downs, widely used during the first wave in order to spare the health system, become overwhelmed and increasingly used in Europe once more in the current strong second wave. Waiting for effective and safe vaccines and treatments, stopping the ongoing COVID-19 transmission is our only defense wall. We do not know yet which strategy or strategies worked best. We all must work as a team to give an adequate response to this pandemic. We have just one world and one health. Nobody will be safe until everybody is safe.","Vilella, Anna; Trilla, Antoni",Curr Allergy Asthma Rep,155,22

METHODS: We searched https://clinicaltrials.gov/and retrieved all clinical trials on COVID-19 from January 1, 2020 to June 26, 2020. As a comparator group, we have chosen two fields that are not related to emerging infections and infectious diseases: and considered not directly affected by the pandemic: breast cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and included studies within the aforementioned study period as well as those registered in the preceding year (pre-study period: January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019). Gender of the investigator was predicted using the genderize.io API (application programming interface). The repository of the datasets used to collect and analyse the data available at https://osf.io/k2r57/. RESULTS: Only 27.8% (430/1548) of principal investigators (PIs) among COVID-19-related studies were women, which is significantly different compared to 54.9% (156/284) and 42.1% (56/133) for breast cancer (p<0.005) and T2DM (p<0.005) trials over the same period, respectively. During this ""pre-study"" period, the proportion of PIs who were predicted to be women were 49.7% (245/493) and 44.4% (148/333) for breast cancer and T2DM trials, respectively and the difference was not statistically significant when compared to results from the study period (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that less than one-third of COVID-19-related clinical trials are led by women PIs, half the proportion observed in non-COVID-19 trials over the same period which remained similar to the pre-study period. These gender disparities during the pandemic may indicate not only a lack of women's leadership in international clinical trials and involvement in new projects but also may reveal imbalances in women's access to research activities and funding during health emergencies.","Cevik, Muge; Haque, Syed Arefinul; Manne-Goehler, Jennifer; Kuppalli, Krutika; Sax, Paul E; Majumder, Maimuna S; Orkin, Chloe",Clin. microbiol. infect,155,13

RECENT FINDINGS: Most thoracic surgery is performed under general endotracheal anesthesia with either a double lumen endotracheal tube or a bronchial blocker. In an attempt to lessen the incidence and severity of postoperative complications, the nonintubated video-assisted thoracoscopic technique was developed, where the surgical procedure is performed under regional anesthesia with sedation. Currently, this technique is recommended for the elderly and in patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease who are at increased risk of complications after general anesthesia. It is the role of the anesthesia team to assist in the decisions whether the patient is a candidate and which block should be performed and to carefully monitor these patients in the operating room. SUMMARY: Nonintubated video-assisted thoracic surgery is an emerging technique with the goal of reducing postoperative complications. The anesthetic technique is highly variable and ranges from general anesthesia with a laryngeal mask airway with a truncal block to thoracic epidural anesthesia with minimal to no block. It is important to have excellent communication with the surgical team and the patient to ensure a safe, successful procedure.","Gelzinis, Theresa",Curr Anesthesiol Rep,155,1

We assembled a database of 191 ARS cases using the Medical Treatment Protocols for Radiation Accident Victims (METREPOL, n=167) and the System for Evaluation and Archiving of Radiation accidents based on Case Histories (SEARCH, n=24) for training purposes of medical personnel. From 2016-2019 we trained 39 participants comprising MSc level radiobiology students in an on-site teaching class. Enforced by the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 for the first time, an online teaching of nine MSc radiobiology students replaced the on-site teaching. We found that: (1) limitations of correct diagnostic decision-making based on clinical signs and symptoms were experienced unrelated to the teaching format. (2) A significant performance decrease concerning online (first number in parenthesis) versus on-site teaching (reference and second number in parenthesis) was seen regarding the estimate time (31 vs 61 cases per hour, 2-fold decrease, p=0.005). Also, the accurate assessment of response categories (89.9% vs 96.9%, p=0.001), ARS (92.4% vs 96.7%, p=0.002) and hospitalization (93.5% vs 97.0%, p=0.002) decreased by around 3-7%.

We report the results of a Phase 2a trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and antiviral efficacy of molnupiravir in the treatment of COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04405570). Methods: Eligible participants included outpatients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptom onset within 7 days. Participants were randomized 1:1 to 200 mg molnupiravir or placebo, or 3:1 to molnupiravir (400 or 800 mg) or placebo, twice daily for 5 days. Antiviral activity was assessed as time to undetectable levels of viral RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and time to elimination of infectious virus isolation from nasopharyngeal swabs. Results: Among 202 treated participants, virus isolation was significantly lower in participants receiving 800 mg molnupiravir (1.9%) versus placebo (16.7%) at Day 3 (p = 0.02). At Day 5, virus was not isolated from any participants receiving 400 or 800 mg molnupiravir, versus 11.1% of those receiving placebo (p = 0.03). Time to viral RNA clearance was decreased and a greater proportion overall achieved clearance in participants administered 800 mg molnupiravir versus placebo (p = 0.01). Molnupiravir was generally well tolerated, with similar numbers of adverse events across all groups.

However, this field is often challenged by the limited ability to deliver and control sensory stimuli, especially when going beyond audio–visual events and outside laboratory settings. In this review, we examine the scope and challenges of new technology in the study of multisensory integration in a world that is increasingly characterized as a fusion of physical and digital/virtual events. We discuss multisensory integration research through the lens of novel multisensory technologies and, thus, bring research in human–computer interaction, experimental psychology, and neuroscience closer together. Today, for instance, displays have become volumetric so that visual content is no longer limited to 2D screens, new haptic devices enable tactile stimulation without physical contact, olfactory interfaces provide users with smells precisely synchronized with events in virtual environments, and novel gustatory interfaces enable taste perception through levitating stimuli. These technological advances offer new ways to control and deliver sensory stimulation for multisensory integration research beyond traditional laboratory settings and open up new experimentations in naturally occurring events in everyday life experiences. Our review then summarizes these multisensory technologies and discusses initial insights to introduce a bridge between the disciplines in order to advance the study of multisensory integration.","Cornelio, Patricia; Velasco, Carlos; Obrist, Marianna",Front Neurosci,155,27

Currently, a virulent PEDV CH/YNKM-8/2013 and a CV777 vaccine strain-like AH-M have been successfully isolated from the clinical samples. To dissect out the underlying pathogenic mechanism of virulent PEDV and clarify the differences between virulent and CV777 vaccine strain-like PEDV infections, we performed an iTRAQ-based comparative quantitative proteomic study of Vero cells infected with both PEDV strains. A total of 661 and 474 differentially expressed proteins were identified upon virulent and CV777 vaccine strain-like isolates infection, respectively. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was employed to investigate the canonical pathways and functional networks involved in both PEDV infections. Comprehensive studies have revealed that the PEDV virulent strain suppressed protein synthesis of Vero cells through down-regulating mTOR as well as its downstream targets 4EBP1 and p70S6K activities, which were validated by immunoblotting. In addition, the virulent strain could activate NF-κB pathway more intensively than the CV777 vaccine strain-like isolate, and elicit stronger inflammatory cascades as well. These data might provide new insights for elucidating the specific pathogenesis of PEDV infection, and pave the way for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Porcine epidemic diarrhea is now worldwide distributed and causing huge economic losses to swine industry. The immunomodulation and pathogenesis between PEDV and host, as well as the difference between virulent and attenuated strains of PEDV infections are still largely unknown. In this study, we presented for the first application of proteomic analysis to compare whole cellular protein alterations induced by virulent and CV777 vaccine strain-like PEDV infections, which might contribute to understand the pathogenesis of PEDV and anti-viral strategy development.","Guo, Xiaozhen; Hu, Han; Chen, Fangzhou; Li, Zhonghua; Ye, Shiyi; Cheng, Shuang; Zhang, Mengjia; He, Qigai",J Proteomics,155,20

We aim to evaluate the efficacy of adjunctive corticosteroids in the management of COVID-19. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized adults ([â¥]18 years) who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were given treatment. Treatment included hydroxycholoroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir. Corticosteroids were included as adjunctive therapy in mid-April, 2020. We compared composite outcomes of clinical progression and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) or death between group that received treatment only (Group A) versus group that received adjunctive corticosteroids (Group B). Entropy balancing was used to generate stabilized weight for covariates between treatment groups. Unweighted Kaplan-Meir curves, weighted and adjusted Cox regression analysis were used to estimate effect of adjunctive corticosteroids on composite outcomes. Subgroup analysis was performed on those with pneumonia. Results: Of 1046 patients with COVID-19, 57 received treatment alone (Group A) and 35 received adjunctive corticosteroids in addition to treatment (Group B). Median day of illness at treatment initiation was 5 day. There were 44 patients with pneumonia; 68.9% of them were not requiring supplemental oxygen at treatment initiation. Overall, 17 (18.5%) of 92 patients had clinical progression including 13 (22.8%) of 57 patients in Group A versus 4 (11.4%) of 35 patients in Group B (p=0.172). Unweighted Kaplan-Meier estimates showed no significant difference in the proportion of patients who had clinical progression or invasive MV or death between the 2 treatment groups. However in those with pneumonia, there were lower proportions of patients in Group B with clinical progression (11.1% , 95% CI 0.0 - 22.2 versus 58.8%, 95% CI 27.3 - 76.7, log rank p<0.001 ); and invasive MV or death (11.3%, 95% CI 0.0 - 22.5 versus 41.2%, 95% CI 12.4. - 60.5, log rank p=0.016). In weighted and adjusted cox regression analysis, patients in Group B were less likely to have clinical progression, (adjusted HR [aHR] 0.08, 95% CI 0.01-0.99, p=0.049) but there was no statistical significant difference in risk of requiring invasive MV or death (aHR 0.22, 95%CI 0.02 - 2.54, p=0.22). In subgroup with pneumonia, patients in Group B were significantly at lower risk of clinical progression (aHR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 - 0.39, p<0.001) and requiring invasive MV compared to Group A (aHR 0.30, 0.10-0.87, p=0.029).

The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of enterovirus (EV) involved in CNS infections in children. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from children (0–16 years) with suspected meningitis–encephalitis (ME) who were hospitalized in the largest pediatric hospital of Greece from October 2017 to September 2020 was initially tested for 14 common pathogens using the multiplex PCR FilmArray(®) ME Panel (FA-ME). CSF samples positive for EV, as well as pharyngeal swabs and stools of the same children, were further genotyped employing Sanger sequencing. Of the 330 children tested with FA-ME, 75 (22.7%) were positive for EV and 50 different CSF samples were available for genotyping. The median age of children with EV CNS infection was 2 months (IQR: 1–60) and 44/75 (58.7%) of them were male. There was a seasonal distribution of EV CNS infections, with most cases detected between June and September (38/75, 50.7%). EV genotyping was successfully processed in 84/104 samples: CSF (n = 45/50), pharyngeal swabs (n = 15/29) and stools (n = 24/25). Predominant EV genotypes were CV-B5 (16/45, 35.6%), E30 (10/45, 22.2%), E16 (6/45, 13.3%) and E11 (5/45, 11.1%). However, significant phylogenetic differences from previous described isolates were detected. No unusual neurologic manifestations were observed, and all children recovered without obvious acute sequelae. Specific EV circulating genotypes are causing a significant number of pediatric CNS infections. Phylogenetic analysis of these predominant genotypes found genetic differences from already described EV isolates.","Posnakoglou, Lamprini; Tatsi, Elizabeth-Barbara; Chatzichristou, Panagiota; Siahanidou, Tania; Kanaka-Gantenbein, Christina; Syriopoulou, Vasiliki; Michos, Athanasios",Viruses,155,20

Its most serious side effect is pulmonary fibrosis and impaired lung function. Using A549 human lung cells it is shown that, in parallel to an increased cell toxicity and DNA damage, BLM causes a marked enlargement of the cell nucleus. This effect is abolished by inorganic polyphosphate (polyP), if this physiological polymer is administered together with BLM. The detoxification of BLM is–most likely–caused by the upregulation of the gene encoding the BLM hydrolase which inactivates BLM in vitro and in vivo. This study contributes also to a rational application in COVID-19 patients since polyP prevents binding of SARS-CoV-2 to host cells. ABSTRACT: The anti-cancer antitumor antibiotic bleomycin(s) (BLM) induces athyminic sites in DNA after its activation, a process that results in strand splitting. Here, using A549 human lung cells or BEAS-2B cells lunc cells, we show that the cell toxicity of BLM can be suppressed by addition of inorganic polyphosphate (polyP), a physiological polymer that accumulates and is released from platelets. BLM at a concentration of 20 µg ml(−1) causes a decrease in cell viability (by ~70%), accompanied by an increased DNA damage and chromatin expansion (by amazingly 6-fold). Importantly, the BLM-caused effects on cell growth and DNA integrity are substantially suppressed by polyP. In parallel, the enlargement of the nuclei/chromatin in BLM-treated cells (diameter, 20–25 µm) is normalized to ~12 µm after co-incubation of the cells with BLM and polyP. A sequential application of the drugs (BLM for 3 days, followed by an exposure to polyP) does not cause this normalization. During co-incubation of BLM with polyP the gene for the BLM hydrolase is upregulated. It is concluded that by upregulating this enzyme polyP prevents the toxic side effects of BLM. These data might also contribute to an application of BLM in COVID-19 patients, since polyP inhibits binding of SARS-CoV-2 to cellular ACE2.","Müller, Werner E.

Viruses may evolve at high, uneven, and fluctuating rates among genome sites. The accumulated changes, through either mutation or recombination with other species, are first fixed in the genome of successful individuals that give rise to genetic lineages. The relationship between biological lineages related by common descent is called ‘phylogeny’. For inferring phylogeny, the differences between aligned sequences of genomes and proteins are quantified and depicted in the form of a tree, in which contemporary species and their intermediate and common ancestors occupy, respectively, the terminal nodes, internal nodes, and the root. The tree is characterized by a topology, length of branches, shape, and the root position. A complex mathematical apparatus has been developed for phylogeny inference that can evaluate inter-species differences, facilitate tree building and comparison of trees, and assess the fit between data and tree through, typically, computationally intensive calculations. A reconstructed tree is an approximation of the true phylogeny that practically remains unknown. The phylogenetic analysis is used in applied and fundamental virus research, including epidemiology, diagnostics, forensic studies, phylogeography, evolutionary studies, and virus taxonomy. It can provide an evolutionary perspective on variation of any trait that can be measured for a group of viruses.","Gorbalenya, Alexander E.; Lauber, C.",Reference Module in Biomedical Sciences,155,24

Ideally, vaccines should induce a lifelong protective immunity against the target pathogen while not causing clinical or pathological signs of diseases in the vaccinated animals. However, such ideal vaccines are rare in the veterinary field. Many vaccines are either of limited effectiveness or have harmful side effects. In addition, there are still severe diseases with no effective vaccines. A very important criterion for an ideal vaccine in veterinary medicine is low cost; this is especially important in developing countries and even more so for poultry vaccination, where vaccines must sell for a few cents a dose. Traditional approaches include inactivated vaccines, attenuated live vaccines and subunit vaccines. Recently, genetic engineering has been applied to design new, improved vaccines. Adenovirus vectors are highly efficient for gene transfer in a broad spectrum of cell types and species. Moreover, adenoviruses often induce humoral, mucosal and cellular immune responses to antigens encoded by the inserted foreign genes. Thus, adenoviruses have become a vector of choice for delivery and expression of foreign proteins for vaccination. Consequently, the market requirements for adenovirus vaccines are increasing, creating a need for production methodologies of concentrated vectors with warranted purity and efficacy. This review summarizes recent developments and approaches of adenovirus production and purification as the application of these vectors, including successes and failures in clinical applications to date.","Ferreira, T B; Alves, P M; Aunins, J G; Carrondo, M J T",Gene Ther,155,26

Introduction SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current pandemic, predominantly affects the respiratory tract, and a growing number of publications report the predisposition of patients with COVID-19 to develop thrombotic phenomena. Objective To determine the prevalence of pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19; to determine the possible relationship between the severity of pulmonary involvement and D-dimer levels; to analyze the location of pulmonary embolisms in patients with COVID-19 and to compare it with the location in patients without COVID-19. Methods This retrospective study analyzed all CT angiograms of the pulmonary arteries done in patients with suspected pulmonary embolisms between March 15 and April 30, 2020 and compared them with studies done in the same period one year earlier. Results We included 492 pulmonary CT angiograms (342 (69.9%) in patients with COVID-19 and 147 (30.1%) in patients without COVID-19). The prevalence of pulmonary embolisms was higher in patients with COVID-19 (26% vs. 16.3% in patients without COVID-19, p=0.0197; relative risk=1.6). The prevalence of pulmonary embolisms in the same period in 2019 was 13.2%, similar to that of the group of COVID-19-negative patients in 2020 (p=0.43). There were no significant differences in D-dimer levels or the location of pulmonary embolisms between the two groups. CT showed moderate or severe pulmonary involvement in 78.7% of the patients with COVID-19. Conclusions Patients with COVID-19 have an increased prevalence of pulmonary embolisms (26%), and most (78.7%) have moderate or severe lung involvement on CT studies. The location of pulmonary embolisms and the degree of elevation of D-dimer levels does not differ between patients with COVID-19 and those without.","Chamorro, E. Martínez; Ostolaza, T. Y.

Unfortunately, information regarding the immunological characteristics in COVID-19 patients remains limited. Here we collected the blood samples from 18 healthy donors (HD) and 38 COVID-19 patients to analyze changes in the adaptive immune cell populations and phenotypes. In comparison to HD, the lymphocyte percentage was slightly decreased, the percentages of CD4 and CD8 T cells in lymphocytes are similar, whereas B cell percentage increased in COVID-19 patients. T cells, especially CD8 T cells, showed an enhanced expression of late activation marker CD25 and exhaustion marker PD-1. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 induced an increased percentage of T follicular helpher (Tfh)- and germinal center B-like (GCB-like) cells in the blood. However, the parameters in COVD-19 patients remained unchanged across various age groups. Therefore, we demonstrated that the T and B cells can be activated normally and exhibit functional features. These data provide a clue that the adaptive immunity in most people could be primed to induce a significant immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection upon receiving standard medical care.","Yang, Xiaofeng; Dai, Tongxin; Zhou, Xiaobo; Qian, Hongbo; Guo, Rui; Lei, Lei; Zhang, Xingzhe; Zhang, Dan; Shi, Lin; Cheng, Yanbin; Guo, Yaling; Hu, Jinsong; Zhang, Baojun",,155,7

While communication tools, networks and systems exist, current evidence suggests that they are only useful within particular contexts and several only target specific geographic areas. There is a need to unpack and explore the mechanisms of how and in what context such communication tools and their components are effective at facilitating international communication and coordination to keep food safe and mitigate the burden of foodborne disease around the world. A realist synthesis was undertaken to understand how and why certain processes and structures of communication tools, used during international food safety events, influence their utility and effectiveness according to different contextual factors. The focus of this review was explanatory and aimed to develop and refine theory regarding how contextual factors trigger specific processes and mechanisms to produce outcomes. Using the realist context–mechanism–outcome configuration of theory development, a range of sources was used to develop an initial programme theory, including the authors’ experience, a scoping review of published papers and grey literature and input from an expert reference committee. Literature was then systematically located and synthesised from several databases with input from the expert reference committee to refine the programme theory. The programme theory developed indicates that when a country has interests in food import or export, has the technical infrastructure to detect and respond to food safety events, and is governed in accordance with regional and/or global laws and regulations relating to food control and global health security, then specific mechanisms will facilitate various outcomes. Mechanisms include trust, experience, support, awareness, understanding, a sense of community, standardisation and intersectoral collaboration. The outcomes include using communication tools to relay information abroad and the prevention of foodborne diseases, among others. Components of such communication tools may be adapted according to different contextual factors to promote, support and improve their use. Improving international coordination and communication during international food safety events is in the interest of global health security and can mitigate the global burden of foodborne disease.

We developed a statistical framework to explore the association between molecular-level mutation activity of SARS-CoV-2 and population-level disease transmissibility of COVID-19. METHODS: We estimated the instantaneous transmissibility of COVID-19 by using the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)). The mutation activity in SARS-CoV-2 is quantified empirically depending on (i) the prevalence of emerged amino acid substitutions and (ii) the frequency of these substitutions in the whole sequence. Using the likelihood-based approach, a statistical framework is developed to examine the association between mutation activity and R(t). We adopted the COVID-19 surveillance data in California as an example for demonstration. RESULTS: We found a significant positive association between population-level COVID-19 transmissibility and the D614G substitution on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We estimate that a per 0.01 increase in the prevalence of glycine (G) on codon 614 is positively associated with a 0.49% (95% CI: 0.39 to 0.59) increase in R(t), which explains 61% of the R(t) variation after accounting for the control measures. We remark that the modeling framework can be extended to study other infectious pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a link between the molecular-level mutation activity of SARS-CoV-2 and population-level transmission of COVID-19 to provide further evidence for a positive association between the D614G substitution and R(t). Future studies exploring the mechanism between SARS-CoV-2 mutations and COVID-19 infectivity are warranted.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been shown to be the leading cause of mortality in COVID-19 patients, characterized by a hyper cytokine storm. Autoimmunity is proposed to occur as a result of COVID-19, given the high similarity of the immune responses observed in COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases. Here, we investigate the level of autoimmune antibodies in COVID-19 patients with different severities. Initial screening for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) IgG revealed that 1.6% (2/126) and 4% (5/126) of ICU COVID-19 cases developed strong and moderate ANA levels, respectively. However, all the non-ICU cases (n=273) were ANA negative. The high ANA level was confirmed by immunofluorescence (IFA) and large-scale autoantibody screening by phage immunoprecipitation-sequencing (PhIP-Seq). Indeed, the majority of the samples showed ""speckled"" ANA pattern by microscopy, and we demonstrate that samples of ICU patients with strong and moderate ANA levels contain autoantibody specificities that predominantly targeted proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction, metabolism, apoptotic processes, and cell death; further denoting reactivity to nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens. In conclusion, our results further support the notion of routine screening for autoimmune responses in COVID-19 patients, which might help improve disease prognosis and patient management.

Given the systemic pattern of Covid-19, there are many factors that can influence patient's functional capacity after acute infection and the identification of such factors can contribute to the development of specific rehabilitation strategies. Pulmonary impairment is the primary cause of hospitalization due to Covid-19, and can progress to SARS as well as increase length of hospitalization. Moreover, cardiac involvement is observed in approximately 30% of hospitalized patients, with an increased risk of acute myocarditis, myocardial injury, and heart failure, which may compromise functional capacity in the long-term. Thromboembolic complications have also been reported in some patients with Covid-19 and are associated with a poor prognosis. Musculoskeletal complications may result from long periods of hospitalization and immobility, and can include fatigue, muscle weakness and polyneuropathy. Studies that address the functional capacity of patients after Covid-19 infection are still scarce.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic created new challenges in both access to nature in public spaces and in cancer care. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the change in active and passive use of nature, places of engaging with nature and associations of nature contact with respect to improvements to perceived stress and symptom experience among breast cancer patients during the pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of people diagnosed with breast cancer using ResearchMatch (n = 56) in July 2020 (the first wave of COVID-19). In this US-based, predominantly white, affluent, highly educated, female sample, we found that, on average, participants were first diagnosed with breast cancer at 54 years old and at stage 2 or 3. Eighteen percent of participants experienced disruptions in their cancer care due to the pandemic. As expected, activities in public places significantly decreased as well, including use of parks/trails and botanical gardens. In contrast, spending time near home, on the porch or in the backyard significantly increased. Also observed were significant increases in indoor activities involving passive nature contact, such as watching birds through a window, listening to birdsong, and smelling rain or plants. Decreased usage of parks/trails was significantly associated with higher stress (Coef = −2.30, p = 0.030) and increased usage of the backyard/porch was significantly associated with lower stress (Coef = −2.69, p = 0.032), lower symptom distress (Coef = −0.80, p = 0.063) and lower symptom severity (Coef = −0.52, p = 0.009). The most commonly reported alternatives to outdoor engagement with nature were watching nature through a window (84%), followed by looking at images of nature (71%), and listening to nature through a window (66%). The least commonly enjoyed alternative was virtual reality of nature scenes (25%). While outdoor contact with nature away from home decreased, participants still found ways to experience the restorative benefits of nature in and around their home. Of special interest in planning interventions was the fact that actual or real nature was preferred over that experienced through technology. This could be an artifact of our sample, or could represent a desire to be in touch with the “real world” during a health crisis. Nature contact may represent a flexible strategy to decrease stress and improve symptom experience among patients with cancer, particularly during public health crises or disruptions to cancer care.","Pearson, Amber L.; Breeze, Victoria; Reuben, Aaron; Wyatt, Gwen",Int J Environ Res Public Health,155,1

Pregnant women are considered to have a higher risk of severe morbidity and even mortality due to their susceptibility to respiratory pathogens and their particular immunologic state. Several studies assessing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection during pregnancy reported adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients with severe conditions, including spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, fetal distress, cesarean section, preterm birth, neonatal asphyxia, neonatal pneumonia, stillbirth, and neonatal death. However, whether these complications are causally related to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is not clear. Here, we reviewed the scientific evidence supporting the contributing role of Treg/Th17 cell imbalance in the uncontrolled systemic inflammation characterizing severe cases of COVID‐19. Based on the recognized harmful effects of these CD4(+) T‐cell subset imbalances in pregnancy, we speculated that SARS‐CoV‐2 infection might lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes through the deregulation of otherwise tightly regulated Treg/Th17 ratios, and to subsequent uncontrolled systemic inflammation. Moreover, we discuss the possibility of vertical transmission of COVID‐19 from infected mothers to their infants, which could also explain adverse perinatal outcomes. Rigorous monitoring of pregnancies and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent and treat early eventual maternal and perinatal complications.","Muyayalo, Kahinho P.; Huang, Dong‐Hui; Zhao, Si‐Jia; Xie, Ting; Mor, Gil; Liao, Ai‐Hua",Am J Reprod Immunol,155,1

Not much is known about the changes in public responses to containment measures from the initial outbreak to resurgence. Monitoring public responses is crucial to inform policy measures to prepare for COVID-19 resurgence. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess and compare public responses to containment measures during the initial outbreak and resurgence of COVID-19 in China. METHODS: We curated all COVID-19–related posts from Sina Weibo (China’s version of Twitter) during the initial outbreak and resurgence of COVID-19 in Beijing, China. With a Python script, we constructed subsets of Weibo posts focusing on 3 containment measures: lockdown, the test-trace-isolate strategy, and suspension of gatherings. The Baidu open-source sentiment analysis model and latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling, a widely used machine learning algorithm, were used to assess public engagement, sentiments, and frequently discussed topics on each containment measure. RESULTS: A total of 8,985,221 Weibo posts were curated. In China, the containment measures evolved from a complete lockdown for the general population during the initial outbreak to a more targeted response strategy for high-risk populations during COVID-19 resurgence. Between the initial outbreak and resurgence, the average daily proportion of Weibo posts with negative sentiments decreased from 57% to 47% for the lockdown, 56% to 51% for the test-trace-isolate strategy, and 55% to 48% for the suspension of gatherings. Among the top 3 frequently discussed topics on lockdown measures, discussions on containment measures accounted for approximately 32% in both periods, but those on the second-most frequently discussed topic shifted from the expression of negative emotions (11%) to its impacts on daily life or work (26%). The public expressed a high level of panic (21%) during the initial outbreak but almost no panic (1%) during resurgence. The more targeted test-trace-isolate measure received the most support (60%) among all 3 containment measures in the initial outbreak, and its support rate approached 90% during resurgence. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the initial outbreak, the public expressed less engagement and less negative sentiments on containment measures and were more supportive toward containment measures during resurgence. Targeted test-trace-isolate strategies were more acceptable to the public. Our results indicate that when COVID-19 resurges, more targeted test-trace-isolate strategies for high-risk populations should be promoted to balance pandemic control and its impact on daily life and the economy.","Zhou, Xinyu; Song, Yi; Jiang, Hao; Wang, Qian; Qu, Zhiqiang; Zhou, Xiaoyu; Jit, Mark; Hou, Zhiyuan; Lin, Leesa",J Med Internet Res,155,24

Compounds 1-3 were sesquiterpenes with new structures which were elucidated based on NMR spectroscopy, high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) data. All the isolates were tested for their stimulation effects on glucose uptake in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, and cellular antioxidant activity. Compounds 9-12 were subjected to molecular docking experiment to primarily evaluate their anti-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) activity. As a result, compounds 9-12 were found to increase the glucose uptake of insulin-resistant HepG2 cells by 18.1%, 62.7%, 33.7% and 21.4% at the dose of 50 µmol·L-1, respectively. Compounds 9-12 also showed good cellular antioxidant activities with CAA50 values of 12.23, 23.11, 5.31 and 16.04 µmol·L-1, respectively. Molecular docking between COVID-19 Mpro and compounds 9-12 indicated potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory activity of these four compounds.

Here, we performed a pilot study to assess the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in samples taken from 491 pre- epidemic individuals, 51 patients from Hopital Bichat (Paris), 209 pauci-symptomatic individuals in the French Oise region and 200 contemporary Oise blood donors. Two in-house ELISA assays, that recognize the full-length nucleoprotein (N) or trimeric Spike (S) ectodomain were implemented. We also developed two novel assays: the S-Flow assay, which is based on the recognition of S at the cell surface by flow-cytometry, and the LIPS assay that recognizes diverse antigens (including S1 or N C- terminal domain) by immunoprecipitation. Overall, the results obtained with the four assays were similar, with differences in sensitivity that can be attributed to the technique and the antigen in use. High antibody titers were associated with neutralisation activity, assessed using infectious SARS-CoV- 2 or lentiviral-S pseudotypes. In hospitalized patients, seroconversion and neutralisation occurred on 5-14 days post symptom onset, confirming previous studies. Seropositivity was detected in 29% of pauci-symptomatic individuals within 15 days post-symptoms and 3 % of blood of healthy donors collected in the area of a cluster of COVID cases. Altogether, our assays allow for a broad evaluation of SARS-CoV2 seroprevalence and antibody profiling in different population subsets.","Grzelak, Ludivine; Temmam, Sarah; Planchais, Cyril; Demeret, Caroline; Huon, Christele; Guivel, Florence; Staropoli, Isabelle; Chazal, Maxime; Dufloo, Jeremy; Planas, Delphine; Buchrieser, Julian; Rajah, Maaran Michael; Robinot, Remy; Porrot, Francoise; Albert, Melanie; Chen, Kuang-Yu; Crescenzo, Bernadette; Donati, Flora; Anna, Francois; Souque, Philippe; Gransagne, Marion; Bellalou, Jacques; Nowakowski, Mireille; Backovic, Marija; Bouadma, lila; Le Fevre, Lucie; Le Hingrat, Quentin; Descamps, Diane; Pourbaix, Anabelle; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Tondeur, Laura; Besombes, Camille; Ungeheuer, Marie-Noelle; Mellon, Guillaume; Morel, Pascal; Rolland, Simon; Rey, Felix; Behillil, Sylvie; Enouf, Vincent; Lemaitre, Audrey; Creach, Marie-Aude; Petres, Stephane; Escriou, Nicolas; Charneau, Pierre; Fontanet, Arnaud; Hoen, Bruno; Bruel, Timothee; Eloit, Marc; Mouquet, Hugo; Schwartz, Olivier; van der Werf, Sylvie",,155,0

The starting hypothesis is that the contagion in urban spaces manifests unevenly in the form of clusters of cases that are generated and developed by neighborhood contagion. Methodologically, the spatial distribution of those infected in the study area, the city of Málaga (Spain), is firstly analyzed from the disaggregated and anonymous address information. After defining the concept of neighborhood contagion focus and justifying its morphological parameters, a method to detect and map neighborhood contagion focus in urban settings is proposed and applied to the study case. As the main results, the existence of focuses and micro-focuses in the spatial pattern of contagion is verified. Focuses are considered as an ideal spatial analysis unit, and the advantages and potentialities of the use of mapping focus as a useful tool for health and territorial management in different phases of the epidemic are shown.","Perles, María-Jesús; Sortino, Juan F.; Mérida, Matías F.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,155,17

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From March 1, 2007, to February 28, 2010, among a surveillance population of 21,420 persons >5 years old in rural western Kenya, we collected blood for culture and malaria smears, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for quantitative real-time PCR for ten viruses and three atypical bacteria, and urine for pneumococcal antigen testing on outpatients and inpatients meeting a ARI case definition (cough or difficulty breathing or chest pain and temperature >38.0°C or oxygen saturation <90% or hospitalization). We also collected swabs from asymptomatic controls, from which we calculated pathogen-attributable fractions, adjusting for age, season, and HIV-status, in logistic regression. We calculated incidence by pathogen, adjusting for health-seeking for ARI and pathogen-attributable fractions. Among 3,406 ARI patients >5 years old (adjusted annual incidence 12.0 per 100 person-years), influenza A virus was the most common virus (22% overall; 11% inpatients, 27% outpatients) and Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacteria (16% overall; 23% inpatients, 14% outpatients), yielding annual incidences of 2.6 and 1.7 episodes per 100 person-years, respectively. Influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus were more prevalent in swabs among cases (22%, 6%, 8% and 5%, respectively) than controls. Adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parechovirus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were not more prevalent among cases than controls. Pneumococcus and non-typhi Salmonella were more prevalent among HIV-infected adults, but prevalence of viruses was similar among HIV-infected and HIV-negative individuals. ARI incidence was highest during peak malaria season. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNFICANCE: Vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus (by potential herd immunity from childhood vaccination or of HIV-infected adults) might prevent much of the substantial ARI incidence among persons >5 years old in similar rural African settings.","Feikin, Daniel R.; Njenga, M.

We offer a new model of action to be easily replicated, particularly during times of crisis, with aims to impact change locally and beyond the therapeutic space. METHOD: The D.C. Psychological Association (DCPA) actively responded to the double pandemics of COVID-19. Using a posthoc qualitative analysis four steps were identified: organizing, providing support and education, and engaging in advocacy (O-SEA Approach), which all centered the specific skill set of psychologists and psychologists-in-training. RESULTS: Measures of success included the following: increased membership and engagement of members, development of relevant programming to providers and the community, community attendance of events, statements indicating knowledge gained by providers, new connections with local organizations and officials, and local legislative change. CONCLUSIONS: The O-SEA Approach provides a framework for local advocacy that can empower psychologists to contribute their expertise in tangible and impactful ways. This model seeks justice for all people through elevating the voices of the unjustly marginalized, providing support and education to mental health providers and the community, and advocating for policy that is grounded in culturally relevant research. The O-SEA Approach can be successful in these aspirations and be applied in communities across the nation. Clinical Impact Statement: The permanence of racism in the United States is evident throughout history when examining America's social, economic, and political systems. Racism's reverberations are present locally, in the nation's capital, through its policing techniques and gentrification, among other insidious manifestations. COVID-19's global impact has been reported to have particularly deleterious effects on Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) through impacting housing, food, and income security while simultaneously underscoring the lack of access to health resources. This demanded a response by mental health professionals. Consequently, the D.C. Psychological Association made efforts to organize, support, educate, and advocate for the local community through what is called the O-SEA Approach.

We assessed influenza surveillance sustainability in Africa where influenza activity varies and external funds for surveillance have decreased. METHODS: We surveyed African Network for Influenza Surveillance and Epidemiology (ANISE) countries about 2011‐2017 surveillance system characteristics. Data were summarized with descriptive statistics and analyzed with univariate and multivariable analyses to quantify sustained or expanded influenza surveillance capacity in Africa. RESULTS: Eighteen (75%) of 24 ANISE members participated in the survey; their cumulative population of 710 751 471 represent 56% of Africa's total population. All 18 countries scored a mean 95% on WHO laboratory quality assurance panels. The number of samples collected from severe acute respiratory infection case‐patients remained consistent between 2011 and 2017 (13 823 vs 13 674 respectively) but decreased by 12% for influenza‐like illness case‐patients (16 210 vs 14 477). Nine (50%) gained capacity to lineage‐type influenza B. The number of countries reporting each week to WHO FluNet increased from 15 (83%) in 2011 to 17 (94%) in 2017. CONCLUSIONS: Despite declines in external surveillance funding, ANISE countries gained additional laboratory testing capacity and continued influenza testing and reporting to WHO. These gains represent important achievements toward sustainable surveillance and epidemic/pandemic preparedness.","Igboh, Ledor S.; McMorrow, Meredith; Tempia, Stefano; Emukule, Gideon O.; Talla Nzussouo, Ndahwouh; McCarron, Margaret; Williams, Thelma; Weatherspoon, Vashonia; Moen, Ann; Fawzi, Derrar; Njouom, Richard; Nakoune, Emmanuel; Dauoda, Coulibaly; Kavunga‐Membo, Hugo; Okeyo, Mary; Heraud, Jean‐Michel; Mambule, Ivan Kiggundu; Sow, Samba Ousmane; Tivane, Almiro; Lagare, Adamou; Adebayo, Adedeji; Dia, Ndongo; Mmbaga, Vida; Maman, Issaka; Lutwama, Julius; Simusika, Paul; Walaza, Sibongile; Mangtani, Punam; Nguipdop‐Djomo, Patrick; Cohen, Cheryl; Azziz‐Baumgartner, Eduardo",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,155,15

OBJECTIVE: We attempt to better understand the relationship of QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients in this study. METHODS: This is a retrospective, hospital-based, observational study. All patients with normal baseline QTc interval who were hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection at two hospitals in Ohio, USA were included in this study. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients had QTc prolongation, and 210 patients continued to have normal QTc during hospitalization. The baseline QTc intervals were comparable in the two groups. Patients with QTc prolongation were older (mean age 67 vs. 60, P 0.003), more likely to have underlying cardiovascular disease (48% versus 26%, P 0.001), ischemic heart disease (29% versus 17%, P 0.026), congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (16% versus 8%, P 0.042), chronic kidney disease (23% versus 10%, P 0.005), and end-stage renal disease (12% versus 1%, P < 0.001). Patients with QTc prolongation were more likely to have received hydroxychloroquine (75% versus 59%, P 0.018), azithromycin (18% vs. 14%, P 0.034), a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (29% vs 7%, P < 0.001), more than 1 QT prolonging agents (59% vs. 32%, P < 0.001). Patients who were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) were less likely to develop QTc prolongation (11% versus 26%, P 0.014). QTc prolongation was not associated with increased ventricular arrhythmias or mortality. CONCLUSION: Older age, ESRD, underlying cardiovascular disease, potential virus mediated cardiac injury, and drugs like hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin, contribute to QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients. The role of ACEi in preventing QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients needs to be studied further.","Changal, Khalid; Paternite, David; Mack, Sean; Veria, Spiro; Bashir, Rehana; Patel, Mitra; Soni, Ronak; Ali, Muhammad; Mir, Tanveer; Sheikh, Mujeeb; Ramanathan, P.

This lockdown represented the largest quarantine in the history of public health and provides us with an opportunity to critically examine the relationship between a city lockdown on human mobility and controlling the spread of a viral epidemic, in this case COVID-19. This study aims to assess the causal impact of the Wuhan lockdown on population movement and the increase of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases. METHODS: Based on the daily panel data from 279 Chinese cities, our research is the first to apply the synthetic control approach to empirically analyze the causal relationship between the Wuhan lockdown of its population mobility and the progression of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases. By using a weighted average of available control cities to reproduce the counterfactual outcome trajectory that the treated city would have experienced in the absence of the lockdown, the synthetic control approach overcomes the sample selection bias and policy endogeneity problems that can arise from previous empirical methods in selecting control units. RESULTS: In our example, the lockdown of Wuhan reduced mobility inflow by approximately 60 % and outflow by about 50 %. A significant reduction of new cases was observed within four days of the lockdown. The increase in new cases declined by around 50% during this period. However, the suppression effect became less discernible after this initial period of time. A 2.25-fold surge was found for the increase in new cases on the fifth day following the lockdown, after which it died down rapidly. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided urgently needed and reliable causal evidence that city lockdown can be an effective short-term tool in containing and delaying the spread of a viral epidemic. Further, the city lockdown strategy can buy time during which countries can mobilize an effective response in order to better prepare. Therefore, in spite of initial widespread skepticism, lockdowns are likely to be added to the response toolkit used for any future pandemic outbreak.","Yang, Xiaoxuan",Glob Health Res Policy,155,16

Most of the deceased patients had pre-existing comorbidities; over 20% had chronic kidney disease (CKD). Furthermore, although SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized mainly by diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (AKI) has developed in a high percentage of cases. As AKI has been shown to be associated with worse prognosis, we believe that the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the kidney should be investigated. This review sets out to describe the main renal aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the role of the virus in the development and progression of kidney damage. In this article, attention is focused on the epidemiology, etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms of kidney damage, histopathology, clinical features in nephropathic patients (CKD, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, AKI, transplantation) and prevention and containment strategies. Although there remains much more to be learned with regards to this disease, nonetheless it is our hope that this review will aid in the understanding and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gagliardi, Ida; Patella, Gemma; Michael, Ashour; Serra, Raffaele; Provenzano, Michele; Andreucci, Michele",J Clin Med,155,20

However, opinions diverge on the question whether those ‘great efforts’ towards sustainability require systemic changes or merely systematic ones. Drawing upon Brand and Wissen’s concept of “imperial modes of living” (Rev Int Polit Econ 20:687–711, 2013; The imperial mode of living: everyday life and the ecological crisis of capitalism, Verso, London/New York, 2021), we ask whether the lively debates about sustainability and ‘ethical’ consumption among producers and consumers in Germany are far reaching enough to sufficiently reduce the imperial weight on the environment and other human and nonhuman animals. By combining discourse analysis of agri-food businesses’ sustainability reports with narrative consumer interviews, we examine understandings of sustainability in discourses concerning responsible food provision and shed light on how those discourses are inscribed in consumers’ everyday food practices. We adopt Ehgartner’s discursive frames of ‘consumer sovereignty’, ‘economic rationality’, and ‘stewardship’ to illustrate our findings, and add a fourth one of ‘legitimacy’. Constituting the conditions under which food-related themes become sustainability issues, these frames help businesses to (1) individualise the responsibility to enact changes, (2) tie efforts towards sustainability to financial profits, (3) subject people and nature to the combination of care and control, and (4) convey legitimacy through scientific authority. We discuss how these frames, mirrored in some consumer narratives, work to sideline deeper engagement with ecological sustainability and social justice, and how they brush aside the desires of some ostensibly ‘sovereign’ consumers to overcome imperial modes of food provision through much more far reaching, systemic changes. Finally, we reflect on possible paths towards a de-imperialised food system.","Hirth, Steffen; Bürstmayr, Theresa; Strüver, Anke",Agric Human Values,155,4

However, these fields differ vastly in female representation: women tend to be most strongly underrepresented in technological and computer science university majors and to a lesser extent in mathematics and chemistry, while they are less underrepresented in biological sciences. To understand this variability, we examine how girls in the process of making higher education choices compare different STEM-fields to each other. We draw upon dimensional comparison theory, which argues that educational motivation involves intra-individual comparisons of achievement across school subjects. However, previous research has shown that a focus on achievement in STEM is not enough, anticipated belonging in a STEM-field plays a pivotal role in interest in pursuing that field. Consistent with this, we examined participants’ comparisons of anticipated belonging across STEM-fields. A sample of 343 high school girls in STEM-focused university tracks completed a survey on their anticipated belonging and interest in pursuing different STEM majors. Latent Profile Analysis resulted in 3 profiles, showing different belonging comparison patterns across STEM-fields. Examining these comparisons—both within and across profiles—showed how girls felt pushed away from certain STEM-fields and pulled toward others. The findings suggest that for interest in pursuing specific STEM-fields it is not just about the level of anticipated belonging within that STEM-field, but just as much about the level of anticipated belonging in comparison to another STEM-field.

This study investigated changes in physical activity, dietary behaviors, and well-being during the early period of this policy. METHODS: A cohort of young people aged 13–19 years from Sydney (N = 582) were prospectively followed for 22 weeks (November 18, 2019, to April 19, 2020). Daily, weekly, and monthly trajectories of diet, physical activity, sedentary behavior, well-being, and psychological distress were collected via smartphone, using a series of ecological momentary assessments and smartphone sensors. Differences in health and well-being outcomes were compared pre- and post-implementation of physical distancing guidelines. RESULTS: After the implementation of physical distancing measures in NSW, there were significant decreases in physical activity (odds ratio [OR] = .53, 95% confidence interval [CI] = .34–.83), increases in social media and Internet use (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.15–3.00), and increased screen time based on participants' smartphone screen state. Physical distancing measures were also associated with being alone in the previous hour (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.33–3.28), decreases in happiness (OR = .38, 95% CI = .18–.82), and fast food consumption (OR = .46, 95% CI = .29–.73). CONCLUSIONS: Physical distancing and social restrictions had a contemporaneous impact on health and well-being outcomes associated with chronic disease among young people. As the pandemic evolves, it will be important to consider how to mitigate against any longer term health impacts of physical distancing restrictions.","Munasinghe, Sithum; Sperandei, Sandro; Freebairn, Louise; Conroy, Elizabeth; Jani, Hir; Marjanovic, Sandra; Page, Andrew",J Adolesc Health,155,11

The roles of CD4(+) T cells in MS have been clarified by either “loss-of-function” or “gain-of-function” methods, which have been carried out mainly in autoimmune and viral models of MS: experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus infection, respectively. Observations in MS patients were consistent with the mechanisms found in the MS models, that is, increased pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 activity is associated with disease exacerbation, while anti-inflammatory Th2 cells and Tregs appear to play a protective role.","Sato, Fumitaka; Omura, Seiichi; Jaffe, S.L.; Tsunoda, Ikuo",Multiple Sclerosis,155,32

With 17% of the world’s population, India has so far had 13% of global COVID-19 infections and 8.5% of deaths. Maharashtra accounting for 9% of India’s population, is the worst affected state, with 19% of infections and 33% of total deaths in the country until 23rd December 2020. Though a number of studies have examined the vulnerability to and spread of COVID-19 and its effect on mortality, no attempt has been made to understand its impact on mortality in the states of India. METHOD: Using data from multiple sources and under the assumption that COVID-19 deaths are additional deaths in the population, this paper examined the impact of the disease on premature mortality, loss of life expectancy, years of potential life lost (YPLL), and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) in Maharashtra. Descriptive statistics, a set of abridged life tables, YPLL, and DALY were used in the analysis. Estimates of mortality indices were compared pre- and during COVID-19. RESULT: COVID-19 attributable deaths account for 5.3% of total deaths in the state and have reduced the life expectancy at birth by 0.8 years, from 73.2 years in the pre-COVID-19 period to 72.4 years by the end of 2020. If COVID-19 attributable deaths increase to 10% of total deaths, life expectancy at birth will likely reduce by 1.4 years. The probability of death in 20–64 years of age (the prime working-age group) has increased from 0.15 to 0.16 due to COVID-19. There has been 1.06 million additional loss of years (YPLL) in the state, and DALY due to COVID-19 has been estimated to be 6 per thousand. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has increased premature mortality, YPLL, and DALY and has reduced life expectancy at every age in Maharashtra.

The substrate specificity was examined using the natural substrate bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) and/or synthetic substrates p-nitrophenylacetate (p-NiA) and α-naphthylacetate (α-NA) and compared with several strains of MHV and influenza viruses. The AE of DVIM hydrolyzed the O-acetylester bond of BSM, and the two synthetic substrates p-NiA and α-NA in vitro. MHV-S reacted efficiently with both p-NiA and α-NA but less with BSM. Influenza virus (C/Miyagi/77) reacted with BSM efficiently, however reacted with p-NiA weakly, but not with α-NA at all. Thus, the AE-reactivity of DVIM was distinctly different from that of MHV-S and influenza C virus, suggesting that the AE of HE may have a modified function. Isolation of HE by the treatment with non ionic detergent NP40, resulted in globules approximately 5 nm in diameter. DVIM-binding proteins were demonstrated in the plasma membrane of mouse intestinal brush-border cells and hepatocytes. The same protein was recognized by MHV-S and MHV-4. The cell membranes obtained from these target tissues were substrates for the AE of DVIM. The biological importance of the HE protein for DVIM is discussed.","Sugiyama, K.; Kasai, M.; Kato, S.; Kasai, H.; Hatakeyama, K.",Arch Virol,155,20

METHODS: This retrospective observation study is comprised of seven patients who presented with MEWDS in a 3-month period in central Israel. Data were collected from patients' medical records on clinical, multimodal imaging, and viral serology findings. RESULTS: Six women and one man of mean age 31.5 ± 7.2 years. Three reported a precedent viral infection. All had unilateral decreased vision. Funduscopy revealed foveal granularity. MAIN IMAGING FINDINGS: Hyperfluorescent spots on blue autofluorescence (BAF), hypofluorescent spots on indocyanine green angiography, dark lesions on infrared photos, and ellipsoid zone irregularities on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Resolution of the spots on BAF correlated with anatomic (SD-OCT) and visual recovery. OCT angiography performed following the convalescence stage demonstrated intact retinal and choroidal flow. Serologic findings were inconclusive. CONCLUSION: We report a unique cluster of MEWDS patients presented in a short period of time. SD-OCT findings of ellipsoid zone disruption in combination with other multimodal imaging modalities are outlined meticulously. Recognizing these imaging features along with high index of clinical suspicion is important for the diagnosis of MEWDS.

We aimed to assess patients’ perception regarding risks of COVID-19 with GI endoscopy and the changes in the endoscopy unit as a result of the ongoing pandemic. METHODS: Outpatients undergoing GI endoscopy at our institution were categorized into those scheduled to undergo GI endoscopy (pre-procedure) and those who had recently undergone GI endoscopy during the pandemic (post-procedure). Two separate but similar survey instruments were designed. Patients were asked to respond on a 5-point Likert scale. Responses were stratified as ‘low’, ‘neutral’ and ‘high’ for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 150 and 355 respondents completed the pre-procedure and post-procedure surveys, with a combined response rate of 82.5%. Non-white ethnicity was associated with reporting a ‘high’ level of concern for endoscopy related COVID-19 exposure in both the pre-procedure (OR 4.09, 95% CI 1.54-10.82) and post-procedure cohorts (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.04-4.29). 42% of patients in the pre-procedure cohort and 11.8% in the post-procedure cohort reported their level of concern for COVID exposure as ‘high’. Among the post-procedure cohort, 88% of the patients were likely to undergo repeat endoscopy during the pandemic if recommended. CONCLUSION: Patients are willing to undergo GI endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-white and older patients, and those undergoing screening examinations were more concerned with the GI endoscopy related COVID-19 transmission risk.","Taneja, Vikas; El-Dallal, Mohammed; Bilal, Mohammad; Flier, Sarah N.; Sheth, Sunil G.; Ballou, Sarah K.; Berzin, Tyler M.; Pleskow, Douglas K.; Feuerstein, Joseph D.; Sawhney, Mandeep S.",Tech Innov Gastrointest Endosc,155,16

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate factors influencing preventive behavior against MERS-CoV among Korean nursing students. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study using a questionnaire survey. Data were collected from 429 nursing students from three colleges of nursing in Korea from June 25 to July 3 in 2015. RESULTS: Preventive behavior against MERS-CoV was affected mostly by attitude (β = .243, p < .001). Such behavior was also high in relation to the variables of perceived risk (β = .232, p < .001), older students (β = .202, p < .001), knowledge level (β = .153, p < .01), and female respondents (β = .115, p < .05). CONCLUSION: Preventive behavior against emerging infectious diseases such as MERS-CoV was found to be affected most significantly by attitude and risk perception.

We included children 0-17.99 years presenting for a bicycle-related injury. We compared absolute visit counts of bike injuries per month, demographics, triage acuity, injury type and disposition. RESULTS A total of 1215 bike-related visits were analysed. There were 234 presentations in 2018 (March to October), 305 in 2019, and 676 in 2020. Overall, the mean age was 9.5 years (standard deviation 5.5-13.5), there were 67% males, median Canadian Emergency Department Triage and Acuity Scale score was 3 (interquartile range 3-4) and the most common injuries were fractures (n = 471, 38.8%).

We aim to report three polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 patients who developed pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax unrelated to mechanical ventilation. We originally analyzed 800 patients with COVID-19 disease at Orlando Regional Medical Center from March 1, 2020, to July 31, 2020, of which 12 patients developed pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax in their hospital course.

Structural racism contributes to a disproportionate burden of homelessness among people of color. PEH experience not only significant medical concerns but also complex social needs that need to be addressed concurrently for effective healing, issues that have been magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. As health disparities and structural racism intersect among PEH, it is critically important to develop PEH-centered interventions to improve care and health outcomes as part of an effort to dismantle racism. One opportunity to address these disparities in care for PEH is through training ED physicians on methods for identifying and intervening on the unique needs of vulnerable patient groups. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has outlined health quality pathways in the clinical learning environment to address health disparities. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is particularly well suited for this scenario as it allows experiential learning for trainees to work with and understand a diverse group of stakeholders, to deepen their knowledge of local health disparities, and to lead research and measure outcomes of interventions to tackle health disparities. In this paper, we highlight the utility of CBPR in fostering experiential learning for EM residents on tackling health disparities and the importance of community collaboration in trainee-led interventions for comprehensive ED care.","Ryus, Caitlin R; Yang, David; Tsai, Jennifer; Meldrum, Jonathan; Ngaruiya, Christine",AEM education and training,155,16

In addition, both drugs are currently used off-label in hospitals worldwide and in numerous clinical trials for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, CQ and HCQ use has been associated with cardiac side effects, which is of concern due to the higher risk of COVID-19 complications in patients with heart related disorders, and increased mortality associated with COVID-19 cardiac complications. In this study we analyzed over thirteen million adverse event reports form the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System to confirm and quantify the association of cardiac side effects of CQ and HCQ. Additionally, we identified several confounding factors, including male sex, NSAID coadministration, advanced age, and prior diagnoses contributing to the risk of drug related cardiotoxicity.

Here, we report the impact of COVID-19 on the management of HCC patients in a large tertiary care hospital. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of HCC patients who presented at the Vienna General Hospital, between 01/DEC/2019 and 30/JUN/2020. We compared patient care before (period 1) and after (period 2) implementation of COVID-19-associated healthcare restrictions on 16/MAR/2020. RESULTS: Of 126 patients, majority was male (n = 104, 83%) with a mean age of 66±11 years. Half of patients (n = 57, 45%) had impaired liver function (Child-Pugh stage B/C) and 91 (72%) had intermediate-advanced stage HCC (BCLC B-D). New treatment, was initiated in 68 (54%) patients. Number of new HCC diagnoses did not differ between the two periods (n = 14 vs. 14). While personal visits were reduced, an increase in teleconsultation was observed (period 2). Number of patients with visit delays (n = 31 (30%) vs. n = 10 (10%); p = 0.001) and imaging delays (n = 25 (25%) vs. n = 7 (7%); p = 0.001) was higher in period 2. Accordingly, a reduced number of patients was discussed in interdisciplinary tumor boards (lowest number in April (n = 24), compared to a median number of 57 patients during period 1). Median number of elective/non-elective admissions was not different between the periods. One patient contracted COVID-19 with lethal outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in patient care included reduced personal contacts but increased telephone visits, and delays in diagnostic procedures. The effects on long-term outcome need to be determined.","Pomej, Katharina; Scheiner, Bernhard; Hartl, Lukas; Balcar, Lorenz; Meischl, Tobias; Mandorfer, Mattias; Reiberger, Thomas; Müller, Christian; Trauner, Michael; Pinter, Matthias",PLoS One,155,11

This paper reports on an unusual out-of-season cyanoHAB and its dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic, in Lake Avernus, South Italy. Fast detection strategy (FDS) was used to assess this phenomenon, through the integration of satellite imagery and biomolecular investigation of the environmental samples. Data obtained unveiled a widespread Microcystis sp. bloom in February 2020 (i.e., winter season in Italy), which completely disappeared at the end of the following COVID-19 lockdown, when almost all urban activities were suspended. Due to potential harmfulness of cyanoHABs, crude extracts from the “winter bloom” were evaluated for their cytotoxicity in two different human cell lines, namely normal dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) and breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7). The chloroform extract was shown to exert the highest cytotoxic activity, which has been correlated to the presence of cyanotoxins, i.e., microcystins, micropeptins, anabaenopeptins, and aeruginopeptins, detected by molecular networking analysis of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data.","Teta, Roberta; Sala, Gerardo Della; Esposito, Germana; Stornaiuolo, Mariano; Scarpato, Silvia; Casazza, Marco; Anastasio, Aniello; Lega, Massimiliano; Costantino, Valeria",Toxins (Basel),155,33

The data showing the role of frailty in patients infected with COVID-19 is needed. METHODS: This was a nationwide cohort study conducted at all hospitals in Turkey. All COVID-19 hospitalized patients (≥ 65 years) were included. Patients who were alive and not discharged up to July 20, 2020, were excluded. The frailty was assessed by using the “Hospital Frailty Risk Score” (HFRS). Patients were classified into three risk groups of frailty based on previously validated cut points as low (<5 points), intermediate (5-15 points), and high (>15 points). Additionally, patients who had the HFRS of ≥5 were defined as frail. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality rates by frailty group. RESULTS: Between March 11, 2020, and June 22, 2020, a total of 18,234 COVID-19 patients from all of 81 provinces of Turkey were included. Totally, 12,295 (67.4%) patients were defined as frail (HFRS of >5) of which 2,801 (15.4%) patients were categorized in the highest level of frailty (HFRS of >15). Observed in-hospital mortality rates were 697 (12.0%), 1,751 (18.2%) and 867 (31.0%) in low, intermediate and high hospital frailty risk, respectively (p<0.001). Compared with low HFRS (<5), the adjusted odds ratios for in-hospital mortality were 1.482 (1.334-1.646) for intermediate HFRS (5-15) and 2.084; 95% CI, 1.799-2.413 for high HFRS (>15). CONCLUSIONS: As a claims-based frailty model, the HFRS provides clinicians and health systems, a standardized tool for an effective detection and grading of frailty in patients in COVID-19. A frailty-based tailored management of the older population may provide a more accurate risk categorization for both therapeutic and preventive strategies.","Kundi, Harun; Çetin, Elif Hande Özcan; Canpolat, Uğur; Aras, Sevgi; Celik, Osman; Ata, Naim; Birinci, Suayip; Çay, Serkan; Özeke, Özcan; Tanboğa, Ibrahim Halil; Topaloğlu, Serkan",J Infect,155,24

Exploring factors that determine whether people adopt social distancing measures is, therefore, critical to reducing the spread of the virus. This study aimed to investigate people’s intentions to socially distance based on the extended Theory of Planned Behavior. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to the sample population and collected through social media online and WhatsApp groups from March 26, 2020 to March 29, 2020. There were 823 analyzed out of 1870 responses. The extended TPB variables and risk perception were measured using a 7-point scale (scored from 1 to 7). Data were analyzed using the partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modeling method. RESULTS: Study found that the factors influencing the intention to perform social distancing were subjective norms and perceived behavior control. Risk perception affected attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Media exposure was found to determine attitudes, subjective norms, and risk perceptions. The relationship between attitudes and intentions, and media use and perceived behavior control were not significant. The better and effective risk communication that can change the level of risk perception, raise family and religious leader as well as increase to control behavior are the keys to people’s perform social distancing. Results from a multigroup analysis revealed that younger individuals showed a stronger relationship between the influence of risk perception and PBC and media use on risk perception. The predictive strength of subjective norms from risk perception and risk perception from media use was more strongly associated with rural populations. CONCLUSIONS: The results of study provide an initial understanding of the level of the public’s risk perception to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Findings also revealed the role of media use in determining risk perception, attitudes and subjective norms and, in turn, change people’s intention to socially distance. This study may add to the literature of behavioral changes in pandemic and provide a framework for both policymakers and practitioners to formulate effective interventions in the future.

Since the Senet Group’s dissolution in 2020, the campaign has been overseen by the Betting and Gambling Council (BGC), the main gambling industry trade body. There has been no prior analysis of the activities, ideas and framing adopted by the Senet Group, who claimed to be acting as an industry ‘watchdog’ and oversaw what they characterised as a major public education campaign. We collated written and image-based material related to the Senet Group and its When the Fun Stops, Stop campaign from multiple sources. Guided by Entman’s four functions of framing, we analysed the Senet Group’s framing of the issues it sought to address, particularly harmful gambling, as well as its causes, and the solutions, focusing on the group’s main activity: the delivery of the When the Fun Stops, Stop campaign. We also critically appraised an evaluation of the campaign funded by the Senet Group, using the findings to interrogate the stated claims about the campaign’s effectiveness. The analysis showed that the Senet Group’s framing of the problem, its causes, and proposed responses resemble those adopted by other industries and industry-funded groups. This involves portraying any harms caused by their products as limited to an atypical minority, rejecting upstream determinants of harm, and promoting individually-targeted voluntary measures, all contrary to the evidence of what works in health promotion, and what would characterise a public health approach. Neither the existing evidence base nor the evidence presented by the Senet Group support their claims about the campaign’s effectiveness. These findings add to concerns about industry-funded campaigns in other areas. To minimise conflicts of interest, interventions intended to address gambling-related harms, such as public education campaigns, should be evidence-based and developed, implemented and evaluated completely independent of the industry and industry-funded organisations.","van Schalkwyk, May CI; Maani, Nason; McKee, Martin; Thomas, Samantha; Knai, Cécile; Petticrew, Mark",PLoS One,155,10

Although significant progress has been made in the control and therapy of mastitis, the frequency of this disease continues to be high in livestock herds, having a negative influence on productive parameters and implicitly on economic indices in dairy farms. The opportunity to address this problem resides in the fact that a countries’ share of the community market will only be maintained by increasing milk quality. It is imperative for cattle farmers, milk producers and national economies to obtain milk according to EU standards, in order for it to be valued at advantageous, competitive prices. This objective may be achieved by keeping the incidence of mastitis under very strict control, using novel treatment options. ABSTRACT: Nanomaterials have been used for diagnosis and therapy in the human medical field, while their application in veterinary medicine and animal production is still relatively new. Nanotechnology, however, is a rapidly growing field, offering the possibility of manufacturing new materials at the nanoscale level, with the formidable potential to revolutionize the agri-food sector by offering novel treatment options for prevalent and expensive illnesses such as bovine mastitis. Since current treatments are becoming progressively more ineffective in resistant bacteria, the development of innovative products based on both nanotechnology and phytotherapy may directly address a major global problem, antimicrobial resistance, while providing a sustainable animal health solution that supports the production of safe and high-quality food products. This review summarizes the challenges encountered presently in the treatment of bovine mastitis, emphasizing the possibility of using new-generation nanomaterials (e.g., biological synthesized nanoparticles and graphene) and essential oils, as candidates for developing novel treatment options for bovine mastitis.","Neculai-Valeanu, Andra Sabina; Ariton, Adina Mirela; Mădescu, Bianca Maria; Rîmbu, Cristina Mihaela; Creangă, Şteofil",Animals (Basel),155,28

An online retrospective survey was distributed to Rouen-Normandy University students at the end of the COVID-19 lockdown (13th March–11th May 2020). Voluntary university students were included. Data collected were on socio-demographics, academic environment, COVID19 concerns, tobacco smoking, binge drinking, cannabis use, and physical activity in the periods before and during COVID-19 lockdown. The survey was completed by 3671 university students (mean age 20.9 ± 2.47 years, 72.9% female). Significantly favorable changes between the periods before and during COVID-19 were reported for tobacco smoking (18.5% vs. 14.8%), binge drinking (35.9% vs. 9.3%) and cannabis use (5.6% vs. 3.2%) and unfavorable changes for moderate (79.4% vs. 67.9%) and vigorous physical activity (62.5% vs. 59.1%). After logistic regression, factors associated with unfavorable changes in tobacco smoking and with favorable changes in vigorous physical activity were the worry of not validating the academic year and stress related to changes in the mode of teaching, respectively. For each health behavior, unfavorable changes were associated with higher depression levels, and male gender. Then as a decrease, mainly in binge drinking was observed during the COVID-19 lockdown, care must be taken to prevent university students from resuming binge drinking after the end of the lockdown. Health-promotion strategies directed at adopting or maintaining positive mental health and promoting physical activity should be developed for university students to better manage future lockdown periods.","Tavolacci, Marie Pierre; Wouters, Edwin; Van de Velde, Sarah; Buffel, Veerle; Déchelotte, Pierre; Van Hal, Guido; Ladner, Joel",Int J Environ Res Public Health,155,7

The aim of this article is to argue that Camus’s sense of cyclicality related to the recurrence of crises is particularly important for existential management. This idea is embodied primarily by Camus’s famous retelling of the myth of Sisyphus, which is not only a provocative metaphor of his thoughts, as discussed by many authors, but is also an inspiring expression of the idea of ​​revolt, which is further developed in Camus’s later work. The article focuses on recent updates to Camus’s Sisyphean revolt in existentially oriented approaches to management. These are mainly the concepts of the existential manager, an analysis of managerial lived experience within existential hermeneutic phenomenology, and the perspective of an absurd organization. Camus’s motif of cyclicality represents a stimulating framework for analysing lived managerial experience, which is characterized by alternating phases of success and failure. The article also draws attention to other important motives in Camus’s work, such as avoiding extremes and idealistic constructs, and expressing the value of human life as a basis for ethical behaviour. All the mentioned motives are closely related to the concept of revolt. This article also provides several explanatory comments on the editorial, which help to take a closer look at Camus’s style of thinking and avoid possible misinterpretations. In this respect, the distinction between Camus’s approach and forms of existentialism is particularly important.","Müller, Michal",Philos Manag,155,8

This paper examines the factors that influenced local governments' e-disclosure during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. To accomplish this objective, we systematically tracked every post published by the official Facebook page of 304 Portuguese municipalities between March 2 and July 5, 2020. The findings show that financial autonomy is the main predictor of e-disclosure, factors varied on the different phases of the pandemic's first wave, and sociodemographic factors became more prevalent as explanatory factors when the crisis worsened. Our study may help increase the level of preparedness during possible future crises. In particular, establishing communication strategies for prolonged public health crises, making financial resources available for the accomplishment of such strategies, and reducing the digital divide can contribute to more effective disclosure. Future research should explore the dynamics of disclosure during public health crises. This study also highlights the need to incorporate time in research that focuses on the determinants of e-disclosure that could also be tested in normal times.","Padeiro, Miguel; Bueno-Larraz, Beatriz; Freitas, Ângela",Government Information Quarterly,155,28

Repressors and activators of the ACE2 and FURIN genes were identified based on the analyses of gene silencing and overexpression experiments as well as relevant transgenic mouse models. Panels of repressors (VDR; GATA5; SFTPC; HIF1a) and activators (HMGA2; INSIG1; RUNX1; HNF4a; JNK1/c-FOS) were then employed to identify existing drugs manifesting in their effects on gene expression signatures of potential coronavirus infection mitigation agents. Using this strategy, vitamin D and quercetin have been identified as putative 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) mitigation agents. Quercetin has been identified as one of top-scoring candidate therapeutics in the supercomputer SUMMIT drug-docking screen and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) of expression profiling experiments (EPEs), indicating that highly structurally similar quercetin, luteolin, and eriodictyol could serve as scaffolds for the development of efficient inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In agreement with this notion, quercetin alters the expression of 98 of 332 (30%) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2, thus potentially interfering with functions of 23 of 27 (85%) of the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in human cells. Similarly, Vitamin D may interfere with functions of 19 of 27 (70%) of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins by altering expression of 84 of 332 (25%) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the potential effects of both quercetin and vitamin D, the inference could be made that functions of 25 of 27 (93%) of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells may be altered. GSEA and EPEs identify multiple drugs, smoking, and many disease conditions that appear to act as putative coronavirus infection-promoting agents. Discordant patterns of testosterone versus estradiol impacts on SARS-CoV-2 targets suggest a plausible molecular explanation of the apparently higher male mortality during the coronavirus pandemic. Estradiol, in contrast with testosterone, affects the expression of the majority of human genes (203 of 332; 61%) encoding SARS-CoV-2 targets, thus potentially interfering with functions of 26 of 27 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. A hypothetical tripartite combination consisting of quercetin/vitamin D/estradiol may affect expression of 244 of 332 (73%) human genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 targets. Of major concern is the ACE2 and FURIN expression in many human cells and tissues, including immune cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may infect a broad range of cellular targets in the human body. Infection of immune cells may cause immunosuppression, long-term persistence of the virus, and spread of the virus to secondary targets. Present analyses and numerous observational studies indicate that age-associated vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the high mortality of older adults and the elderly. Immediate availability for targeted experimental and clinical interrogations of potential COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents, namely vitamin D and quercetin, as well as of the highly selective (Ki, 600 pm) intrinsically specific FURIN inhibitor (a1-antitrypsin Portland (a1-PDX), is considered an encouraging factor. Observations reported in this contribution are intended to facilitate follow-up targeted experimental studies and, if warranted, randomized clinical trials to identify and validate therapeutically viable interventions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, gene expression profiles of vitamin D and quercetin activities and their established safety records as over-the-counter medicinal substances strongly argue that they may represent viable candidates for further considerations of their potential utility as COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents. In line with the results of present analyses, a randomized interventional clinical trial evaluating effects of estradiol on severity of the coronavirus infection in COVID19+ and presumptive COVID19+ patients and two interventional randomized clinical trials evaluating effects of vitamin D on prevention and treatment of COVID-19 were listed on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.","Glinsky, Gennadi V.",Biomedicines,155,1

However, the regenerative capacities of trophoblasts for application in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering are poorly understood. Here, we aim to determine the skin regeneration and anti-aging capacities of trophoblast-derived conditioned medium (TB-CM) and exosomes (TB-Exos) using human normal dermal fibroblasts (HNDFs). TB-CM and TB-Exos treatments significantly elevated the migration and proliferation potencies of HNDF cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. When RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to investigate the mechanism underlying TB-CM-induced cell migration on scratch-wounded HNDFs, the increased expression of genes associated with C-X-C motif ligand (CXCL) chemokines, toll-like receptors, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling was observed. Furthermore, treatment of intrinsically/extrinsically senescent HNDFs with TB-CM resulted in an enhanced rejuvenation of HNDFs via both protection and restoration processes. Gene expression of extracellular matrix components in the skin dermis significantly increased in TB-CM- and TB-Exos-treated HNDFs. These components are involved in the TB-CM and Exo-mediated regeneration and anti-aging of HNDFs. Thus, this study demonstrated the regenerative and anti-aging efficacies of trophoblast-derived secretomes, suggesting their potential for use in interventions for skin protection and treatment.","Go, Yoon Young; Lee, Chan Mi; Ju, Won Min; Chae, Sung-Won; Song, Jae-Jun",Int J Mol Sci,155,20

The VAR was designed to reduce critical errors in soccer referees’ decision-making (DM), thereby increasing the social perceptions of justice. From the referees’ perspective, the implementation of the VAR represents a technical–technological career change-event. This case study adopted an intrinsic mixed-methods methodology to investigate the implementation of the VAR system within the Israeli Premier League context. The results indicated that the initial VAR performance rates of the Israeli referees were not high compared with data from other countries (e.g., Italy). The Israeli referees perceived the VAR implementation as a moderate change-event in their careers. The largest effects were in pre-match preparation, players’ management, public perception, and DM. The referees felt that their perceived pressure during the matches decreased. This change-event produced off-field demands mostly related to the educational process and on-field demands mainly related to developing VAR proficiency. The referees also experienced off-field (e.g., lack of clear goals and rewards system) and on-field barriers (e.g., errors of the VARs). To effectively cope with these new demands and barriers, most of them initially consulted with others and then made a decision to apply all necessary adjustments in response to the new situation. They also received considerable support yet perceived their cooperation with the professional committee as moderate. The referees showed some professional improvements; still they experienced scrutiny from the clubs, the media, and the Referee Union. Thus, three of them perceived the outcome of this change process favorably, four naturally, and four negatively.

Alternative antimicrobial strategies are needed. Phage therapy is a promising alternative that is being rediscovered. Despite phage therapy’s 100-year history, there have been no investigations into patient thoughts and concerns. This study aimed to explore patient awareness of and concern about antibiotic resistance and gain insight into the perceptions of phage therapy among a patient group that could potentially benefit from phage therapy. Patients with an active or resolved (healed or amputated) diabetic foot ulcer were eligible to participate. A survey was distributed digitally to eligible patients across Scotland via the NHS Research Scotland Diabetes Network and hard copies were available in diabetic foot clinics at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow. A focus group of five survey respondents was held in Glasgow. Fifty-five survey responses were obtained. There was a high level of awareness (76.4%; N = 55) and concern (83.3%; N = 54) about antibiotic resistance. While largely aware of viruses, most patients had not heard of phage or phage therapy. Patients were no more concerned about phage than antibiotic therapy, with most suggesting more information could alleviate any concerns. Patient acceptability of phage therapy was high, a finding confirmed by the focus group. Patients are concerned about antibiotic resistance and supportive of ‘new’ antimicrobials. We have demonstrated that patients are supportive, enthusiastic and accepting of phage therapy. Although ‘Western’ phage therapy remains in its infancy, an understanding of patient ideas, concerns and expectations will be important in eventually shaping and successfully reintroducing phage therapy.","Macdonald, Katherine E.; Stacey, Helen J.; Harkin, Gillian; Hall, Lesley M.

They are disproportionately affected during the current pandemic. The present study aimed to investigate the psychological impacts of COVID-19 related stressors -resource loss and perceived discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic- on Syrian refugees in Turkey. Further, the buffering role of perceived social support against the detrimental impacts of such stressors was examined. An online cross-sectional study was conducted between September-October 2020. A sample of 345 Syrian refugees in Turkey completed the questions about demographic characteristics, resource loss and perceived discrimination during the pandemic, perceived social support, and depressive and anxiety symptoms. A high level of depressive and anxiety symptoms was reported in our sample. Resource loss and perceived discrimination during the pandemic significantly and positively predicted depressive and anxiety symptoms. Perceived social support acted as a buffer against the detrimental effect of resource loss on mental health. For those with higher perceived social support, resource loss during the pandemic did not significantly predict depressive and anxiety symptoms. The results indicate the detrimental role of COVID-19 related stressors on refugee mental health. Social support is an important protective factor for mental health amidst the pandemic. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the precarious conditions of refugees in all COVID-19 responses and communications.","Kurt, G.; Ilkkursun, Z.; Javanbakht, A.; Uygun, E.; Karaoglan-Kahilogullari, A.; Acarturk, C.",Int J Intercult Relat,155,16

Design: Online cross-sectional survey. Setting: Data were collected between 6th and 7th May 2020. Participants: 2240 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or over. Participants were recruited from YouGov's online research panel. Main outcome measures: Having gone out in the last 24 hours in those who reported symptoms of COVID-19 in their household. Having gone out shopping for items other than groceries, toiletries or medicines (non-essentials), and total number of outings, in the last week in those who reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in their household. Results: 217 people (9.7%) reported that they or someone in their household had symptoms of COVID-19 (cough or high temperature / fever) in the last seven days. Of these people, 75.1% had left the home in the last 24 hours (defined as non-adherent). Factors associated with non-adherence were being male, less worried about COVID-19, and perceiving a smaller risk of catching COVID-19. Adherence was associated with having received help from someone outside your household. Results should be taken with caution as there was no evidence for associations when controlling for multiple analyses. Of people reporting no symptoms in the household, 24.5% had gone out shopping for non-essentials in the last week (defined as non-adherent). Factors associated with non-adherence and with a higher total number of outings in the last week included decreased perceived effectiveness of Government ""lockdown"" measures, decreased perceived severity of COVID-19, and decreased estimates of how many other people were following lockdown rules. Having received help was associated with better adherence. Conclusions: Adherence to self-isolation is poor. As we move into a new phase of contact tracing and self-isolation, it is essential that adherence is improved. Communications should aim to increase knowledge about actions to take when symptomatic or if you have been in contact with a possible COVID-19 case. They should also emphasise the risk of catching and spreading COVID-19 when out and about and the effectiveness of preventative measures. Using volunteer networks effectively to support people in isolation may promote adherence.","Smith, L. E.; Amlot, R.; Lambert, H.; Oliver, I.; Robin, C.; Yardley, L.; Rubin, G. J.",,155,16

Here we report the clinical course and liver pathology in three SARS patients with liver impairment. Three patients who fulfilled the World Health Organization case definition of probable SARS and developed marked elevation of alanine aminotransferase were included. Percutaneous liver biopsies were performed. Liver specimens were examined by light and electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. Reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) using enhanced real‐time PCR was applied to look for evidence of SARS‐associated coronavirus infection. Marked accumulation of cells in mitosis was observed in two patients and apoptosis was observed in all three patients. Other common pathologic features included ballooning of hepatocytes and mild to moderate lobular lymphocytic infiltration. No eosinophilic infiltration, granuloma, cholestasis, fibrosis, or fibrin deposition was noted. Immunohistochemical studies revealed 0.5% to 11.4% of nuclei were positive for proliferative antigen Ki‐67. RT‐PCR showed evidence of SARS‐associated coronavirus in the liver tissues, but not in the sera of all 3 patients. However, electron microscopy could not identify viral particles. No giant mitochondria, micro‐ or macro‐vesicular steatosis was observed. In conclusion, hepatic impairment in patients with SARS is due to SARS‐associated coronavirus infection of the liver. The prominence of mitotic activity of hepatocytes is unique and may be due to a hyperproliferative state with or without disruption of cell cycle by the coronavirus. With better knowledge of pathogenesis, specific therapy may be targeted to reduce viral replication and modify the disease course.

The IFR can be also used as a basis for estimating and monitoring the number of infected individuals in a population, which may be subsequently used to inform policy decisions relating to public health interventions and lockdown strategies. The interpretation of IFR measurements requires the calculation of confidence intervals. We present a number of statistical methods that are relevant in this context and develop an inverse problem formulation to determine correction factors to mitigate time-dependent effects that can lead to biased IFR estimates. We also review a number of methods to combine IFR estimates from multiple independent studies, provide example calculations throughout this note and conclude with a summary and ""best practice"" recommendations.

The purpose of this case report is to highlight the importance of proper selection of antibiotics for treatment of severe MPP and increase awareness concerning the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant MPP. PATIENT CONCERNS: A case of severe life-threatening pneumonia in a 26-year-old man with high fever and cough was non-responsive to azithromycin and fluoroquinolones. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with MPP based on the test results of bronchoalveolar lavage using real-time quantitative PCR method. INTERVENTIONS: Tigecycline was given to the patient after azithromycin and fluoroquinolones failed. OUTCOMES: The patients fever subsided within the first day of tigecycline therapy. He showed rapid symptom resolution and improvement in lung infiltration after 4 days of tigecycline therapy. LESSONS: The case suggests that fulminant MPP should be timely treated with proper antibiotics, and the possible emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant MPP should be of concern.","Yuan, Xin; Liu, Jie; Bai, Changqing; Niu, Wenkai; Wang, Jingjing; Li, Puyuan; Liu, Huiying; Luo, Yuan",Medicine (Baltimore),155,24
638107,638107,638107,Discovering network behind infectious disease outbreak,13.595241,6.815468,2010-11-01,"INTRODUCTION: Clinical microbiology laboratories have had to cope with an increase in the volume of tests due to the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Short turnaround times (TATs) are important for case tracing and to help clinicians in patient management. In such a context, high-throughput systems are essential to process the bulk of the tests. Rapid tests are also required to ensure shorter TATs for urgent situations. In our laboratory, SARS-CoV-2 assays were initially implemented on our custom platform using a previously published method. The commercial cobas 6800 (Roche diagnostics) assay and the GeneXpert Xpress (Cepheid) SARS-CoV-2 assay were implemented on 24 March and 8 April 2020, respectively, as soon as available. HYPOTHESIS/GAP STATEMENT: Despite the abundant literature on SARS-CoV-2 assays, the articles focus mainly on the diagnostic performances. This is to our knowledge the first article that specifically studies the TAT of different assays. AIM: We aimed to describe the impact of various SARS-CoV-2 assays on the TAT at the beginning of the outbreak. METHODOLOGY: In this study, we retrospectively analysed the TAT of all SARS-CoV-2 assays performed in our centre between 24 February and 9 June, 2020. RESULTS: We retrieved 33 900 analyses, with a median TAT of 6.25 h. TATs were highest (6.9 h) when only our custom platform was used (24 February to 24 March, 2020). They were reduced to 6.1 h when the cobas system was introduced (24 March to 8 April, 2020). The implementation of the GeneXpert further reduced the median TAT to 4.8 h (8 April to 9 June, 2020). The GeneXpert system had the shortest median TAT (1.9 h), followed by the cobas (5.5 h) and by our custom platform (6.9 h). CONCLUSION: This work shows that the combination of high-throughput systems and rapid tests allows the efficient processing of a large number of tests with a short TAT. In addition, the use of a custom platform allowed the quick implementation of an in-house test when commercial assays were not yet available.","Marquis, Bastian; Opota, Onya; Jaton, Katia; Greub, Gilbert",J Med Microbiol,155,5

We assessed the rate and clinical presentation of COVID-19, and adherence to therapy in a large cohort of patients with ARD followed-up in a tertiary University-Hospital in Northeast Italy. METHODS: Between April 9th and April 25th(,) 2020, after SARS-CoV-2 infection peak, a telephone survey investigating the impact of COVID-19 on patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) was administered. Demographics, disease activity status, therapy, occupational exposure, and adherence to social distancing advise were also collected. RESULTS: 916 patients (397 SLE, 182 AAV, 176 SSc, 111 RA, 50 IIM) completed the survey. 148 patients developed at least one symptom compatible with COVID-19 (cough 96, sore throat 64, fever 64, arthromyalgias 59, diarrhea 26, conjunctivitis 18, ageusia/hyposmia, 18).

We included children aged 2–16 years with active asthma, defined as three or more recurrent episodes of reversible wheezing. The severity of asthma and of asthmatic exacerbations was recorded. Immunofluorescence assays (IFA) on nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS), serological tests, or both, were used for detection of influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and coronavirus. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays on NPS were used for rhinovirus and enterovirus. Serological tests for Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were performed. A control group of asymptomatic asthmatic outpatients was examined for respiratory viruses (using IFA and PCR). Eighty‐two symptomatic children (mean age, 7.9 years) were examined. Viruses were detected in 38% (enterovirus, 15.8%; rhinovirus, 12%; RSV, 7.3%). Serological tests for atypical bacteria were positive in 10% of patients (C. pneumoniae, 5%; M. pneumoniae, 5%). Among the 27 control subjects (mean age, 7.9 years), one PCR was positive for enterovirus. There was no correlation between severity of chronic asthma or asthmatic exacerbations and the diagnosis of infection. Atypical bacterial pathogen infections were linked with prolonged asthmatic symptoms. In conclusion, we confirmed the high incidence of viral infection in acute exacerbations of asthma, especially enteroviruses or rhinoviruses. Persistent clinical features were more frequently associated with atypical bacterial infections, suggesting that these infections should be investigated and treated in cases of persistent asthmatic symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the impact of prior statin use on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severity and mortality. METHODS: In this observational multicenter study, consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were enrolled. In-hospital mortality and severity of COVID-19 assessed with National Early Warning Score (NEWS) were deemed primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. Propensity score (PS) matching was used to obtain balanced cohorts. RESULTS: Among 842 patients enrolled, 179 (21%) were treated with statins before admission. Statin patients showed more comorbidities and more severe COVID-19 (NEWS 4 [IQR 2–6] vs 3 [IQR 2–5], p < 0.001). Despite having similar rates of intensive care unit admission, noninvasive ventilation, and mechanical ventilation, statin users appeared to show higher mortality rates. After balancing pre-existing relevant clinical conditions that could affect COVID-19 prognosis with PS matching, statin therapy confirmed its association with a more severe disease (NEWS ≥5 61% vs. 48%, p = 0.025) but not with in-hospital mortality (26% vs. 28%, p = 0.185). At univariate logistic regression analysis, statin use was confirmed not to be associated with mortality (OR 0.901; 95% CI: 0.537 to 1.51; p = 0.692) and to be associated with a more severe disease (NEWS≥5 OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.067–2.71; p = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Our results did not confirm the supposed favorable effects of statin therapy on COVID-19 outcomes.

As the advancement of early diagnosis and treatment, the CFR after January 21 (or 22), 2020 is substantially decreased in COVID-19 than before (OR = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.24; P < .00001). CONCLUSIONS: Several factors are confirmed to significantly improve the CFR in patients with COVID-19, which is very important for the treatment and good prognosis of these patients.","Zhao, Jinqiu; Li, Xiaosong; Huang, Wenxiang; Zheng, Junyi",Am J Emerg Med,155,21

Previous reports suggested that many important regulatory proteins in innate immune pathway may be modified by ubiquitin and that many de-ubiquitination (DUB) proteins may affect immunity. Monocyte chemotactic protein-inducing protein 1 (MCPIP1), one of the CCCH Zn finger-containing proteins, was reported to have DUB function, but its effect on IFNβ innate immune was not fully understood. In this study, we uncovered a novel mechanism that may explain how MCPIP1 efficiently inhibits IFNβ innate immune. It was found that MCPIP1 negatively regulates the IFNβ expression activated by RIG-I, STING, TBK1, IRF3. Furthermore, MCPIP1 inhibits the nuclear translocation of IRF3 upon stimulation with virus, which plays a key role in type I IFN expression. Additionally, MCPIP1 interacts with important modulators of IFNβ expression pathway including IPS1, TRAF3, TBK1 and IKKε. Meanwhile, the interaction between the components in TRAF3-TBK1-IKKε complex was disrupted by MCPIP1. These results collectively suggest MCPIP1 as an innate immune regulator encoded by the host and point to a new mechanism through which MCPIP1 negatively regulates IRF3 activation and type I IFNβ expression.","Chen, Xiaojuan; Zhao, Qian; Xie, Qing; Xing, Yaling; Chen, Zhongbin",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,155,3

Recent COVID-19 research further suggests there are major sleep problems and psychological disorders (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression) associated with the reduction of movement and activities, as well as the reduced social interaction. There have been no studies examining the effect of physical activity at home during such periods of isolation. However, based on previous research, potential tactics to overcome these negative effects include home-based exercise, exergaming, dancing to music, and participation in yoga. Adults should accumulate at least 150 min of moderate-intensity and at least 75 min of vigorous-intensity of activity divided in to 5–7 sessions per week. This training volume could be reduced by 30% for children and adolescents if replaced by recess or active play in and around the home.

We define cybersecurity, provide definitions of key cybersecurity constructs relevant to employee behavior, illuminate the unique opportunities available to organizational scientists in the cybersecurity arena (e.g., publication venues that reach new audiences, novel sources of external funding), and provide overall conceptual frameworks of the antecedents of employees’ cybersecurity behavior. In so doing, we emphasize both end-users of cybersecurity in organizations and employees focused specifically on cybersecurity work. We provide an expansive agenda for future organizational science research on cybersecurity—and we describe the benefits such research can provide not only to cybersecurity but also to basic research in organizational science itself. We end by providing a list of potential objections to the proposed research along with our responses to these objections. It is our hope that the current manuscript will catalyze research at the interface of organizational science and cybersecurity.","Dalal, Reeshad S.; Howard, David J.; Bennett, Rebecca J.; Posey, Clay; Zaccaro, Stephen J.; Brummel, Bradley J.",J Bus Psychol,155,16

It is important to acknowledge the considerable pressure placed on frontline medical staff in the face of a new type of coronavirus that is highly infectious and for which no specific treatment is available. Here, we review the various kinds of psychological problems afflicting frontline medical staff who are combatting the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. These include anxiety, insomnia, depression, interpersonal difficulties, and post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome. We further present a summary of countermeasures for alleviating these problems based on our findings. These countermeasures include ensuring the provision of adequate protective gear for frontline medical staff, developing timely and clear guidelines, strengthening social support, and providing clear criteria and additional training, focusing on the choice of frontline medical staff. An understanding of the psychological impacts of an epidemic situation and of relevant countermeasures will contribute to reducing the psychological pressures on frontline medical staff. Consequently, they will be able to cope better with outbreaks of infectious diseases in the future, to reduce the psychological pressure of the front-line medical staff, and to improve the treatment level.","Fu, Xiao-Wei; Wu, Li-Na; Shan, Ling",World J Clin Cases,155,24

METHODS: One two-wave longitudinal web-based survey of sleep, SI, and depression was conducted among 67,905 college students (mean age = 20.23 years, SD = 1.63 years; 31.3% male) during the COVID-19 outbreak (Time1, T1: Feb 3rd to 10th, 2020) and initial remission period (Time2, T2: March 24th to April 3rd, 2020). RESULTS: At T1 and T2, 8.5% and 9.7% of students reported sleep disturbance, 7.6% and 10.0% reported SI, respectively. The prevalence rates of SI at T1 and T2 increased significantly with sleep disturbance and short sleep duration. After adjusting for demographics, pandemic related factors, and depression at T1, sleep disturbance and short sleep duration at T1 were significantly associated with increased risk for SI at T2. Furthermore, sleep disturbance and short sleep duration predicted the new onset and persistence of SI. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that sleep disturbance predicts the development and persistence of SI. Early assessment and treatment of sleep disturbance may be an important strategy for prevention and intervention of SI in individuals after exposure to the special public health emergency of COVID-19.","Wang, Dongfang; Ross, Brendan; Zhou, Xiuzhu; Meng, Dongjing; Zhu, Zhiyi; Zhao, Jingbo; Fan, Fang; Liu, Xianchen",J Psychiatr Res,155,5

Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is associated with cardiometabolic disturbances, is a source of proinflammatory cytokines and a marker of visceral adiposity. We investigated the relation between EAT characteristics and outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Methods and results This post-hoc analysis of a large prospective investigation included all adult patients (≥18 years) admitted to San Raffaele University Hospital in Milan, Italy, from February 25th to April 19th, 2020 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who underwent a chest computed tomography (CT) scan for COVID-19 pneumonia and had anthropometric data available for analyses. EAT volume and attenuation (EAT-At, a marker of EAT inflammation) were measured on CT scan. Primary outcome was critical illness, defined as admission to intensive care unit (ICU), invasive ventilation or death. Cox regression and regression tree analyses were used to assess the relationship between clinical variables, EAT characteristics and critical illness. One-hundred and ninety-two patients were included (median [25th-75th percentile] age 60 years [53-70], 76% men). Co-morbidities included overweight/obesity (70%), arterial hypertension (40%), and diabetes (16%). At multivariable Cox regression analysis, EAT-At (HR 1.12 [1.04-1.21]) independently predicted critical illness, while increasing PaO2/FiO2 was protective (HR 0.996 [95% CI 0.993; 1.00]). CRP, plasma glucose on admission, EAT-At and PaO2/FiO2 identified five risk groups that significantly differed with respect to time to death or admission to ICU (log-rank p<0.0001).

Their immune system declines earlier than healthy individuals, leading to increased susceptibility to infections and higher incidence of autoimmune phenomena. Clinical features of accelerated aging indicate that trisomy 21 increases the biological age of tissues. Based on previous studies suggesting immune senescence in DS, we hypothesized that induction of cellular senescence may contribute to early thymic involution and immune dysregulation. Immunohistochemical analysis of thymic tissue showed signs of accelerated thymic aging in DS patients, normally seen in older healthy subjects. Moreover, our whole transcriptomic analysis on human Epcam-enriched thymic epithelial cells (hTEC), isolated from three DS children, which revealed disease-specific transcriptomic alterations. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of DS TEC revealed an enrichment in genes involved in cellular response to stress, epigenetic histone DNA modifications and senescence. Analysis of senescent markers and oxidative stress in hTEC and thymocytes confirmed these findings. We detected senescence features in DS TEC, thymocytes and peripheral T cells, such as increased β-galactosidase activity, increased levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p16, telomere length and integrity markers and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), all factors contributing to cellular damage. In conclusion, our findings support the key role of cellular senescence in the pathogenesis of immune defect in DS while adding new players, such as epigenetic regulation and increased oxidative stress, to the pathogenesis of immune dysregulation.","Marcovecchio, Genni Enza; Ferrua, Francesca; Fontana, Elena; Beretta, Stefano; Genua, Marco; Bortolomai, Ileana; Conti, Anastasia; Montin, Davide; Cascarano, Maria Teresa; Bergante, Sonia; D’Oria, Veronica; Giamberti, Alessandro; Amodio, Donato; Cancrini, Caterina; Carotti, Adriano; Di Micco, Raffaella; Merelli, Ivan; Bosticardo, Marita; Villa, Anna",Front Immunol,155,28

Probabilistic theories often treat it as axiomatic, whereas it follows from the meanings of conditionals in the theory of mental models. In this theory, intuitive models (system 1) do not represent what is false, and so produce errors in estimates of p(if A then C), yielding instead p(A & C). Deliberative models (system 2) are normative, and yield the proportion of cases of A in which C holds, i.e., the Equation. Intuitive estimates of the probability of a conditional about unique events: If covid-19 disappears in the USA, then Biden will run for a second term, together with those of each of its clauses, are liable to yield joint probability distributions that sum to over 100%. The error, which is inconsistent with the probability calculus, is massive when participants estimate the joint probabilities of conditionals with each of the different possibilities to which they refer.

Methods: 30 COVID-19 patients with current smoking status (29 men, 1 woman) admitted in our database were enrolled as smoking group and 56 COVID-19 patients without smoking history (24 men, 32 women) admitted during the same period were enrolled as a control group. Twenty-seven smoking cases and 55 control cases reached recovery standard and were discharged. Initial and follow-up CT during hospitalization and follow-up CT after discharge were acquired. Thirty quantitative features, including the ratio of infection volume and visual-assessed interstitial changes score including total score, score of ground glass opacity, consolidation, septal thickening, reticulation and honeycombing sign, were analyzed. Results: Initial CT images of the smoking group showed higher scores of septal thickening [4.5 (0–5) vs. 0 (0–4), p = 0.001] and reticulation [0 (0–5.25) vs 0 (0–0), p = 0.001] as well as higher total score [7 (5–12.25) vs. 6 (5–7), p = 0.008] with statistical significance than in the control group. The score of reticulation was higher in the smoking group than in the control group when discharged [0.89 (0–0) vs. 0.09 (0–0), p = 0.02]. The score of septal thickening tended to be higher in the smoking group than the control group [4 (0–4) vs. 0 (0–4), p = 0.007] after being discharged. Quantitative CT features including infection ratio of whole lung and left lung as well as infection ratio within HU (−750, −300) and within HU (−300, 49) were higher in the control group of initial CT with statistical differences. The infection ratio of whole lung and left lung, infection ratio within HU (−750), and within HU (−750, −300) were higher in the control group with statistical differences when discharged. This trend turned adverse after discharge and the values of quantitative features were generally higher in the smoking group than in the control group without statistical differences. Conclusions: Patients with a history of smoking presented more severe interstitial manifestations and more residual lesion after being discharged.

This pattern of infection is quite distinct from the acute/resolving nature of other human pathogenic respiratory viruses, such as influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus. Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 furthermore occurs irrespective of disease severity or development of virus-neutralizing antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 possesses an intensely structured RNA genome, an attribute shared with other human and veterinary coronaviruses and with other mammalian RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus. These are capable of long-term persistence, possibly through poorly understood RNA structure-mediated effects on innate and adaptive host immune responses. The assumption that resolution of COVID-19 and the appearance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies represents virus clearance and protection from reinfection, implicit for example in the susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) model used for epidemic prediction, should be rigorously re-evaluated.","Simmonds, Peter; Williams, Sarah; Harvala, Heli",J Gen Virol,155,20

Drug repurposing efforts are underway to identify compounds that interfere with SARS-CoV-2 replication or the immunopathology it can elicit. Rapamycin is among those being currently tested in clinical trials for impacts on COVID-19 severity. While rapamycin and rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) are FDA-approved for use as mTOR inhibitors in multiple clinical settings, including cancer, we previously found that rapamycin can increase the susceptibility of cells to infection by Influenza A virus. In this study, we tested the impact of rapalogs on cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We report that rapamycin and rapalogs increased SARS-CoV-2 titers in human cervical epithelial and lung epithelial cell lines to different extents, and a similar pattern of enhancement was observed using pseudovirus incorporating viral fusion proteins from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS, and Influenza A Virus. Rapalogs also promoted cell entry driven by SARS-CoV-2 Spike in nasal cells and primary small airway cells, representing proximal and distal ends of the human respiratory tract, respectively. Interestingly, cell entry enhancement by the rapalog ridaforolimus was cell type-dependent, revealing a previously unrecognized functional divergence between rapalogs. The differential activity of rapalogs was associated with their capacity to induce the degradation of interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins, restriction factors that broadly inhibit virus infection. Our findings will spur the development of mTOR inhibitors that do not suppress the cell’s first line of antiviral defense.","Shi, Guoli; Chiramel, Abhilash I.; Majdoul, Saliha; Lai, Kin Kui; Das, Sudipto; Beare, Paul A.; Andresson, Thorkell; Best, Sonja M.; Compton, Alex A.",bioRxiv,155,12

This paper examines the perceptions of old age in the context of establishing a priority order for the COVID-19 vaccine from the perspective of online newspaper commenters. Two research questions are investigated: (1) how do commenters place older people in line for the COVID-19 vaccine? and (2) what frames and factors do commenters use as reasoning for their proposed position of older adults? RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: : This study involves a frame analysis of 440 online comments on an article published by The New York Times on December 1, 2020 about the U.S. recommendations for distributing the coronavirus vaccine. RESULTS: Older adults were referenced as belonging to one of three groups: older long-term care residents, older workers, and older adults retired and/or isolating at home. Two frames emerged from the data as criteria for prioritization: social contribution and vulnerability. Older commenters themselves frequently stated that they should be deprioritized so that others can be inoculated earlier.

Second, for some preventive behaviors, participants believed that their own behaviors were more motivated by prosocial concerns (relative to self‐interest) than were other practicers (pluralistic ignorance). Finally, non‐practicers underestimated the importance of prosocial concerns underlying some preventive behaviors (actor‐observer bias). We discussed the relevance of these social cognitive biases to health education and to Hong Kong people's psychological reactions to SARS.","Tam, Kim‐Pong; Lau, Ivy Yee‐Man; Chiu, Chi‐Yue",Asian J Soc Psychol,155,6

Given the logistical challenges of psychophysical testing, understanding the longitudinal relationship between self‐reported and quantitative measures can help accurately identify patients with persistent olfactory dysfunction. This study aimed to longitudinally correlate measured and subjective olfactory function in COVID‐19 subjects. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal study evaluating subjective and measured olfaction was conducted on ambulatory COVID‐19 subjects. Olfaction scores were obtained using a visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 = anosmia, 10 = normosmia) and the validated 12‐item Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT). Weekly testing was performed until recovery (BSIT ≥ 9/12 and/or VAS = 10/10) or study completion. RESULTS: Eighty‐six polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐positive COVID‐19 subjects were recruited ≤3 days from diagnosis and 52 completed longitudinal testing. Among those with self‐reported smell loss at recruitment, similar levels (75.8%) of objective (BSIT ≥ 9/12) and subjective recovery were obtained using a VAS cutoff ≥8, yet only 30.3% reported complete subjective recovery (VAS = 10). Median times to objective and complete subjective olfactory recovery were 12 ± 2.3 and 24 ± 3.5 days, respectively. Although both measures showed chemosensory improvement, the distributions of objective and full subjective olfactory recovery differed significantly (log rank test χ(2) = 6.46, degrees of freedom [df] = 1, p = 0.011). Overall correlation between BSIT and VAS scores was moderate to strong across longitudinal follow‐up (r (s) = 0.41–0.65). CONCLUSION: Self‐reported and psychophysically measured COVID‐19 olfactory dysfunction improve at similar levels and are moderately correlated longitudinally, yet there is a significant delay in complete subjective recovery. Psychophysical testing in conjunction with qualitative assessments may be considered for counseling and follow‐up of patients with COVID‐19 smell loss.","Prajapati, Divya P.; Shahrvini, Bita; Said, Mena; Srinivas, Shanmukha; DeConde, Adam S.; Yan, Carol H.",Int Forum Allergy Rhinol,155,20

The virus is shed into various body fluids including saliva, which represents a possible source of viral transmission. Thus, we here explored whether human saliva affects ZIKV infectivity. We found that physiological concentrations of pooled saliva dose-dependently inhibit ZIKV infection of monkey and human cells by preventing viral attachment to target cells. The anti-ZIKV activity in saliva could not be abrogated by boiling, suggesting the antiviral factor is not a protein. Instead, we found that purified extracellular vesicles (EVs) from saliva inhibit ZIKV infection. Salivary EVs (saEVs) express typical EV markers such as tetraspanins CD9, CD63 and CD81 and prevent ZIKV attachment to and infection of target cells at concentrations that are naturally present in saliva. The anti-ZIKV activity of saliva is conserved but the magnitude of inhibition varies between individual donors. In contrast to ZIKV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), predominantly spreading via respiratory droplets, is not affected by saliva or saEVs. Our findings provide a plausible explanation for why ZIKV transmission via saliva, i.e. by deep kissing have not been recorded and establish a novel oral innate immune defence mechanism against some viral pathogens.","Conzelmann, Carina; Groß, Rüdiger; Zou, Min; Krüger, Franziska; Görgens, André; Gustafsson, Manuela O; El Andaloussi, Samir; Münch, Jan; Müller, Janis A.",Journal of extracellular vesicles,155,24

Thus, we examined whether treating COVID-19 patients affect the physicians’ mental health differently compared with physicians treating non-COVID-19 patients. In this cohort study, an association was blindly computed between physiologically measured anxiety and attention vigilance (collected from 1 May 2014 to 31 May 31 2016) and self-reports of anxiety, mental health aspects, and sleep quality (collected from 20 April to 30 June 2020, and analyzed from 1 July to 1 September 2020), of 91 physicians treating COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 patients. As a priori hypothesized, physicians treating COVID-19 patients showed a relative elevation in both physiological measures of anxiety (95% CI: 2317.69–2453.44 versus 1982.32–2068.46; P < 0.001) and attention vigilance (95% CI: 29.85–34.97 versus 22.84–26.61; P < 0.001), compared with their colleagues treating non-COVID-19 patients. At least 3 months into the pandemic, physicians treating COVID-19 patients reported high anxiety and low quality of sleep. Machine learning showed clustering to the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 subgroups with a high correlation mainly between physiological and self-reported anxiety, and between physiologically measured anxiety and sleep duration. To conclude, the pattern of attention vigilance, heightened anxiety, and reduced sleep quality findings point the need for mental intervention aimed at those physicians susceptible to develop post-traumatic stress symptoms, owing to the consequences of fighting at the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Dolev, T.; Zubedat, S.; Brand, Z.; Bloch, B.; Mader, E.; Blondheim, O.; Avital, A.",Transl Psychiatry,155,16

Among these, mink are particularly susceptible. Indeed, 10 countries in Europe and North America reported SARS-CoV-2 infection among mink on fur farms. In Denmark, SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly among mink farms and spilled-over back into humans, acquiring mutations/deletions with unknown consequences for virulence and antigenicity. Here we describe a mink-associated SARS-CoV-2 variant (Cluster 5) characterized by 11 amino acid substitutions and four amino acid deletions relative to Wuhan-Hu-1. Temporal virus titration, together with genomic and subgenomic viral RNA quantitation, demonstrated a modest in vitro fitness attenuation of the Cluster 5 virus in the Vero-E6 cell line. Potential alterations in antigenicity conferred by amino acid changes in the spike protein that include three substitutions (Y453F, I692V, and M1229I) and a loss of two amino acid residues 69 and 70 (ΔH69/V70), were evaluated in a virus microneutralization assay. Compared to a reference strain, the Cluster 5 variant showed reduced neutralization in a proportion of convalescent human COVID-19 samples.

Vaccine development itself, however, will not be enough given that a sufficient amount of people will need to be vaccinated for widespread immunity. Vaccine hesitancy is on the rise, varies across countries, and is associated with conspiratorial worldview. Given the rise in COVID-19-related conspiracy theories, we aimed to examine the levels of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its association with beliefs on the origin of the novel coronavirus in a cross-cultural study. METHODS: We conducted an online survey in the UK (N = 1088) and Turkey (N = 3936), and gathered information on participants' willingness to vaccinate for a potential COVID-19 vaccine, beliefs on the origin of the novel coronavirus, and several behavioural and demographic predictors (such as anxiety, risk perception, government satisfaction levels) that influence vaccination and origin beliefs. RESULTS: In all, 31% of the participants in Turkey and 14% in the UK were unsure about getting themselves vaccinated for a COVID-19 vaccine. In both countries, 3% of the participants rejected to be vaccinated. Also, 54% of the participants in Turkey and 63% in the UK believed in the natural origin of the novel coronavirus. Believing in the natural origin significantly increased the odds of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. CONCLUSIONS: Our results point at a concerning level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, especially in Turkey, and suggest that wider communication of the scientific consensus on the origin of the novel coronavirus with the public may help future campaigns targeting COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.","Salali, Gul Deniz; Uysal, Mete Sefa",Psychological medicine,155,1

Four twisted wind profiles with different magnitudes and directions of yaw angles were employed to investigate variations in wind speed with the properties of the twisted wind flows at the pedestrian level. An additional conventional wind profile with similar wind speeds and turbulence intensities to the twisted winds but with zero yaw angles was simulated for comparisons. The mean wind speeds at 77 locations including the perimeter, roadsides, and groups of high-rise buildings were analysed for the conventional and the four twisted wind flows. The comparisons show a tendency of twisted winds to generate higher wind speeds at the pedestrian level than the conventional wind profile. The wind speeds of the twisted winds have a strong dependence on the magnitude and direction of the yaw angles, particularly at locations where the densities of buildings in the neighbourhood are low and hence local wind circulations are significantly modified by the twisted winds.","Weerasuriya, A.U.; Tse, K.T.; Zhang, Xuelin; Li, S.W.",Build Environ,155,5

In recent years, exosomes have been evidenced to facilitate cell–cell communication and signaling through packaging and transporting active biomolecules such as miRNAs and thereby modify the cellular microenvironment favorable for lung cancers. MiRNAs encapsulated inside the lipid bilayer of exosomes are stabilized and transmitted to target cells to exert alterations in the epigenetic landscape.

S-protein is the key target for many therapeutics and vaccines. Potential S-protein–ACE2 fusion inhibitor is expected to block the virus entry into the host cell. In many countries, traditional practices, based on natural products (NPs) have been in use to slow down COVID-19 infection. In this study, a protocol was applied that combines mixed solvent molecular dynamics simulations (MixMD) with high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) to search NPs to block SARS-CoV-2 entry into the human cell. MixMD simulations were employed to discover the most promising stable binding conformations of drug-like probes in the S-protein–ACE2 interface. Detected stable sites were used for HTVs of 612093 NPs to identify molecules that could interfere with the S-protein–ACE2 interaction. In total, 19 NPs were selected with rescoring model. These top-ranked NP–S-protein complexes were subjected to classical MD simulations for 300 ns (3 replicates of 100 ns) to estimate the stability and affinity of binding. Three compounds, ZINC000002128789, ZINC000002159944 and SN00059335, showed better stability in all MD runs, of which ZINC000002128789 was predicted to have the highest binding affinity, suggesting that it could be effective modulator in RBD-ACE2 interface to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Parallel to SIRD modelling, we tend to compare it with the Ising model and derive a quantum circuit that incorporates the rate of infection and rate of recovery, etc as its parameters.

The reports of its person-to-person transmission through close contacts have raised a global concern about its pandemic potential. Here we characterize the six-helix bundle fusion core structure of MERS-CoV spike protein S2 subunit by X-ray crystallography and biophysical analysis. We find that two peptides, HR1P and HR2P, spanning residues 998–1039 in HR1 and 1251–1286 in HR2 domains, respectively, can form a stable six-helix bundle fusion core structure, suggesting that MERS-CoV enters into the host cell mainly through membrane fusion mechanism. HR2P can effectively inhibit MERS-CoV replication and its spike protein-mediated cell–cell fusion. Introduction of hydrophilic residues into HR2P results in significant improvement of its stability, solubility and antiviral activity. Therefore, the HR2P analogues have good potential to be further developed into effective viral fusion inhibitors for treating MERS-CoV infection.

In this study, we internally validated the previously obtained threshold value of 500 m in the 6MWT as differentiating populations with a high and a low risk of postoperative complications after a lobectomy. Between November 2011 and November 2016, 624 patients who underwent a lobectomy and performed the 6MWT preoperatively entered this study. We compared the complication rates of two groups of patients—those who walked more than and those who walked less than 500 m. The patients who did not reach the distance of 500 m in the 6MWT were older (70 vs. 63 years p < 0.001), had worse pulmonary function tests (FEV1% 84 vs. 88 p = 0.041) and had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (p < 0.001). The patients who had a worse result in the 6MWT had a higher complication rate (52% vs. 42% p = 0.019; OR: 1.501 95% CI: 1.066–2.114) and a longer median postoperative hospital stay (7 vs. 6 days p = 0.010). In a multivariate analysis, the result of the 6MWT and pack-years proved to independently influence the risk of postoperative complications. This internal validation study confirms that 500 m is a result of the 6MWT which differentiates patients with a higher risk of postoperative complications and a prolonged hospital stay after a lobectomy.","Marjanski, Tomasz; Wnuk, Damian; Dziedzic, Robert; Ostrowski, Marcin; Sawicka, Wioletta; Rzyman, Witold",J Clin Med,155,16

Here, we use a sero-survey to estimate the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the St. Louis, MO, metropolitan area in a symptom-independent manner. Five hundred three adult and 555 pediatric serum/plasma samples were collected from patients presenting to Barnes-Jewish Hospital or St. Louis Children’s Hospital between 14 April 2020 and 12 May 2020. We developed protocols for in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using spike and nucleoprotein and used the assays to estimate a seroprevalence rate based on our samples. Overall IgG seropositivity was estimated to be 1.71% (95% credible interval [CI], 0.04% to 3.38%) in pediatric samples and 3.11% (95% CI, 0.92% to 5.32%) in adult samples. Seropositivity was significantly lower in children under 5 years of age than in adults, but rates between adults and children aged 5 or older were similar. Of the 176 samples tested from children under 4 years of age, none were positive. IMPORTANCE This study determined the percentages of both children and adult samples from the greater St. Louis metropolitan area who had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in late April to early May 2020. Approximately 1.7 to 3.1% of the tested individuals had antibodies, indicating that they had previously been infected by SARS-CoV-2. These results demonstrate that the extent of infection was about 10 times greater than the number of confirmed cases at that time. Furthermore, it demonstrated that by 5 years of age, children were infected to an extent similar to that of adults.","Smith, Brittany K.; Janowski, Andrew B.; Danis, Jonathan E.; Harvey, Ian B.; Zhao, Haiyan; Dai, Ya-Nan; Farnsworth, Christopher W.; Gronowski, Ann M.; Roper, Stephen; Fremont, Daved H.; Wang, David",mSphere,155,24

But the current in-hospital thromboprophylaxis remains suboptimal and there exists a large gap between clinical practice and guideline-recommended care in China. Methods To facilitate implementation of guideline recommendations, we conduct a multicenter, adjudicator-blinded, cluster-randomized clinical trial, aiming to assess the effectiveness of a system-wide multifaceted quality improvement (QI) strategy on VTE prophylaxis improvement and thromboembolism reduction in clinical setting. Hospitals are randomized into intervention or control group. In intervention group, hospitals receive the concept of appropriate in-hospital thromboprophylaxis plus a multifaceted QI which encompasses four components: (1) an electronic alert combining computer-based clinical decision support system and electronic reminders, (2) appropriate prophylaxis based on dynamic VTE and bleeding risk assessments, (3) periodical audit and interactive feedback on performance, (4) strengthened training and patient education. In control, hospitals receive the concept of recommended prophylaxis alone without QI. Thromboprophylaxis will be at the discretion of hospitals and conducted as usual. With a final sample size of 5760 hospitalized patients in 32 hospitals on mainland China, this trial will examine the effect of QI on improvement in thromboprophylaxis and patient-centered outcomes. This is an open-label trial that patients and healthcare professionals will know group allocation after enrollment, but endpoint adjudicators and statisticians will be blinded. RCT# NCT04211181 Conclusions The system-wide multifaceted QI intervention is expected to facilitate implementation of recommended VTE prophylaxis in hospital, thereafter reducing VTE incidence and relevant adverse events among hospitalized patients in China.","Dong, Fen; Zhen, Kaiyuan; Zhang, Zhu; Si, Chaozeng; Xia, Jiefeng; Zhang, Tieshan; Xia, Lei; Wang, Wei; Jia, Cunbo; Shan, Guangliang; Zhai, Zhenguo; Wang, Chen",Am Heart J,155,2

However, this process has not been well-studied in living cells throughout the course of infection. To define the dynamic process of enterovirus membrane remodeling of major secretory pathway organelles, we have developed plasmid-based reporter systems that utilize viral protease-dependent release of a nuclear-localized fluorescent protein from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane during infection, while retaining organelle-specific fluorescent protein markers such as the ER and Golgi. This system thus allows for the monitoring of organelle-specific changes induced by infection in real-time. Using long-term time-lapse imaging of living cells infected with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB), we detected reporter translocation to the nucleus beginning ~4 h post-infection, which correlated with a loss of Golgi integrity and a collapse of the peripheral ER. Lastly, we applied our system to study the effects of a calcium channel inhibitor, 2APB, on virus-induced manipulation of host membranes. We found that 2APB treatment had no effect on the kinetics of infection or the percentage of infected cells. However, we observed aberrant ER structures in CVB-infected cells treated with 2APB and a significant decrease in viral-dependent cell lysis, which corresponded with a decrease in extracellular virus titers. Thus, our system provides a tractable platform to monitor the effects of inhibitors, gene silencing, and/or gene editing on viral manipulation of host membranes, which can help determine the mechanism of action for antivirals.","Lennemann, Nicholas J.; Evans, Azia S.; Coyne, Carolyn B.",Viruses,155,1

Our survey results show Canadian beekeepers faced two major challenges: 1) disrupted importation of honey bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) (queen and bulk bees) that maintain populations; and 2) disrupted arrival of temporary foreign workers (TFWs). Disruptions in the arrival of bees and labor resulted in fewer colonies and less colony management, culminating in higher costs and lower productivity. Using the survey data, we develop a profitability analysis to estimate the impact of these disruptions on colony profit. Our results suggest that a disruption in either foreign worker or bee arrival allows beekeepers to compensate and while colony profits are lower, they remain positive. When both honey bee and foreign workers arrivals are disrupted for a beekeeper, even when the beekeeper experiences less significant colony health and cost impacts, a colony with a single pollination contract is no longer profitable, and a colony with two pollination contracts has significantly reduced profitability. As COVID-19 disruptions from 2020 and into 2021 become more significant to long-term colony health and more costly to a beekeeping operation, economic losses could threaten the industry’s viability as well as the sustainability of pollination-dependent crop sectors across the country. The economic and agricultural impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed a vulnerability within Canada’s beekeeping industry stemming from its dependency on imported labor and bees. Travel disruptions and border closures pose an ongoing threat to Canadian agriculture and apiculture in 2021 and highlight the need for Canada’s beekeeping industry to strengthen domestic supply chains to minimize future risks.","Bixby, Miriam E F; Polinsky, Matthew; Scarlett, Rod; Higo, Heather; Common, Julia; Hoover, Shelley E; Foster, Leonard J; Zayed, Amro; Cunningham, Morgan; Guarna, M Marta",J Econ Entomol,155,2

The subcutaneous therapy emicizumab was recently approved for treatment of hemophilia A. The objective of this study was to estimate utility values associated with hemophilia A health and treatment states from a Canadian societal perspective, including preferences related to treatment efficacy and frequency and route of administration. METHODS: A vignette-based time trade-off (TTO) utilities elicitation was undertaken in Canadian adults to compare preferences for six hemophilia health states describing prophylactic and on-demand treatment, with varying bleed rates and frequency of treatment administration. A convenience sample was recruited via market research panels and snowball sampling. Health state/vignette definitions were informed by clinical experience, clinical trial results regarding bleed frequency, and validated by qualitative interviews of hemophilia patients and caregivers (n=10). Utilities were estimated via an online, trained interviewer-guided, vignette-based TTO exercise, where respondents valuated health states describing hemophilia patients (adults or children) receiving subcutaneous prophylaxis, intravenous prophylaxis, and on-demand treatments. Analyses included a descriptive analysis by health state; a mixed-effects analysis of utility values adjusted for subcutaneous vs infusion-based therapies and number of bleeds; and for prophylactic regimens, an analysis of utilities by frequency of infusions or injections. RESULTS: TTO interviews were conducted with 82 respondents. Mean utilities [95% CI] were highest for subcutaneous prophylaxis (0.90 [0.87–0.93]), followed by intravenous prophylaxis (0.81 [0.78–0.85]), and on-demand treatment (0.70 [0.65–0.76]). In regression analysis, subcutaneous treatment health states were associated with a utility increment of +0.1112. Additional bleeds and more frequent infusions were associated with lower utility values (−0.0027 per bleed and −0.0003 per infusion). CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous prophylaxis is associated with higher utility values compared to intravenous prophylactic and on-demand treatment, while increased bleeds and infusions are associated with reduced utility.","Johnston, Karissa; Stoffman, Jayson M; Mickle, Alexis T; Klaassen, Robert J; Diles, Demitri; Olatunde, Shade; Eliasson, Lina; Bahar, Roxana",Patient Prefer Adherence,155,22

Conscientious objection policy confusion and variability can arise as it may occasionally be unclear what underpins non-participation. Our objective was to identify, analyze, and synthesize the factors that influenced HCPs who did not participate in ethically complex, legally available healthcare. METHODS: We used Arksey and O'Malley's framework while considering Levac et al.'s enhancements, and qualitatively synthesized the evidence. We searched Medline, CINAHL, JSTOR, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Sociological Abstracts, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global from January 1, 1998, to January 15, 2020, and reviewed the references of the final articles. We included articles written in English that discussed the factors that influenced physicians and registered nurses (RNs) who did not participate in end-of-life (EOL), reproductive technology and health, genetic testing, and organ or tissue donation healthcare areas. Using Covidence, we conducted title and abstract screening, followed by full-text screening against our eligibility criteria. We extracted the article's data into a spreadsheet, analyzed the articles, and completed a qualitative content analysis using NVivo12. RESULTS: We identified 10,664 articles through the search, and after the screening, 16 articles were included. The articles sampled RNs (n = 5) and physicians (n = 11) and encompassed qualitative (n = 7), quantitative (n = 7), and mixed (n = 2) methodologies. The care areas included reproductive technology and health (n = 11), EOL (n = 3), organ procurement (n = 1), and genetic testing (n = 1). One article included two care areas; EOL and reproductive health. The themed factors that influenced HCPs who did not participate in healthcare were: (1) HCPs' characteristics, (2) personal beliefs, (3) professional ethos, 4) emotional labour considerations, and (5) system and clinical practice considerations. CONCLUSION: The factors that influenced HCPs' who did not participate in ethically complex, legally available care are diverse. There is a need to recognize conscientious objection to healthcare as a separate construct from non-participation in healthcare for reasons other than conscience. Understanding these separate constructs will support HCPs' specific to the underlying factors influencing their practice participation.","Brown, Janine; Goodridge, Donna; Thorpe, Lilian; Hodson, Alexandra; Chipanshi, Mary",BMC Med Ethics,155,25

We aimed to describe the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and to investigate the potential risk factors for COVID-19 severity. METHOD: 1,663 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosed COVID-19 from Tongji Hospital between January 14, 2020, and February 28, 2020 were included in the present study. Demographic information, exposure history, medical history, comorbidities, signs and symptoms, chest computed tomography (CT) scanning, severity of COVID-19 and laboratory findings on admission were collected from electronic medical records. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the association between potential risk factors with COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: In the present study, the majority (79%) of 1,663 COVID-19 patients were aged over 50 years old. A total of 2.8% were medical staff, and an exposure history of Huanan seafood market was document in 0.7%, and 7.4% were family infection. Fever (85.8%), cough (36.0%), fatigue (23.6%) and chest tightness (11.9%) were the most common symptoms in COVID-19 patients. As of February 28, 2020, of the 1,663 patients included in this study, 26.0% were discharged, 10.2% were died, and 63.8% remained hospitalized. More than 1/3 of the patients had at least one comorbidity. Most (99.8%) patients had abnormal results Chest CT, and the most common manifestations of chest CT were local patchy shadowing (70.7%) and ground-glass opacity (44.8%). On admission, lymphocytopenia was present in 51.1% of the patients, mononucleosis in 26.6%, and erythrocytopenia in 61.3%. Most of the patients had increased levels of C-reactive protein (80.4%) and D-dimer (64.4%). Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients had more obvious abnormal laboratory results related to inflammation, coagulation disorders, liver and kidney damage (all P <0.05). Older age (OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.47-3.83), leukocytosis (OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.47-3.83), and increased creatine kinase (OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.47-3.83) on admission were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSION: Timely medical treatment and clear diagnosis after the onset might be beneficial to control the condition of COVID-19. Severe patients were more likely to be to be elder, and tended to have higher proportion of comorbidities and more prominent laboratory abnormalities. Older age, leukocytosis, and increased creatine kinase might help clinicians to identify severe patients with COVID-19.","Yu, Caizheng; Lei, Qing; Li, Wenkai; Wang, Xiong; Li, Wengang; Liu, Wei",J Infect Public Health,155,24

Using mixed methods, the current study aimed to use the RE-AIM evaluation framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance) to determine how the football community trust delivered CARE (Cancer and Rehabilitation Exercise) intervention was able to increase participants’ physical activity in order to improve their quality of life and regain physiological and psychological function. Quantitative outcome data were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months using the Cancer Physical Activity Standard Evaluation Framework questionnaire. Semi-structured focus groups (n = 5) captured participants’ (n = 40) lived experience of the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of CARE. Questionnaire data were analysed using repeated measures ANOVAs and qualitative data were thematically analysed. Following diagnosis, CARE was successful in providing participants with a unique and accessible opportunity to become or restart physically activity, by providing a local, socially supportive, and inclusive environment. This resulted in significant increases in physical activity (F((1.58, 23)) = 5.98, p = 0.009), quality of life (QoL) (F((2,36)) = 13.12, p = 0.000) and significant reductions in fatigue (F((1.57,31)) = 11.19, p = 0.000) over 6 months. Participants also reported becoming more active, recovering physical function, regaining independence, and enhanced psychological well-being as a result of attending CARE. Key design features of CARE were also identified across RE-AIM. CARE, a football community trust delivered physical activity intervention was successful in significantly improving participants’ QoL and in regaining the physical and psychological functioning of people living with cancer. Results suggest that maintaining engagement in CARE for 6 months and beyond can support people to maintain these changes.

We developed the Dream Warmer, a low cost, re-usable non-electric infant warmer to prevent and treat hypothermia. METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized stepped-wedge trial. The primary aim was to assess the effect on overall euthermia rates of introducing the warmer compared to standard of care in rural Rwandan hospitals. The secondary aims were to assess effects of warmer introduction on mortality, as well as the safety and feasibility of the warmer. Ten district hospitals participated in the study from November 19th 2019 to July 15th 2020. Patients were eligible to use the warmer if they were 1) hypothermic (temp < 36·5 °C) or 2) or at risk of hypothermia (weight < 2·5 kg or estimated post menstrual age < 35 weeks) when Kangaroo Mother Care was not available. An encounter was defined as the data from an individual infant on a single day. Trial of a Non Electric Infant Warmer for Prevention and Treatment of Hypothermia in Rwanda [NCT03890211]. FINDINGS: Over the study period, 3179 patients were enrolled across the ten neonatal wards, yielding 12,748 encounters; 464 unique infants used the warmer 892 times, 79% eligible due to hypothermia. Because of limited study nurse resources, the warmer was used in only 18% of eligible encounters. Despite this low rate of warmer use, the rate of euthermia rose from 51% (95% CI 50−52%) of encounters pre-intervention to 67% (66−68%) post-intervention; p < 0·0001. Among the encounters in which the warmer was used, only 11% (9–13%) remained hypothermic. While mortality rates pre- and post-intervention did not change, mortality rate among those who used the warmer was significantly lower than among those who did not (0·9% vs 2·8%, p = 0·01). Use of the warmer did not affect hyperthermia rates. There were no safety concerns or instances of incorrect warmer use.

AIVs circulate throughout the poultry trade network in Vietnam, with live bird markets being an integral component to this network. Traders at LBMs exhibit a variety of trading practices, which may influence the transmission of AIVs. We identified trading practices that impacted on AIV prevalence in chickens marketed in northern Vietnamese LBMs. We generated sequencing data for 31 H9N2 and two H5N6 viruses. Viruses isolated in the same LBM or from chickens sourced from the same province were genetically closer than viruses isolated in different LBMs or from chickens sourced in different provinces. The position of a vendor in the trading network impacted on their odds of having AIV‐infected chickens. Being a retailer and purchasing chickens from middlemen was associated with increased odds of infection, whereas odds decreased if vendors purchased chickens directly from large farms. Odds of infection were also higher for vendors having a greater volume of ducks unsold per day. These results indicate how the spread of AIVs is influenced by the structure of the live poultry trading network.","Sealy, Joshua E.; Fournie, Guillaume; Trang, Pham Hong; Dang, Nguyen Hoang; Sadeyen, Jean‐Remy; Thanh, To Long; van Doorn, H.

The M protein is predicted to contain a triple-spanning transmembrane (TM) region, a single N-glycosylation site near its N-terminus that is in the exterior of the virion, and a long C-terminal region in the interior. The M protein harbors a higher substitution rate (0.6% correlated to its size) among viral open reading frames (ORFs) from published data. The four substitutions detected in the M protein, which cause non-synonymous changes, can be classified into three types. One of them results in changes of pI (isoelectric point) and charge, affecting antigenicity. The second changes hydrophobicity of the TM region, and the third one relates to hydrophilicity of the interior structure. Phylogenetic tree building based on the variations of the M protein appears to support the non-human origin of SARS-CoV.

The World Health Organisation has suggested that governments take a proactive response to vaccine hesitancy hotspots based on social and behavioural insights and this paper provides the first representative longitudinal survey of over 3000 participants from Australia that examines the demographic, attitudinal, political and social attitudes and COVID-19 health behavior correlates of vaccine hesitance and resistance to a COVID-19 vaccine. We distinguish between those who may get the vaccine but are not sure (hesitant) from those who will definitely get the vaccine because they are usually a large percentage of the population, and are more likely to be convinced about public health messaging and information about vaccine safety. We find that 59 per cent of Australians say that they will definitely get the vaccine, a further 29 per cent were likely to get the vaccine but are not certain (low levels of hesitancy), 7 per cent will probably not get the vaccine (high levels of hesitancy) and 6 per cent will definitely not get the vaccine (resistant). We find that females, those living in disadvantaged areas, those who reported that risks of COVID-19 was overstated, those who had more populist views and higher levels of religiosity were more likely to be hesitant or resistant while those who had higher levels of household income, those who had higher levels of social distancing, who downloaded the COVID-Safe App, who had more confidence in their state or territory government or confidence in their hospitals, or were more supportive of migration were more likely to intend to get vaccinated. Our findings suggest that vaccine hesitancy, which accounts for a significant proportion of the population can be addressed by public health messaging but that for a significant minority of the population with strongly held beliefs, alternative policy measures may well be needed to achieve sufficient vaccination coverage to end the pandemic.","Edwards, B.; Biddle, N.; Gray, M.; Sollis, K.",,155,20

The household direct contacts of the COVID-19 patients are at highest risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been tried against COVID-19 in the view of its in-vitro virucidal action against SARS-CoV-2, but the role of HCQ as post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is still inconclusive and evolving. METHOD: In this open label control clinical trial asymptomatic individual who had direct contact with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases or had undertaken international travel in last 2 weeks were given the option for taking HCQ prophylaxis and assigned into PEP (N=132) and control groups (N=185). The PEP group received tablet HCQ 800 mg on day one followed by 400 mg once weekly for 3 weeks. Both the groups received standard care of therapy in the form of home quarantine for 2 weeks along with social distancing and personal hygiene and followed up for 4 weeks for new onset COVID-19. RESULTS: Total 50 out of 317 participants (15.8%) had new onset COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 was significantly (p=0.033) lower in PEP group [N=14 out of 132, (10.6%)] as compared to the control group [N=36 out of 185, (19.4%)]. Total absolute risk reduction for the incidence of COVID-19 was -8.8% points. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent occurrence of one case of COVID-19 was 12. The overall relative risk was 0.59 (95% confidence interval, 0.33 to 1.05). The compliance was good and most common ADR was epigastric discomfort with burning sensation, reported by 3 participants and no serious ADR was noted. CONCLUSION: PEP with HCQ has the potential for the prevention of COVID-19 in at-risk individuals. Till definitive therapy is available, continuing PEP with HCQ may be considered in suitable at-risk individuals for the prevention of COVID-19, as endorsed by many national/international health authorities. The present study will encourage the researchers around the globe to reconsider further randomized clinical trials with larger sample size for better evaluation of HCQ as PEP for the prevention of COVID-19.

On return to their home countries, such travellers may require intensive care. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and more recently Ebola haemorrhagic fever, has highlighted the risks. Other well-known communicable pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been described previously. However, malaria remains by far the most important cause of death. The issues related to imported antibiotic resistance and protection from highly contagious diseases are reviewed here. Surveillance strategies based on epidemiological data (country visited, duration of travel, and time elapsed since return) and clinical syndromes, together with systematic search policies, are usually mandatory to limit the risk of an outbreak. Single-bed hospital rooms and isolation according to symptoms should be the rule while awaiting laboratory test results.

Recent evidence demonstrates that miRNAs can also affect RNA virus replication and pathogenesis through direct binding to the RNA virus genome or through virus-mediated changes in the host transcriptome. Here, we review the current knowledge on the interaction between RNA viruses and cellular miRNAs. We also discuss how cell and tissue-specific expression of miRNAs can directly affect viral pathogenesis. Understanding the role of cellular miRNAs during viral infection may lead to the identification of novel mechanisms to block RNA virus replication or cell-specific regulation of viral vector targeting.","Trobaugh, Derek W.; Klimstra, William B.",Trends in Molecular Medicine,155,22

The new disease has challenged policymakers and scientists on key issues such as the magnitude of the first-time problem, the susceptibility of the population, the severity of the disease, and its symptoms. Most countries have adopted lockdown policies to reduce the spatial spread of COVID-19, but they have damaged the economic and moral fabric of society. Timely action to prevent the spread of the virus is critical, and mathematical modeling in non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) policy management has proven to be a major weapon in this fight due to the lack of an effective COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: We present a new hybrid model for COVID-19 dynamics using both an age-structured mathematical model and spatio-temporal model in silico, analyzing the data of COVID-19 in Israel. The age-structured mathematical model is based on SIRD two age-class model. The spatial model examines a circle of day and night (with one-hour resolution) and three main locations (work / school or home) for every individual. Results: We determine mathematically the basic reproduction number ( R_0 ) via the next-generation matrix based on Markov chain theory. Then, we analyze the stability of the equilibria and the effects of the significant differences in infection rates between children and adults. Using the hybrid model, we have introduced a method for estimating the reproduction number of an epidemic in real time from the data of daily notification of cases. The results of the proposed model are confirmed by the Israeli Lockdown experience with a mean square error of 0.205 over two weeks. The model was able to predict changes in ( R_0 ) by opening schools on September 1, 2020, resulting in ( R_0 ) = 2.2, which entailed a month quarantine of all areas of life. According to the model, by extending the school day to 9 hours, and assuming that children and adults go to school and work every day (except weekends), we get a significant reduction in ( R_0 ) of 1.45. Finally, model-based analytical-numerical results are obtained and displayed in graphical profiles. Conclusions: The use of mathematical models promises to reduce the uncertainty in the choice of Lockdown policies. Our unique use of contact details from 2 classes (children and adults), the interaction of populations depending on the time of day (the cycle of day and night), and several physical locations, allowed a new look at the differential dynamics of the spread and control of infection. Using knowledge about how the length of the work and school day affects the dynamics of the spread of the disease can be useful for improving control programs, mitigation, and policy.","Lazebnik, T.; Bunimovich-Mendrazitsky, S.",,155,16

The first section outlines the main measures aimed at combating the viral spread through unprecedented restrictions in the “epidemic” phase and, subsequently, the subsequent easing of restrictions, in the “endemic” phase. In order to bring out the measures’ outcome and provide useful criteria for assessing their effectiveness, the quantitative evolution of both cases testing positive to swab tests and of fine issued to citizens by the police are analyzed. The second section discusses competence areas for State and Regions in bringing in legal measures needed to contain the epidemic. Our aim in this case is to estimate whether the delicate balance between the two administrative levels had an impact on the handling of lockdown and, consequently, also on contagion outcomes. Special focus will be placed on two key sectors that involve national and regional levels: namely healthcare protection and public transport services. Setbacks tied to the priority order of these two institutional levels emerge from evidential data on the period under consideration. Given the necessarily urgent modes of action typical of a health emergency, such setbacks are expected to have inhibited concerted action in the definition and subsequent application of political decisions.","Adobati, Fulvio; Comi, Emanuele; Ghisalberti, Alessandra",Modern Cartography Series,155,26

Neither standard therapy nor consensus for the management of these infections exist. Aztreonam, an old β-lactam antibiotic, is not hydrolyzed by MBLs. However, since many MBL-producing strains co-produce enzymes that could hydrolyze aztreonam (e.g., AmpC, ESBL), a robust β-lactamase inhibitor such as avibactam could be given as a partner drug. We performed a systematic review including 35 in vitro and 18 in vivo studies on the combination aztreonam + avibactam for infections sustained by MBL-producing Gram-negatives. In vitro data on 2209 Gram-negatives were available, showing the high antimicrobial activity of aztreonam (MIC ≤ 4 mg/L when combined with avibactam) in 80% of MBL-producing Enterobacterales, 85% of Stenotrophomonas and 6% of MBL-producing Pseudomonas. Clinical data were available for 94 patients: 83% of them had bloodstream infections. Clinical resolution within 30 days was reported in 80% of infected patients. Analyzing only patients with bloodstream infections (64 patients), death occurred in 19% of patients treated with aztreonam + ceftazidime/avibactam. The combination aztreonam + avibactam appears to be a promising option against MBL-producing bacteria (especially Enterobacterales, much less for Pseudomonas) while waiting for new antimicrobials.","Mauri, Carola; Maraolo, Alberto Enrico; Di Bella, Stefano; Luzzaro, Francesco; Principe, Luigi",Antibiotics (Basel),155,9

Nevertheless, TEM remains essential for certain aspects of virology. It is very useful for the initial identification of unknown viral agents in particular outbreaks, and is recommended by regulatory agencies for investigation of the viral safety of biological products and/or the cells used to produce them.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-center prospective randomized study. All patients undergoing FOB-guided nasal tracheal intubation were randomized to bag-valve-mask ventilation or NIV for preoxygenation followed by intubation. The NIV group were intubated through a sealed hole in a specially designed face mask during continuous NIV support with 100% oxygen. Control patients were intubated with removal of the mask and no ventilatory support. RESULTS: We enrolled 106 patients, including 53 in each group. Pulse oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) after preoxygenation (99% (96%–100%) vs. 96% (90%–99%), p = .001) and minimum SpO(2) during intubation (95% (87%–100%) vs. 83% (74%–91%), p < .01) were both significantly higher in the NIV compared with the control group.

Timing of onset of COVID-19 signs and symptoms amongst cases in Uganda is however not known. METHODS: we utilized data on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed cases to investigate symptom onset timing, from 21(st) March to 4(th) September 2020. Since timing of COVID-19 symptom onset is highly likely to be an interval rather than a point estimate, we generated 3-tertile categories: 1(st), 2(nd) and 3(rd) tertile denoting symptom presentation within 3, 4 to 6 and at least 7 days. We considered all signs and symptoms in the database and analysed using Chi-square test and multinomial logistic regression, controlling for age and sex. RESULTS: we analysed a total of 420 symptomatic case-patients; 72.0% were males, median age of 33 years. Common symptoms were cough (47.6%), running nose (46.2%), fever (27.4%), headache (26.4%) and sore throat (20.5%). We utilized 293 cases with clinical symptom onset date recorded. Most of the patients, 37.5%, presented symptom within 3 days, 31.4% had symptoms in the 2(nd) and 31.4% in 3(rd) tertile, denoting 4 to 6 days and at least 7 days after exposure. Running nose (RRR=0.45, 95%CI: 0.24-0.84) and chest pain (RRR=0.64, 95%CI: 0.09-0.72) were more likely to occur in 3(rd) tertile than 1(st) or 2(nd) tertile. Cases aged ≥20 years were less likely to have symptoms in the 1(st) and 2(nd) tertile compared to ≤20 years (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: our study provides empirical evidence for epidemiological characterization of cases by signs and symptoms which complements current proposals for the length of active monitoring of persons exposed to SARS-CoV-2.","Ario, Alex Riolexus; Mirembe, Bernadette Basuta; Biribawa, Claire; Bulage, Lilian; Kadobera, Daniel; Wamala, Robert",Pan Afr Med J,155,24

In particular, provinces in Italy's Central and Northern macroregions have dealt with disproportionately greater case prevalence and mortality rates than those in the South. In this paper, we compare the morbidity and mortality dynamics of 16th and 17th century Plague outbreaks with those of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic across Italian regions. We also include data on infectious respiratory diseases which are presently endemic to Italy in order to analyze the regional differences between epidemic and endemic disease. A Growth Curve Analysis allowed for the estimation of time-related intercepts and slopes across the 16th and 17th centuries. Those statistical parameters were later incorporated as criterion variables in multiple General Linear Models. These statistical examinations determined that the Northern macroregion had a higher intercept than the Southern macroregion. This indicated that provinces located in Northern Italy had historically experienced higher plague mortalities than Southern polities. The analyses also revealed that this geographical differential in morbidity and mortality persists to this day, as the Northern macroregion has experienced a substantially higher COVID-19 mortality than the Southern macroregion. These results are consistent with previously published analyses. The only other stable and significant predictor of epidemic disease mortality was foreign urban potential, a measure of the degree of interconnectedness between 16th and 17th century Italian cities. Foreign urban potential was negatively associated with plague slope and positively associated with plague intercept, COVID-19 mortality, GDP per capita, and immigration per capita. Its substantial contribution in predicting both past and present outcomes provides a temporal continuity not seen in any other measure tested here. Overall, this study provides compelling evidence that temporally stable geographical factors, impacting both historical and current foreign pathogen spread above and beyond other hypothesized predictors, underlie the disproportionate impact COVID-19 has had throughout Central and Northern Italian provinces.","Jurgensen, JohnMichael; Peñaherrera-Aguirre, Mateo; Figueredo, Aurelio José",Infect Genet Evol,155,18

No study thus far has explored surgeons’ personal compliance with these health behaviours and their relationship with surgical performance. The primary outcomes of this study were self-reported health, health related behaviours, wellbeing, fatigue and surgical performance. METHODS: A survey of validated themes on health related behaviours, workplace variables and performance was distributed to surgical trainees and consultants in the UK and Ireland through the Association for Surgeons in Training (ASiT). Non-parametric analysis was used to determine inferential associations. RESULTS: Ninety five surgeons (51.5% female, 39.9% registrars) completed the survey. 94% and 74% reported ‘good’ or better overall health and mental wellbeing respectively. The majority (54.7%) reported inconsistent sleep patterns. Less than a quarter engage in regular exercise. Sixty two and 64.2% reported being regularly fatigued and bothered by feelings of anxiety and/or depression respectively. Poor self-reported health and wellbeing were associated with poorer reported off-call performance (p < .01). Higher levels of fatigue negatively impacted self-reported surgical and non-surgical task proficiency (p < .01). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Surgeons reported high levels of overall health. However, healthy behaviours around sleep, diet and exercise were not consistently reported. Fewer reported good mental health and emotional well-being. Self-reported health behaviours including sleep and physical activity were associated with surgical performance. Strategies to improve modifiable lifestyle factors which will optimise physical health, mental wellbeing and levels of fatigue may optimise surgical performance.","Whelehan, Dale F.; Connelly, Tara M.; Burke, Joshua R.; Doherty, Eva M.; Ridgway, Paul F.",Ann Med Surg (Lond),155,3

To date, a worldwide approved treatment remains lacking and hence in the context of rapid viral spread and the growing need for rapid action, drug repurposing has emerged as one of the frontline strategies in the battle against SARS-CoV2. Repurposed drugs currently being evaluated against COVID-19 either tackle the replication and spread of SARS-CoV2 or they aim at controlling hyper-inflammation and the rampaged immune response in severe disease. In both cases, the target for such drugs resides in the lungs, at least during the period where treatment could still provide substantial clinical benefit to the patient. Yet, most of these drugs are administered systemically, questioning the percentage of administered drug that actually reaches the lung and as a consequence, the distribution of the remainder of the dose to off target sites. Inhalation therapy should allow higher concentrations of the drug in the lungs and lower concentrations systemically, hence providing a stronger, more localized action, with reduced adverse effects. Therefore, the nano-reformulation of the repurposed drugs for inhalation is a promising approach for targeted drug delivery to lungs. In this review, we critically analyze, what nanomedicine could and ought to do in the battle against SARS-CoV2. We start by a brief description of SARS-CoV2 structure and pathogenicity and move on to discuss the current limitations of repurposed antiviral and immune-modulating drugs that are being clinically investigated against COVID-19. This account focuses on how nanomedicine could address limitations of current therapeutics, enhancing the efficacy, specificity and safety of such drugs. With the appearance of new variants of SARS-CoV2 and the potential implication on the efficacy of vaccines and diagnostics, the presence of an effective therapeutic solution is inevitable and could be potentially achieved via nano-reformulation. The presence of an inhaled nano-platform capable of delivering antiviral or immunomodulatory drugs should be available as part of the repertoire in the fight against current and future outbreaks.","Tammam, Salma N.; El Safy, Sara; Ramadan, Shahenda; Arjune, Sita; Krakor, Eva; Mathur, Sanjay",J Control Release,155,16

The rapid global spread of this novel virus led the World Health Organization declare a pandemic with > 30,000,000 confirmed cases, 946,000 deaths and > 21,000,000 recoveries reported as of 18 September 2020, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. Initial reports from Asia suggested that elderly patients with multiple comorbidities, specifically diabetes, hypertension, and obesity were at an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. As data on these risks have evolved, evidence has increasingly shown that patients with cancer are indeed a particularly vulnerable group. However, the effects of various confounding factors, including an older than average patient population who often have underlying comorbidities including a suppressed immune system and/ or a hypercoagulable state, have been difficult to separate from the effects of having cancer. Common presenting symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 including dyspnoea, cough, fever, fatigue, dysgeusia and, less commonly, diarrhoea and/ or a hyperinflammatory syndrome are equally confusing to clinicians as they all are common symptoms of both cancer and toxicity from anti-cancer therapy. Furthermore, the radiographic dilemma of distinguishing between immune-checkpoint inhibitor-induced pneumonitis from that caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and conflicting data on the effects of certain therapies on patient outcomes has left clinicians with considerable angst on how to help patients with acute or worsening symptoms in an optimal way. Predicted increase in mortality follows not only from the delay in discovery and progress resulting from temporary closing of research laboratories at cancer centers but also from diversion of resources to patient care and temporary suspension of clinical trial enrolment both by companies and local institutions. The possibilities of travelling to specialized medical centers whose activities are essential for the delivery and improvement of patient care were reduced, too. Viral mutations might also occur during transmission and spread; this leads to a statement that SARS-CoV-2 will forever remain a looming threat to the oncological community. What is crucial to remember is that cancer itself is a pandemic with > 18,000,000 people dia-gnosed worldwide every year. Many societies, including the European Society for Medical Oncology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, are providing clinical recommendations for the management of patients with cancer during this challenging time, recognizing that continuation in the precise treatment of our patients is critical for our role of physicians. PURPOSE: The aim of the presentation is to point out the contact or overlapping areas of both mentioned disease entities for the purpose of possible simplification of dia-gnostic and therapeutic management of a cancer patient with suspected or already proven COVID-19 disease.","Sálek, Tomás; Slopovský, Ján; Pörsök, Stefan; Pazderová, Natália; Mináriková, Zuzana; Zomborská, Eva; Spánik, Benjamin",Klin Onkol,155,16
