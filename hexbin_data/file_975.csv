614333,"Possible zinc deficiency in the Serbian population: examination of body fluids, whole blood and solid tissues",2021-04-24,"The spread of COVID-19 implied a large and fast increase of demand for intensive care services. To face this increase in demand, health care systems need to adapt their response by increasing hospital beds, intensive care unit (ICU) capacity and by (re-)deploying doctors and other personnel. This paper proposes a forecast approach based on the Vector Error Correction model for the daily counts of hospitalized patients with symptoms and of patients in ICU, using publicly available data on the current COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, Switzerland and Spain. The level of analysis is the local government managing the health care system response, which corresponds to regions for Italy. The one-week-ahead forecasts are validated with out-of-sample data over successive weeks; they are found to provide timely and robust prediction of ICU capacity needs in Lombardy, the most-affected Italian region, starting from the sample of the first 2 weeks of data. The same methodology is successfully validated on other Italian regions, Switzerland and Spain. This approach may be used in other countries/regions/provinces to help adapt the health care system response to COVID-19 (or other similar disease); for this purpose, the open-source software code to produce the forecasts is provided with the paper.","Berta, Paolo; Paruolo, Paolo; Verzillo, Stefano; Lovaglio, Pietro Giorgio",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33057389/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240150,975
641269,The impact of output volatility on CO(2) emissions in Turkey: testing EKC hypothesis with Fourier stationarity test,2021-08-12,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the relationship among the clinical, logistic, and psychological impacts of COVID-19 on people with epilepsy (PWE), and the impact of COVID-19 on the quality of life. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional anonymized web-based study on PWE, using an online questionnaire to assess the clinical, logistic, and psychological impacts of COVID-19, including Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) and Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-31). RESULT: 461 patients were recruited, with a mean age of 39.21 ± 15.88 years, majority female (50.1%), with focal epilepsy (54.0%), and experienced seizures at least once yearly (62.5%). There were 13.0% experienced seizure worsening during COVID-19 period, which were associated with baseline seizures frequency ≥ 1 per month (32.0% vs. 6.2%, p < 0.001), worries of seizure worsening (18.0% vs. 10.9%, p < 0.001), difficulty to go emergency unit (24.4% vs. 10.4%, p < 0.001), AEDs ran out of stock (23.2% vs. 11.6%, p < 0.05), self-adjustment of AED dosages (26.4% vs. 11.3%, p < 0.001), inadequate sleep (22.4% vs. 9.2%, p < 0.001), and stress (23.4% vs.10.1%, p < 0.01). Participants experiencing seizure worsening reported greater anxiety (8.10 ± 5.011 vs. 4.84 ± 3.989, p < 0.001) and depression (6.05 ± 3.868 vs. 3.86 ± 3.589, p < 0.001). Logistic regression showed baseline seizures frequency >1 per month (OR, 14.10) followed by anxiety (OR, 3.90), inadequate sleep (OR, 0.37), and treated in UMMC (OR, 0.31) as the predictors for seizure worsening during COVID-19 period. Poorer total QOLIE-31 score was noted in those with seizure worsening (48.01 ± 13.040 vs. 62.15 ± 15.222, p < 0.001). Stepwise regression highlighted depression as the main negative predictor for quality of life (β = −0.372, p < 0.001), followed by anxiety (β = -0.345, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A significant number of PWE experienced seizure worsening during COVID-19 period, which was related to the clinical, logistic, and psychological factors. Quality of life was affected by the seizure worsening and the psychological stress.","Koh, May-Yi; Lim, Kheng-Seang; Fong, Si-Lei; Khor, Si-Bao; Tan, Chong-Tin",Epilepsy Behav,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33631434/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525505021000834; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525505021000834,975
