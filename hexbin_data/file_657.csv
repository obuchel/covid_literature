2991,Ecological and evolutionary approaches to managing honeybee disease,2017-08-22,"Honeybee declines are a serious threat to global agricultural security and productivity. Although multiple factors contribute to these declines, parasites are a key driver. Disease problems in honeybees have intensified in recent years, despite increasing attention to addressing them. Here we argue that we must focus on the principles of disease ecology and evolution to understand disease dynamics, assess the severity of disease threats, and control these threats via honeybee management. We cover the ecological context of honeybee disease, including both host and parasite factors driving current transmission dynamics, and then discuss evolutionary dynamics including how beekeeping management practices may drive selection for more virulent parasites. We then outline how ecological and evolutionary principles can guide disease mitigation in honeybees, including several practical management suggestions for addressing short- and long-term disease dynamics and consequences.","Brosi, Berry J.; Delaplane, Keith S.; Boots, Michael; de Roode, Jacobus C.",Nat Ecol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5749923/,657
14383,Internet of Medical Things: An Effective and Fully Automatic IoT Approach Using Deep Learning and Fine-Tuning to Lung CT Segmentation,2020-11-24,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is strongly associated with worse asthma control and poorer quality of life. The current obesity epidemic has reached historically high levels, with an estimated prevalence rate of 37% in the general United States (US) population. However, less is known about trends in the prevalence of obesity among individuals with asthma or which sociodemographic groups are at higher risk for increased weight. METHODS: The study was conducted with data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) study, a nationally representative probability-based sample of the US population. We included participants ≥18 years of age who were interviewed between 1999 and 2016. Using stratified weighting, we estimated the annual prevalence of participants with, and without a diagnosis of asthma, classified according to their body mass index (BMI), into: normal weight (18.5–25 kg/m(2)), overweight (25–30 kg/m(2)), or obese (>30 kg/m(2)). We calculated the annual odds of obesity among participants with vs. without asthma to assess if trends among individuals with asthma followed those of the general US population. Nominal regression analysis assessed the association between age, sex, race/ethnicity, and income with prevalence of obesity among participants with asthma. RESULTS: Among the 543,574 BRSFF participants with asthma, the prevalence of overweight and obesity changed from 34.3% and 24.7% in 1999 to 28.8% and 41.1% in 2016, respectively. The odds ratio (OR) of obesity in patients with asthma compared to the general population without asthma, increased during the same period from 1.39 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.36–1.36) in 1999 to 1.75 (95% CI: 1.75–1.76) in 2016. Adjusted analysis showed that older (OR: 2.32, 95% CI: 2.32–2.33), Black (OR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.61–1.61) and Hispanic (OR: 1.29, 95%. CI: 1.28–1.29) participants with asthma had higher rates of obesity. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a substantial increase in the prevalence of obesity among individuals with asthma in the last two decades, beyond what could be explained by general population trends. These results suggest that obesity is an increasing determinant of asthma morbidity and should be particularly targeted in minorities with asthma.","Lurbet, Maria Fernanda; Rojano, Belen; Whittaker Brown, Stacey-Ann; Busse, Paula; Holguin, Fernando; Federman, Alex D.; Wisnivesky, Juan P.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7052313/,657

The winter mushroom (Flammulina filiformis) is cultivated at a large commercial scale in East Asia and is a species with a preference for low temperatures. This study investigated fruiting body development in F. filiformis by comparing transcriptomes of 4 developmental stages, and compared the developmental genes to a 200-genome dataset to identify conserved genes involved in fruiting body development, and examined the response of heat sensitive and -resistant strains to heat stress. Our data revealed widely conserved genes involved in primordium development of F. filiformis, many of which originated before the emergence of the Agaricomycetes, indicating co-option for complex multicellularity during evolution. We also revealed several notable fruiting-specific genes, including the genes with conserved stipe-specific expression patterns and the others which related to sexual development, water absorption, basidium formation and sporulation, among others. Comparative analysis revealed that heat stress induced more genes in the heat resistant strain (M1) than in the heat sensitive one (XR). Of particular importance are the hsp70, hsp90 and fes1 genes, which may facilitate the adjustment to heat stress in the early stages of fruiting body development. These data highlighted novel genes involved in complex multicellular development in fungi and aid further studies on gene function and efforts to improve the productivity and heat tolerance in mushroom-forming fungi.","Liu, Xiao-Bin; Xia, En-Hua; Li, Meng; Cui, Yang-Yang; Wang, Pan-Meng; Zhang, Jin-Xia; Xie, Bao-Gui; Xu, Jian-Ping; Yan, Jun-Jie; Li, Jing; Nagy, László G.; Yang, Zhu L.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7567395/,657

17018,"Report of the 1st International Electronic Conference on Toxins (IECT2021), 16–31 January 2021",2021-04-09,"The use of psychotropic medication in children is increasing worldwide. Children with developmental disabilities seem to be prescribed these medications at a higher rate compared to their non-disabled peers. Little is known about prescribing in non-Western, middle-income studies. In Iran, the file records of 1133 children, aged 2 to 17 years, assessed as having autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or an intellectual disability (ID) in Tehran City and Province from 2005 to 2019 were collated, and information from parental reports of medications was extracted. Upwards of 80% of children with ASD and 56% of those with ID were prescribed a psychotropic medication with around one quarter in each group taking two or more medications. The rates were higher among male children showing difficult-to-manage behaviors such as hyperactivity, but less so for children of fathers with higher levels of education. The lack of alternative management strategies may be a significant driver for the use of psychotropic medications in Iran and other Low and Middle Income countries, despite their known side effects, and their failure to address the developmental needs of the children. Rather, multi-disciplinary, behavioral, therapeutic, and educational interventions are required, but these are not available widely in Iran, although a start has been made.","McConkey, Roy; Samadi, Sayyed Ali; Mahmoodizadeh, Ameneh; Taggart, Laurence",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8069874/,657

METHODS: Hospital records of 483 consecutive neonates who underwent surgical intervention between January 2013 and December 2017 were reviewed, and perioperative variables were recorded. RESULTS: We found that the prevalence of SSI was 87.5% when the body weight was less than 1500 g. When the operative age was between seven and 14 days, the probability of no SSI is about 93.9%. When the duration of the aortic cross-clamp was more than 60 min, the prevalence of SSI was 91.2%. The prevalence without SSI was 96.6% when the duration of DSC was less than 24 h. However, when the duration of DSC was more than 120 h, the prevalence of SSI was 88.9% (p = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: With the prolongation of aortic clamping duration, the probability of occurrence of SSI increased in neonatal CHD with DSC. The age at operation and body weight are closely related to the occurrence of SSI in neonatal CHD patients with DSC.","Yang, Yuzhong; Wang, Jie; Cai, Lina; Peng, Wei; Mo, Xuming",Ital J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8424398/,657

A blueprint for a structured, qualitative inventory and report, describing the relevant characteristics of the emerging agent, which helps to make ad hoc decisions and which identifies gaps in our knowledge. 2. Two more sophisticated “off the shelf” methods for the quantitative analysis of threats to blood safety are mentioned: the Biggerstaff-Petersen model and the European Up-Front Risk Assessment Tool (EUFRAT). The Biggerstaff-Petersen model estimates the number of potentially infectious donations, while EUFRAT also takes into account the components prepared from donations and the efficacy of various mitigating interventions. 3.

In Interactive Recommender Systems (IRS), user preferences and the system’s fairness status are constantly changing over time. Existing fairness-aware recommenders mainly consider fairness in static settings. Directly applying existing methods to IRS will result in poor recommendation. To resolve this problem, we propose a reinforcement learning based framework, FairRec, to dynamically maintain a long-term balance between accuracy and fairness in IRS. User preferences and the system’s fairness status are jointly compressed into the state representation to generate recommendations. FairRec aims at maximizing our designed cumulative reward that combines accuracy and fairness. Extensive experiments validate that FairRec can improve fairness, while preserving good recommendation quality.","Liu, Weiwen; Liu, Feng; Tang, Ruiming; Liao, Ben; Chen, Guangyong; Heng, Pheng Ann",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206277/,657

33191,A Deep Learning Approach to Aspect-Based Sentiment Prediction,2020-05-06,"Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an incremental approach to software development. Despite it is claimed to improve both quality of software and developers’ productivity, the research on the claimed effects of TDD has so far shown inconclusive results. Some researchers have ascribed these inconclusive results to the negative affective states that TDD would provoke. A previous (baseline) experiment has, therefore, studied the affective reactions of (novice) developers—i.e., 29 third-year undergraduates in Computer Science (CS)—when practicing TDD to implement software. To validate the results of the baseline experiment, we conducted a replicated experiment that studies the affective reactions of novice developers when applying TDD to develop software. Developers in the treatment group carried out a development task using TDD, while those in the control group used a non-TDD approach. To measure the affective reactions of developers, we used the Self-Assessment Manikin instrument complemented with a liking dimension. The most important differences between the baseline and replicated experiments are: (i) the kind of novice developers involved in the experiments—third-year vs. second-year undergraduates in CS from two different universities; and (ii) their number—29 vs. 59. The results of the replicated experiment do not show any difference in the affective reactions of novice developers. Instead, the results of the baseline experiment suggest that developers seem to like TDD less as compared to a non-TDD approach and that developers following TDD seem to like implementing code less than the other developers, while testing code seems to make them less happy.","Romano, Simone; Scanniello, Giuseppe; Baldassarre, Maria Teresa; Fucci, Davide; Caivano, Danilo",Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7251620/,657

Thus, organizations pay significant attention to and invest in the explicit identification and definition of their business services. This is, however, not a trivial endeavor as multiple concerns that are intrinsic to the concept of business service should be taken into consideration in identifying services. Existing business service identification methods used in isolation do not offer adequate coverage for these concerns. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel method assembled by situational method engineering from a set of existing service identification methods, taking the best aspects from each of them. In this paper, we present an instantiation of the situational method engineering approach alongside the details of the constructed method. We also provide a demonstration of the method with an illustrative scenario based on a real-life business case.","Adali, O.

Rapid changes can be realized using conceptual modelling. The design and engineering methodology for organizations (DEMO) is an established modelling method for representing the organization domain of an enterprise. However, heterogeneity in enterprise design stakeholders generally demand for transformations between conceptual modelling languages. Specifically, in the case of DEMO, a transformation into business process modelling and notation (BPMN) models is desirable to account to both, the semantic sound foundation of the DEMO models, and the wide adoption of the de-facto industry standard BPMN. Model transformation can only be efficiently applied if tool support is available. Our research starts with a state-of-the-art analysis, comparing existing DEMO modelling tools. Using a design science research approach, our main contribution is the development of a DEMO modelling tool on the ADOxx platform. One of the main features of our tool is that it addresses stakeholder heterogeneity by enabling transformation of a DEMO organization construction diagram (OCD) into a BPMN collaboration diagram.

Eight publications were selected for this review. The primary endpoint was the incidence of VAP. Different oral care methods for preventing VAP were the subject of this review. Two studies that were reviewed in this article showed significant statistical difference between the intervention group and the control group regarding different oral care for lowering the incidence of VAP. The rest of the studies showed no significant statistical difference between the intervention group and the control group, but showed the importance of meticulous oral hygiene in those patients. Mechanically ventilated patients who suffer from poor oral hygiene are exposed to the harmful accumulation of oral plaque and the initiation of VAP. Proper oral care by qualified care givers can reduce the incidence of VAP. Proper oral care needs to be considered part of the medical treatment plan when a patient is admitted to the ICU to lower the incidence rates of VAP. Oral care treatment of ventilated patients in the intensive care units, for prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia, is with high clinical relevance, decreasing morbidity and mortality in the ICU. We recommend that ICU medical teams will plan a protocol of oral care treatment, based on our article results, and implement it as part of the daily routine.","Gershonovitch, Ron; Yarom, Noam; Findler, Mordechai",SN Compr Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7260467/,657

Therefore, the likelihood of encountering an individual who has experienced significant trauma within forensic settings is high (Dalenberg, Straus, & Ardill, 2017). Further, forensic psychologists are frequently called upon to assess the impact of such traumatic events and to opine about their connection to a specific psycho-legal issue such as damages in a civil case or the presence of extreme emotional disturbance or mitigating factors in criminal matters. Childhood trauma that has occurred repeatedly and cumulatively, particularly within the context of family relationships, has been referred to as complex trauma. Complex trauma has been shown to result in significant difficulties in a broad range of capabilities such as affect regulation, dissociation, identity development, relational capacities, and somatic distress (Courtois and Ford 2009). The author delineates core ethical principles and challenges encountered in forensic assessment both generally and more specifically in the forensic assessment of complex trauma and dissociation. She also details practical strategies for responding to those challenges.

Previous work was limited to multi-core parallelism or relied on manual orchestration of the solving process. Our approach uses one master per problem to initialize the solving process and automatically discovers and releases compute nodes through elastic resource usage. Multiple problems can be solved in parallel on shared compute nodes, controlled by a custom peer-to-peer based load-balancing protocol.

Finding feasible welding paths that make use of the potential of the technology is a computationally complex problem as it requires planning paths in 3D. All parts of the object to be manufactured have to be visited in few welding paths. The search for such welding paths in 3D can be mapped to searching for a fragmented Hamiltonian path in a mathematical graph. We propose a SAT-based approach to finding such fragmented Hamiltonian paths that is suitable for planning WAAM paths. We show how to encode the search for such paths as a mix of SAT clauses and one non-clausal constraint that can be integrated into the SAT solver itself. The reasoning power of the solver enables us to impose additional constraints coming from the application domain on the planned paths, and we show experimentally that in this way, we can find welding paths for relatively complex object geometries.","Ehlers, Rüdiger; Treutler, Kai; Wesling, Volker",Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing - SAT 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7326536/,657

CDCL uses systematic exploration of the search space and has the ability to learn new clauses. SLS examines the neighborhood of the current complete assignment. Unlike CDCL, it lacks the ability to learn from its mistakes. This work revolves around the question whether it is beneficial for SLS to add new clauses to the original formula. We experimentally demonstrate that clauses with a large number of correct literals w. r. t. a fixed solution are beneficial to the runtime of SLS. We call such clauses high-quality clauses. Empirical evaluations show that short clauses learned by CDCL possess the high-quality attribute. We study several domains of randomly generated instances and deduce the most beneficial strategies to add high-quality clauses as a preprocessing step. The strategies are implemented in an SLS solver, and it is shown that this considerably improves the state-of-the-art on randomly generated instances.

One of these variants is generalized resolution, which allows to infer strong constraints, but suffers from the growth of coefficients it generates while combining pseudo-Boolean constraints. Another variant consists in using weakening and division, which is more efficient in practice but may infer weaker constraints. In both cases, weakening is mandatory to derive conflicting constraints. However, its impact on the performance of pseudo-Boolean solvers has not been assessed so far. In this paper, new application strategies for this rule are studied, aiming to infer strong constraints with small coefficients. We implemented them in Sat4j and observed that each of them improves the runtime of the solver. While none of them performs better than the others on all benchmarks, applying weakening on the conflict side has surprising good performance, whereas applying partial weakening and division on both the conflict and the reason sides provides the best results overall.","Le Berre, Daniel; Marquis, Pierre; Wallon, Romain",Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing - SAT 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7326540/,657

This paper proposes a novel technique based on this observation. Roughly speaking, a given quantified bit-vector formula is reduced and sent to a solver, an obtained model is then extended to the original bit-widths and verified against the original formula. We also present an experimental evaluation demonstrating that this technique can significantly improve the performance of state-of-the-art smt solvers Boolector, CVC4, and Q3B on quantified bit-vector formulas from the smt-lib repository.","Jonáš, Martin; Strejček, Jan",Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing - SAT 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7326550/,657

35965,A Data-Driven Student Model to Provide Adaptive Support During Video Watching Across MOOCs,2020-06-09,"BACKGROUND: Continuing professional development (CPD) activities delivered by simulation to independently practicing physicians are becoming increasingly popular. At present, the educational potential of such simulations is limited by the inability to create effective curricula for the CPD audience. In contrast to medical trainees, CPD activities lack pre-defined learning expectations and, instead, emphasize self-directed learning, which may not encompass true learning needs. We hypothesize that we could generate an interprofessional CPD simulation curriculum for practicing pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) physicians in a single-center tertiary care hospital using a deliberative approach combined with Kern’s six-step method of curriculum development. METHODS: From a comprehensive core list of 94 possible PEM clinical presentations and procedures, we generated an 18-scenario CPD simulation curriculum. We conducted a comprehensive perceived and unperceived needs assessment on topics to include, incorporating opinions of faculty PEM physicians, hospital leadership, interprofessional colleagues, and expert opinion on patient benefit, simulation feasibility, and value of simulating the case for learning. To systematically rank items while balancing the needs of all stakeholders, we used a prioritization matrix to generate objective “priority scores.” These scores were used by CPD planners to deliberately determine the simulation curriculum contents. RESULTS: We describe a novel three-step CPD simulation curriculum design method involving (1) systematic and deliberate needs assessment, (2) systematic prioritization, and (3) curriculum synthesis. Of practicing PEM physicians, 17/20 responded to the perceived learning needs survey, while 6/6 leaders responded to the unperceived needs assessment. These ranked data were input to a five-variable prioritization matrix generating priority scores. Based on local needs, the highest 18 scoring clinical presentations and procedures were selected for final inclusion in a PEM CPD simulation curriculum. An interim survey of PEM physician (21/24 respondents) opinions was collected, with 90% finding educational value with the curriculum. The curriculum includes items not identified by self-directed learning that PEM physicians thought should be included. CONCLUSIONS: We highlight a novel methodology for PEM physicians that can be adapted by other specialities when designing their own CPD simulation curriculum. This methodology objectively considers and prioritizes the needs of practicing physicians and stakeholders involved in CPD.","Leung, James S.; Brar, Mandeep; Eltorki, Mohamed; Middleton, Kevin; Patel, Leanne; Doyle, Meagan; Ngo, Quang",Adv Simul (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7326623/,657
35974,Student Dropout Prediction,2020-06-09,"Colistin is the last resort for the treatment of infections with carbapenem-resistant (CR) Gram-negative bacteria particularly Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB). Currently, both colistin-resistant and -heteroresistant A. baumannii isolates have been reported globally. We therefore investigated the colistin heteroresistance rate in 75 non-duplicate colistin-susceptible CRAB clinical isolates from a Thai university collected in 2016. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of colistin for all isolates were determined by broth microdilution method and carbapenemase genes were detected by PCR methods. All isolates were genotyped by ERIC-PCR method and screened for colistin heteroresistance by modified population analysis profile (PAP) method. The colistin MIC range for the 75 isolates was 0.5–2 µg/mL, with MIC(50) and MIC(90) of 1 and 2 µg/mL, respectively. Thirty-three isolates (44%) were considered colistin-heteroresistant with subpopulations growing at 3–8 μg/mL of colistin. After three daily passages of the subpopulations on antibiotic-free medium, their colistin MICs ranged from 4 to > 32 µg/mL, with MIC(50) and MIC(90) of 32 and > 32 µg/mL, respectively. Eight different ERIC-PCR profiles were obtained among the 33 isolates and all carried bla(OXA-23-like). The high rate of colistin heteroresistance in the CRAB isolates highlights the possibility of treatment failure of CRAB infections by colistin due to the selection of colistin-resistant subpopulations.","Thet, Khin Thet; Lunha, Kamonwan; Srisrattakarn, Arpasiri; Lulitanond, Aroonlug; Tavichakorntrakool, Ratree; Kuwatjanakul, Waewta; Charoensri, Nicha; Chanawong, Aroonwadee",World J Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7327205/,657

36004,Exploring the Role of Perspective Taking in Educational Child-Robot Interaction,2020-06-10,"BACKGROUND: Acute encephalopathy (AE) is a common complication of critical illness and is associated with increased short and long-term mortality. In this study, we evaluated the role of cefepime in causing AE. METHODS: Retrospective case–control study involving consecutive patients enrolled in the intensive care units (ICUs) of Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN between July 1, 2004 and December 31, 2015. AE was defined by the presence of delirium or depressed level of consciousness in the absence of deep sedation. Controls were identified as patients not developing AE and were matched by propensity score for age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, 24-h Apache III score and invasive ventilation use. RESULTS: The total number of eligible ICU admissions during our study period was 152,999. AE was present in 57,726 (37.7%) with a median AE duration of 17 (interquartile range [IQR] 4.0–51.8) hours. We matched 14,645 cases with AE with the same number of controls. Cefepime was used in 1241 (4.2%) patients and its use was associated with greater incidence of AE [713 (4.9%) vs 528 (3.6%), p < 0.001] and duration [unit estimate 0.73; (95% CI 0.542–0.918)]. On multivariate analysis, cefepime was associated with an increased likelihood of AE after controlling for shock, midazolam infusion and acute kidney injury [OR 1.24 (95% CI 1.10–1.27)]. These associations were also present after controlling for prior chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSION: The use of cefepime is associated with increased likelihood and duration of AE. These associations are stronger among patients with impaired renal function, but can also occur in patients without renal impairment.

36010,An Approach to Model Children’s Inhibition During Early Literacy and Numeracy Acquisition,2020-06-10,"ABSTRACT: African swine fever (ASF), a disease of obligatory declaration to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), has contributed to poverty and underdevelopment of affected areas. The presence of ASF has been historically neglected in Africa, contributing to its uncontrolled expansion and favouring its spread to continental Europe on at least three occasions, the last one in 2007 through the Republic of Georgia. Since then, African swine fever virus (ASFV) has spread to neighbouring countries, reaching the European Union in 2014, China in the summer of 2018 and spreading through Southeast Asia becoming a global problem. Lack of available vaccines against ASF makes its control even more difficult, representing today the number one threat for the swine industry worldwide and negatively affecting the global commerce equilibrium. MAIN BODY: In this review, we intend to put in perspective the reality of ASF vaccination today, taking into account that investment into ASF vaccine development has been traditionally unattractive, overall since ASF-free areas with large swine industries applied a non-vaccination policy for diseases listed by the OIE. The dramatic situation suffered in Asia and the increasing threat that ASF represents for wealthy countries with large swine industries, has dramatically changed the perspective that both private and public bodies have about ASF vaccinology, although this is controversial. The feasibility of modifying the ASFV genome has led to safe and efficacious experimental recombinant live attenuated viruses (LAVs). The main challenge today will be confirming the safety and efficacy of these technologies in the field, accelerating transfer to the industry for official registration and commercialization. The complexity of ASFV, together with the lack of knowledge about the mechanisms involved in protection and the specific antigens involved in it, requires further investment in research and development. Although far from the efficacy achieved by LAVs, subunit vaccines are the optimal choice for the future. If the world can wait for them or not is a contentious issue. CONCLUSION: Despite their inherent disadvantages, LAVs will be the first technology to reach the market, while subunit vaccines will need much further research to become a successful commercial reality.","Bosch-Camós, Laia; López, Elisabeth; Rodriguez, Fernando",Porcine Health Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7329361/,657

Protein SUMOylation increases in response to several stressful situations, from viral infections to trauma. In this framework, an increasing amount of evidence has implicated SUMOylation in several neurodegenerative diseases, including PD.

This level will only grow as the provinces grapple with the pandemic and its fiscal effects. Some believe surging provincial debts have brought Canadian federalism to a critical juncture: they have greatly increased the odds of federal measures to stabilize provincial finances. This article assesses this claim. The cleanest and most balanced path to fiscal sustainability is a combination of enhanced federal transfers, which would bolster provincial fiscal capacity, and national fiscal rules, which would constrain provincial borrowing. But the former is unlikely to restore sustainability on its own, and the latter would require a severe provincial debt crisis, which Canada's existing fiscal federal structures can avoid. COVID-19 has increased the odds of certain reforms, and it is difficult to predict their long-run effects. But any obvious paths to fiscal sustainability remain hidden.","Hanniman, Kyle",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7330280/,657

In the current work, we argue that resource losses that give rise to budget contractions require a coping strategy that not only influences choice in the moment but also changes underlying consumer preferences. We show that the preference restructuring that occurs when coping with a budget loss also leads to stabilization of preferences. Specifically, a consumer who allocates a budget to a set of items prior to a budget contraction and allocates that same budget post-contraction when the budget is fully restored will allocate the restored budget to fewer options in the set. Coping with the contraction helps consumers prioritize what matters to them, leading to refinement of preference. This within-consumer preference refinement effect exists for budgets of time, space, and money. We identify boundary conditions (i.e., significant budget contractions and self-determined contraction allocations are necessary for prioritization to occur) and rule out non-prioritization explanations (e.g., anchoring and under-adjusting). These findings suggest that marketers should focus on capturing consumers who are dealing with budget contractions as this is one of the moments where individuals revisit and rediscover what matters most to them.","Ross, Gretchen R; Meloy, Margaret G; Carlson, Kurt A",J Consum Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7337841/,657

However, the focus in digital mathematical libraries and scientific documents often lies more on an accurate presentation of the formulae rather than providing uniform access to the semantic information. But, presentational math formats do not provide exclusive access to the underlying semantic meanings. One has to derive the semantic information from the context. As a consequence, the workflow of experimenting and publishing in the Sciences often includes time-consuming, error-prone manual conversions between presentational and computational math formats. As a contribution to improve this workflow, we propose a context-sensitive approach that extracts semantic information from a given context, embeds the information into the given input, and converts the semantically enhanced expressions to computer algebra systems.","Greiner-Petter, André; Schubotz, Moritz; Aizawa, Akiko; Gipp, Bela",Mathematical Software - ICMS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7340963/,657

In particular, software for formal mathematics (such as proof checkers) require formal input languages.

Data dependence profiling allows for automatically assessing parallelisation potential; Yet, data dependence profiling is notoriously slow and requires large memory, as it generally requires keeping track of each memory access. This paper considers employing a simple abstract single-trace analysis method using simple interval and congruent modulo domains to track dependencies at lower time and memory costs. The method gathers and abstracts the set of all memory reference addresses for each static memory access instruction. This method removes the need for keeping a large shadow memory and only requires a single pair-wise analysis pass to detect dependencies among memory instructions through simple intersection operations. Moreover, the combination of interval and congruent domains improves precision when compared with only using an interval domain representation, mainly when the data is not accessed in a dense access pattern. We further improve precision through partitioning memory space into blocks, where references in each block abstracted independently. An initial performance study is conducted on SPEC CPU-2006 benchmark programs and polyhedral benchmark suite. Results show that the method reduces execution time overhead by 1.4[Formula: see text] for polyhedral and 10.7[Formula: see text] for SPEC2006 on average; and significantly reduces memory by 109780[Formula: see text] and 6981[Formula: see text] for polyhedral and SPEC2006 respectively; the method has an average precision of 99.05% and 61.37% for polyhedral and SPEC respectively.

With the large increase in the aging population and the prevalence of osteoporosis, the number of elderly osteoporotic patients needing spinal fusion has risen dramatically. Due to reduced bone quality, postoperative complications such as implant failures, fractures, post-junctional kyphosis, and pseudarthrosis are more commonly seen after spinal fusion in osteoporotic patients. Therefore, pharmacologic treatment strategies to improve bone quality are commonly pursued in osteoporotic cases before conducting spinal fusions. The two most commonly used pharmacotherapeutics are bisphosphonates and parathyroid hormone (PTH) analogs. Evidence indicates that using bisphosphonates and PTH analogs, alone or in combination, in osteoporotic patients undergoing spinal fusion, decreases complication rates and improves clinical outcomes. Further studies are needed to develop guidelines for the administration of bisphosphonates and PTH analogs in osteoporotic spinal fusion patients in terms of treatment duration, potential benefits of sequential use, and the selection of either therapeutic agents based on patient characteristics.","Atesok, Kivanc; Stippler, Martina; Striano, Brendan M.; Xiong, Grace; Lindsey, Matthew; Cappellucci, Elysia; Psilos, Alexandra; Richter, Sven; Heffernan, Michael J.; Theiss, Steven; Papavassiliou, Efstathios",Orthop Rev (Pavia),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7461648/,657

Common methods of evaluating nutritional status include direct human body measurement, creatinine height index (CHI) and subject global assessment of nutrition (SGA). Malnourished patients should receive enteral or parenteral nutrition support. 4. Immune therapies for severe hepatitis include promoting hepatocyte regeneration (e.g. with glucagon, hepatocyte growth factor and prostaglandin E1), glucocorticoid suppressive therapy, and targeting molecular blocking. Corticosteroid treatment should be early and sufficient, and adverse drug reactions monitored. Treatments currently being investigated are those targeting Toll-like receptors, NK cell/NK cell receptors, macrophage/immune coagulation system, CTLA-4/PD-1 and stem cell transplantation. 5. In addition to conventional drugs and radioiodine, corticosteroids and artificial liver treatment can also be considered for severe hepatitis patients with hyperthyreosis. Patients with gestational severe hepatitis require preventive therapy for fetal growth restriction, and it is necessary to choose the timing and method of fetal delivery. For patients with both diabetes and severe hepatitis, insulin is preferred to oral antidiabetic agents to control blood glucose concentration. Liver toxicity of corticosteroids and immune suppressors should be monitored during treatment for severe hepatitis in patients with connective tissue diseases including SLE, RA and sicca syndrome. Patient with connective tissue diseases should preferably be started after the antiviral treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues. 6. An artificial liver can improve patients’ liver function; remove endotoxins, blood ammonia and other toxins; correct amino acid metabolism and coagulation disorders; and reverse internal environment imbalances. Non-bioartificial livers are suitable for patients with early and middle stage severe hepatitis; for late-stage patients waiting for liver transplantation; and for transplanted patients with rejection reaction or transplant failure. The type of artificial liver should be determined by each patient’s condition and previous treatment purpose, and patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions and complications. Bio- and hybrid artificial livers are still under development. 7. MELD score is the international standard for choosing liver transplantation. Surgical methods mainly include the in situ classic type and the piggyback type; transplantation includes no liver prophase, no liver phase or new liver phase. Preoperative preparation, management of intraoperative and postoperative complications and postoperative long-term treatment are keys to success. 8. Severe hepatitis belongs to the categories of “acute jaundice”, “scourge jaundice”, and “hot liver” in traditional Chinese medicine. Treatment methods include Chinese traditional medicines, acupuncture and acupoint injection, external application of drugs, umbilical compress therapy, drip, blow nose therapy, earpins, and clysis. Dietary care is also an important part of traditional Chinese medicine treatment.","Wang, Yu-Ming; Li, Ke; Dou, Xiao-Guang; Bai, Han; Zhao, Xi-Ping; Ma, Xiong; Li, Lan-Juan; Chen, Zhi-Shui; Huang, Yuan-Cheng",Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Hepatitis B,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7498915/,657
39665,Cascaded deep learning classifiers for computer-aided diagnosis of COVID-19 and pneumonia diseases in X-ray scans,2020-09-22,"Targeted immunization of centralized nodes in large-scale networks has attracted significant attention. However, in real-world scenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited thereby precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or quarantine) in order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of the current COVID-19 epidemic. Here, we study a novel immunization strategy where only n nodes are observed at a time and the most central among these n nodes is immunized. This process can globally immunize a network. We find that even for small n (≈10) there is significant improvement in the immunization (quarantine) which is very close to the levels of an immunization with full knowledge. We develop an analytical framework for our method and determine the critical percolation threshold p(c) and the size of the giant component P(∞) for networks with arbitrary degree distributions P(k). In the limit of n → ∞ we recover prior work on targeted immunization, whereas for n = 1 we recover the known case of random immunization. Between these two extremes, we observe that as n increases, p(c) increases quickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization with complete information. In particular, we find a new general scaling relationship between |p(c)(∞) − p(c)(n)| and n as |p(c)(∞) − p(c)(n)| ∼ n(−1)exp ( − αn). For Scale-free (SF) networks, where P(k) ∼ k(−γ), 2 < γ < 3, we find that p(c) has a transition from zero to non-zero when n increases from n = 1 to O(log N) (where N is the size of network). Thus, for SF networks, having knowledge of ≈log N nodes and immunizing them can dramatically reduce epidemic spreading. We also demonstrate our limited knowledge immunization strategy on several real-world networks and confirm that in these real networks, p(c) increases significantly even for small n.","Liu, Yangyang; Sanhedrai, Hillel; Dong, GaoGao; Shekhtman, Louis M; Wang, Fan; Buldyrev, Sergey V; Havlin, Shlomo",Natl Sci Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7499760/,657

40634,Deep learning based detection and analysis of COVID-19 on chest X-ray images,2020-10-09,"ISSUE: Early epidemiology established higher risk of morbidity & mortality amongst infected older individuals or those having specific chronic diseases, consuming most hospital care. Also where demand exceeding supply of healthcare, mortality was very high. As an island nation with one central main hospital, not overwhelming the healthcare system whilst avoiding total lockdown was key. DESCRIPTION: On the 27-03-2020, the Superintendent of Public Health enacted the Protection of Vulnerable Persons Order, specifying that these categories (or subcategories thereof) of persons are to be granted vulnerable status: age >65; pregnant; persons suffering from diabetes; immunosuppressed; cancer; end stage renal failure; respiratory disease; cardiac disease; heart failure. Such persons were entitled to stay at home, to be granted special leave from work, entitled to a monthly allowance by social services. One could go out only to attend to essential or urgent personal matters, e.g. groceries, medicines, medical needs, bank etc. with mitigation measures. Exemptions were only granted to special categories such as healthcare workers, farmers, or headship positions. In addition, the carers & staff of most nursing homes voluntarily decided to isolate themselves inside the homes for periods of 2/3 weeks. Thanks to a very active family support network, offspring, relatives or neighbours ran basic errands for them, or else organised deliveries. This legal status has been lifted on the 5th June 2020. RESULTS: This status was granted to 126 000 persons, including 14000 employed persons. Only 9 deaths occurred in Malta out of 664 cases in a population of 500000 up till 20th June 2020, with a case fatality rate of 1.35% - one of the lowest in Europe. LESSONS: Protection of vulnerable individuals can be a cornerstone of COVID-19 public health response if mobility is effectively restricted in this subpopulation. KEY MESSAGES: Protection of the vulnerable reduces healthcare & mortality burden. Effective legal & economic support measures, & extensive societal engagement required.","Calleja, N; Gatt, M; Azzopardi, M; Xuereb, E; GrechMercieca, E; Micallef, R; Buttigieg, D; Camilleri, L; Galea, A; Gauci, C",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543406/,657

The Hainan gibbon Nomascus hainanus is the world’s most critically endangered primate, and one of the priority conservation actions identified is to establish artificial canopy corridors to reconnect fragmented forests. The effectiveness of artificial canopy bridge as a conservation tool for wild gibbons has not been widely tested, and the results are rarely published. We constructed the first canopy bridge for Hainan gibbon in 2015 to facilitate passage at a natural landslide; mountaineering-grade ropes were tied to sturdy trees with the help of professional tree climbers and a camera trap was installed to monitor wildlife usage. Hainan gibbon started using the rope bridge after 176 days, and usage frequency increased with time. All members in the gibbon group crossed the 15.8 m rope bridge except adult male. Climbing was the predominant locomotor mode followed by brachiation. This study highlights the use and value of rope bridges to connect forest gaps for wild gibbons living in fragmented forests. While restoring natural forest corridors should be a priority conservation intervention, artificial canopy bridges may be a useful short-term solution.","Chan, Bosco Pui Lok; Lo, Yik Fui Philip; Hong, Xiao-Jiang; Mak, Chi Fung; Ma, Ziyu",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7567071/,657

Smoke from their fires reddens the sun, closes airports, shuts schools and governments – and kills millions of people (World Health Organization (WHO). who.int/health-topics/air-pollution#tab=tab_1). Their fires release 16.6 billion tonnes of CO(2), and emit 9.8 billion tonnes CO(2)e, 1.1 billion tonnes of smog precursors and 66 million tonnes of PM2.5. (Akagi et al., Atmospheric Chem Physics 4039-4071, 2011; Environmental Protection Agency, epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials; Food and Agriculture Organization, FAOSTAT, http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data) [See Attachments 1–3. For details of the Attachments, please see the section below entitled “Availability of data and materials.”]. No one yet has stopped the burning. Seminars, health warnings, bans, threats, jailings, shootings – nothing has worked, because not one has offered farmers a better alternative. This is the story of how Warm Heart, a small, community development NGO, learned enough about small farmers’ plight to collaborate with them to develop the technology, training and social organization to mobilize villages to form biochar social enterprises. These make it profitable for farmers to convert crop waste into biochar, reducing CO(2)e, smog precursor and PM2.5 emissions, improving health and generating new local income – in short, to address the big three SDGs (1, 2 and 3) from the bottom. Warm Heart, however, wanted more; it wanted a system so appealing that it would spread by imitation and not require outside intervention. Based on what it has learned, Warm Heart wants to teach others that the knowledge to stop the smoke and improve the quality of one’s life does not require outside experts and lots of money. It wants to teach that anyone can learn to create a more sustainable world by themselves. This article traces the experiential learning process by which Warm Heart and its partners achieved their goals and shares Warm Heart’s open source solution. It serves four purposes. The article closely explores an experiential learning process. It details the underlying logic, workings and consequences of crop waste burning in the developing world. It demonstrates the application of this knowledge to the development of a sustainable – even profitable – solution to this global problem that does not require costly outside intervention but can be undertaken by local communities and small NGOs anywhere. Finally, it models how local communities, small NGOs and social investors can turn this global problem into a profitable business opportunity.","Shafer, Michael",Sustain Earth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680978/,657

Pathogenesis of underlying critical illness polyneuromyopathy (CIPNM) remains incompletely understood. This exploratory study investigated whether longitudinal neuromuscular ultrasound examinations and cytokine analyses in correlation to classical clinical and electrophysiological assessment contribute to the understanding of CIPNM. METHODS: Intensive care unit patients were examined every 7 days until discharge from hospital. Clinical status, nerve conduction studies, electromyography as well as ultrasound of peripheral nerves and tibial anterior muscle were performed. Cytokine levels were analyzed by a bead-based multiplex assay system. RESULTS: Of 248 screened patients, 35 patients were included at median of 6 days (IQR: 8) after admission to intensive care unit. Axonal damage was the main feature of CIPNM. At the peak of CIPNM (7 days after inclusion), nerve ultrasound showed cross-sectional area increase of tibial nerve as a sign of inflammatory edema as well as hypoechoic nerves as a possible sign of inflammation. Cytokine analyses showed signs of monocyte and macrophage activation at this stage. Fourteen days after inclusion, cytokines indicated systemic immune response as well as profiles associated to neovascularization and regeneration. CONCLUSIONS: Exploratory neuromuscular ultrasound and cytokine analyses showed signs of inflammation like macrophage and monocyte activation at the peak of CIPNM followed by a systemic immune response parallel to axonal damage. This underlines the role of both axonal damage and inflammation in pathogenesis of CIPNM.

43809,COVID-19 classification in X-ray chest images using a new convolutional neural network: CNN-COVID,2021-01-04,"Ophiopogonin D (OPD) and Ophiopogonin D′ (OPD′) are two bioactive ingredients in Ophiopogon japonicus. Previously published studies have often focused on the therapeutic effects related to OPD's antioxidant capacity but underestimated the cytotoxicity-related side effects of OPD′, which may result in unpredictable risks. In this study, we reported another side effect of OPD′, hemolysis, and what was unexpected was that this side effect also appeared with OPD. Although hemolysis effects for saponins are familiar to researchers, the hemolytic behavior of OPD or OPD′ and the interactions between these two isomers are unique. Therefore, we investigated the effects of OPD and OPD′ alone or in combination on the hemolytic behavior in vitro and in vivo and adopted chemical compatibility and proteomics methods to explain the potential mechanism. Meanwhile, to explain the drug-drug interactions (DDIs), molecular modeling was applied to explore the possible common targets. In this study, we reported that OPD′ caused hemolysis both in vitro and in vivo, while OPD only caused hemolysis in vivo. We clarified the differences and DDIs in the hemolytic behavior of the two isomers. An analysis of the underlying mechanism governing this phenomenon showed that hemolysis caused by OPD or OPD′ was related to the destruction of the redox balance of erythrocytes. In vivo, in addition to the redox imbalance, the proteomics data demonstrated that lipid metabolic disorders and mitochondrial energy metabolism are extensively involved by hemolysis. We provided a comprehensive description of the hemolysis of two isomers in Ophiopogon japonicus, and risk warnings related to hemolysis were presented. Our research also provided a positive reference for the development and further research of such bioactive components.","Xu, Huan-Hua; Jiang, Zhen-Hong; Sun, Yu-Ting; Qiu, Li-Zhen; Xu, Long-Long; Tang, Xiang-Lin; Ma, Zeng-Chun; Gao, Yue",Oxid Med Cell Longev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7755485/,657

We analyze the risk and intensity of the decline in the values of the basic stock indices by means of selected methods of survival analysis. The spreading pandemic within a few months covered all continents and had a significant impact on the socio-economic situation of all countries. We studied the time of the 20% drop in stock market indices. This is a value that is taken as a sign of a crisis. In order to assess the probability of indices’ value decrease, we use the Kaplan–Meier’s estimator. We determine the risk of decline by means of a logit model and the intensity of the decline by means of an empirical hazard estimator and the Cox proportional hazard model. The intensity and risk of the decline of stock indices varied from continent to continent. The obtained results show that the intensity is highest in the fourth and eighth week after the peak and is the highest on European exchanges and then American and Asian exchanges (including Australia). The risk of falling the stock indices’ prices is the highest in America, followed by Europe, Asia and Australia, and lowest in Africa. Half of the analyzed indices record a 20% drop in value after 52 days (median duration). The study is a prelude to further analyses related to the crisis and the normalization of the situation on world stock exchanges.

In order to mitigate its negative effects, governments worldwide took action by prohibiting at first certain activities and in some cases by a countrywide lockdown. Greece was among the countries that were struck by the pandemic. Governmental authorities took action in limiting the spread of the pandemic through a series of countermeasures, which built up to a countrywide lockdown that lasted 42 days. METHODOLOGY: This research aims at identifying the effect of certain socioeconomic factors on the travel behaviour of Greek citizens and at investigating whether any social groups were comparatively less privileged or suffered more from the lockdown. To this end, a dynamic online questionnaire survey on mobility characteristics was designed and distributed to Greek citizens during the lockdown period, which resulted in 1,259 valid responses. Collected data were analysed through descriptive and inferential statistical tests, in order to identify mobility patterns and correlations with certain socioeconomic characteristics. Additionally, a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) was developed in order to examine the potential influence of socioeconomic characteristics to trip frequency before and during the lockdown period. RESULTS: Outcomes indicate a decisive decrease in trip frequencies due to the lockdown. Furthermore, the model’s results indicate significant correlations between gender, income and trip frequencies during the lockdown, something that is not evident in the pre-pandemic era.","Politis, Ioannis; Georgiadis, Georgios; Nikolaidou, Anastasia; Kopsacheilis, Aristomenis; Fyrogenis, Ioannis; Sdoukopoulos, Alexandros; Verani, Eleni; Papadopoulos, Efthymis",Eur,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7968570/,657

We previously showed that whole body periodic acceleration (pGz), the sinusoidal motion of the supine body head-foot ward direction significantly improves survival and decreases microvascular permeability in a lethal model of sepsis. We tested the hypothesis that pGz improves LPS induced cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction and decreases LPS pro-inflammatory cytokine response when applied pre- or post-treatment. Isolated cardiomyocytes were obtained from mice that received LPS who had been pre-treated with pGz for three days (pGz-LPS) or control. Peak shortening (PS), maximal velocity of shortening (+dL/dt), and relengthening (-dL/dt) as well as diastolic intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(+2)](d)), sodium ([Na(+)](d)), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cardiac troponin (cTnT) production were measured. LPS decreased PS, +dL/dt, and -dL/dt, by 37%, 41% and 35% change respectively (p < 0.01), increased [Ca(+2)](d), [Na(+)](d), ROS, and cTnT by 343%, 122%, 298%, and 610% change respectively (p < 0.01) compared to control. pGz pre-treatment attenuated the parameters mentioned above. In a separate cohort, the effects of a lethal dose of LPS on protein expression of nitric oxide synthases (iNOS, eNOS, nNOS), pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in hearts of mice was studied in pre-treated with pGz for three days prior to LPS (pGz-LPS) and post-treated with pGz 30 min after LPS (LPS-pGz) were determined. LPS increased expression of early and late iNOS and decreased expression of eNOS, phosphorylated eNOS (p-eNOS), and nNOS. Both pre- and post-treatment with pGz markedly reduced early and late pro-inflammatory surge. Therefore, pre- and post-treatment with pGz improves LPS-induced cardiomyocyte dysfunction, decreases iNOS expression, and increases cytoprotective eNOS and nNOS, with decreased pro-inflammatory response. Such results have potential for translation to benefit outcomes in human sepsis.","Adams, Jose A.; Lopez, Jose R.; Uryash, Arkady; Sackner, Marvin A.",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7970274/,657

These measures are expected to impact air quality levels during this period by decreasing the concentrations of air pollutants. This paper investigates the major trends of ambient air pollution (SO(2), NO(2), CO, O(3), and PM(10)), and maps the spatiotemporal variability of air pollutants in Makkah city, using a continuous air quality monitoring network (6 sites) during the pre-pandemic period. Findings indicate the presence of a significant decrease of concentration rates during the lockdown period, compared with the pre-pandemic period, by 26.34% for SO(2), 28.99% for NO(2), 26.24% for CO, 11.62% for O(3), and 30.03% for PM(10).

Different regulators take primary responsibility. New Zealand and Australia jointly regulate GMOs used as food primarily through the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act. Each country has its own environmental regulator. The apex law for research and release is the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms (HSNO) Act. The New Zealand courts have confirmed that products of synthetic biology and gene/genome editing techniques are GMOs for purposes of regulation under the HSNO Act. In some parts of the country, regulation also involves local government where districts or regions have opted to regulate under the Resource Management Act. There have been calls from some sectors to revise the definitions of GMOs and approach to regulation. However, the current government has indicated that this is not a priority and that doing so would harm the agricultural sector. The law as currently framed has contributed to there being no evidence of harm to human health or the environment, and no economic losses either. However, a recent determination by the Environmental Protection Agency to allow open air use of nucleic acids on eukaryotic organisms is too fresh to speculate on future effects.","Heinemann, Jack A.; Coray, Dorien S.; Kurenbach, Brigitta",GMOs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972035/,657

47780,A Comprehensive Dataset from a Smart Grid Testbed for Machine Learning Based CPS Security Research,2021-01-28,"The environment can be well-defined as all forms that surround both living elements (such as humans or animals, fishes and birds) as well as non-living elements, itself classified as both moving (such as air and water) and non-moving (such as mountains and forests). Human activities do interact with the bio-physical environment in a multifaceted manner connecting different geographical levels. The existence of all living forms on this planet gradually evolved to build a healthy and well-balanced environment throughout the space and time. The new economic demand should operate in a way that shields the biophysical environment to maintain the balanced and sustainable growth both at the present and in the future. We must not merely consider the natural resources, such as forests, as carbon sinks. Rather, it is the time to reconsider them as vital resources that provide vital elements such as fresh air for our crucial survival. Human beings inhale oxygen from the environment and release carbon dioxide back while plants simultaneously absorb carbon dioxide and give out oxygen, thus maintaining a balance between the two. Another significant contributor to the GHGs is the livestock emission (mostly Methane) which many of us often ignore. Radical changes in either of the consumption-release patterns can lead to an unmanageable environmental balance. Presently the world is facing enormous population growth and pressure. Capitalism has fuelled it by exploiting natural resources at a faster pace than ever. Formerly, nature itself used to check ecological balance through extreme events such as natural disasters as well as hazardous epidemics. The arrival of modern health care systems and advancements in the field of science and technology can control epidemics and diminish the effects of natural disasters today. At the same time, we are becoming increasingly susceptible to diseases and the rate is rapidly increasing. The complexity of the man-nature relationship has significantly altered in today’s world. In the past, nature was seen as necessary and beneficial on which amplification of human need in today’s world has left its footprint. Therefore, a minor environmental change nowadays puts significant impacts on human life. However, the perception of what constitutes a ‘hazard’ and ‘disaster’ changes over time (Paton and Johnston, 2001; Furedi, 2007). A hazard is a dangerous incident that brings a menace to humans, while a disaster is a stern disturbance striking over a shorter or longer duration that grounds extensive material and/or, or ecological loss for the both human and natural enevironments that surpasses the capacity of the impacted community to survive back using its immediate own resources again (Hankins, 2015). Hazards will be considered disasters once they affect humans, but if they occur in an unpopulated area, they will remain hazardous. Since the man-nature relationship is not identical over different periods of time and at different places, the intensity of disasters or natural outbreaks are different accordingly (Zhao et al., 2006). Developing countries pay the most once a disaster hits. These fatalities in developing countries due to natural hazards are over 20 times bigger in terms of GDP than the industrialised countries (Peduzzi et al., 2002).","Mukherjee, Subham; Kar, Surajit; Pal, Sukdeb",Environmental Management: Issues and Concerns in Developing Countries,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972487/,657

Additionally, MBL and the MBL-associated serine proteases-1 and -2 have been associated with the coagulation system. Therefore, it is not surprising that MBL deficiency has been associated with increased susceptibility to various infectious and autoimmune diseases. As a key component of the innate immune system, MBL is particularly important when the adaptive immune response is either immunocompromised or immunosuppressed; consequently, the majority of the reported cases of MBL deficiency associated with disease are found in infants or young children and immunocompromised patients. In this chapter, we will give a comprehensive overview of the literature on MBL by discussing its structure, function, interaction with its serine proteases, genetics and its role in association with various pathologies.","Doulami, Christiana; Kishore, Uday; Sim, Robert B.; Schwaeble, Wilhelm",The Collectin Protein Family and Its Multiple Biological Activities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972515/,657

Adverse outcomes associated with PM2.5 range from autism, auto theft, and COVID-19 mortality to elderly mortality, suicide, and violent crime. Many influential articles argue that reducing National Ambient Air Quality Standards for PM2.5 is desirable to reduce these outcomes; of late, it has become fashionable to explicitly interpret estimated statistical associations causally, implying that reducing PM2.5 would reduce associated adverse outcomes, typically by making untested modeling assumptions to justify interpreting association as causation. Yet, other studies have found that reducing particulate pollution dramatically, by as much as 70% and dozens of micrograms per cubic meter, has not detectably affected all-cause mortality rates even after decades, despite strong, statistically significant positive exposure concentration-response (C-R) associations between them (Zigler and Dominici 2014; see also Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-57358-4_17).","Cox Jr., Louis Anthony",Quantitative Risk Analysis of Air Pollution Health Effects,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978598/,657

Research shows that increasing mutual interaction and integration among countries and different cultures encourage visitors and contribute to tourism sector development. In this respect, in the light of available data, globalization performance in Turkey has been ongoing above the world average since 1970. On the other hand, the country has suffered terror attacks that are a significant deterrent factor for tourism. Hundreds of bombings and armed assaults occurred until very recently. However, empirical evidence on the role of terrorism and globalization in the tourism sector is not sufficient to clearly understand tourist behaviors and to provide new insights into the literature. Considering the probable effects of globalization and terrorism, Turkey is an excellent case to investigate tourism sector development within this framework. Therefore, this study aims to investigate how tourist arrivals to Turkey react to globalization level and terror attacks by using advanced time-series analysis covering the period 1980–2018.

In a highly politicized situation, which is at the same time prone to violence, the constituent power of the people is easily misused or dangerously fragmented. The usurpation of power by a particular group, the re-establishment of an authoritarian order or even civil war may be the unintended consequences. On the other hand, democratic constitutions know provisions for states of exception which allow to cope with such situations with authoritative means in order to preserve the constitutional order. Why should they then be banned to create one? That might suggest that authoritative constitution-making could be an effective alternative to democratic constitution-making for the establishment of a well-ordered polity. This hypothesis is formulated on the basis of Aristotelian political philosophy, the theory of constitutions as rational precommitments and some aspects of the political theories of John Rawls and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

One novelty of our technique is that it allows the verification of neural networks that include both binarized and non-binarized components. Neural network verification is computationally very difficult, and so we propose here various optimizations, integrated into our SMT procedure as deduction steps, as well as an approach for parallelizing verification queries.

One of these adjustments involved the increasing use of haemostatic sealants such as Floseal in the management of epistaxis allowing reduced admission rates and hospital stay lengths for patients therefore reducing their risk of exposure to Covid-19. AIMS: To improve SHO’s confidence in using Floseal in the management of epistaxis. METHODS: A primary online survey was conducted to assess local ENT SHO’s confidence in making up and using haemostatic Floseal in the management of epistaxis. The SHO’s were then given teaching on how to make up Floseal and a poster including pictures was created. A secondary online survey was performed to re-audit the SHO’s confidence following this intervention. RESULTS: Of the 10 respondents, 3 had previous experience in using Floseal. Pre intervention the average confidence rating on a scale of 1 to 5 (5 – Most confident) in drawing up Floseal was scored at 2. Following teaching and implementation of the new poster the average confidence rating was scored at 4.4 (a 48% increase). From the respondents, 90% expressed that they found the poster useful and that they would also find further teaching on the use of Floseal beneficial in the future. CONCLUSION: Teaching and creation of a clear stepwise poster including photographs improved ENT SHO’s confidence in drawing up Floseal.

Since initiation of the pandemic, identification of characteristics that might influence risk of infection and poor disease outcomes have been of paramount interest. Blood group phenotypes are genetically inherited characteristics whose association with certain infectious diseases have long been debated. The aim of this review is to identify whether a certain type of blood group may influence an individual’s susceptibility to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and developing severe outcomes. Our review shows that blood group O protects individuals against SARS‐CoV‐2, whereas blood group A predisposes them to being infected. Although the association between blood groups and outcomes of COVID‐19 is not consistent, it is speculated that non‐O blood group carriers with COVID‐19 are at higher risk of developing severe outcomes in comparison to O blood group. The interaction between blood groups and SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is hypothesized to be as result of natural antibodies against blood group antigens that may act as a part of innate immune response to neutralize viral particles. Alternatively, blood group antigens could serve as additional receptors for the virus and individuals who are capable of expressing these antigens on epithelial cells, which are known as secretors, would then have a high propensity to be affected by SARS‐CoV‐2.","Shokri, Pourya; Golmohammadi, Saeid; Noori, Maryam; Nejadghaderi, Seyed Aria; Carson‐Chahhoud, Kristin; Safiri, Saeid",Rev Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8209917/,657

This review summarizes the current state of the art for covalent bonding of biomolecules onto solid substrate materials. Early research focused on the use of Au electrodes, with immobilization of biomolecules through ω-functionalized Au-thiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), but stability is usually inadequate due to the weak Au–S bond strength. Other noble substrates such as C, Pt, and Si have also been studied. While their nobility has the advantage of ensuring biocompatibility, it also has the disadvantage of making them relatively unreactive towards covalent bond formation.

Four open-ended questions provided participants with the opportunity to produce unlimited free-text responses regarding their perception of policing during the pandemic. Responses were coded and thematically analysed to identify themes concerning public compliance and policing during the lockdown. Subthemes surrounding communication, efficiency, and equity emerged from participant’s perceptions of what they considered to be ‘satisfactory’ and ‘unsatisfactory’ forms of policing during the pandemic. A common sub-theme regarding the public’s confusion over the role of the police was countered by an acknowledgement that the police were ‘doing their best.’ The pandemic has thrown into sharper relief pre-crisis public perceptions of appropriate policing. The free-text responses highlight the ongoing tensions between normative and instrumental approaches to policing and public expectations of police actions.","Ghaemmaghami, Aram; Inkpen, Rob; Charman, Sarah; Ilett, Camille; Bennett, Stephanie; Smith, Paul; Newiss, Geoff",Policing (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8499964/,657

Physical restraint has been associated with physical injury, but psychological consequences are poorly understood. The aim of this systematic review was to examine physical restraint of children and adolescents in inpatient mental healthcare services. Healthcare databases were searched to identify English language publications discussing anyone aged ≤18 years who had experienced physical restraint as a mental health inpatient. No date restrictions were applied. Sixteen quantitative studies are included within this review. Most studies are retrospective in nature. Publications were appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme quality assessment tool. Common characteristics associated with children and adolescents who experience physical restraint include age, gender, diagnosis, and history. Most studies associate physical restraint with the management of aggression. Findings suggest that it may be a combination of patient (intrinsic) and environmental (extrinsic) factors which ultimately lead to children and adolescents experiencing restraint. This review confirms that little is known about children and adolescents' first-hand experiences of physical restraint. Future research should address children and adolescents' perceptions and first-hand experiences of physical restraint.","Nielson, Simon; Bray, Lucy; Carter, Bernie; Kiernan, Joann",Journal of child health care : for professionals working with children in the hospital and community,https://doi.org/10.1177/1367493520937152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633554/,657
62468,Assessing the role and use of recycled aggregates in the sustainable management of construction and demolition waste via a mini-review and a case study.,2020-01-09,"CONTEXT In medical education, there are often several didactic methods for teaching and learning a specific medical skill. For educators, there are often pragmatic reasons to decide for one or another of them, such as costs, infrastructural requirements, time expenditure, or qualification of the teacher. However, a central aspect to consider is the learning outcome: Does a new method achieve a similar learning success as an established standard method? To answer this question, we need an appropriate method to assess comparability of learning outcomes. METHODS In this paper, we present two essential statistical concepts that can address the issue of comparability of learning outcomes: Equivalence and non-inferiority testing. We explain the ideas behind these concepts and illustrate them with an example data set. To clarify several concepts, we use theoretical examples from one selected field: the teaching and assessment of Basic Life Support (BLS). CONCLUSIONS Equivalence and non-inferiority tests can be powerful tools for comparing teaching and assessment methods. However, their correct application requires adequate knowledge about their strengths, pitfalls, and application fields. The aim of this paper is to deliver this knowledge and to provide clinician researchers with a practical guidance to a successful application of these methods.","Klasen, Martin; Sopka, Saša",Medical education,https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.14420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33206411/,657

66826,Quantitative analysis of residential plastic recycling in New York City.,2021-04-08,"The importance of modulating the intensity of Wnt signaling has been highlighted in various biological models, but their mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found that Ryk-an atypical Wnt receptor with a pseudokinase domain-has a Wnt-modulating effect in bone marrow stromal cells to control hematopoiesis-supporting activities. We first found that Ryk is predominantly expressed in the mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) of the bone marrow (BM) compared with hematopoietic cells. Downregulation of Ryk in MSCs decreased their clonogenic activity and ability to support self-renewing expansion of primitive hematopoietic progenitors (HPCs) in response to canonical Wnt ligands. In contrast, under high concentrations of Wnt, Ryk exerted suppressive effects on the transactivation of target genes and HPC-supporting effects in MSCs, thus fine-tuning the signaling intensity of Wnt in BM stromal cells. This ability of Ryk to modulate the HPC-supporting niche activity of MSCs was abrogated by induction of deletion mutants of Ryk lacking the intracellular domain or extracellular domain, indicating that the pseudokinase-containing intracellular domain mediates the Wnt-modulating effects in response to extracellular Wnt ligands. These findings indicate that the ability of the BM microenvironment to respond to extracellular signals and support hematopoiesis may be fine-tuned by Ryk via modulation of Wnt signaling intensity to coordinate hematopoietic activity.","Jeong, Seon-Yeong; Lyu, Jungmook; Kim, Jin-A; Oh, Il-Hoan",Experimental & molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s12276-020-0477-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724069/,657

A systematic review (1995-2020) of waste management interventions.,2021-01-20,"Altered insight into disease or specific symptoms is a prominent clinical feature of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Understanding the neural bases of insight is crucial to help improve FTD diagnosis, classification and management. A systematic review to explore the neural correlates of altered insight in FTD and associated syndromes was conducted. Insight was fractionated to examine whether altered insight into different neuropsychological/behavioural objects is underpinned by different or compatible neural correlates. 6 databases (Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, BIOSIS and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global) were interrogated between 1980 and August 2019. 15 relevant papers were found out of 660 titles screened. The studies included suggest that different objects of altered insight are associated with distinctive brain areas in FTD. For example, disease unawareness appears to predominantly correlate with right frontal involvement. In contrast, altered insight into social cognition potentially involves, in addition to frontal areas, the temporal gyrus, insula, parahippocampus and amygdala. Impaired insight into memory problems appears to be related to the frontal lobes, postcentral gyrus, parietal cortex and posterior cingulate. These results reflect to a certain extent those observed in other neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and also other brain disorders. Nevertheless, they should be cautiously interpreted due to variability in the methodological aspects used to reach those conclusions. Future work should triangulate different insight assessment approaches and brain imaging techniques to increase the understanding of this highly relevant clinical phenomenon in dementia.","Muñoz-Neira, Carlos; Tedde, Andrea; Coulthard, Elizabeth; Thai, N Jade; Pennington, Catherine",NeuroImage.

APPROACH & RESULTS Patients who were listed with MELD>25 from 2008-2017 were analyzed with intention-to-treat(ITT) basis retrospectively. Patients who had a potential live donor were analyzed as ITT-LDLT whereas those who had none belonged to ITT-deceased donor liver transplantation(ITT-DDLT)group. ITT-overall survival(ITT-OS) was analyzed from the time of listing. 325 patients were listed(ITT-LDLT n=212, ITT-DDLT n=113). The risk of delist/death was lower in the ITT-LDLT group(43.4% vs. 19.8%,P<0.001)while transplant rate was higher in the ITT-LDLT group(78.3% vs. 52.2%,P<0.001). The 5-year ITT-OS were superior in the ITT-LDLT group(72.6% vs. 49.5%,P<0.001) for MELD>25, and for MELD>25 and HRS patients(56% vs. 33.8%,P<0.001). Waitlist mortality was the highest early after listing and the distinct alteration of slope at survival curve showed that the benefits of ITT-LDLT occurred within the first month after listing. Perioperative outcomes and 5-year patient survival were comparable for MELD>25(88% vs. 85.4%,P=0.279) and MELD>25 and HRS patients(77% vs. 76.4%,P=0.701) after LDLT and DDLT respectively. LDLT group has a higher rate of renal recovery by 1-month(77.4% vs. 59.1%,P=0.003) and by 3-month(86.1% vs, 74.5%,P=0.029) while the long-term eGFR was similar between the 2 groups. ITT-LDLT reduced the hazard of mortality(HR=0.387-0.552)across all MELD strata. CONCLUSIONS The ITT-LDLT reduced waitlist mortality and allowed an earlier access to transplant. LDLT in high MELD/HRS patients were feasible, they had similar perioperative outcomes and better renal recovery, while the long-term survival and eGFR were comparable to DDLT. LDLT should be considered for high MELD/HRS patients and the application of LDLT should not be restricted with a MELD cut-off.","Wong, Tiffany Cho-Lam; Yan-Yue Fung, James; Pang, Herbert H; Leung, Calvin Ka-Lam; Li, Hoi-Fan; Sin, Sui-Ling; Ma, Ka-Wing; She, Brian Wong-Hoi; Dai, Jeff Wing-Chiu; Chi-Yan Chan, Albert; Cheung, Tan-To; Lo, Chung-Mau",Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.31584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006772/,657

In this study, we aim to assess the relative technical difficulty and performance benefits of dynamic articulating and pre-bent instruments, either combined with conventional laparoscopic tools or not, during the completion of two basic tasks hands-on simulator. METHODS A total of 20 surgeons were included and performed two basic simulator tasks-coordination and cutting-carried out using four different combinations of LESS-designed and straight conventional laparoscopy instruments. Assessment took place before and after the completion of a 14-week training program. Performance data were objectively analyzed over video recordings with an adapted global rating scale (a-GRS) for performance evaluation, combined with a registry of total trial completion time. RESULTS In the coordination task, the worst performance scores (p < 0.001) and longest completion times (p < 0.001 on first assessment and p < 0.01 on last assessment) were obtained with the two dynamic articulating tip instruments. On the cut trials, no significant differences between the different setups were found in a-GRS scores. The two dynamic articulating tip instruments also constituted the most time-demanding setup on both assessment trials (p < 0.05). The use of two dynamic articulating tip instruments showed significant improvement with training in all measured parameters except for performance in the cut task, in which the increase in a-GRS score was not significant. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that the least adequate instrument set for initiation in LESS surgery is the one that combines two dynamic articulating tip instruments, as this has consistently obtained the worst results in all trials. Further data on more complex tasks and on a complete learning and skills-acquisition program must be obtained to confirm these findings.","Sánchez-Margallo, Francisco Miguel; Matos-Azevedo, Ana Maria; Pérez-Duarte, Francisco Julián; Enciso, Silvia; Martín-Portugués, Idoia Díaz-Guëmes",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3337-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24357421/,657

The aim of the present study was to further document if bilateral knee extension is associated with changes in voluntary activation level assessed by both peripheral nerve electrical stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation. METHODS Fourteen subjects performed unilateral and bilateral knee extensions with both superimposed femoral electrical nerve stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation in order to assess voluntary activation (VAFNES) and cortical voluntary activation (VATMS), respectively. RESULTS There was no difference in MVC force of the tested leg when involved in unilateral and bilateral knee extensions (p=0.87). However, a significantly reduced VAFNES (-2.1±2.4%; p=0.01) and VATMS (-1.6±2.7%; p=0.04) have been evidenced during bilateral knee extension.

71958,The uncertainty of UTCI due to uncertainties in the determination of radiation fluxes derived from measured and observed meteorological data.,2012,"Autoregulation of blood flow is a key feature of the human cerebral vascular system to assure adequate oxygenation and metabolism of the brain under changing physiological conditions. The impact of advanced age and anesthesia on cerebral autoregulation remains unclear. The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of sevoflurane anesthesia on cerebral autoregulation in two different age groups. This is a follow-up analysis of data acquired in a prospective observational cohort study. One hundred thirty-three patients aged 18-40 and ≥65 years scheduled for major noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia were included. Cerebral autoregulation indices, limits, and ranges were compared in young and elderly patient groups. Forty-nine patients (37 %) aged 18-40 years and 84 patients (63 %) aged ≥65 years were included in the study. Age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentrations of sevoflurane were 0.89 ± 0.07 in young and 0.99 ± 0.14 in older subjects (P < 0.001). Effective autoregulation was found in a blood pressure range of 13.8 ± 9.8 mmHg in young and 10.2 ± 8.6 mmHg in older patients (P = 0.079). The lower limit of autoregulation was 66 ± 12 mmHg and 73 ± 14 mmHg in young and older patients, respectively (P = 0.075). The association between sevoflurane concentrations and autoregulatory capacity was similar in both age groups. Our data suggests that the autoregulatory plateau is shortened in both young and older patients under sevoflurane anesthesia with approximately 1 MAC. Lower and upper limits of cerebral blood flow autoregulation, as well as the autoregulatory range, are not influenced by the age of anesthetized patients.

The diagnosis is challenging, as it might mimic an infectious, inflammatory, or metabolic disease. Acrometastasis are most commonly found in patients with lung, gastrointestinal, kidney, and breast cancer. Only 3 cases of cervical cancer associated with hand metastasis have been reported in the literature. PATIENT CONCERNS Herein, we report a 58-year-old patient with locally advanced cervical cancer and recurrence in the right thumb as presentation of widespread disseminated disease. She initially presented with adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix and was treated with concurrent chemoradiation followed by high-dose rate brachytherapy. Six months later, she developed an insidious onset of pain and swelling in the right thumb, erythema, and edema, mimicking cellulitis. DIAGNOSIS A biopsy of the soft tissues of the thumb was performed, and the histopathology indicated metastasis of adenocarcinoma to the bone and soft tissues. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES The patient rejected further treatment and died of progressive disease 4 months after the diagnosis of the recurrence. CONCLUSION Metastases in unusual sites are a diagnostic challenge, and there is no standardized treatment. Timely diagnosis and treatment can improve the prognosis of these patients and might preserve their quality of life.","Gallardo-Alvarado, Lenny; Ramos, Alma Astorga; Perez-Montiel, Delia; Ramirez-Morales, Rebeca; Diaz, Erick; Leon, David Cantu-de",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020897; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629680/,657

One of the major goals in the management of these patients is to prevent rebleeding by securing the aneurysm either surgically or by endovascular means. Endovascular treatment is considered the first line of treatment for intracranial aneurysms; however, wide-neck aneurysms (WNAs) are specifically difficult to treat by endovascular means due to the difficulty in achieving a stable coil mass inside the aneurysm sac. To overcome this problem, assisted endovascular treatment techniques and devices have evolved over the years. Amongst these, stent-assisted coiling (SAC) techniques provide a scaffold for coil embolization. The concept of the stent-assisted technique inspired creative pioneers to invent new tools like the PulseRider (Pulsar Vascular, Inc. CA, USA) and the pCONUS (Phenox GmbH, Germany), which are a great help in managing wide-neck and bifurcation aneurysms. The concept of stent within stents and its related hemodynamic effect has led to the novel development of flow diverters for reconstructing the arterial wall and correcting the hemodynamic disturbances. In this article, we review the stents and stent-like devices currently in practice for the endovascular management of wide-neck and branch intracranial aneurysms.","Khattak, Yasir J; Sibaie, Ayman A; Anwar, Muhammad; Sayani, Raza",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.3420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30542634/,657

However, existing research has largely been generalized to those with relapsing-remitting MS, making it difficult to determine the effectiveness of these interventions in people with progressive MS. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review the evidence related to the effectiveness of fatigue management interventions in reducing the severity and impact of fatigue in people with progressive MS. Methods Six electronic databases (CINAHL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PEDro, ProQuest, and Web of Science Core Collections) were searched for relevant articles up until November 2017. Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies that examined the effects of exercise, behavioral interventions, and rehabilitation on fatigue in people with progressive MS using self-reported fatigue outcome measures were included in this review. Results Eight exercise, two rehabilitation, and two behavioral interventions were investigated in the 13 articles included in this review. Heterogeneous effects were reported between studies, with only two exercise, one behavioral, and two rehabilitation interventions recording significant improvements in postintervention fatigue severity or impact. However, most studies were underpowered, only two used fatigue as the primary outcome, and only one specifically recruited participants with predefined levels of fatigue. Conclusions Evidence from this review is inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of nonpharmacologic interventions in reducing the severity and impact of fatigue in progressive MS populations.

To investigate metabolic effects of SARS-COV-2 infection, we evaluated serum metabolites of COVID-19 patients (n = 33; diagnosed by nucleic acid testing), as compared to COVID-19-negative controls (n = 16). Targeted and untargeted metabolomics analyses identified altered tryptophan metabolism into the kynurenine pathway, which regulates inflammation and immunity. Indeed, these changes in tryptophan metabolism correlated with interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Widespread dysregulation of nitrogen metabolism was also seen in infected patients, with altered levels of most amino acids, along with increased markers of oxidant stress (e.g., methionine sulfoxide, cystine), proteolysis, and renal dysfunction (e.g., creatine, creatinine, polyamines). Increased circulating levels of glucose and free fatty acids were also observed, consistent with altered carbon homeostasis. Interestingly, metabolite levels in these pathways correlated with clinical laboratory markers of inflammation (i.e., IL-6 and C-reactive protein) and renal function (i.e., blood urea nitrogen). In conclusion, this initial observational study identified amino acid and fatty acid metabolism as correlates of COVID-19, providing mechanistic insights, potential markers of clinical severity, and potential therapeutic targets.","Thomas, Tiffany; Stefanoni, Davide; Reisz, Julie A; Nemkov, Travis; Bertolone, Lorenzo; Francis, Richard O; Hudson, Krystalyn E; Zimring, James C; Hansen, Kirk C; Hod, Eldad A; Spitalnik, Steven L; D'Alessandro, Angelo",JCI insight,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.140327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32559180/,657

However, the impact of data augmentation on the development of AI (artificial intelligence) models to address clinical unmet needs has not yet been investigated. In this work, we assess whether the aggregation of real with virtual patient data can improve the performance of the existing risk stratification and disease classification models in two rare clinical domains, namely the primary Sjögren's Syndrome (pSS) and the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), for the first time in the literature. To do so, multivariate approaches, such as, the multivariate normal distribution (MVND), and straightforward ones, such as, the Bayesian networks, the artificial neural networks (ANNs), and the tree ensembles are compared against their performance towards the generation of high-quality virtual data. Both boosting and bagging algorithms, such as, the Gradient boosting trees (XGBoost), the AdaBoost and the Random Forests (RFs) were trained on the augmented data to evaluate the performance improvement for lymphoma classification and HCM risk stratification.

Hemodynamic flow patterns induced by these lesions might be associated with thrombus formation. The aim of our study was to evaluate flow patterns of carotid webs using computational fluid dynamics. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with a carotid web in the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) were selected for hemodynamic evaluation with computational fluid dynamics models based on lumen segmentations obtained from CT angiography scans. Hemodynamic parameters, including the area of recirculation zone, time-averaged wall shear stress, transverse wall shear stress, and the oscillatory shear index, were assessed and compared with the contralateral carotid bifurcation. RESULTS In our study, 9 patients were evaluated. Distal to the carotid webs, recirculation zones were significantly larger compared with the contralateral bifurcation (63 versus 43 mm2, P = .02). In the recirculation zones of the carotid webs and the contralateral carotid bifurcation, time-averaged wall shear stress values were comparable (both: median, 0.27 Pa; P = .30), while transverse wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index values were significantly higher in the recirculation zone of carotid webs (median, 0.25 versus 0.21 Pa; P = .02 and 0.39 versus 0.30 Pa; P = .04). At the minimal lumen area, simulations showed a significantly higher time-averaged wall shear stress in the web compared with the contralateral bifurcation (median, 0.58 versus 0.45 Pa; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS Carotid webs are associated with increased recirculation zones and regional increased wall shear stress metrics that are associated with disturbed flow. These findings suggest that a carotid web might stimulate thrombus formation, which increases the risk of acute ischemic stroke.","Compagne, K C J; Dilba, K; Postema, E J; van Es, A C G M; Emmer, B J; Majoie, C B L M; van Zwam, W H; Dippel, D W J; Wentzel, J J; van der Lugt, A; Gijsen, F J H",AJNR.

DESIGN Cross-sectional data were analyzed using logistic regression and general linear models to assess associations between food security status and food skills, health literacy, and the proportion of meals prepared at home, by gender. SETTING Participants recruited from five Canadian cities (Vancouver (BC), Edmonton (AB), Toronto (ON), Montreal (QB), and Halifax (NS)) completed an online survey. PARTICIPANTS 1,389 men and 1,340 women aged 16-30 years. RESULTS Self-reported food skills were not associated with food security status (P>0.05) among men or women. Compared to those with high health literacy (based on interpretation of a nutrition label), higher odds of food insecurity were observed among men (AOR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.74-3.82 and 1.56, 95% CI: 1.07-2.28), and women (AOR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.48-3.70 and 1.92, 95% CI: 1.34-2.74) with lower health literacy. Women in food-insecure households reported preparing a lower proportion of breakfasts (β= -0.051, 95% CI: -0.085 - -0.017), lunches (β= -0.062, 95% CI: -0.098 - -0.026) and total meals at home (β= -0.041, 95% CI: -0.065 - -0.016). Men and women identifying as Black or Indigenous, reporting financial difficulty, and with lower levels of education had heightened odds of experiencing food insecurity. CONCLUSIONS Findings are consistent with other studies underscoring the financial precarity, rather than lack of food skills, associated with food insecurity. This precarity may reduce opportunities to apply health literacy and undertake meal preparation.","Pepetone, Alexandra; Vanderlee, Lana; White, Christine M; Hammond, David; Kirkpatrick, Sharon I",Public health nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1368980021000719; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33648617/,657

We describe the processes used to make the transition, including development of a safety protocol for patients seen virtually, present clinical volume data before and after the transition, and we describe a range of patient experiences through 3 clinical vignettes. METHODS Using data from the electronic health record, we generated counts of the total number of scheduled and completed appointments between December 2019 and June 2020. We used simple proportions to calculate the completed visit rate. RESULTS Both the absolute number of scheduled appointment and the percent of appointments completed increased with the initiation of virtual care, supporting the acceptability of this modality. Several patients experienced clinical improvements in conjunction with greater engagement, though challenges were also noted. CONCLUSIONS Virtual visits are a practical mode of treatment for adolescent substance use disorders, and more evidence is needed to understand the risks and benefits of this treatment modality.","Levy, Sharon; Deister, Diana; Fantegrossi, John; Green, Leslie; Lunstead, Julie; Martinez, Tamara; Riccardelli, William; Schizer, Miriam; Schram, Jesse; Schram, Patricia; Weitzman, Elissa",Journal of addiction medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34128485/,657

METHODS Seven patients (5 men; mean age 75±11.4 years, range 53-86) suffering from symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis (mean 76% diameter reduction) were treated with the dual layer closed-cell stent without embolic protection. Postdilation was performed in 6 of 7 patients. Two patients were treated in the context of ischemic stroke and concurrent middle cerebral artery occlusion. Mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at admission was 12.8±5. RESULTS All devices were deployed satisfactorily. One wall-adherent thromboembolus in a proximal ICA was covered with the Roadsaver stent in a tandem lesion setting. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) declined from 3.7±0.7 to 2.4±0.8 in hospital, showing an improvement in clinical symptoms. No complications were detected during or after the procedure. The 30-day mRS was 1.7±1.1. At 6 months, ultrasound examination demonstrated patency of stents and the external carotid arteries. CONCLUSION The Roadsaver double layer micromesh stent seems to be safe and effective in the treatment of extracranial ICA stenosis and in the context of tandem lesions in ischemic stroke.

However, there is little knowledge whether these differences are also reflected in the functional structure. This study compared the functional diversity of sessile and mobile invertebrate assemblages that settle over three months on floating vs. non-floating artificial habitats, in two Chilean ports. Using morphological, trophic, behavioral, and life history traits, we found differences between mobile and sessile assemblages regarding the effect of the type of habitat on the functional diversity. Compared to sessile assemblages, a greater functional similarity was observed for mobile assemblages, which suggests that their dispersal capacity enables them to balance the reduced connectivity between settlement structures. No traits, prevailing or selected in one or the other habitat type, was however clearly identified; a result warranting for further studies focusing on more advanced stages of community development.","Figueroa, Naily Nashira; Brante, Antonio; Viard, Frédérique; Leclerc, Jean-Charles",Marine pollution bulletin,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.112844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399279/,657

Cells obtained by reprogramming of the patient's own cells offer ethical and clinical advantages could provide a new source of material for therapeutic applications. Studies to date have shown that only a subset of differentiated cell types can be reprogrammed. Among these, keratinocytes, which are the most abundant proliferating cell type in the epidermis, have gained increasing attention as both donor and target cells for reprogramming and have become a new focus of regenerative medicine. As target cells for the treatment of skin defects, keratinocytes can be differentiated or reprogrammed from embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, fibroblasts, adipose tissue stem cells, and mesenchymal cells. As donor cells, keratinocytes can be reprogrammed or direct reprogrammed into a number of cell types, including induced pluripotent stem cells, neural cells, and Schwann cells. In this review, we discuss recent advances in keratinocyte reprogramming, focusing on the induction methods, potential molecular mechanisms, conversion efficiency, and safety for clinical applications.

Another goal was to understand needs for education of children with IDs about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus) and other infectious diseases. Methods: Surveys, presented in the RedCap system, were administered online. Respondents (n = 498) were recruited through sites and listservs for children with disabilities and individuals with asthma. Respondents answered eight questions about knowledge and education for self-management of asthma for children with physical disabilities and IDs. Respondents answered four questions pertaining to management of coronavirus for children with IDs. Results: Respondents' indicated that it would be easier to educate youth with mild or moderate versus severe levels of disabilities. Children with IDs may not receive the education they need to manage their asthma. When comparing those in different occupations, teachers reported lower knowledge for educating children with IDs about asthma management and coronavirus. Conclusions: Doctors and nurses can develop programs for children with physical disabilities and IDs. Programming for youth with severe impairments is needed and perhaps developmentally appropriate programming for youth with IDs will improve education of youth and, concomitantly improve their self-management of asthma and potentially quality of life.

This study aimed to analyse the Spanish prescribing patterns and the effectiveness of biological (b) disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) available for RA in clinical practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS An observational retrospective study was performed in a teaching hospital, analysing the different combinations of drugs prescribed, real-life effectiveness and reasons for withdrawal. RESULTS In total, 210 patients were included, with 19 different patterns (pharmacological groups alone or in combination) of treatment prescribed. Most patients started their treatment with a conventional synthetic (cs) DMARD alone or in combination with a glucocorticosteroid. Among the initial patterns, treatment with only one csDMARD showed a longer duration. The time to first bDMARD was 6 years. TNF-α inhibitors are the most commonly prescribed drugs as initial biological treatments. The highest percentages of good responses and remissions were achieved with tocilizumab, etanercept and infliximab. The time to remission was also lower with tocilizumab. Lack of response, adverse effects and remission were the main causes of bDMARD withdrawal. The duration of treatments until withdrawal was similar among bDMARDs, except for rituximab, for which the duration was slightly shorter. CONCLUSIONS Prescribing pattern analysis showed the highest responses and remission rates with tocilizumab and TNF-α inhibitors. The main reasons for withdrawal were lack of response and adverse effects.

There is ongoing evidence that exposure to PCB153 may influence gut microbiota health and increase the risk of host health. It is needed to illuminate whether there are associations between gut microbiota dysregulation and PCB153-induced host diseases. Importantly, it is urgently needed to find specific strains as biomarkers to monitor PCB153 pollution and associated disorders. The work aims to investigate the change of gut microbiota composition, structure and diversity and various host physiological indexes, to ravel the chain causality of PCB153, gut microbiota health and host health, and to find potential gut microbiota markers for PCB153 pollution. Here, adult female mice were administrated with PCB153. Obtained results indicated that PCB153 led to gut microbiota health deterioration. PCB153 exposure also induced obesity, hepatic lipid accumulation, abdominal adipose tissue depots and dyslipidemia in mice. Furthermore, specific gut microbiota significantly correlated with the host health indexes. This work provides support for the relationship between gut microbiota aberrance derived from PCB153 and risk of host health, and offers some indications of possible indicative functions of gut microbiota on PCB153 pollution.","Min, Lingli; Chi, Yulang; Dong, Sijun",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888612/,657

Pulmonary rehabilitation includes airway clearance techniques, exercise training, education and behaviour change and can improve patients' exercise capacity, muscle strength, quality of life and nutritional status. Airway clearance techniques have beneficial effects for clearing mucous. Over the past years, evidence for the beneficial effects of exercise training on exercise capacity and overall lung health is growing. In cystic fibrosis, multiple factors result in reduced exercise capacity. All modalities of pulmonary rehabilitation should be offered to patients with cystic fibrosis, as the benefits in most cases outweigh the risks, though the optimal regimens need to be yet defined.","Kalamara, Evgenia I; Ballas, Evangelos T; Pitsiou, Georgia; Petrova, Guergana",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2021.1501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33792230/,657

METHODS Cases of aneurysms arising in the paraclinoid location of the internal carotid artery treated with intracranial stents and/or bare platinum coils were analyzed retrospectively from our prospectively collected database. We identified 70 aneurysms treated with stent assistance (including one stenting-alone case) and 24 aneurysms treated with coiling alone. Stenting-assisted coiling was achieved either as a one-time treatment or as a two-step maneuver with the stent placed several weeks before coiling, or stent-assisted coiling was used as a second maneuver in aneurysms that recanalized after previous coiling. RESULTS In aneurysms treated with stent assistance, 60% had ≥95% occlusion at treatment completion, a result comparing favorably with the 54.2% rate of ≥95% occlusion associated with coiling alone. At last follow-up, 60 aneurysms treated with stent assistance had a 66.7% incidence of ≥95% occlusion, with no in-stent stenosis; 75% of patients treated with coiling alone had ≥95% aneurysm occlusion. Thrombus occurred during stent deployment in two patients, one with and one without neurologic sequelae; stent displacement occurred in one patient without neurologic sequelae. At last follow-up, 57 of 62 patients (91.9%) treated with stent-assisted coiling experienced excellent/good outcomes (modified Rankin scale score ≤2). These results compared favorably with those for the coiling-alone group in which 23 of 24 (95.8%) had good outcomes.

148430,Management of plastic waste: A bibliometric mapping and analysis.,2021-02-24,"Permanent supportive housing (PSH), which combines affordable public housing with social services, has become the dominant model in the U.S. for providing housing to formerly homeless people. PSH has been effective in reducing re-entry to homelessness, yet has shown limited evidence of improving formerly homeless individuals' mental health and quality of life. This study aimed to understand the lived experiences of formerly homeless adults' adjustment to tenancy in PSH, with a focus on how living in PSH has affected their meaningful activity and social engagement. Based on a phenomenological approach, a thematic analysis was conducted using semi-structured interviews with 17 individuals living in three PSH buildings in New York City. Results suggested that PSH was beneficial in fulfilling formerly homeless individual's basic needs and facilitating lifestyle improvements, yet many were dissatisfied with their living conditions and lacked meaningful activity, social integration, and community belongingness. These issues were found to develop in part as a result of formerly homeless individuals' disharmonious relationships within the social context of PSH, consisting of staff members, other residents, and people in the surrounding community. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and implications for PSH social services are discussed. This article is protected by copyright.

150269,"Generation, collection and transportation, disposal and recycling of kitchen waste: a case study in Shanghai.",2014,"OBJECTIVE The ideal location of specimen extraction in laparoscopic-assisted colorectal surgery is still debatable. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of incisional hernias and surgical site infections in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic resection for recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis by performing specimen extraction through left lower transverse incision or Pfannenstiel-Kerr incision. METHODS A total of 269 patients operated between January 2014 and December 2017 were retrospectively screened for inclusion in the study. Patients with specimen extraction through left lower transverse incision (LLT) and patients with specimen extraction through Pfannenstiel-K incision (P-K) were matched in 1:1 proportion regarding age, sex, comorbidities, and previous abdominal surgery. The incidence of incisional hernias and surgical site infections were compared by using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS After matching 77 patients in the LLT group and 77 patients in the P-K group, they were found to be homogenous regarding the above mentioned descriptive characteristics. No patients in the P-K group developed an incisional hernia compared with 10 patients (13%) in the LLT group (p = 0.001). All these patients required hernia repair with mesh augmentation. The rate of surgical site infections was 1/77 in the P-K group and 0/77 in the LLT group (p = 1.0). In the P-K group, a wound protector was used in 86% of patients whereas in the LLT group, 39% of the wounds were protected during specimen extraction (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION The Pfannenstiel-Kerr incision may be the preferred extraction site compared with the left lower transverse incision given the significant reduction of the risk of incisional hernias.","Varathan, N; Rotigliano, N; Nocera, F; Tampakis, A; Füglistaler, I; von Flüe, M; Steinemann, D C; Posabella, A",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-019-03444-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31823052/,657
155288,"Characterization of bottom ash from two hospital waste incinerators in Rabat, Morocco.",2013,"Since its first description around the year 2000, the local renin angiotensin system (RAS) in skin has been subject of an increasing number of studies with many additions over the last two to three years. A focus of research has been investigations on the role of cutaneous angiotensin receptors and locally synthesised angiotensin II in wound healing, in dermatoses associated with skin fibrosis and in melanoma. This review will provide an introduction into the RAS with emphasis on information relevant for the cutaneous RAS. It will discuss the role of the RAS in skin physiology, followed by a detailed review of the existing literature addressing the role of local angiotensin II and angiotensin AT1 - and AT2 -receptors in wound healing and in various skin diseases such as hypertrophic scars/keloids, scleroderma, dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, Dupuytren's disease, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and psoriasis. In a final section, the potential relevance of drugs, which interfere with the RAS, for future therapy of dermatological disorders is discussed. Collectively, research about the RAS in skin can currently be described as an area, which has gained increasing attention by basic researchers, thus resulting in a multitude of preclinical studies pointing to the potential relevance of components of the RAS as drug targets in dermatological diseases. With a few small clinical studies already performed successfully for indications such as hypertrophic scars and keloids, it can be said that the skin RAS is now in the critical phase of translation from preclinical evidence to clinical use.","Silva, Igor Maciel Souza; Assersen, Kasper Bostlund; Willadsen, Natalie Nanette; Jepsen, Julie; Artuc, Metin; Steckelings, Ulrike Muscha",Experimental dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/exd.14159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32697884/,657

We aimed to provide an evidence-based clinical practice guideline (CPG) with internationally harmonized CRF surveillance recommendations for CAYA cancer survivors diagnosed < 30 years. METHODS This CPG was developed by a multidisciplinary panel under the umbrella of the International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group. After evaluating concordances and discordances of four existing CPGs, we performed systematic literature searches. We screened articles for eligibility, assessed quality, extracted, and summarized the data from included articles. We formulated recommendations based on the evidence and clinical judgment. RESULTS Of 3647 articles identified, 70 articles from 14 countries were included. The prevalence of CRF in CAYA cancer survivors ranged from 10-85%. We recommend that healthcare providers are aware of the risk of CRF, implement regular screening with validated measures, and recommend effective interventions to fatigued survivors. CONCLUSIONS A considerable proportion of CAYA cancer survivors suffers from CRF even years after the end of treatment.

Due to its high infectiousness, the health care staff is even more exposed. Nevertheless, there is still very limited information about it, especially among pediatricians. OBJECTIVE To assess the seroprevalence of SARSCoV- 2 antibodies among physicians from a children's hospital 3 months after the first case in Argentina. To explore if certain demographic, occupational, and epidemiological characteristics are risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. METHODS Cross-sectional study of physicians randomly selected from the list of workers of a children's hospital. All of them were screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by chemiluminescence (immunoglobulins G/M [IgG/IgM]) and their epidemiological history was collected (age, place of residence, professional category, contact with infected people) in order to explore the association between predictors and seropositivity. RESULTS A total of 116 physicians were included; their average age was 45.6 ± 13.3 years. Of them, 62.9 % were staff physicians, and the rest, residents; 42.2 % worked in areas designated for direct care of COVID-19 patients. Four (3.5 %) referred contact with infected people without the appropriate protection, and 6 (5.2 %), having traveled to risk areas. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG) were only detected in one of the professionals. Because of this, it was impossible to assess the association between potential predictors and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. CONCLUSION It was observed that only 0.9 % of the physicians from a children's hospital had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Insúa, Claudia; Stedile, Graciela; Figueroa, Verónica; Hernández, Claudia; Svartz, Alejandra; Ferrero, Fernando; Ossorio, María F; Brunetto, Oscar",Archivos argentinos de pediatria,https://doi.org/10.5546/aap.2020.eng.381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33231044/,657
162555,Detection of Asthma Inflammatory Phenotypes Using Artificial Neural Network,2021,"UNLABELLED * OBJECTIVE Patients with potentially premalignant neoplastic pancreatic cysts without high-risk stigmata usually enter a surveillance program. Data on outcomes of such surveillance programs are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the resection rate and malignancy rate during follow-up. MATERIAL AND METHODS From our prospective database (2006-2015) of patients with pancreatic cysts, we analyzed patients with pancreatic cysts without high-risk stigmata with at least six months follow-up. RESULTS In total, 146 patients were followed for a median of 29 months (IQR 13.5-50 months). In 124 patients (84.9%), no changes in clinical or imaging characteristics occurred during follow-up. Thirteen patients (8.9%) developed an indication for surgery after a median follow-up of 25 months (IQR 12-42 months). Two patients did not undergo surgery because of comorbidity, 11 patients (7.5%) underwent resection. Indications for surgery were symptoms (n = 2), development of a pancreatic mass (n = 1), a new nodule (n = 2), thickened cyst wall (n = 1), pancreatic duct dilation (n = 3), and/or suspicion of mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) (n = 3). Postoperative histology showed one pancreatic malignancy not originating from the cyst, three mixed type-intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), one side branch-IPMN, two MCN, one neuroendocrine tumor, one serous cystadenoma, one inflammatory cyst, and one lymphangioma. The highest grade of cyst dysplasia was borderline dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS Most neoplastic pancreatic cysts without high-risk stigmata at initial presentation show no substantial change during 1-4-year follow-up. Only 7.5% of patients underwent surgery and less than 1% of patients developed pancreatic malignancy. This indicates that additional markers are needed to tailor treatment of pancreatic cysts.","Lekkerkerker, Selma J; Besselink, Marc G; Busch, Olivier R; Dijk, Frederike; Engelbrecht, Marc R; Rauws, Erik A; Fockens, Paul; van Hooft, Jeanin E",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1080/00365521.2016.1179338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27175891/,657

Subsequently, a variety of derivatives of this chemotype were synthesized to develop structure-activity relationships, and all are inhibitors of the BoNT/A LC. Three-dimensional analyses indicated that half of the originally discovered 1,7-DAAC structure superimposed well with 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline-based antimalarial agents. This observation led to the discovery that several of the 1,7-DAAC derivatives are potent in vitro inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum and, in general, are more efficacious against CQ-resistant strains than against CQ-susceptible strains. In addition, by inhibiting β-hematin formation, the most efficacious 1,7-DAAC-based antimalarials employ a mechanism of action analogous to that of 4,7-ACQ-based antimalarials and are well tolerated by normal cells. One candidate was also effective when administered orally in a rodent-based malaria model. Finally, the 1,7-DAAC-based derivatives were examined for Ebola filovirus inhibition in an assay employing Vero76 cells, and three provided promising antiviral activities and acceptably low toxicities.","Opsenica, Igor; Burnett, James C; Gussio, Rick; Opsenica, Dejan; Todorović, Nina; Lanteri, Charlotte A; Sciotti, Richard J; Gettayacamin, Montip; Basilico, Nicoletta; Taramelli, Donatella; Nuss, Jonathan E; Wanner, Laura; Panchal, Rekha G; Solaja, Bogdan A; Bavari, Sina",Journal of medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/jm100938u; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21265542/,657

Strategic foresight and scenario planning are introduced as an approach to anticipate disruptions in the complex adaptive travel and tourism system. Findings: As COVID-19 has demonstrated, travel and tourism is sensitive for disruptions from the outside. To ensure long-term resilience and sustainability, a systems approach embedded in strategic foresight and scenario planning is emphasised. Practical implications: Strategic foresight and scenario planning is a competence that can be learned. Originality/value: Given the present status of COVID-19 and other disruptors on travel and tourism, a resilient approach to the future is necessary;thus, the value of this viewpoint paper is the proposition of an adaptive capacity system.

However, a comprehensive picture of antigen-specific B cell responses, differentiation, clonal proliferation and dynamics in different organs after infection is lacking. Here, we combined single-cell RNA sequencing with single-cell B cell receptor (BCR) characterization of antigen-specific cells in the draining lymph nodes, spleen and lungs after influenza infection. We identify several novel B cell subpopulations forming after infection and find organ-specific differences that persist over the course of the response. We discover important transcriptional differences between memory cells in lungs and lymphoid organs and describe organ-restricted clonal expansion. Strikingly, by combining BCR mutational analysis, monoclonal antibody expression and affinity measurements we find no differences between germinal center (GC)-derived memory and plasmacells, at odds with an affinity-based selection model. By linking antigen-recognition with transcriptional programming, clonal-proliferation and differentiation, these finding provide important advances in our understanding of antiviral B cell immunity.","Mathew, Nimitha R.; Jayanthan, Jayalal K.; Smirnov, Ilya; Robinson, Jonathan L.; Axelsson, Hannes; Nakka, Sravya S.; Emmanouilidi, Aikaterini; Czarnewski, Paulo; Yewdell, William T.; Lebrero-Fernández, Cristina; Bernasconi, Valentina; Harandi, Ali M.; Lycke, Nils; Borcherding, Nicholas; Yewdell, Jonathan W.; Greiff, Victor; Bemark, Mats; Angeletti, Davide",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.24.264069,657

While analyzing sex as a biological variable is widely mandated, gender as a sociocultural variable is not, largely because the field lacks quantitative tools for analyzing the influence of gender on health outcomes. We conducted a comprehensive review of English-language measures of gender from 1975 to 2015 to identify variables across three domains: gender norms, gender-related traits, and gender relations. This yielded 11 variables tested with 44 items in three US cross-sectional survey populations: two internet-based (N= 2,051; N= 2,135) and a patient-research registry (N= 489), conducted between May 2017 and January 2018.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns have been raised regarding the risk of infection to both healthcare staff and patients during gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures. Given the im-portance of performing routine endoscopic procedures to an individual’s future health, we sought to estimate the risk of COVID-19 infection for healthcare staff and patients undergoing endoscopic studies at an ambulatory endoscopy center during the pandemic. Material and Methods. This is a prospective(and) analytical cohort study conducted in an ambulatory gastroenterology center located in the Au-tonomous City of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Patients undergoing different endoscopic procedures were evaluated for COVID-19 between April 14 and August 31, 2020. COVID-19 was also evaluated in all healthcare and associated staff during the same time period. The risk (cumu-lative incidence) of acquiring COVID-19 in all patients and staff was calculated. Results. Between April 14 and August 31, 2020, procedures were performed in 3,745 patients with a mean age of 51.12 years;2,102 (56.18%) were male and 1,643 (43.82%) were female. Follow-up was completed in 3,492 patients, 18 of whom tested positive for COVID-19 standing for an incidence of 0.52% (95%CI 0.31 – 0.81%). Six (5.45%) out of 110 staff members were infected with COVID-19 (1 endoscopist, 4 endoscopy assistants and 1 administrative staff member). In this group, the incidence of positive tests for COVID-19 was 5.45% (95%CI: 2.03 – 11.50%). The increased rates of positive cases among our patients and healthcare professionals were respectively 7.9 and 23.6 times lower than in general pop-ulation. Conclusion. During the study period, the propor-tion of COVID-19 infections in our ambulatory specialized in gastrointestinal endoscopy was low and much lower than that in the general population for both patients and health-care professionals. Endoscopic procedures undertaken at this center were low risk, likely due to strict compliance with es-tablished pandemic protocols.

Undiagnosed and untreated disease is associated with short- and long-term complications. Treatment with a gluten-free diet results in health improvement. The current health care approach is unable to solve the underdiagnosis of CD and timely diagnosis and treatment is only achieved by active case finding. Aim of this study is to perform a novel case-finding project to detect CD in 12 months-4 years old symptomatic children who visit the YHCCs in a well-described region in the Netherlands to show that it is feasible, cost-effective and well accepted by the population. Methods/analysis: Prospective intervention cohort study. Parents of all children aged 12 months-4 years attending the Youth Health Care Centres (YHCCs) for a regular visit are asked if their child has one or more CD-related symptoms from a standardized list. If so, they will be invited to participate in the case-finding study. After informed consent, a point of care test (POC) to assess CD-specific antibodies against tissue-transglutaminase (TG2A) from a droplet of blood, is performed onsite at the YHCCs. If the POC test is positive, CD is highly suspected and the child will be referred to hospital for definitive diagnosis according to the ESPGHAN guideline. Main outcomes: 1. incidence rate of new CD diagnoses in the study region Kennemerland in comparison to the rest of the Netherlands. 2. Feasibility and cost-effectiveness of active case-finding for CD in the YHCCs. All costs of active case finding, diagnostics and treatment of CD and the potential short and long term consequences of the disease will be calculated for the setting with and without case finding. 3. Ethical acceptability: by questionnaires on parental and health care professionals satisfaction. A statistical analysis plan (SAP) has been written and will be published on the GLUTENSCREEN website. Ethics and dissemination: The Medical Ethics Committee Leiden approved this study.

Many researchers are working continuously to find effective drug treatments for COVID-19;however, the optimal treatment approach remains unclear. In this article, current advances in pharmacological treatments for patients with COVID-19 are discussed. Data obtained from recent studies indicate a mortality benefit with the administration of dexamethasone or adjunctive tocilizumab and potential clinical benefits with remdesivir (with or without baricitinib). Several monoclonal antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have been developed.

The pathogenesis of COVID-19 indicates that antiviral treatments would be most beneficial in the early phase of the infection that is primarily driven by replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory therapies are likely to be more beneficial during the late phase of the infection, when the disease is driven by an exaggerated immune/inflammatory response to the virus that causes tissue damage.","Kim, S.

Children with special needs are socially, financially, and educationally impacted by dramatic changes to laws and restrictions put in place to curtail this devastating global pandemic. This study addresses the beneficial improvements that occurred in the lives of children with special needs during the quarantine period. It led to improved skills, better family dynamics, and an enhancement in technological expertise. Here, we use the case study approach. Twelve parents of children with special needs were selected from the Kozhikode district of Kerala, India. Convenient sampling methods were used for the selection of respondents. The data obtained from the twelve participants were scrutinized. The verbatims were coded with the QDA-Miner Software. Our findings indicate that the lockdown has reinforced family bonds;opened up spaces for homeschooling and digital learning;strengthened relationships with parents, communities, and teachers;and paved the way for technological adaptation. During lockdown, children with special needs continued to learn and build skills in a nurturing familial environment. © Authors.","Vincent, R.; Nalini, R.; Krishnakumar, K.","International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research",https://doi.org/10.26803/ijlter.20.7.12,657

There are no US Food and Drugs Administration (USFDA)-approved antiviral drugs or vaccines that could be used to prevent or treat this viral infection. However, several clinical trials are ongoing, searching for therapeutic alternatives. As time is crucial in a pandemic, the scientific community has used drug repurposing and data obtained from in silico models to identify possible lead compound inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. Direct-acting antivirals are the most promising tools to control viral infections. One of the targets for direct-acting antivirals is the main protease (Mpro), a key enzyme in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. This protease is a cysteine protease that shares high homology with the SARS-CoV Mpro and could be susceptible to blocking its activity by compounds such as HIV protease inhibitors. In this book chapter, we focused on the structural features of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro that could be applied to developing new therapies using computational aid, although it is not certain whether the outcomes of such computational studies will immediately result in effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.","Ortega, J.

However, few studies have directly examined the effect of COVID-19 vaccines on transmission. We quantified the effectiveness of vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA-based vaccine) against household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Israel. We fit two time-to-event models - a mechanistic transmission model and a regression model - to estimate vaccine effectiveness against susceptibility to infection and infectiousness given infection in household settings. Vaccine effectiveness against susceptibility to infection was 80-88%. For breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals, the vaccine effectiveness against infectiousness was 41-79%. The overall vaccine effectiveness against transmission was 88.5%. Vaccination provides substantial protection against susceptibility to infection and slightly lower protection against infectiousness given infection, thereby reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to household contacts.","Prunas, O.; Warren, J.

Drawing upon collaborative research in England and Scotland and interviews with commissioners and support organisations, we show how landscapes of care and support are unstable and fragmented. We identify how pressures of time, resource and precaritisation in the workforce are creating 'debilitating landscapes of care' that further erode the capacities of both the people that work in the sector and people with learning disabilities. Some challenges that people with learning disabilities face in this context include finding appropriate local support, narrowing access as a result of reductions in benefit entitlements and identifying quality providers amid a complex array of private and charitable provision. Capacity to cope with these challenges is contingent on access to quality advocacy, supportive family, friendships, productive occupational learning environments and peer support, but these are not always available. The impact of COVID-19 has only served to intensify some of the issues we identify and the urgent need for a response.

In a well-controlled animal model of infection, we sought to determine if one could predict lethality using transcriptional information obtained from whole blood early after influenza virus exposure. We started with publicly available transcriptomic data from the lung, which is the primary site of the infection and pathology, to derive a multigene transcriptional signature of death reflective of innate inflammation associated with tissue damage. We refined this affected tissue signature with data from infected mouse and human blood to develop and validate a machine learning model that can robustly predict survival in mice after IAV challenge using data obtained from as little as 10 μl of blood from early time points post infection. Furthermore, in genetically identical, cohoused mice infected with the same viral bolus, the same model can predict the lethality of individual animals but, intriguingly, only within a specific time window that overlapped with the early effector phase of adaptive immunity. These findings raise the possibility of predicting disease outcome in respiratory virus infections with blood transcriptional data and pave the way for translating such approaches to humans.","Milanez-Almeida, Pedro; Martins, Andrew J.; Torabi-Parizi, Parizad; Franco, Luis M.; Tsang, John S.; Germain, Ronald N.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.27.357053,657

Downsizing, job shortages, and unemployment are among the significant effects. The markets are supported by the need to train and educate our youth to be job producers rather than job seekers. This study sought to investigate the role of universities in the formation of students’ attitudes toward entrepreneurship by analyzing the influence of locus of control, extracurricular activities, and curriculum on entrepreneurial intention among Pakistani university students. This study collected data from 536 students across 15 universities in Pakistan through a weblink questionnaire. SPSS and AMOS were used to test the theoretical model. Results confirmed that locus of control positively affects entrepreneurial intentions and is the strongest predictor among the other two variables. Extracurricular activities positively affect entrepreneurial intentions, and curriculum is also positively affecting entrepreneurial intentions. This study concluded that entrepreneurial education and acquaintance are essential in bringing entrepreneurial intentions among students. Locus of control is found to be the most substantial element in developing entrepreneurial intentions among students. Educational institutions can play a critical role by proactively contributing through their efficient and proficient curricula, professional and experienced teachers, and locus of control by combining curricular and co-curricular activities. © Copyright © 2021 Li, Pervaiz and He.","Li, G.; Pervaiz, S.; He, Q.",Frontiers in Education,https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2021.717532,657

Participant authenticity, data integrity, and access control are the assurance to online examination. The existing online examination schemes cannot provide the protection of biometric features and fine-grained access control. Particularly, they did not discuss how to resolve some disputes among students, teachers, and a platform in a fair and reasonable way. We propose a novel biometric authentication and blockchain-based online examination scheme. The examination data are encrypted to store in a distributed system, which can be obtained only if the user satisfies decryption policy. And the pieces of evidence are recorded in a blockchain network which is jointly established by some credible institutions. Unlike other examination authentication systems, face templates in our scheme are protected using a fuzzy vault and a cryptographic method. Furthermore, educational administrative department can determine who the real initiator of malicious behavior is when a dispute arises using a dispute determination protocol. Analysis shows that no central authority is required in our scheme;the collusion of multiple users cannot obtain more data;even if the authorities compromise, biometric features of each user will not be leaked. Therefore, in terms of privacy-preserving biometric templates, fine-grained access, and dispute resolution, it is superior to the existing schemes.

Applying this algorithm to an independent test set of 162 patients from a screening trial shows a precision of 0.90 for identifying short-segment disease.

It is critical that personal protective equipment (PPE) used to protect healthcare workers be safe and effective in meeting labeled performance claims for barrier resistance to deadly viruses such as Ebola (Zaire ebolavirus) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The aim of this study is to develop a readily reproducible and standardized simulated use test for gown and drape materials using a blood test soil to evaluate the ability of the materials to prevent penetration of clinically relevant test soils at clinically relevant pressures. We designed and constructed a simulated use ""elbow lean""apparatus based on the apparatus in ASTM F1819, Standard Test Method for Resistance of Materials Used in Protective Clothing to Penetration by Synthetic Blood Using a Mechanical Pressure Technique, that applies a physiologically relevant load to PPE material. We developed a test protocol for our proposed method and used the apparatus on a variety of PPE materials to assess penetration of a blood test soil. The testing demonstrated that the new apparatus can be used to assess penetration of a blood test soil through PPE materials under conditions that are more clinically relevant than those in ASTM F1670, Standard Test Method for Resistance of Materials Used in Protective Clothing to Penetration by Synthetic Blood, and ASTM F1671, Standard Test Method for Resistance of Materials Used in Protective Clothing to Penetration by Blood-Borne Pathogens Using Phi-X174 Bacteriophage Penetration as a Test System.

168874,Deploying a Speech Therapy Game Using a Deep Neural Network Sibilant Consonants Classifier,2021,"We investigate how the outbreak of epidemics can affect host governments' targeting of refugees and violation of their physical integrity rights. We argue that governments target repression against refugees for two reasons. First, refugees are easily scapegoated for the arrival of epidemics at a time when governments are looking to shift the blame for their own poor performance. Second, crises provide circumstances for governments to engage in opportunistic repression to further their goal of coercing existing refugees to depart and deterring new refugees from arriving. Drawing upon a global dataset of countries for the years 1996 to 2015, we demonstrate that epidemic outbreaks do indeed increase the likelihood and scale of government repression targeting refugee populations. These effects are especially pronounced in countries with higher proportions of refugees hosted and in less democratic countries. Identification of this potential for government repression of refugees during epidemics is important in light of the grave scale of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest the international community should be vigilant for signs of governments' mistreatment of vulnerable refugee populations to shift focus away from their own poor handling of crises such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and opportunistically advance their goal of reducing the numbers of refugees hosted locally. © The Author(s), 2021.

Additionally, the loss of olfactory function often precedes the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. Chemical ablation of olfactory sensory neurons blocks the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the cribriform plate and alters normal CSF production and/or circulation. Damage to this drainage pathway could contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases and could link olfactory sensory neuron health and neurodegeneration. Here, we investigated the impact of intranasal treatment of combustion products (laboratory-generated soots) and their oxygen functionalized derivatives on mouse olfactory sensory neurons, olfactory nerve cell progenitors, and the behavior of the mouse. We found that after a month of every-other-day intranasal treatment of soots, there was minimal effect on olfactory sensory neuron anatomy or exploratory behavior in the mouse. However, oxygen-functionalized soot caused a large decrease in globose basal cells, which are olfactory progenitor cells. These results suggest that exposure to air pollution damages the olfactory neuron progenitor cells, and could lead to decreases in the number of olfactory neurons, potentially disrupting CSF drainage.","Norwood, Jordan N.; Gharpure, Akshay P.; Kumal, Raju; Turner, Kevin L.; Pistone, Lauren Ferrer; Vander Wal, Randy; Drew, Patrick J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.19.256297,657

As a result, recombinant Env glycoproteins generally elicit inadequate antibody levels that neutralize clinically-relevant, neutralization-resistant (Tier-2) HIV-1 strains. Multivalent antigen presentation on nanoparticles is an established strategy to increase vaccine-driven immune responses. However, due to nanoparticle instability in vivo, the display of non-native Env structures, and the inaccessibility of many neutralizing antibody (NAb) epitopes, the effects of nanoparticle display have been modest for Env trimers. Here, we generated two-component self-assembling protein nanoparticles presenting twenty SOSIP trimers of the clade C Tier-2 genotype 16055. An immunization study in rabbits demonstrated that these nanoparticles induced 60-fold higher autologous Tier-2 NAb titers than the corresponding SOSIP trimers.

SPATA22, along with its direct binding partner and functional collaborator, MEIOB, is essential for the proper repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) during meiotic recombination. Here we describe a novel point-mutated allele (shani) of mouse Spata22 that we isolated in a forward genetic screen. shani mutant mice phenocopy Spata22-null and Meiob-null mice: mutant cells appear to form DSBs and initiate meiotic recombination, but are unable to complete DSB repair, leading to meiotic prophase arrest, apoptosis and sterility. shani mutants show precocious loss of DMC1 foci and improper accumulation of BLM-positive recombination foci, reinforcing the requirement of SPATA22-MEIOB for the proper progression of meiotic recombination events. The shani mutation lies within a Spata22 coding exon and molecular characterization shows that it leads to incorrect splicing of the Spata22 mRNA, ultimately resulting in no detectable SPATA22 protein. We propose that the shani mutation alters an exonic splicing enhancer element (ESE) within the Spata22 transcript. The affected DNA nucleotide is conserved in most tetrapods examined, suggesting that the splicing regulation we describe here may be a conserved feature of Spata22 regulation.","Petrillo, Cynthia; Barroca, Vilma; Ribeiro, Jonathan; Lailler, Nathalie; Livera, Gabriel; Keeney, Scott; Martini, Emmanuelle; Jain, Devanshi",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.934042,657

In the following days, media reports showed that consumers increasingly stockpiled groceries and household supplies. Interestingly, behavioral data shows that this stockpiling exhibited considerable heterogeneity across countries. Building on cultural dimension theory, the authors theorize that this heterogeneity can be explained by countries' cultural values: Consumer stockpiling after the WHO's announcement was more pronounced in countries whose residents show high uncertainty avoidance, low long-term orientation, low indulgence, and high individualism. The authors confirm these propositions using global mobility data from Google matched with country-level data on cultural values, pandemic reaction policies, and other key variables. This research note thereby integrates the previously disconnected literature on cultural dimension theory and consumer stockpiling in general, as well as providing new and significant knowledge about cross-cultural consumer behavior in crises. Furthermore, the authors provide actionable insights for international policymakers and business managers who aim to predict or control consumer stockpiling in future global crises, in order to enhance consumer well-being.","Ahmadi, Iman Habel Johannes Jia Miaolei Lee Nick Wei Sarah",Journal of International Marketing,https://doi.org/10.1177/1069031x211037590,657

Parasites are efficient immune modulators because their ability to stimulate an immune response in infected persons. AIM: This study aims to detect if there is a probable relationship between intestinal parasitic infections and COVID-19. METHODS: Ninety patients consulted at Al-Kindy Teaching Hospital (Al-Shifa center) from October 2020 till April 2021, confirmed infection with COVID-19 by PCR. Stool examination was done for detecting intestinal parasites. RESULTS: From 90 patients, males were 63 (70%), with median age 32 years, while females were 27 (30%), with age 24–44 years. Asymptomatic patients were 8.1 (9%), patients with moderate symptoms 22.5 (25%) cases, while the rest were 59.4 (66%) cases who required enter to the intensive care unit, with symptoms including cough (80%), dyspnea (74%), fever (56%), headache (43%), chest pain (37%), sore throat (35%), myalgia (32%), diarrhea (27%), and hemoptysis (3%). CONCLUSION: There is inverse relationship between parasitic infection and COVID-19 infections, and it is significant to understand the action between parasites and microbiome, also its function in COVID-19 pathogenicity.","Abd Al-Khaliq, I.; Mahdi, I.; Nasser, A.",Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3889/oamjms.2021.6622,657

Many facts still remain hidden, mainly why certain patients develop complications with serious tissue damage and whether it causes a permanent organ impairment. If and when will fibrosis develop in COVID-19 pneumonia requires further research, but a link between the amount of tissue afflicted and the development of fibrosis exists. Case outline A previously healthy, non-smoker, woman with minor symptoms on admission had suddenly developed a serious respiratory insufficiency and whose radiographic finding on computed tomography scan had shown a serious progression with the development of fibrosis in a matter of days. The exact mechanism and correlation of this clinical course remains unknown;however, it is clear that the pulmonary fibrosis is caused by COVID-19 pneumonia. Follow-up computed tomography scan, performed 50 days after initial symptoms, had shown a partial regression of consolidations and post-inflammatory fibrosis. Conclusion Pulmonary fibrosis is the most severe complication of COVID-19 infection on the respiratory system. Who, when or if a patient will develop any complication is still unclear, as well as whether these changes are reversible? Also, the number of recovered patients who later develop some chronic complications remains to be seen.","Stjepanovic, M.; Belic, S.; Buha, I.; Maric, N.; Baralic, M.; Mihailovic-Vucinic, V.",Srpski Arhiv Za Celokupno Lekarstvo,https://doi.org/10.2298/sarh200818045s,657

Design: Research on research study. Data source: All cohort or longitudinal studies describing an exposure-outcome relationship published in The BMJ during 2018. We also had access to the submitted papers and reviewer reports. Main outcome measures: Proportion of published research papers with 'inconsistent' use of causal language in the abstract. Papers where language was consistently causal or non-causal were classified as 'consistently causal' or 'consistently not causal', respectively; those where causality may be inferred were classified as 'suggests causal'. For the 'inconsistent' papers, we then compared the published and submitted version. Results: Of 151 published research papers, 60 described eligible studies. Of these 60, we classified the causal language used as 'consistently causal' (13%), 'suggests causal' (35%), 'inconsistent' (20%) and 'consistently not causal'(32%). The majority of the 'Inconsistent' papers (92%) were already inconsistent on submission. The inconsistencies found in both submitted and published versions was mainly due to mismatches between objectives and conclusions. One section might be carefully phrased in terms of association while the other presented causal language. When identifying only an association, some authors jumped to recommending acting on the findings as if motivated by the evidence presented. Conclusion: Further guidance is necessary for authors on what constitutes a causal statement and how to justify or discuss assumptions involved. Based on screening these abstracts, we provide a list of expressions beyond the obvious 'cause' word which may inspire a useful more comprehensive compendium on causal language.","Olarte Parra, C.; Bertizzolo, L.; Schroter, S.; Dechartres, A.; Goetghebeur, E.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.17.20194530v1?rss=1,657

171883,Connectivism: Promising Constructs to the E-Learning Systems Success,2021,"We present a two headed approach called Bayesian Integrated Coalescent Epoch PlotS (BICEPS) for efficient inference of coalescent epoch models. Firstly, we integrate out population size parameters and secondly we introduce a set of more powerful Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposals for flexing and stretching trees. Even though population sizes are integrated out and not explicitly sampled through MCMC, we are still able to generate samples from the population size posteriors, which allows demographic reconstruction through time. Altogether, BICEPS can be considered a more muscular version of the popular Bayesian skyline model. We demonstrate its power and correctness by a well calibrated simulation study. Furthermore, we demonstrate with an application to COVID-19 genomic data that some analyses that have trouble converging with the traditional Bayesian skyline prior and standard MCMC proposals can do well with the BICEPS approach. BICEPS is available as open source package for BEAST 2 under GPL license and has a user friendly graphical user interface.","Bouckaert, Remco R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.28.450225,657

In Ghana, 8 out of every 10 children are anaemic. This study employed a novel approach to investigate the determinants of normal haemoglobin (Hb) concentration among children aged 6 to 59 months, using data from the Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys. The results showed that a year change in maternal education was positively associated with normal Hb concentration. Children of non-anaemic mothers were 1.67 (CI=1.32, 2.10; P<.001) times more likely to have normal Hb concentration relative to children of anaemic mothers. Compared to mothers who had less than 4 antenatal care (ANC) visits, mothers who had at least 4 ANC visits increased the odds of their children having a normal Hb concentration by 1.62 (CI=1.09, 2.40; P<.018). Children living in middle and rich households had respectively 1.48 (CI=1.06, 2.07; p<.021) and 1.59 (CI=1.08, 2.33; p<.018) increased odds of having a normal Hb concentration relative to those living in poor households. Maternal education, anaemia, ANC attendance, and household wealth index are strong determinants of normal Hb concentration among children in Ghana. Strategies aimed at addressing childhood anaemia should take into account maternal anaemia, education, poverty and ANC attendance.","Amugsi, D.

Coronaviruses have an extensive range of natural hosts and are known to be responsible for a broad spectrum of diseases in multiple species. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has unleashed a global threat to public health and the economy. Coronaviruses are extensively present in birds and mammals, with horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus affinis), being the reservoir for the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 that seems to have resulted from a zoonotic spillover to the human host, causing respiratory infections, lung injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS). About six coronavirus serotypes are linked with the disease in humans, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh CoV to infect humans. We analyzed the genome sequence of CoV-2 from isolates derived from China as well from India and encountered minute variations in their sequence. A cladogram analysis revealed the predominant strain circulating in India belongs to the A2a clad. We took one such strain (MT012098) and performed a rigorous in-silico genotypic and antigenic analysis to identify its relatedness to other strains. Further, we also performed a detailed prediction for B and T cell epitopes using BepiPred 2.0 server and NetCTL 1.2 server (DTU Bioinformatics), respectively.

172268,A novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency management system based on big data,2020,"Background: Virtual care (VC) and electronic patient-reported experience measures (ePREM) have been systemically adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic to facilitate continuity of cancer care and quality improvement. Digital divides, defined as differential access and benefit from these tools, may exacerbate existing health inequities among patients. We aimed to evaluate digital divides through ePREM access, use, and responses during the pandemic. Methods: Your Voice Matters (YVM), a provincially-mandated ePREM survey, was adapted to an online platform in September 2020 and emailed to patients after outpatient VC and in-person clinic visits at a tertiary cancer centre in Ontario. Age, gender, postal codes, and completed surveys from SeptemberDecember 2020 were collated. Income was estimated using area-level averages from Statistics Canada 2016 census data. Socioeconomic status was mapped to area-level dimensions of the Canadian Index of Multiple Deprivation: residential instability (RI), economic dependency, ethnocultural composition (EC), situational vulnerability (SV). Higher factor scores per dimension correspond to greater marginalization. Two-sided Chisquared and t-tests were used to compare demographics between VC and in-person patients with a significance threshold of p &lt; 0.001. Generalized estimating equations logistic regression models were used to assess associations between patient satisfaction and visit type, as well as demographics. Results: YVM was emailed to 28% (10625/37835) of patients with a response rate of 21.8% (2321/10625). Mean and minimum income (x $10,000) were highest among responders (6.6, 1.5) compared to non-responders (6.3, 1.3) and those without email (6.2, 1.1). Comparing responders with VC (n = 549) and in-person (n = 1719) visits, the former had higher mean income (6.9 vs 6.5, p &lt; 0.001) and lower mean EC factor score (0.2 vs 0.4, p &lt; 0.001). Satisfaction with care received was not associated with visit type and satisfaction with VC logistics was not associated with demographics. Patients with higher EC scores were more likely to rate low satisfaction in 'culturally appropriate' (OR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.57-0.85) and 'respect' (OR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.57-0.85) domains. Patients with higher SV scores were more likely to rate low satisfaction in the 'physical symptoms' (OR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.51-0.94) domain, while patients with higher RI scores were more likely to rate low satisfaction in the 'physical' (OR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.69-0.98) and 'emotional symptoms' (OR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.79-0.98) domains. Conclusions: VC patients had positive experiences with visit logistics across demographics and their satisfaction with care was comparable to that of in-person patients. However, VC use and YVM access, use, and responses were associated with income and socioeconomic status. Identifying populations vulnerable to digital health inequities will guide strategies to bridge the divides.","Safavi, A.; Lovas, M.; Liu, Z.; Melwani, S.; Truong, T.; Devonish, S.; Abdelmutti, N.; Rodin, D.

It has been a significant impact on the surgical care of the patients. There is still no consensus on elective surgeries under time epochs with national partial control of the disease. The objective is to report the clinical course of the surgical patient who was eventually diagnosed with COVID-19 despite preoperative screening. A 69 years old woman was referred to the surgical ward for elective low anterior resection (LAR). The complete preoperative workup was performed with acceptable results. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of SARS-COV-2 was not performed because the patient was asymptomatic and the surgical procedure was scheduled during the time of the country's partial pandemic control;the nadir of the curve in daily reported COVID-19 patients. Following the surgery, the patient's clinical status was stable for about 8 hours;however, the patient became anuric and hypotensive, receiving a variety of treatments for a list of differential diagnoses, including fresh lung CT scan and RT-PCR test;both of the latter were positive for COVID-19. Despite COVID-19 management and respiratory support, the patient died on day 15 of hospitalization. It seems that postponing elective surgeries if possible and general screening with RT-PCR in situations where delay in surgeries is not possible, are rationale strategies for surgical management of the patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, even when the daily situation of the pandemic seems.","Rahmani, H.; Mohammadi, M.",Journal of Cellular and Molecular Anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.22037/jcma.v6i2.32896,657
173025,Fintech in oman: Present and future scenario,2021,"Barrier tissue epithelia play an essential role in maintaining organismal homeostasis, and changes in their cellular composition have been observed in multiple human diseases. Within the small intestinal epithelium, adult stem cells integrate diverse signals to regulate regeneration and differentiation, thereby establishing overall cellularity. Accordingly, directing stem cell differentiation could provide a tractable approach to alter the abundance or quality of specialized cells of the small intestinal epithelium, including the secretory Paneth, goblet, and enteroendocrine populations. Yet, to date, there has been a lack of suitable tools and rigorous approaches to identify biological targets and pharmacological agents that can modify epithelial composition to enable causal testing of disease-associated changes with novel therapeutic candidates. To empower the search for epithelia-modifying agents, we establish a first-of-its-kind high-throughput phenotypic organoid screen. We demonstrate the ability to screen thousands of samples and uncover biological targets and associated small molecule inhibitors which translate to in vivo. This approach is enabled by employing a functional, cell-type specific, scalable assay on an organoid model designed to represent the physiological cues of in vivo Paneth cell differentiation from adult intestinal stem cells. Further, we miniaturize and adapt the organoid culture system to enable automated plating and screening, thereby providing the ability to test thousands of samples. Strikingly, in our screen we identify inhibitors of the nuclear exporter Xpo1 modulate stem cell fate commitment by inducing a pan-epithelial stress response combined with an interruption of mitogen signaling in cycling intestinal progenitors, thereby significantly increasing the abundance of Paneth cells independent of known WNT and Notch differentiation cues. We extend our observation in vivo, demonstrating that oral administration of Xpo1 inhibitor KPT-330 at doses 1,000-fold lower than conventionally used in hematologic malignancies increases Paneth cell abundance. In total, we provide a framework to identify novel biological cues and therapeutic leads to rebalance intestinal stem cell differentiation and modulate epithelial tissue composition via high-throughput phenotypic screening in rationally-designed organoid model of differentiation.","Mead, Benjamin E.; Hattori, Kazuki; Levy, Lauren; Vukovic, Marko; Sze, Daphne; Matute, Juan D.; Duan, Jinzhi; Langer, Robert; Blumberg, Richard S.; Ordovas-Montanes, Jose; Shalek, Alex K.; Karp, Jeffrey M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.063727,657
173859,"Coins, Covid, Keynes and K-Shaped Recovery",2021,"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in South Africa, one Prophetic Pentecostal Church, Rabboni Centre Ministries, brought about a marked change in their practice and theology of confession and absolution. Before COVID-19, the Prophet would exorcise the evil spirits that caused sinful behaviour in people and in this way restore them as good Christians acceptable to the congregation. During the COVID-19 lockdown, people could not meet in church and therefore the Prophet changed the practice and theology of confession and absolution. People had to personally identify their own sins and write these down in an email that they sent to the church. Their confessions were then read out, and they were given absolution by the Prophet. During COVID-19, sins were understood as the wrong actions and thoughts of believers, who were personally responsible for their sins. Sins were no longer blamed on Satan. No exorcism followed confessions, rather people were absolved by the Prophet just as people are absolved by priests in mainline churches. In this article, I show that through the act of self-reflection and confession, people are able to take control of their lives and determine their future selves. It also enables people to re-connect to the faith community, the Prophet and God.

While CUREs guided by faculty research interests are common, this article describes CUREs embedded in the senior chemistry curriculum that were driven entirely by students' research interests. Activities are described in detail that brought student-driven CUREs (SD-CUREs) from their inception of defining research questions to the fruition of presenting results at multiple venues to diverse audiences, over the course of the academic year. These activities included building students' proficiency in analytical instrumentation, enhancing their library research and technical writing skills, and providing support as students developed research questions and laboratory protocols starting from the primary literature. Students gained experience in grant writing by submitting proposals to the ""Capstone Projects Grant"" funded by The Evergreen State College Foundation. Support provided by the science staff, the librarian/writing instructor, as well as financial support from the college were instrumental in the success of the SD-CUREs. While there were some inherent challenges, SD-CUREs resulted in the evolution of a research community of engaged student leaders who demonstrated ownership of their research projects and were supportive and conducive to the success of all students. A survey of students indicated very positive impressions of the CUREs. Assessment tools used for the SD-CUREs, success of students beyond the CUREs, and the impact of COVID-19 on the CUREs are discussed in the article.","Bopegedera, A. M. R.

174126,Adaptive Group Testing on Networks with Community Structure,2021,"Motor learning is fundamental to motor rehabilitation outcomes and has been associated with visuospatial memory function in previous studies. Current predictive models of motor recovery of individuals with stroke generally exclude cognitive measures, overlooking the connection between motor learning and visuospatial memory. Recent work has demonstrated that a clinical test of visuospatial memory (Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Delayed Recall) may predict one-month skill learning in older adults, but if this relationship persists in individuals with chronic stroke remains unknown. The purpose of this short report was to extend these findings by evaluating the extent these test scores impacted prediction in older adults and determine if this relationship generalized to individuals with stroke pathology. To address these questions, we trained two regression models (one including Delayed Recall scores and one without) using data from non-stroke older adults. To determine the extent to which Delayed Recall test scores impacted prediction accuracy of one-month skill learning in older adults, we used leave-one-out cross-validation to evaluate the prediction error between models. To determine if this predictive relationship persisted in individuals with chronic ischemic stroke, we then tested each trained model on an independent stroke dataset. Results indicated that in both stroke and non-stroke datasets, inclusion of Delayed Recall scores explained significantly more variance of one-month skill performance than models that included age, education, and baseline motor performance alone. This proof-of-concept suggests that the relationship between delayed visuospatial memory and one-month motor skill performance generalizes to individuals with chronic stroke and supports the idea that visuospatial testing may provide prognostic insight into motor rehabilitation outcomes.","VanGilder, Jennapher Lingo; Hooyman, Andrew; Bosch, Pamela R.; Schaefer, Sydney Y.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.14.330357,657

174571,Qurra An Offline AI-based Mobile Doctor,2020,"Metapopulation structure (i.e. the spatial arrangement of local populations and corridors between them) plays a fundamental role in the persistence of wildlife populations, but can also drive the spread of infectious diseases. While the disruption of metapopulation connectivity can reduce disease spread, it can also impair host resilience by disrupting gene flow and colonisation dynamics. Thus, a pressing challenge for many wildlife populations is to elucidate whether the benefits of disease management methods that reduce metapopulation connectivity outweigh the associated risks. Directly transmissible cancers are clonal malignant cell lines capable to spread through host populations without immune recognition, when susceptible and infected hosts become in close contact. Using an individual-based metapopulation model we investigate the effects of the interplay between host dispersal, disease transmission rate and inter-individual contact distance for transmission (determining within-population mixing) on the spread and persistence of a transmissible cancer, Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease (DFTD), from local to regional scales. Further, we explore population isolation scenarios to devise management strategies to mitigate disease spread. Disease spread, and the ensuing population declines, are synergistically determined by individuals’ dispersal, disease transmission rate and within-population mixing. Low to intermediate transmission rates can be magnified by high dispersal and inter-individual transmission distance. Once disease transmission rate is high, dispersal and inter-individual contact distance do not impact the outcome of the disease transmission dynamics. Isolation of local populations effectively reduced metapopulation-level disease prevalence but caused severe declines in metapopulation size and genetic diversity. The relative position of managed (i.e. isolated) populations within the metapopulation had a significant effect on disease prevalence, highlighting the importance of considering metapopulation structure when implementing metapopulation-scale disease control measures. Our findings suggests that population isolation is not an ideal management method for preventing disease spread in species inhabiting already fragmented landscapes, where genetic diversity and extinction risk are already a concern, such as the Tasmanian devil.","Durrant, Rowan; Hamede, Rodrigo; Wells, Konstans; Lurgi, Miguel",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.04.463046,657

175610,Tolerance-Based Short Text Sentiment Classifier,2021,"The energy trade is an important pillar of each country's development, making up for the imbalance in the production and consumption of fossil fuels. Geopolitical risks affect the energy trade of various countries to a certain extent, but the causes of geopolitical risks are complex, and energy trade also involves many aspects, so the impact of geopolitics on energy trade is also complex. Based on the monthly data from 2000 to 2020 of 17 emerging economies, this paper employs the fixed-effect model and the regression-discontinuity (RD) model to verify the negative impact of geopolitics on energy trade first and then analyze the mechanism and heterogeneity of the impact. The following conclusions are drawn: First, geopolitics has a significant negative impact on the import and export of the energy trade, and the inhibition on the export is greater than that on the import. Second, the impact mechanism of geopolitics on the energy trade is reflected in the lagging effect and mediating effect on the imports and exports; that is, the negative impact of geopolitics on energy trade continued to be significant 10 months later. Coal and crude oil prices, as mediating variables, decreased to reduce the imports and exports, whereas natural gas prices showed an increase. Third, the impact of geopolitics on energy trade is heterogeneous in terms of national attribute characteristics and geo-event types.","Li, Fen; Yang, Cunyi; Li, Zhenghui; Failler, Pierre",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11077v1.pdf,657

Demands in social and material needs surged, and they could not be met solely by unprepared infrastructures. Although local communities complemented them in previous disasters, physical distancing measures to prevent the spread of the virus undermined human connection, and local communities had to come up with novel ways to provide support. To develop insights from such adaptations of local communities, we explored civic activities for immediate disaster relief in multiple local communities across the United States and interviewed civic initiative organizers and attendees. In this paper, we articulate our findings into pattern language, a schema of reusable solutions for recurring problems. We present two patterns for community-based disaster recovery and discuss the effectiveness of codifying civic activities for disaster relief into patterns. © 2021 ACM.","Jo, J.; Knearem, T.; Tsai, C.

176291,An SDN-based Firewall for Networks with Varying Security Requirements,2021,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated rapid changes to services to minimise the risk of viral transmission, including widespread adoption of remote consultation methods.1 From April 2020, we changed our pre-operative assessment service for elective caesarean section (CS) patients from a face-to-face consultation 1-3 days before admission to a telephone-based service. This included signposting to an electronic version of our patient information leaflet (PIL), which was previously poorly accessed.2 A service evaluation was conducted to assess patient satisfaction of this new approach. Methods: A voluntary, anonymous, 15-point questionnaire was offered on admission to elective caesarean section patients from May to October 2020. Distribution continued until fifty responses were received. Responses were collected post-operatively. Results: 98% of respondents (49) rated the care provided during the consultation as very good or excellent. 92% (46) expressed either no preference or would prefer a telephone consultation if given a choice, whilst only 8% (4) said they would prefer to attend hospital for face-to-face consultation. Two respondents reported hearing impairment, though still rated the consultation as very good or excellent. 82% (41) of respondents felt better prepared for their CS than prior to the consultation. 68% (34) were aware of the patient information leaflet (compared with 21-35% previously)2 and 80% of these had found it useful. Discussion: The telephone preoperative consultation appears overall effective and satisfactory for most patients, however a formal pathway for patients with language or communication needs that preclude telephone consultation is required. Holding the consultation prior to admission appears to help women feel more prepared for admission, and awareness of the PIL has improved. The service evaluation was limited by its convenience sampling.","Round, M.; Dunham, R.; Harkett, L.; Lewis, B.; Whapples, A.; Plunkett, E.",International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijoa.2021.103042,657

176520,Cough Activated Dynamic Face Visor,2021,"The contact sites between ER and mitochondria regulate several cellular processes including inter-organelle lipid transport, calcium homeostasis and autophagy. However, the mechanisms that regulate the dynamics and functions of these contact sites remain unresolved. We show that annulate lamellae (AL), a relatively unexplored subcellular structure representing subdomains of ER enriched with a subset of nucleoporins, are present at ER-mitochondria contact sites (ERMCS). Depletion of one of the AL-resident nucleoporins, Nup358, results in increased contacts between ER and mitochondria. Mechanistically, Nup358 modulates ERMCS dynamics by restricting mTORC2/Akt signalling. Our results suggest that growth factor-mediated remodelling of ERMCS depends on a reciprocal binding of Nup358 and mTOR to the ERMCS tethering complex consisting of VAPB and PTPIP51. Furthermore, Nup358 also interacts with IP3R, an ERMCS-enriched Ca2+ channel, and controls Ca2+ release from the ER. Consequently, depletion of Nup358 leads to elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+ and autophagy via activation of Ca2+/CaMKK2/AMPK axis. Our study thus uncovers a novel role for AL, particularly for Nup358, in regulating mTORC2-mediated ERMCS remodelling and Ca2+-directed autophagy, possibly via independent mechanisms.","Kalarikkal, Misha; Saikia, Rimpi; Varshney, Pallavi; Dhamale, Prathamesh; Majumdar, Amitabha; Joseph, Jomon",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.01.462723,657

It is an industry standard used by both public and private entities that costs a lot of resources to maintain and secure. On the other hand, identity-based cryptography removes the need for certificates, which in turn lowers the cost. In this work, we present a practical implementation of a hybrid PKI that can issue new identity-based cryptographic keys for authentication purposes while bootstrapping trust with existing certificate authorities. We provide a set of utilities to generate and use such keys within the context of an identity-based environment as well as an external environment (i.e., without root trust to the private key generator). Key revocation is solved through our custom naming design which currently supports a few scenarios (e.g., expire by date, expire by year and valid for year). Our implementation offers a high degree of interoperability by incorporating X.509 standards into identity-based cryptography (IBC) compared to existing works on hybrid PKI–IBC systems. The utilities provided are minimalist and can be integrated with existing tools such as the Enterprise Java Bean Certified Authority (EJBCA).","Chia, Jason Swee-Huay Heng Ji-Jian Chin Syh-Yuan Tan Wei-Chuen Yau",Symmetry,https://doi.org/10.3390/sym13081535,657

The successful outcomes of the educational content delivery in MET institutes depend, to a certain extent, on the maritime instructor’s ability to create conducive learning environments utilizing all of the resources available. The self-efficacy of maritime instructors in various facets, most notably their proficiency with the use of technology in classrooms, can lead to the introduction of transformative learning practices. Accurately measuring their self-reported technological proficiency could be the initial step in this direction. This study aimed to measure the self-reported technology proficiency of maritime instructors using an established and validated scale: Technology Proficiency Self-Assessment for the 21st century (TPSA-C21). The scale was administered, using an online survey, to a sample of MET instructors within Europe and the UK, with n = 62 valid responses received. Using descriptive statistics and the evaluation of the measurement model, the study highlighted the perceived level of proficiency of the MET instructors along dimensions such as email, world-wide web use, emerging tools, teaching with technology, integrated applications, and teaching with emerging technologies. The survey also measured the perceived level of technology integration for maritime instructors according to the Concerned-Based Adoption Model–Level of Use (CBAM–LoU) classification. The results indicate a potential area of improvement for maritime instructors with regard to their self-reported proficiency, namely in the dimension of teaching with emerging technology.

This vulnerable population has been prioritized for vaccination, but the level of protection achieved in these immunocompromised patients is unclear. Objectives: To evaluate the protection of MHD patients against COVID-19 after 2 doses (2D) of BNT162b2, and the safety and impact on immune responses of a 3rd dose (3D). Design: Prospective observational. Setting, Patients, intervention and measurements: REIN national registry was used to compare the severity of 1474 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in MHD patients after 0, 1 or 2 doses of mRNA vaccine. Anti-spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and interferon gamma-producing CD4+ and CD8+ specific-T cells were measured after 2D and 3D of BNT162b2 in a monocentric cohort of 75 MHD patients. Results: Vaccination reduced disease severity but 11% of MHD patients infected after 2D still died. Tolerance to 3D of BNT162b2 was excellent. MHD patients with humoral response similar to healthy volunteers after 2D did not generate more immune effectors after 3D and had more side effects. In contrast, 2/3 of MHD patients with suboptimal response after 2D reached optimal titer of anti-RBD IgG and/or developed spike-specific CD8+ T cells after 3D. Presence of spike-specific CD4+ T cells after 2D was associated with response to 3D in multivariate analysis (OR=4.80 [1.23-21.54]; p=0.029). Limitations: Limited number of patients injected with 3D. Conclusion: Standard scheme of vaccination provides insufficient protection to some MHD patients. Anti-RBD IgG and specific CD4+ T cells should be measured after 2D. Among patients with suboptimal humoral response, those with specific CD4+ T cells could benefit of a 3rd dose of vaccine.","Espi, M.; Charmetant, X.; Barba, T.; Pelletier, C.; Koppe, L.; Chalencon, E.; Kalbacher, E.; Mathias, V.; Ovize, A.; Cart-Tanneur, E.; Bouze, C.; Pellegrina, L.; Morelon, E.; Juillard, L.; Fouque, D.; Couchoud, C.; Thaunat, O.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.02.21259913v1?rss=1,657

177566,Performance and Deployment Status of MUSCAT: a 1500-Pixel LEKID-Based mm-Wave Camera for the Large Millimeter Telescope,2020,"The current pandemic has caused a dramatic reduction in the use of office buildings. However, organisations eventually need to plan for the return of employees to office spaces by ensuring their bio-safety. While symptomatic employees can be screened out from buildings, asymptomatic employees can be handled mainly through social distancing. Using rules of thumb and being conservative (aggressive) in social distancing can lead to poor office space/energy utilisation (compromised bio-safety). Thus, there is a need for informed decision making about occupancy to ensure bio-safety. To this end, we consider the problem of maximising the office space utilisation while ensuring occupant bio-safety and comfort. Specifically, we algorithmically identify the maximum allowable occupancy and corresponding occupant placement in open-plan office space while bounding their likelihood of infection from the office. As a secondary objective, when the required occupancy is less than the maximum allowable, we consider the problem of minimising HVAC energy through the joint control of multiple actuators that serve the space. In addition to the temperature and humidity dynamics, we account for the spatial and temporal evolution of infection transmission in the office space. To the best of our knowledge, there is little prior work on joint bio-safety and comfort optimization. The optimization problem is computationally hard due to the underlying non-linear system dynamics. We present two greedy heuristics to solve the problems of maximising space utilisation and minimising the HVAC energy when feasible. We evaluate our approach using simulations for varying community infection rates, occupant exposure duration, and virus emission rate. Our approach performs better than standard regular placements that ensure a minimum separation between neighbours. For the range of parameters considered, our approach improves space utilization by at least 10% for the same new infection rate. Further, when the required occupancy is less than the maximum allowable, HVAC energy can reduce by up to 15% even while ensuring bio-safety. © 2020 ACM.","Manoharan, P.; Nagarathinam, S.; Vasan, A.; Pb, V.

179323,TopiQAL: Topic-aware Question Answering using Scalable Domain-specific Supercomputers,2020,"Background Hepatitis E virus, typically genotypes 1 and 2, is a major cause of avoidable morbidity and mortality in South Asia. Although case fatality risk among pregnant women can reach as high as 25%, a lack of population-level disease burden data has been cited as a primary factor in key global policy recommendations against the routine use of licensed hepatitis E vaccines, one of the only effective tools available for preventing disease and death. Methods We tested serum from a nationally-representative serosurvey in Bangladesh for anti-HEV IgG. We estimated the proportion of the population with evidence of historical HEV infection and used Bayesian geostatistical models to generate high resolution national maps of seropositivity. We examined variability in seropositivity by individual-level, household-level, and community-level risk factors using spatial logistic regression. Results We tested serum samples from 2924 individuals from 70 communities representing all divisions of Bangladesh and estimated a national seroprevalence of hepatitis E of 20% (95% CI 17-24%). Seropositivity increased with age and male sex (OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.8-2.8). Community-level seroprevalence ranged from 0-78% with the seroprevalence in urban areas being higher, including Dhaka, the capital, with 3-fold (95%CrI 2.3-3.7) higher seroprevalence than the rest of the country. Conclusion Hepatitis E infections are common throughout Bangladesh, though 90% of women reach reproductive age without any evidence of previous exposure to the virus, thus likely susceptible to infection and disease. Strengthening clinical surveillance for hepatitis E, especially in urban areas may help generate additional evidence needed to appropriately target interventions like vaccines to the populations most likely to benefit.","Azman, A.; Paul, K.

Uncertainty remains about the optimal initial antihypertensive therapy in the settings of real practice. Methods: The Learning Implementation of Guideline-based decision support system for Hypertension Treatment (LIGHT) trial is a pragmatic, cluster-randomized controlled trial of CDSS versus usual care conducted in 100 primary care practices in China. The primary outcome is the proportion of hypertension visits with appropriate (guideline-recommended) antihypertensive treatment. Among patients recruited from primary care practices of the intervention group in the LIGHT trial, we further conducted a sub-study, the LIGHT-ACD trial, to compare the effects of initial antihypertensive therapy by randomizing individual patients to receive different antihypertensive regimens of initial monotherapy or dual therapy. The primary outcome of the sub-study is the absolute change in blood pressure from baseline to 9 months. Results: We hypothesize that the use of CDSS will result in a higher proportion of appropriate antihypertensive treatments being prescribed during visits for hypertension control in the LIGHT trial, and that particular choices of monotherapy or combinations of dual therapy lead to greater blood pressure change in the LIGHT-ACD trial. Conclusion: These nested trials will provide reliable evidence on the effectiveness of CDSS for improving adherence to guidelines for hypertension management in primary care, and data on the effectiveness of different initial antihypertensive regimens for blood pressure reduction.","Song, J.; Wang, X.; Wang, B.; Gao, Y.; Liu, J.; Zhang, H.; LI, X.; Li, J.; Wang, J.; Cai, J.; Herrin, J.; Armitage, J.; Krumholz, H.; Zheng, X.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253427v1?rss=1,657
180461,More Agile than ever: The case study of the development of a dashboard for the management of ICU beds during the coronavirus outbreak,2021,"Plague has caused three major pandemics with millions of casualties in the past centuries. There is a substantial amount of historical and modern primary and secondary literature about the spatial and temporal extent of epidemics, circumstances of transmission or symptoms and treatments. Many quantitative analyses rely on structured data, but the extraction of specific information such as the time and place of outbreaks is a tedious process. Machine learning algorithms for natural language processing (NLP) can potentially facilitate the establishment of datasets, but their use in plague research has not been explored much yet. We investigated the performance of five pre-trained NLP libraries (Google NLP, Stanford CoreNLP, spaCy, germaNER and Geoparser.io) for the extraction of location data from a German plague treatise published in 1908 compared to the gold standard of manual annotation. Of all tested algorithms, we found that Stanford CoreNLP had the best overall performance but spaCy showed the highest sensitivity. Moreover, we demonstrate how word associations can be extracted and displayed with simple text mining techniques in order to gain a quick insight into salient topics. Finally, we compared our newly digitised plague dataset to a re-digitised version of the famous Biraben plague list and update the spatio-temporal extent of the second pandemic plague mentions. We conclude that all NLP tools have their limitations, but they are potentially useful to accelerate the collection of data and the generation of a global plague outbreak database.","Krauer, F.; Schmid, B.

180970,R-Mon: An mhealth Tool for Real-time Respiratory Monitoring During Pandemics and Self-Isolation,2020,"IntroductionDepression, as a psychiatric entity, has a number of emotional components. These are mainly known among patients over the age of 65: sadness, physical and mental exhaustion, irritability, feeling of emptiness and loneliness.ObjectivesThe main objective of this study is to detect if the effects of the Covid 19 pandemic over 65 years of age such as fear, excessive anxiety, lack of motivation, uncertainty and environmental changes, isolation (resulting in sleep disorders, appetite and attention) caused the exacerbation of depression.MethodsThis study included a total number of 126 patients, each over 65, hospitalized at the Psychiatric Hospital “Elisabeta Doamna” in Galati in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. They were diagnosed with depression, according to ICD-10 and the Hamilton scale.ResultsAll data obtained were centralized and used to detect whether, in Galați, the lockdown impacted the number of admissions of people over 65, diagnosed with depression, with an average age of 68,62. There is an increased incidence of female patients (75%), thus reporting an odds ratio of 3:1. The incidence of cases reported during the months of presentation is as follows: January (24%), February (28.8%), March (14.4%), April (3.2%), May (5.6%), June (23.2%).ConclusionsEnvironmental factors, unique in this situation, isolation, social distancing and changes in the daily routine, each associated with this global epidemiological crisis determinated a decrease of the number of depressive elderly admissions between March 15th and May 15th.","Rădulescu, I.

181013,Using electronic health records to accurately predict COVID-19 health outcomes through a novel machine learning pipeline,2021,"Background A pressing need exists to develop vaccines for neglected diseases, including leishmaniasis. However, the development of new vaccines is dependent on their value to two key players -vaccine developers and manufacturers who need to have confidence in the global demand in order to commit to research and production; and governments (or other international funders) who need to signal demand based on the potential public health benefits of the vaccine in their local context, as well as its affordability. A detailed global epidemiological analysis is rarely available before a vaccine enters a market due to lack of resources as well as insufficient global data necessary for such an analysis. Our study seeks to bridge this information gap by providing a generalisable approach to estimating the commercial and public health value of a vaccine in development relying primarily on publicly available Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data. This simplified approach is easily replicable and can be used to guide discussions and investments into vaccines and other health technologies where evidence constraints exist. The approach is demonstrated through the estimation of the demand curve for a future leishmaniasis vaccine. Methodology/Principal findings We project the ability to pay over the period 2030-2040 for a vaccine preventing cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis (CL / VL), using an illustrative set of countries which account for most of the global disease burden. First, based on previous work on vaccine demand projections in these countries and CL / VL GBD-reported incidence rates, we project the potential long-term impact of the vaccine on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted as a result of reduced incidence. Then, we apply an economic framework to our estimates to determine vaccine affordability based on the abilities to pay of governments and global funders, leading to estimates of the demand and market size. Based on our estimates, the maximum ability-to-pay of a leishmaniasis vaccine (per course, including delivery costs), given the current estimates of incidence and population at risk, is higher than $5 for nearly half of the 24 countries considered, with a median value-based maximum price of $4.4-$5.3, and total demand of over 560 million courses. Conclusion/Significance Our results demonstrate that both the quantity of vaccines estimated to be required by the countries considered as well as their ability-to-pay could make a vaccine for leishmaniasis commercially attractive to potential manufacturers. The methodology used can be equally applied to other technology developments targeting health in developing countries.","Mohan, S.; Revill, P.; Malvolti, S.; Malhame, M.; Sculpher, M.; Kaye, P.

181104,Fighting Alcohol Craving Using Virtual Reality: the Role of Social Interaction,2021,"Objective: We sought to compare the costs of a nighttime pre-emergency pediatric telemedicine and medication delivery service (TMDS) per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted to the costs of hospital emergency medicine (HEM) per DALY averted from a societal perspective. Methods: We studied a nighttime pediatric TMDS and HEM in a semi-urban and rural region of Haiti. Costs of the 2 services were enumerated to represent the financial investments of both providers and patients. DALYs averted were calculated to represent the years lives lost (YLL) and years lost to disability (YLD) from diarrheal, respiratory, and skin (bacterial and scabies etiologies) disease among children from zero to 9 years old. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated and compared to the per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) of Haiti ($1,177). Cost-effectiveness was defined as an ICER less than 3 times the per-capita GDP of Haiti ($3,531). Univariate sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate how uncertainty of individual parameter estimates (utilization rates, costs, lost wages, discounting factor) affected the ICER. Results: The total costs of the nighttime TMDS and HEM to society were $285,931.72 per year and $89,335.41 per year, respectively. The DALYs averted by the TMDS and HEM were 199.76 and 22.37, respectively. Through sensitivity analyses, the ICER of the TMDS ranged from $791.43 to $1,593.35. Conclusion: A nighttime pediatric TMDS is a cost-effective alternative to HEM for pre-emergency pediatric care in semi-urban and rural regions in Haiti, and possibly in similar lower-middle income countries.","Klarman, M.; Flaherty, K.

This study aimed to measure the dentists' anxiety and apprehension of being infected while operating during the latest coronavirus disease (COVlD-19) epidemic through a web-based questionnaire. Materials and Methods: An online survey was used to perform a cross-sectional analysis. The well-constructed questionnaire, which consisted of closed-ended questions, was prepared and submitted to dentists of India. A total of 396 people from all over India took part in the survey. Results: The debilitating consequences of COVlD-19 caused anxiety and fear in a total of 55.8% of general dental practitioners in India. There were 373 dentists (94.2%) who were mindful of recent developments in care procedures. The majority of dentists, 316 (79.8%), are fearful of contracting COVID-19 from a patient or co-worker, and 309 (78%) dentists are nervous when treating a patient with COVID-19. Conclusion: Indian dentists revealed good information regarding COVID-19. However, dentists were comprehensive about the extra precautionary measures that protect them about the virus. A considerable percentage of dentists reflected their anxiety and worries about dental profession due to which they have either changed their services to comply with the rules or shut down their practices for an indefinite time.","Upadhyay, N.; Shah, M.; Raval, Y.",Advances in Human Biology,https://doi.org/10.4103/aihb.aihb_43_21,657

Here, estimation is performed on patients who are likely to come in contact with COVID-19 disease, using clinical predictive models with the help of deep learning. The most informative features are extracted from chest X-ray images for COVID-19 patients and non COVID-19 patients. These images are used for COVID detection. Patients with other chronic diseases are more vulnerable to COVID-19. Hence, we put forward a Heart Disease Prediction system based on machine learning algorithms.

Our findings confirm that during the pandemic physical activity and sitting time for study purposes decreased, while sleeping and sitting for purposes other than studying increased, with more pronounced changes among girls. Drinking and smoking decreased and boys experienced greater decreases. The findings also indicated that the pandemic generated positive outcomes for mental health: stress, sadness/despair, and suicidal ideation decreased, which was counterintuitive to our general expectations, with a greater impact seen among girls.","Yu, Seunghee Choe Chung",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13168821,657

We elucidated clinical and humoral immune response and genomic analysis of vaccine breakthrough (VBT) infections after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in healthcare workers (HCWs). Methods: The study was conducted on 1858 HCWs receiving two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV- 19 vaccine. Serial blood samples were collected to measure SARS CoV2 IgG and neutralizing antibodies. 46 RT-PCR positive samples from VBT infections were subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS). Results: Infection was confirmed in 219 (11.79%) HCWs of which 21.46% (47/219) were non-vaccinated, significantly more (p <0.001) than 9.52% (156/1639) vaccinated group. VBT infections were significantly higher in doctors and nurses compared to other hospital staff (p <0.001). Unvaccinated individuals had 1.57 times higher risk of infection compared to partially vaccinated (p 0.02) and 2.49 times than fully vaccinated (<0.001). Partially vaccinated were at higher risk of infection than fully vaccinated (RR 1.58,p 0.01). There were 3 (1.36%) severe cases and 1 death in unvaccinated group compared to none in the vaccinated. Non-response after 14 days of second dose was seen in 6.5% (3/46) and low antibody levels (1-4.62 S/CO) in 8.69% (4/46). Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was dominant (69.5%) and reinfection was documented in 4 (0.06%) HCWs. Conclusions: Nearly one in ten vaccinated HCWs can get infected, more so with only single dose (13.65%) than two doses (8.62%). Fully vaccinated are better protected with higher humoral immune response. Genomic analysis revealed an alarming rise of Delta variant (B.1.617.2) in VBT infections.","Kale, P.; Gupta, E.; Bihari, C.; Patel, N.; Rooge, S.; Pandey, A.; Bajpai, M.; Khillan, V.; Chattopadhyay, P.

The purpose of the study is two-fold: (1) to explore leisure experiences and participation during the COVID-19 global pandemic;and (2) to examine how leisure experiences and participation contribute to stress-related growth during this public health crisis. A total of 470 U.S. residents completed an online survey in July 2020. The results indicated a decline in participation for all types of leisure activities. Changes in leisure activities varied by age and income but social activities had the most substantial decline, followed by outdoor and physical activities.

182665,COVID-Vision: A Virtual Reality Experience to Encourage Mindfulness of Social Distancing in Public Spaces,2021,"Food insecurity rates have declined overall (pre-COVID), but have increased significantly among older adults in the past decade. The majority of older adults in the U.S. also have suboptimal diet quality. An older adult's household role may influence their diet quality and the household's food security status, especially in mixed-generation households, but this hypothesis has yet to be tested. To explore the relationships between an older adult's household role, the household's food security status, and the older adult's diet quality in mixed-generation households. A cross-sectional analysis of a nationally-representative sample of U.S. households with at least 1 older adult (age 60+ years) from the 2011-2016 NHANES was conducted (n = 8,136). Households were categorized as: older adult as head of household and child caregiver (ie, child(ren) present, but no adults 18-59 years;HHC);head of household, but not a caregiver (HHNC);and neither head of household nor caregiver (ie, reference person &lt; 60 years;NHNC). The U.S. Household Food Security Survey and Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) from a single dietary recall were used to assess food security status and diet quality, respectively. Weighted chi-square and ANOVA tests were used to compare food security status and HEI-2015 scores across household categories, respectively. HHNC households were significantly more likely to be fully food secure (84% FFS;P &lt; 0.001) than HHC households (67% FFS) and NHNC households (68% FFS). Older adults as HHNC had significantly higher HEI-2015 scores (mean: 53.7, P &lt; 0.001) than HHC older adults (50.2) and NHNC older adults (51.5). Findings suggest that caregiving demands may have a negative influence on food security and diet quality of older adults in mixed generation households. While such relationships have potential bearing on nutrition programming and policy, further research is needed to understand the underlying household dynamics, including more advanced analyses to account for potential covariates (eg, the number and age of children and roles of other household members).

METHODS The laboratory findings of the 4 cases with SARS occurring in Guangzhou, People's Republic of China, in 2004 were analyzed and compared with that during epidemic. RESULTS Leukopenia and lymphocytopenia were seen in all the patients. Two patients had slightly decreased peripheral blood T lymphocyte count. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels increased slightly in 3 patients. No hypoxemia was seen in all the patients.

SARS coronary virus (SARS-CoV) RNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in pharyngeal swabs only in 1 patient. CONCLUSION The 4 sporadic SARS patients in 2004 have milder manifestations, shorter course of disease with no complications during an epidemic, compared with patients seen previously. The change in laboratory findings is less than that, which might be attributable to milder virulence of the SARS-CoV. The antibody appears earlier in these patients.

195013,Back to school.,2008,"The genome of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) contains genes which have been shown to be nonessential for viral replication and which could, in principle, be used as sites for the introduction of foreign sequences. We have inserted heterologous genetic material into gene 4 of MHV in order (i) to test the applicability of targeted RNA recombination for site-directed mutagenesis of the MHV genome upstream of the N gene; (ii) to develop further genetic tools for mutagenesis of structural genes other than N; and (iii) to examine the feasibility of using MHV as an expression vector. A DI-like donor RNA vector containing the MHV S gene and all genes distal to S was constructed. Initially, a derivative of this was used to insert a 19-nucleotide tag into the start of ORF 4a of MHV-A59 using the N gene deletion mutant A1b4 as the recipient virus. Subsequently, the entire gene for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was inserted in place of gene 4. This heterologous gene was shown to be expressed by recombinant viruses but not at levels sufficient to allow detection of fluorescence of viral plaques. Northern blot analysis of transcripts of GFP recombinants showed the expected displacement of the mobility, relative to those of wild-type, of all subgenomic mRNAs larger than mRNA5. An unexpected result of the Northern analysis was the observation that GFP recombinants also produced an RNA species the same size as that of wild-type mRNA4. RT-PCR analysis of the 5' end of this species revealed that it was actually a collection of mRNAs originating from a cluster of 10 different sites, none of which possessed a canonical intergenic sequence.

Summary Meniere's disease is an inner ear disorder characterized by the presence of endolymphatic hydrops in the inner ear and symptomatology of recurrent and debilitating vertigo attacks, tinnitus, aural fullness, and fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss. Although many therapeutic options for MD have been proposed during years, no consensus has been reached by the scientific community. In the last decade, many therapeutic options have been proposed, as intratympanic steroid, intratympanic gentamicin, and intravenous glycerol. Recently, the role of the antisecretory factor in the diet of MD patients have been investigated. Surgery is recommended for intractable MD; some authors proposed new approaches including transcanal endoscopic infracochlear vestibular neurectomy, new marsupiliazation technique in sac surgery, and tenotomy of the stapedius and tensor tympani muscles.","Scarpa, A; Ralli, M; De Bonis, E; Troisi, D; Montanino, A; Viola, P; Chiarella, G; Gioacchini, F M; Cavaliere, M; Cassandro, E; Cassandro, C",Translational medicine @ UniSa,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33457323/,657

202328,Chest X-ray Classification Using Deep Learning for Automated COVID-19 Screening,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This survey of centres caring for patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) was conducted to assess the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the management of these patients in terms of provision of care, monitoring, regular follow-up and any changes to service infrastructure. METHODS: A survey was devised and publically published on the REDCap database management system with individual centres responding to a public link. RESULTS: 78 adult and paediatric centres worldwide contributed to the survey, representing at least 3500 patients' experience. Centres (n/78 unless otherwise specified, %) reported infrastructure maintenance for PN bag deliveries to patients (60, 76.92%) or delivery of ancillary items (dressing packs, gloves, bungs) (57, 73.08%) home delivery and HPN administration (65, 83.33%) but homecare nurse shortages (25, 32.05%). Follow up of routine HPN patients changed to either all telemed or mixed with emergency clinic review (70, 89.74%). In 26 centres (33.33%), new discharges on HPN for benign conditions were reduced or stopped. Based on clinical history the centres reported psychological distress for patients (52, 66.67%) with anxiety, worry, concern and apprehension reported most frequently (37/52, 71.15%) but also fear (10/52, 19.23%), depression (5/52, 9.62%) and issues related to isolation/confinement (12/52, 23.08%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was reported by clinicians to have had a far reaching adverse impact on patients on home parenteral nutrition, especially their safety in terms of provision of PPE, PN bags, available nursing staff and psychological well-being.

In the first part of our review the current knowledge about a potential association of a SARS-CoV­2 infection with dysfunction and diseases of cranial and peripheral nerves is discussed. Anosmia, ageusia, motor cranial nerve involvement and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) were described in a temporal association with a SARS-CoV­2 infection. Several studies could show that anosmia and ageusia were frequent symptoms of a SARS-CoV­2 infection. In contrast the failure of other cranial nerves has so far only been sporadically described. A number of case reports and case series indicate a causal association between a SARS-CoV­2 infection and GBS but epidemiological evidence is still lacking.","Lehmann, Helmar C; Schoser, Benedikt; Wunderlich, Gilbert; Berlit, Peter; Fink, Gereon R",Nervenarzt,,657

BNT162b2 is new type of vaccine, and previous studies have shown that the antibody response was significantly elevated in patients with prior COVID-19 infection after the first vaccination. However, no study has evaluated the efficacy of the vaccination or the adverse reactions of people with prior COVID-19 infection in Japan. The aim of this study is to evaluate the antibody titer and adverse reactions of BNT162b2 vaccine among participants with prior COVID-19 infection in Japan. MethodsThe data for this study was collected between April 15, 2021, and June 9, 2021. All of the hospital staff who received the BNT162b2 vaccine were included in this study and were sorted into either the prior infection group or the control group. We collected the data of adverse reactions through self-reporting and calculated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibody titer for all participants. ResultsThe antibody titer of the prior-infection group in first antibody test was significantly higher than that of the control group in the second antibody test. There was no significant difference in adverse reactions between the prior infection group receiving its first vaccination and the control group receiving its second vaccination. ConclusionOur study shows that the antibody response following the first vaccination in the prior COVID-19 infection group was found to be comparable to that of the second vaccination in the control group; however, the evaluation of adverse reactions was inadequate and further, large-scale studies are needed.","Mitsunaga, Toshiya; Ohtaki, Yuhei; Seki, Yutaka; Yoshioka, Masakata; Mori, Hiroshi; Suzuka, Midori; Mashiko, Syunsuke; Takeda, Satoshi; Mashiko, Kunihiro",,,657

METHODS: We compared glycemic metrics during lockdown with the same period of 2019. The psychological impact was evaluated with the Test of Anxiety and Depression. RESULTS: We analyzed metrics of 117 adolescents (87% on Multiple Daily Injections and 100% were flash glucose monitoring/continuous glucose monitoring users). During the lockdown, we observed an increase of the percentage of time in range (TIR) (p<0.001), with a significant reduction of time in moderate (p=0.002), and severe hypoglycemia (p=0.001), as well as the percentage of time in hyperglycemia (p<0.001). Glucose variability did not differ (p=0.863). The glucose management indicator was lower (p=0.001). 7% of youths reached the threshold-score (&#8805;115) for anxiety and 16% for depression. A higher score was associated with lower TIR [p=0.028, p=0.012]. CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic control improved during the first lockdown period with respect to the previous year. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with worse glycemic control; future researches are necessary to establish if this improvement is transient and if psychological difficulties will increase during the prolonged pandemic situation.","Cusinato, Maria; Martino, Mariangela; Sartori, Alex; Gabrielli, Claudia; Tassara, Laura; Debertolis, Giulia; Righetto, Elena; Moretti, Carlo",,,657
207523,Unsupervised Clustering of COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Images with a Self-Organizing Feature Map,2020,"BACKGROUND: Stainless-steel crowns (SSCs) are recommended for restorative treatment of young teeth severely affected by caries, fractures or dental developmental disorders (DDDs). However, despite recommendations and clinical evidence, SSCs are not widely used by general dentists, who favour extraction and more conventional restorations. The present study aimed to investigate the views of and use of SSCs among Norwegian and Finnish dentists. METHODS: The present study was a cross-sectional survey among Norwegian and Finnish dentists. An electronic questionnaire was sent to Norwegian and Finnish dentists asking whether they used SSCs and on which indications. In addition, the questionnaire assessed reasons for non-use and dentists' perceptions regarding advantages and challenges in the use of SSCs, as well as the need for additional training. Distributions of background characteristics, use of and views on SSCs were calculated, and statistical significance of the associations between respondents' background and their answers were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 574 Norwegian and 765 Finnish respondents, only 12.0% and 12.9% reported to use SSCs, respectively. The most frequently reported barrier reported by those who did not use SSCs was lack of practical training. The most frequent challenge reported by those using SSCs was difficulties in crown adjustment followed by aesthetic issues, and the most frequently reported advantage was that SSCs maintain the function and occlusion. The majority of respondents reported a need for more information and practical training in the use of SSCs, with hands-on course as their most frequently preferred education type. CONCLUSION: Although the value of SSCs for restoring young molars is recognized by Norwegian and Finnish dentists, SSCs are rarely used by general dentists. The majority of the respondents reported lack of training and materials and was interested in receiving more information and education.","Uhlen, M M; Tseveenjav, B; Wuollet, E; Furuholm, J; Ansteinsson, V; Mulic, A; Valen, H",BMC Oral Health,,657

The aim of this study was to explore the ways in which that first wave of novel coronavirus infections resulted in uncertainties, as experienced by members of the oral health care workforce in British Columbia, Canada. METHODS: This qualitative inquiry purposefully recruited frontline oral health care workers, including dentists, dental hygienists, certified dental assistants, and administrative staff, via remote semi-structured interviews between April 20 and May 4, 2020. Coding, categories, and themes were inductively assigned. RESULTS: A total of 45 interviews, lasting between 39 and 74 minutes each, were conducted involving 18 dentists (6 females), 12 dental hygienists (11 females), 6 certified dental assistants (all females), and 9 administrators/front-desk staff (7 females). Fifty-one hours of audio recordings and more than 650 single-spaced pages of transcripts were produced. Five main themes emerged pertaining to uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, patient care, personal lives and infectiousness, concern for the future, and variations among different pandemics. Certitudes were less evident, but surfaced mostly when considering a potential new normal resulting from the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Participants indicated that the uncertainties they felt were dependent upon what is known, and unknown, about the pandemic and the provision of oral health care during the first wave of infections. Future studies are needed to include the viewpoints of oral health care workers from other provinces, as well the perceptions of patients who received oral health care during the height of the first wave of the pandemic.","Brondani, Mario; Almeida, Fernanda; Cua, Denise; Maragha, Tala; Mathu-Muju, Kavita; Shayanfar, Melody; von Bergmann, HsingChi; Donnelly, Leeann",PLoS One,,657

In this paper, we perform careful experimental comparisons between shallow and deep networks for classification on two chest x-ray datasets, using different TL strategies.

Because human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, mice expressing the human ACE2 gene have shown promise as a potential model for COVID-19. Five mice from the transgenic mouse strain K18-hACE2 were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 Hong Kong/VM20001061/2020. Mice were followed twice daily for 5 days and scored for weight loss and clinical symptoms. Infected mice did not exhibit any signs of infection until day 4, when no other obvious clinical symptoms other than weight loss were observed. By day 5, all infected mice had lost around 10% of their original body weight but exhibited variable clinical symptoms. All infected mice showed high viral titers in the lungs as well as altered lung histology associated with proteinaceous debris in the alveolar space, interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration, and alveolar septal thickening. Overall, these results show that the K18-hACE2 transgenic background can be used to establish symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and can be a useful mouse model for COVID-19.","Moreau, Gregory Brett; Burgess, Stacey L; Sturek, Jeffrey M; Donlan, Alexandra N; Petri, William A; Mann, Barbara J",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,657

Beyond the decline in enrollment and lack of qualified language teachers, issues facing languages in US colleges and universities include the crisis in the humanities, the curriculum, and online learning. In a globalized world, the need for international education is evident. Advocacy is needed, including K-l 6 and interdisciplinary collaborations, to rebuild the number of foreign language learners so that there will be a sufficient number of students with the interests and skills to pursue pre-professional language studies at the postsecondary level. A national language policy would encourage language learning and reduce divisions within our increasingly multilingual society.

The authors adapted the June Objective Standardized Clinical Examination (OSCE) to a telehealth OSCE to preserve live faculty observation of students' skills and immediate feedback dialogue between students, standardized patients, and faculty members. The authors assessed students' reactions and comparative performance. Materials and Methods: OSCE and telehealth educators used draft Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) telehealth competencies to create educational materials and adapt OSCE cases. Students anonymously answered queries about the challenges of the telehealth encounters, confidence in basic telehealth competencies, and educational value of the experience. Cohort-level performance data were compared between the January in-person and June telehealth OSCEs. Results: One hundred sixty students participated in 29 Zoom® two-case telehealth OSCEs, equaling 58 h of assessment time. Survey response rate: 59%. Students indicated moderate challenge in adapting physical examinations to the telehealth format and indicated it to be cognitively challenging. Confidence in telehealth competencies was rated ""moderate"" to ""very,"" but was most pronounced for the technical aspects of telehealth, rather than safety engagement with a patient. Although authors found no significant difference in cohort-level performance in total scores and history-taking between the OSCEs, physical examination and communication scores differed between the two assessments. Discussion: It was feasible to adapt a standardized OSCE to a telehealth format when in-person clinical skills assessment was impossible. Students rated this necessary innovation positively, and it adequately assessed foundational clinical skills performance. Conclusion: Given future competency needs in telehealth, we suggest several education and training priorities.","Farrell, Susan E; Junkin, Andrew R; Hayden, Emily M",Telemed. j. e. health,,657

Integrating patients data with clinical trials data is enormously promising as it provides a comprehensive knowledge base that accelerates the clinical research response-ability to tackle emerging infectious disease outbreaks. This work introduces EMR2vec, a platform that customises advanced NLP, machine learning and semantic web techniques to link potential patients to suitable clinical trials. Linking these two different but complementary datasets allows clinicians and researchers to compare patients to clinical research opportunities or to automatically select patients for personalized clinical care. The platform derives a 'bag of medical terms' (BoMT) from eligibility criteria by normalizing extracted entities through SNOMED-CT ontology. With the usage of BoMT, an ontological reasoning method is proposed to represent EMR and clinical trials in a vector space model. The platform presents a matching process that reduces vector dimensionality using a neural network, then applies orthogonality projection to measure the similarity between vectors. Finally, the proposed EMR2vec platform is evaluated with an extendable prototype based on Big data tools.","Dhayne, Houssein; Kilany, Rima; Haque, Rafiqul; Taher, Yehia",Comput Ind Eng,,657
219158,COVID-19 diagnosis from CT scans and chest X-ray images using low-cost Raspberry Pi,2021,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to investigate the relation of severe COVID-19 to prior drug prescribing. METHODS: Severe cases were defined by entry to critical care or fatal outcome. For this matched case-control study (REACT-SCOT), all 4251 cases of severe COVID-19 in Scotland since the start of the epidemic were matched for age, sex and primary care practice to 36,738 controls from the population register. Records were linked to hospital discharges since June 2015 and dispensed prescriptions issued in primary care during the last 240 days. RESULTS: Severe COVID-19 was strongly associated with the number of non-cardiovascular drug classes dispensed. This association was strongest in those not resident in a care home, in whom the rate ratio (95% CI) associated with dispensing of 12 or more drug classes versus none was 10.8 (8.8, 13.3), and in those without any of the conditions designated as conferring increased risk of COVID-19. Of 17 drug classes postulated at the start of the epidemic to be ""medications compromising COVID"", all were associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 and these associations were present in those without any of the designated risk conditions. The fraction of cases in the population attributable to exposure to these drug classes was 38%. The largest effect was for antipsychotic agents: rate ratio 4.18 (3.42, 5.11). Other drug classes with large effects included proton pump inhibitors (rate ratio 2.20 (1.72, 2.83) for = 2 defined daily doses/day), opioids (3.66 (2.68, 5.01) for = 50 mg morphine equivalent/day) and gabapentinoids. These associations persisted after adjusting for covariates and were stronger with recent than with non-recent exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Severe COVID-19 is associated with polypharmacy and with drugs that cause sedation, respiratory depression, or dyskinesia; have anticholinergic effects; or affect the gastrointestinal system. These associations are not easily explained by co-morbidity. Measures to reduce the burden of mortality and morbidity from COVID-19 should include reinforcing existing guidance on reducing overprescribing of these drug classes and limiting inappropriate polypharmacy.

These challenges are illustrated by recent global efforts to conduct clinical trials of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) as a strategy for preventing COVID-19. Innovative strategies are needed to help overcome these issues, including increasing communication between the Data Safety and Monitoring Committees (DSMCs) of similar trials. It is important to reinforce the primacy of high-quality trials in generating unbiased answers to pressing prevention and treatment questions about COVID-19.","Tan, Darrell H S; Agrawal, Rupesh; Barnabas, Ruanne V; Giles, Jon T; Dull, Peter",Trials,,657
222457,CovidAID: COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-Ray,2020-04-21,"OBJECTIVES: There are concerns that public anxiety around COVID-19 discourages patients from seeking medical help. The aim of this study was to see how lockdown due to the pandemic affected the number of admissions of acute stroke. METHODS: All patients discharged from Akershus University Hospital with a diagnosis of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or acute stroke were identified by hospital chart review. January 3 to March 12 was defined as before, and March 13 to April 30 as during lockdown. RESULTS: There were 21.8 admissions/week before and 15.0 admissions/week during the lockdown (P < .01). Patients had on average higher NIHSS during the lockdown than before (5.9 vs. 4.2, P = .041). In the multivariable logistic regression model for ischemic stroke (adjusted for sex, age, living alone and NIHSS &#8804; 5), there was an increased OR of 2.05 (95% CI 1.10-3.83, P = .024) for not reaching hospital within 4.5 hours during the lockdown as compared to the period before the lockdown. CONCLUSION: There was a significant reduction in number of admissions for stroke and TIAs during the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway.","Kristoffersen, Espen Saxhaug; Jahr, Silje Holt; Thommessen, Bente; Rønning, Ole Morten",Acta neurol. scand,,657

As this disease continues to spread worldwide, it has posed enormous challenges on the healthcare of several diseases, especially cancer, because hospital facilities have invested health resources for patients with COVID-19. Indeed, patients with lung cancer are particularly vulnerable because of their poor baseline lung function and cancer-related treatment. In addition, once infected, they are at an increased risk of pulmonary complications from COVID-19. Oncologists are thus facing a challenge as how to balance the treatment plans to control the disease while protecting the patients with lung cancer from COVID-19. In fact, it is crucial to provide individualized treatment recommendations to limit the risks during these difficult times. This review highlights the key challenges that oncologists face when diagnosing COVID-19 among patients with lung cancer and examines the current recommendations from available literature, clinical expertise, and expert opinions regarding managing lung cancer in the era of COVID-19. It also explores the treatment approach recommended for patients with lung cancer while avoiding putting them at excessive risk of contracting COVID-19 infection.","Khalifeh, Yara Ibrahim; Tfayli, Arafat Hussein",Turk Thorac J,,657

We first need to understand if shutting down the economy helped. And if it did, is it possible to achieve similar gains in the war against the pandemic while partially opening up the economy? To do so, it is critical to understand the effects of the various interventions that can be put into place and their corresponding health and economic implications. Since many interventions exist, the key challenge facing policy makers is understanding the potential trade-offs between them, and choosing the particular set of interventions that works best for their circumstance. In this memo, we provide an overview of Synthetic Interventions (a natural generalization of Synthetic Control), a data-driven and statistically principled method to perform what-if scenario planning, i.e., for policy makers to understand the trade-offs between different interventions before having to actually enact them. In essence, the method leverages information from different interventions that have already been enacted across the world and fits it to a policy maker's setting of interest, e.g., to estimate the effect of mobility-restricting interventions on the U.S., we use daily death data from countries that enforced severe mobility restrictions to create a""synthetic low mobility U.S.""and predict the counterfactual trajectory of the U.S. if it had indeed applied a similar intervention. Using Synthetic Interventions, we find that lifting severe mobility restrictions and only retaining moderate mobility restrictions (at retail and transit locations), seems to effectively flatten the curve. We hope this provides guidance on weighing the trade-offs between the safety of the population, strain on the healthcare system, and impact on the economy.","Agarwal, Anish; Alomar, Abdullah; Sarker, Arnab; Shah, Devavrat; Shen, Dennis; Yang, Cindy",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00072v2.pdf,657

Beyond the dosage of immunosuppressive drugs, pharmacological immunosuppression may also alter the infection response in the COVID-19 course. The effects of immunosuppressive agents on the development and process of infection should not be decided only by determining how potent they are and how much they suppress the immune system; it is also thought that the direct effect of the virus, increased oxidative stress, and cytokine storm play a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease. There are data about immunosuppressive drugs like calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) therapy related to their beneficial effects during any infection course.

During the last years, this pathogen displayed multidrug resistance (MDR), mainly due to extensive antibiotic abuse and poor stewardship. MDR isolates are associated with medical history of long hospitalization stays, presence of catheters, and mechanical ventilation, while immunocompromised and severely ill hosts predispose to invasive infections. Next-generation sequencing techniques have revolutionized diagnosis of severe A. baumannii infections, contributing to timely diagnosis and personalized therapeutic regimens according to the identification of the respective resistance genes. The aim of this review is to describe in detail all current knowledge on the genetic background of A. baumannii resistance mechanisms in humans as regards beta-lactams (penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams, and beta-lactamase inhibitors), aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, lincosamides, streptogramin antibiotics, polymyxins, and others (amphenicols, oxazolidinones, rifamycins, fosfomycin, diaminopyrimidines, sulfonamides, glycopeptide, and lipopeptide antibiotics). Mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance refer mainly to regulation of antibiotic transportation through bacterial membranes, alteration of the antibiotic target site, and enzymatic modifications resulting in antibiotic neutralization. Virulence factors that may affect antibiotic susceptibility profiles and confer drug resistance are also being discussed. Reports from cases of A. baumannii coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of resistance profiles and MDR genes have been investigated.","Kyriakidis, Ioannis; Vasileiou, Eleni; Pana, Zoi Dorothea; Tragiannidis, Athanasios",,,657

The aim of this study was to reach a consensus among experts as to the possible applications of telemedicine in the proctologic field. METHODS: A group of 55 clinical practice recommendations was developed by a clinical guidance group based on coalescence of evidence and expert opinion. The Telemedicine in Proctology Italian Working Group included 47 Italian Society of Colorectal Surgery nominated experts evaluating the appropriateness of each clinical practice recommendations based on published RAND/UCLA methodology in 2 rounds. RESULTS: Stakeholder median age was 53 years (interquartile range limits 40-60), and 38 (81%) were men. Nine (19%) panelists reported no experience with telemedicine before the pandemic. Agreement was obtained on a minimum of 3 to 5 years of practice in the proctologic field before starting teleconsultations, which should be regularly paid, with advice and prescriptions incorporated into a formal report sent to the patient by e-mail along with a receipt. Of the panelists, 35 of 47 (74%) agreed that teleconsultation carries the risk of misdiagnosis of cancer, thus recommending an in-person assessment before scheduling any surgery. Fifteen additional clinical practice recommendations were re-elaborated in the second round and assessed by 44 of 47 (93.6%) panelists. The application of telemedicine for the diagnosis of common proctologic conditions (eg, hemorrhoidal disease, anal abscess and fistula, anal condylomas, and anal fissure) and functional pelvic floor disorders was generally considered inappropriate. Teleconsultation was instead deemed appropriate for the diagnosis and management of pilonidal disease. CONCLUSION: This e-consensus revealed the boundaries of telemedicine in Italy.

248857,A Conceptual Framework for Human–AI Hybrid Adaptivity in Education,2020,"Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for a timely update of health policies and allocation of resources. Particularly, serological testing may allow individuals with low-risk of being contagious of SARS-CoV-2 to return to daily activities. Both private and academic initiatives have sought to develop serological assays to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Herein, we compared five different assays in active healthcare personnel exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in a large center in Madrid, Spain, in a retrospective study. Median time lapse between polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) and serological testing was 11 days (7-21). All tests assessed IgM/IgG titers except for Euroimmun (IgA/IgG) and The Binding-Site (IgA/IgM/IgG). The highest concordance rate was observed between Dia.Pro and Euroimmun (75.76%), while it was lowest between The Binding-Site and Euroimmun (44.55%). The Binding-Site assay showed the highest concordance (85.52%) with PCR results. Considering PCR results as reference, Dia.Pro was the most sensitive test, although The Binding-Site assay exhibited the highest area under the curve (AUC;0.85). OrientGene and MAGLUMI tests were performed in a smaller cohort with confirmed infection and thus were not adequate to estimate sensitivity and specificity. The Binding-Site assay presented the best joint sensitivity and specificity among all the tests analyzed in our cohort. Likewise, this serological assay presents a greater repertoire of antibodies and antigen-regions tested, which is why each individual's humoral immunity is more accurately reflected. The better the immunity test, the most adequate the health strategy to take in terms of organization of consultations, surgery, and treatments in vulnerable patients. The three antibody classes (IgG/IgM/IgA) were determined jointly, which translates to an economic impact on healthcare. While their role in the protection status remains elusive, serological tests add a valuable tool in the early management of SARS-CoV-2 after known exposition.","Guevara-Hoyer, K.; Fuentes-Antras, J.; De la Fuente-Munoz, E.; Rodriguez de la Pena, A.; Vinuela, M.; Cabello-Clotet, N.; Estrada, V.; Culebras, E.; Delgado-Iribarren, A.; Martinez-Novillo, M.; Torrejon, M.

This paper compares the experiences of Brazil, Germany, India and the United States during their 2020 responses to the COVID-19 pandemic to show that social policies such as unemployment insurance, flat payments and short-time work are crucial to the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions as well as to their political sustainability. Broadly, public health measures that constrain economic activity will only be effective and sustainable if paired with social policy measures that enable people to comply without sacrificing their livelihoods and economic wellbeing. Tough public health policies and generous social policies taken together proved a success in Germany. Generous social policies uncoupled from strong public health interventions, in Brazil and the US during the summer of 2020, enabled lockdown compliance but failed to halt the pandemic, while tough public health measures without social policy support rapidly collapsed in India. In the COVID-19 and future pandemics, public health theory and practice should recognise the importance of social policy to the immediate effectiveness of public health policy as well as to the long-term social and economic impact of pandemics.","Greer, Scott L; Jarman, Holly; Falkenbach, Michelle; Massard da Fonseca, Elize; Raj, Minakshi; King, Elizabeth J",Glob Public Health,,657

The increasing rate of coronavirus infection in a developing country such as Bangladesh caused the highest death rate of doctors among frontline service providers and resulted in fear and anxiety among healthcare workers. Even with the preliminary measures of hospitals and clinics to protect healthcare workers, the growing casualties are alarming. This research uses case study approach to explore the issues doctors and nurses face in 'priority intervention areas' (PIA) in order to improve the health system quality. Qualitative in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted from 12 May to 4 June 2020 among doctors and nurses from two different private hospitals in Dhaka city. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. The two significant areas that required immediate attention were identified from the PIA framework as 'patient and staff safety, infection control' and 'cultural aspects and community engagement'. Each area of the PIA framework showed previously ignored issues in the current health system. The adaptation of the PIA framework helped identify critical health system issues. Possible corrective actions including proper planning and management of isolating the infected patients and provision of adequate personal protective equipment are recommended to management and policymakers to save the lives of healthcare workers and to minimise the spread of infection.","Hussain, Mehdi; Begum, Tahmina; Batul, Syeda A; Tui, Nastaran N; Islam, Md N; Hussain, Bashir",Int J Health Plann Manage,,657

SUMMARY: Two male patients, a 71-year-old and 62-year-old presented to the emergency department for symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Both patients were on long-term warfarin therapy with their most recent international normalized ratio (INR) prior to admission within their patient specific goal as managed by their outpatient Pharmacist. In both instances, the patients denied any changes in diet, lifestyle, or missed doses of medications upon admission interview. During admission, both patients experienced a marked elevation in INR within 24 to 48 hours of the initiation of remdesivir with dexamethasone for COVID-19 pneumonia directed therapy. The patients were both eventually stable and were instructed to continue warfarin monitoring and management under the direction of their outpatient Pharmacist upon discharge. CONCLUSION: The underrecognized but probable interaction between warfarin in conjunction with remdesivir and dexamethasone warrants further analysis.","Landayan, Ronald Patrick; Saint-Felix, Sampson; Williams, Ashley",J Pharm Pract,,657

Pregnant women and infants require particular concern, owing to the special immune conditions. A case of a pregnant woman who was exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at 34+1 weeks gestation and chose to continue pregnancy is reported. Without obvious symptoms or signs, the woman did not receive any treatment before delivery, and gave birth at 37+5 weeks to a neonate with positive immunoglobulin G for SARS-CoV-2 and negative nucleic acid tests. The mother was given anti-infection, oxytocin, and fluid rehydration treatment after delivery. Both mother and infant recovered well after a three-month follow-up. Continued expectation to deliver at term instead of preterm can decrease the potential risk of severe perinatal and infant complications and is beneficial to the development of the neonate.

Glutamine (Gln) and alanyl-glutamine (Ala-Gln) are nutrients with potential preservation functions similar to those of the intestinal epithelial barrier. The protective role of Gln and Ala-Gln on ZEN-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction was evaluated in this study. Additionally, the ability of Gln and Ala-Gln to protect the intestinal barrier was investigated. Our results showed that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, paracellular permeability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level were increased by ZEN, while the glutathione (GSH) level was decreased by ZEN. Gln and Ala-Gln promoted the proliferation of cells and attenuated the ZEN-induced increase in cytotoxicity, cell apoptosis and paracellular permeability. Gln and Ala-Gln alleviated barrier function damage, which was additionally induced by ZEN by increasing the antioxidant capacity of cells. In addition, Gln and Ala-Gln upregulated intestinal barrier associated gene expressions including pBD-1, pBD-2, MUC-2, ZO-1, occludin and claudin-3. This study revealed that Gln and Ala-Gln had similar effects in protecting intestinal epithelial barrier function against ZEN exposure in IPEC-J2 cells. A new treatment for alleviating ZEN-induced injury to the intestine through nutritional intervention is provided.","Gu, Aixin; Yang, Lige; Wang, Jingjing; Li, Jianping; Shan, Anshan",Res Vet Sci,,657

The study compared the effectiveness of Helpline ""Care Consultation"" and ""Care Consultation Plus"" conditions on caller outcomes. METHODS: Four hundred and forty-five non-crisis callers were randomly assigned to the traditional Helpline ""Care Consultation"" or a ""Care Consultation Plus"" condition that included one additional booster call. RESULTS: While no differences were found between the two conditions, the study found that callers reported significantly improved caregiver mental health scores (27 % net improvement over baseline) and ability to manage emotions (29 % net improvement) at one week (p = .006). By one week, 70 % of callers had put action steps in place and by 1 month 80 % of callers had put action steps into place. Over 80 % of callers reported action steps were ""helpful"". CONCLUSION: A single call provided a measurable benefit to caregivers'mental health, ability to manage emotions and ability to engage in action planning and accessing resources.

We extracted 167K of Cov19doms that have been registered between the end of December 2019 and the end of September 2020. We attempt to answer the following research questions through our measurement study: RQ1: Is the number of Cov19doms registrations correlated with the COVID-19 outbreaks?, RQ2: For what purpose do people register Cov19doms? Our chief findings are as follows: (1) Similar to the global COVID-19 pandemic observed around April 2020, the number of Cov19doms registrations also experienced the drastic growth, which, interestingly, pre-ceded the COVID-19 pandemic by about a month, (2) 70 % of active Cov19doms websites with visible content provided useful information such as health, tools, or product sales related to COVID-19, and (3) non-negligible number of registered Cov19doms was used for malicious purposes. These findings imply that it has become more challenging to distinguish domain names registered for legitimate purposes from others and that it is crucial to pay close attention to how Cov19doms will be used/misused in the future.","Kawaoka, Ryo; Chiba, Daiki; Watanabe, Takuya; Akiyama, Mitsuaki; Mori, Tatsuya",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05290v1.pdf,657

Yet the impact on mobility of different non-pharmaceutical countermeasures in the earlier stages of the pandemic is not well-understood. DESIGN: Trends were evaluated using Citymapper's mobility index covering 2nd to 26th March 2020, expressed as percentages of typical usage periods from 0% as the lowest and 100% as normal. China and India were not covered. Multivariate fixed effects models were used to estimate the association of policies restricting movement on mobility before and after their introduction. Policy restrictions were assessed using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index as well as measures coding the timing and degree of school and workplace closures, transport restrictions, and cancellation of mass gatherings. SETTING: 41 cities worldwide. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Citymapper's mobility index. RESULTS: Mobility declined in all major cities throughout March. Larger declines were seen in European than Asian cities. The COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index was strongly associated with declines in mobility (r = - 0.75, p < 0.001). After adjusting for time-trends, we observed that implementing non-pharmaceutical countermeasures was associated with a decline of mobility of 10.0% for school closures (95% CI: 4.36 to 15.7%), 15.0% for workplace closures (95% CI: 10.2 to 19.8%), 7.09% for cancelling public events (95% CI: 1.98 to 12.2%), 18.0% for closing public transport (95% CI: 6.74 to 29.2%), 13.3% for restricting internal movements (95% CI: 8.85 to 17.8%) and 5.30% for international travel controls (95% CI: 1.69 to 8.90). In contrast, as expected, there was no association between population mobility changes and fiscal or monetary measures or emergency healthcare investment. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the effect of public policy on mobility in the early stages is crucial to slowing and reducing COVID-19 transmission. By using Citymapper's mobility index, this work provides the first evidence about trends in mobility and the impacts of different policy interventions, suggesting that closure of public transport, workplaces and schools are particularly impactful.","Vannoni, Matia; McKee, Martin; Semenza, Jan C; Bonell, Chris; Stuckler, David",Global Health,,657

STUDY DESIGN: Clinical, prospective study. ANIMALS: Eight healthy, skeletally mature horses. METHODS: In vitro-serial dilutions of CHD-EDTA-Tris and EDTA-Tris alone were evaluated for bactericidal and fungicidal activity against Aspergillus fumigatus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus equi subspecies ssp. equi, Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In vivo-eight healthy horses were topically treated twice with 30 ml of 0.0005% CHD-EDTA-Tris. Mucosal samples from each location were evaluated for the presence of inflammation or pathologic lesions. RESULTS: Solutions containing CHD were superior in fungal and bacterial killing to those without. In vitro-a 0.005% CHD-EDTA-Tris was 100% effective against all bacterial and fungal species evaluated, while a 0.0005% CHD-EDTA-Tris was less efficacious against A. fumigatus and S. equi ssp. equi.

Here, we describe a high-throughput approach - Concept-Wide Association Study (ConceptWAS) - that systematically scans a disease's clinical manifestations from clinical notes. We used this method to identify symptoms specific to COVID-19 early in the course of the pandemic. METHODS: We created a natural language processing pipeline to extract concepts from clinical notes in a local ER corresponding to the PCR testing date for patients who had a COVID-19 test and evaluated these concepts as predictors for developing COVID-19. We identified predictors from Firth's logistic regression adjusted by age, gender, and race. We also performed ConceptWAS using cumulative data every two weeks to identify the timeline for recognition of early COVID-19-specific symptoms. RESULTS: We processed 87,753 notes from 19,692 patients subjected to COVID-19 PCR testing between March 8, 2020, and May 27, 2020 (1,483 COVID-19-positive). We found 68 concepts significantly associated with a positive COVID-19 test. We identified symptoms associated with increasing risk of COVID-19, including ""anosmia"" (odds ratio [OR] = 4.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.21-7.50), ""fever"" (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.28-1.59), ""cough with fever"" (OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.75-2.96), and ""ageusia"" (OR = 5.18, 95% CI = 3.02-8.58).

OBJECTIVES: To describe the outcomes of an ED triage system for non-severe patients with suspected COVID-19 and possible pneumonia based on chest X-ray (CXR) upon admission. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective, single-center study performed in Barcelona (Spain) during the COVID-19 peak in March-April 2020. Patients with COVID-19 symptoms and potential pneumonia, without respiratory insufficiency, with priority class IV-V (Andorran triage model) had a CXR upon admission. This approach tried to optimize resource use and to facilitate discharges. The results after adopting this organizational approach are reported. RESULTS: We included 834 patients, 53% were female. Most patients were white (66%) or Hispanic (27%). CXR showed pneumonia in 523 (62.7%). Compared to those without pneumonia, patients with pneumonia were older (55 vs 46.6 years old) and had a higher Charlson comorbidity index (1.9 vs 1.3). Patients with pneumonia were at a higher risk for a combined outcome of admission and/or death (91 vs 12%). Death rates tended to be numerically higher in the pneumonia group (10 vs 1). Among patients without pneumonia in the initial CXR, 10% reconsulted (40% of them with new pneumonia). CONCLUSION: CXR identified pneumonia in a significant number of patients.

The dynamics of the droplets is governed by the Maxey-Riley equation with Basset-Boussinesq history term neglected. We find that, in the absence of gravity, there are two distinct behaviours for the droplets: small droplets cannot go further than a specific distance, which we determine analytically, from the source before getting pulled into the sink. Larger droplets can travel further from the source before getting pulled into the sink by virtue of their larger inertia, and their maximum travelled distance is determined analytically. We investigate the effects of gravity, and we find that there are three distinct droplet behaviours categorised by their relative sizes: small, intermediate-sized, and large. Counterintuitively, we find that the droplets with minimum horizontal range are neither small nor large, but of intermediate size. Furthermore, we show that in conditions of regular human respiration, these intermediate-sized droplets range from a few $\mu$m to a few hundred $\mu$m. The result that such droplets have a very short range could have important implications for the interpretation of existing data on droplet dispersion.","Cummins, Cathal; Ajayi, Olayinka; Mehendale, Felicity; Gabl, Roman; Viola, Ignazio Maria",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05298v1.pdf,657

Five different types of falsified chloroquine tablets were discovered between March 31, 2020 and April 4, 2020, in Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo by locally conducted thin layer chromatographic analysis. Subsequent investigation by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry in Germany proved the absence of detectable amounts of chloroquine and the presence of undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients, that is, paracetamol and metronidazole, in four of the samples. The fifth sample contained chloroquine, but only 22% of the declared amount. Such products represent a serious risk to patients. Their occurrence exemplifies that once medicines or vaccines against COVID-19 may be developed, falsified products will enter the market immediately, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Timely preparations for the detection of such products are required, including the establishment of appropriate screening technologies in LMICs.","Gnegel, Gesa; Hauk, Cathrin; Neci, Richard; Mutombo, Georges; Nyaah, Fidelis; Wistuba, Dorothee; Häfele-Abah, Christine; Heide, Lutz",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,657
265949,Blockchain-Federated-Learning and Deep Learning Models for COVID-19 detection using CT Imaging,2021,"BACKGROUND: Available data suggest that the obstetric population is particularly vulnerable to severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, with a variable clinical course leading to severe respiratory failure. However, established early warning scores designed to identify patients at risk of clinical deterioration were never validated in the obstetric population. OBJECTIVE: This retrospective cohort study sought to evaluate the initial clinical characteristics of pregnant patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and to develop a pregnancy-specific early warning score to identify patients at risk for clinical deterioration and requiring advanced respiratory support. STUDY DESIGN: This was a single center, retrospective cohort study of pregnant patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection between April 2020 and December 2020. A total of 50 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection between April 2020 and November 2020 were used to create the prediction model. Initial clinical characteristics identified at the time of diagnosis were compared between patients who required advanced respiratory support and those who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms for those diagnosed during the period of April 2020 to November 2020. Risk factors associated with a requirement for advanced respiratory support were used to create the Obstetric Warning Score system. The Obstetric Warning Score system was then validated using 30 patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in December 2020. A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated to evaluate the test characteristics of the Obstetric Warning Score system compared with other scoring systems including the Early Warning Score, the National Early Warning Score 2, and the Maternal Early Warning Criteria. RESULTS: Women who required advanced respiratory support were more likely to present with dyspnea (100% vs 33.3%; P<.001), have a higher heart rate (113.4 beats per minute vs 93 beats per minute; P<.001), respiratory rate (23.5 breaths per minute vs 17.7 breaths per minute; P<.001), temperature (99.1°F vs 98.3°F; P=.004), and C-reactive protein level (7.4 mg/dL vs 2.4 mg/dL; P<.001). Furthermore, 88.2% of patients requiring advanced respiratory support showed chest x-ray findings consistent with pneumonia, compared with 20.0% of the patients not requiring advanced respiratory support (P<.001). All patients requiring advanced respiratory support presented with at least 1 coronavirus disease 2019 symptom, whereas only 51.5% of patients not requiring advanced respiratory support were symptomatic (P<.001). The Obstetrical Warning Score model allocated 1 point each for a hazard ratio of >100 beats per minute, temperature of >99.0°F, C-reactive protein level of >2.0 mg/dL, respiratory rate between 20 and 24 breaths per minute, complaints of dyspnea, and a positive chest x-ray. A respiratory rate of >24 breaths per minute was assigned 2 points. The area under the curve for the Obstetric Warning Score system was 0.97 compared with 0.72 for the Early Warning Score system, 0.92 for the National Early Warning Score 2 system, and 0.85 for the Maternal Early Warning Criteria system. An Obstetric Warning Score of &#8805;3 was predictive of a requirement for advanced respiratory support with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity 64%, and a positive predictive value of 36%. CONCLUSION: The Obstetric Warning Score system presents a validated method for providers to identify pregnant patients who are at risk for respiratory failure and a requirement for advanced respiratory support.","Yao, Ruofan; Martin, Courtney B; Haase, Victoria S; Tse, Beverly C; Nishino, Melissa; Gheorghe, Ciprian; Balli, Kevin",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,,657

Over 10 million people were confirmed with COVID-19 infection. The well-known spot of primary infection includes the lungs and the respiratory system. Recently it has been reported that the cardiovascular system and coagulation mechanisms were the second major targets of biological system affected due to the viral replication. The replication mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 involves the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2- (ACE2) surface receptors of endothelial cells belonging to various organs which act as the binding site for the viral spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 virus has been recently listed as a primary risk factor for the following cardiovascular conditions such as pericarditis, myocarditis, arrhythmias, myocardial injury, cardiac arrest, heart failure and coagulation abnormalities in the patients confirmed with COVID-19 viral infection. Direct and indirect type of tissue damage were the two major categories detected with cardiovascular abnormalities. Direct myocardial cell injury and indirect damage to the myocardial cell due to inflammation were clinically reported. Few drugs were clinically administered to regulate the vital biological mechanism along with symptomatic treatment and supportive therapy.","Raghavan, S.; Gayathri, R.; Kancharla, S.; Kolli, P.; Ranjitha, J.; Shankar, V.",Front Cardiovasc Med,,657

To date, there have been minimal longitudinal studies in hemodialysis patients to ascertain whether protection offered by vaccination is long-lasting. To assess how surrogates for protection changed over time, we examined both the humoral and cellular response in a previously reported cohort of at-risk hemodialysis patients and healthy donors, four months after their second dose of Pfizer BNT162b2. Compared to three weeks post-second vaccination, both cellular and humoral responses against the original SARS-CoV-2 isolate as well as variants of concern were significantly reduced, with some dialyzed individuals having no B- or T-cell response.

Intracellular precipitation of ACC, requires [Formula: see text] concentrating as well as proton export mechanisms to promote calcification. These processes are of fundamental importance in biological mineralization, but remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the calcifying primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) use Na+/H+-exchange (NHE) mechanisms to control cellular pH homeostasis during maintenance of the skeleton. During skeleton re-calcification, pHi of PMCs is increased accompanied by substantial elevation in intracellular [Formula: see text] mediated by the [Formula: see text] cotransporter Sp_Slc4a10. However, PMCs lower their pHi regulatory capacities associated with a reduction in NHE activity. Live-cell imaging using green fluorescent protein reporter constructs in combination with intravesicular pH measurements demonstrated alkaline and acidic populations of vesicles in PMCs and extensive trafficking of large V-type H+-ATPase (VHA)-rich acidic vesicles in blastocoelar filopodial cells. Pharmacological and gene expression analyses underline a central role of the VHA isoforms Sp_ATP6V0a1, Sp_ATP6V01_1 and Sp_ATPa1-4 for the process of skeleton re-calcification. These results highlight novel pH regulatory strategies in calcifying cells of a marine species with important implications for our understanding of the mineralization process in times of rapid changes in oceanic pH.","Hu, Marian Y; Petersen, Inga; Chang, William Weijen; Blurton, Christine; Stumpp, Meike",Proc Biol Sci,,657

Data time horizon ranges from 26 February 20020, which is the date when the first case not directly connected with China has been discovered in northern Italy, to 18 March 2020. An endemic-epidemic multivariate time-series mixed-effects generalized linear model for areal disease counts has been implemented to understand and predict spatio-temporal diffusion of the phenomenon. Previous literature has shown that these class of models provide reliable predictions of infectious diseases in time and space. Three subcomponents characterize the estimated model. The first is related to the evolution of the disease over time; the second is characterized by transmission of the illness among inhabitants of the same province; the third remarks the effects of spatial neighbourhood and try to capture the contagion effects of nearby areas. Focusing on the aggregated time-series of the daily counts in Italy, the contribution of any of the three subcomponents do not dominate on the others and our predictions are excellent for the whole country, with an error of 3 per thousand compared to the late available data. At local level, instead, interesting distinct patterns emerge. In particular, the provinces first concerned by containment measures are those that are not affected by the effects of spatial neighbours. On the other hand, for the provinces the are currently strongly affected by contagions, the component accounting for the spatial interaction with surrounding areas is prevalent. Moreover, the proposed model provides good forecasts of the number of infections at local level while controlling for delayed reporting.","Giuliani, Diego; Dickson, Maria Michela; Espa, Giuseppe; Santi, Flavio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06664v2.pdf,657

RESULTS: Among 94 laboratory test variables in 82 survivors and 25 non-survivors with COVID-19, white blood cell count, neutrophil count/percentage, mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, platelet-large cell percentage, hypersensitive C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer, fibrin (ogen) degradation product, middle fluorescent reticulocyte percentage, immature reticulocyte fraction, lactate dehydrogenase were significantly increased (P < 0.05), and lymphocyte count/percentage, monocyte percentage, eosinophil percentage, prothrombin activity, low fluorescent reticulocyte percentage, plasma carbon dioxide, total calcium, prealbumin, total protein, albumin, albumin-globulin ratio, cholinesterase, total cholesterol, nonhigh-density/low-density/small-dense-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly decreased in non-survivors compared with survivors (P < 0.05), in both first and last tests. Prothrombin time, prothrombin international normalized ratio, nucleated red blood cell count/percentage, high fluorescent reticulocyte percentage, plasma uric acid, plasma urea nitrogen, cystatin C, sodium, phosphorus, magnesium, myoglobin, creatine kinase (isoenzymes), aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, triglyceride were significantly increased (P < 0.05), and eosinophil count, basophil percentage, platelet count, thrombocytocrit, antithrombin III, red blood cell count, haemoglobin, haematocrit, total carbon dioxide, acidity-basicity, actual bicarbonate radical, base excess in the extracellular fluid compartment, estimated glomerular filtration rate, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1/ B were significantly decreased in non-survivors compared with survivors (P < 0.05), only in the last tests. Temporal changes in 26 variables, such as lymphocyte count/percentage, neutrophil count/percentage, and platelet count, were obviously different between survivors and non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS: By the comprehensive usage of the laboratory markers with different temporal changes, patients with a high risk of COVID-19-associated death or progression from mild to severe disease might be identified, allowing for timely targeted treatment.","Ouyang, Song-Mao; Zhu, Hong-Quan; Xie, Ying-Na; Zou, Zhi-Sheng; Zuo, Hui-Min; Rao, Yun-Wei; Liu, Xiao-Yan; Zhong, Bin; Chen, Xin",BMC Infect Dis,,657
279446,MCNN: A deep learning based rapid diagnosis method for COVID-19 from the X-ray images,2020,"In the context of the COVID‐19 pandemic, personal protective measures (e.g., social distancing, handwashing, and mask wearing) have been adopted as a cornerstone to limit the spread of the disease. Yet, the effectiveness of these measures depends on people's levels of adherence. In this article, we apply social‐psychological research to the study of compliance with personal protective measures during the COVID‐19 pandemic in Chile. We consider three possible models underlying adherence: (1) sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors, (2) instrumental factors, and (3) normative factors. We draw on data from a longitudinal nonrepresentative panel study (Study 1, n = 32,304) and a cross‐sectional representative survey (Study 2, n = 1,078) to explore the impact of these different factors on personal protective measures compliance. Findings show the strongest support for the role of instrumental and normative factors, in that people who comply with protective measures report to a greater extent that relatives and friends comply too and tend to perceive high risk of COVID‐19. We finish by proposing policy recommendations to promote effective strategies to contain the spread of the virus.

METHODS: In patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with an enclosure covering their heads, 0.3-10-µm aerosols were measured for 60 seconds before, during, and after endoscopy by an optical counter. Whether aerosols increased in the situation with and without endoscopy was examined. RESULTS: The analysis included 103 consecutive patients undergoing endoscopy and 90 control patients. Aerosols increased significantly during endoscopy compared with the control group. Body mass index and burping were significant factors related to increased aerosols during endoscopy.

Some variants are currently considered of great concern. We aimed to analyze the numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences obtained in different countries worldwide until January 2021. On 28 January 2021, we downloaded the deposited genome sequence origin from the GISAID database, and from the ""Our world in data"" website we downloaded numbers of SARS-CoV-2-diagnosed cases, numbers of SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths, population size, life expectancy, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and human development index per country. Files were merged and data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel software. A total of 450,968 SARS-CoV-2 genomes originating from 135 countries on the 5 continents were available. When considering the 19 countries for which the number of genomes per 100 deaths was &gt;100, six were in Europe, while eight were in Asia, three were in Oceania and two were in Africa. Six (30%) of these countries are beyond rank 75, regarding the human development index and four (20%) are beyond rank 80 regarding GDP per capita. Moreover, the comparisons of the number of genomes sequenced per 100 deaths to the human development index by country show that some Western European countries have released similar or lower numbers of genomes than many African or Asian countries with a lower human development index. Previous data highlight great discrepancies between the numbers of available SARS-CoV-2 genomes per 100 cases and deaths and the ranking of countries regarding wealth and development.","Colson, P.; Raoult, D.",Viruses,,657

The proposed PSOSMA-ANFIS has been trained with air quality index time series data of three years and has been applied to forecast the fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for one year. We also compared the proposed PSOSMA to other MH algorithms used to train ANFIS. We found that the modified ANFIS using PSOSMA achieved better performance than compared algorithms. Moreover, we analyzed the impacts of the lockdown of Wuhan City on the concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, CO2, and SO2. We compared the correspondence period with previous years, and we concluded that there are significant decreases in the concentrations of PM2.5, CO2, SO2, and NO2.","Al-Qaness, Mohammed A A; Fan, Hong; Ewees, Ahmed A; Yousri, Dalia; Abd Elaziz, Mohamed",Environ Res,,657

Methods: We retrospectively collected data for each patient with a positive SARSCoV-2 RT PCR between 18th March and the 20th April 2020 in a department of medicine for the elderly in Glasgow. Results: 222 patients were included in our analysis.

300180,COVID-19: Automatic Detection from X-ray images by utilizing Deep Learning Methods,2021,"BACKGROUND: Upper respiratory tract infections are common, and the ability to accurately and rapidly diagnose the causative pathogen has important implications for patient management. METHODS: We evaluated the test-ordering practices for 2 commonly utilized nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for the detection of respiratory pathogens: the Xpert Flu Assay for influenza A/B (Flu assay) and the Biofire FilmArray respiratory panel assay (RP assay), which detects 20 different targets. Our study examined repeat testing; that is, testing within 7 days from an initial test. RESULTS: Our study found that repeat testing is common for each of the individual assays: 3.0% of all Flu assays and 10.0% of all RP assays were repeat testing. Of repeat testing, 8/293 (2.7%) of repeat Flu assays and 75/1257 (6.0%) of RP assays resulted diagnostic gains, i.e., new detections. However, for the RP assay, these new detections were not always clinically actionable. The most frequently discrepant organisms were rhinovirus/enterovirus (28/102, 27.5%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (12/102, 11.8%) and coronavirus OC43 (11/102, 10.8%). Furthermore, there were 3,336 instances in which a patient was tested using both a Flu assay and RP assay, of which only 44 (1.3%) had discrepant influenza results. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest opportunities exist to better guide ordering practices for respiratory pathogen testing, including limiting repeat testing, with the goal of optimization of clinical yield, and diagnostic stewardship.","Qavi, Abraham J; McMullen, Allison; Burnham, Carey-Ann D; Anderson, Neil W",J Appl Lab Med,,657
300911,Effect of restricted emissions during COVID-19 on air quality in India,2020,"Electrical stimulation of nerve endings in the tongue can be used to communicate information to users and has been shown to be highly effective in sensory substitution applications. The anterior tip of the tongue has very small somatosensory receptive fields, comparable to those of the finger tips, allowing for precise two-point discrimination and high tactile sensitivity. However, perception of electrotactile stimuli varies significantly between users, and across the tongue surface. Despite this, previous studies all used uniform electrode grids to stimulate a region of the dorsal-medial tongue surface. In an effort to customize electrode layouts for individual users, and thus improve efficacy for sensory substitution applications, we investigated whether specific neuroanatomical and physiological features of the tongue are associated with enhanced ability to perceive active electrodes. Specifically, the study described here was designed to test whether fungiform papillae density and/or propylthiouracil sensitivity are positively or negatively associated with perceived intensity and/or discrimination ability for lingual electrotactile stimuli. Fungiform papillae number and distribution were determined for 15 participants and they were exposed to patterns of electrotactile stimulation (ETS) and asked to report perceived intensity and perceived number of stimuli. Fungiform papillae number and distribution were then compared to ETS characteristics using comprehensive and rigorous statistical analyses. Our results indicate that fungiform papillae density is correlated with enhanced discrimination ability for electrical stimuli. In contrast, papillae density, on average, is not correlated with perceived intensity of active electrodes. However, results for at least one participant suggest that further research is warranted. Our data indicate that propylthiouracil taster status is not related to ETS perceived intensity or discrimination ability. These data indicate that individuals with higher fungiform papillae number and density in the anterior medial tongue region may be better able to use lingual ETS for sensory substitution.","Allison, Tyler S; Moritz, Joel; Turk, Philip; Stone-Roy, Leslie M",PLoS One,,657

A kérdés fontosságának a COVID-19-pandémia különös aktualitást ad. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(3): 83-90. Summary. Revealing the health effects associated with smoking has been in the focus of intense research for decades. Due to these research efforts, there is a convincing evidence regarding the negative effects of conventional cigarettes. However, much less is known about the replacement products such as electronic cigarettes. Moreover, the effects of waterpipes are also not fully explored, in spite of their long history. The scope of the present work is to survey the open literature to map the knowledge related to the health effects of conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes and waterpipes. The analysis of the related scientific literature was performed based on papers retrieved in large publication repositories. Based on the reviewed literature, long-term smoking has demonstrated adverse effects on the respiratory as well as the heart and circulatory systems. In addition, the correlation between cigarette smoking and some gastroenterological and neurological diseases is also increasingly evident. By the same token, though the acute effects of e-cigarette and waterpipe are well documented, the protracted effects are still to be explored.

304563,Modeling and forecasting of epidemic spreading: The case of Covid-19 and beyond,2020,"Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) and interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) lie sequentially on a signaling pathway activated by ligands of the IL-1 receptor and/or multiple TLRs located either on plasma or endosomal membranes. Activated IRF5, in conjunction with other synergistic transcription factors, notably NF-&#954;B, is crucially required for the production of proinflammatory cytokines in the innate immune response to microbial infection. The IRAK4-IRF5 axis could therefore have a major role in the induction of the signature cytokines and chemokines of the hyperinflammatory state associated with severe morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Here a case is made for considering IRAK4 or IRF5 inhibitors as potential therapies for the ""cytokine storm"" of COVID-19.","Stoy, Nicholas",Front Immunol,,657
304713,Data Driven Modelling of Coronavirus Spread in Spain,2020,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an economically important pathogen that has evolved several mechanisms to evade type I IFN responses. Type III interferon (IFN-λ), an innate cytokine that primarily targets the mucosal epithelia, is critical in fighting mucosal infection in the host and has been reported to potently inhibit PEDV infection in vitro. However, how PEDV escapes IFN-λ antiviral response remains unclear. In this study, we found that PEDV infection induced significant IFN-λ expression in type I IFN-defective Vero E6 cells, but virus-induced endogenous IFN-λ did not reduce PEDV titers. Moreover, we demonstrated that PEDV escaped IFN-λ responses by substantially upregulating the suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 1 (SOCS1) expression, which impaired the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and dampened the IFN-λ antiviral response and facilitated PEDV replication in Vero E6 cells. We further showed that PEDV infection increased SOCS1 expression by decreasing host miR-30c-5p expression. MiR-30c-5p suppressed SOCS1 expression through targeting the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of SOCS1. The inhibition of IFN-λ elicited ISGs expression by SOCS1 was specifically rescued by overexpression of miR-30c-5p. Collectively, our findings identify a new strategy by PEDV to escape IFN-λ-mediated antiviral immune responses by engaging the SOCS1/miR-30c axis, thus improving our understanding of its pathogenesis.","Wang, Changlin; Shan, Lingling; Qu, Shuxin; Xue, Mei; Wang, Keliang; Fu, Fang; Wang, Lu; Wang, Ziqi; Feng, Li; Xu, Wanhai; Liu, Pinghuang",Front.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, and at least half of the top 10 leading causes of death have been associated with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). A number of established risk factors for suicide and ACEs may have been exacerbated by the pandemic, including loneliness and the lack of connectedness. METHOD: This article briefly considers the effects of COVID-19 on social connection and outlines the importance of adapting and developing programming and resources that address suicide and ACEs prevention during a time of infrastructure disruption. Practical Applications: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the ways that many individuals are able to safely interact and socially connect due to public health prevention strategies implemented to slow the spread of COVID-19. Local, city, and state government, community organizations, and public health and medical practitioners should consider the adaptation and development of existing and new programming, resources, and activities that support and strengthen social connection. In addition to implementing programs, policies may help address systemic and structural barriers to social connection, such as access to parks and open space, public transportation, or digital connectivity.","Bledsoe, Martevia; Captanian, Alexis; Somji, Alisha",J Safety Res,,657

RESULTS: We compared IMD cases received at the French National Reference Centre for meningococci and Haemophilus influenzae that are sent as part of the mandatory reporting of IMD. We compared these data during the period 01 January-15 May 2020 to those from the same period in 2018 and 2019. IMD cases that were associated with respiratory presentations significantly increased in 2020 compared to 2018 (P = 0.029) and 2019 (P = 0.002), involved elderly and were due to unusual isolates. However, IMD cases due to hyperinvasive isolates decreased during the lockdown.

Cyclic ß2,3-amino acids (cßAAs), such as 2-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (2-ACHC), are strong helix/turn inducers due to their restricted conformations. Here we report the ribosomal synthesis of foldamer peptides that contain multiple, up to ten, consecutive cßAAs via genetic code reprogramming. We also report the de novo discovery of macrocyclic cßAA-containing peptides capable of binding to a protein target. As a demonstration, potent binders with low-to-subnanomolar KD values were identified for human factor XIIa (hFXIIa) and interferon-gamma receptor 1, from a library of their 1012 members. One of the anti-hFXIIa macrocyclic peptides that exhibited a high inhibitory activity and serum stability was co-crystallized with hFXIIa. The X-ray structure revealed that it adopts an antiparallel ß-sheet structure induced by a (1S,2S)-2-ACHC residue via the formation of two Î³-turns.

Some patients showing severe symptoms exhibit drastic inflammation and airway damage. In this study, we re-analyzed published scRNA-seq data of COVID-19 patient bronchoalveolar lavage fluid to further classify and compare immunological features according to the patient's disease severity. Patients with severe symptoms showed DNA damage and apoptotic features of epithelial cells. Our results suggested that epithelial damage was associated with neutrophil infiltration. Myeloid cells of severe patients showed higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as CXCL8. As a result, neutrophils were abundant in lungs of patients from the severe group. Furthermore, recruited neutrophils highly expressed genes related to neutrophil extracellular traps. Neutrophil-mediated inflammation was regulated by glucocorticoid receptor expression and activity. Based on these results, we suggest that severe COVID-19 symptoms may be determined by differential expression of glucocorticoid receptors and neutrophils.","Park, Jang Hyun; Lee, Heung Kyu",Front Immunol,,657
311847,Design and simulation of mechanical ventilators,2021,"Human C5a (hC5a), one of the pro-inflammatory glycoproteins of the complement system is known to undergo production hyperdrive in response to stress and infection. hC5a has been associated with the pathogenesis of many chronic and acute diseases, due to its proven ability in triggering the 'cytokine storm', by binding to its cognate receptor C5aR, expressed in myriad of tissues. Given the pleiotropic downstream function of hC5a, it is logical to consider the hC5a or its precursors as potential drug targets, and thus, we have been rationally pursuing the idea of neutralizing the harmful effect of excessive hC5a, by implementing the repurposing strategies for FDA-approved drugs. Indeed, the proof of principle biophysical studies published recently is encouraging, which strongly supports the potential of this strategy. Considering BSA-carprofen as a reference model system, the current study further explores the inherent conformational plasticity of hC5a and its effect in accommodating more than one drug molecule cooperatively at multiple sites. The data generated by recruiting a battery of experimental and computational biology techniques strongly suggest that hC5a can sequentially accommodate more than one raloxifene molecule with an estimated Ki â¼ 0.5 µM and Ki â¼ 3.58 µM on its surface at non-analogous sites. The study hints at exploration of polypharmacology approach, as a new avenue for discovering synergistic drug molecule pairs, or drug molecules with 'broad-range' binding affinity for targeting the different 'hot spots' on hC5a, as an alternative combination therapy for possible management of the 'cytokine storm'-related inflammatory diseases, like COVID19.

METHODS: Data from 12,328 adults who responded to the cross-sectional survey conducted in 33 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean by Pan American Health Organization were used. Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the effect of the sociodemographic characteristics, quarantine practices, and anxiety symptoms on the increase in frequency of HED among the 2019 drinkers. RESULTS: 65 % of drinkers in 2019 self-reported HED during the COVID-19 pandemic with 13.8 % of the drinkers reporting an increase in HED compared to a 33.38 % decrease in HED. Multivariable analysis indicated that male gender (aOR 1.29, 95 %CI 1.13; 1.49), higher income (aOR 1.64, 95 %CI 1.35; 1.99) and higher level of quarantine practices (aOR 1.10, 95 %CI 1.04; 1.16) were positively associated with increased frequency of HED; unemployment (aOR 0.78, 95 %CI 0.64; 0.96), student status (aOR 0.53, 95 %CI 0.43; 0.64) and living with children (aOR 0.91, 95 %CI 0.84; 0.99) were negatively associated with increased frequency of HED. A gradient of association was found between generalized anxiety disorder and an increase in HED frequency during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Along with other measures to decrease the spread of COVID-19, it is important to include measures to reduce alcohol consumption and address mental health conditions in the national response to the pandemic.","Valente, Juliana Y; Sohi, Ivneet; Garcia-Cerde, Rodrigo; Monteiro, Maristela G; Sanchez, Zila M",Drug Alcohol Depend,,657

We characterized relationships between SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and disease severity, clinical deterioration, and specific EPCs. METHODS: We used quantitative (qPCR) and digital (dPCR) PCR to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA from plasma in 191 patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with COVID-19. We recorded patient symptoms, laboratory markers, and clinical outcomes, with a focus on oxygen requirements over time. We collected longitudinal plasma samples from a subset of patients. We characterized the role of RNAemia in predicting clinical severity and EPCs using elastic net regression. RESULTS: 23.0% (44/191) of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients had viral RNA detected in plasma by dPCR, compared to 1.4% (2/147) by qPCR. Most patients with serial measurements had undetectable RNAemia within 10 days of symptom onset, reached maximum clinical severity within 16 days, and symptom resolution within 33 days. Initially RNAaemic patients were more likely to manifest severe disease (OR 6.72 [95% CI, 2.45 - 19.79]), worsening of disease severity (OR 2.43 [95% CI, 1.07 - 5.38]), and EPCs (OR 2.81 [95% CI, 1.26 - 6.36]). RNA load correlated with maximum severity (r = 0.47 [95% CI, 0.20 - 0.67]). CONCLUSIONS: dPCR is more sensitive than qPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, which is a robust predictor of eventual COVID-19 severity and oxygen requirements, as well as EPCs. Since many COVID-19 therapies are initiated on the basis of oxygen requirements, RNAemia on presentation might serve to direct early initiation of appropriate therapies for the patients most likely to deteriorate.","Ram-Mohan, Nikhil; Kim, David; Zudock, Elizabeth J; Hashemi, Marjan M; Tjandra, Kristel C; Rogers, Angela J; Blish, Catherine A; Nadeau, Kari C; Newberry, Jennifer A; Quinn, James V; O039,; Hara, Ruth; Ashley, Euan; Nguyen, Hien; Jiang, Lingxia; Hung, Paul; Blomkalns, Andra L; Yang, Samuel",Clin. infect. dis,,657

In this study, the continuous measurements of aerosol light absorption were conducted in Nanjing, east China, from January 3 to March 31, 2020. Our results showed that the contribution of black carbon (BC) to light absorption at the different wavelengths was more than 75% and the rest light absorption was contributed by brown carbon (BrC), which was mainly originated from primary emissions. Secondary BrC absorption, which was mainly produced by photochemical oxidation, constituted a minor fraction (2-7%) of the total absorption. Compared with the sampling in the pre-lockdown, the significant decreases of BC (43%) and secondary BrC absorption (31%) were found during the lockdown period, resulting in a substantial decrease of solar energy absorbance by 36% on a local scale. The control measures also changed the diurnal variations of light absorption. Due to the reduced emissions, the relative fraction of fossil fuel to BC also dropped from 78% in the pre-lockdown to 71% in the lockdown. The concentrations of BC, PM2.5 and NO2 decreased 1.1 µg m-3, 33 µg m-3 and 9.1 ppb whereas O3 concentration increased 9.0 ppb during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The decreased concentrations of BC, PM2.5 and NO2 were mainly contributed by both emission reduction (51-64%) and meteorological conditions (36-49%). Our results highlighted that the balance of control measures in alleviation of particulate matter (PM) and O3 pollution, and meteorology should be seriously considered for improvement of air quality in this urban city of China.","Lin, Yu-Chi; Zhang, Yan-Lin; Xie, Feng; Fan, Mei-Yi; Liu, Xiaoyan",Environ Pollut,,657

In this retrospective study, we assessed the clinical effects of HCQ/AZI, with a 28-days follow-up. METHODS: In a registry-study which included patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 15 and April 2, 2020, we compared patients who received HCQ/AZI to those who did not, regarding a composite outcome of mortality and mechanical ventilation with a 28-days follow-up. QT was monitored for patients treated with HCQ/AZI. Were excluded patients in intensive care units, palliative care and ventilated within 24 hours of admission. Three analyses were performed to adjust for selection bias: propensity score matching, multivariable survival, and inverse probability score weighting (IPSW) analyses. RESULTS: Overall, 203 patients were included: 60 patients treated by HCQ/AZI and 143 control patients. During the 28-days follow-up, 32 (16.3%) patients presented the primary outcome and 23 (12.3%) patients died. Propensity-score matching identified 52 unique pairs of patients with similar characteristics. In the matched cohort (n = 104), HCQ/AZI was not associated with the primary composite outcome (log-rank p-value = 0.16).

However, only few circRNAs have been functionally characterized, and their role during aging has not been addressed. Here, we use transcriptome profiling during aging and find that accumulation of circRNAs is slowed down in long-lived insulin mutant flies. Next, we characterize the in vivo function of a circRNA generated by the sulfateless gene (circSfl), which is consistently upregulated, particularly in the brain and muscle, of diverse long-lived insulin mutants. Strikingly, lifespan extension of insulin mutants is dependent on circSfl, and overexpression of circSfl alone is sufficient to extend the lifespan. Moreover, circSfl is translated into a protein that shares the N terminus and potentially some functions with the full-length Sfl protein encoded by the host gene. Our study demonstrates that insulin signaling affects global circRNA accumulation and reveals an important role of circSfl during aging in vivo.","Weigelt, Carina Marianne; Sehgal, Rohan; Tain, Luke Stephen; Cheng, Jun; Eßer, Jacqueline; Pahl, André; Dieterich, Christoph; Grönke, Sebastian; Partridge, Linda",Mol Cell,,657

We aim to understand population level variation of nasopharyngeal ACE2 transcription in people tested for COVID-19 and the relationship between ACE2 transcription and SARS-CoV-2 viral load, while adjusting for expression of: (i) the complementary protease, Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), (ii) soluble ACE2, (iii) age, and (iv) biological sex. The ACE2 gene was targeted to measure expression of transmembrane and soluble transcripts. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of n = 424 ""participants"" aged 1-104 years referred for COVID-19 testing was performed in British Columbia, Canada. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were matched by age and biological sex to patients who tested negative. Viral load and host gene expression were assessed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Bivariate analysis and multiple linear regression were performed to understand the role of nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression in SARS-CoV-2 infection. FINDINGS: Analysis showed no association between age and nasopharyngeal ACE2 transcription in those who tested negative for COVID-19 (P = 0â¢092). Mean relative transcription of transmembrane (P = 0â¢00012) and soluble (P<0â¢0001) ACE2 isoforms, as well as TMPRSS2 (P<0â¢0001) was higher in COVID-19-negative participants than COVID--19 positive ones, yielding a negative correlation between targeted host gene expression and positive COVID-19 diagnosis. In bivariate analysis of COVID-19-positive participants, transcription of transmembrane ACE2 positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load (B = 0â¢49, R2=0â¢14, P<0â¢0001), transcription of soluble ACE2 negatively correlated (B= -0â¢85, R2= 0â¢26, P<0â¢0001), and no correlation was found with TMPRSS2 transcription (B= -0â¢042, R2=<0â¢10, P = 0â¢69). Multivariable analysis showed that the greatest viral RNA loads were observed in participants with high transmembrane ACE2 transcription (&#914;= 0â¢89, 95%CI: [0â¢59 to 1â¢18]), while transcription of the soluble isoform appears to protect against high viral RNA load in the upper respiratory tract (&#914;= -0â¢099, 95%CI: [-0â¢18 to -0â¢022]). INTERPRETATION: Nasopharyngeal ACE2 transcription plays a dual, contrasting role in SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper respiratory tract. Transcription of the transmembrane ACE2 isoform positively correlates, while transcription of the soluble isoform negatively correlates with viral RNA load after adjusting for age, biological sex, and transcription of TMPRSS2.

321331,Air quality variations in Northern South America during the COVID-19 lockdown,2020,"ABSTRACT: Postacute COVID-19 patients are at risk of long-term functional impairment, and the rehabilitation community is calling for action preparing for a ""tsunami of rehabilitation needs"" in this patient population. In the absence of standard guidelines and local evidence, a 3-wk pulmonary telerehabilitation program was successfully delivered to a postacute severe COVID-19 patient in Malawi. The patient experienced persistent dyspnea and fatigue, with a remarkable impact on his health status. On the final assessment, all his respiratory severity scores had fallen by more than their thresholds for clinical significance. He reported no continued or new complaints, was walking longer distances, had returned to work, and was discharged from follow-up. Our case shows that an improvised pulmonary telerehabilitation program for postacute COVID-19 patients could be feasible and acceptable in a low-resource setting. Benefits include reducing risk of transmission and use of personal protective equipment.","Bickton, Fanuel Meckson; Chisati, Enock; Rylance, Jamie; Morton, Ben",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,,657
325217,Deep-COVID: Predicting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using deep transfer learning,2020,"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin may reduce mortality in patients with viral respiratory diseases, and are being investigated as potential therapies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding benefits and risks of these interventions is required. OBJECTIVES: Using a living systematic review approach, to assess whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19; and to maintain the currency of the evidence. SEARCH METHODS: To identify completed and ongoing studies, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, the Epistemonikos COVID-19 L*OVE Platform, and trial registries. Searches were done on 17 March 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. For safety assessments, we also included non-controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) if 500 or more participants were included. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)), as well as studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of Bias 2' tool for RCTs, and for NRSIs, the assessment criteria for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer. We rated the certainty of evidence, using the GRADE approach, for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, improvement and worsening of clinical status (for individuals with moderate to severe disease), development of severe clinical COVID-19 symptoms (for individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease), quality of life (including fatigue and functional independence), grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 studies (12 RCTs, 1 NRSI) with 48,509 participants, of whom 41,880 received convalescent plasma. We did not identify any completed studies evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. We identified a further 100 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin, and 33 studies reporting as being completed or terminated. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease Eleven RCTs and one NRSI investigated the use of convalescent plasma for 48,349 participants with moderate to severe disease. Nine RCTs compared convalescent plasma to placebo treatment or standard care alone, and two compared convalescent plasma to standard plasma (results not included in abstract). Effectiveness of convalescent plasma We included data on nine RCTs (12,875 participants) to assess the effectiveness of convalescent plasma compared to placebo or standard care alone. Convalescent plasma does not reduce all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.05; 7 RCTs, 12,646 participants; high-certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on clinical improvement for all participants when assessed by liberation from respiratory support (RR not estimable; 8 RCTs, 12,682 participants; high-certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on the chance of being weaned or liberated from invasive mechanical ventilation for the subgroup of participants requiring invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.93; 2 RCTs, 630 participants; low-certainty evidence). It does not reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.08; 4 RCTs, 11,765 participants; high-certainty evidence). We did not identify any subgroup differences. We did not identify any studies reporting quality of life, and therefore, do not know whether convalescent plasma has any impact on quality of life. One RCT assessed resolution of fatigue on day 7, but we are very uncertain about the effect (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.42; 309 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Safety of convalescent plasma We included results from eight RCTs, and one NRSI, to assess the safety of convalescent plasma. Some of the RCTs reported on safety data only for the convalescent plasma group. We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma increases or reduces the risk of grade 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.41; 4 RCTs, 905 participants; low-certainty evidence), and serious adverse events (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.90; 2 RCTs, 414 participants; low-certainty evidence). A summary of reported events of the NRSI (reporting safety data for 20,000 of 35,322 transfused participants), and four RCTs reporting safety data only for transfused participants (6125 participants) are included in the full text. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and asymptomatic or mild disease We identified one RCT reporting on 160 participants, comparing convalescent plasma to placebo treatment (saline). Effectiveness of convalescent plasma We are very uncertain about the effect of convalescent plasma on all-cause mortality (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.65; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of convalescent plasma on developing severe clinical COVID-19 symptoms (RR not estimable; low-certainty evidence). We identified no study reporting quality of life. Safety of convalescent plasma We do not know whether convalescent plasma is associated with a higher risk of grade 3 or 4 adverse events (very low-certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). This is a living systematic review. We search weekly for new evidence and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We have high certainty in the evidence that convalescent plasma for the treatment of individuals with moderate to severe disease does not reduce mortality and has little to no impact on measures of clinical improvement. We are uncertain about the adverse effects of convalescent plasma. While major efforts to conduct research on COVID-19 are being made, heterogeneous reporting of outcomes is still problematic. There are 100 ongoing studies and 33 studies reporting in a study registry as being completed or terminated. Publication of ongoing studies might resolve some of the uncertainties around hyperimmune immunoglobulin therapy for people with any disease severity, and convalescent plasma therapy for people with asymptomatic or mild disease.","Piechotta, Vanessa; Iannizzi, Claire; Chai, Khai Li; Valk, Sarah J; Kimber, Catherine; Dorando, Elena; Monsef, Ina; Wood, Erica M; Lamikanra, Abigail A; Roberts, David J; McQuilten, Zoe; So-Osman, Cynthia; Estcourt, Lise J; Skoetz, Nicole",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,657
325218,Deep-COVID: Predicting COVID-19 From Chest X-Ray Images Using Deep Transfer Learning,2020-04-20,"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin may reduce mortality in patients with viral respiratory diseases, and are currently being investigated in trials as potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding the benefits and risks is required. OBJECTIVES: To continually assess, as more evidence becomes available, whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in treatment of people with COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database and trial registries to identify completed and ongoing studies on 4 June 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19, irrespective of study design, disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) and studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), and the assessment criteria for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer for non-controlled NRSIs. MAIN RESULTS: This is the first living update of our review. We included 20 studies (1 RCT, 3 controlled NRSIs, 16 non-controlled NRSIs) with 5443 participants, of whom 5211 received convalescent plasma, and identified a further 98 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 50 are randomised. We did not identify any completed studies evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. Overall risk of bias of included studies was high, due to study design, type of participants, and other previous or concurrent treatments. Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 We included results from four controlled studies (1 RCT (stopped early) with 103 participants, of whom 52 received convalescent plasma; and 3 controlled NRSIs with 236 participants, of whom 55 received convalescent plasma) to assess effectiveness of convalescent plasma. Control groups received standard care at time of treatment without convalescent plasma. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge (1 controlled NRSI, 21 participants) We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma has any effect on all-cause mortality at hospital discharge (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.31; very low-certainty evidence). Time to death (1 RCT, 103 participants; 1 controlled NRSI, 195 participants) We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma prolongs time to death (RCT: hazard ratio (HR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.82; controlled NRSI: HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.96; very low-certainty evidence). Improvement of clinical symptoms, assessed by need for respiratory support (1 RCT, 103 participants; 1 controlled NRSI, 195 participants) We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma has any effect on improvement of clinical symptoms at seven days (RCT: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.19), 14 days (RCT: RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.77; controlled NRSI: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.29), and 28 days (RCT: RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.81; very low-certainty evidence). Quality of life No studies reported this outcome. Safety of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 We included results from 1 RCT, 3 controlled NRSIs and 10 non-controlled NRSIs assessing safety of convalescent plasma. Reporting of adverse events and serious adverse events was variable. The controlled studies reported on adverse events and serious adverse events only in participants receiving convalescent plasma. The duration of follow-up varied. Some, but not all, studies included death as a serious adverse event. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (13 studies, 201 participants) The studies did not report the grade of adverse events. Thirteen studies (201 participants) reported on adverse events of possible grade 3 or 4 severity. The majority of these adverse events were allergic or respiratory events. We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of moderate to severe adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events (14 studies, 5201 participants) Fourteen studies (5201 participants) reported on serious adverse events. The majority of participants were from one non-controlled NRSI (5000 participants), which reported only on serious adverse events limited to the first four hours after convalescent plasma transfusion. This study included death as a serious adverse event; they reported 15 deaths, four of which they classified as potentially, probably or definitely related to transfusion. Other serious adverse events reported in all studies were predominantly allergic or respiratory in nature, including anaphylaxis, transfusion-associated dyspnoea, and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma affects the number of serious adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma is beneficial for people admitted to hospital with COVID-19. For safety outcomes we also included non-controlled NRSIs. There was limited information regarding adverse events. Of the controlled studies, none reported on this outcome in the control group. There is only very low-certainty evidence for safety of convalescent plasma for COVID-19. While major efforts to conduct research on COVID-19 are being made, problems with recruiting the anticipated number of participants into these studies are conceivable. The early termination of the first RCT investigating convalescent plasma, and the multitude of studies registered in the past months illustrate this. It is therefore necessary to critically assess the design of these registered studies, and well-designed studies should be prioritised. Other considerations for these studies are the need to report outcomes for all study arms in the same way, and the importance of maintaining comparability in terms of co-interventions administered in all study arms. There are 98 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 50 are RCTs. This is the first living update of the review, and we will continue to update this review periodically. These updates may show different results to those reported here.","Piechotta, Vanessa; Chai, Khai Li; Valk, Sarah J; Doree, Carolyn; Monsef, Ina; Wood, Erica M; Lamikanra, Abigail; Kimber, Catherine; McQuilten, Zoe; So-Osman, Cynthia; Estcourt, Lise J; Skoetz, Nicole",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,657
325483,Wisdom of the Ensemble: Improving Consistency of Deep Learning Models,2020-11-13,"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to determine the effect of a daily dose of ivermectin administered in three consecutive days to non-severe COVID-19 patients with no more than 96 hours of symptoms, on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs at day seven post-treatment initiation. The secondary objectives are: 1. To assess the efficacy of ivermectin to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the nasopharyngeal swab on days 4, 7, 14 and 21 post-treatment initiation 2. To assess the efficacy of ivermectin on the improvement of symptoms 3. To assess the proportion of seroconversions at day 21 4. To assess the safety of ivermectin at the proposed dose 5. To determine the magnitude of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 6. To assess correlation of the presence of intestinal helminths on participants on baseline and day 14 with COVID-19 progression and treatment. TRIAL DESIGN: SAINT PERU is a triple-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with two parallel arms to evaluate the efficacy of ivermectin in negativizing nasopharyngeal PCR in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. PARTICIPANTS: The trial is conducted in two national hospitals in Lima-Peru. The study population is patients with a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal specimen, symptomatic for 96 hours or less, with non-severe COVID-19 disease at baseline, regardless of the presence of risk factors for progression to severity. The study will not include pregnant women or minors (17 years old or younger). Inclusion criteria 1. COVID-19 symptomatology (cough, fever, anosmia, etc.) lasting no more than 96 hours, with a positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. 2. 18 years or older. 3. No use of ivermectin in the month prior to the visit. 4. No known history of ivermectin allergy. 5. Capable to give informed consent. 6. Not current use of CYP 3A4 or P-gp inhibitor drugs such as quinidine, amiodarone, diltiazem, spironolactone, verapamil, clarithromycin, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, indinavir, ritonavir, cobicistat or critical CYP3A4 substrate drugs such as warfarin. Exclusion criteria 1. COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed by the attending physician (oxygen saturation < 95% or lung examination) 2. Positive pregnancy test for women at childbearing age. 3. Positive IgG against SARS-CoV-2 by rapid diagnostic test at screening. Participants will be recruited by the investigators at the emergency services of the study sites. They are expected to remain in the trial for a period of 21 days. Follow-up visits will be conducted by the trial medical staff at the participant's home or at a hospital in case of hospitalization. Follow-up visits will assess clinical and laboratory parameters of the patients. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Ivermectin (300 mcg/kg) or placebo will be administered in one daily dose for three consecutive days. Currently, there is no solid data on the efficacy of ivermectin against the virus in vivo; therefore the use of placebo in the control group is ethically justified. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary Proportion of patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab at day 7 post-treatment. Secondary 1. Mean viral load as determined by PCR cycle threshold (Ct) on days 4, 7, 14, and 21 2. Proportion of patients with fever and cough at days 4, 7, 14, and 21 as well as proportion of patients progressing to severe disease or death during the trial 2. Proportion of patients with a positive rapid diagnostic test at day 21 3. Proportion of drug-related adverse events during the trial 4. Median levels of IgG, IgM, IgA measured by Luminex RANDOMIZATION: Participants will be randomized to receive one dose of 300 mcg/kg ivermectin or placebo daily for three consecutive days. The epidemiologist will generate a list of correlative numbers, in randomized blocks of size 4, with the assignment to the treatment groups (a and b). The randomization list will be kept in an encrypted file accessible only to the trial statistician. This list will be handed directly to the pharmacist. Independently, the principal investigator will randomly assign the intervention (ivermectin) to one of the two groups (a or b) by tossing a coin, and will inform the pharmacist of the result of this process. The pharmacist will prepare and label the treatment vials according to the randomization list prepared by the epidemiologist and the treatment assignment given by the principal investigator. Eligible patients will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio using this randomization list. BLINDING (MASKING): The clinical trial team, the statistician, and the patients will be blinded as to arm allocation. The vials with placebo will be visibly identical to the ones with the active drug. Treatment will be administered by staff not involved in the clinical care or participant's follow up. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): The planned sample size is 186 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients: 93 patients to treatment and 93 to the placebo group. TRIAL STATUS: Current protocol version: 2.0 dated January 15th, 2021. Recruitment started on Aug 29th, 2020. Recruitment is expected to be completed April 30th 2021.

326833,A minimal model of hospital patients’ dynamics in COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Several intensive-care units (ICUs) in Wuhan are nonstandard wards that were repurposed from general wards. Considering the shortage of medical resources and the need to prevent nosocomic infection, the respiratory-treatment strategy in these nonstandard ICUs is different from those in general wards and standard ICUs. High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) plays an important role in nonstandard ICUs and is beneficial to the patients therein. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this study, we analyzed four cases of HFNC-treated patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a makeshift ICU and summarized our experience. DIAGNOSES: Four patients diagnosed with COVID-19 according to World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance were admitted to the makeshift ICU. INTERVENTIONS: All patients had oxygen treatment with HFNC, as well as regular treatment of antivirals and traditional Chinese medicine. OUTCOMES: Two patients survived after treatment, while the other two died from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and heart failure, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 often have poor prognoses after mechanical ventilation, exhibiting corresponding complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and deep-vein thrombosis, which significantly prolongs length of stay in the ICU. HFNC could prevent intubation in some patients, thereby avoiding the above complications; however, this needs confirmation in further clinical studies. This treatment reduced difficulty and workloads for healthcare professionals, had good tolerability for patients, might not significantly increase the risk of infection for healthcare professionals, and do not require additional preventive measures against nosocomic infection. HFNC treatment has its advantages in providing oxygen therapy in COVID-19, but healthcare professionals should still pay close attention to changes in patients' oxygenation rates and respiratory frequency.","Lu, Xiao; Xu, Shanxiang",Medicine (Baltimore),,657

331188,"Analysis and forecast of COVID-19 spreading in China, Italy and France",2020,"In the area of Internet of Things (IoT) voice assistants have become an important interface to operate smart speakers, smartphones, and even automobiles. To save power and protect user privacy, voice assistants send commands to the cloud only if a small set of pre-registered wake-up words are detected. However, voice assistants are shown to be vulnerable to the FakeWake phenomena, whereby they are inadvertently triggered by innocent-sounding fuzzy words. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the FakeWake phenomena from three aspects. To start with, we design the first fuzzy word generator to automatically and efficiently produce fuzzy words instead of searching through a swarm of audio materials. We manage to generate 965 fuzzy words covering 8 most popular English and Chinese smart speakers. To explain the causes underlying the FakeWake phenomena, we construct an interpretable tree-based decision model, which reveals phonetic features that contribute to false acceptance of fuzzy words by wake-up word detectors. Finally, we propose remedies to mitigate the effect of FakeWake. The results show that the strengthened models are not only resilient to fuzzy words but also achieve better overall performance on original training datasets.","Chen, Yanjiao; Bai, Yijie; Mitev, Richard; Wang, Kaibo; Sadeghi, Ahmad-Reza; Xu, Wenyuan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09958v1.pdf,657

However, standardized analysis tools for IVPG quantification are missing. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility, the test-retest observer reproducibility, and the inter-system variability of a semi-automated IVPG quantification algorithm. The study included forty healthy volunteers (50% were men). All volunteers were examined using two ultrasound systems, the Philips Epiq 7 and the General Electric Vivid 6. Left ventricular diastolic (DIVPG) and systolic (SIVPG) intraventricular pressure gradients were measured from the spatiotemporal distribution of intraventricular propagation flow velocities using color Doppler M-mode in standard apical views. There was good feasibility for both systolic and diastolic IVPG measurements (82.5% and 85%, respectively). Intra and inter-observer test-retest variability measured with the intraclass correlation coefficient were 0.98 and 0.93 for DIVPG respectively, and 0.95 and 0.89 for SIVPG respectively. The inter-system concordance was weak to moderate with Lin's concordance correlation coefficient of 0.59 for DIVPG and 0.25 for SIVPG. In conclusion, it is feasible and reproducible to assess systolic and diastolic IVPG using color Doppler M-mode in healthy volunteers. However, the inter-system variability in IVPG analysis needs to be taken into account, especially when using displayed data.","Hodzic, Amir; Bonnefous, Odile; Langet, Hélène; Hamiche, Walid; Chaufourier, Laure; Tournoux, Francois; Milliez, Paul; Normand, Hervé; Saloux, Eric",Sci Rep,,657

334697,Optimum Location of Field Hospitals for COVID-19: A Nonlinear Binary Metaheuristic Algorithm,2021,"CONTEXT: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to exert an immense burden on global health services. Moreover, up to 63% of patients experience persistent symptoms, including fatigue, after acute illness. Endocrine systems are vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19 as many glands express the ACE2 receptor, used by the SARS-CoV-2 virion for cellular access. However, the effects of COVID-19 on adrenal and thyroid gland function after acute COVID-19 remain unknown. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to evaluate adrenal and thyroid gland function in COVID-19 survivors. DESIGN: A prospective, observational study was undertaken. SETTING: Clinical Research Facility, Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy patients &#8805; 18 years at least 3 months after diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. INTERVENTION: Participants attended a research study visit (08:00-09:30), during which a short Synacthen test (250 µg IV bolus), and thyroid function assessments were performed. RESULTS: All patients had a peak cortisol &#8805;450 nmol/l after Synacthen, consistent with adequate adrenal reserve. Basal and peak serum cortisol did not differ according to disease severity or history of dexamethasone treatment during COVID-19. There was no difference in baseline or peak cortisol after Synacthen or in thyroid function tests, or thyroid status, in patients with fatigue (n=44) compared to those without (n=26). CONCLUSIONS: Adrenal and thyroid function &#8805;3 months after presentation with COVID-19 was preserved. Whilst a significant proportion of patients experienced persistent fatigue, their symptoms were not accounted for by alterations in adrenal or thyroid function. These findings have important implications for the clinical care of patients after COVID-19.","Clarke, Sophie A; Phylactou, Maria; Patel, Bijal; Mills, Edouard G; Muzi, Beatrice; Izzi-Engbeaya, Chioma; Choudhury, Sirazum; Khoo, Bernard; Meeran, Karim; Comninos, Alexander N; Abbara, Ali; Tan, Tricia; Dhillo, Waljit S",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,,657
334826,Advance Warning Methodologies for COVID-19 using Chest X-Ray Images,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought countries' health services into sharp focus. It was drawn to our group's attention that healthcare workers (HCWs) had a lower mortality rate against higher COVID-19 incidence compared to the general population in Turkey. Since risk of exposure to tuberculosis bacillus among healthcare workers are higher than the population, we aimed to investigate if there is a relationship between BCG and Mycobacterium tuberculosis exposure history with COVID-19 severity in infected HCWs. This study was conducted with 465 infected HCWs from thirty-three hospitals to assess the relationship between COVID-19 severity (according to their hospitalization status and the presence of radiological pneumonia) and BCG and Mycobacterium tuberculosis exposure history. HCWs who required hospital admission had significantly higher rates of chronic diseases, radiological pneumonia, and longer working hours in the clinics. Higher rates of history of contact and care to tuberculosis patients, history of tuberculosis, and BCG vaccine were observed in hospitalized HCWs. HCWs who had radiological pneumonia had a significantly increased ratio of history of care to tuberculosis patients and a higher family history of tuberculosis. The findings from our study suggest that the lower mortality rate despite the more severe disease course seen in infected HCWs might be due to frequent exposure to tuberculosis bacillus and the mortality-reducing effects of the BCG vaccine.","Torun, Serife; Ozkaya, Sevket; Sen, Nazan; Kanat, Fikret; Karaman, Irem; Yosunkaya, Sebnem; Sengoren Dikis, Ozlem; Asan, Ali; Aydogan Eroglu, Selma; Semih Atal, Sefa; Ayten, Omer; Aksel, Nimet; Ermis, Hilal; Özçelik, Neslihan; Demirelli, Meryem; Kara, Iskender; Sümer, Sua; Marakoglu, Kamile; Üzer, Fatih; Uyar, Yasin; Çiçek, Tuba; E Ünsal, Zuhal; Vatansev, Husamettin; Botan Yildirim, Berna; Kuruoglu, Tuba; Atilla, Aynur; Ersoy, Yasemin; Kandemir, Bahar; Durduran, Yasemin; Goksin Cihan, Fatma; Demirbas, Nur; Yildirim, Fatma; Tatar, Dursun; Akcay, M Sule",Pathog Glob Health,,657

Methods A retrospective observational study at an academic tertiary care center in Northern New Jersey. Study population included 900 adult patients admitted to the hospital with a confirmed COVID-19 infection between March and April 2020. Results Overall in-hospital mortality over 75-day period is 40.7%(n=367) with ICU group showing 77.1%(n=237) mortality and floor group showing 21.9%(n=130). 257/900(28.5%) patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. 145(16.1%) patients managed on BiPAP/AVAPS, 323(35.9%) patients were on High Flow Nasal Cannula. Cardiac injury (elevated troponin &gt;0.05 ng/ml) was noted to be of highest incidence 51.2%(n=461) followed by renal failure 35.1%(n=316). Incidence of end organ injury and shock were significantly higher in ICU group and they had higher levels of inflammatory markers as compared to floor groups. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed age &gt;65, elevated IL6, acute renal injury, cardiac injury, and invasive mechanical ventilation as risk factors associated with mortality. Conclusion Cardiac injury is more common among hospitalized COVID 19 patients and is associated with increased mortality. Different mechanisms have been postulated for the reasons for cardiac injury including hypercoagulable and pro-inflammatory state and demand ischemia as well.

METHODS: We describe the clinical characteristics, disease presentation, treatments and outcomes of all pediatric cases with COVID-19 admitted to the reference hospitals in Navarra, Spain during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak (February-May 2020). RESULTS: We found a low number of hospitalized cases in infants and children compared to adults with a hospitalization ratio of 1:180. Most of these hospitalized cases did not suffer from severe disease. Over 80% of infections reported household contacts, and the mother was the known-contact in 83% of these cases. 72% of hospitalized cases were previously healthy children. We describe how symptoms in pediatric cases are nonspecific and how COVID-19 can be presented with a wide range and variety of symptoms. Respiratory symptoms are not always present, and severe neurological and cardiac features can occur in previously healthy children. CONCLUSION: Epidemiological description and case reports will be key to a better recognition and to adequate treatment of pediatric patients with COVID-19.","Moreno-Galarraga, Laura; Urretavizcaya-Martínez, María; Alegría Echauri, Josune; García Howard, Marcos; Ruperez García, Eva; Aguilera-Albesa, Sergio; Alzina de Aguilar, Valentín; Herranz Aguirre, Mercedes",World J Pediatr,,657
340927,Diagnosis and detection of infected tissue of COVID-19 patients based on lung x-ray image using convolutional neural network approaches,2020,"This work proposes and analyzes the use of keystroke biometrics for content de-anonymization. Fake news have become a powerful tool to manipulate public opinion, especially during major events. In particular, the massive spread of fake news during the COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments and companies to fight against missinformation. In this context, the ability to link multiple accounts or profiles that spread such malicious content on the Internet while hiding in anonymity would enable proactive identification and blacklisting. Behavioral biometrics can be powerful tools in this fight. In this work, we have analyzed how the latest advances in keystroke biometric recognition can help to link behavioral typing patterns in experiments involving 100,000 users and more than 1 million typed sequences. Our proposed system is based on Recurrent Neural Networks adapted to the context of content de-anonymization. Assuming the challenge to link the typed content of a target user in a pool of candidate profiles, our results show that keystroke recognition can be used to reduce the list of candidate profiles by more than 90%. In addition, when keystroke is combined with auxiliary data (such as location), our system achieves a Rank-1 identification performance equal to 52.6% and 10.9% for a background candidate list composed of 1K and 100K profiles, respectively.","Morales, Aythami; Acien, Alejandro; Fierrez, Julian; Monaco, John V.; Tolosana, Ruben; Vera-Rodriguez, Ruben; Ortega-Garcia, Javier",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07688v2.pdf,657

Currently, there are no known biomarkers, the determination of which before the onset of the disease would allow assessing the likelihood of its severe course. The purpose of this literature review was to analyze possible genetic factors characterizing the immune response to the new coronavirus infection that could be associated with the expression of angiotension-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and related proteins as predictors of severe Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We analyzed original articles published in Medline, PubMed and Scopus databases from December 2019 to November 2020. For searching articles, we used the following keywords: New coronavirus infection, Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19, severe course, complications, thrombosis, cytokine storm, ACE-2, biomarkers. In total, 3714 publications were selected using the keywords, of which 8 were in congruence with all the criteria. The literature analysis of the association of immunogenic characteristics and the expression of ACE-2 and related proteins with the development of severe COVID-19 revealed following genetic factors: HLA-B*46:01 genotype, CXCR6 gene hypoexpression, CCR9 gene expression, TLR7, rs150892504 mutations in the ERAP2 gene, overexpression of wild-type ACE-2, TMPRSS2 and its different polymorphisms. Genes, associated with the severe course, are more common among men. According to the analysis data, it can be assumed that there are population differences.

Application to COVID-19 diagnosis in chest X-ray images,2020-11-27,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic public health and social protective measures imposed globally resulted in partial or full closure of key services and supports for services and supports for people with a disability, chronic illness or age-related dependency. This caused huge disruption to care provision and family carers were relied upon to assume this care at home. Many family carers, including those in employment, found themselves navigating additional care responsibilities without 'usual levels' of support from family, friends, work, school, day care services, homecare and community services. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on family carers, their employment and care-giving responsibilities, through the lens of the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory (Hobfoll, 1989). Adopting a qualitative research approach, 16 family carers (14 females, 2 males) who were in employment prior to the onset of or during the pandemic, participated in an in-depth, semi-structured telephone or online video interview between June and September 2020. Interviews lasted between 45 and 100 min, were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis of the interview data identified four main themes: colliding worlds; navigating unchartered waters alone; opportunity despite adversity and the relentless unknowing. Findings indicate that the onset of the pandemic resulted in the sudden loss of valued resources, which disrupted routines and caused care and work life domains to become intrinsically intertwined. Consistent with the main principles of the COR theory, adapting and transitioning to different ways of working and caring with depleted resources and supports, generated considerable stress for family carers and impacted their well-being. The implications for employers, healthcare providers, policy makers and other key stakeholders are considered, to enable family carers to successfully reconcile work with care and protect their well-being, as the pandemic continues to unfold and in the event of future societal crises.","Lafferty, Attracta; Phillips, Dominique; Dowling-Hertherington, Linda; Fahy, Majella; Moloney, Breda; Duffy, Clare; Paul, Gillian; Fealy, Gerard; Kroll, Thilo",Heal. soc. care community,,657

Appraisal instruments for QoL assessment, such as rankings and guides, should therefore include these aspects. The aim of this research was to verify the significance of water and climate-related aspects in assessment tools. A comparative analysis of 24 selected QoL assessment tools shows to what extent these aspects are included in the domains, criteria, and indicators proposed in the instruments. The method of verification is a comparison of the position of winning cities in QoL rankings and city resilience rankings. The results show that water and climate-related aspects are still underestimated in the QoL rankings and guides, and only a few cities with the highest quality of life ranked highly in sustainability and climate resiliency ratings.

350980,An Intelligent and Automated Approach for Smart Minimarkets,2020,"Sub-Saharan Africa has generally experienced few cases and deaths of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition to other potential explanations for the few cases and deaths of COVID-19 such as the population socio-demographics, early lockdown measures and the possibility of under reporting, we hypothesize in this mini review that individuals with a recent history of malaria infection may be protected against infection or severe form of COVID-19. Given that both the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) merozoites bind to the cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) immunoglobulin, we hypothesize that the immunological memory against P. falciparum merozoites primes SARS-CoV-2 infected cells for early phagocytosis, hence protecting individuals with a recent P. falciparum infection against COVID-19 infection or severity. This mini review therefore discusses the potential biological link between P. falciparum infection and COVID-19 infection or severity and further highlights the importance of CD147 immunoglobulin as an entry point for both SARS-CoV-2 and P. falciparum into host cells.","Kalungi, Allan; Kinyanda, Eugene; Akena, Dickens Howard; Kaleebu, Pontiano; Bisangwa, Innocent M",Front Immunol,,657
351160,Text Classification of Manifestos and COVID-19 Press Briefings using BERT and Convolutional Neural Networks,2020-10-20,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread widely, causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and significant mortality. However, data on viral loads and antibody kinetics in immunocompromised populations are lacking. We aimed to determine nasopharyngeal and plasma viral loads via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and SARS-CoV-2 serology via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and study their association with severe forms of COVID-19 and death in kidney transplant recipients. In this study, we examined hospitalized kidney transplant recipients with nonsevere (n = 21) and severe (n = 19) COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal and plasma viral load and serological response were evaluated based on outcomes and disease severity. Ten recipients (25%) displayed persistent viral shedding 30 days after symptom onset. The SARS-CoV-2 viral load of the upper respiratory tract was not associated with severe COVID-19, whereas the plasma viral load was associated with COVID-19 severity (P = .010) and mortality (P = .010). All patients harbored antibodies during the second week after symptom onset that persisted for 2 months. We conclude that plasma viral load is associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, whereas nasopharyngeal viral load is not. SARS-CoV-2 shedding is prolonged in kidney transplant recipients and the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 does not show significant impairment in this series of transplant recipients.","Benotmane, Ilies; Gautier-Vargas, Gabriela; Wendling, Marie-Josée; Perrin, Peggy; Velay, Aurélie; Bassand, Xavier; Bedo, Dimitri; Baldacini, Clément; Sagnard, Mylène; Bozman, Dogan-Firat; Della-Chiesa, Margaux; Solis, Morgane; Gallais, Floriane; Cognard, Noëlle; Olagne, Jérôme; Delagrèverie, Héloïse; Gontard, Louise; Panaget, Baptiste; Marx, David; Heibel, Françoise; Braun-Parvez, Laura; Moulin, Bruno; Caillard, Sophie; Fafi-Kremer, Samira",Am. j. transplant,,657

However, vaccines and traditional drug discovery for COVID-19 cost too much in terms of time, manpower, and money. Drug repurposing becomes one of the promising treatment strategies amid the COVID-19 crisis. At present, there are no publicly existing databases for experimentally supported human drug-virus interactions, and most existing drug repurposing methods require the rich information, which is not always available, especially for a new virus. In this study, on the one hand, we put size-able efforts to collect drug-virus interaction entries from literature and build the Human Drug Virus Database (HDVD). On the other hand, we propose a new approach, called SCPMF (similarity constrained probabilistic matrix factorization), to identify new drug-virus interactions for drug repurposing. SCPMF is implemented on an adjacency matrix of a heterogeneous drug-virus network, which integrates the known drug-virus interactions, drug chemical structures, and virus genomic sequences. SCPMF projects the drug-virus interactions matrix into two latent feature matrices for the drugs and viruses, which reconstruct the drug-virus interactions matrix when multiplied together, and then introduces the weighted similarity interaction matrix as constraints for drugs and viruses. Benchmarking comparisons on two different datasets demonstrate that SCPMF has reliable prediction performance and outperforms several recent approaches. Moreover, SCPMF-predicted drug candidates of COVID-19 also confirm the accuracy and reliability of SCPMF.","Meng, Yajie; Jin, Min; Tang, Xianfang; Xu, Junlin",Appl Soft Comput,,657
355384,High-precision thermography based on JMAP inference for human face temperature,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The outbreak of COVID-19 that commenced in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has caused extensive public health concerns and posed substantial challenges to health professionals, especially for those in the center of the epidemic. The current study aimed to assess the prevalence, related factors, and mechanism of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) among health professionals in Wuhan during this critical period. METHODS: The study used a cross-sectional design. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to the frontline health professionals in Wuhan hospitals from January 28 to February 1, 2020. Mental health related measurements included ASD, depression, anxiety, conflict experiences, hostility, and psychosomatic symptoms. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the factors associated with ASD among health professionals. RESULTS: A total of 332 frontline health professionals were included in the analysis (mean age 32.21±8.77 years; 78.0% women). ASD was a prominent mental health problem in the health professionals surveyed, with a prevalence of 38.3%. Anxiety (24.7%) and depression (20.2%) were also common. SEM analyses revealed that emotional distress (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms) fully mediated the association between conflicts with ASD (the standardized indirect coefficient ß=0.47, p=0.016). The most common reported symptom was chest pain (51.2%). ASD was significantly associated with psychosomatic symptoms. The majority (67.8%) reported being easily annoyed or irritated and ASD was associated with hostility. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, a substantial number of health professionals in Wuhan suffered from ASD. Furthermore, ASD was found to be associated with psychosomatic symptoms as well as the hostility. The poor mental health of health professionals has detrimental impacts both on the wellbeing of staff in healthcare systems and may adversely affect the quality of patient care. We call for interventions that aim to relieve the psychological and occupational stress. Considering most of our participants were young, female frontline health professionals, the results may not be generalized to more heterogenous samples.","Wang, YuanYuan; Duan, Zhizhou; Peng, Ke; Li, Dan; Ou, Jianjun; Wilson, Amanda; Wang, Nan; Si, Lei; Chen, Runsen",Psychosom. med,,657

Additional infection control, the possibility of quarantine of staff and minimising contact among staff have significant impact on the work of doctors in the emergency department. Infection of a single healthcare worker may require quarantine of close contacts at work. This may thus affect a potentially large number of staff. As such, we developed an Outbreak Response Roster. This Outbreak Response Roster had fixed teams of doctors working in rotation, each team that staff the emergency department in turn. Members within teams remained constant and were near equally balanced in terms of manpower and seniority of doctors. Each team worked fixed 12 hours shifts with as no overlapping of staff or staggering of shifts. Handovers between shifts were kept as brief as possible. All these were measures to limit interactions among healthcare workers. With the implementation of the roster, measures were also taken to bolster the psychological wellness of healthcare workers. With face-to-face contact limited, we also had to maintain clear, open channels for communication through technology and continue educating residents through innovative means.","Chua, Wei Lin Tallie; Quah, Li Juan Joy; Shen, Yuzeng; Zakaria, Diana; Wan, Paul Weng; Tan, Kenneth; Wong, Evelyn",Emerg Med J,,657

361755,The process implementation of micro manufactured SLA printed nasopharyngeal swabs,2021,"The concept of the ‘pre-criminal space’ has seen increasing uncritical use in countering terrorism policy since 9/11. It is understood by critical scholars primarily as a new legal temporality that brings forward the ‘threshold of criminal responsibility’, thus allowing for pre-emptive, suspicion-based criminalisation. This has allowed for the validation of measures such as arbitrary arrest and detention, bogus trial and restrictions on liberty, and is evidenced as being applied in an Islamophobic and racialised manner to entire communities. Furthermore, in our contemporary moment of Covid-19 where the emergency tools used to regulate hygiene and infection intersect with those used in countering terrorism work, critics are increasingly concerned about the expansion and normalisation of the pre-criminal space and its use in pathologising and medicalised ways. Using archival research, this article adapts the contemporary concept of the ‘pre-criminal’ to a historical and medico-legal context. In doing so it traces how the history of infectious diseases–in particular VD–has shaped the space through slippages between hegemonic understandings of morality, hygiene, vagrancy and extremism. I show how the ‘vagrant’ nature of disease marked racialised, gendered and classed subjects as potentially infectious and immoral. Looking particularly at the regulation of sex workers in British-occupied Egypt, I conceptualise the power struggles between actors including the British administration, British abolitionist feminists and the Egyptian government as a securitisation network which infiltrated the lives of Egyptians and marked them as suspicious. I further show how the encroachment upon everyday lives was made even more possible through the implementation of martial law. In this way, I suggest that contemporary British forms of pre-criminality and risk can be understood as a latent form of coloniality present in law-making practices. © 2021 Australian Feminist Law Journal Inc.","Finden, A.",Australian Feminist Law Journal,,657

Antimalarial peroxides have reported antiviral and anticancer activities. Here, we evaluated the in vitro activities of artesunate (AS) and two ozonides (OZ418 and OZ277) against human &#945;-coronavirus NL63 and ß-coronaviruses OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 in several cell lines. OZ418 had the best selectivity index (SI) in NL63-infected Vero cells and MK2 cells. The overall SI of the tested compounds was cell-type dependent. In OC43-infected human foreskin fibroblasts, AS had the best cell-associated SI, &#8805;17 µM, while the SI of OZ418 and OZ277 was &#8805;12 µM and &#8805;7 µM, respectively. AS did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in either Vero or Calu-3 cells. A comparison of OZ418 and OZ277 activity in SARS-CoV2-infected Calu-3 cells revealed similar EC50 (5.3 µM and 11.6 µM, respectively), higher than the EC50 of remdesivir (1.0 ± 0.1 µM), but the SI of OZ418 was higher than OZ277. A third ozonide, OZ439, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 efficiently in Vero cells, but compared to OZ418 in Calu-3 cells, it showed higher toxicity. Improved inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 was observed when OZ418 was used together with remdesivir. Although the EC50 of ozonides might be clinically achieved in plasma after intravenous administration, sustained virus suppression in tissues will require further considerations, including drug combination. Our work supports the potential repurposing of ozonides and calls for future in vivo models.","Ghosh, Ayan Kumar; Miller, Halli; Knox, Konstance; Kundu, Madhuchhanda; Henrickson, Kelly J; Arav-Boger, Ravit",ACS Infect Dis,,657

DESIGN: Qualitative semi-structured interview study. SETTING: Participants' homes. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults living in Uganda (aged 60+). MEASUREMENTS: Older adults in Uganda were interviewed over the phone and asked about their lives before and since COVID-19, and how public health restrictions have affected their lives. Semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and translated into English. Transcripts were thematically analyzed and themes generated in discussion. RESULTS: In total, 30 older adults participated in the study. Five themes were identified: (1) economic impacts; (2) lack of access to basic necessities; (3) impact on healthcare utilization; (4) social impacts and (5) violent reinforcement of public health restrictions. COVID-19 public health restrictions had severe impacts on their lives, with many people having not enough food to eat due to lack of income, and being unable to pay their grandchildren's school fees. Steep rises in public transport fares and an overall avoidance of transport also resulted in a lack of access to healthcare services and difficulty in getting food. Restrictions were violently reinforced by security guards. CONCLUSIONS: Public health restrictions have a severe impact not only on older adults but also on the whole family in Uganda.

368036,Mask Wearing Detection Method Based on the Skin Color and Eyes Detection,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which has reached pandemic levels resulting in significant morbidity and mortality affecting every inhabited continent. The large number of patients requiring intensive care threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems globally. Likewise, there is a compelling need for a COVID-19 disease severity test to prioritize care and resources for patients at elevated risk of mortality. Here, an integrated point-of-care COVID-19 Severity Score and clinical decision support system is presented using biomarker measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), N-terminus pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), myoglobin (MYO), D-dimer, procalcitonin (PCT), creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). The COVID-19 Severity Score combines multiplex biomarker measurements and risk factors in a statistical learning algorithm to predict mortality. The COVID-19 Severity Score was trained and evaluated using data from 160 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from Wuhan, China. Our analysis finds that COVID-19 Severity Scores were significantly higher for the group that died versus the group that was discharged with median (interquartile range) scores of 59 (40-83) and 9 (6-17), respectively, and area under the curve of 0.94 (95% CI 0.89-0.99). Although this analysis represents patients with cardiac comorbidities (hypertension), the inclusion of biomarkers from other pathophysiologies implicated in COVID-19 (e.g., D-dimer for thrombotic events, CRP for infection or inflammation, and PCT for bacterial co-infection and sepsis) may improve future predictions for a more general population. These promising initial models pave the way for a point-of-care COVID-19 Severity Score system to impact patient care after further validation with externally collected clinical data. Clinical decision support tools for COVID-19 have strong potential to empower healthcare providers to save lives by prioritizing critical care in patients at high risk for adverse outcomes.","McRae, Michael P; Simmons, Glennon W; Christodoulides, Nicolaos J; Lu, Zhibing; Kang, Stella K; Fenyo, David; Alcorn, Timothy; Dapkins, Isaac P; Sharif, Iman; Vurmaz, Deniz; Modak, Sayli S; Srinivasan, Kritika; Warhadpande, Shruti; Shrivastav, Ravi; McDevitt, John T",Lab Chip,,657

369995,Modeling the dynamic of COVID-19 with different types of transmissions,2021,"Infectious diseases are a threat for human health with tremendous impact on our society at large. The recent COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, is the latest example of a highly infectious disease ravaging the world, since late 2019. It is therefore imperative to develop efficient mathematical models, able to substantially curb the damages of a pandemic by unveiling disease spreading dynamics and symmetries. This will help inform (non)-pharmaceutical prevention strategies. For the reasons above we wrote this report that goes at the heart of mathematical modelling of infectious disease diffusion by simultaneously investigating the underlying microscopic dynamics in terms of percolation models, effective description via compartmental models and the employment of temporal symmetries naturally encoded in the mathematical language of critical phenomena. Our report reviews these approaches and determines their common denominators, relevant for theoretical epidemiology and its link to important concepts in theoretical physics. We show that the different frameworks exhibit common features such as criticality and self-similarity under time rescaling. These features are naturally encoded within the unifying field theoretical approach. The latter leads to an efficient description of the time evolution of the disease via a framework in which (near) time-dilation invariance is explicitly realised. As important test of the relevance of symmetries we show how to mathematically account for observed phenomena such as multi-wave dynamics. The models presented here are of immediate relevance for different realms of scientific enquiry from medical applications to the understanding of human behaviour. Our review offers novel perspectives on how to model, capture, organise and understand epidemiological data and disease dynamics for modelling real-world phenomena.","Cacciapaglia, Giacomo; Cot, Corentin; Morte, Michele Della; Hohenegger, Stefan; Sannino, Francesco; Vatani, Shahram",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11399v2.pdf,657

In this study, 24 goat diarrheic fecal samples were collected from 3 farms in Sichuan province, China, and 87.5% (21/24) samples were detected as CKoV positive by RT-PCR. Meanwhile, full-length VP0, VP3, and VP1 genes were simultaneously cloned from 17 clinical samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all CKoV strains were most closely related to porcine kobuvirus based on amino acid (aa) sequences of VP0 and VP3 proteins, but CKoV strains were closely related to with Aichivirus B strains (ferret, bovine, and sheep kobuvirus) based on aa sequences of the VP1 protein. Interestingly, compared with known CKoV strains in the GenBank database, Chinese CKoV strains have unique amino acid changes in VP0 and VP1 proteins. Moreover, the first Chinese CKoV nearly complete genome was successfully obtained from a diarrheic fecal sample, named SWUN/F11/2019. Compared with the two known CKoV strains, five aa mutations (S60A, L252I, V267T, I, V 306â¯L, V331I) were found in the VP0 gene and 7 aa mutations (S57N, G, T243A, V244I, T, A248V, L, S251A, R252H, and M255L) were found in VP1 in the SWUN/F11/2019 genome. This was the first report of the detection and molecular characteristics of CKoV from goats in China, which could be helpful for improving the understanding of the prevalence and genetic evolution of CKoV.","Abi, Keha-Mo; Zhang, Qi; Jing, Zhi Zhong; Tang, Cheng",Infect Genet Evol,,657

376150,A hybrid approach for cyber security: Improved intrusion detection system using ann-svm,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly-discovered coronavirus and responsible for the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 infected millions of people in the world and immediately became a pandemic in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta-coronavirus genus of the large family of Coronaviridae. It is now known that its surface spike glycoprotein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which is expressed on the lung epithelial cells, mediates the fusion of the cellular and viral membranes, and facilitates the entry of viral genome to the host cell. Therefore, blocking the virus-cell interaction could be a potential target for the prevention of viral infection. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 is a protein-protein interaction, and so, analyzing the structure of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and its underlying mechanism to bind the host cell receptor would be useful for the management and treatment of COVID-19. In this study, we performed comparative in silico studies to deeply understand the structural and functional details of the interaction between the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and its cognate cellular receptor ACE2. According to our results, the affinity of the ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 was higher than SARS-CoV. According to the free energy decomposition of the spike glycoprotein-ACE2 complex, we found critical points in three areas which are responsible for the increased binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV. These mutations occurred at the receptor-binding domain of the spike glycoprotein that play an essential role in the increasing the affinity of coronavirus to ACE2. For instance, mutations Pro462Ala and Leu472Phe resulted in the altered binding energy from - 2 kcal mol-1 in SARS-COV to - 6 kcal mol-1 in SARS-COV-2. The results demonstrated that some mutations in the receptor-binding motif could be considered as a hot-point for designing potential drugs to inhibit the interaction between the spike glycoprotein and ACE2.","Jafary, Farzaneh; Jafari, Sepideh; Ganjalikhany, Mohamad Reza",Sci Rep,,657

382426,Item-Based Collaborative Filtering and Association Rules for a Baseline Recommender in E-Commerce,2020,"Since the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, a great effort has been made to understand this serious disease. Thousands of studies are being devoted to understanding its epidemiology, its molecular characteristics, its mechanisms, and the clinical evolution of this viral infection. However, little has been published on its pathogenesis and the host response mechanisms in the progress of the disease. Therefore, we propose a hypothesis based on strong scientific documentation, associating oxidative stress with changes found in patients with COVID-19, such as its participation in the amplification and perpetuation of the cytokine storm, coagulopathy, and cell hypoxia. Finally, we suggest a therapeutic strategy to reduce oxidative stress using antioxidants, NF-&#954;B inhibitors, Nrf2 activators, and iron complexing agents.

382933,The Practicality of Deep Learning Algorithms in COVID-19 Detection: Application to Chest X-ray Images,2021,"Tumour spheroids are widely used as an in vitro assay for characterising the dynamics and response to treatment of different cancer cell lines. Their popularity is largely due to the reproducible manner in which spheroids grow: the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen from the surrounding culture medium, and their consumption by tumour cells, causes proliferation to be localised at the spheroid boundary. As the spheroid grows, cells at the spheroid centre may become hypoxic and die, forming a necrotic core. The pressure created by the localisation of tumour cell proliferation and death generates an cellular flow of tumour cells from the spheroid rim towards its core. Experiments by Dorie et al. showed that this flow causes inert microspheres to infiltrate into tumour spheroids via advection from the spheroid surface, by adding microbeads to the surface of tumour spheroids and observing the distribution over time. We use an off-lattice hybrid agent-based model to re-assess these experiments and establish the extent to which the spatio-temporal data generated by microspheres can be used to infer kinetic parameters associated with the tumour spheroids that they infiltrate. Variation in these parameters, such as the rate of tumour cell proliferation or sensitivity to hypoxia, can produce spheroids with similar bulk growth dynamics but differing internal compositions (the proportion of the tumour which is proliferating, hypoxic/quiescent and necrotic/nutrient-deficient). We use this model to show that the types of experiment conducted by Dorie et al. could be used to infer spheroid composition and parameters associated with tumour cell lines such as their sensitivity to hypoxia or average rate of proliferation, and note that these observations cannot be conducted within previous continuum models of microbead infiltration into tumour spheroids as they rely on resolving the trajectories of individual microbeads.","Bull, Joshua A; Mech, Franziska; Quaiser, Tom; Waters, Sarah L; Byrne, Helen M",PLoS Comput Biol,,657

To effectively control the spread of this disease, it is essential that it be diagnosed at an early stage so that patients can be reliably quarantined such that disease spread will be slowed. At present, the diagnosis of this infectious form of coronavirus pneumonia is largely dependent upon a combination of laboratory testing and imaging analyses of variable diagnostic efficacy. In the present report, we reviewed prior literature pertaining to the diagnosis of different forms of pneumonia caused by coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome, and SARS-CoV-2) and assessed two different potential diagnostic approaches. We ultimately found that computed tomography was associated with a higher rate of diagnostic accuracy than was a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based approach (P = .0041), and chest radiography (P = .0100). Even so, it is important that clinicians utilize a combination of laboratory and radiological testing where possible to ensure that this virus is reliably and quickly detected such that it may be treated and patients may be isolated in a timely fashion, thereby effectively curbing the further progression of this pandemic.","Zheng, Zhong; Yao, Zhixian; Wu, Ke; Zheng, Junhua",J. med. virol,,657

First, we draw upon feminist and intersectional literatures on gendered inequalities and social structures, which provide the often forgotten or overlooked context for women’s experiences in housing. This includes the broader insight that too frequently, women have not been involved in shaping the policy and planning climate around housing, even as they disproportionately are affected by them. Second, we describe women’s housing-related precarity and some of its implications, grounding this research in a political economic critique of the way that housing and resources are allocated and the neoliberal climate that values profit over people and that has induced instability for many women in so many communities. We conclude by offering examples of organizations and initiatives that work to address the disparities identified herein.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective study of patients diagnosed with Covid-19 pneumonia. Patients were followed until home discharge or death. PSI, CURB-65, SMART-COP and MuLBSTA severity scores were assessed on admission. Risk scores were related to mortality and ICU admission. RESULTS: About 249 patients, 143 males (57.4%) were included. The mean age was 65.6 + 16.1 years. Factors associates with mortality in the multivariate analysis were age > 80 years (OR: 13.9; 95% CI 3.8-51.1) (P = .000), lymphocytes < 800 (OR: 2.9; CI 95% 1.1-7-9) (P = .040), confusion (OR: 6.3; 95% CI 1.6-24.7) (P = .008) and NT-proBNP > 500 pg/mL (OR: 10.1; 95% CI 1.1-63.1) (P = .039). In predicting mortality, the PSI score: AUC 0.874 (95% CI 0.808-0.939) and the CURB-65 score: AUC 0.852 (95% CI 0.794-0.909) were the ones that obtained the best results. In the need for ICU admission, the SMART-COP score: AUC 0.749 (95% CI 0.695-0.820) and the MuLBSTA score: AUC 0.777 (95% CI 0.713-0.840) were the ones that obtained better results, with significant differences with PSI and CURB-65. The scores with the lowest value for ICU admission prediction were PSI with AUC of 0.620 (95% CI 0.549-0.690) and CURB-65 with AUC of 0.604 (95% CI 0.528-0.680). CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis scores routinely used for CAP (PSI and CURB-65) were good predictors for mortality in patients with Covid-19 CAP but not for need of hospitalisation or ICU admission.

389844,A new approach to q-linear Diophantine fuzzy emergency decision support system for COVID19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Preliminary evidence suggests that children are just as likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 as adults but are less prone to developing severe clinical conditions. However, there are pediatric inflammatory conditions that have also been encountered. The aim of this report is to determine whether there is a relationship between COVID-19 and severe infections in the ear, nose, throat, and deep cervical area (ENT) in pediatric populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A compilation was made of all the cases of ENT area infections in the pediatric population per month attended to at the Niño Jesús University Children's Hospital from January 2010 to June 2020. Endemic channels and dispersion analysis were designed to analyze the incidence presented in the year 2020, compared to what was expected based on historical data from 2010 to 2019. Then, an epidemiological interview was conducted of the close contacts of COVID-19 of the children who presented a severe ENT infection in 2020. Finally, a serological test of IgG antibodies was performed on all of them to find out if they had overcome the COVID- 19. RESULTS: 620 patients from 1022 were eligible for the study. We observed a significant outbreak in the incidence of complicated mastoiditis and deep cervical infections with complications in the year 2020 (13 patients) linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. From these patients, 54% had been confirmed or had high suspicion of close contact with COVID-19.15.4% of children were positive in serological tests for IgG antibodies. CONCLUSION: There has been a significant increase in mastoiditis and deep cervical infections with complications in the first four months of 2020, which constitutes an outbreak. A considerable number (54%) of these complicated infections were related to close contact with COVID-19. Still, only 15.4% were positive in serological tests for IgG antibodies, so we cannot establish a direct categorical relationship. The limitations in primary care due to a shortage of human resources in dealing with the pandemic's initial onslaught and changes in help-seeking behavior could explain increased complicated infections.","Enrique, Guillén-Lozada; Margarita, Bartolomé-Benito; Ángel, Moreno-Juara; Saturnino, Santos-Santos; María Jesús, Domínguez-González de Rivera",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,,657

396589,A SIR-type model describing the successive waves of COVID–19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rapid implementation of telemedicine for the provision of maternal and newborn healthcare. The objective of this study was to document the experiences with providing telemedicine for maternal and newborn healthcare during the pandemic among healthcare professionals globally. METHODS: The second round of a global online survey of maternal and newborn health professionals was conducted, disseminated in 11 languages. Data were collected between 5 July and 10 September 2020. The questionnaire included questions regarding background, preparedness and response to COVID-19, and experiences with providing telemedicine. Descriptive statistics and qualitative thematic analysis were used to analyse responses, disaggregated by country income level. RESULTS: Responses from 1060 maternal and newborn health professionals were analysed. Telemedicine was used by 58% of health professionals and two-fifths of them reported not receiving guidelines on the provision of telemedicine. Key telemedicine practices included online birth preparedness classes, antenatal and postnatal care by video/phone, a COVID-19 helpline and online psychosocial counselling. Challenges reported lack of infrastructure and technological literacy, limited monitoring, financial and language barriers, lack of non-verbal feedback and bonding, and distrust from patients. Telemedicine was considered as an important alternative to in-person consultations. However, health providers emphasised the lower quality of care and risk of increasing the already existing inequalities in access to healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine has been applied globally to address disruptions of care provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, some crucial aspects of maternal and newborn healthcare seem difficult to deliver by telemedicine. More research regarding the effectiveness, efficacy and quality of telemedicine for maternal healthcare in different contexts is needed before considering long-term adaptations in provision of care away from face-to-face interactions. Clear guidelines for care provision and approaches to minimising socioeconomic and technological inequalities in access to care are urgently needed.","Galle, Anna; Semaan, Aline; Huysmans, Elise; Audet, Constance; Asefa, Anteneh; Delvaux, Therese; Afolabi, Bosede Bukola; El Ayadi, Alison Marie; Benova, Lenka",,,657

METHODS: An observational ICU cohort study including adult patients admitted to the ICU at Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden, from March 13th to June 8th 2020. We compared the clinical, electrophysiological and plasma biomarker data between COVID-19 patients who developed CIN/CIM and those who did not. Electrophysiological characteristics were also compared between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ICU patients. RESULTS: 111 COVID-19 patients were included, 11 of whom developed CIN/CIM. Patients with CIN/CIM had more severe illness; longer ICU stay, more thromboembolic events and were more frequently treated with invasive ventilation for longer than 2 weeks. In particular CIN was more frequent among COVID-19 patients with ICUAW (50%) compared with a non-COVID-19 cohort (0%, p = 0.008). Neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) levels were higher in the CIN/CIM group compared with those that did not develop CIN/CIM (both p = 0.001) and correlated with nerve amplitudes. CONCLUSIONS: CIN/CIM was more prevalent among COVID-19 ICU patients with severe illness. SIGNIFICANCE: COVID-19 patients who later developed CIN/CIM had significantly higher NfL and GFAp in the early phase of ICU care, suggesting their potential as predictive biomarkers for CIN/CIM.","Frithiof, Robert; Rostami, Elham; Kumlien, Eva; Virhammar, Johan; Fällmar, David; Hultström, Michael; Lipcsey, Miklós; Ashton, Nicholas; Blennow, Kaj; Zetterberg, Henrik; Punga, Anna Rostedt",Clin. neurophysiol,,657

Systemic dysregulation observed in SARS-CoV was previously postulated to be due to ACE2/angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7)/Mas axis downregulation; increased ACE2 activity was shown to mediate disease protection. Because angiotensin II receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists increase ACE2 receptor expression, it has been tacitly believed that the use of these agents may facilitate viral disease; thus, they should not be used in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease. Based on the anti-inflammatory benefits of the upregulation of the ACE2/Ang1-7/Mas axis and previously demonstrated benefits of lung function improvement in SARS-CoV infections, it has been hypothesized that the benefits of treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2 may outweigh the risks and at the very least should not be withheld.","Brojakowska, Agnieszka; Narula, Jagat; Shimony, Rony; Bander, Jeffrey",J Am Coll Cardiol,,657

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of ultra-low-dose (ULD) chest CT for detecting viral pneumonia patterns compared to standard (STD) dose chest CT. Methods: All consecutive adult patients with two non-enhanced chest CT acquisitions, one STD and one ULD, for suspicion of viral pneumonia between March 5th and April 2nd 2020 were included. CT results were divided into two groups: non-viral pneumonia CT or compatible with viral pneumonia CT based on viral pneumonia CT patterns: ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy paving, air bronchogram signs and fibrous stripes. The diagnostic performance of ULD CT for suspicion of viral pneumonia was evaluated. For CTs compatible with viral pneumonia, CT pattern detection on ULD CT was assessed and STD CT was used as a reference. Results: The study included 380 patients with 97 CTs (25.5%) compatible with viral pneumonia. The mean effective doses (EDs) were 1.66 ( 1.29;2.18) mSv for STD and 0.20 (0.18;0.22) mSv for ULD CT (P&lt;0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of ULD CT for viral pneumonia detection were 98.9% and 99.0%, respectively. GGO, consolidation and fibrous stripes were equally visible in STD and ULD in 100% (n=97), 36% (n=35) and 23% (n=22) of compatible viral pneumonia-CT patients, respectively. Air bronchogram sign detection was equivalent, concerning 23% (n=22) of patients in STD and 22% (n=21) in ULD. Crazy paving was visible in 24% (n=23) of patients in STD and only 8% (n=8) in ULD (P=0.003).

Our aim was to assess the temporal distribution of mortality risk associated with non-culprit CTO over years after STEMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included 8679 STEMI patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Kaplan-Meier cumulative mortality curves for non-culprit CTO vs. no CTO were compared with log-rank test, with landmarks set at 30 days and 1 year. Adjusted Cox regression models were constructed to assess the impact of non-culprit CTO on mortality over different time intervals. Tests for interaction were pre-specified between non-culprit CTO and acute heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction. The primary outcome variable was all-cause mortality, and the median follow-up was 5 years. Non-culprit CTO was present in 11.6% of patients (n = 1010). Presence of a CTO was associated with increased early [30-day adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54-2.36; P < 0.001] and late mortality (5-year adjusted HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.42-1.95; P < 0.001). Landmark analyses revealed an annual two-fold increase in mortality in patients with vs. without a CTO after the first year of follow-up. The observed pattern of mortality increase over time was independent of acute or chronic LV impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Non-culprit CTO is independently associated with mortality over 5 years after primary PCI for STEMI, with a constant annual two-fold increase in the risk of death beyond the first year of follow-up.","Milasinovic, Dejan; Mladenovic, Djordje; Zaharijev, Stefan; Mehmedbegovic, Zlatko; Marinkovic, Jelena; Jelic, Dario; Zobenica, Vladimir; Radomirovic, Marija; Dedovic, Vladimir; Pavlovic, Andrija; Dobric, Milan; Stojkovic, Sinisa; Asanin, Milika; Vukcevic, Vladan; Stankovic, Goran",European heart journal.

402945,Simulation and assessment of safety procedure in an Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) Laboratory,2021,"The threat of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is increasing. Regarding the differences in the infection rate observed in each region, additionally to studies investigating the causes of differences in population density as a proxy for social distancing, an increasing trend of studies investigating the causes of differences in social capital has also been seen (ie, value sharing, acceptance of norms, unity, and trust through reciprocity). However, studies investigating whether social capital that controls the effects of population density also influences the infection rate are limited. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the relationship between infection rate, population density, and social capital using statistical data of Japan's every prefecture. Statistical analysis showed that social capital not only negatively correlates with infection rates and population densities, but also negatively correlates with infection rates controlling for the effects of population density. Additionally, controlling the relationship between the variables by mean age showed that social capital had a greater correlation with infection rate than population density. In other words, social capital mediates the relationship between population density and infection rates, indicating that social distancing alone is not enough to deter coronavirus disease; social capital needs to be recharged.","Kokubun, Keisuke; Yamakawa, Yoshinori",Inquiry,,657

Public and private partnerships continue to form in order to tackle this unprecedented global challenge. This paper highlights the importance of open collaboration and cooperation between the disciplines of medicine, veterinary medicine, and animal health sciences in the fight against COVID-19. Since the pandemic took the whole world by surprise, many existing drugs were rapidly repurposed and tested in COVID-19 clinical trials and some of the trials are revealing promising results, it is clear that the long-term solution will come in the form of vaccines. While vaccines are being developed, the antiviral agent Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) is being repurposed for use in human clinical trials but this is being done without acknowledging the significant efforts that went into development for treating cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a highly fatal immune-mediated vasculitis in cats which is caused by a feline coronavirus. There are many other antiviral drugs and immune modulating treatments that are currently being trialed that have animal health origins in terms of discovery and clinical development. Closer collaboration between the animal health and human health sectors is likely to accelerate progress in the fight against COVID-19. There is much that we do not yet know about COVID-19 and its causative agent SARS-CoV-2 but we will learn and progress much faster if we increase interdisciplinary collaboration and communication between human and animal health researchers and taking a genuine “One Health” approach to this and other emerging viral pathogens. Enhanced knowledge of zoonotic coronaviruses can significantly enhance our ability to fight current and future emerging coronaviruses.

405600,Software Engineering Standards for Epidemiological Modeling,2020-09-19,"Metabolic reprogramming has been regarded as one of the core hallmarks of cancer and increased de novo fatty acid synthesis has been documented in multiple tumors including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Our previous exome-wide analyses found a Val1937Ile variant (rs17848945) in the 34th exon of fatty acid synthase (FASN) that showed a strong association with the risk of ESCC. In this study, we performed a series of functional assays to investigate the biological functions underlying this variant in the development of ESCC. We demonstrated that FASN was upregulated in ESCC and both knockdown and knockout of FASN significantly inhibited ESCC cell proliferation, suggesting a tumor promoter role for this gene in ESCC. Furthermore, the results showed that overexpression of FASN[I] in the ESCC cells substantially enhanced cell proliferation, compared with overexpression of FASN[V], or the control vector. Intriguingly, we found that the FASN[I] variant can enhance the enzyme activity of FASN, and, thus, increase the amount of the FASN end-product, palmitate in the ESCC cells. We also observed elevated palmitate levels in the plasma of the FASN[I] genotype carriers among a total of 632 healthy Chinese adults. In conclusion, our results suggested that the FASN V1937I variant influenced ESCC cell proliferation and susceptibility by altering the catabolic activity of FASN on palmitate. These findings may highlight an important role of palmitate metabolism in the development of ESCC and may contribute to the personalized medicine of this disease.","Wang, Xiaoyang; Tian, Jianbo; Zhao, Qianyu; Yang, Nan; Ying, Pingting; Peng, Xiating; Zou, Danyi; Zhu, Ying; Zhong, Rong; Gao, Ying; Chang, Jiang; Miao, Xiaoping",Arch. toxicol,,657

METHODS: We surveyed parents with at least one child between the ages of 6 and 12 living in Canada and the United States. We received 483 valid responses that were analysed using structural equation modelling approach with bootstrapping to test the hypothetical path model and its invariance across the moderators. RESULTS: The analysis revealed that pressure to eat fully mediated the effects of childhood food allergy and restriction on parental unhealthy food choices for their children. Finally, we found that parental gender moderated the relationship between childhood food allergy and the pressure to eat. CONCLUSIONS: The paper contributes to the literature on food allergies among children and the marginalisation of families with allergies. Our explorative model is a first of its kind and offers a fresh perspective on complex relationships between variables under consideration. Although our data collection took place prior to Covid-19 outbreak, this paper bears yet particular significance as it casts light on how families with allergies should be part of the priority groups to have access to food supply during crisis periods.","Mahmoud, Ali B; Hack-Polay, Dieu; Fuxman, Leonora; Naquiallah, Dina; Grigoriou, Nicholas",BMC Public Health,,657
405858,Viral disease spreading in grouped population,2020,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global public health problem. The SARS-CoV-2 triggers hyper-activation of inflammatory and immune responses resulting in cytokine storm and increased inflammatory responses on several organs like lungs, kidneys, intestine, and placenta. Although SARS-CoV-2 affects individuals of all age groups and physiological statuses, immune-compromised individuals such as pregnant women are considered as a highly vulnerable group. This review aims to raise the concerns of high risk of infection, morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in pregnant women and provides critical reviews of pathophysiology and pathobiology of how SARS-CoV-2 infection potentially increases the severity and fatality during pregnancy. This article also provides a discussion of current evidence on vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Lastly, guidelines on management, treatment, preventive, and mitigation strategies of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and pregnancy-related conditions such as delivery and breastfeeding are discussed.","Kumar, Rakesh; Yeni, Cut Meurah; Utami, Niken Asri; Masand, Rupali; Asrani, Rajesh Kumar; Patel, Shailesh Kumar; Kumar, Akshay; Yatoo, Mohd Iqbal; Tiwari, Ruchi; Natesan, Senthilkumar; Vora, Kranti Suresh; Nainu, Firzan; Bilal, Muhammad; Dhawan, Manish; Emran, Talha Bin; Ahmad, Tauseef; Harapan, Harapan; Dhama, Kuldeep",J Infect Public Health,,657

409157,A deep learning modeling framework to capture mixing patterns in reactive-transport systems,2021-01-11,"Delirium is a common presentation in older inpatients with COVID-19, and a risk factor for cognitive decline at discharge. The glaring gaps in the service provision in delirium care, regardless of aetiology, after a hospital admission pre-existed the pandemic, but the pandemic arguably offers an opportunity now to address them. Whilst a delirium episode in itself is not a long-term condition, the context of it may well be, and therefore patients might benefit from personalised care and support planning. There is no reason to believe that the delirium following COVID-19 is fundamentally different from any other delirium. We propose that the needs of older patients who have experienced delirium including from COVID-19 could be addressed through a new model of post-acute delirium care that combines early supported discharge, including discharge-to-assess, with community-based follow-up to assess for persistent delirium and early new long-term cognitive impairment. Such a drive could be structurally integrated with existing memory clinic services. To succeed, such an ambition has to be both flexible, adaptable and person-centred. To understand the impact on resource and service utilisation, techniques of quality improvement should be implemented, and appropriate metrics reflecting both process and outcome will be essential to underpin robust and sustainable business cases to support implementation of delirium care as a long-term solution.","Rahman, Shibley; Byatt, Kit",Age ageing,,657
409205,Pandemic Design: Protective Mask Utilizing Non-endagered Components,2021,"This study aims to study the immune response and evaluate the performances of four new IgM and five IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for detecting anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies against different antigens in symptomatic and asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. A total of 291 samples collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed patients were used to evaluate the ELISA kits' performance (EDI, AnshLabs, DiaPro, NovaLisa, and Lionex). The sensitivity was measured at three different time-intervals post symptoms onset or positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test (&#8804;14, 14-30, >30 days). The specificity was investigated using 119 pre-pandemic serum samples. The sensitivity of all IgM kits gradually decreased with time, ranging from 48.7% (EDI)-66.4% (Lionex) at &#8804;14 days, 29.1% (NovaLisa)-61.8% (Lionex) at 14-30 days, and 6.0% (AnshLabs)-47.9% (Lionex) at >30 days. The sensitivity of IgG kits increased with time, peaking in the latest interval (>30 days) at 96.6% (Lionex). Specificity of IgM ranged from 88.2% (Lionex)-99.2% (EDI), while IgG ranged from 75.6% (DiaPro)-98.3% (Lionex). Among all RT-PCR-positive patients, 23 samples (7.9%) were seronegative by all IgG kits, of which only seven samples (30.4%) had detectable IgM antibodies. IgM assays have variable and low sensitivity, thus considered a poor marker for COVID-19 diagnosis. IgG assays can miss at least 8% of RT-PCR-positive cases.","Al-Jighefee, Hadeel T; Yassine, Hadi M; Nasrallah, Gheyath K",,,657
409301,"Automatic detection of COVID-19 from chest CT scan and chest X-Rays images using deep learning, transfer learning and stacking",2021,"OBJECTIVE: To report six consecutive patients with confirmed coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) who underwent Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography evaluation for cerebral microemboli in the setting of suspected or confirmed acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: Patient data were obtained from medical records from Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL between May and June 2020. All patients with confirmed COVID-19 who underwent clinical TCD ultrasonography for microemboli detection were included. RESULTS: A total of eight TCD studies were performed in six patients with COVID-19 (4 men and 2 women, median age 65±5), four with confirmed ischemic stroke and two with refractory encephalopathy. Microemboli were detected in three male patients, two patients had suffered a confirmed ischemic stroke and one who developed prolonged encephalopathy. Microemboli of varying intensity were identified in multiple vascular territories in two patients, and microemboli persisted despite therapeutic anticoagulation in a third patient. Of the three patients without evidence of microemboli on TCD ultrasonography, two patients had suffered a confirmed ischemic stroke, while one remained with refractory encephalopathy. CONCLUSIONS: TCD ultrasonography for microemboli detection identified three patients with confirmed COVID-19 with evidence of cerebral arterial microemboli, including one who was therapeutically anticoagulated. TCD ultrasonography provides a non-invasive method for evaluating cerebral microemboli in patients with COVID-19 and may be useful in assessing response to treatment in cases with suspected or confirmed disorders of hypercoagulability. Further studies investigating the prevalence of cerebral microemboli and associated risk factors are needed to characterize their pathogenic mechanism and guide therapeutic interventions in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Batra, Ayush; Clark, Jeffrey R; LaHaye, Katie; Shlobin, Nathan A; Hoffman, Steven C; Orban, Zachary S; Colton, Katharine; Dematte, Jane E; Sorond, Farzaneh A; Koralnik, Igor J; Liotta, Eric M",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,657

As the first point of contact with the medical system, family practices require physically and psychologically sound and a well-motivated family doctors at all times. This is because an error can lead to loss of lives as gatekeepers of the medical system. Our study explored the extent to which positive psychological capital promotes higher performance among family doctors. METHODS: A questionnaire was used to collect data from family doctors in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beijing. We applied a structural equation analysis to analyze the causal relationship among the variables. RESULTS: We found out that psychological well-being and job involvement significantly influences the performance of family doctors in China. The study also noted that psychological capital moderates the relationship between psychological well-being attainment, job involvement, and performance. CONCLUSIONS: Studies have shown that these pressures affect their well-being considerably. For this reason, a healthcare professional who experiences positive emotions affects the total behavior which culminates into performance.","Xu, Xinglong; Zhou, Lulin; Asante-Antwi, Henry; Boafo-Arthur, Ama; Mustafa, Tehzeeb",BMC Fam Pract,,657

In 2020, the program was moved online due to coronavirus disease 2019. The purpose of this study was to determine whether it is feasible and effective to provide faculty development programs online in terms of clinical teachers' participation and satisfaction in comparison with offline programs. METHODS: Clinical teachers participated in the clinical teaching methods programs offline in 2019 and online in 2020. We analyzed participation rate and satisfaction level. All surveys items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale. We also interviewed instructors about the advantages and drawbacks of the online program. RESULTS: The participation rate of the online program (89.5%) was significantly higher than that of the offline program (67.8%). The overall satisfaction level for the online program (4.37) was similar to that for the offline program (4.50). CONCLUSION: Faculty development programs online are feasible and effective in medical education. We need to design training content that fits online programs, consider various online training methods to reinforce the strengths of online programs, and support participants to make good use of these programs.","Im, Ji Hyun; Kim, Ju Whi; Park, Wan Beom; Han, Ilkyu; Lee, Seung Hee; Shin, Jwa Seop; Yoon, Hyun Bae",Korean J Med Educ,,657

Consequently, there was a necessity to shift medical teaching and assessment online. Our challenge was to logistically organise and conduct an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) using a virtual, socially distanced approach. METHODS: We found that Zoom offered the most suitable functionality in mimicking a physical OSCE online and its breakout rooms were used to represent different stations. One organiser manually transferred candidates between stations, allowing for the OSCE to operate punctually. Examiners screen shared to display an automated slideshow with station vignettes, investigation results, and viva questions. RESULTS: Participants found the use of Zoom's features to be extremely beneficial with one candidate describing the experience as 'brilliant, very efficient and smooth'. Numerous aspects of the OSCE from decision making, to verbal communication, to medical knowledge were assessed, equivalent to a physical OSCE. DISCUSSION: As the transformation of medical education is catalysed by the pandemic, it is important to ensure that peer to peer teaching and assessments are revolutionised with a quality similar to that of physical teaching. We have displayed how this may be achieved in an OSCE setting using Zoom teleconferencing.","Hannan, Tufayl A; Umar, Safwan Y; Rob, Zakaria; Choudhury, Rakin R",Med Teach,,657

Selenium concentration varies greatly depending on the geographic area. Consequently, the content of selenium in food products is also variable. It is known that low Se is associated with increased incidence of cancer and heart diseases. Therefore, it is advisable to supplement diet with this element albeit in a proper form. Although blood increased concentrations of Se can be achieved with various pharmacological preparations, only one chemical form (sodium selenite) can offer a true protection. Sodium selenite, but not selenate, can oxidize thiol groups in the virus protein disulfide isomerase rendering it unable to penetrate the healthy cell membrane. In this way selenite inhibits the entrance of viruses into the healthy cells and abolish their infectivity. Therefore, this simple chemical compound can potentially be used in the recent battle against coronavirus epidemic.","Kieliszek, Marek; Lipinski, Boguslaw",Med Hypotheses,,657

The population size of each capital was used as a control variable, with data obtained from Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística. Spearman rank correlation tests were utilized to examine the correlation between variables. Results: The analysis showed a significant and strong positive correlation between the total cases of COVID-19 and the population size (p<0,01). There was a significant positive correlation with the average humidity of the air and cumulative cases (p<0,05). There was no significant correlation with other climate variables. Conclusion: Our results confront some expectations commented around the world about a possible seasonality of COVID-19 during periods of low humidity and can assist government and health authorities in decision making to control the pandemic.

New York currently represents an epicenter for COVID-19 infection in the United States, with 84,735 cases reported as of April 2, 2020. We previously presented an early experience with seven COVID-positive patients in pregnancy, including two women who were diagnosed with COVID-19 following an asymptomatic initial presentation. We now describe a series of 43 test-confirmed cases of COVID-19 presenting to a pair of affiliated New York City hospitals over two weeks from March 13 to 27, 2020. Fourteen (32.6%) patients presented without any COVID-associated viral symptoms, and were identified either after developing symptoms during admission or following the implementation of universal testing for all obstetrical admissions on March 22. Of these, 10/14 (71.4%) developed symptoms or signs of COVID-19 infection over the course of their delivery admission or early after postpartum discharge. Of the other 29 (67.4%) patients who presented with symptomatic COVID-19 infection, three women ultimately required antenatal admission for viral symptoms, and an additional patient represented six days postpartum after a successful labor induction with worsening respiratory status that required oxygen supplementation. There were no confirmed cases of COVID-19 detected in neonates upon initial testing on the first day of life. Applying COVID-19 disease severity characteristics as described by Wu et al, 37 (86%) women possessed mild disease, four (9.3%) exhibited severe disease, and two (4.7%) developed critical disease; these percentages are similar to those described for non-pregnant adults with COVID-19 infections (about 80% mild, 15% severe, and 5% critical disease).","Breslin, Noelle; Baptiste, Caitlin; Gyamfi-Bannerman, Cynthia; Miller, Russell; Martinez, Rebecca; Bernstein, Kyra; Ring, Laurence; Landau, Ruth; Purisch, Stephanie; Friedman, Alexander M; Fuchs, Karin; Sutton, Desmond; Andrikopoulou, Maria; Rupley, Devon; Sheen, Jean-Ju; Aubey, Janice; Zork, Noelia; Moroz, Leslie; Mourad, Mirella; Wapner, Ronald; Simpson, Lynn L; D039,; Alton, Mary E; Goffman, Dena",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,,657
416605,ModCOVNN: a convolutional neural network approach in COVID-19 prognosis,2021,"Fast, reliable and point-of-care systems to detect the SARS-CoV-2 infection are crucial to contain viral spreading and to adopt timely clinical treatments. Many of the rapid detection tests currently in use are based on antibodies that bind viral proteins1. However, newly appearing virus variants accumulate mutations in their RNA sequence and produce proteins, such as Spike, that may show reduced binding affinity to these diagnostic antibodies, resulting in less reliable tests and in the need for continuous update of the sensing systems2. Here we propose a graphene field-effect transistor (gFET) biosensor which exploits the key interaction between the Spike protein and the human ACE2 receptor. This interaction is one of the determinants of host infections and indeed recently evolved Spike variants were shown to increase affinity for ACE2 receptor3. Through extensive computational analyses we show that a chimeric ACE2-Fc construct mimics the ACE2 dimer, normally present on host cells membranes, better than its soluble truncated form. We demonstrate that ACE2-Fc functionalized gFET is effective for in vitro detection of Spike and outperforms the same chip functionalized with either a diagnostic antibody or the soluble ACE2. Our sensor is implemented in a portable, wireless, point-of-care device and successfully detected both alpha and gamma virus variants in patients clinical samples. As incomplete immunization, due to vaccine roll-out, may offer new selective grounds for antibody-escaping virus variants4, our biosensor opens to a class of highly sensitive, rapid and variant-robust SARS-CoV-2 detection systems.","D'Agostino, Mattia; Pavoni, Eleonora; Romagnoli, Alice; Ardiccioni, Chiara; Motta, Stefano; Crippa, Paolo; Biagetti, Giorgio; Notarstefano, Valentina; Barocci, Simone; Costabile, Brianna K; Colasurdo, Gabriele; Caucci, Sara; Mencarelli, Davide; Turchetti, Claudio; Farina, Marco; Pierantoni, Luca; Teana, Anna La; Hadi, Richard Al; Chinappi, Mauro; Trucchi, Emiliano; Mancia, Filippo; Rocca, Blasco Morozzo della; D'Annessa, Ilda; Marino, Daniele Di",,,657

However, there is no consensus on the timing of a tracheostomy in patients on VV-ECMO for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The present report described the optimal timing of tracheostomy for these patients. Method The present study was a single-center case series. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of nine consecutive patients who underwent tracheostomy either during or after VV-ECMO treatment in our center between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020. Results All the patients received a percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy, which was performed during VV-ECMO in four patients. Three of these patients experienced hemorrhagic complications, and the remaining patient required a circuit change on the day after the operation. Heparin was discontinued 8 h preoperatively and resumed 1?14 h later. The platelet count was below normal in two patients, but no transfusion was performed. APTT was almost normal, and D-dimer was elevated postoperatively. The remaining five patients received a tracheostomy after weaning off VV-ECMO, and no complication was observed. Eight patients were deeply sedated during VV-ECMO to prioritize lung rest and prevent infecting the healthcare workers. Conclusion In the present study, patients who underwent a tracheostomy during VV-ECMO tended to have more hemorrhagic complications. Because an early tracheostomy during ECMO has little benefit for patients with COVID-19, it should be performed after weaning off VV-ECMO to protect the safety of the healthcare workers concerned.","Matsuyoshi, Takeo Shimizu Keiki Kaneko Hitoshi Kohsen Daiyu Suzuki Hiroaki Sato Yuichi Hamaguchi Jun",Acute Medicine &amp; Surgery,,657

We aimed to evaluate PE distribution on CTA and to investigate any possible association with D-dimer (DD), pulmonary stage of disease and prognosis. METHOD: COVID-19 patients of two affiliated Hospitals, undergone a CTA examination for PE suspicion, were retrospectively enrolled. Comorbidities, laboratory tests and clinical outcomes (hospitalization, discharge, death) were assessed. A parenchymal stage (early, progressive, peak, absorption) for lung involvement was assigned. RESULTS: A cohort of 114 patients (mean age 61 years; 26.3 % females) with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. At last follow-up 25 (21.9 %) were hospitalized, 72 (63.2 %) discharged, 17 (14.9 %) dead. Eighty-eight patients (77.2 %) had at least one comorbidity, being cardiovascular ones the most frequent (44.7 %). CTA revealed PE in 65 patients (57 %), with concomitant pulmonary trunk and/or main arteries involvement in 16.9 %. PE defects were ubiquitous in 18.5 % of cases. The predominant parenchymal stages were the progressive (24.6 %) and peak (67.7 %). DD levels showed a significant correlation with PE occurrence and extent in pulmonary branches, despite anticoagulant therapies; trend of correlation with pulmonary stages was also noted. CONCLUSIONS: PE is a frequent complication in severe COVID-19 patients, particularly during central parenchymal stages and despite ongoing anticoagulant therapy. CTA and DD levels play a crucial role in the assessment of suspected PE, despite anticoagulant therapies, along with proper information about lung involvement extent.","Valle, C; Bonaffini, P A; Dal Corso, M; Mercanzin, E; Franco, P N; Sonzogni, A; Vacca, G; Gianatti, A; Sironi, S",Eur J Radiol,,657
422837,Robust Screening of COVID-19 from Chest X-ray via Discriminative Cost-Sensitive Learning,2020-04-27,"BACKGROUND: Buprenorphine-based medication-assisted treatment (B-MAT) is a powerful, concrete intervention that can be provided by nurse practitioners (NPs) to reduce opioid-related overdoses in patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). However, multiple barriers exist to provide and access this therapy. LOCAL PROBLEM: A rural Midwestern county struggled with increasing OUD and scant access to B-MAT. A nurse-led, community clinic had the potential to expand access to treatment but no support structure to provide it. METHODS: In this quality improvement project, a one-group posttest-only design was used to assess treatment access, care quality, and patient characteristics. INTERVENTIONS: An evidence-based, nurse led weekly B-MAT clinic using a low-threshold, chronic-care model for treatment of OUD. RESULTS: The B-MAT clinic expanded county-wide access by 34% over seven months. A total of 23 patients were seen with 21 eligible for treatment with B-MAT. All nine patients with at least 90-day continuous treatment were retained in the program. Three quarters of patients had at least 30 days of active buprenorphine-naloxone coverage and 17% of all patients were lost to follow up. There were no induction-related adverse events, no fatalities, and one nonfatal overdose. In a chart review, 85% of patients met at least six of eight quality criteria. CONCLUSIONS: This low-barrier approach to OUD expanded access to treatment and demonstrated a model stable enough to continue delivering care throughout the first 5 months of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. NPs in primary care settings can effectively provide B-MAT in a low-threshold, office-based setting.","Carroll, Emily",J Am Assoc Nurse Pract (Online),,657
423128,Transfer-to-Transfer Learning Approach for Computer Aided Detection of COVID-19 in Chest Radiographs,2020,"Although COVID-19 largely causes respiratory complications, it can also lead to various extrapulmonary manifestations resulting in higher mortality and these comorbidities are posing a challenge to the health care system. Reports indicate that 30-60% of patients with COVID-19 suffer from neurological symptoms. To understand the molecular basis of the neurologic comorbidity in COVID-19 patients, we have investigated the genetic association between COVID-19 and various brain disorders through a systems biology-based network approach and observed a remarkable resemblance. Our results showed 123 brain-related disorders associated with COVID-19 and form a high-density disease-disease network. The brain-disease-gene network revealed five highly clustered modules demonstrating a greater complexity of COVID-19 infection. Moreover, we have identified 35 hub proteins of the network which were largely involved in the protein catabolic process, cell cycle, RNA metabolic process, and nuclear transport. Perturbing these hub proteins by drug repurposing will improve the clinical conditions in comorbidity. In the near future, we assumed that in COVID-19 patients, many other neurological manifestations will likely surface. Thus, understanding the infection mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and associated comorbidity is a high priority to contain its short- and long-term effects on human health. Our network-based analysis strengthens the understanding of the molecular basis of the neurological manifestations observed in COVID-19 and also suggests drug for repurposing.","Prasad, Kartikay; AlOmar, Suliman Yousef; Alqahtani, Saeed Awad M; Malik, Md Zubbair; Kumar, Vijay",Mol.

This underscores the importance of structured methods to continue critical medical research safely and efficiently. Methods: We report the impact of a phased trial reopening strategy, remote research staffing, and telemedicine on cancer trial enrollment at one of the largest Radiation Oncology academic cancer centers. In Phase 1, trials investigating definitive therapeutic benefit were opened, followed by trials not increasing patient exposure or pulmonary toxicity risk in Phase 2. During Phase 2.5, multicenter trials reopened and limited research staff were allowed on-site. Results: Despite initial enrollment declines during the early pandemic, the percentage of new patients enrolling in clinical trials from March to August 2020 was 8.8%, and represented an 10.5% relative increase from 2019. Monthly accrual enrollment from March to August 2019 ranged from 42-71 compared to enrollment during COVID-19 from 23-73 patients (p<0.001). Conclusions: Through a phased approach to trial reopening and adaptive techniques, the Division of Radiation Oncology maintained cancer trial accrual during the COVID-19 pandemic. The experience may help centers maintain accrual, preserve clinical trial integrity, and minimize risk to patients and staff.","Yeboa, Debra Nana; Akinfenwa, Chidinma Anakwenze; Nguyen, Jonathan; Amaya, Diana; de Gracia, Beth; Ning, Matthew; Cox, Victoria; De, Brian; Smith, Benjamin D; Lin, Lili; Beddar, Sam; Hoang, Hanh; Koong, Albert; Liao, Zhongxing",Adv Radiat Oncol,,657

Previously, we have shown that N-glycosylation of recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike of IBV-M41 is of critical importance for binding to chicken trachea tissue. Here we investigated the role of N-glycosylation of the RBD on receptor specificity and virus replication in the context of the virus particle. Using our reverse genetics system we were able to generate recombinant IBVs for nine-out-of-ten individual N-glycosylation mutants. In vitro growth kinetics of these viruses were comparable to the virus containing the wild-type M41-S1. Furthermore, Neu5Ac binding by the recombinant viruses containing single N-glycosylation site knock-out mutations matched the Neu5Ac binding observed with the recombinant RBDs. Five N-glycosylation mutants lost the ability to bind Neu5Ac and gained binding to a different, yet unknown, sialylated glycan receptor on host cells. These results demonstrate that N-glycosylation of IBV is a determinant for receptor specificity.","Bouwman, K M; Habraeken, N; Laconi, A; Berends, A J; Groenewoud, L; Alders, M; Kemp, V; Verheije, M H",J Gen Virol,,657

Interferons (IFNs) are the major cytokines of the antiviral defense system released from many cell types. However, IFN-Î³ plays a key role in both primary and secondary cytokine storms. If the cytokine storm is not treated urgently, it will be fatal; therefore, it should be treated immediately. Anakinra, an interleukin-1 (IL-1) antagonist, tocilizumab, an IL-6 antagonist, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are successfully used in cytokine storm caused by COVID-19. However, sometimes, despite these treatments, the patient's clinical course does not improve. Emapalumab (Eb) is the human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody and is a potent and noncompetitive antagonist of IFN-Î³. Eb can be life saving for cytokine storm caused by COVID-19, which is resistant to anakinra, tocilizumab, and JAK inhibitors.","Cure, Erkan; Kucuk, Adem; Cure, Medine Cumhur",Indian J Pharmacol,,657

There is now a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that severe SARS-CoV-2 infections can develop clinically significant coagulopathy, inflammation, and cardiomyopathy, which have been implicated in COVID-19-associated cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). CASE REPORT: We report an uncommon presentation of a 32-year-old man who sustained a large vessel cerebellar stroke associated with a severe COVID-19 infection. He presented with a headache, worse than his usual migraine, dizziness, rotary nystagmus, and dysmetria on examination, but had no respiratory symptoms initially. He was not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy or endovascular therapy and was managed with clopidogrel, aspirin, and atorvastatin. During hospital admission he developed COVID-19-related hypoxia and pneumonia, but ultimately he was discharged to home rehabilitation. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: We present this case to increase awareness among emergency physicians of the growing number of reports of neurologic and vascular complications, such as ischemic CVAs, in otherwise healthy individuals who are diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A brief review of the current literature will help elucidate possible mechanisms, risk factors, and current treatments for CVA associated with SARS-CoV-2.","Quenzer, Faith; Smyres, Cameron; Tabarez, Norma; Singh, Sukhdeep; LaFree, Andrew; Tomaszewski, Christian; Hayden, Stephen R",J. emerg. med,,657

In COVID-19 patients, the higher prevalence of neurological symptoms and the lack of dyspnea may suggest common underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. The aim of this preliminary study is to address whether there is a lack of dyspnea in COVID-19 patients and if there is a relationship between neurological symptoms and the perception of dyspnea. METHODS: A structured interview regarding the occurrence of subjective neurological symptoms was performed and coupled with a questionnaire about the intensity and qualities of dyspnea. Respiratory rate (RR) and an arterial blood gas on room air were concurrently evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (age 68.4 ± 13.9 years, 13 males and 9 females) were included and divided into two groups according to the Borg dyspnea scale: dyspneic patients BU &#8805; 1(DYSP) and non-dyspneic patients BU < 1 (NDYSP). The prevalence of dyspnea overall was 31.8%. The prevalence of neurological symptoms, dyspnea descriptors, RR, pH, PaCO2, PaO2, or lactate was similar between groups. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that the prevalence of dyspnea is low in non-severe COVID-19 patients, but contrary to our hypothesis of a relationship between shortness of breath and neurological symptoms, we have not been able to find any evidence of an impairment in dyspnea perception, either in the DYSP or NDYSP group.","Ora, Josuel; Liguori, Claudio; Puxeddu, Ermanno; Coppola, Angelo; Matino, Matteo; Pierantozzi, Mariangela; Mercuri, Nicola Biagio; Rogliani, Paola",Neurol Sci,,657

Prevention is of paramount importance to protect the high-risk group of the elderly when specific treatments for COVID-19 are not yet available, despite that, little work has been done to explore factors that promote preventive behaviors among this population. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the knowledge, perceived beliefs, and preventive behaviors of elderly population in China towards COVID-19 and determine factors that influence the practice of preventive behaviors. METHODS: From February 19 to March 19, 2020, a cross-sectional, internet-based survey was administered to Chinese elderly in all of the 31 provinces in mainland China using a convenience sampling method to assess their knowledge, perceived beliefs, and preventive behaviors towards COVID-19. Standard descriptive statistics and hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 1501 participants responded to the survey, with 1263 valid responses left for further analysis. The overall correct rate on the knowledge questionnaire was 87%, an overall positive belief towards COVID-19 was found and the mean score of behavior was 13.73(SD 1.62, range 5-15). The hierarchical linear regression showed that respondents who were married or in cohabitation, and lived in areas with community-level control measures were more likely to practice preventive behaviors(P<.01). Knowledge ( ß=0.198, P<.05), perceived susceptibility ( ß=0.263, P=.03), perceived benefits ( ß=0.643, P<.001), and self-efficacy in preventing COVID-19 ( ß=0.468, P<.001) were also found to be significantly associated with preventive behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Most elderly residents had adequate knowledge, positive beliefs and proactive behaviors towards COVID-19. Knowledge and beliefs were confirmed to be significantly associated with behavior responses. Our findings have significant implications in enhancing the effectiveness of COVID-19 prevention programs targeting the elderly population, which needs to be continued and strengthened as the epidemic has not yet come to an end.","Chen, Ying; Zhou, Rui; Chen, Boyan; Chen, Hao; Li, Ying; Chen, Zhi; Zhu, Haihong; Wang, Hongmei",J. med. internet res,,657

Therefore, the necessity to find out the potential therapeutic pharmaceuticals is imperious. This study investigates the inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) using caffeine and caffeine-containing pharmaceuticals (3CPs) based on molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations by means of molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA) and molecular mechanics-generalized-Born surface area (MMGBSA). Of these 3CPs, seven drugs approved by the US-Food and Drug Administration have shown a good binding affinity to the catalytic residues of 3CLpro of His41 and Cys145: caffeine, theophylline, dyphylline, pentoxifylline, linagliptin, bromotheophylline and istradefylline. Their binding affinity score ranged from -4.9 to -8.6 kcal/mol. The molecular dynamic simulation in an aqueous solution of docked complexes demonstrated that the 3CPs conformations bound to the active sites of 3CLpro during 200 ns molecular dynamics simulations. The free energy of binding also confirms the stability of the 3CPs-3CLpro complexes. To our knowledge, this in silico study shows for the first time very inexpensive drugs available in large quantities that can be potential inhibitors against 3CLpro. In particular, the repurposing of linagliptin, and caffeine are recommended for COVID-19 treatment after in vitro, in vivo and clinical trial validation. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Even if families are able to afford tuition, rural schools provide poor-quality vocational training with predominantly unqualified teachers, leaving students without the math or science knowledge necessary for high-skilled labor.6 To address these concerns, the authors suggest that the Chinese government either significantly reduce tuition costs or make academic high school entirely free. [...]they encourage the use of conditional cash transfers to serve as a financial incentive for families to keep their children in school and pursue a serious strategic overhaul in government funding for rural education.7 However, Rozelle and Hell still find these policies insufficient to fully address the rural youth’s inability to access education, as the most alarming issues begin outside of the classroom.

Technology-based care has received buy-in from all participants, and the need for technological assistance has been prioritized. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the initial perceptions and experiences of interprofessional behavioral health providers about shifting from traditional face-to-face care to virtual technologies (telephonic and televideo) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A survey-based study was performed at a large, integrated medical health care system in West-Central Florida that rapidly implemented primary care provision via telephone and televideo as of March 18, 2020. A 23-item anonymous survey based on a 7-point Likert scale was developed to determine health care providers' perceptions about telephonic and televideo care. The survey took 10 minutes to complete and was administered to 280 professionals between April 27 and May 11, 2020. RESULTS: In all, 170 respondents completed the survey in entirety, among which 78.8% (134/170) of the respondents were female and primarily aged 36-55 years (89/170, 52.4%). A majority of the respondents were outpatient-based providers (159/170, 93.5%), including psychiatrists, therapists, counselors, and advanced practice nurses. Most of them (144/170, 84.7%) had used televideo for less than 1 year; they felt comfortable and satisfied with either telephonic or televideo mode and that they were able to meet the patients' needs. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey findings suggest that health care providers valued televideo visits equally or preferred them more than telephonic visits in the domains of quality of care, technology performance, satisfaction of technology, and user acceptance.","Wright, Jesse; Dewan, Shyam; Hilty, Donald; Dewan, Naakesh A",JMIR Ment Health,,657

There have been some attempts to use some of these drugs in combination. However, using more than one drug together may cause serious side effects on patients. Therefore, detecting drug-drug interactions of the drugs used will be of great importance in the treatment of Covid 19. In this study, the interactions of 8 drugs used for Covid 19 treatment with 645 different drugs and possible side effects estimates have been produced using Graph Convolutional Networks. As a result of the experiments, it has been found that the hematopoietic system and the cardiovascular system are exposed to more side effects than other organs. Among the focused drugs, Heparin and Atazanavir appear to cause more adverse reactions than other drugs. In addition, as it is known that some of these 8 drugs are used together in Covid-19 treatment, the side effects caused by using these drugs together are shared. With the experimental results obtained, it is aimed to facilitate the selection of the drugs and increase the success of Covid 19 treatment according to the targeted patient.","Aygün, Irfan; Kaya, Mehmet; Alhajj, Reda",Sci Rep,,657

Age-specific critical points were identified at ages 8 and 13 where depression symptoms spiked for a minority of children. Most depression risk was due to dynamic responses to environmental events, drawn not from a small pool of persistently depressed children, but a larger pool of children who varied across higher and lower symptom levels.","Hawrilenko, Matt; Masyn, Katherine E; Cerutti, Janine; Dunn, Erin C",Child. dev,,657
462434,A five-layer deep convolutional neural network with stochastic pooling for chest CT-based COVID-19 diagnosis,2021,"Introduction: Since the emergence of COVID 19 in December 2019, its clinical and radiological features are still being discovered and their prognostic implications evaluated. Chest X-ray (CXR) typically shows patchy or diffuse asymmetric airspace opacities. Regardless of the different classifications of radiological findings that have been used, it is becoming clear that multi-lobar changes in the lungs are associated with poorer outcomes than single lobar involvement or minimal/no radiological abnormalities. Aim: To assess the correlation of age with the extent of CXR findings in hospitalized COVID 19 patients. Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis was carried out on inpatients with RTPCR confirmedCOVID 19. Chest X-ray findings were classified asminimal/no radiological changes, single lobar opacification and multi-lobar changes (involving 2 or more lobes and/or ARDS changes). SPSS 26 software was used for statistical analysis. Spearman's correlation and linear regression were used to assess correlation. Results: 211 patients were included in the analysis;124 males and 87 females. Mean age of the patients was 72.4 years;SD +/-16.15. There was significant positive correlation between age and degree and extent of radiological changes in all patients (r=0.367;p&lt;0.01). This correlation persisted even when broken down by gender (r=0.448;p&lt;0.01) for males and (r=0.322;p&lt;0.01) for females. Discussion: Older age has been repeatedly reported as a risk factor for poor prognosis in COVID 19. The main findings of COVID-19 on CXR are those of atypical or organizing pneumonia. Older people tend to have more extensive involvement of the lungs. There could be many explanations for the CXR correlation with age including the diminished cardiovascular reserve with ageing, the accumulation of comorbidities and decreased or abnormal immune response. Conclusion: Age significantly correlate with the extent of chest radiographic findings in inpatients with COVID 19.","Fernandez, A.; Michael, A.; Obiechina, N.; Nandi, A.; Koh, J.",Age and Ageing,,657

With increasing usage, there has been growing concern about the prolongation of QTc interval and Torsades de Pointes (TdP) with HCQ, especially in combination with azithromycin. AIMS: This meta-analysis is planned to study the risk of QTc prolongation and Torsades de pointes (TdP) by a well-defined criterion for HCQ, CQ alone, and in combination with Azithromycin in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was made in two databases (PubMed, Embase). Three outcomes explored in the included studies were frequency of QTc > 500 ms (ms) or &#916;QTc > 60 ms (Outcome 1), frequency of QTc > 500 ms (Outcome 2) and frequency of TdP (Outcome 3). Random effects method with inverse variance approach was used for computation of pooled summary and risk ratio. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies comprising of 2138 patients were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of outcome 1, outcome 2 and outcome 3 for HCQ, CQ with or without Azithromycin were 10.18% (5.59-17.82%, I2 - 92%), 10.22% (6.01-16.85%, I2 - 79%), and 0.72% (0.34-1.51, I2 - 0%) respectively. The prevalence of outcome 2 in subgroup analysis for HCQ and HCQ + Azithromycin was 7.25% (3.22-15.52, I2 - 59%) and 8.61% (4.52-15.79, I2 - 76%), respectively. The risk ratio (RR) for outcome 1 and outcome 2 between HCQ + Azithromycin and HCQ was 1.22 (0.77-1.93, I2 - 0%) & 1.51 (0.79-2.87, I2 - 13%), respectively and was not significant. Heterogeneity was noted statistically as well clinically (regimen types, patient numbers, study design, and outcome definition). CONCLUSION: The use of HCQ/CQ is associated with a high prevalence of QTc prolongation.

470435,Masked Face Recognition using ResNet-50,2021-04-19,"PURPOSE: Cancer-related biopsychosocial distress is highly prevalent across the cancer care continuum. The implementation of screening patients for biopsychosocial distress has become a standard of practice in cancer care. With the presence of COVID-19, clinical care has shifted from in-person care to virtual care in many instances. One of the realities of COVID-19 is the significant decrease in screening patients for biopsychosocial symptom burden. METHODS: Given that screening for distress has become an accreditation standard in many cancer programs, in the province of Alberta, Canada, all patients are screened for distress with every visit to the cancer centre. Given the presence of COVID-19, much of cancer care has shifted to being delivered virtually (through mediums such as Zoom). In this paper, we present pre- and post-COVID data on the frequency of distress screening and its impact on patient care. RESULTS: A review of pre- and post-COVID-19 screening for distress questionnaires revealed that patients who received virtual care were less satisfied in the areas of emotional support and received less resources and referrals to supportive care. CONCLUSION: The rapid integration of virtual care without the inclusion of a standardized distress screening tool was akin to a natural experiment, as two groups (virtual and in-person clinic patients) received different levels of care and interventions. Without the inclusion of distress screening, the clinical conversation around symptoms is less likely to occur and results in fewer referrals to best practices in supportive care services. Lessons learned about virtual cancer care without distress screening in the time of COVID-19 demonstrates significantly fewer patients being screened for distress and subsequently has resulted in less supportive care referrals. Going forward, we must find ways to ensure that virtual cancer care continues to support distress screening and best patient-centric care.","Bultz, Barry D; Watson, Linda",Support. care cancer,,657

The Perception of Threat from COVID-19 questionnaire, the Affective Balance Scale and the Mood Evaluation Scale were used. RESULTS: The results showed that the perception of threat from COVID-19 was related positively to negative affect and emotional signs, that is, sadness-depression, anxiety and anger-hostility. There was a direct positive effect of perceived threat from COVID-19 on sadness-depression, anxiety and anger-hostility moods, while anxiety and anger-hostility had a direct positive effect on perception of threat from the virus. Thus, there was a circular relationship, in which perceived threat influenced the presence of negative mood, and negative mood, in turn, linked to emotions of irritation and agitation from a present situation, promoted the feeling of threat. CONCLUSIONS: A negative affective balance increases both one's perception of threat from COVID-19 and negative mood. Thus, knowing the emotional and cognitive effects on the population would enable measures to be put into service to facilitate their effective coping.","Pérez-Fuentes, María Del Carmen; Molero Jurado, María Del Mar; Martos Martínez, África; Gázquez Linares, Jose Jesús",PLoS One,,657
473484,NLP&IR@UNED at CheckThat! 2021: Check-worthiness estimation and fake news detection using transformer models,2021,"Clinical reports suggest that the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus-2 (CoV-2) has not only taken millions of lives, but has also created a major crisis of neurologic complications that persist even after recovery from the disease. Autopsies of patients confirm the presence of the coronaviruses in the CNS, especially in the brain. The invasion and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS is not clearly defined, but, because the endocytic pathway has become an important target for the development of therapeutic strategies for COVID-19, it is necessary to understand endocytic processes in the CNS. In addition, mitochondria and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways play a critical role in the antiviral immune response, and may also be critical for endocytic activity. Furthermore, dysfunctions of mitochondria and mTOR signaling pathways have been associated with some high-risk conditions such as diabetes and immunodeficiency for developing severe complications observed in COVID-19 patients. However, the role of these pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread are largely unknown. In this review, we discuss the potential mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the CNS and how mitochondria and mTOR pathways might regulate endocytic vesicle-mitochondria interactions and dynamics during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mechanisms that plausibly account for severe neurologic complications with COVID-19 and potential treatments with Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs targeting mitochondria and the mTOR pathways are also addressed.","Swain, Olivia; Romano, Sofia K; Miryala, Ritika; Tsai, Jocelyn; Parikh, Vinnie; Umanah, George K E",J Neurosci,,657

OBJECTIVES: To identify the association between COVID-19 and skin diseases or biologics. METHODS: A nationwide claim dataset relevant to COVID-19 in South Korea was analysed. This dataset included insurance claim data before and during COVID-19 treatment and clinical outcomes. Claim data related to skin diseases and relevant biologics were analysed to determine the association of COVID-19 with skin diseases and relevant biologics. RESULTS: The dataset contained a total of 234 427 individuals (111 947 male and 122 480 female) who underwent COVID-19 testing. Of them, 7590 (3·2%) were confirmed as having COVID-19, and 227 (3·0%) confirmed patients died. Among various skin diseases and biologics, no significant increase in the presence of specific skin diseases or exposure to biologics was observed in the COVID-19-positive group, even after adjusting for or matching covariates. The presence of skin diseases and exposure to biologics also did not seem to affect clinical outcomes including mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Underlying skin diseases did not appear to increase susceptibility to COVID-19 or mortality from COVID-19. Considering the risks and benefits, biologics for dermatological conditions might be continuously used during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cho, S I; Kim, Y E; Jo, S J",Br. j. dermatol,,657

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Citation bias was investigated by assessing the degree of agreement between evidence provided by a remdesivir randomized controlled trial and its citing articles. The dissimilarity of outcomes derived from nonrandomized and randomized studies was tested by a meta-analysis of hydroxychloroquine effects on mortality. The differential influence of studies with beneficial over those with neutral results was evaluated by a bibliometric analysis. RESULTS: The articles citing the ACTT-1 remdesivir trial preferentially presented its positive outcomes in 55.83% and its negative outcomes in 6.43% of cases. The hydroxychloroquine indicated no significant effect by randomized studies, but a significant survival benefit by nonrandomized ones. Citation mapping revealed that the study reporting survival benefit from the hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination was the most influential, despite subsequent studies reporting potential harmful effects. CONCLUSION: The present study raises concerns about citation bias and a predilection of reporting beneficial over harmful effects in the Covid-19 treatment research, potentially in the context of white hat bias. Preregistration, data sharing and avoidance of selective reporting are crucial to ensure the credibility of future research.","Bellos, Ioannis",J Clin Epidemiol,,657
479739,On the dynamical modeling of COVID-19 involving Atangana–Baleanu fractional derivative and based on Daubechies framelet simulations,2020,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Determine if antibiotic prescribing patterns differ for in-person versus virtual clinic visits for acute rhinosinusitis (ARS). STUDY DESIGN: Cross sectional study. METHODS: All adult virtual clinical encounters from March to May 2020 with a principal diagnosis of ARS were reviewed for demographic data and the presence or absence of an antibiotic prescription during the coronavirus shut down in Massachusetts. In-person clinical encounters from March to May 2019 were similarly examined as a control. The rate of antibiotic prescription was compared between virtual (2020) and in-person (2019) visits for ARS diagnoses. RESULTS: There were 2,075 patients in March to May 2020 and 3,654 patients March to May 2019 who received an ARS principal diagnosis at their virtual and in-person outpatient visits, respectively. There was a statistically significant lower rate of antibiotic prescriptions for ARS in 2020 (72.1%) versus 2019 (76.7%).The odds ratio for an antibiotic prescription for ARS was 0.783 (95% confidence interval, 0.693-0.86; P < .001) for patients seen in the 2020 cohort versus the 2019 cohort. The compared rates for antibiotic prescribing for 2020 versus 2019 were not different in individual month-to-month comparisons. When stratified by otolaryngology providers there was no statistically significant difference of antibiotic prescriptions between the 2019 and 2020 cohort (P = .781). CONCLUSIONS: During the massive transition to virtual visits for March to May 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic shut down in Massachusetts, the total rate of outpatient antibiotic prescribing for ARS was lower in the virtual visit environment compared to the traditional in-person visit. In this scenario, telemedicine did not result in an increase in antibiotic prescribing despite the lack of an in-person physical exam.

482171,A novel adaptive deep learning model of Covid-19 with focus on mortality reduction strategies,2020,"BACKGROUND: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is caused by a variety of antigens and low-molecular-weight chemicals, often through occupational exposure. Making a diagnosis of HP and identifying a cause are challenging. Cryptogenic cases are frequently reported, and missing or incomplete exposure histories can cause misclassification. AIMS: To provide an evidence-based compendium of sources of exposure and causes of HP for the clinician, through systematic review of medical literature. METHODS: Articles related to HP causative agents and occupational exposure were searched from the databases OVID Medline (1946 to October 2020) and EMBASE (1974 to October 2020). Abstracts and full texts of articles were screened by two reviewers. Data on causative antigens, occupational source of exposure and any associated eponymous name were extracted and grouped according to source of exposure. RESULTS: A total of 1790 articles were identified, from which 305 articles met the inclusion criteria. An additional 22 articles were identified from citation lists of the selected review articles. Sources of exposure identified for HP were sorted into 14 categories of work (agricultural, plant matter processing, wood, animal-related, foodstuff, food processing, metal processing, polymers, other manufacturing, chemicals, aerosolized water, service, waste and sewage and wind instruments). CONCLUSIONS: This work is a comprehensive list of occupational causative agents and exposures causing HP. Cases are grouped by source of exposure, allowing an immediately accessible compendium of causes for use during occupational exposure assessment, which could also form the basis for a clinical questionnaire.","Kongsupon, N; Walters, G I; Sadhra, S S",Occup. med,,657
482592,A preliminary analysis of AI based smartphone application for diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images,2021,"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is increasingly reported in seriously ill patients with COVID-19 infection. Incidence of VTE has been reported before and results varied widely in study cohorts. AREA OF UNCERTAINTY: Incidence of major VTE (segmental pulmonary embolism and above and proximal deep vein thrombosis) which is a contributor to mortality and morbidity is not known. Also, data is unclear on the optimal anticoagulation regimen to prevent VTE. DATA SOURCES: Multiple databases including PubMed were searched until May 12, 2020, to include studies reporting VTE in hospitalized COVID-19 adult patients. MOOSE guidelines were followed in selection, and 11 studies were included. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the VTE burden in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and potential benefits of therapeutic dosing of anticoagulation compared with prophylaxis dosing for VTE prevention. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: Many societies and experts recommend routine prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin for VTE prevention in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In this meta-analysis, the pooled rate of major VTE was 12.5% in hospitalized patients and 17.2% in intensive care unit patients. When therapeutic anticoagulation dosing was compared with prophylactic anticoagulation, the pooled odds ratio of VTE was 0.33 (95% confidence interval 0.14-0.75; P = 0.008, I = 0%) suggesting statistical significance with therapeutic dosing of anticoagulation for primary prevention of VTE in all hospitalized patients. However, this should be interpreted with caution as the bleeding events and safety profile could not be ascertained because of lack of adequate information. We recommend applying this finding to hospitalized COVID 19 patients only after carefully weighing individual bleeding risks and benefits. CONCLUSION: Major VTE events, especially pulmonary embolism, seem to be high in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Therapeutic anticoagulation dosing seems to significantly benefit the odds of preventing any VTE when compared with prophylactic dosing in all hospitalized patients.","Sridharan, Gurusaravanan Kutti; Vegunta, Radhakrishna; Rokkam, Venkata Ram Pradeep; Meyyur Aravamudan, Veeraraghavan; Vegunta, Rathnamitreyee; Khan, Shahab R; Ponnada, Suresh; Boregowda, Umesha; Prudhvi, Kalyan; Chamarthi, Gajapathiraju; Mohan, Babu P",Am J Ther,,657
483515,Image-Based Prediction of Respiratory Diseases Including COVID-19 Using Convolutional Neural Networks,2021,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to examine the impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic on diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) rates in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study of 11 Israeli pediatric emergency departments (ED) was conducted. Children with T1D who attended the ED between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 were compared with those who attended the ED between March 1, 2019 and May 31, 2019. RESULTS: Overall, 150 and 154 children with T1D attended the EDs during the 3-month study periods in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Among patients with established T1D, DKA rates significantly increased in 2020 compared to 2019 [38/64 (59.3%) vs 31/74 (41.9%); p < 0.043]. There was a non-statistically significant trend toward a higher rate of DKA in patients with newly diagnosed T1D [46/86 (53.4%) vs 31/80 (38.7%); p = 0.063]. No differences were observed in the rates of severe DKA in 2020 compared to 2019 among patients with established T1D [10/64 (15.6%) vs 6/74 (8.1%); p = 0.184], and newly diagnosed T1D [16/86 (18.6%) vs 14/80 (17.5%); p = 0.858]. No differences were observed in the rates of intensive care unit admissions in 2020 compared to 2019 among patients with established T1D [14/64 (21.8%) vs 14/74 (18.9%); p = 0.672], and newly diagnosed T1D [26/86 (30.2%) vs 21/80 (26.2%); p = 0.977]. CONCLUSIONS: Increased rates of DKA in children with established T1D were observed during the first 3 months of the outbreak in Israel. The findings suggest that the severity of DKA at ED presentation in children with T1D was not influenced by the pandemic.","Jacob, Ron; Weiser, Giora; Krupik, Danna; Takagi, Dania; Peled, Shuny; Pines, Naama; Hashavya, Saar; Gur-Soferman, Hagar; Gamsu, Shirly; Kaplan, Or; Maimon, Michal; Oren, Shahar; Padeh, Gabi; Shavit, Itai",Diabetes Ther,,657

One of the ways is by doing a cardiac rehabilitation program. Cardiac rehabilitation program is divided into three phases. The cardiac rehabilitation program's implementation, especially the second phase, center-based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR), has many barriers not to participate optimally. Therefore, the third phase, known as home-based cardiac rehabilitation (HBCR), can become a substitute or addition to CBCR. On the other hand, this phase is also an essential part of the patients' functional capacity. During the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic, HBCR has become the leading solution in the cardiac rehabilitation program's sustainability. Innovation is needed in its implementation, such as telerehabilitation. So, the cardiac rehabilitation program can be implemented by patients and monitored by health care providers continuously. SHORT CONCLUSION: Physicians play an essential role in motivating patients and encouraging their family members to commit to a sustainable CR program with telerehabilitation to facilitate its implementation.","Sari, Dian M; Wijaya, Laurentia C G",Egypt Heart J,,657

All patients were on active follow-up and lived in Lombardy, one of the most affected areas. PATIENTS: We enrolled 279 patients with primary and secondary AI and 112 controls (patients with benign pituitary lesions without hormonal alterations). All AI patients had been previously trained to modify their replacement therapy on stress doses. INTERVENTION: By administering a standardized questionnaire by phone, we collected data on COVID-19 suggestive symptoms and consequences. RESULTS: In February-April 2020, the prevalence of symptomatic patients (complaining at least one symptom of viral infection) was similar between the two groups (24% in AI and 22.3% in controls, p 0.79). Highly suggestive COVID-19 symptoms (at least two including fever and/or cough) also occurred equally in AI and controls (12.5% in both groups).

Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, several articles have suggested the potential involvement of vitamin D in reducing the risk and severity of the disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological and observational studies support the hypothesis of a protective role of vitamin D but most studies are retrospective or based on small samples. However, the pandemic progression and the increased knowledge on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 have challenged the first evidence, suggesting also potential negative consequences derived by adequate vitamin D status. A cautious interpretation of the significance of low vitamin D25OH levels is advisable. The balance between over-activation of innate immunity and the exhaustibility of the adaptive immune response still needs to be clarified. In addition, the modulation of endothelial function, the down-regulation of renin, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin genes and the up-regulation of ACE2 expression is still an area of research. SUMMARY: Speculative hypotheses and observational data have suggested a protective role of vitamin D in COVID-19. However, many unanswered questions remain, aberrant detrimental effects of adequate vitamin D25OH levels cannot be excluded and whether its adequacy may prevent the infection or improve clinical outcomes needs to be assessed by adequately sized and designed population-based studies and intervention trials.","Cereda, Emanuele; Bogliolo, Laura; de Stefano, Ludovico; Caccialanza, Riccardo",Curr. opin. clin. nutr. metab. care,,657

499814,An automatic approach based on CNN architecture to detect Covid-19 disease from chest X-ray images,2020,"Objectives: In 2019 the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 began to spread rapidly. According to the World Health Organization 25million COVID-19 cases were confirmed globally with over 850,000 deaths. To contain the pandemic Bavaria introduced alockdown in 20.03.2020. To avoid further morbidity and mortality preclinical facilities with diagnostic tools, triage protocolsand supplementary isolated intensive care units focused on corona related patients. These measures led to a reduction of medical resources for other patients. Also elective cardiac surgery (CS) and diagnosiswas delayed and reduced leading to more patients with progressive cardiac symptoms. These patients were transported ortransferred to our hospital needing urgent cardiac surgery procedure. In this study we aim to report the variation of incidences, emergency cases and cardiac symptoms after lockdown andcompare these numbers to an equal period in 2019. Methods: We compared a cohort after lockdown in 20.03-14.08.2020 with a cohort in an equal period in 2019.Classification parameters according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA), the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS),the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the history of myocardial infarction/cardiac decompensation wereobserved. Also a 30 days follow up was performed. Result: Compared with 2019, a decline of incidence in cardiac surgery procedures was observed after lockdown by-20.81% ( p &lt; 0.01). Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures went down by -51.28%, heart valve disease(HVD) went down by -4.17%, CABG + HVD increased by +10.81%, aortic -15%, and others -46.67%. Moreover, significant increases in high-level NYHA, CCS, cardiac shock, and ASA could be observed: NYHA (III from 39.08to 56.30% and IV: 5.75-7.78%), CCS (IV: 2.02-6.69%), and cardiac shock/decompensation (17.52-19.33%). Accordingly,an elevated grade of ASA indicating urgent CS was derived (IV: 37.07-51.48% and V: 1.72-8.52%). A 30-day follow-up showed no significant difference concerning overall mortality in 2019 (3.33%) versus 2020 (3.74%)-the cause of death being cardiac failure (nine cases in 2019;two cases in 2020) and multiorgan failure (two cases in 2019;five cases in 2020). Conclusion: Due to the pandemic preclinical diagnostics and therapy put a strong focus on corona related patients. Thereduction and postponement of elective cardiac procedures led to a higher number of patients with progressive cardiacsymptoms in need for urgent CS procedures.","Lee, J.

Yet people who use opioids (PWUO) continue to face a number of barriers accessing naloxone, including not knowing where it is available. METHODS: We used data from 173 PWUO from Anne Arundel County, Maryland, which is located between Baltimore City and Washington, DC. We assessed the prevalence of recently (past 6 months) receiving naloxone and currently having naloxone, the type(s) of the naloxone kits received, and the perceived ease/difficultly of accessing naloxone. We also assessed participants knowledge of where naloxone was available in the community. RESULTS: One third (35.7%) of participants had recently received naloxone. Most who had received naloxone received two doses (72.1%), nasal naloxone (86.9%), and education about naloxone use (72.1%). Most currently had naloxone in their possession (either on their person or at home; 78.7%). One third (34.4%) believed naloxone was difficult to obtain in their community. Only half (56.7%) knew of multiple locations where they could get naloxone. The health department was the most commonly identified naloxone source (58.0%). Identifying multiple sources of naloxone was associated with being more likely to perceive that naloxone is easy to access. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that additional public health efforts are needed to make PWUO aware of the range of sources of naloxone in their communities in order to ensure easy and continued naloxone access to PWUO.","Schneider, Kristin E; Urquhart, Glenna J; Rouhani, Saba; Park, Ju Nyeong; Morris, Miles; Allen, Sean T; Sherman, Susan G",Harm Reduct J,,657

Influenza studies have shown that influenza viruses survive longer on surfaces or in droplets in cold and dry air, thus increasing the likelihood of subsequent transmission. A similar hypothesis has been postulated for the transmission of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is important to propose methodologies to understand the effects of environmental factors on this ongoing outbreak to support decision-making pertaining to disease control. Here, we examine the spatial variability of the basic reproductive numbers of COVID-19 across provinces and cities in China and show that environmental variables alone cannot explain this variability. Our findings suggest that changes in weather (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the Northern Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in case counts without the implementation of drastic public health interventions.","Poirier, Canelle; Luo, Wei; Majumder, Maimuna S; Liu, Dianbo; Mandl, Kenneth D; Mooring, Todd A; Santillana, Mauricio",Sci Rep,,657

Current main-stream diagnostic methods in the laboratory include nucleic acid PCR tests and direct viral antigen tests for detecting active infections, and indirect human antibody tests specific to SARS-CoV-2 to detect prior exposure. In this Perspective, we briefly describe the PCR and antigen tests and then focus mainly on existing antibody tests and their limitations including inaccuracies and possible causes of unreliability. False negatives in antibody immunoassays can arise from assay formats, selection of viral antigens and antibody types, diagnostic testing windows, individual variance, and fluctuation in antibody levels. Reasons for false positives in antibody immunoassays mainly involve antibody cross-reactivity from other viruses, as well as autoimmune disease. The spectrum bias has an effect on both the false negatives and false positives. For assay developers, not only improvement of assay formats but also selection of viral antigens and isotopes of human antibodies need to be carefully considered to improve sensitivity and specificity. For clinicians, the factors influencing the accuracy of assays must be kept in mind to test patients using currently imperfect but available tests with smart tactics and realistic interpretation of the test results.","Liu, Guoqiang; Rusling, James F",ACS Sens,,657

504166,Mask Recognition Method Based on Graph Convolutional Network,2021,"In this paper we conduct a simulation study of the spread of an epidemic like COVID-19 with temporary immunity on finite spatial and non-spatial network models. In particular, we assume that an epidemic spreads stochastically on a scale-free network and that each infected individual in the network gains a temporary immunity after its infectious period is over. After the temporary immunity period is over, the individual becomes susceptible to the virus again. When the underlying contact network is embedded in Euclidean geometry, we model three different intervention strategies that aim to control the spread of the epidemic: social distancing, restrictions on travel, and restrictions on maximal number of social contacts per node. Our first finding is that on a finite network, a long enough average immunity period leads to extinction of the pandemic after the first peak, analogous to the concept of""herd immunity"". For each model, there is a critical average immunity length $L_c$ above which this happens. Our second finding is that all three interventions manage to flatten the first peak (the travel restrictions most efficiently), as well as decrease the critical immunity length $L_c$, but elongate the epidemic. However, when the average immunity length $L$ is shorter than $L_c$, the price for the flattened first peak is often a high second peak: for limiting the maximal number of contacts, the second peak can be as high as 1/3 of the first peak, and twice as high as it would be without intervention. Thirdly, interventions introduce oscillations into the system and the time to reach equilibrium is, for almost all scenarios, much longer. We conclude that network-based epidemic models can show a variety of behaviors that are not captured by the continuous compartmental models.","Hulshof, Tim; Jorritsma, Joost; Komj'athy, J'ulia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06880v1.pdf,657

506664,Assessing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on urban transportation and air quality in Canada,2021,"Actuality The course of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is unpredictable. It manifests in some cases as increasing inflammation to even the onset of a cytokine storm and irreversible progression of acute respiratory syndrome, which is associated with the risk of death in patients. Thus, proactive anti-inflammatory therapy remains an open serious question in patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia, who still have signs of inflammation on days 7-9 of the disease: elevated C-reactive protein (CRP)&gt;60 mg/dL and at least two of the four clinical signs: fever &gt;37.5°C; persistent cough; dyspnea (RR &gt;20 brpm) and/or reduced oxygen blood saturation &lt;94% when breathing atmospheric air. We designed the randomized trial: COLchicine versus Ruxolitinib and Secukinumab in Open-label Prospective Randomized Trial in Patients with COVID-19 (COLORIT). We present here data comparing patients who received colchicine with those who did not receive specific anti-inflammatory therapy. Results of the comparison of colchicine, ruxolitinib, and secukinumab will be presented later.Objective Compare efficacy and safety of colchicine compared to the management of patients with COVID-19 without specific anti-inflammatory therapy.Material and Methods Initially, 20 people were expected to be randomized in the control group. However, enrollment to the control group was discontinued subsequently after the inclusion of 5 patients due to the risk of severe deterioration in the absence of anti-inflammatory treatment. Therefore, 17 patients, who had not received anti-inflammatory therapy when treated in the MSU Medical Research and Educational Center before the study, were also included in the control group. The effects were assessed on day 12 after the inclusion or at discharge if it occurred earlier than on day 12. The primary endpoint was the changes in the SHOCS-COVID score, which includes the assessment of the patient's clinical condition, CT score of the lung tissue damage, the severity of systemic inflammation (CRP changes), and the risk of thrombotic complications (D-dimer) [1].Results The median SHOCS score decreased from 8 to 2 (p = 0.017), i.e., from moderate to mild degree, in the colchicine group. The change in the SHOCS-COVID score was minimal and statistically insignificant in the control group. In patients with COVID-19 treated with colchicine, the CRP levels decreased rapidly and normalized (from 99.4 to 4.2 mg/dL, p&lt;0.001). In the control group, the CRP levels decreased moderately and statistically insignificantly and achieved 22.8 mg/dL by the end of the follow-up period, which was still more than four times higher than normal. The most informative criterion for inflammation lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio (LCR) increased in the colchicine group by 393 versus 54 in the control group (p = 0.003). After treatment, it was 60.8 in the control group, which was less than 100 considered safe in terms of systemic inflammation progression. The difference from 427 in the colchicine group was highly significant (p = 0.003).The marked and rapid decrease in the inflammation factors was accompanied in the colchicine group by the reduced need for oxygen support from 14 (66.7%) to 2 (9.5%). In the control group, the number of patients without anti-inflammatory therapy requiring oxygen support remained unchanged at 50%. There was a trend to shorter hospital stays in the group of specific anti-inflammatory therapy up to 13 days compared to 17.5 days in the control group (p = 0.079). Moreover, two patients died in the control group, and there were no fatal cases in the colchicine group. In the colchicine group, one patient had deep vein thrombosis with D-dimer elevated to 5.99 µg/mL, which resolved before discharge.Conclusions Colchicine 1 mg for 1-3 days followed by 0.5 mg/day for 14 days is effective as a proactive anti-inflammatory therapy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and viral pneumonia. The management of such patients without proactive anti-inflammatory therapy is likely to be unreasonable and may worsen the course of COVID-19. However, the findings should be treated with caution, given the small size of the trial.","Mareev, V Yu; Orlova, Ya A; Plisyk, A G; Pavlikova, E P; Akopyan, Z A; Matskeplishvili, S T; Malakhov, P S; Krasnova, T N; Seredenina, E M; Potapenko, A V; Agapov, M A; Asratyan, D A; Dyachuk, L I; Samokhodskaya, L M; Mershina, Ð Ð; Sinitsyn, V E; Pakhomov, P V; Zhdanova, E A; Mareev, Yu V; Begrambekova, Yu L; Kamalov, Ð Ð",Kardiologiia,,657

The study aim was to investigate healthcare access among a group of international students studying in Ankara city and identify potential barriers that affect full healthcare utilization. METHOD: A total of 535 international students from 83 countries completed an online-based questionnaire. The survey was conducted from September until October 2020. Variables between groups within the study sample were compared using ANOVA and Chi-square tests (with Fisher's exact test). Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between variables related to access to health services. RESULTS: Of the study population, 80.6% accessed the general practitioner (GP), 40% accessed the student health centres, and 11.4% were admitted to the hospital at least once. About 80% of international students reported changing their views to access healthcare more because of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Lack of awareness of healthcare support systems, perceived stigma associated with mental health services, and language barriers were the main barriers affecting healthcare access by international students. IMPLICATIONS: Study findings indicate the need for education of international students on available healthcare, targeted health promotion, and training of health providers on effective communication.","Masai, Abednego Nzyuko; Güçiz-Dogan, Bahar; Ouma, Polet Njeri; Nyadera, Israel Nyaburi; Ruto, Victor Kipkoech",BMC Health Serv Res,,657

511201,Evaluating Deep Learning Approaches for Covid19 Fake News Detection,2021,"Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, 10 severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 × 109/L vs. 0.76 × 109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.","Duan, Kai; Liu, Bende; Li, Cesheng; Zhang, Huajun; Yu, Ting; Qu, Jieming; Zhou, Min; Chen, Li; Meng, Shengli; Hu, Yong; Peng, Cheng; Yuan, Mingchao; Huang, Jinyan; Wang, Zejun; Yu, Jianhong; Gao, Xiaoxiao; Wang, Dan; Yu, Xiaoqi; Li, Li; Zhang, Jiayou; Wu, Xiao; Li, Bei; Xu, Yanping; Chen, Wei; Peng, Yan; Hu, Yeqin; Lin, Lianzhen; Liu, Xuefei; Huang, Shihe; Zhou, Zhijun; Zhang, Lianghao; Wang, Yue; Zhang, Zhi; Deng, Kun; Xia, Zhiwu; Gong, Qin; Zhang, Wei; Zheng, Xiaobei; Liu, Ying; Yang, Huichuan; Zhou, Dongbo; Yu, Ding; Hou, Jifeng; Shi, Zhengli; Chen, Saijuan; Chen, Zhu; Zhang, Xinxin; Yang, Xiaoming",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,657

511471,Indivior-sponsored event focuses on opioids during COVID-19,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread globally despite the worldwide implementation of preventive measures to combat the disease. Although most COVID-19 cases are characterised by a mild, self-limiting disease course, a considerable subset of patients develop a more severe condition, varying from pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to multi-organ failure (MOF). Progression of COVID-19 is thought to occur as a result of a complex interplay between multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, all of which may orchestrate SARS-CoV-2 infection and contribute to organ-specific tissue damage. In this respect, dissecting currently available knowledge of COVID-19 immunopathogenesis is crucially important, not only to improve our understanding of its pathophysiology but also to fuel the rationale of both novel and repurposed treatment modalities. Various immune-mediated pathways during SARS-CoV-2 infection are relevant in this context, which relate to innate immunity, adaptive immunity, and autoimmunity. Pathological findings in tissue specimens of patients with COVID-19 provide valuable information with regard to our understanding of pathophysiology as well as the development of evidence-based treatment regimens. This review provides an updated overview of the main pathological changes observed in COVID-19 within the most commonly affected organ systems, with special emphasis on immunopathology. Current management strategies for COVID-19 include supportive care and the use of repurposed or symptomatic drugs, such as dexamethasone, remdesivir, and anticoagulants. Ultimately, prevention is key to combat COVID-19, and this requires appropriate measures to attenuate its spread and, above all, the development and implementation of effective vaccines. © 2021 The Authors.

Unsupervised time series clustering over symptom presentation was performed on data collected from a training dataset of completed cases enlisted early from the COVID Symptom Study Smartphone application, yielding six distinct symptom presentations. Clustering was validated on an independent replication dataset between 1 and 28 May 2020. Using the first 5 days of symptom logging, the ROC-AUC (receiver operating characteristic - area under the curve) of need for respiratory support was 78.8%, substantially outperforming personal characteristics alone (ROC-AUC 69.5%).

512893,Pneumonia Detection on Chest X-ray using Radiomic Features and Contrastive Learning,2021-01-12,"Understanding of the evolved biological function of NREM and slow wave sleep has advanced considerably in the past decade. However, no equivalent understanding of REM sleep and dreams has emerged. Contemporary neuroscientific theories generally view dreams as epiphenomena, and the few proposals for their biological function are contradicted by the phenomenology of dreams themselves. Now, the recent advent of deep neural networks (DNNs) has finally provided the novel conceptual framework within which to understand the evolved function of dreams. Notably, all DNNs face the issue of overfitting as they learn, which is when performance on one data set increases but the network's performance fails to generalize (often measured by the divergence of performance on training vs testing data sets). This ubiquitous problem in DNNs is often solved by experimenters via""noise injections""in the form of noisy or corrupted inputs. The goal of this paper is to argue that the brain faces a similar challenge of overfitting, and that nightly dreams evolved to combat the brain's overfitting during its daily learning. That is, dreams are a biological mechanism for increasing generalizability. Sleep loss, specifically dream loss, leads to an overfitted brain that can still memorize and learn but fails to generalize appropriately. Herein this""overfitted brain hypothesis""is explicitly developed and then compared and contrasted with existing contemporary neuroscientific theories of dreams. Existing evidence for the hypothesis is surveyed within both neuroscience and deep learning, and a set of testable predictions are put forward that can be pursued both in vivo and in silico.","Hoel, Erik",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09560v1.pdf,657

Here we report on a beneficial impact of a passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma to treat a prolonged, active COVID-19 infection in a patient with a history of nasopharyngeal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with the therapy inducing substantial impairment of particularly humoral arm of immune system. The specific aim was to quantify SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies in a patient plasma during the course of therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Besides the standard of care treatment and monitoring, neutralizing antibody titers in patient's serum samples, calibrated according to the First WHO International Standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (human), were quantified in a time-dependent manner. During the immunotherapy period peripheral blood flow cytometry immunophenotyping was conducted to characterize lymphocyte subpopulations. RESULTS: The waves of clinical improvements and worsening coincided with transfused neutralizing antibodies rises and drops in the patient's systemic circulation, proving their contribution in controlling the disease progress. Besides the patient's lack of own humoral immune system, immunophenotyping analysis revealed also the reduced level of helper T-lymphocytes and immune exhaustion of monocytes.

Hemodialysis patients constitute a large group of at-risk patients that not only suffer from a compromised immune system but also are at a higher risk due to frequent admission to healthcare units. Therefore, a better understanding on the pathogenesis and possible risk factors of COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients is of high importance. METHODS: A total of 670 maintained hemodialysis patients from all dialysis units of the East Azerbaijan Province of Iran, including 44 COVID-19 patients were included in the present study. Possible associations between the backgrounds of patients and the incidence of COVID-19 were assessed. Also, hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 were compared to 211 nonhemodialysis COVID-19 patients. FINDINGS: Chronic glomerulonephritis patients and those with blood group A demonstrated a higher incidence of COVID-19. On the other hand, patients with blood group AB+ and those with hypertension etiology of kidney failure demonstrated a lower incidence of COVID-19. Hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 had higher counts of polymorphonuclears (PMNs) in their peripheral blood compared to other COVID-19 patients. DISCUSSION: A better comprehension on the risk factors associated with COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients can improve our understanding on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in different situations and help the enhancement of current therapeutics for COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients.","Tayebi Khosroshahi, Hamid; Mardomi, Alireza; Niknafs, Bahram; Farnood, Farahnoosh; Shekarchi, Mohsen; Salehi, Shabnam; Fadaei Haggi, Taghi",Hemodial. int,,657

In addition, the effect of nasal strip on the prevention of discomfort in breathing with mask was also investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was carried out with 48 HCWs (Control Group-CG, n = 20; Experimental Group 1-EG1, n = 20; Experimental Group 2-EG2, n = 8) who use PPE on the face region and work with COVID-19 patients. Data was collected with Data Collection Form developed by researchers. In participants in CG, normal procedures of the institution in using PPE were followed. In EG1, prophylactic dressing was used on risky areas on the face. In EG2, nasal strip sticky on one side was used in addition to prophylactic dressing. The evaluation of the facial skin was made once a day by a researcher with expertise in wound management. RESULTS: Groups were similar in terms of demographic characteristics of participants. Overall rate of skin injuries associated with PPE use was 47.9%. Skin injuries developed in all participants in CG (n = 20), and in two and one participants in EG1 and EG2 respectively, with significant difference between groups. The most common skin injuries were Stage 1 pressure injury (29.2%), blanchable erythema of intact skin (27.1%) and itching (18.8%). No participant in EG2 reported discomfort in breathing (n = 8). Significant difference was found between groups in favor of EG2 in terms of experiencing discomfort in breathing (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, it was established that using prophylactic dressing under PPE prevents skin injuries on the facial skin and using nasal strip prevents discomfort in breathing with mask. In view of these results, it was recommended that prophylactic dressing should be used under PPE.","Yildiz, Aybala; Karadag, Ayise; Yildiz, Alp; Çakar, Vildan",,,657

Within this theme, research has been published highlighting the importance of learner agency in the assessment and feedback process as a way to develop assessment literacy in contrast with the existing lecturer-led approach. In this research, we aimed to find out whether lecturers are willing to let go of some of the power they currently have in the digital assessment and feedback process and how they see opportunities for agency being developed in the digital assessment and feedback systems. We collected data from 10 sandpits with 58 lecturers in which, using a storytelling technique and one mock-up of a digital assessment and feedback system, we discussed and critiqued an assessment scenario intending to collect perceptions about digital assessment and feedback and the constraints felt by lecturers in their assessment practice.

591900,Classification of COVID-19 Chest CT Images Based on Ensemble Deep Learning,2021-04-20,"IMPORTANCE: Digital contact tracing (DCT) apps have been released in several countries to help interrupt SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains. However, the effect of DCT on pandemic mitigation remains to be demonstrated. OBJECTIVE: To estimate key populations and performance indicators along the exposure notification cascade of the SwissCovid DCT app in a clearly defined regional and temporal context. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study was based on a simulation informed by measured data from issued quarantine recommendations and positive SARS-CoV-2 test results after DCT exposure notifications in the canton of Zurich. A stochastic model was developed to re-create the DCT notification cascade for Zurich. Population sizes at each cascade step were estimated using triangulation based on publicly available administrative and observational research data for the study duration from September 1 to October 31, 2020. The resultant estimates were checked for internal consistency and consistency with upstream or downstream estimates in the cascade. Stochastic sampling from data-informed parameter distributions was performed to explore the robustness of results. Subsequently, key performance indicators were evaluated to assess the potential contribution of DCT compared with manual contact tracing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Receiving a voluntary quarantine recommendation and/or a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result after exposure notification. RESULTS: In September 2020, 537 app users received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result in Zurich, 324 of whom received and entered an upload authorization code. This code triggered an app notification for an estimated 1374 (95% simulation interval [SI], 932-2586) proximity contacts and led to 722 information hotline calls, with an estimated 170 callers (95% SI, 154-186) receiving a quarantine recommendation. An estimated 939 (95% SI, 720-1127) notified app users underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 30 (95% SI, 23-36) had positive results after an app notification. Key indicator evaluations revealed that the DCT app triggered quarantine recommendations for the equivalent of 5% of all exposed contacts placed in quarantine by manual contact tracing. For every 10.9 (95% SI, 7.6-15.6) upload authorization codes entered in the app, 1 contact had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 after app notification. Longitudinal indicator analyses demonstrated bottlenecks in the notification cascade, because capacity limits were reached owing to an increased incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in October 2020. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this simulation study of the notification cascade of the SwissCovid DCT app, receipt of exposure notifications was associated with quarantine recommendations and identification of SARS-CoV-2–positive cases. These findings in notified proximity contacts reflect important intermediary steps toward transmission prevention.","Menges, Dominik; Aschmann, Hélène E.; Moser, André; Althaus, Christian L.; von Wyl, Viktor",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33929521/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.8184,657

Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) are representative receptors in the cytoplasm for the detection of viral RNA and trigger antiviral responses, leading to the production of type I interferon. Although MDA5 is a crucial receptor for sensing picornavirus RNA, the interplay between MDA5 and FMDV is relatively unknown compared to the interplay between RIG-I and FMDV. Here, we observed that the FMDV infection inhibits MDA5 protein expression. Of the non-structural proteins, the Lb and 3C proteinases (Lb(pro) and 3C(pro)) were identified to be primarily responsible for this inhibition. However, the inhibition by 3C(pro) was independent of proteasome, lysosome and caspase-dependent pathway and was by 3C protease activity. A direct interaction between 3C(pro) and MDA5 protein was observed. In conclusion, this is the first report that 3C(pro) inhibits MDA5 protein expression as a mechanism to evade the innate immune response during FMDV infection. These results elucidate the pathogenesis of FMDV and provide fundamental insights for the development of a novel vaccine or therapeutic agent.","Kim, Hyejin; Kim, Ah-Young; Choi, Jieun; Park, Sun Young; Park, Sang Hyun; Kim, Jae-Seok; Lee, Sim-In; Park, Jong-Hyeon; Park, Choi-Kyu; Ko, Young-Joon",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10020271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33572945/,657

Our primary aim was to assess the effect of a blended Inquiry-Based Stress Reduction (IBSR), an emerging mindfulness and cognitive reframing intervention on teacher’s well-being. Our secondary aims were to assess the effect of IBSR on resilience, burnout, mindfulness, and stress among teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The study was a prospective controlled trial with an intervention group (N = 35) and a comparison control group (N = 32). The intervention took place in the Jerusalem District throughout the school year from November 2019 to May 2020. The sessions were conducted in blended learning that included traditional learning (face-to-face) and online learning. Data was analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Results: IBSR blended intervention enhanced the resilience and improved the subjective and psychological well-being of teachers in spite of the breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic and the first lockdown in Israel. Simultaneously the control group suffered from enhanced burnout levels and a decline in psychological and subjective well-being. Conclusions: Implementation of IBSR blended intervention during the school year may benefit teachers’ well-being and ability to flourish, even during stressful events such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zadok-Gurman, Tzofnat; Jakobovich, Ronit; Dvash, Eti; Zafrani, Keren; Rolnik, Benjamin; Ganz, Ariel B.; Lev-Ari, Shahar",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33916258/,657

We aimed to quantify the number and temporal trends of out-of-state introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Washington. Methods: We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of 11,422 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID sampled between December 2019 and September 2020. We used maximum parsimony ancestral state reconstruction methods on time-calibrated phylogenies to enumerate introductions/exports, their likely geographic source (e.g. US, non-US, and between eastern and western Washington), and estimated date of introduction. To incorporate phylogenetic uncertainty into our estimates, we conducted 5,000 replicate analyses by generating 25 random time-stratified samples of non-Washington reference sequences, 20 random polytomy resolutions, and 10 random resolutions of the reconstructed ancestral state. Results: We estimated a minimum 287 separate introductions (median, range 244-320) into Washington and 204 exported lineages (range 188-227) of SARS-CoV-2 out of Washington. Introductions began in mid-January and peaked on March 29, 2020. Lineages with the Spike D614G variant accounted for the majority (88%) of introductions. Overall, 61% (range 55-65%) of introductions into Washington likely originated from a source elsewhere within the US, while the remaining 39% (range 35-45%) likely originated from outside of the US. Intra-state transmission accounted for 65% and 28% of introductions into eastern and western Washington, respectively. Conclusions: There is phylogenetic evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Washington is continually seeded by a large number of introductions, and that there was significant inter- and intra-state transmission. Due to incomplete sampling our data underestimate the true number of introductions.","Tordoff, D. M.; Greninger, A. L.; Roychoudhury, P.; Shrestha, L.; Xie, H.; Jerome, K.

However, the detailed clinical course of organizing pneumonia (OP) caused by COVID-19 has not been clarified. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 60-year-old man and a 61-year-old woman diagnosed with mild COVID-19 were admitted to our hospital. Their respiratory symptoms were deteriorating even after initiating treatment with antiviral drugs. DIAGNOSIS: Chest X-rays and computed tomography scan showed a rapid progression of linear consolidation with reversed halo sign, distributed in subpleural and peri-bronchial regions. They also presented with pulmonary fibrosis findings, including traction bronchiectasis and marked lung volume reduction. They were diagnosed with rapidly progressing OP. INTERVENTIONS: They were treated with systemic corticosteroids. OUTCOMES: The patients’ imaging findings and respiratory conditions improved rapidly without any adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Physicians should carefully monitor patients with COVID-19, as they can develop rapidly progressive and fibrotic OP, which respond to corticosteroids.","Okamori, Satoshi; Lee, Ho; Kondo, Yasushi; Akiyama, Yuto; Kabata, Hiroki; Kaneko, Yuko; Ishii, Makoto; Hasegawa, Naoki; Fukunaga, Koichi",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000021804; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32871900/,657

The dissemination of inaccurate information and the need for social isolation to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have shown a negative impact on the population, causing damage to mental health, with the appearance or worsening of symptoms of stress, fear, anxiety, and depression. Thus, the systematic review study is intended to gather evidence on the impact of information about COVID-19 on the mental health of the population. METHODS: This systematic review protocol is conducted using the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses protocols and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The review aims to include published studies that address the exposure of the general population to information about COVID-19, through observational and experimental studies, which consider the following outcomes: fear, stress, anxiety, and depression. Thus, a comprehensive research strategy will be conducted in the following databases: PubMed / Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, Science Direct, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Two independent reviewers will perform all procedures, such as study selection, data collection, and methodological evaluation. Disagreements will be forwarded to a third reviewer.

We identified 14 proteins that were predicted to interact with host RNAs or RNA binding proteins, based on published data for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Here, we describe a series of affinity-tagged and codon-optimized expression constructs for each of these 14 proteins. Each viral gene was separately tagged at the N-terminus with Flag-His8, the C-terminus with His8-Flag, or left untagged. The resulting constructs were stably integrated into the HEK293 Flp-In TREx genome. Each viral gene was expressed under the control of an inducible Tet-On promoter, allowing expression levels to be tuned to match physiological conditions during infection. Expression time courses were successfully generated for most of the fusion proteins and quantified by western blot. A few fusion proteins were poorly expressed, whereas others, including Nsp1, Nsp12, and N protein, were toxic unless care was taken to minimize background expression. All plasmids can be obtained from Addgene and cell lines are available.

We developed three different protein arrays to measure hallmark IgG autoantibodies associated with Connective Tissue Diseases (CTDs), Anti-Cytokine Antibodies (ACA), and anti-viral antibody responses in 147 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in three different centers. Autoantibodies were identified in approximately 50% of patients, but in <15% of healthy controls. When present, autoantibodies largely targeted autoantigens associated with rare disorders such as myositis, systemic sclerosis and CTD overlap syndromes. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were observed in ~25% of patients. Patients with autoantibodies tended to demonstrate one or a few specificities whereas ACA were even more prevalent, and patients often had antibodies to multiple cytokines. Rare patients were identified with IgG antibodies against angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). A subset of autoantibodies and ACA developed de novo following SARS-CoV-2 infection while others were transient. Autoantibodies tracked with longitudinal development of IgG antibodies that recognized SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins such as S1, S2, M, N and a subset of non-structural proteins, but not proteins from influenza, seasonal coronaviruses or other pathogenic viruses. COVID-19 patients with one or more autoantibodies tended to have higher levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Nonstructural Protein 1 (NSP1) and Methyltransferase (ME). We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 causes development of new-onset IgG autoantibodies in a significant proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and are positively correlated with immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteins.","Chang, S.

Among these, an association between atrial fibrillation (AF) and COVID-19 has been described; however, the extent of this relationship is unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the epidemiology of AF in COVID-19 patients and its impact on all-cause mortality. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed and reported according to PRISMA guidelines, and a protocol for this study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021227950). PubMed and EMBASE were systematically searched for relevant studies. A random-effects model was used to estimate pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Overall, 31 studies were included in the analysis, with a total number of 187,716 COVID-19 patients. The prevalence of AF was found to be as high as 8% of patients with COVID-19 (95% CI: 6.3–10.2%, 95% prediction intervals (PI): 2.0–27.1%), with a high degree of heterogeneity between studies; a multiple meta-regression model including geographical location, age, hypertension, and diabetes showed that these factors accounted for more than a third of the heterogeneity. AF COVID-19 patients were less likely to be female but more likely older, hypertensive, and with a critical status than those without AF. Patients with AF showed a significant increase in the risk of all-cause mortality (OR: 3.97, 95% CI: 2.76–5.71), with a high degree of heterogeneity. A sensitivity analysis focusing on new-onset AF showed the consistency of these results. Conclusions: Among COVID-19 patients, AF is found in 8% of patients. AF COVID-19 patients are older, more hypertensive, and more likely to have a critical status. In COVID-19 patients, AF is associated with a 4-fold higher risk of death. Further studies are needed to define the best treatment strategies to improve the prognosis of AF COVID-19 patients.","Romiti, Giulio Francesco; Corica, Bernadette; Lip, Gregory Y.

METHODS: We obtained data of confirmed and negative COVID-19 cases and their demographic and health characteristics from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of Mexican Ministry of Health. We investigated specific risk factors associated to COVID-19 positivity and mortality and explored the impact of diabetes and obesity on modifying COVID-19 related lethality. Finally, we built a clinical score to predict COVID-19 lethality. RESULTS: Among 177,133 subjects at May 18(th), 2020, we observed 51,633 subjects with SARS-CoV-2 and 5,332 deaths. Risk factors for lethality in COVID-19 include early-onset diabetes, obesity, COPD, advanced age, hypertension, immunosuppression, and CKD; we observed that obesity mediates 49.5% of the effect of diabetes on COVID-19 lethality. Early-onset diabetes conferred an increased risk of hospitalization and obesity conferred an increased risk for ICU admission and intubation. Our predictive score for COVID-19 lethality included age ≥65 years, diabetes, early-onset diabetes, obesity, age <40 years, CKD, hypertension, and immunosuppression and significantly discriminates lethal from non-lethal COVID-19 cases (c-statistic=0.823).

However, the mechanism of NG‐induced enhanced HIV‐1 transmission is unknown. METHODS: (a) The cervical tissues were exposed to NG, and cytokine induction was monitored by measuring cytokine proteins in culture supernatants and cytokine mRNAs in tissues. (b) Transcription and replication of HIV‐1 in TZM‐bl, U1, and ACH2 cells were measured by Beta‐Gal activity and p24 proteins in the supernatant, respectively. (c) HIV‐1 transmission was assayed in an organ culture system by measuring transmitted HIV‐1 in supernatant and HIV‐1 gag mRNA in the tissues. (d) Transcriptome analysis was done using second generation sequencing. RESULTS: (a) NG induced membrane ruffling of epithelial layer, caused migration of CD3+ cells to the intraepithelial region, and induced high levels of inflammatory cytokines IL‐1β and TNF‐α. (b) NG‐induced supernatants (NGIS) increased HIV‐1 transcription, induced HIV‐1 from latently infected cells, and increased transmission of HIV‐1 across cervical mucosa. (c) Transcriptome analysis of the epithelial layer of the tissues exposed to NG, and HIV‐1 showed significant upregulation of CXCL10 and IL8. IL‐1β increased the induction of CXCL10 and IL‐8 expression in cervical mucosa with a concomitant increase in HIV‐1 transmission. CONCLUSION: We present a model in which IL‐1β produced from cervical epithelium during NG exposure increases CXCL10 and IL8 in epithelia. This in turn causes upon HIV‐1 infection, the migration of HIV‐1 target cells toward the subepithelium, resulting in increased HIV‐1 transcription in the sub‐mucosa and subsequent enhancement of transmission across cervical mucosa.","Sanyal, Anwesha; Shen, Chengli; Ding, Ming; Reinhart, Todd A.; Chen, Yue; Sankapal, Soni; Gupta, Phalguni",Am J Reprod Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1111/aji.13111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30903720/,657

Restricted access, and in many cases closure of barns, resulted in a multitude of questions and concerns within the equine community which needed to be addressed rapidly. Extension Horses, Inc. (EH) coordinated the development and delivery of a variety of educational resources utilizing a combination of online formats and dissemination through social media and EH member contact lists. A series of infographics, webinars, and podcasts (three in each category) were created to provide guidance on essential care of horses, emergency preparedness, financial assistance, legal concerns, and biosecurity during the crucial, initial weeks of the pandemic (March-April, 2020). Web conferencing technology (Zoom) was used to facilitate discussion and task delegation among EH members and to conduct and record webinars and podcasts. Podcasts were hosted on Buzzsprout and infographics were created using Adobe InDesign. Live webinar participants were invited to participate in several polls during the webinar and were sent a brief survey to complete at the end of the webinar series. Analytics for all educational resources combined demonstrated a 32-day total direct reach of 135,563. Most live webinar participants identified themselves as horse owners and small equine business owners (55%). The majority of live webinar participants indicated the information was useful (99%), and they would utilize the resources they had learned about (80%). Survey respondents said that Facebook, email, and word of mouth were key ways in which they learned about the webinars. The same survey found that the web-platform was an effective method to receive information (85% high satisfaction) and respondents were highly likely to recommend future EH webinars to others (88%). The three infographics had a total Facebook reach of 131,765, the webinars had 3,522 total views, and the three podcasts had 276 total downloads. The rapid response of EH and quick turnaround of products allowed a large online audience to receive vital information for coping with COVID-19. Having the established EH network, already familiar with virtual education, was a big asset in this effort.

625353,"Deep Learning in Classification of Covid-19 Coronavirus, Pneumonia and Healthy Lungs on CXR and CT Images",2021-06-10,"Standards for the fatigue testing of wearable sensing technologies are lacking. The majority of published fatigue tests for wearable sensors are performed on proof-of-concept stretch sensors fabricated from a variety of materials. Due to their flexibility and stretchability, polymers are often used in the fabrication of wearable sensors. Other materials, including textiles, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and conductive metals or inks, may be used in conjunction with polymers to fabricate wearable sensors. Depending on the combination of the materials used, the fatigue behaviors of wearable sensors can vary. Additionally, fatigue testing methodologies for the sensors also vary, with most tests focusing only on the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) regime, and few sensors are cycled until failure or runout are achieved. Fatigue life predictions of wearable sensors are also lacking. These issues make direct comparisons of wearable sensors difficult. To facilitate direct comparisons of wearable sensors and to move proof-of-concept sensors from “bench to bedside”, fatigue testing standards should be established. Further, both high-cycle fatigue (HCF) and failure data are needed to determine the appropriateness in the use, modification, development, and validation of fatigue life prediction models and to further the understanding of how cracks initiate and propagate in wearable sensing technologies.","Persons, Andrea Karen; Ball, John E.; Freeman, Charles; Macias, David M.; Simpson, Chartrisa LaShan; Smith, Brian K.; Burch V., Reuben F.",Materials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34361264/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ma14154070,657
627274,A Novel CFD Analysis to Minimize the Spread of COVID-19 Virus in Hospital Isolation Room,2020-09-17,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and effects of current smoking on adverse outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature (PubMed) identified 18 (from a total of 1398) relevant studies. Pooled current smoking prevalence was compared with the gender-adjusted and gender and age-adjusted, population-based expected prevalence by calculating prevalence odds ratio (POR). The association between current, compared with non-current and former, smoking and adverse outcome was examined. A secondary analysis was performed by including 12 pre-publications (30 studies in total). All analyses were performed using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Among 6515 patients, the pooled prevalence of current smoking was 6.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.8–9.1%]. The gender-adjusted POR was 0.20 (95% CI: 0.16–0.25, p < 0.001), and the gender and age-adjusted POR was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.19–0.30, p < 0.001). Current smokers were more likely to have an adverse outcome compared with non-current smokers [odds ratio (OR): 1.53, 95%CI: 1.06–2.20, p = 0.022] but less likely compared with former smokers (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.27–0.74, p = 0.003). When pre-publications were added (n = 10,631), the gender-adjusted POR was 0.27 (95% CI: 0.19–0.38, p < 0.001) and the gender and age-adjusted POR was 0.34 (95% CI: 0.24–0.48, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis of retrospective observational case series found an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Hospitalized current smokers had higher odds compared with non-current smokers but lower odds compared with former smokers for an adverse outcome. Smoking cannot be considered a protective measure for COVID-19. However, the hypothesis that nicotine may have a protective effect in COVID-19 that is partially masked by smoking-related toxicity and by the abrupt cessation of nicotine intake when smokers are hospitalized should be explored in laboratory studies and clinical trials using pharmaceutical nicotine products.","Farsalinos, Konstantinos; Barbouni, Anastasia; Poulas, Konstantinos; Polosa, Riccardo; Caponnetto, Pasquale; Niaura, Raymond",Ther Adv Chronic Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32637059/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2040622320935765,657

This study sought to investigate the content shared through FOAMed during the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Tweets containing the #FOAMed hashtag posted during a 24-hour period in April 2020 were studied. Included tweets were analysed using the Wiig knowledge management cycle framework (building knowledge, holding knowledge, pooling knowledge and using knowledge). RESULTS: 1379 tweets contained the #FOAMed hashtag, of which 265 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Included tweets were posted from 208 distinct users, originated from each world continent and were in five different languages. Three overarching themes were identified: (1) signposting and appraising evidence and guidelines; (2) sharing specialist and technical advice; and (3) personal and social engagement. Among 12 subthemes within these groupings, 11 aligned to one of the four dimensions of the Wiig knowledge management cycle framework, and the other focused on building and managing social networks. Almost 40% of tweets related directly to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: #FOAMed tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic included a broad range of resources, advice and support.

One widely reported result of the pandemic response is that travel restrictions have resulted in improvements in regional air quality. This study aims to determine the effect of COVID-19 related Stay at Home precautions on air quality in a metropolitan area. We specifically focus on CO, NO(2), and PM(10) in Maricopa County (Phoenix), Arizona, as these all contribute to local air quality concerns. The role of meteorological parameters on ambient concentrations for these pollutants was investigated by using the local planetary boundary layer height (PBH) to account for vertical mixing. Across all three sites studied, there was no uniform decrease in either CO or NO(2), even when freeway traffic volume was down by ~35%. For PM(10), there was a significant decrease of ~45% seen at all the sites for the period most directly impacted by local Stay at Home restrictions compared to the past two years. This indicates that different pollutants have fundamentally different behavior in the local environment and suggests that these pollutants originate from different sources.","Miech, Jason A.; Herckes, Pierre; Fraser, Matthew P.",Atmos Environ X,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590162121000058; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aeaoa.2021.100105; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590162121000058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33778482/,657

The purpose of this examination was to investigate whether PA, ST, and HRQoL before COVID-19 predict PA, ST, and HRQoL during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants from the Motorik-Modul Study (MoMo; N = 1711; M(age) = 10.36 (SD = 4.04) years, female = 49.8%; healthy weight = 76.8%) self-reported their PA and ST as well as HRQoL both before and during COVID-19. Relationships of all variables, from before to during COVID-19, were investigated through a path prediction model. Results showed all variables during COVID-19 were predicted by the respective levels before COVID-19, independent of gender and age. Cross-lags revealed a negative influence of before COVID-19 ST on during COVID-19 PA. HRQoL before COVID-19 was positively associated with during COVID-19 PA in children younger than 10 years and females, but not in adolescents and boys. As age- and gender-independent negative influence of before COVID-19 ST on during COVID-19 PA has been detected, health policy may be advised to focus on a general reduction in ST instead of PA enhancement to ensure high PA levels.","Wunsch, Kathrin; Nigg, Carina; Niessner, Claudia; Schmidt, Steffen C.

We use a time-varying Granger causality framework over the January 2008-November 2019 period to analyze the predictive power of uncertainties on capital flows in the form of bond and equity. The results show that the effects are heterogeneous across countries and stronger during the Global Financial Crisis period and post-2018 period while it lost its significance in the subsequent period. The negative influence of uncertainties on capital flows directed to BRICS countries is also evident in the results of non-parametric time-varying panel models. Overall, it is thought that the heterogeneous structure of the causality between uncertainty and portfolio flows into BRICS may present portfolio diversification benefits for global investors.","Çepni, Oğuzhan; Gül, Selçuk; Hacıhasanoğlu, Yavuz Selim; Yılmaz, Muhammed Hasan",Research in international business and finance,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173401/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0275531920301501?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0275531920301501; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ribaf.2020.101277,657

However, it has been challenging to reach a balance between these two ethical theories. When there is a conflict between these two ethical principles in the medical context, the conflict must be addressed in order to reach an appropriate solution for patients and others involved. To demonstrate decisions made in terms of deontological ethics and utilitarian ethics, the study will use the film Outbreak as example to further understand these two ethics in relation to epidemiology and public health. The paper will also analyze film scenarios to examine how deontological ethics and utilitarian ethics are involved and strike a balance with different pearspectives to reach an appropriate public health solution. To reach more just solutions, it is essential to determine how to make wise decisions by balancing deontological ethics and utilitarian ethics. However, the decision-making process is complicated because any solution must consider not only medical ethics but also political, environmental, and military issues. In order to reach an appropriate public health decision, those involved should be inclined toward empathy and contemplate things from different ethical perspectives to deal with ethical/moral dilemmas and create greater beneficence and justice for patients and humanity at large.","Tseng, Po-En; Wang, Ya-Huei",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444311/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168565,657

Methods We retrospectively analyzed data on patients with COVID-19 hospitalized between February and April 2020 in an outbreak hospital in North-East Italy. Pre-existing diabetes was defined by self-reported history, electronic medical records, or ongoing medications. Newly-diagnosed diabetes was defined by HbA1c and fasting glucose. The primary outcome was a composite of ICU admission or death. Results 413 subjects were included, 107 of whom (25.6%) had diabetes, including 21 newly-diagnosed. Patients with diabetes were older and had greater comorbidity burden. The primary outcome occurred in 37.4% of patients with diabetes compared to 20.3% in those without (RR 1.85; 95%C.I. 1.33-2.57; p<0.001). The association was stronger for newly-diagnosed compared to pre-existing diabetes (RR 3.06 vs 1.55; p=0.004). Higher glucose level at admission was associated with COVID-19 severity, with a stronger association among patients without as compared to those with pre-existing diabetes (interaction p<0.001). Admission glucose was correlated with most clinical severity indexes and its association with adverse outcome was mostly mediated by a worse respiratory function. Conclusion Newly-diagnosed diabetes and admission hyperglycemia are powerful predictors of COVID-19 severity due to rapid respiratory deterioration.","Paolo Fadini, Gian; Luca Morieri, Mario; Boscari, Federico; Fioretto, Paola; Maran, Alberto; Busetto, Luca; Maria Bonora, Benedetta; Selmin, Elisa; Arcidiacono, Gaetano; Pinelli, Silvia; Farnia, Filippo; Falaguasta, Daniele; Russo, Lucia; Voltan, Giacomo; Mazzocut, Sara; Costantini, Giorgia; Ghirardini, Francesca; Tresso, Silvia; Maria Cattelan, Anna; Vianello, Andrea; Avogaro, Angelo; Vettor, Roberto",Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168822720306276; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108374; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168822720306276?v=s5; http://www.diabetesresearchclinicalpractice.com/article/S0168822720306276/pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32805345/,657

International agreements such as TRIPs and free trade agreements are enhancing the level of international control on IP. This is changing deeply the R&D environment in developing economies by restraining illegal channels of knowledge accumulation such as imitation, reverse engineering and piracy. An asymmetric and non-cooperative two-stage (R&D-Production) game is proposed to model a developing market where two local firms compete with a more innovative foreign firm. Equilibrium R&D expenditures and profits of the competing firms are compared for different levels of: market technology, technological gaps and IP protection. The proposed model shows clearly that a stringent enforcement of IP agreements will dramatically decrease the innovative abilities of developing economies especially in high technological sectors. The maintain and increase of their R&D skills will not be possible without a reduction of their technological gap and strong incentives to initiate regulatory (or permit tacit) R&D cooperation between local firms.","El-Aroui, Mhamed-Ali; Dellagi, Selma; Abdelaziz, Fouad Ben",J Quant Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34248305/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40953-021-00243-1,657

Currently, detailed pathologic examination of kidney damage in critically ill patients with COVID-19 has been lacking. To help define this we analyzed kidney abnormalities in 26 autopsies of patients with COVID-19 by light microscopy, ultrastructural observation and immunostaining. Patients were on average 69 years (19 male and 7 female) with respiratory failure associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome as the cause of death. Nine of the 26 showed clinical signs of kidney injury that included increased serum creatinine and/or new-onset proteinuria. By light microscopy, diffuse proximal tubule injury with the loss of brush border, non-isometric vacuolar degeneration, and even frank necrosis was observed. Occasional hemosiderin granules and pigmented casts were identified. There were prominent erythrocyte aggregates obstructing the lumen of capillaries without platelet or fibrinoid material. Evidence of vasculitis, interstitial inflammation or hemorrhage was absent. Electron microscopic examination showed clusters of coronavirus particles with distinctive spikes in the tubular epithelium and podocytes. Furthermore, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 was found to be upregulated in patients with COVID-19, and immunostaining with SARS-CoV nucleoprotein antibody was positive in tubules. In addition to the direct virulence of SARS-CoV-2, factors contributing to acute kidney injury included systemic hypoxia, abnormal coagulation, and possible drug or hyperventilation-relevant rhabdomyolysis. Thus, our studies provide direct evidence of the invasion of SARSCoV-2 into kidney tissue.

The global outbreak of this novel coronavirus has now infected >8 million people worldwide with >2 million cases in the US (June 17th, 2020). There is an urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics to combat the spread of this coronavirus. Similarly, the development of diagnostic and research tools to determine infection and vaccine efficacy are critically needed. Molecular assays have been developed to determine viral genetic material present in patients. Serological assays have been developed to determine humoral responses to the spike protein or receptor binding domain (RBD). Detection of functional antibodies can be accomplished through neutralization of live SARS-CoV2 virus, but requires significant expertise, an infectible stable cell line, a specialized BioSafety Level 3 (BSL-3) facility. As large numbers of people return from quarantine, it is critical to have rapid diagnostics that can be widely adopted and employed to assess functional antibody levels in the returning workforce. This type of surrogate neutralization diagnostic can also be used to assess humoral immune responses induced in patients from the large number of vaccine and immunotherapy trials currently on-going. Here we describe a rapid serological diagnostic assay for determining antibody receptor blocking and demonstrate the broad utility of the assay by measuring the antibody functionality of sera from small animals and non-human primates immunized with an experimental SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and using sera from infected patients.","Walker, Susanne N.; Chokkalingam, Neethu; Reuschel, Emma L.; Purwar, Mansi; Xu, Ziyang; Gary, Ebony N.; Kim, Kevin Y.; Schultheis, Katherine; Walters, Jewell; Ramos, Stephanie; Smith, Trevor R.F.; Broderick, Kate E.; Tebas, Pablo; Patel, Ami; Weiner, David B.; Kulp, Daniel W.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.158527,657

All skeletal Class III patients who were candidates for orthogenetic surgery were included. They underwent mandibular setback surgery using bilateral sagittal split osteotomy. Cephalometric assessments in relation to hyoid bone position and posterior airway space (PAS) were conducted one day preoperatively (T0), as well as one week (T1), six months (T2) and one year (T3) postoperatively, determining the parameters like the Long axis of the hyoid bone (LAH), Retrognation (RGn), Hyoidale (H), Palatal plane (PP), Mandibular plane (MP) and C3 Vertebrae (C3). All cephalograms were examined using AudaxCeph, Planmeca software. The data analysis was performed via SPSS-19 (P<0.05) RESULTS: 25 class III patients, including 18 females (72%) and 7 males (28%) with a mean age of 24.32±5.87, were studied. The cephalometric analysis demonstrated significant decreases in variable angles during the follow-up periods, except for LAH-MP angle (P<0.001). The hyoid bone moved downward and backward relative to its original position following the mandibular setback surgery. However, the bone gradually returned to the preoperative location between 6 to 12 months postoperatively. CONCLUSION: The findings revealed the downward and backward movement of the hyoid bone following the mandibular setback surgery, returned near to its preoperative position after 1 year, postoperatively.","Hasanzadeh Moghaddam, Hojjat; Labafchi, Ali; Mortazavi, Samareh; Khorasanchi, Maryam; Tohidi, Elahe; Hoseini-zarch, Seyed-Hosein; Samieirad, Sahand",World J Plast Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34307097/; https://doi.org/10.29252/wjps.10.2.46,657

644117,A predictive model and country risk assessment for COVID-19: An application of the Limited Failure Population concept,2020-08-24,"INTRODUCTION: This study was designed to explore the role of acetylcholine (ACh) in pulmonary viral infection and recovery. Inflammatory control is critical to recovery from respiratory viral infection. ACh secreted from non-neuronal sources, including lymphocytes, plays an important, albeit underappreciated, role in regulating immune-mediated inflammation. METHODS: ACh and lymphocyte cholinergic status in the lungs were measured over the course of influenza infection and recovery. The role of ACh was examined by inhibiting ACh synthesis in vivo. Pulmonary inflammation was monitored by Iba1 immunofluorescence, using a novel automated algorithm. Tissue repair was monitored histologically. RESULTS: Pulmonary ACh remained constant through the early stage of infection and increased during the peak of the acquired immune response. As the concentration of ACh increased, cholinergic lymphocytes appeared in the BAL and lungs. Cholinergic capacity was found primarily in CD4 T cells, but also in B cells and CD8 T cells. The cholinergic CD4(+) T cells bound to influenza-specific tetramers and were retained in the resident memory regions of the lung up to 2 months after infection. Histologically, cholinergic lymphocytes were found in direct physical contact with activated macrophages throughout the lung. Inflammation was monitored by ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) immunofluorescence, using a novel automated algorithm. When ACh production was inhibited, mice exhibited increased tissue inflammation and delayed recovery. Histologic examination revealed abnormal tissue repair when ACh was limited. CONCLUSION: These findings point to a previously unrecognized role for ACh in the transition from active immunity to recovery and pulmonary repair following respiratory viral infection.","Horkowitz, Alexander P; Schwartz, Ashley V; Alvarez, Carlos A; Herrera, Edgar B; Thoman, Marilyn L; Chatfield, Dale A; Osborn, Kent G; Feuer, Ralph; George, Uduak Z; Phillips, Joy A",Immunotargets Ther,https://doi.org/10.2147/itt.s279228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33365281/,657

METHODS: This study used relevant data from the National Health Emergency Operation Center to estimate general hospital and ICU bed surge capacity and tipping points under 3 distinct transmission scenarios. RESULTS: The study results reveal that hospitals in the KSA need to be supplied with additional 4372 hospital beds to care for COVID-19 positive cases if the pandemic continues over a 6 months’ period. At the same time, it requires additional 2192 or 1461 hospital beds if the pandemic persists over a 12- or 18-month period, respectively, to manage hospitalized COVID-19 overloads. The health system surge capacity would suffer from a shortage of 1600, 797, and 540 ICU beds under the 3 transmission scenarios to absorb critical and intensive care COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the urgent need for additional hospital and ICU beds in the face of critical COVID-19 cases in KSA. The study recommends further assessment measures to the health system surge capacity to keep the Saudi health system prepared during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alqahtani, Fahad; Khan, Anas; Alowais, Jalal; Alaama, Tareef; Jokhdar, Hani",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33866983/; https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.117,657

But the immunofunction was still unclear. The objective of our study was to assess the immunofunction in SFTS patients. Immunofunction test with flow cytometry which contains CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, B cells and NK cells would be used for detecting serum samples collected from 34 SFTS cases and 20 healthy donors. We found that CD3+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes were significantly diminished in SFTS compared to normal control. In contrast, the percentage of NK cells was elevated. Further analysis revealed that the number of CD3+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes showed that there was a more robust pattern of depression in acute phase and severe SFTS infection compared to the patients in recovery phase and mild SFTS infection. But NK cells were significantly increased in acute phase and severe SFTS. They reverted to the near normal levels in convalescent phase. Additionally, the levels of CD3+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes progressively decreased in death group when compared with the survival group, but the level of B cells was higher. The damages of immune system were obvious, and the immune dysfunction might be partly responsible for disease progression of patients with SFTSV infection.","Sun, Liping; Hu, Yanjie; Niyonsaba, Aime; Tong, Qiaoxia; Lu, Li; Li, Huiyu; Jie, Shenghua",Clin Exp Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10238-013-0259-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24068614/,657

Methods: Random digit dialing recruited a population-representative sample of 1208 Chinese Hong Kong citizens (mean age=46.89 years; 63% female) in the first two weeks of February 2015. Respondents gave their informed consent and reported personal, social, and economic resource loss since the Umbrella Movement (Conservation of Resources-Evaluation), current anxiety symptoms (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and self-rated health (1=very good, 4=very bad). RESULTS: A total of 47.35% (95% CI=44.55, 50.17) respondents reported moderate/severe anxiety symptoms and 14.4% (95% CI=12.54, 16.50) reported moderate/severe depressive symptoms; 9.11% (95% CI=7.61, 10.86) reported “poor” or “very poor” health. Multivariable regressions revealed that personal and social resource loss was associated with higher anxiety and depressive symptoms and greater odds of “very poor” health (adjusted odds ratios/incidence rate ratios=5–102%), independent of lower education level and income and being unmarried. LIMITATIONS: This study was cross-sectional in nature and thus could not determine causality from the associations between resource loss and outcome variables. Second, the telephone survey relied on self-reports; response bias and social desirability could influence respondents' answers and discount data validity. Third, potential confounders such as preexisting mental and physical health issues and concurrent predictors like exposure to the Umbrella Movement were not assessed. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies following any recent political movement (e.g., The Arab Spring) to quantify distress and the associated correlates of distress among affected citizens. Perceived psychosocial resource losses were critical predictors of poor outcomes.","Kai Hou, Wai; Hall, Brian J.; Canetti, Daphna; Lau, Kam Man; Ng, Sin Man; Hobfoll, Stevan E.",J Affect Disord,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2015.07.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032715303177; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032715303177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26232750/,657

Effective strategies for financing healthcare are critical in achieving this goal yet remain a challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This systematic review aims to determine reported health financing mechanisms in SSA within the published literature and summarize potential learnings. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted aligned with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. On 19 to 30 July 2019, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Global Health Database, the Cochrane Library, Scopus and JSTOR were searched for literature published from 2005. Studies describing health financing approaches for UHC in SSA were included. Evidence was synthesised in form of a table and thematic analysis. RESULTS: Of all records, 39 papers were selected for inclusion. Among the included studies, most studies were conducted in Kenya (n = 7), followed by SSA as a whole (n = 6) and Nigeria (n = 5). More than two thirds of the selected studies reported the importance of equitable national health insurance schemes for UHC. The results indicate that a majority of health care revenue in SSA is from direct out-of-pocket payments. Another common financing mechanism was donor funding, which was reported by most of the studies. The average quality score of all studies was 81.6%, indicating a high appraisal score. The interrater reliability Cohen’s kappa score, κ=0.43 (p = 0.002), which showed a moderate level of agreement. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate health financing strategies that safeguard financial risk protection underpin sustainable health services and the attainment of UHC. It is evident from the review that innovative health financing strategies in SSA are needed. Some limitations of this review include potentially skewed interpretations due to publication bias and a higher frequency of publications included from two countries in SSA. Establishing evidence-based and multi-sectoral strategies tailored to country contexts remains imperative.

Though drugs like remdesivir, favipiravir, and dexamethasone found beneficial for COVID-19 management, they have limitations clinically, and vaccine development takes a long time. The researchers have reported key proteins which could act as druggable targets. Among them, the major protease M(pro) is first published, plays a prominent role in viral replication and an attractive drug-target for drug discovery. Hence, to target M(pro) and inhibit it, we accomplished the virtual screening of US-FDA approved drugs using well-known drug repurposing approach by computer-aided tools. METHODS: The protein M(pro), PDB-ID 6LU7 was imported to Maestro graphical user interphase of Schrödinger software. The US-FDA approved drug structures are imported from DrugBank and docked after preliminary protein and ligand preparation. The drugs are shortlisted based on the docking scores in the Standard Precision method (SP-docking) and then based on the type of molecular interactions they are studied for molecular dynamics simulations. RESULTS: The docking and molecular interactions studies, five drugs emerged as potential hits by forming hydrophilic, hydrophobic, electrostatic interactions. The drugs such as arbutin, terbutaline, barnidipine, tipiracil and aprepitant identified as potential hits. Among the drugs, tipiracil and aprepitant interacted with the M(pro) consistently, and they turned out to be most promising. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the possible exploration for drug repurposing using computer-aided docking tools and the potential roles of tipiracil and aprepitant, which can be explored further in the treatment of COVID-19.","Baby, Krishnaprasad; Maity, Swastika; Mehta, Chetan H.; Suresh, Akhil; Nayak, Usha Y.; Nayak, Yogendra",Arch Med Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.09.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0188440920309577; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0188440920309577; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962867/,657

Early detection of public health risks is one of the core functions. In order to improve surveillance and detection, a better understanding of the health system conditions and their influencing factors are needed. The Israeli Ministry of Health/IHR National Focal Point held a workshop to elucidate health system conditions and their influencing factors that enable earlier detection. The workshop methodology employed a stepwise, small working group analysis approach to elucidate the conditions and their influencing factors affecting each stage of recognition, assessment, and reporting of infectious disease outbreaks, at the local, regional and national levels. In order to detect public health risks earlier, the detection process needs to be moved closer to the local communities and start with building capacity within communities. Building capacity and engaging with local and diverse communities requires significant changes in the governance approach and include information sharing, multi-sectoral communication and coordination across various levels before, during and after public health emergencies. Across the regions, low-, mid- and high-income countries seem to struggle more with governance and information sharing rather than with technical capacities and capabilities.","Adini, Bruria; Singer, Shepherd Roee; Ringel, Ronit; Dickmann, Petra",Health Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288952/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2019.06.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851019301575; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168851019301575,657

However, epidemiological data on outbreak-associated depressive morbidity of female adolescents are not available. This study determines the incidence and correlates of depression among female adolescents aged 11–18 years during the COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China. METHODS: A large cross-sectional sample, nationwide online survey was conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak. Depression was assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and the correlative factors of depression were analyzed. RESULTS: In this study, 4805 female adolescents were enrolled with a median (range) age of 15 (11–18) years. Of them, 1899 (39.5%) suffered from depression with a CES-D score of > 15. The onset of depression was significantly related to age, grade, distant learning, attitude toward COVID-19, sleep duration, and physical exercise duration. Furthermore, participants aged 15–18 years (OR = 1.755, 95% CI: 1.550–1.987, p < 0.001), participating in distant learning (OR = 0.710, 95% CI: 0.564–0.894, p = 0.004), concerned about COVID-19 (OR = 0.414, 95% CI: 0.212–0.811, p = 0.010), with sleep duration/day of < 6 h (OR = 2.603, 95% CI: 1.946–3.483, p < 0.001),and with physical exercise duration/day < 30 min (OR = 1.641, 95% CI: 1.455–1.850, p < 0.001) represented to be independent factors for suffering from depression. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 outbreak, depression was common among female adolescents. Older age, distant learning, concern about COVID-19, short sleep duration, and physical exercise duration represented the independent factors for suffering from depression.","Zhou, Jiaojiao; Yuan, Xiaofei; Qi, Han; Liu, Rui; Li, Yaqiong; Huang, Huanhuan; Chen, Xu; Wang, Gang",Global Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32723373/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00601-3,657

Fluid resuscitation with commercially available crystalloid and colloid solutions only provides transient benefits, followed by fluid extravasation and tissue edema through the inflamed endothelium. The increased molecular weight (M.W.) of polymerized human serum albumin (PolyHSA) can limit fluid extravasation, leading to restoration of hemodynamics. In this prospective study, we evaluated how fluid resuscitation with PolyHSA impacts the hemodynamic and immune response in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced endotoxemia mouse model. Additionally, we evaluated fluid resuscitation with PolyHSA in a model of polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Resuscitation with PolyHSA attenuated the immune response and improved the maintenance of systemic hemodynamics and restoration of microcirculatory hemodynamics. This decrease in inflammatory immune response and maintenance of vascular wall shear stress likely contributes to the maintenance of vascular integrity following fluid resuscitation with PolyHSA. The sustained restoration of perfusion, decrease in pro-inflammatory immune response, and improved vascular integrity that results from the high M.W. of PolyHSA indicates that a PolyHSA based solution is a potential resuscitation fluid for endotoxic and septic shock.","Belcher, Donald A.; Williams, Alexander T.; Palmer, Andre F.; Cabrales, Pedro",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035380/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90431-z,657
661817,Meditating in Virtual Reality 3: 360° Video of Perceptual Presence of Instructor,2021-03-23,"INTRODUCTION: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a rapidly implemented restructuring of UK healthcare services. The The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore, became a central hub for the provision of trauma services for North Central/East London (NCEL) while providing a musculoskeletal tumour service for the south of England, the Midlands, and Wales and an urgent spinal service for London. This study reviews our paediatric practice over this period in order to share our experience and lessons learned. Our hospital admission pathways are described and the safety of surgical and interventional radiological procedures performed under general anaesthesia (GA) with regards to COVID-19 in a paediatric population are evaluated. METHODS: All paediatric patients (≤ 16 years) treated in our institution during the six-week peak period of the pandemic were included. Prospective data for all paediatric trauma and urgent elective admissions and retrospective data for all sarcoma admissions were collected. Telephone interviews were conducted with all patients and families to assess COVID-19 related morbidity at 14 days post-discharge. RESULTS: Overall, 100 children underwent surgery or interventional radiological procedures under GA between 20 March and 8 May 2020. There were 35 trauma cases, 20 urgent elective orthopaedic cases, two spinal emergency cases, 25 admissions for interventional radiology procedures, and 18 tumour cases. 78% of trauma cases were performed within 24 hours of referral. In the 97% who responded at two weeks following discharge, there were no cases of symptomatic COVID-19 in any patient or member of their households. CONCLUSION: Despite the extensive restructuring of services and the widespread concerns over the surgical and anaesthetic management of paediatric patients during this period, we treated 100 asymptomatic patients across different orthopaedic subspecialties without apparent COVID-19 or unexpected respiratory complications in the early postoperative period. The data provides assurance for health care professionals and families and informs the consenting process.

The study aimed to analyze the psychological response to the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of perceived stress and its related factors among university students in south-east Serbia. The study was conducted during the increased incidence of COVID-19 in Serbia. METHOD: A total of 434 students from the public university in south-east Serbia enrolled in the study and completed the measures of socio-demographic data, the perceived stress scale (PSS-10), the Coping Strategy Indicator (CSI) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). The data were analyzed through quantitative and qualitative methods. RESULTS: Study findings suggest that the mean perceived stress score was placed to 20.43 (± 7.67). Our model showed that female gender, higher scores on anxiety/insomnia and depression subscale as well as the coping strategy avoidance predicted higher perceived stress, while higher scores on social dysfunction were related to the reduced perceived stress scores. CONCLUSION: Notwithstanding the study limitation, findings provided authentic data of stress reactions of the students in south-east Serbia during the COVID-19 outbreak. The findings confirm the need to examine students' experiences in emergencies and crises, as well as to make a plan for online stress management programs that would help alleviate stress during a global pandemic.","Kostić, Jelena; Žikić, Olivera; Đorđević, Vladimir; Krivokapić, Žilijeta",Ann Gen Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827625/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12991-021-00346-2,657

Cancer has been reported as a major risk factor for adverse outcomes of and death from COVID-19. We extracted data from the World Health Organization's progress reports and from the Italian Council of Medicine. In addition, we retrieved clinical data on patients with cancer and with confirmed COVID-19 in our institution. As of 2nd April 2020, 110,574 COVID-19 cases and 13,157 deaths have been reported in Italy, representing a global share of 5.1% and 28.9% for incidence and mortality, respectively. In Italy, we report the analysis of the Italian Medical Council on 909 patients who died from COVID-19; of whom, 16.5% were patients with cancer. The population was enriched with subjects with multiple comorbid non-communicable diseases, with less than 1% of the population presenting no comorbid conditions. At the patient level, we identified nine patients referred to our department in the last two months who were receiving standard-of-care or experimental medications in the curative and palliative settings. The median age was 68 years (range = 42–79 years), and patients carried a median of one comorbid condition (0–2); two of nine patients presented with severe COVID-19 and were receiving inpatient care. None of the patients receiving immunotherapy experienced severe adverse outcomes, and four patients were discharged with complete reversal of the clinical syndrome and SARS-CoV-2 clearance. Learning from the experience of countries with a high burden, efforts must be made to assure the access of patients with cancer to treatments, prioritising the cancer health interventions based on their intrinsic value and limiting the exposure to an unacceptable risk of infection for both health providers and patients. Any significant work in the design and implementation of health system actions, including clinical care, must be framed as an initiative under the global response agenda and through a community approach, with the intention of pursuing common goals to tackle COVID-19 and cancer, as ‘One Community’ working for ‘One Health's.","Trapani, Dario; Marra, Antonio; Curigliano, Giuseppe",Eur J Cancer,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804920302203?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959804920302203; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.04.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32380430/,657

(2) Methods: Using the PICOS scheme, we searched for studies published in peer-reviewed journals in English or German between 2000 and 2020. Out of 7018 results, 71 studies were included and evaluated in this synthesis using the Oxford Level of Evidence Scale. (3) Results: The 63 studies that included a communication component revealed a positive effect on different proximal outcomes (i.e., communication skills). Three studies revealed a beneficial effect of communication trainings on distal performance indicators (i.e., patient safety), but only to a limited extent. Most studies simultaneously examined different groups, however, those addressing healthcare providers were more common than those with students (61 vs. 12). Only nine studies targeted expectant mothers. Overall, the evidence level of studies was low (only 11 RCTs), with 24 studies with an evidence level I-II, 35 with level III, and 10 with level IV.

Most antiviral drugs act as passive defenders to inhibit viral replication inside the cell, while a few of them function as gate keepers to combat viruses outside the cell, including fusion inhibitors, e.g., enfuvirtide, and receptor antagonists, e.g., maraviroc, as well as virus inactivators (including attachment inhibitors). Different from fusion inhibitors and receptor antagonists that must act in the presence of target cells, virus inactivators can actively inactivate cell-free virions in the blood, through interaction with one or more sites in the envelope glycoproteins (Envs) on virions. Notably, a number of protein- and peptide-based virus inactivators (PPVIs) under development are expected to have a better utilization rate than the current antiviral drugs and be safer for in vivo human application than the chemical-based virus inactivators. Here we have highlighted recent progress in developing PPVIs against several important enveloped viruses, including HIV, influenza virus, Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV), and the potential use of PPVIs for urgent treatment of infection by newly emerging or re-emerging viruses.","Su, Xiaojie; Wang, Qian; Wen, Yumei; Jiang, Shibo; Lu, Lu",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32523582/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01063,657

Yet, important questions such as how deadly it is or its degree of spread within different countries remain unanswered. In this work, we exploit the 'universal' growth of the mortality rate with age observed in different countries since the beginning of their respective outbreaks, combined with the results of the antibody prevalence tests in the population of Spain, to unveil both unknowns. We validate these results with an analogous antibody rate survey in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland. We also argue that the official number of deaths over 70 years old is importantly underestimated in most of the countries, and we use the comparison between the official records with the number of deaths mentioning COVID-19 in the death certificates to quantify by how much. Using this information, we estimate the fatality infection ratio (IFR) for the different age segments and the fraction of the population infected in different countries assuming a uniform exposure to the virus in all age segments. We also give estimations for the non-uniform IFR using the sero-epidemiological results of Spain, showing a very similar growth of the fatality ratio with age. Only for Spain, we estimate the probability (if infected) of being identified as a case, being hospitalized or admitted in the intensive care units as function of age. In general, we observe a nearly exponential growth of the fatality ratio with age, which anticipates large differences in total IFR in countries with different demographic distributions, with numbers that range from 1.82% in Italy, to 0.62% in China or even 0.14% in middle Africa.","Seoane, B.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.05.20123646; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.05.20123646v1?rss=1,657

New SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) are emerging all over the world, with the threat of being more readily transmitted, being more virulent, or escaping naturally acquired and vaccine-induced immunity. At least three major prototypic VoC have been identified, i.e. the UK (B.1.1.7), South African (B.1.351) and Brazilian (B.1.1.28.1), variants. These are replacing formerly dominant strains and sparking new COVID-19 epidemics and new spikes in excess mortality. We studied the effect of infection with prototypic VoC from both B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 lineages in Syrian golden hamsters to assess their relative infectivity and pathogenicity in direct comparison to two basal SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in early 2020. A very efficient infection of the lower respiratory tract of hamsters by these VoC is observed. In line with clinical evidence from patients infected with these VoC, no major differences in disease outcome were observed as compared to the original strains as was quantified by (i) histological scoring, (ii) micro-computed tomography, and (iii) analysis of the expression profiles of selected antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. Noteworthy however, in hamsters infected with VoC B.1.1.7, a particularly strong elevation of proinflammatory cytokines was detected.

FMT consists of the administration of fresh or frozen fecal microorganisms from a healthy donor into the intestinal tract of diseased patients. At this time, in according to healthcare authorities, FMT is mainly used to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile. Despite the existence of a few existing stool banks worldwide and many studies of the FMT, there is no standard method for producing material for FMT, and there are a multitude of factors that can vary between the institutions. The main constraints for the therapeutic uses of FMT are safety concerns and acceptability. Technical and logistical issues arise when establishing such a non-standardized treatment into clinical practice with safety and proper governance. In this context, our manuscript describes a process of donor safety screening for FMT compiling clinical and biological examinations, questionnaires and interviews of donors. The potential risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus by the use of fecal microbiota for transplantation must be taken urgently into consideration. We discuss a standardized procedure of collection, preparation and cryopreservation of fecal samples through to the administration of material to patients, and explore the risks and limits of this method of FMT. The future success of medicine employing microbiota transplantation will be tightly related to its modulation and manipulation to combat dysbiosis. To achieve this goal, standard and strict methods need to be established before performing any type of FMT.","Nicco, Carole; Paule, Armelle; Konturek, Peter; Edeas, Marvin",Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32326509/; https://doi.org/10.3390/diseases8020009,657

As such, we employed a nanolipoprotein (NLP) platform to enhance the efficacy of innate immune agonists. Here, we demonstrate that the synthetic Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG) can be readily incorporated into NLPs. Conjugation of MPLA and CpG to NLPs (MPLA:NLP and CpG:NLP, respectively) significantly enhanced their immunostimulatory profiles both in vitro and in vivo compared to administration of agonists alone, as evidenced by significant increases in cytokine production, cell surface expression of activation markers, and upregulation of immunoregulatory genes. Importantly, enhancement of cytokine production by agonist conjugation to NLPs was also observed in primary human dendritic cells. Furthermore, BALB/c mice pretreated with CpG:NLP constructs survived a lethal influenza challenge whereas pretreatment with CpG alone had no effect on survival.","Weilhammer, Dina R.; Blanchette, Craig D.; Fischer, Nicholas O.; Alam, Shabnam; Loots, Gabriela G.; Corzett, Michele; Thomas, Cynthia; Lychak, Cheri; Dunkle, Alexis D.; Ruitenberg, Joyce J.; Ghanekar, Smita A.; Sant, Andrea J.; Rasley, Amy",Biomaterials,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961213011216; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24075406/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0142961213011216,657

However, due to the overwhelming public health impact of this virus, a vaccine is needed urgently. Despite the tireless efforts of scientist and clinicians, there is still no safe and effective vaccine that provides sterilizing immunity. A vaccine that provides sterilizing immunity against HIV infection remains elusive in part due to the following reasons: 1) degree of diversity of the virus, 2) ability of the virus to evade the hosts’ immunity, and 3) lack of appropriate animal models in which to test vaccine candidates. There have been several attempts to stimulate the immune system to provide protection against HIV-infection. Here, we will discuss attempts that have been made to induce sterilizing immunity, including traditional vaccination attempts, induction of broadly neutralizing antibody production, DNA vaccines, and use of viral vectors.

675852,Research on Classification of COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Image Modal Feature Fusion Based on Deep Learning,2021-08-24,"BACKGROUND: The COVID‐19 outbreak has resulted in collision between patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 and those with cancer on different fronts. Patients with cancer have been impacted by deferral, modification, and even cessation of therapy. Adaptive measures to minimize hospital exposure, following the precautionary principle, have been proposed for cancer care during COVID‐19 era. We present here a consensus on prioritizing recommendations across the continuum of sarcoma patient care. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 125 recommendations were proposed in soft‐tissue, bone, and visceral sarcoma care. Recommendations were assigned as higher or lower priority if they cannot or can be postponed at least 2–3 months, respectively. The consensus level for each recommendation was classified as “strongly recommended” (SR) if more than 90% of experts agreed, “recommended” (R) if 75%–90% of experts agreed and “no consensus” (NC) if fewer than 75% agreed. Sarcoma experts from 11 countries within the Sarcoma European‐Latin American Network (SELNET) consortium participated, including countries in the Americas and Europe. The European Society for Medical Oncology‐Magnitude of clinical benefit scale was applied to systemic‐treatment recommendations to support prioritization. RESULTS: There were 80 SRs, 35 Rs, and 10 NCs among the 125 recommendations issued and completed by 31 multidisciplinary sarcoma experts. The consensus was higher among the 75 higher‐priority recommendations (85%, 12%, and 3% for SR, R, and NC, respectively) than in the 50 lower‐priority recommendations (32%, 52%, and 16% for SR, R, and NC, respectively). CONCLUSION: The consensus on 115 of 125 recommendations indicates a high‐level of convergence among experts. The SELNET consensus provides a tool for sarcoma multidisciplinary treatment committees during the COVID‐19 outbreak. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The Sarcoma European‐Latin American Network (SELNET) consensus on sarcoma prioritization care during the COVID‐19 era issued 125 pragmatical recommendations distributed as higher or lower priority to protect critical decisions on sarcoma care during the COVID‐19 pandemic. A multidisciplinary team from 11 countries reached consensus on 115 recommendations. The consensus was lower among lower‐priority recommendations, which shows reticence to postpone actions even in indolent tumors.

677984,COVIDNet-CT: A Tailored Deep Convolutional Neural Network Design for Detection of COVID-19 Cases From Chest CT Images,2020-12-23,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is associated with a prothrombotic state. We performed a meta-analysis of proportions to estimate the weighted average incidence of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We searched various medical databases for relevant studies from 31 December 2019 till 30 September 2020. We included observational studies that reported the incidence of PTE in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. We extracted data related to study characteristics, patient demographics, and the incidence of PTE. Risk of bias was assessed by using the ROBINS-I tool. Statistical analysis was performed with R 3.6.3. RESULTS: We included 14 studies with a total of 1182 patients in this study. Almost all patients in this meta-analysis received at least prophylactic anticoagulation. The weighted average incidence of PTE was 11.1% (95% CI 7.7% to 15.7%, I(2) = 78%, Cochran’s Q test P < 0.01). We performed univariate and multivariate meta-regression, which identified the proportion of males as a significant source of heterogeneity (P = 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to − 0.09) CONCLUSION: The weighted average incidence of PTE remains high even after prophylactic anticoagulation. PTE is a significant complication of COVID-19 especially in critically ill patients in the ICU.

We found confirmed infection for 19 (8 by reverse transcription PCR and 11 by serologic testing). Infection attack rates varied (2.7%–32.3%) by dormitory building. No deaths occurred. Independent risk factors for infection were direct contact with a confirmed case-patient and sharing a room with a confirmed case-patient; a protective factor was having an air conditioner in the bedroom. For 9 women from whom a second serum sample was collected, antibodies remained detectable at titers >1:20 by pseudoparticle neutralization tests (n = 8) and 90% plaque-reduction neutralization tests (n = 2). In closed high-contact settings, MERS coronavirus was highly infectious and pathogenicity was relatively low.","Van Kerkhove, Maria D.; Alaswad, Sadoof; Assiri, Abdullah; Perera, Ranawaka A.P.M.; Peiris, Malik; El Bushra, Hassan E.; BinSaeed, Abdulaziz A.",Emerg Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2510.190130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31423971/,657

Saudi communities still lack awareness of available protective measures to prevent the transmission of the virus. It is necessary to explore the current information-seeking strategies and preferences for communication tools among the Saudi population to promote dissemination of accurate information. Guided by McGuire’s Input–Output Persuasion Model and focusing on input variables (receiver characteristics, sources, message, channel and destination), we explored the current information-seeking strategies and preferences for different communication tools among residents of Riyadh (n = 658). Preferred and sought-after information sources on MERS. Most participants in the sample were female (61.7%), and the majority (98.2%) had internet access at home. The internet was the most commonly used source of information (39.5%) and the most endorsed channel for a MERS awareness campaign. Physicians were the preferred source of information (45.6%), followed by other health care providers (31.3%). In univariate multinomial logistic regression models, males and individuals aged ≤27 years were more likely to seek information from the internet than from physicians. Residents of southern and western Riyadh preferred physicians as a credible source of information over the Ministry of Health. The results of this survey provide valuable information on how to reach this population and for understanding how to launch an effective MERS risk communication campaign in a Saudi population.","Hoda, Jradi",Health Education Research,https://doi.org/10.1093/her/cyv061; https://academic.oup.com/her/article-pdf/31/1/12/7143435/cyv061.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26612051/,657
680915,Prediction of COVID-19 Confirmed Cases Combining Deep Learning Methods and Bayesian Optimization,2020-11-28,"OBJECTIVES: To explore changes in running behavior due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, assess presence of symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 and identify whether there is an association between running behavior and COVID-19. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: For this study we used a cohort of runners participating in an ongoing randomized controlled trial on running injury prevention among recreational runners. At baseline, demographic and training variables were collected. Seven weeks after starting the lockdown, information on running behavior (interval training, training with partner and physical distancing during training) and running habits (training frequency, duration, distance and speed) were obtained. Furthermore, healthcare utilization and symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 were assessed. To determine the association between running and symptoms suggestive for COVID-19, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of the 2586 included participants, 2427 (93.9%) participants continued running during lockdown with no significant changes in mean weekly training variables. A total of 253 participants (9.8%) experienced symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 and 10 participants tested positive for COVID-19. Two participants were admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 with both one day of admission. Running behavior and running habits were not associated with the onset of symptoms suggestive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The large majority of runners in the Netherlands did not change their running habits during lockdown. No association between running behavior or running habits and onset of symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 was identified. This implicates that running outdoor during lockdown does not negatively affect health of runners.","Cloosterman, Kyra L.A.; van Middelkoop, Marienke; Krastman, Patrick; de Vos, Robert-Jan",J Sci Med Sport,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2020.10.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33189596/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S144024402030788X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S144024402030788X,657

686328,Remote Concurrent Engineering: A-Team Studies in the Virtual World,2021,"INTRODUCTION: During the world-wide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, there is an urgent need to rapidly increase the readiness of hospitals. Emergency departments (EDs) are at high risk of facing unusual situations and need to prepare extensively in order to minimize risks to health care providers (HCPs) and patients. In situ simulation is a well-known method used in training to detect system gaps that could threaten safety. STUDY OBJECTIVES: One objective is to identify gaps, test hospital systems, and inform necessary modifications to the standard processes required by patients with COVID-19 presenting at the hospital. The other objective is to improve ED staff confidence in managing such patients, and to increase their skills in basic and advanced airway management and proper personal protective equipment (PPE) techniques. METHODS: This is a quasi-experimental study in which 20 unannounced mock codes were carried out in ED resuscitation and isolation rooms. A checklist was designed, validated, and used to evaluate team performances in three areas: donning, basic and advanced airway skills, and doffing. A pre- and post-intervention survey was used to evaluate staff members’ perceived knowledge of ED procedures related to COVID-19 and their airway management skills. RESULTS: A total of 20 mock codes were conducted in the ED. Overall, 16 issues that posed potential harm to staff or patients were identified and prioritized for immediate resolution. Approximately 57.4% of HCPs felt comfortable dealing with suspected/confirmed, unstable COVID-19 cases after mock codes, compared with 33.3% beforehand (P = .033). Of ED HCPs, 44.4% felt comfortable performing airway procedures for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases after mock codes compared with 29.6% beforehand. Performance of different skills was observed to be variable following the 20 mock codes. Skills with improved performance included: request of chest x-ray after intubation (88.0%), intubation done by the most experienced ED physician (84.5%), and correct sequence and procedure of PPE (79.0%). CONCLUSION: Mock codes identified significant defects, most of which were easily fixed. They included critical equipment availability, transporting beds that were too large to fit through doors, and location of biohazard bins. Repeated mock codes improved ED staff confidence in dealing with patients, in addition to performance of certain skills. In situ simulation proves to be an effective method for increasing the readiness of the ED to address the COVID-19 pandemic and other infection outbreaks.","Aljahany, Muna; Alassaf, Wajdan; Alibrahim, Ahmed A.; Kentab, Osama; Alotaibi, Abdullah; Alresseeni, Abdulaziz; Algarni, Abdulaziz; Algaeed, Hamad A.; Aljaber, Mohammed I.; Alruwaili, Badriyah; Aljohani, Khalid",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33081859/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x2000134x,657
687521,Closing editorial: Forecasting of epidemic spreading: lessons learned from the current covid-19 pandemic,2020-09-12,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition of the central nervous system (CNS) that presents with severe communication problems, impairment of social interactions, and stereotypic behaviours. Emerging studies indicate possible associations between viral infections and neurodegenerative and neurobehavioural conditions including autism. Viral infection during critical periods of early in utero neurodevelopment may lead to increased risk of autism in the offspring. This review is aimed at highlighting the association between viral infections, including viruses similar to COVID-19, and the aetiology of autism. A literature search was conducted using Pubmed, Ovid/Medline, and Google Scholar database. Relevant search terms included “rubella and autism”, “cytomegalovirus and autism”, “influenza virus and autism”, “Zika virus and autism”, “COVID-19 and autism”. Based on the search terms, a total of 141 articles were obtained and studies on infants or children with congenital or perinatal viral infection and autistic behaviour were evaluated. The possible mechanisms by which viral infections could lead to autism include direct teratogenic effects and indirect effects of inflammation or maternal immune activation on the developing brain. Brain imaging studies have shown that the ensuing immune response from these viral infections could lead to disruption of the development of brain regions and structures. Hence, long-term follow up is necessary for infants whose mothers report an inflammatory event due to viral infection at any time during pregnancy to monitor for signs of autism. Research into the role of viral infection in the development of ASD may be one avenue of improving ASD outcomes in the future. Early screening and diagnosis to detect, and maybe even prevent ASD are essential to reduce the burden of this condition.","Shuid, Ahmad Naqib; Jayusman, Putri Ayu; Shuid, Nazrun; Ismail, Juriza; Kamal Nor, Norazlin; Mohamed, Isa Naina",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18062817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33802042/,657

Methods We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) mathematical model to predict the health outcomes under an unmitigated scenario which comprises of air travel restrictions alone, and the current scenario consisting of air travel restrictions along with 8-week lockdown. In addition, we also evaluate the effectiveness of 8-week lockdown along with intensified public health measures at varying level of effectiveness. We assessed the impact of these interventions on COVID-19 related health outcomes in comparison to the unmitigated scenario. Next, we ascertain the need for augmenting infrastructure and the costs of COVID-19 management in India. Findings In the event of a lockdown for 8 weeks, the peak of the epidemic shifts by 34-76 days, and the number of cases at the end of 8-week lockdown reduces by 69% to 97% with varying effectiveness of lockdown. However, the cumulative long-term cases remain the same. Intensification of public health surveillance measures with 60% effectiveness is estimated to reduce the cases at peak and cumulative number of infections by 70% and 26.6% respectively. The requirement of ICU beds and ventilators would reduce by 83% with intensified public health measures. The cost of managing COVID-19 in India is nearly 4.5% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the absence of any intervention which increases to 6.2% with intensified public health measures for COVID-19 response. Conclusion Lockdown measures delay the onset of peak, and give much needed time to health system to prepare. Strengthening the public health system response in terms of testing, isolation treatment of cases, and contact tracing needs would lead to significant gains in terms of case load, and meeting health system needs.","Prinja, S.; Bahuguna, P.; Chugh, Y.; Vassal, A.; Pandey, A.; Aggarwal, S.; Arora, N.

This study also extended the model of goal-directed behavior (MGB) by incorporating the new concepts of NPI, and the perception of 2009 H1N1. The model found that desire, perceived behavioral control, frequency of past behavior, and non-pharmaceutical interventions predicted tourists’ intention but perceptions of 2009 H1N1 had nil effect on desire and intention. Personal non-pharmaceutical interventions were theorized as adaptive behavior of tourists intending to travel during a pandemic which should be supported by tourism operators on a system-wide basis. Practically, this study dealt with the issue of influenza 2009 H1N1 with the study findings and implications providing government agencies, tourism marketers, policy-makers, transport systems, and hospitality services with important suggestions for NPI and international tourism during pandemics.","Lee, Choong-Ki; Song, Hak-Jun; Bendle, Lawrence J.; Kim, Myung-Ja; Han, Heesup",Tour Manag,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2011.02.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287736/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517711000501; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261517711000501,657
688726,An Automated Lightweight Deep Neural Network for Diagnosis of COVID-19 from Chest X-ray Images,2021-08-09,"BACKGROUND: BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine encoding a prefusion-stabilized, membrane-anchored severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) full-length spike protein. BNT162b2 is highly efficacious against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and is currently approved, conditionally approved, or authorized for emergency use worldwide. At the time of initial authorization, data beyond 2 months after vaccination were unavailable. METHODS: In an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, multinational, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned 44,165 participants 16 years of age or older and 2264 participants 12 to 15 years of age to receive two 30-μg doses, at 21 days apart, of BNT162b2 or placebo. The trial end points were vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety, which were both evaluated through 6 months after vaccination. RESULTS: BNT162b2 continued to be safe and have an acceptable adverse-event profile. Few participants had adverse events leading to withdrawal from the trial. Vaccine efficacy against Covid-19 was 91.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.0 to 93.2) through 6 months of follow-up among the participants without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection who could be evaluated. There was a gradual decline in vaccine efficacy. Vaccine efficacy of 86 to 100% was seen across countries and in populations with diverse ages, sexes, race or ethnic groups, and risk factors for Covid-19 among participants without evidence of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine efficacy against severe disease was 96.7% (95% CI, 80.3 to 99.9). In South Africa, where the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern B.1.351 (or beta) was predominant, a vaccine efficacy of 100% (95% CI, 53.5 to 100) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Through 6 months of follow-up and despite a gradual decline in vaccine efficacy, BNT162b2 had a favorable safety profile and was highly efficacious in preventing Covid-19.

Data regarding multidrug resistant (MDR) Candida species in COVID-19 patients is scarce, and nonexistent regarding Candida duobushaemulonii superinfections. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 34-year-old male presented to our institution with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 infection and developed Candida duobushaemulonii fungemia after multiple courses of antibiotics and prolonged mechanical ventilation. He died after recurrent pneumothorax led to respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. DISCUSSION: Bacterial and fungal infections are common complications of viral pneumonia in critically ill patients. Data regarding these infections in COVID-19 patients has been poorly studied with only a few cases reporting secondary infection, mostly without identifying specific pathogens. Prolonged hospital stays, invasive interventions (central venous catheter, mechanical ventilation), and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in COVID-19 infections could carry a high risk of bacterial and/or fungal superinfections. CONCLUSION: Strategies to improve outcome in COVID-19 ICU patients should include early recognition of candidemia and appropriate antifungal therapy.","Awada, Bassem; Alam, Walid; Chalfoun, Maria; Araj, George; Bizri, Abdul Rahman",J Mycol Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mycmed.2021.101168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34186378/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1156523321000585?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1156523321000585,657
