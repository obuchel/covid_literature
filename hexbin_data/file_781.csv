The objective of this study was to investigate the performance of multi-trait models in genomic prediction in a limited number of environments with G × E interactions. RESULTS: In total, 2,688 and 1,384 individuals with growth and reproduction phenotypes, respectively, from two Yorkshire pig populations with similar genetic backgrounds were genotyped with the PorcineSNP80 panel. Single- and multi-trait models with genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) and BayesC π were implemented to investigate their genomic prediction abilities with 20 replicates of five-fold cross-validation. Our results regarding between-environment genetic correlations of growth and reproductive traits (ranging from 0.618 to 0.723) indicated the existence of G × E interactions between these two Yorkshire pig populations. For single-trait models, genomic prediction with GBLUP was only 1.1% more accurate on average in the combined population than in single populations, and no significant improvements were obtained by BayesC π for most traits. In addition, single-trait models with either GBLUP or BayesC π produced greater bias for the combined population than for single populations. However, multi-trait models with GBLUP and BayesC π better accommodated G × E interactions, yielding 2.2% – 3.8% and 1.0% – 2.5% higher prediction accuracies for growth and reproductive traits, respectively, compared to those for single-trait models of single populations and the combined population. The multi-trait models also yielded lower bias and larger gains in the case of a small reference population. The smaller improvement in prediction accuracy and larger bias obtained by the single-trait models in the combined population was mainly due to the low consistency of linkage disequilibrium between the two populations, which also caused the BayesC π method to always produce the largest standard error in marker effect estimation for the combined population. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our findings confirmed that directly combining populations to enlarge the reference population is not efficient in improving the accuracy of genomic prediction in the presence of G × E interactions, while multi-trait models perform better in a limited number of environments with G × E interactions.","Song, Hailiang; Zhang, Qin; Ding, Xiangdong",J Anim Sci Biotechnol,781,0

Frank’s (in the 1970s) historical definitions of the constructs Meaning in Life (MiL) and demoralization, there have been a multitude of studies which have described them from different theoretical perspectives. These constructs are closely linked, with the lack of MiL as one of the subconstructs underlying the definition of demoralization. Numerous studies have shown that MiL and demoralization affect suicidality, as protective and risk factors, respectively. The Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS) is a more recent framework conceptualized by T. Joiner (in the 2000s) to provide an additional possible reading key in the effort to better understand suicidality. By analogy to a previous study by E. Kleiman & J. Beaver (2013), examining MiL and demoralization in suicidality through a perspective of the IPTS framework can be of considerable interest. This study showed, in a cohort of undergraduate students, that MiL mediated the relationship between two variables associated with IPTS (perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness) and suicidal ideation (SI). Taking into consideration future studies that these latter authors advocated, our aim is to verify this finding using a cross-sectional study. Differences in our approach would include a) studying a clinical population (suicidal patients attending an emergency department), b) analyzing relationships not only with SI but also with suicidal attempts (SA), and c) in consideration of the interconnection between MiL and demoralization, exploring also the possible role of demoralization as a mediator. The clinical implication lies in identifying multi-faceted targets that may be useful to mitigate suicidality risk in individuals, both in prevention and therapy intervention.","Costanza, Alessandra; Amerio, Andrea; Aguglia, Andrea; Serafini, Gianluca; Amore, Mario",Psychol Res Behav Manag,781,0

BACKGROUND In Italy, COVID outbreak has mostly occurred in the metropolitan area of Milan, and in the surrounding region of Lombardy, and previously ""conventional"" hospitals were converted into COVID spokes to increase ICU beds availability, and to allow only urgent CS procedures. METHODS Among urgent CS patients (left main stenosis with unstable angina, acute endocarditis, valvular regurgitation with impending heart failure), 10 patients (mean age = 57 ± 9 years), despite a negative admission triage, developed COVID-pneumonia postoperatively, at a median of 7 days after CS. RESULTS Patients showed typical lymphopenia, higher prothrombotic profile, and higher markers of inflammation (ferritin and interleukin-6 values). At the zenith of pulmonary distress, patients presented with severe hypoxia (median PaO2/FIO2 ratio = 116), requiring advanced noninvasive ventilation (Venturi mask and continuous positive airway pressure) in the majority of cases. All patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and low-molecular-weight heparin at anticoagulant dose. Overall in-hospital mortality was 10% (1/10), peaking 25% in patients who developed COVID pneumonia immediately after CS. The remaining patients, with late infection, were all discharged home without oxygen support, at a median of 25 days after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS As postoperative mortality in case of COVID pneumonia is not negligible, meticulous rules (precise triage, safe hospital path, high level of protection for health-care teams, prompt diagnosis of suspicious symptoms) should be strictly followed in patients undergoing CS during COVID pandemic. The role of therapies alternative to CS should be further assessed.","Garatti, Andrea; Castelvecchio, Serenella; Daprati, Andrea; Molfetta, Raffaella; Volpe, Marianna; De Vincentiis, Carlo; Parolari, Alessandro; Menicanti, Lorenzo",Annals of surgery,781,1

Examination of these studies showed they lacked validity due to a low sensitivity to detect HAO, and because they pre-date both advanced healthcare systems and the emergence of recent nosocomial pathogen challenges. The accepted inference: that as there are so few HAOs the focus of surveillance programmes should be on endemic and not epidemic infections (outbreaks), is therefore called into question. Current estimates of HAI burden are derived from Point Prevalence Surveys (PPS) which are neither designed to nor are capable of detecting HAOs. We considered the extensive Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT) work to prevent and prepare for perennial and novel HAOs and suggest that at present this endeavour is largely unseen, underestimated and undervalued. Any HAI burden estimate needs to comprise a more complete HAI summary than PPS data. This can only be done with a more inclusive surveillance system that has a wider focus than just prevalent infections. There is a real risk of redirection of the IPCT resource from outbreak prevention and preparedness work towards HAI that are counted: such a change could only further increase HAO risks.","Curran, Evonne T; Dalziel, Catherine E",Journal of infection prevention,781,6

Minimizing drug exposure will result in less frequent occurrence of significant adverse events and associated treatment costs. In the era of COVID-19 pandemic, there is additional benefit to minimizing the number of patient visits and hospital admissions. Limited information exists related to the outcomes and associated costs of existing treatment sequences. Additionally, treatment administration at different types of clinical sites results in varied reimbursement models, making informed evaluation of clinical and financial evidence challenging. Methods: The current study applies a budget impact model methodology in order to describe the associated impact of treatment selection and sequencing on outcomes and costs in the treatment of relapsed or refractory low-grade follicular lymphoma in first line therapy followed by Consolidation and also in first line therapy to second line therapy. Key model inputs included: Number of treatment cycles, number of days a treatment was received, duration of response (DOR), rate of side effects and associated costs, and total treatment costs, including drugs, medical treatment, laboratory testing and adverse event costs. Treatment outcomes were based on the published literature that summarized the overall response rate, median DOR, and toxicity. Treatment regimen costs were evaluated based on payer pricing, Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC), Average Selling Price (ASP) and Average Wholesale Price (AWP) and modified to adjust for weight-based dosing and negotiate payer reimbursement rates. Associated medical costs for medical treatment and supportive care were estimated using current Medicare fee schedule rates. Included were seven options for first line therapy of follicular lymphoma from 2020 NCCN Guidelines - (Bendamustine + rituximab (BR);Bendamustine + Obinutuzumab (OB);CHOP rituximab (RCHOP);CHOP + Obinutuzumab (OCHOP);CVP+ rituximab (RCVP);CVP + Obinutuzumab (OCVP);Lenalidomide + rituximab (R2)), followed by three for Consolidation (Rituximab maintenance (RM);Obinutuzumab maintenance (O);Radioimmunotherapy (RIT with 90 Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Y90-IT, Zevalin)) and three Second Line therapy options (RIT;Lenalidomide only;Lenalidomide + Obinutuzumab (LO)). Results: The treatment sequence of first line BR followed by Consolidation with RIT Y90 (Zevalin) had the longest predicted DOR (2586 days). The associated treatment sequence costs were $212,485 for BR followed by Y90-IT, compared with $233, 388 for BR followed by rituximab maintenance, which had a predicted DOR of 2478 days. The predicted DOR for treatment sequences starting with OCHOP, OCVP and RCHOP and followed by RIT with Y90-IT was approximately 1000 days less than BR followed by Y90-IT for a cost difference of $4,421, $12,914 and $25,826, respectively. The treatment sequence of first line BR followed by Second Line RIT Y90-IT had the second longest predicted DOR of 2586 days at costs of $212,485, compared to 2778 days for BR followed by LO, at a total sequence costs of $796,695. Conclusion: The use of Y90-IT in Consolidation or Second Line treatment demonstrated desired patient outcomes at one of the lowest cost profiles. Additionally, Y90-IT administration can be completed in only two clinic visits, reducing patient travel and contact, improving safety in an era of COVID-19 precautionary measures and reducing cost.

This frameshift occurs at a slippery sequence followed by an RNA structure motif that stimulates frameshifting. This motif is commonly assumed to be a simple stem–loop for HIV-1. In this study, we show that the frameshift stimulatory signal is more complex than believed and consists of a two-stem helix. The upper stem–loop corresponds to the classic stem–loop, and the lower stem is formed by pairing the spacer region following the slippery sequence and preceding this classic stem–loop with a segment downstream of this stem–loop. A three-purine bulge interrupts the two stems. This structure was suggested by enzymatic probing with nuclease V1 of an RNA fragment corresponding to the gag/pol frameshift region of HIV-1. The involvement of the novel lower stem in frameshifting was supported by site-directed mutagenesis. A fragment encompassing the gag/pol frameshift region of HIV-1 was inserted in the beginning of the coding sequence of a reporter gene coding for the firefly luciferase, such that expression of luciferase requires a –1 frameshift. When the reporter was expressed in COS cells, mutations that disrupt the capacity to form the lower stem reduced frameshifting, whereas compensatory changes that allow re-formation of this stem restored the frameshift efficiency near wild-type level. The two-stem structure that we propose for the frameshift stimulatory signal of HIV-1 differs from the RNA triple helix structure recently proposed.","Dulude, Dominic; Baril, Martin; Brakier-Gingras, Léa",,781,17

The costs include the direct cost of treating infected sites as well as the indirect costs incurred through lost yield. We first use a mean-field approximation to derive analytical results for the optimal treatment regimes that minimize the total cost of the epidemic. We distinguish short- and long-term epidemics. and show that seasonal control (short time scale) requires extreme treatment, either treating all sites or none or switching between the two at some stage during the season. The optimal long-term strategy requires an intermediate level of control that results in near eradication of the disease. We also demonstrate the importance of incorporating economic constraints by deriving a critical relationship between the epidemiological and economic parameters that determine the qualitative nature of the optimal treatment strategy. The set of optimal strategies is summarized in a policy plot, which can be used to determine the nature of the optimal treatment regime given prior knowledge of the epidemiological and economic parameters. Finally, we test the robustness of the analytical results, derived from the mean-field approximation, on the spatially explicit contact process and demonstrate robustness to implementation errors and misestimation of crucial parameters.","Forster, Graeme A; Gilligan, Christopher A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,781,33

There were dose-dependent increases in frequency and severity of solicited systemic adverse events, and to a lesser extent of local reactions, but the majority were mild or moderate and transient in duration. Immune responses when measured as IgG antibodies against S protein or its receptor-binding domain (RBD) by ELISA, and SARS-CoV-2-virus neutralizing antibodies measured by micro-neutralization, displayed dose-dependent increases. Median titers measured in these assays two weeks after the second 12 g dose were comparable to the median titers observed in convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients. Seroconversion (defined as a 4-fold increase over baseline titer) of virus neutralizing antibodies two weeks after the second vaccination occurred in all participants who received 12 g doses. Preliminary results in the subset of subjects who were enrolled with known SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity at baseline show that CVnCoV is also safe and well tolerated in this population, and is able to boost the pre-existing immune response even at low dose levels. Based on these results, the 12 g dose is selected for further clinical investigation, including a phase 2b/3 study that will investigate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the candidate vaccine CVnCoV.","Oostvogels, L.; Kremsner, P.; Kreidenweiss, A.; Leroux-Roels, I.; Leroux-Roels, G.; Kroidl, A.; Schunk, M.; Schindler, C.; Bosch, J.; Fendel, R.; Gabor, J.
