14200,Visualization of the HIV-1 Env glycan shield across scales,2020-11-10,"BACKGROUND: A pneumatocele is a transient thin-walled lesion and rare complication in adult pneumonia. A variety of infectious pathogens have been reported in children with pneumatoceles. We report the first case of adult pneumonia with pneumatocele formation that is likely caused by Streptococcus pyogenes and coinfection with influenza A virus. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old Japanese man presented with a one-week history of fever, sore throat, and arthralgia. He was referred to our university hospital for respiratory distress. He required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). Bacterial culture detected S. pyogenes in the bronchoscopic aspirates, which was not detected in blood. Although a rapid influenza antigen test was negative, an influenza A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was positive. Therefore, he was diagnosed with coinfection of influenza A and group A streptococcus (GAS) pneumonia complicated by probable streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. A chest radiograph on admission showed diffuse patchy opacification and consolidation in the bilateral lung fields. Multiple thin-walled cysts appeared in both middle lung fields on computed tomography (CT). On the following day, the bilateral cysts had turned into a mass-like opacity. The patient died despite intensive care. An autopsy was performed. The pathology investigation revealed multiple hematomas formed by bleeding in pneumatoceles. CONCLUSIONS: There have been no previous reports of a pneumatocele complicated by S. pyogenes in an adult patient coinfected with influenza A. Further molecular investigation revealed that the S. pyogenes isolate had the sequence type of emm3.","Sano, Masahiro; Shimamoto, Aya; Ueki, Nozomi; Sekino, Motohiro; Nakaoka, Hiroshi; Takaki, Masahiro; Yamashita, Yoshiro; Tanaka, Takeshi; Morimoto, Konosuke; Yanagihara, Katsunori; Nakashima, Masahiro; Ashizawa, Kazuto; Ariyoshi, Koya",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7688446/,653
14302,Geographies of insecure water access and the housing–water nexus in US cities,2020-11-17,"Dynamic consent (DC) was originally developed in response to challenges to the informed consent process presented by participants agreeing to ‘future research’ in biobanking. In the past 12 years, it has been trialled in a number of different projects, and examined as a new approach for consent and to support patient engagement over time. There have been significant societal shifts during this time, namely in our reliance on digital tools and the use of social media, as well as a greater appreciation of the integral role of patients in biomedical research. This paper reflects on the development of DC to understand its importance in an age where digital health is becoming the norm and patients require greater oversight and control of how their data may be used in a range of settings. As well as looking back, it looks forwards to consider how DC could be further utilised to enhance the patient experience and address some of the inequalities caused by the digital divide in society.","Teare, Harriet J.

14681,Direct quantification of in vivo mutagenesis and carcinogenesis using duplex sequencing,2020-12-29,"Despite inherent difficulties in defining and measuring stress, a scientific framework has been provided in recent years for understanding how disruptive life experiences might be translated into altered susceptibility to infectious diseases. Studies of the effects of stress on pathogenesis of infectious disease are highly relevant to assessment of the biological importance of the immune impairments that have been associated with stress. With a few notable exceptions, investigations of viral infections in humans and in animal models support the hypothesis that stress promotes the pathogenesis of such infections. Similar conclusions can be drawn from studies of bacterial infections in humans and animals and from a small number of studies of parasitic infections in rodent models. While many of these studies have substantial limitations, the data nonetheless suggest that stress is a potential cofactor in the pathogenesis of infectious disease. Given recent unprecedented advances in the neurosciences, in immunology, and in the field of microbial pathogenesis, the relationship between stress and infection should be a fruitful topic for interdisciplinary research.","Peterson, Phillip K.; Chao, Chun C.; Molitor, Thomas; Murtaugh, Michael; Strgar, Franc; Sharp, Burt M.",Rev Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7792926/,653
16606,Routes to cubic ice through heterogeneous nucleation,2021-03-30,"INTRODUCTION: Food pantries serve households in need, including many with a family member with a diet-related chronic disease, yet data on client priorities to inform hunger relief practices are lacking. We used a statewide client survey in Minnesota to determine needs and priorities of food pantry clients in 2017 and 2019 and to identify how well Minnesota pantries met those needs in 2019. METHODS: Our survey was administered in 2017 and 2019. Food pantries in Minnesota were mailed 25 surveys each, with instructions for administering the surveys anonymously to clients. Descriptive analyses compared 2017 and 2019 data and compared client priorities for foods and services with how often they were available at the pantry in 2019. RESULTS: The 2017 survey represented 4,321 clients from 188 pantries; the 2019 survey represented 5,529 clients from 220 pantries. Most measures of food pantry use were consistently high across the years; about three-quarters of clients had been visiting the pantry for a year or more. In 2019, 85% of clients said it was important to have fresh fruits and vegetables, but only 52% said these were always available. About two-thirds had a household member with a diet-related chronic disease. The ability to choose their own foods was clients’ top priority. CONCLUSION: The types of food most requested by clients tended to be healthy but were inconsistently available. Most important to clients was being able to choose their own food. Results underscore the need for continued monitoring of client priorities.","Caspi, Caitlin E.; Davey, Cynthia; Barsness, Christina Bliss; Gordon, Nora; Bohen, Laura; Canterbury, Marna; Peterson, Hikaru; Pratt, Rebekah",Prev Chronic Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8021143/,653
16826,Signatures of immune dysfunction in HIV and HCV infection share features with chronic inflammation in aging and persist after viral reduction or elimination,2021-04-06,"Developing new methods for modelling infectious diseases outbreaks is important for monitoring transmission and developing policy. In this paper we propose using semi-mechanistic Hawkes Processes for modelling malaria transmission in near-elimination settings. Hawkes Processes are well founded mathematical methods that enable us to combine the benefits of both statistical and mechanistic models to recreate and forecast disease transmission beyond just malaria outbreak scenarios. These methods have been successfully used in numerous applications such as social media and earthquake modelling, but are not yet widespread in epidemiology. By using domain-specific knowledge, we can both recreate transmission curves for malaria in China and Eswatini and disentangle the proportion of cases which are imported from those that are community based.","Unwin, H.

18362,High-resolution asymmetric structure of a Fab–virus complex reveals overlap with the receptor binding site,2021-06-08,"Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) infects multiple mammalian species including humans. A United States Midwest swine farm with approximately one thousand 3-month-old pigs experienced an event, in which more than 300 pigs showed neurological signs, like “down and peddling”, with approximately 40% mortality. A novel MRV was isolated from the diseased pigs. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolate was a reassortant virus containing viral gene segments from three MRV serotypes that infect human, bovine and swine. The M2 and S1 segment of the isolate showed 94% and 92% nucleotide similarity to the M2 of the MRV2 D5/Jones and the S1 of the MRV1 C/bovine/Indiana/MRV00304/2014, respectively; the remaining eight segments displayed 93%–95% nucleotide similarity to those of the MRV3 FS-03/Porcine/USA/2014. Pig studies showed that both MRV-infected and native contact pigs displayed fever, diarrhoea and nasal discharge. MRV RNA was detected in different intestinal locations of both infected and contact pigs, indicating that the MRV isolate is pathogenic and transmissible in pigs. Seroconversion was also observed in experimentally infected pigs. A prevalence study on more than 180 swine serum samples collected from two states without disease revealed 40%–52% positive to MRV. All results warrant the necessity to monitor MRV epidemiology and reassortment as the MRV could be an important pathogen for the swine industry and a novel MRV might emerge to threaten animal and public health.","Wang, Liping; Li, Yan; Walsh, Timothy; Shen, Zhenyu; Li, Yonghai; Deb Nath, Nirmalendu; Lee, Jinhwa; Zheng, Baoliang; Tao, Ying; Paden, Clinton R.; Queen, Krista; Zhang, Shuping; Tong, Suxiang; Ma, Wenjun",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8205024/,653

21906,"Norms of assertion in the United States, Germany, and Japan",2021-09-14,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Intraabdominal hemorrhage secondary to liver and kidney injury is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Endovascular arterial embolization is an established interventional radiology technique used to treat active bleeding, and its role in managing abdominal hemorrhages is growing, given the increasing trend for conservative treatment. Our study aims to retrospectively evaluate the technical and clinical results and the possible complications of arterial embolization procedures performed in emergency, in post-traumatic, iatrogenic, and pathological hepatic and renal bleedings. METHODS: We performed a ten-year, single-center retrospective survey (from January 2010 to December 2019) of all patients treated in emergency by intra-arterial embolization of liver and kidney bleeding. Preliminary CT angiography studies were evaluated, as well as the angiographic findings. Materials used, procedural data, and clinical outcomes, including complications, were recorded. RESULTS: The diagnostic angiography showed a single source of bleeding in 20 cases (66.7%), two bleeding vessels in 4 cases (13.3%), and multiple hemorrhagic sources in 6 cases (20%). All bleeding sources were successfully embolized; in 12 patients (40%), complete embolization was achieved with coils and 18 patients (60%) with hemostatic sponges. In one case, a second embolization procedure was performed for the persistence of hemodynamic instability. No major post-procedural complications were recorded. The mean procedure duration was 65.1 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience and literature data, the treatment of endovascular embolization in acute abdominal bleeding of hepatic and renal origin represents the treatment of choice, as it can provide complete therapeutic success in hemodynamically stable patients.

59573,Antiviral drugs proposed for COVID-19: action mechanism and pharmacological data.,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, telehealth was an emerging occupational therapy (OT) service delivery model possessing many positive attributes. These include the potential to offset well-documented global occupational therapy practitioner (OTP) shortages. However, wide-spread adoption of telehealth as a delivery model in school-based practice is lacking in the OT evidence literature. While the COVID-19 global health emergency propelled many OTPs into the use of telehealth technologies, in some cases with minimal preparation, an investigation was conducted into the likelihood of telehealth adoption when comprehensive training was provided so that appropriateness of student fit for telehealth could be determined and essential planning could take place. OBJECTIVE Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, a comprehensive training program was developed incorporating detailed perceptions of OTPs experienced in and new to telehealth in school-based practice as measured via surveys with the goal of increasing adoption of telehealth technologies for the delivery of OT services. Following the completion of the online New to Telehealth Pre-training survey, OTPs new to telehealth were invited to complete the OT Telehealth Primer: School-based Practice training program. Analysis of pre- and post-training surveys yielded information about attitudinal changes experienced post-training. METHODS Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, school-based occupational therapy practitioners (OTP) experienced in telehealth were invited to complete a survey exploring benefits and barriers encountered in the delivery of OT services using telehealth. OTPs new-to-telehealth were invited to complete a different survey intended to explore attitudes about the potential use of telehealth. Data collected from both surveys were used to develop a comprehensive training program, The OT Telehealth Primer for School-based Practice. OTPs new-to-telehealth were invited to complete the training program and a post-training survey. A descriptive data analysis was completed on responses from pre- to post-training surveys and the chi-square test of independence was used to evaluate difference in reported likelihood of adopting telehealth into practice before and after training. RESULTS Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, the top benefits identified by the OTP Experienced telehealth-user survey included: 1) service access, 2) collaboration and carry-over with team members, 3) efficiency themes, and4) student engagement and comfort. Top benefits identified by the OTP New to Telehealth survey identified the same top benefits after participating in the training program. A significant decrease in perceived barriers was noted in scores from pre- to post-training by OTPs new to telehealth. The perceived barriers that did not significantly decrease post-training suggest the need for future education and future protocol development. These included: unreliable internet, lack of hands-on opportunity and e-helpers' (parent, caregiver or support system available to assist the student in person during a telehealth session) decreased comfort with technology. After completing the training program, 80% of participants reported being likely to add telehealth as a delivery model for future OT practice. CONCLUSIONS Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, completion of the comprehensive training program OT Telehealth Primer: School-based Practice program yielded improved perceived benefits and an increased likelihood of telehealth adoption into practice by OTPs. However, both OTPs and school administrators require ongoing education for successful widespread adoption to be achieved thus offsetting the global shortage of OTPs and increasing service access. Future research, particularly related to available training and support for the rapid adoption of telehealth technologies during the COVID-19 global health emergency, will yield helpful information about the likelihood of continued use of telehealth in practice.","Abbott-Gaffney, Cynthia; Jacobs, Karen",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-203240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32925151/,653

If implemented, this would have devastating effects on Aboriginal populations. At the present time, vaccination rates in Aboriginal communities remain low. Once restrictions are lifted unvaccinated people will be at high risk of infection. The risks of serious illness and death among Aboriginal people from a variety of medical conditions are significantly greater than for the wider population. This is also the case with COVID-19 in First Nations populations around the world. The vulnerability of Aboriginal people is an enduring consequence of colonialism and is exacerbated by the fact that many live in over-crowded and poorly maintained houses in communities with under-resourced health services. A current workforce crisis and the demographic structure of the population have further hindered the effectiveness of vaccination programs. Aboriginal organisations have called on state and federal governments to delay any substantial easing of restrictions until full vaccination rates among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations aged sixteen years and older reach 90-95%. They have also called for additional support in the form of supply of vaccines, enhancement of workforce capacity and appropriate incentives to address hesitancy. Australia remains burdened by the legacy of centuries of harm and damage to its First Nations people.

62402,"The value of PCT, IL-6, and CRP in the early diagnosis and evaluation of COVID-19.",2021-01-01,"The production of functional nidovirus replication-transcription complexes involves extensive proteolytic processing by virus-encoded proteases. In this study, we characterized the viral main protease (M(pro)) of the type species, White bream virus (WBV), of the newly established genus Bafinivirus (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Torovirinae). Comparative sequence analysis and mutagenesis data confirmed that the WBV M(pro) is a picornavirus 3C-like serine protease that uses a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad embedded in a predicted two-β-barrel fold, which is extended by a third domain at its C terminus. Bacterially expressed WBV M(pro) autocatalytically released itself from flanking sequences and was able to mediate proteolytic processing in trans. Using N-terminal sequencing of autoproteolytic processing products we tentatively identified Gln↓(Ala, Thr) as a substrate consensus sequence. Mutagenesis data provided evidence to suggest that two conserved His and Thr residues are part of the S1 subsite of the enzyme's substrate-binding pocket. Interestingly, we observed two N-proximal and two C-proximal autoprocessing sites in the bacterial expression system. The detection of two major forms of M(pro), resulting from processing at two different N-proximal and one C-proximal site, in WBV-infected epithelioma papulosum cyprini cells confirmed the biological relevance of the biochemical data obtained in heterologous expression systems. To our knowledge, the use of alternative M(pro) autoprocessing sites has not been described previously for other nidovirus M(pro) domains. The data presented in this study lend further support to our previous conclusion that bafiniviruses represent a distinct group of viruses that significantly diverged from other phylogenetic clusters of the order Nidovirales.","Ulferts, Rachel; Mettenleiter, Thomas C; Ziebuhr, John",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01716-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21068254/,653
64051,Imbalance between procoagulant factors and natural coagulation inhibitors contributes to hypercoagulability in the critically ill COVID-19 patient: clinical implications.,2020-09-01,"The invariable governmental approach to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been to effect the White Knight stance of Don Quixote, defending the population from the ""Virus Dragon"" and dedicating its knight-errantry to the damsel Dulcinea. Though essential, new therapeutics, vaccines, physical distancing, rigorous hygiene standards and efficient health systems are not sufficient to counter the effects of the virus. Individual compliance to public health guidelines also matters, while remaining similarly insufficient to diminish the threat. Earthier, citizen-led, community participation strategies, however, lead to innovative, tailored solutions that better fulfil the needs of diverse neighbourhoods and assures greater virus resistance and increase in population health compared to a top-down, knightly approach or isolated individual efforts. The challenge of COVID-19 offers communities a moment to build more resilient, antifragile communities that not only survive the current crisis, but that thrive after it, and that are better equipped for the next challenge. This is not the time for the singular heroics of the White Knight, or the antics of Don Quixote, tilting at windmills. It is the time of Sancho Panza, which is to say of regular non-credentialed citizens, and their collective efforts, who up to now have largely been considered pawns in this contest. Asset-based community development (ABCD) rejects both the individual as an island and the institutional, knightly emphasis on assessing needs and deficits within communities. It favours identifying and mobilising available and latent assets within a community to forge closer connections among all people, the better to collectivise problem-solving efforts. Community-driven initiatives are assisted in this by localised not-for-profit agencies that practice subsidiarity.","Russell, Cormac",Gaceta sanitaria,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaceta.2021.01.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33589295/,653

All data were registered prospectively in cooperation with the Institute of Quality Assurance in Surgery at the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg. METHODS The data were collected from an online data bank. Data collection began in 2005 for gastric banding (GB) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) results. In addition to primary bariatric operations, data regarding the complications of revision procedures and redo operations were analyzed. Participation in the quality assurance study was required for all certified centers in Germany. RESULTS RYGBs are a popular redo operation after failed gastric banding. In the German Bariatric Surgery Registry (GBSR), we analyzed data from 263 RYGB operations that used a one-step approach after GB and 116 operations that used a two-step approach. The leakage rates for primary RYGB decreased to 1.8%. The incidence of leakage after a one-step RYGB after GB was lower (1.9%) than after the two-step procedure (2.6%). CONCLUSION RYGBs are popular procedures after failed GB in Germany. The multivariable analysis for overall intraoperative complications revealed a significant difference between the two-step and the one-step procedure. In an unadjusted and multivariate assessment, the one-step procedure had statistically lower general postoperative complications than the two-step approach. Therefore, we suggest performing band removal and RYGB as a one-step procedure. Further analysis is necessary to evaluate the risk factors for the one-step procedure. Follow-up investigations must be performed to determine whether RYGB is an effective and safe option after GB.","Stroh, Christine; Weiner, R; Wolff, S; Lerche, C; Knoll, C; Keller, Th; Bruns, C; Manger, Th",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-014-1527-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25502287/,653

MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-one client-owned dogs with apparently unilateral perineal hernia were included. Perineal hernias were repaired bilaterally, incorporating internal obturator muscle transposition and the sacro-tuberal ligament, combined with colopexy, vas deferens pexy with or without cystopexy. Preoperative pattern of defaecation, pattern of micturition and rectal alignment were recorded. Surgical time, bilateral surgical perineal findings, postoperative complications, short-, middle- and long-term (>24 months) scores and recurrence rate were documented. RESULTS A hernia with ectopic tissue and weakness of the pelvic diaphragm was identified bilaterally in all dogs despite the unilateral clinical presentation. The procedure combination was achieved uneventfully in all dogs in 56 to 113 minutes (mean 73 minutes). Complication rate was low, consisting mostly of urinary disorders, most of which resolved within a few days. In all, 93% of dogs were free of clinical signs related to perineal hernia at long-term follow-up (mean 27 months). Recurrence rate was 0%. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Our surgical findings suggest that perineal hernia in dogs might be considered a bilateral disease, even when the presentation is of apparently unilateral signs. Recurrence is rare following bilateral herniorrhaphy combined with colopexy and deferens pexy with or without cystopexy.","Bernardé, A; Rochereau, P; Matres-Lorenzo, L; Brissot, H",The Journal of small animal practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/jsap.12920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30259995/,653

68110,Just one more hygiene practice in COVID-19.,2020-04-01,"BACKGROUND Little evidence exists to guide educators in the best way to implement simulation within surgical skills curricula. This study investigated whether practicing a basic Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) simulator task [peg transfer (PT)] facilitates learning a more complex skill [intracorporeal suturing (ICS)] and compared the effect of PT training to mastery with training to the passing level on PT retention and on learning ICS. METHODS For this study, 98 surgically naïve subjects were randomized to one of three PT training groups: control, standard training, and overtraining. All the participants then trained in ICS. The learning curves for ICS were analyzed by estimating the learning plateau and rate using nonlinear regression. Skill retention was assessed by retesting participants 1 month after training. The groups were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Effectiveness of skill transfer was calculated using the transfer effectiveness ratio (TER). Data are presented as mean±standard deviation (p<0.05). RESULTS The study was completed by 77 participants (28 control, 26 standard, and 23 overtrained subjects). The ICS learning plateau rose with increasing PT training (452±10 vs. 459±10 vs. 467±10; p<0.01). Increased PT training was associated with a trend toward higher initial ICS scores (128±107 vs. 127±110 vs. 183±106; p=0.13) and faster learning rates (15±4 vs. 14±4 vs. 13±4 trials; p=0.10). At retention, there were no differences in PT scores (p=0.5). The PT training took 20±10 min for standard training and 39±20 min for overtraining (p<0.01). Overtrained participants saved 11±5 min in ICS training compared with the control subjects (p=0.04). However, TER was 0.165 for the overtraining group and 0.160 for the standard training group, suggesting that PT overtraining took longer than the time saved on ICS training. CONCLUSION For surgically naïve subjects, part-task training with PT alone was associated with slight improvements in the learning curve for ICS. However, overtraining with PT did not improve skill retention, and peg training alone was not an efficient strategy for learning ICS.","Kolozsvari, Nicoleta O; Kaneva, Pepa; Brace, Chantalle; Chartrand, Genevieve; Vaillancourt, Marilou; Cao, Jiguo; Banaszek, Daniel; Demyttenaere, Sebastian; Vassiliou, Melina C; Fried, Gerald M; Feldman, Liane S",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1743-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21614665/,653
68772,Lethality rate of the two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy.,2021-01-01,"Opioids are commonly administered in the emergency department (ED) and prescribed for the treatment of back pain. It is important to understand the unintended consequences of this approach to inform treatment decisions and the consideration of alternative treatments. Recent evidence has shown that ED opioid prescriptions are associated with future opioid use. The objective of this study was to measure the association of opioid administration in the ED to patients treated for back pain with future opioid use. METHODS This is a retrospective study of opioid naïve adults discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of back pain. Patients were stratified by opioid therapy (none, ED administration only, prescription only, or ED administration + prescription). Relative risks of ongoing opioid use (filling >90-day supply in 180 days following ED visit as documented in the prescription drug monitoring program) were calculated for each opioid therapy group and compared to no the no opioid group. RESULTS We identified 24,487 opioid naïve back pain patients.. The median age was 38 years, 55% were female and 56% were non-Hispanic white. 41% received no opioid, 10% were only administered an ED opioid, 18% only received a prescription, and 31% received an ED opioid + prescription. The adjusted relative risks of ongoing use compared to the no opioid group were: ED only 1.9, prescription only 2.1, ED+ prescription 2.3. The increased risk persisted for other definitions of ongoing use and after adjustment for baseline pain scores. CONCLUSIONS For opioid naïve patients with back pain, both ED opioid administration and opioid prescriptions are associated with a doubling of the risk of ongoing opioid use compared to patients not treated with opioids. This supports the consideration of minimizing exposure to opioids while treating back pain in the ED.","Heard, Kennon; Ledbetter, Caroline; Hoppe, Jason",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.14071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609923/,653

73454,"Clinical features, laboratory findings and predictors of death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Sardinia, Italy.",2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The importance of time in acute stroke is well-established. Using the Interventional Management of Stroke III trial data, we explored the effect of multimodal imaging (CT perfusion and/or CT angiography) versus noncontrast CT alone on time to treatment and outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS We examined 3 groups: 1) subjects with baseline CTP and CTA (CTP+CTA), 2) subjects with baseline CTA without CTP (CTA), and 3) subjects with noncontrast head CT alone. The demographics, treatment time intervals, and clinical outcomes in these groups were studied. RESULTS Of 656 subjects enrolled in the Interventional Management of Stroke III trial, 90 (13.7%) received CTP and CTA, 216 (32.9%) received CTA (without CTP), and 342 (52.1%) received NCCT alone. Median times for the CTP+CTA, CTA, and NCCT groups were as follows: stroke onset to IV tPA (120.5 versus 117.5 versus 120 minutes; P = .5762), IV tPA to groin puncture (77.5 versus 81 versus 91 minutes; P = .0043), groin puncture to endovascular therapy start (30 versus 38 versus 44 minutes; P = .0001), and endovascular therapy start to end (63 versus 46 versus 74 minutes; P < .0001). Compared with NCCT, the CTA group had better outcomes in the endovascular arm (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.36-3.31; adjusted for age, NIHSS score, and time from onset to IV tPA). The CTP+CTA group did not have better outcomes compared with the NCCT group. CONCLUSIONS Use of CTA with or without CTP did not delay IV tPA or endovascular therapy compared with NCCT in the Interventional Management of Stroke III trial.","Vagal, A; Foster, L D; Menon, B; Livorine, A; Shi, J; Qazi, E; Yeatts, S D; Demchuk, A M; Hill, M D; Tomsick, T A; Goyal, M",AJNR.

74331,Could glutathione depletion be the Trojan horse of COVID-19 mortality?,2020-12-01,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic, resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality. Tocilizumab, an inhibitor of IL-6, has been widely repurposed as a treatment of severely ill patients without robust evidence supporting its use. In this study, we aimed to systematically describe the effectiveness of treatment and prevention of the cytokine storms in COVID-19 patients with tocilizumab. In this multicentered retrospective and observational cohort study, 65 patients with COVID-19 receiving tocilizumab and 130 not receiving tocilizumab were propensity score matched at a ratio of 2:1 based on age, sex, and comorbidities from January 20, 2020 to March 18, 2020 in Wuhan, China. After adjusting for confounding, the detected risk for in-hospital death was lower in the tocilizumab group versus nontocilizumab group (hazard ratio = 0.47; 95% confidence interval = 0.25-0.90; p = 0.023). Moreover, use of tocilizumab was associated with a lower risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (odds ratio = 0.23; 95% confidence interval = 0.11-0.45; p < 0.0001). Furthermore, patients had heightened inflammation and more dysregulated immune cells before treatment, which might aggravate disease progression. After tocilizumab administration, abnormally elevated IL-6, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and activated partial thromboplastin time decreased. Tocilizumab may be of value in prolonging survival in patients with severe COVID-19, which provided a novel strategy for COVID-19-induced cytokine release syndrome. Our findings could inform bedside decisions until data from randomized, controlled clinical trials become available.","Tian, Jianbo; Zhang, Ming; Jin, Meng; Zhang, Fengqin; Chu, Qian; Wang, Xiaoyang; Chen, Can; Yue, Huihui; Zhang, Li; Du, Ronghui; Zhao, Dong; Zeng, Zhaofu; Zhao, Yang; Liu, Kui; Wang, Mengmei; Hu, Ke; Miao, Xiaoping; Zhang, Huilan",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2000981; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33298617/,653

Travel bans-herein defined as the complete restriction of travel from at least one geographic region to at least one other international geographic region-are a potential policy solution to control the global spread of disease. The social, economic, and health-related consequences of travel bans, as well as the available evidence on the effectiveness of travel restrictions in preventing the global spread of influenza, have been previously described. However, the effectiveness of travel bans in reducing the spread of noninfluenza EIDs, characterized by different rates and modes of transmission, is less well understood. This study employs an integrative review approach to summarize the minimal evidence on effectiveness of travel bans to decrease the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola virus disease (EVD), and Zika virus disease (ZVD). We describe and qualify the evidence presented in six modeling studies that assess the effectiveness of travel bans in controlling these noninfluenza EID events. We conclude that there is an urgent need for additional research to inform policy decisions on the use of travel bans and other control measures to control noninfluenza EIDs in advance of the next outbreak.","Errett, Nicole A; Sauer, Lauren M; Rutkow, Lainie",American journal of disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.5055/ajdm.2019.0331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32421851/,653

PATIENTS AND METHODS This observational, descriptive, medical records review study was performed on patients with MIS-C admitted to the PICU between September 1 and November 1, 2020. Through medical records review, we confirmed that patients were positive for current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection or for COVID-19 exposure history within the 4 weeks before the onset of symptoms. RESULTS A total of 33 patients with severe MIS-C were included (21 male) with a median age of 9 years. The most common signs and symptoms during disease course were fever (100%) and abdominal pain (75.5%). Clinical features of 63.6% patients were consistent with Kawasaki disease/Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, and 36.4% were consistent with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome. Myocardial dysfunction and/or coronary artery abnormalities were detected in 18 patients during the PICU stay. Intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids were given to 33 patients. Anakinra was administered to 23 patients (69.6%). There was a significant increase in lymphocyte and platelet counts and a significant decrease in ferritin, B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin levels at the end of the first week of treatment in patients who were given biological therapy. Two patients were switched to tocilizumab because of an insufficient response to anakinra. The mortality rate of MIS-C patients admitted in PICU was 6.0%. CONCLUSIONS Management of systemic inflammation and shock is important to decrease mortality and the development of persistent cardiac dysfunction in MIS-C. The aggressive treatment approach, including biological agents, may be required in patients with severe symptoms and cardiac dysfunction.","Çelikel, Elif; Tekin, Zahide Ekici; Aydin, Fatma; Emeksiz, Serhat; Uyar, Emel; Özcan, Serhan; Perk, Oktay; Sezer, Müge; Tekgöz, Nilüfer; Coşkun, Serkan; Güngörer, Vildan; Gül, Ayşe Esin Kibar; Bayhan, Gülsüm İclal; Özbek, Namik; Azili, Müjdem Nur; Acar, Banu Çelikel",Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/rhu.0000000000001734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33843774/,653

The yak was noted to be healthy at presentation. Both ovaries were removed using a laparoscopic approach as follows: after induction and maintenance of general inhalant anesthesia, 15 degrees Trendelenburg positioning was required to view the ovaries. Ovariectomy was conducted within a surgical time of 50 minutes. Due to the small ovarian size, portal enlargement was not necessary for removal. Mild hemorrhage from the left ovarian pedicle was controlled with application of a vessel-sealing device. Postoperative complications were not encountered during hospitalization. At 12 months following surgery, the yak was healthy, and the owner was highly satisfied with the procedure. The described approach was successful for performing laparoscopic ovariectomy in a juvenile yak. Positioning for surgery was similar to other small ruminant species. Further case enrollment is needed to optimize the surgical approach and better describe clinical outcomes.","Koch, Drew W; Simpson, Katharine M; Easley, Jeremiah T; Hackett, Eileen S",Case reports in veterinary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8886670; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33204572/,653

Although HCoV is highly prevalent in the world, studies of the genomic and antigenic details of circulating HCoV strains have been limited. In this study, we compared four Japanese isolates with the standard HCoV-229E strain obtained from ATCC (ATCC-VR740) by focusing on the spike (S) protein, a major determinant of neutralizing antigen and pathogenicity. The isolates were found to have nucleotide deletions and a number of sequence differences in the S1 region of the S protein. We compared two of the Japanese isolates with the ATCC-VR740 strain by using virus-neutralizing assays consisting of infectious HCoV-229E particles and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-pseudotyped virus carrying the HCoV-229E S protein. The two clinical isolates (Sendai-H/1121/04 and Niigata/01/08) did not react with antiserum to the ATCC-VR740 strain via the neutralizing test. We then constructed a pseudotype VSV-harboured chimeric S protein with the ATCC S1 and Sendai S2 regions or that with Sendai S1 and ATCC S2 regions and compared them by a neutralization test. The results revealed that the difference in the neutralizing antigenicity depends on the S1 region. This different antigenic phenotype was also confirmed by a neutralizing test with clinically isolated human sera. These results suggest that the HCoV-229E viruses prevalent in Japan are quite different from the laboratory strain ATCC-VR740 in terms of the S sequence and neutralization antigenicity, which is attributed to the difference in the S1 region.","Shirato, Kazuya; Kawase, Miyuki; Watanabe, Oshi; Hirokawa, Chika; Matsuyama, Shutoku; Nishimura, Hidekazu; Taguchi, Fumihiro",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.043117-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22673931/,653

METHODOLOGY Five hundred suspected COVID-19 cases referred for high resolution computed tomography - chest were included in the study. Cases were categorised by radiological findings using COVID-19 pneumonia imaging classification, proposed in the radiological society of North America expert consensus statement on reporting chest CT findings related to COVID-19. CT-SS was calculated for all scans. Patients were clinically classified according to disease severity as per 'Diagnosis And Treatment Program of Pneumonia of New Coronavirus Infection' recommended by China's National Health Commission. The relationships between radiological findings, CT-SS, and clinical severity were explored. RESULTS Based on the radiological findings, 298 cases were graded as typical, 34 as indeterminate, 15 as atypical, and 153 as negative for pneumonia. The apical and posterior basal segments of lower lobes were most commonly involved. The CT-SS showed higher values in patients of severe group as compared to those in moderate group (p < 0.05).

The shear modulus of plantar flexors [gastrocnemius medialis (three locations), gastrocnemius lateralis (three locations), soleus (two locations), flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus), peroneus longus] and dorsiflexors (tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus) was measured using ultrasound shear wave elastography during passive dorsiflexions (2°/s). At the same ankle angle, stroke survivors displayed higher shear modulus than controls for gastrocnemius medialis and gastrocnemius lateralis (knee extended) and soleus (knee flexed). Very low shear modulus was found for the other muscles. The adjustment for muscle slack angle suggested that the increased shear modulus was arising from consequences of contractures. The stiffness distribution between muscles was consistent across participants with the highest shear modulus reported for the most distal regions of gastrocnemius medialis (knee extended) and soleus (knee flexed). These results provide a better appreciation of stiffness locations among plantar flexors of stroke survivors and can provide evidence for the implementation of clinical trials to evaluate targeted interventions applied on these specific muscle regions. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The shear modulus of 13 muscle regions was assessed in stroke patients using elastography. When compared with controls, shear modulus was increased in the gastrocnemius muscle (GM) when the knee was extended and in the soleus (SOL) when the knee was flexed. The distal regions of GM and SOL were the most affected. These changes were consistent in all the stroke patients, suggesting that the regions are a potential source of the increase in joint stiffness.","Le Sant, Guillaume; Nordez, Antoine; Hug, François; Andrade, Ricardo; Lecharte, Thomas; McNair, Peter J; Gross, Raphaël",Journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00968.2017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30236050/,653

No calibration is mandatory for these devices. The aim of this study was to describe the level of conformity of various cuff pressure gauges. The single-center measurements were performed with a cuff pressure calibrator on all cuff pressure gauges that were usually used in the operating room. Seven measurements (repeat three times) on each cuff pressure gauges at different levels of pressures (i.e. 0, 10, 20, 27, 30, 40 and 50 cmH2O) were performed. Our homologation criteria were either the reliability of the leak test (value of cuff pressure gauges maintained at 120 cmH2O during 5 s) or the difference between the values of the cuff pressure tested and the calibrator below 1.3 cmH2O at the range of 20-30 cmH2O. A total of 567 measurements on 27 cuff pressure gauges were performed. Only 30% (n = 8/27) of the cuff pressure gauges reach our homologation criteria. 30% (n = 8/27) failed at the leak test. 48% (n = 13/27) of the cuff pressure gauges tested, had a calibration variation error > 1.3 cmH2O on the levels of pressure between 20 and 30 cmH2O. A minority of cuff pressure gauges went through our homologation criteria. These results demonstrate us that there is a real problem of the reliability and the follow-up of those medical devices. This study suggests to reinforce biomedical engineering control on these devices.","Raft, Julien; Lamotte, Anne-Sophie; Maury, Bruno; Clerc-Urmès, Isabelle; Baumann, Cédric; Richebé, Philippe; Bouaziz, Hervé",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-018-0188-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30062655/,653
98813,Current practice and potential strategy in diagnosing COVID-19.,2020-04-01,"Multiple host proteins affect the gene expression of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) during latent and lytic replication. The high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) serves as a highly conserved chromosomal protein inside the cell and a prototypical damage-associated molecular pattern molecule outside the cell. HMGB1 has been shown to play a pathogenic role in viral infectious diseases and to regulate the lytic replication of KSHV. However, its functional effects on the KSHV life cycle in KSHV-infected cells have not been fully elucidated. Here, we explored the role of the intracellular and extracellular HMGB1 in KSHV virion production by employing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HMGB1 knockout in the KSHV-producing iSLK BAC16 cell line. Intracellular HMGB1 formed complexes with various proteins, and the abundance of HMGB1-interacting proteins changed during latent and lytic replication. Moreover, extracellular HMGB1 was found to enhance lytic replication by phosphorylating JNK. Of note, the expression of viral genes was attenuated during lytic replication in HMGB1-knockout iSLK BAC16 cells, with significantly decreased production of infectious virions compared to that in wild-type cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate that HMGB1 is an important cellular cofactor that affects the generation of infectious KSHV progeny during lytic replication. Author Summary The high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) has many intra- and extracellular biological functions with an intricate role in various diseases. In certain viral infections, HMGB1 affects the viral life cycle and pathogenesis. In this study, we explored the effects of HMGB1 knockout on the production of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). HMGB1 knockout decreased virion production in KSHV-producing cells by decreasing the expression of viral genes. The processes by which HMGB1 affects KSHV production may occur inside or outside of infected cells. For instance, several cellular and viral proteins interacted with intracellular HMGB1 in a nucleosomal complex; whereas extracellular HMGB1 induced JNK phosphorylation, thus enhancing lytic replication. Our results suggest that both intracellular and extracellular HMGB1 are necessary for efficient KSHV replication. Thus, HMGB1 may represent an effective therapeutic target for the regulation of KSHV production.","Kang, Su-Kyung; Kang, Yun Hee; Yoo, Seung-Min; Park, Changhoon; Kim, Hong Seok; Lee, Myung-Shin",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00799-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34105998/,653

100460,Are Italy and Iran really suffering from COVID-19 epidemic? A controversial study.,2020-04-01,"PURPOSE Inhibition of Notch signaling has been recently demonstrated to promote beige adipocyte biogenesis. However, most γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) used to achieve pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling are at the basic research or preclinical stage, limiting the translation of fundamental findings into clinical practice. This present study aimed to evaluate the potential of several clinical candidates of GSIs as browning agents for the treatment of obesity. METHODS Seven GSIs that are clinical candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease or cancer were selected and their impacts on Notch inhibition as well as promoting beige biogenesis were compared using in vitro culture of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. RESULTS Four compounds (i.e.RO4929097, PF-03084014, LY3039478, and BMS-906024) that efficiently inhibited the expression of Notch target genes in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were identified. Moreover, these compounds were optimized for dose-dependent effects at three gradient concentrations (0.5, 1, and 10 μM) to promote beige adipogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes without causing severe cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS Our findings not only highlight the potential of cross-therapeutic application of these GSIs for obesity treatment via inhibition of γ-secretase-mediated processing of Notch signaling, but also provide important experimental evidence to support further design and development of clinically translatable Notch-inhibiting drug delivery systems.","Huang, Di; Qiu, Jiamin; Kuang, Shihuan; Deng, Meng",Pharmaceutical research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11095-020-02916-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888109/,653

However, the technical performance of each SCP is strongly dependent on the surgeon's own discretion and comparison of clinical outcomes with respect to urinary incontinence (UI) is difficult. We developed a comprehensible laparoscopic surgical technique for the treatment of apical prolapse with UI. METHODS A total of 120 women with UI underwent laparoscopic bilateral SCP for apical prolapse. Thereby, the uterosacral ligaments (USLs) were bilaterally replaced by polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) tapes of identical length and shape, which were fixed at defined anatomical landmarks (cervix/vaginal vault and S1). RESULTS The restoration of apical vaginal support was achieved in 116 patients (97%); restoration failed in the first 4 patients owing to the use of fast-absorbable sutures. Seventy-eight patients (65%) with mixed and urgency UI symptoms before surgery achieved continence. The mean hospitalization was 3 days; no major complications were observed intraoperatively. CONCLUSION The advantage of laparoscopic cervicosacropexy (laCESA) and laparoscopic vaginosacropexy (laVASA) lies in the comprehensible surgical technique (clearly defined technique) and the minimal amount of material used (no polypropylenes). The possibility of a short operating time and short hospitalization depicts this laparoscopic bilateral USL replacement as one treatment alternative in patients with apical prolapse suffering from UI.","Rexhepi, Sokol; Rexhepi, Entela; Stumm, Martin; Mallmann, Peter; Ludwig, Sebastian",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2018.0474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30244596/,653

The restrictions imposed across countries on the movement of people and the realignment of health care services in response to the pandemic are likely to negatively affect the health status and delivery of mental health services to persons with dual disorders (PWDD). Methods: An online survey was conducted among mental health professionals involved in providing care to PWDD to better understand the problems encountered and identify potential solutions in providing continued treatment for PWDD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The findings confirmed significant disruption in the delivery of treatment services for PWDD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dissatisfaction with personal protective equipment, inadequate COVID-19 testing services at treatment facility, and lack of guidelines on providing continued treatment services to PWDD by national authorities or professional bodies were identified as the likely reasons for this disruption. Conclusions: These concerns in turn need to be addressed by the policy-makers, hospital management staff, and other stakeholders. Specifically, there should be a focus on developing and disseminating guidelines to assist mental health professionals in setting-up and providing continued treatment services to PWDD via tele-psychiatry and other novel digital strategies.","Singh Balhara, Yatan Pal; Szerman, Nestor; Singh, Swarndeep; Martinez Raga, Jose; Salom, Caroline; Peris, Lola; Ganesh, Ragul",Journal of dual diagnosis,https://doi.org/10.1080/15504263.2021.1940413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34165030/,653

This study searched for articles in PUBMED, CINAHL, Medline, EM-BASE, and Cochrane, and identified 3486 unique articles. These articles were screened based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Seven articles addressing time to normalization of either CTX, PINP, osteocalcin, or bone-specific alkaline phosphatase after a recent fracture were identified and these were analyzed qualitatively. CTX appeared to return to baseline within 6 months. PINP appeared to return to baseline within 6 months and interestingly dip below baseline after a year. Osteocalcin was elevated throughout the first year after a fracture, with most changes in the first 6 months. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) was increased for up to a year, however with a discrepancy between used assays. Seven studies were identified, showing CTX and PINP to return to baseline within 6 months. OC was elevated for 12 months. BAP was increased for up to a year. However, none of these studies had fasting patients and a long follow-up period with regular measurements. The studies could indicate that the BTM CTX and PINP have returned to baseline within 6 months; however, further studies are needed assessing pre-analytical factors while having a long follow-up. Bone turnover markers appear as good as or better than bone mineral density in monitoring the effect of anti-resorptive medication in osteoporosis. This study tries to identify the time from fracture until BTM are back at baseline. Most studies did not however take pre-analytical variation into consideration.

The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate a sensitive and controversial topic: the perspectives of healthcare staff about the presence and impacts of implicit bias in the Hungarian healthcare system towards Roma patients. Therefore, between June 2017 and May 2018 semi-structured interviews were conducted involving 13 healthcare professionals. Interview transcripts were coded and thematically analysed. The presence and occasional manifestation of prejudices against the Romas were noted by the interviewees, most commonly in the form of longer waiting time, comments or other meta-communicative tools. Study participants appeared to exclude a direct relationship between health providers' implicit bias and the lower quality of health services or the worse health status of Roma patients. However, as reported, indirect negative effects may occur in cases where a patient refrains from seeking care due to previous perceived or experienced discrimination. As barriers to effective patient-provider communication and cooperation, differences in culture, health-seeking behaviour and gaps between health literacy levels were emphasized. In terms of prevention, enhancing anti-discriminatory attitudes from early childhood within the families, the role of media in conveying unbiased information, increasing health awareness of the Roma people as well as educating healthcare providers on culture-related issues may be beneficial. Stress and burnout of healthcare professionals also need to be addressed as these may impact on the enactment of unconscious biases.","Marek, Erika; Nemeth, Timea; Orsos, Zsuzsa",Health promotion international,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daaa077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830249/,653

109489,Epidemiological analysis of 18 patients with COVID-19.,2020-12-01,"Impaired healing of the skin is a notable cause of patient morbidity and mortality. In diabetic individuals, dysregulated inflammation contributes to delayed wound healing. Specific immunomodulatory agents may have a role in the treatment of diabetic wounds. One of these molecules is interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra; Amgen Corp.). Although interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra; Amgen Corp.) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease, little is known about the local use this drug in cutaneous wound healing. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the effect of locally administered interleukin-1 receptor antagonist on delayed wound healing, specifically, in a diabetic mouse model. Two 6-mm full-thickness wounds were created on the dorsa of diabetic (db/db) mice and stented. One-hour postwounding, wound margins were subcutaneously injected with either (1) low-dose interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in a gelatin-transglutaminase gel vehicle or (2) the gel vehicle only. Wounds were imaged on days 0, 7, 14, and 21 postwounding, and wound area was determined. Wound biopsies were collected on day 21 and immunohistochemically stained for neutrophil and macrophage infiltration. Wounds treated with interleukin-1 receptor antagonist had significantly smaller wound area than nontreated wounds on day 7 and day 14 postwounding. Treated wounds also showed significantly less neutrophil and macrophage infiltration. These findings support the hypothesis that interleukin-1 receptor antagonist may have an important role in cutaneous wound healing, possibly by promoting successful resolution of acute inflammation and hence accelerating wound closure. Thereby, administration of IL-1Ra may be useful in the treatment of nonhealing wounds.","Perrault, David P; Bramos, Athanasios; Xu, Xingtian; Shi, Songtao; Wong, Alex K",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0000000000001417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29553981/,653

Among the 50 volatiles identified, 1-octen-3-ol, phenethyl alcohol, and several esters were considered key aromas because of their higher odor activity values. Eleven volatiles were screened as biomarkers by orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, and hierarchical cluster analysis showed that these biomarkers could represent all volatiles to distinguish the spore release stage. The activities of lipoxygenase (LOX), hydroperoxide lyase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and alcohol acyltransferase were higher in L. edodes with spore release. Moreover, linolenic acid and phenylalanine metabolism were involved in aroma biosynthesis. One LOX-related gene and five aryl alcohol dehydrogenase-related genes could regulate the biosynthesis of 1-octen-3-ol, phenethyl alcohol, and phenylacetaldehyde.

Ships are in an isolated environment, and most of the merchant ships do not carry medical personnel or medical supplies. Telemedicine offers a real possibility to provide reasonable quality medical assistance to seagoing vessels. The fact that ships may touch ports in affected areas, the difficulties for seafarers to be assisted ashore due to quarantine measures and the crews' lack of turnover make medical assistance at sea difficult. This study has compared maritime telemedical assistance data before and during the COVID-19 pandemic to propose prevention measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was based on the data from medical records of Centro Internazionale Radio Medico (C.I.R.M.) database of seafarers assisted from January 1 to June 30, in the years 2017-2020. The data were collected separately for each year. Age, sex, rank, and pathologies affecting the assisted seafarers were considered. Common signs of COVID-19 infection such as fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, and other respiratory symptoms were analysed. RESULTS From January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2019, C.I.R.M. assisted 15,888 patients on board ships. During the first 6 months of the years under evaluation, C.I.R.M. assisted 2,419 patients in 2017, 2,444 patients in 2018, 2,694 patients in 2019, and 3,924 in 2020. The number of assisted cases almost doubled in the first 6 months (from January to June) of 2020 compared to the same period of the previous years. Gastrointestinal disorders, injuries/traumas, and dermatological pathologies were the first, second, and third most often reported causes of illness on board over the 4-year study period. A higher number of seafarers with fever, cough, sore throat, and shortness of breath were assisted during the COVID-19 pandemic than before the coronavirus outbreak. Medical requests for fever increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period from 2017 to 2019. CONCLUSIONS The requests for medical advice for fever, sore throat, and shortness of breath were significantly more common during the coronavirus epidemic. Close follow-up, regular health education on preventing coronavirus transmission, personal protective equipment, adequate environmental hygiene, and applying other standard precautions could help minimise the risk factors for the spread of COVID-19.","Sagaro, Getu Gamo; Battineni, Gopi; Chintalapudi, Nalini; Di Canio, Marzio; Amenta, Francesco",International maritime health,https://doi.org/10.5603/imh.2020.0041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33394487/,653

However, scientific validation is vital to recommend spices as nutraceuticals or functional foods. In the present work, we have selected three spices based on Ayurvedic knowledge and developed a nutraceutical for immunomodulation. Trikatu, a blend of ginger, black pepper, and long pepper, is used in the Indian Ayurvedic system, along with many herbs, for various ailments. We formulated a ""Trikatu syrup"" (TS) using these three spices and palmyra palm neera. Carbon clearance assay, neutrophil adhesion test, and sheep red blood cell (SRBC)-induced delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction was performed to investigate the immunomodulatory potential of TS in Wistar Albino rats. The rats fed with TS showed a dose-dependent increase in footpad thickness compared to control rats, suggesting cell-mediated immunity. The major bioactive piperine in TS was isolated and quantified. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Spices are consumed worldwide as a flavor enhancer in food. Besides, spices have an array of bioactive molecules with a multitude of health benefits. In the backdrop of COVID-19, immunomodulation and antiviral properties of spices are discussed widely. The present study is intended to explore the potential of three selected spices (ginger, black pepper, and long pepper) beyond its application in typical food preparations.

For risk assessment and clinical decisions, predictive values are of interest. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the chance that a member of a relevant population who tests positive has been ill. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the chance that someone who tests negative has not been ill. The medical literature regularly reports sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is the chance that an ill person receives a positive test result. Specificity is the chance that a nonill person receives a negative result. Knowledge of sensitivity and specificity enables one to predict the test result given a person's illness status. These predictions are not directly relevant to patient care but, given knowledge of sensitivity and specificity, PPV and NPV can be derived if one knows the prevalence of the disease, the population rate of illness. There is considerable uncertainty about the prevalence of some diseases, a notable case being COVID-19. This paper addresses the problem of identification of PPV and NPV given knowledge of sensitivity and specificity and given bounds on prevalence. I explain the problem and show how to bound PPV and NPV as well as the risk ratio and difference, which are functions thereof. I apply the findings to COVID-19 antibody tests. I question the realism of supposing that sensitivity and specificity are known.","Manski, Charles F",Epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ede.0000000000001309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33394811/,653

These endovascular devices are placed within the parent artery rather than the aneurysm sac. They take advantage of altering hemodynamics at the aneurysm/parent vessel interface, resulting in gradual thrombosis of the aneurysm occurring over time. Subsequent inflammatory response, healing, and endothelial growth shrink the aneurysm and reconstruct the parent artery lumen while preserving perforators and side branches in most cases. Flow diverters have already allowed treatment of previously untreatable wide neck and giant aneurysms. There are risks with flow diverters including in-stent thrombosis, perianeurysmal edema, distant and delayed hemorrhages, and perforator occlusions. Comparative efficacy and safety against other therapies are being studied in ongoing trials. Antiplatelet therapy is mandatory with flow diverters, which has highlighted the need for better evidence for monitoring and tailoring antiplatelet therapy. In this paper we review the devices, their uses, associated complications, evidence base, and ongoing studies.","Alderazi, Yazan J; Shastri, Darshan; Kass-Hout, Tareq; Prestigiacomo, Charles J; Gandhi, Chirag D",Stroke research and treatment,https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/415653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24967131/,653
113359,Gastrointestinal symptoms and digestive comorbidities in an Italian cohort of patients with COVID-19.,2020-07-01,"Macromolecules are characterized by their particular arrangement of H bonds. Many of these interactions involve a single donor and acceptor pair, such as the regular H-bonding pattern between carbonyl oxygens and amide H(+)s four residues apart in α-helices. The H-bonding potential of some acceptors, however, leads to the phenomenon of overcoordination between two donors and one acceptor. Herein, using isotope-edited Fourier transform infrared measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we measured the strength of such bifurcated H bonds in a transmembrane α-helix. Frequency shifts of the (13)C=(18)O amide I mode were used as a reporter of the strength of the bifurcated H bond from a thiol and hydroxyl H(+) at residue i + 4. DFT calculations yielded very similar frequency shifts and an energy of -2.6 and -3.4 kcal/mol for the thiol and hydroxyl bifurcated H bonds, respectively. The strength of the intrahelical bifurcated H bond is consistent with its prevalence in hydrophobic environments and is shown to significantly impact side-chain rotamer distribution.","Feldblum, Esther S; Arkin, Isaiah T",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1319827111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24591597/,653

METHODS This is a retrospective study comprised of 185 eyes from 185 consecutive patients who underwent 23-gauge MIVS. The authors investigated the incidence and the clinical factors associated with conjunctival pigmentation, including indication of vitrectomy and surgical procedures. RESULTS Eight eyes (4.3%) from 185 eyes showed conjunctival pigmentation after surgery within 7 days postoperatively. Light microscopic examination of excised tissue showed infiltration of abundant dark brownish colored melanophages with surrounding scattered, finely granular, melanin pigments. C3F8 gas tamponade (OR, 9.4; 95% CI, 1.9-44.5; P=0.005) was significantly associated with conjunctival pigmentation. The mean surface area (21.26±2.21 mm(2)) of three eyes with C3F8 tamponade was significantly larger than that of five eyes (2.51±0.73 mm(2)) without tamponade (P=0.025). Neither leakage nor hypotony was found. CONCLUSIONS Intraocular melanin pigments could prolapse through the sclerotomy site and cause conjunctival pigmentation after 23-gauge MIVS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients undergoing anterior resection with a stapled anastomosis over a 2 year period were identified. Electronic and clinical records of these patients were reviewed. Unenhanced and/or enhanced MDCT was performed with intravenous and/or per-rectal contrast medium and read by a radiologist blinded to the patients' clinical details to determine the sensitivity and specificity of specific findings at MDCT for identifying leaks. RESULTS Seventeen percent (30/170) of the anterior resections were suspected to have an anastomotic leak. Ninety-three percent (28/30) of patients underwent MDCT. Seven point six percent (11+2/170) had a confirmed leak. Two patients underwent surgery without MDCT. A leak was confirmed by MDCT in 91% (10/11) of patients. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of MDCT in diagnosing a leak was 0.91, 1, 1, and 0.95, respectively. The sensitivity of peri-anastomotic air, peri-anastomotic collection, extravasation of rectal contrast medium, and staple line integrity was 0.81, 0.63, 0.54, and 0.72, respectively. Use of rectal contrast medium (8/11 cases) increased the subjective ease of diagnosis and was the only sign in one patient. CONCLUSIONS Presence of peri-anastomotic air is a reliable marker of anastomotic leaks at MDCT. Leakage of rectal contrast medium is highly accurate and increases confidence of diagnosis. The appearance of the staple line itself is not accurate in assessing anastomotic integrity.","Kaur, P; Karandikar, S S; Roy-Choudhury, S",Clinical radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2013.08.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24156793/,653

117114,The interplay between vitamin D and COVID-19: protective or bystander?,2021-02-01,"Hypertrophic scar and keloid are two types of fibroproliferative conditions that result from excessive extracellular matrix production. The underlying pathological mechanism is not entirely clear. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is associated with fibrosis in various organs. RAS components including angiotensin II (Ang II), angiotensin AT1 and AT2 receptors, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) are expressed in the skin and act independently from the plasma RAS. AT1 receptors, which are usually the dominating receptor subtype, promote fibrosis and scar formation, while AT2 receptors inhibit the aforementioned AT1 receptor-coupled effects. Elevated angiotensin II (Ang II) levels acting on the AT1 receptor contribute to skin scar formation through increased expression of inflammatory factors such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibrinogenic factors such as transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), while at the same time suppressing the anti-fibrotic tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMPs). First, small clinical trials have provided evidence that inhibition of the ACE/Ang II/ AT1 receptor axis may be effective in the treatment of hypertrophic scars/keloids. This review provides a detailed overview of the current literature on the RAS in skin, wound healing and scar formation and discusses the translational potential of targeting this hormonal system for treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids.","Hedayatyanfard, Keshvad; Haddadi, Nazgol-Sadat; Ziai, Seyed Ali; Karim, Hossein; Niazi, Feizollah; Steckelings, U Muscha; Habibi, Behnam; Modarressi, Ali; Dehpour, Ahmad Reza",Experimental dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/exd.14154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32678966/,653

Unlike human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), a receptor for MERS-CoV, mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) failed to support MERS-CoV infection. Consequently, diverse transgenic mouse models expressing hDPP4 have been developed using diverse methods, although some models show no mortality and/or only transient and mild-to-moderate clinical signs following MERS-CoV infection. Additionally, overexpressed hDPP4 is associated with neurological complications and breeding difficulties in some transgenic mice, resulting in impeding further studies. Here, we generated stable hDPP4-transgenic mice that were sufficiently susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. The transgenic mice showed weight loss, decreased pulmonary function, and increased mortality with minimal perturbation of overexpressed hDPP4 after MERS-CoV infection. In addition, we observed histopathological signs indicative of progressive pulmonary fibrosis, including thickened alveolar septa, infiltration of inflammatory monocytes, and macrophage polarization as well as elevated expression of profibrotic molecules and acute inflammatory response in the lung of MERS-CoV-infected hDPP4-transgenic mice. Collectively, we suggest that this hDPP4-transgenic mouse is useful to enable understanding of the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection and for antiviral research and vaccine development against the virus.","Kim, Ju; Yang, Ye Lin; Jeong, Yongsu; Jang, Yong-Suk",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.1910.10055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31838832/,653

METHOD Retrospective review of all adult asthma admissions to the Hospital CCC between 2000 and 2015. Demographic, physiological, treatment data and blood gas results were recorded. RESULTS There were 265 asthma admissions to Middlemore Hospital CCC during the study period. The median age was 34 years; 64% were female. NIV was used in 186 admissions, of which eight went on to require intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Twenty-three other admissions received IMV without a trial of NIV and a further 58 were managed with medical care only. The average pH for all admissions was 7.23 and the IMV group had an average pH of 6.99. Forty-five admissions presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of ≤10. Twenty-five of these were managed with NIV with only one requiring subsequent intubation. The mean duration of NIV in this group was 5 h (range 1-17 h) with a mean ICU and hospital length of stay of 17 h and 3.5 days, respectively. All patients in this group effectively lowered the pCO2 over a 2 h period with NIV having an average drop of 5.9 kPa and IMV 3.4 kPa. CONCLUSION The use of NIV appears to be safe and effective in patients with severe asthma, including selected patients with an altered level of consciousness. NIV was well tolerated with a low need for subsequent intubation.","Bond, Kirsten Rl; Horsley, Carl Ae; Williams, Anthony B",Emergency medicine Australasia : EMA,https://doi.org/10.1111/1742-6723.12876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29131536/,653

Its normally tight regulation is lost during infection by the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and thus, uncontrolled pyroptosis disrupts the immune system and the integrity of organs defining the critical conditions in patients with high viral load. Molecular pathways engaged downstream of the formation and stabilization of the inflammasome, which are necessary to execute the process, have been uncovered and drugs are available for their regulation. However, the pharmacology of the upstream events, which are critical to sense and interpret the initial damage by the pathogen, is far from being elucidated. This limits our capacity to identify early markers and targets to ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 linked pyroptosis. Here, we focus attention on the mitochondria and pathways leading to their dysfunction, in order to elucidate the early steps of inflammasome formation and devise tools to predict and counter pathological states induced by SARS-CoV-2.","Singh, Aarti; Strobbe, Daniela; Campanella, Michelangelo",British journal of pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.15670; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34632567/,653

Recently, a visual sputum suctioning system (VSSS) was developed, and we tested this new system in a laboratory setting. METHODS We used coagulant concentrations of 1.5% and 3.0% to simulate mucus and sputum. Conventional single-lumen and triple-lumen catheters were inserted separately into a beaker for sputum suctioning (15 s, 200 mm Hg). A micro-imaging fiber was integrated into the triple-lumen catheter to create the VSSS. The single-lumen catheter and the VSSS were inserted separately into the mouth cavity, the nasal cavity, the tracheostomy tube, and the endotracheal tube of a human analog model for further comparisons. RESULTS As the suction channel of the triple-lumen catheter was reduced by 46.8%, the amount of simulant it suctioned was significantly less than that suctioned by the single-lumen catheter. However, under real-time guidance, the VSSS suctioned more simulant than the conventional single-lumen catheter in the human analog model. CONCLUSION Sputum suctioning with the VSSS was feasible. Because of its real-time imaging guidance, the efficiency of the VSSS procedure was greater than that of the conventional single-lumen catheter. Therefore, this system may provide a new platform for sputum suctioning.","Lv, Jingjing; Wu, Jingxing; Guo, Rui; Liu, Xun; Yan, Bingbing; Deng, Huisheng",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.01982; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23533294/,653

Various techniques have been described to reconstruct surgical defects of the ala, including melolabial transposition flaps, interpolated melolabial flaps, bilobed and trilobed transposition flaps, island pedicle flaps and spiral flaps. Full-thickness skin grafts have received little attention in the reconstructive literature. OBJECTIVES We present our experience with full-thickness skin grafts for the reconstruction of partial thickness defects of the nasal ala in the largest series to date. METHODS A retrospective analysis of the Mohs micrographic surgery database over a 9-year period was performed. All cases of full-thickness skin grafts for reconstruction of the nasal ala were identified. Defect location, size and any postoperative complications were noted. All patients were reviewed at the time of suture removal, at 3 and 6 weeks postoperatively and at 1 year. RESULTS There were 186 cases in total in 181 patients (88 men and 93 women). Their ages ranged from 31 to 88 years with a mean of 65 years (median 66). Defect size varied from 0·3 × 0·4 cm to 2·0 × 2·7 cm, with the average defect size measuring 1·0-1·2 cm in diameter. Thirty-six per cent (67 of 186) of cases underwent postoperative dermabrasion, and 8% (14 of 186) received postoperative intralesional triamcinolone. The incidence of graft failure and infection was low. Good-to-excellent cosmetic results were seen in all patients and postoperative complications were uncommon and minor.

Significant efforts are being applied to the development of sample-delivery systems that allow these unique sources to be most efficiently exploited for high-throughput serial femtosecond crystallography. Here, the next iteration of a fixed-target crystallography chip designed for rapid and reliable delivery of up to 11 259 protein crystals with high spatial precision is presented. An experimental scheme for predetermining the positions of crystals in the chip by means of in situ spectroscopy using a fiducial system for rapid, precise alignment and registration of the crystal positions is presented. This delivers unprecedented performance in serial crystallography experiments at room temperature under atmospheric pressure, giving a raw hit rate approaching 100% with an effective indexing rate of approximately 50%, increasing the efficiency of beam usage and allowing the method to be applied to systems where the number of crystals is limited.","Oghbaey, Saeed; Sarracini, Antoine; Ginn, Helen M; Pare-Labrosse, Olivier; Kuo, Anling; Marx, Alexander; Epp, Sascha W; Sherrell, Darren A; Eger, Bryan T; Zhong, Yinpeng; Loch, Rolf; Mariani, Valerio; Alonso-Mori, Roberto; Nelson, Silke; Lemke, Henrik T; Owen, Robin L; Pearson, Arwen R; Stuart, David I; Ernst, Oliver P; Mueller-Werkmeister, Henrike M; Miller, R J Dwayne","Acta crystallographica.

We pooled data to investigate the efficacy and safety of stent thrombectomy using the Solitaire device in anterior circulation ischemic stroke. METHODS Patient-level data were pooled from trials in which the Solitaire was the only or the predominant device used in a prespecified meta-analysis (SEER Collaboration): Solitaire FR With the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment (SWIFT PRIME), Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation Proximal Occlusion With Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times (ESCAPE), Extending the Time for Thrombolysis in Emergency Neurological Deficits-Intra-Arterial (EXTEND-IA), and Randomized Trial of Revascularization With Solitaire FR Device Versus Best Medical Therapy in the Treatment of Acute Stroke Due to Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion Presenting Within Eight Hours of Symptom Onset (REVASCAT). The primary outcome was ordinal analysis of modified Rankin Score at 90 days. The primary analysis included all patients in the 4 trials with 2 sensitivity analyses: (1) excluding patients in whom Solitaire was not the first device used and (2) including the 3 Solitaire-only trials (excluding ESCAPE). Secondary outcomes included functional independence (modified Rankin Score 0-2), symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and mortality. RESULTS The primary analysis included 787 patients: 401 randomized to endovascular thrombectomy and 386 to standard care, and 82.6% received intravenous thrombolysis. The common odds ratio for modified Rankin Score improvement was 2.7 (2.0-3.5) with no heterogeneity in effect by age, sex, baseline stroke severity, extent of computed tomography changes, site of occlusion, or pretreatment with alteplase. The number needed to treat to reduce disability was 2.5 and for an extra patient to achieve independent outcome was 4.25 (3.29-5.99). Successful revascularization occurred in 77% treated with Solitaire device. The rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and overall mortality did not differ between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS Solitaire thrombectomy for large vessel ischemic stroke was safe and highly effective with substantially reduced disability. Benefits were consistent in all prespecified subgroups.","Campbell, Bruce C V; Hill, Michael D; Rubiera, Marta; Menon, Bijoy K; Demchuk, Andrew; Donnan, Geoffrey A; Roy, Daniel; Thornton, John; Dorado, Laura; Bonafe, Alain; Levy, Elad I; Diener, Hans-Christoph; Hernández-Pérez, María; Pereira, Vitor Mendes; Blasco, Jordi; Quesada, Helena; Rempel, Jeremy; Jahan, Reza; Davis, Stephen M; Stouch, Bruce C; Mitchell, Peter J; Jovin, Tudor G; Saver, Jeffrey L; Goyal, Mayank",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.115.012360; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26888532/,653

147526,"Cardiovascular, hematological and neurosensory impact of COVID-19 and variants.",2021-04-01,"Cyclophilin A (CyPA) is a ubiquitously distributed peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) that possesses diverse biological functions. Extracellular CyPA is a potent chemokine, which can directly induce leukocyte chemotaxis and contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammation-mediated diseases. Although it has been identified that the chemotaxis activity of CyPA is mediated through its cell surface signaling receptor CD147, the role of CyPA PPIase activity in this process is disputable, and the underlying molecular mechanism is still poorly understood. In this study, we present the first evidence that CyPA induces leukocyte chemotaxis through a direct binding with the ectodomain of CD147 (CD147(ECT)), independent of its PPIase activity. Although NMR study indicates that the CD147(ECT) binding site on CyPA overlaps with the PPIase active site, the PPIase inactive mutant CyPA(R55A) exhibits similar CD147(ECT) binding ability and chemotaxis activity to those of CyPA(WT). Furthermore, we have identified three key residues of CyPA involved in CD147(ECT) binding and found that mutations H70A, T107A, and R69A result in similar levels of reduction in CD147(ECT) binding ability and chemotaxis activity for CyPA, without affecting the PPIase activity. Our findings indicate that there exists a novel mechanism for CyPA to regulate cellular signaling processes, shedding new light on its applications in drug development and providing a new targeting site for drug design.","Song, Fei; Zhang, Xin; Ren, Xiao-Bai; Zhu, Ping; Xu, Jing; Wang, Li; Li, Yi-Fei; Zhong, Nan; Ru, Qiang; Zhang, Da-Wei; Jiang, Jian-Li; Xia, Bin; Chen, Zhi-Nan",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.c110.181347; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21245143/,653

The World Health Organization specifically recommends cough etiquette to prevent the spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but implementation is generally poor and evidence supporting its value is lacking. METHODS We constructed a model to assess 'real life' transmission risk by counting viable pathogens from aerosols produced by coughing patients, thus allowing the assessment of outward protection measures in a standardised fashion. During the validation process, we focused on rod-shaped bacteria as surrogates for M. tuberculosis. RESULTS The Cough Cylinder enabled us to sample Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and mycobacteria from aerosols produced by patients with cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia and tuberculosis. Pathogens in droplets and in airborne particles could be sampled. Delayed air sampling allowed specific measurement of persistent airborne particles. CONCLUSION This novel experimental system allows measurement of aerosol pathogen spread in a highly standardised fashion. It also offers the possibility to assess the impact of different interventions to limit aerosol transmission.","Vanden Driessche, K; Marais, B J; Wattenberg, M; Magis-Escurra, C; Reijers, M; Tuinman, I L; Boeree, M J; van Soolingen, D; de Groot, R; Cotton, M F",The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,https://doi.org/10.5588/ijtld.12.0289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23232004/,653

Studies in the past have either employed cellular β-actin (BACT) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as internal reference genes, although the stability of their expression in the context of Marek's disease virus (MDV) infection has never been investigated. In the present study, we compared the stability of five reference genes (BACT, 28S RNA, 18S RNA, GAPDH, Peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase B [PPIB], a.k.a. cyclophilin B) as standard internal controls in chicken embryo fibroblast (CEFs) cultures infected with either MD vaccine or oncogenic MDV1 viruses. We further extend these analyses to reference gene stability in spleen lymphomas induced by infection of commercial broiler chickens with a very virulent plus MDV1 (vv+ TK-2a virus). Two excel based algorithms, (Bestkeeper and Normfinder) were employed to compare reference gene stability. Bestkeeper and Normfinder analysis of reference gene stability in virus- and mock-infected cells, showed that 28S RNA and PPIB displayed higher stability in CEF infections with either oncogenic or vaccine viruses. In addition, both Bestkeeper and Normfinder determined 28S RNA and PPIB to be the most stably-expressed reference genes in vivo in vv+ TK-2a-induced spleen lymphomas. Furthermore, Bestkeeper and Normfinder analyses both determined BACT to be the least stable reference gene during MDV infection of CEF with oncogenic viruses, vaccine viruses, as well as in vv+ TK-2a-induced spleen lymphomas.","Neerukonda, Sabari Nath; Katneni, Upendra K; Golovan, Sergey; Parcells, Mark S",Journal of virological methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.07.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27448823/,653

As Israel has a diverse cultural-religious population, the sample included both Jewish and Arab women, allowing us to explore the differences between them. Furthermore, we examined the contribution of personal resources, both internal (self-mastery and resilience) and external (perceived social support), as well as the level of infection-related anxiety to the women's psychological distress. METHOD A convenience sample of 403 Israeli women (233 Jewish and 170 Arab) was recruited through social media. RESULTS Arab women reported significantly higher infection-related anxiety and psychological distress than Jewish women. In addition, Jewish women reported significantly higher self-mastery than Arab pregnant women. Finally, poorer health, being an Arab woman, and lower levels of self-mastery, resilience, and perceived social support, as well as a higher level of infection-related anxiety, contributed significantly to greater psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS The findings show that pregnant women in general may be at risk of psychological distress in times of crisis, and that minority populations in particular may be at greater risk than others. Moreover, the results highlight the contribution of women's personal and environmental resources in the face of crisis, an understanding that may be used in targeted interventions to reduce distress in vulnerable populations.","Chasson, Miriam; Taubman-Ben-Ari, Orit; Abu-Sharkia, Salam",Ethnicity & health,https://doi.org/10.1080/13557858.2020.1815000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32877202/,653

Methods: Doctoral-level neuropsychology practitioners were invited via numerous methods, with multiple reminders, to participate in a web-based survey from January 17 through April 2, 2020. The useable U.S. sample of 1677 doctoral-level practitioners was 6.2% larger than the comparable group in the prior 2015 practice survey. Results: Whereas women practitioners predominate, which continues a steeply increasing trend across time, increases in overall ethnic/racial diversity continue at a slow pace. Median age has remained very similar over the last 30 years, reflecting a continuous influx of young practitioners. A relatively small minority of neuropsychologists work part time. The proportion of board-certified neuropsychologists continues to show meaningful increase; interest in subspecialization certification is relatively high. Reliance on technicians remains popular, especially for neuropsychologists who work in institutions or are board certified. Although implementation of new CPT codes in 2019 and related payor policies appear to have had more negative than positive effects, psychology-related annual incomes of neuropsychologists have again increased compared to prior surveys. Variables such as specific work setting, state, region, years in practice, forensic practice hours, board certification, and basis for determining income (e.g. hours billed, revenue collected, relative value units) have an impact on income. More than half of practitioners engage in forensic neuropsychology, with the number of related practice hours per week again increasing. There is very high agreement regarding the use of response validity measures in clinical practice and forensic practice. Neurologists remain the number one referral source whether working in an institution, private practice, or a combination of both, and regardless of maintaining a pediatric, adult, or lifespan practice. Career satisfaction ratings for income, job, and work-life balance remain high, with the majority of ratings regarding the future of the specialty in the positive range. Additional data summaries related to a wide range of professional and practice topics are provided. Conclusions: Updating and comparing survey information at five-year intervals continues to provide insights and perspectives regarding relative stabilities and changes in practice activities, beliefs, and incomes of U.S. clinical neuropsychologists.

Group-AV patients were initiated on Oseltamivir without any antibiotic in treatment regimen while Group-AV+AZ patients were initiated on Oseltamivir and Azithromycin combination therapy for at least 3-5 days. Patients were evaluated for different clinical outcomes.Results: A total of 227 and 102 patients were identified for Group-AV and Group-AV+AZ respectively. The identified patients of both groups were mostly unvaccinated. Multivariate regression analysis showed that incidences of secondary bacterial infections were significantly less frequent (23.4% vs 10.4%; P-value=0.019) in Group-AV+AZ patients. Group-AV+AZ patients were associated with shorter length of hospitalization (6.58 vs 5.09 days; P-value=<0.0001) and less frequent incidences of respiratory support (38.3% vs 17.6%; P-value=0.016).

We used the database to visualize pandemic connectedness through the workflow of travel data collection, network construction, data aggregation, travel statistics calculation, and visualization with time-series plots and spatial-temporal maps. We observed similar patterns in the time-series plots of worldwide daily flights from January to early-March of 2019 and 2020. A sharp reduction in the number of daily flights recorded in mid-March 2020 was likely related to large-scale air travel restrictions owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. The levels of connectedness between places are strong indicators of the risk of a pandemic. Since the initial reports of COVID-19 cases worldwide, a high network density and reciprocity in early-March 2020 served as early signals of the COVID-19 pandemic and were associated with the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in mid-March 2020. The spatial-temporal map of connectedness in Europe on March 13, 2020, shows the highest level of connectedness among European countries, which reflected severe outbreaks of COVID-19 in late March and early April of 2020. As a quality control measure, we used the aggregated numbers of international flights from April to October 2020 to compare the number of international flights officially reported by the International Civil Aviation Organization with the data collected from the Collaborative Arrangement for the Prevention and Management of Public Health Events in Civil Aviation dashboard, and we observed high consistency between the 2 data sets. The flexible design of the database provides users access to network connectedness at different periods, places, and spatial levels through various network statistics calculation methods in accordance with their needs. The analysis can facilitate early recognition of the risk of a current communicable disease pandemic and newly emerging communicable diseases in the future.","Chu, Amanda My; Chan, Jacky Nl; Tsang, Jenny Ty; Tiwari, Agnes; So, Mike Kp",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,653
220930,Procalcitonin is a predictor of disseminated intravascular coagulation in patients with fatal COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE: Timing of surgery for orthopaedic injuries continues to evolve, as an improved understanding of biology, healing, and technological advances continues to challenge historical norms. With the growing COVID-19 pandemic stretching limited healthcare resources, postponing surgery becomes an inevitable and unenviable task for most orthopaedic surgeons, and a shift in outpatient paradigms is required to mitigate poor outcomes in patients. METHODS: A scoping review of five databases on surgical timing and orthopaedic soft-tissue injuries was performed. All randomized controlled trials, longitudinal cohort studies, retrospective case series, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and expert opinions were included for review, with 65 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Better outcomes appear to be associated with early surgery for subluxations (< 1 week), recurrent dislocations (> 2 episodes), ligamentous and tendinous injuries (< 2 weeks), and bony avulsion injuries (< 3 weeks). Spinal conditions with neurological compromise should be operated on within 24 hours and spinal instability within 72 hours to reduce the risk of complications and poor outcomes. CONCLUSION: Most soft-tissue orthopaedic injuries can be managed with outpatient ambulatory surgery in a semi-elective setting. As the paradigm for outpatient surgery shifts due to technological advances and the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical for surgeons to time their surgery appropriately to maintain the high standards of orthopaedic practice.","Ding, Benjamin Tze Keong; Decruz, Joshua; Kunnasegaran, Remesh",Int Orthop,,653

However, little is currently known about the potential for pre-existing resistance to RDV and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversification that might impact RDV efficacy as the virus continue to spread globally. In this study, >90,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from globally circulating clinical isolates, including sequences from recently emerged United Kingdom and South Africa variants, and >300 from mink isolates were analyzed for genetic diversity in the RNA replication complex (nsp7, nsp8, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14) with a focus on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the molecular target of RDV. Overall, low genetic variation was observed with only 12 amino acid substitutions present in the entire RNA replication complex in &#8805;0.5% of analyzed sequences with the highest overall frequency (82.2%) observed for nsp12 P323L that consistently increased over time. Low sequence variation in the RNA replication complex was also observed among the mink isolates. Importantly, the coronavirus Nsp12 mutations previously selected in vitro in the presence of RDV were identified in only 2 isolates (0.002%) within all the analyzed sequences. In addition, among the sequence variants observed in &#8805;0.5% clinical isolates, including P323L, none were located near the established polymerase active site or sites critical for the RDV mechanism of inhibition. In summary, the low diversity and high genetic stability of the RNA replication complex observed over time and in the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants suggests a minimal global risk of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 resistance to RDV.","Martin, Ross; Li, Jiani; Parvangada, Aiyappa; Perry, Jason; Cihlar, Tomas; Mo, Hongmei; Porter, Danielle; Svarovskaia, Evguenia",Antiviral Res,,653

Yet many corporate and financial leaders are increasingly focused on the urgent need to forestall far graver long-term risks by more firmly reorienting the economy toward a zero-carbon future. Despite the severity of the immediate health and economic crises, a growing number of top global companies are publicly committing to net-zero goals. Oil-and-gas giants BP and Shell recently took multibillion-dollar write-downs on their fossil fuel assets, a telling sign of a gathering energy transition, and BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has begun screening investments for their climate implications. Dozens of the world’s central bankers recently underscored the links between the two crises, calling the pandemic “a real-life stress test of what we could potentially experience in an increasingly unstable climate.” Enormous political and economic obstacles remain, and much hinges on the US election and the course of the pandemic. But the compelling economic case for climate action–both for near-term recovery and to avert profound long-term risks–could soon help create unprecedented openings for strong government action.","Diringer, Elliot; Perciasepe, Bob",Bull.

248070,Elevated energy requirement of cone photoreceptors,2020,"COVID-19 is a pandemic that began to spread worldwide caused by SARS-CoV-2. Lung cancer patients are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 enters into the host by the ACE2 receptor. Thus, ACE2 is the key to understand the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the lack of knowledge about the biomarker of COVID-19 warrants the development of ACE2 biomarkers. The analysis of ACE2 expression in lung cancer was performed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Therefore, we investigated the prognosis, clinical characteristics, and mutational analysis of lung cancer. We also analyzed the shared proteins between the COVID-19 and lung cancer, protein-protein interactions, gene-miRNAs, gene-transcription factors (TFs), and the signaling pathway. Finally, we compared the mRNA expression of ACE2 and its co-expressed proteins using the TCGA. The up-regulation of ACE2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC) was found irrespective of gender and age. We found the low survival rate in high expression of ACE2 in lung cancer patients and 16 mutational positions. The functional assessment of targeted 12,671, 3107, and 29 positive genes were found in COVID-19 disease, LUAD, and LUSC, respectively. Then, we identified eight common genes that interact with 20 genes, 219 miRNAs, and 16 TFs. The common genes performed the mRNA expression in lung cancer, which proved the ACE2 is the best potential biomarker compared to co-expressed genes. This study uncovers the relationship between COVID-19 disease and lung cancer. We identified ACE2 and also its co-expressed proteins are the potential biomarker and therapy as the current COVID-19 disease and lung cancer.","Samad, Abdus; Jafar, Tamanna; Rafi, Jahirul Hasnat",Genomics,,653

After over six-month spread of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 causes critical threats to global public health and economy. The investigations on evolution and genotyping on genetic variations are of great importance, therefore, the present study characterized the molecular variation of SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing 4230 complete genome sequences from the worldwide samples collected during the first 6-month pandemic. Phylogenetic tree analysis with Neighbor-Joining and Maximum-Parsimony methods indicated that the haplotypes of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were classified into four clades with the unique nucleotide and amino acid changes: T27879C (ORF8 L84S) in clade 1 (25.34%), A23138G (spike D614G) in clade 2 (63.54%), G10818T (nsp6 L37F), C14540T (nsp12 T442I), and G25879T (ORF3a V251F) in clade 3 (2.58%), and miscellaneous changes in clade 4 (8.54%). Interestingly, subclade 2B with the amino acid changes at nsp2 T85I, Spike D614G, and ORF3a Q57H was firstly reported on March 4, 2020 in United States of America, becoming the most frequent sub-haplogroup in the world (36.21%) and America (45.81%). Subclade 1C with the amino acid changes at nsp13 P504L and ORF8 L84S was becoming the second most frequent sub-haplogroup in the world (19.91%) and America (26.29%). Subclade 2A with the amino acid changes in Spike D614G and Nucleocapsid R203K and G204R was highly prevalent in Asia (18.82%) and Europe (29.72%). The study highlights the notable clades and sub-clades with unique mutations, revealing the genetic and geographical relevant post the six-month outbreak of COVID-19.

In this study we predict, using molecular docking, the binding affinity of 15 phenothiazines (antihistaminic and antipsychotic drugs) when interacting with the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we tested the binding affinity of photoproducts identified after irradiation of phenothiazines with Nd:YAG laser beam at 266 nm respectively 355 nm. Our results reveal that thioridazine and its identified photoproducts (mesoridazine and sulforidazine) have high biological activity on the virus Mpro. This shows that thioridazine and its two photoproducts might represent new potent medicines to be used for treatment in this outbreak. Such results recommend these medicines for further tests on cell cultures infected with SARS-CoV-2 or animal model. The transition to human subjects of the suggested treatment will be smooth due to the fact that the drugs are already available on the market.","Udrea, Ana-Maria; Avram, Speranta; Nistorescu, Simona; Pascu, Mihail-Lucian; Romanitan, Mihaela Oana",J Photochem Photobiol B,,653

Before this change, however, self-collection was used primarily for genital and anorectal infections, with only limited studies on the performance of self-collection of oropharyngeal swabs for oropharyngeal STI detection. The Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC) changed from clinician-collected to self-collected oropharyngeal swabs for oropharyngeal gonorrhea and chlamydia screening on 16 March 2020 in order to reduce health care worker risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared the proportions of valid and positive samples for gonorrhea and chlamydia among men who have sex with men (MSM) in two time periods; the clinician collection period, between 20 January and 15 March 2020, and the self-collection period, between 16 March and 8 May 2020. A total of 4,097 oropharyngeal swabs were included. The proportion of oropharyngeal swabs with equivocal or invalid results for Neisseria gonorrhoeae was higher in the self-collection period (1.6% [24/1,497]) than in the clinician collection period (0.9% [23/2,600]) (P = 0.038), but the proportions did not differ for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis The positivity rates of oropharyngeal N. gonorrhoeae (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR], 1.07 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.85 to 1.34]) (P = 0.583) and oropharyngeal C. trachomatis (adjusted PR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.51 to 1.39]) (P = 0.504) specimens did not differ between the two periods.

We measured trends in firearm injuries in children and inflicted by children discharging a firearm during the pandemic and correlated these changes with a rise in firearm acquisition. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study with an interrupted time series analysis, we used multiyear data from the Gun Violence Archive. We compared trends in (1) firearm injuries in children younger than 12 years old and (2) firearm injuries inflicted by children younger than 12 years old during the pre-COVID-19 period (March to August in the years 2016-2019) and during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to August 2020). Linear regression models were developed to evaluate the relationship between firearm injuries and new firearm acquisitions. RESULTS: There was an increased risk of (1) firearm injuries in young children (relative risk = 1.90; 95% confidence interval 1.58 to 2.29) and (2) firearm injuries inflicted by young children (relative risk = 1.43; 95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.80) during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the pre-COVID-19 study period. These increased incidents correlate with an increase in new firearm ownership (P < .03). CONCLUSIONS: There has been a surge in firearm injuries in young children and inflicted by young children during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent and critical need for enactment of interventions aimed at preventing firearm injuries and deaths involving children.","Cohen, Joanna S; Donnelly, Katie; Patel, Shilpa J; Badolato, Gia M; Boyle, Meleah D; McCarter, Robert; Goyal, Monika K",Pediatrics,,653

The alarming speed at which SARS-CoV-2 has spread, and the high mortality rate of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has required both basic science and clinical research to move at an unprecedented pace. Models previously developed to study the immune response against SARS-CoV have been rapidly deployed to now study SARS-CoV-2. To date, both small and large animal models are remarkably consistent when infected with SARS-CoV-2; however, certain models have proven more useful when answering specific immunological questions than others. Small animal models, such as Syrian hamsters, ferrets, and mice carrying the hACE2 transgene, appear to reliably recapitulate the initial cytokine surge seen in COVID-19 as well as show significant innate and adaptive cell infiltration in to the lung early in infection. Additionally, these models develop strong antibody responses to the virus, are protected from reinfection, and genetically modified versions exist that can be used to ask specific immunological questions. Large animal models such as rhesus and cynomologus macaques and African green monkeys are critical to understanding how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection because they are considered to be the most similar to humans. These models are considered the gold standard for assessing vaccine efficacy and protection, and recapitulate the initial cytokine surge, immune cell infiltration into the lung, certain aspects of thrombosis, and the antibody and T-cell response to the virus. In this review, we discuss both small and large animal model studies previously used in SARS-CoV-2 research that may be useful in elucidating the immunological contributions to hallmark syndromes observed with COVID-19.","Veenhuis, Rebecca T; Zeiss, Caroline J",ILAR j,,653

Can it help to figure out a treatment?,2020,"As a respiratory pathogen, the novel coronavirus is commonly associated with aerosol-generating procedures However, it is currently unclear whether spinal surgical procedures pose an additional risk of viral transmission to the surgical team We reviewed the available evidence to ascertain the presence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) blood viremia and the virus' blood transmissibility, as well as evidence of blood-aerosol generation and operating room contamination from spinal surgical procedures There is established evidence of COVID-19 blood viremia, a viral pathogenic cycle via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors and similar blood transmission risk data from the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)/MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) era Spinal surgical practices demonstrate significant blood-aerosol generation from the operative wound due to the use of common surgical instruments, such as electrocautery, as well as high-speed and high-impact devices Based on the evidence, there is an established additional risk of viral transmission faced by surgical teams from blood-aerosols generated from the operative wound of COVID-19- infected patients via the inhalation of virus-laden aerosols and the subsequent initiation of the viral pathogenic cycle through binding with pulmonary ACE-2 receptors Recognizing this additional risk amidst the ongoing pandemic serves as a caution to front-line surgical personnel to strictly adhere to personal protective equipment usage in operating rooms, to modify surgical techniques to reduce the hazard of surgical aerosol generation and COVID-19 viral exposure, and to consider it as an integral aspect of planning and adapting to the ""new normal"" operating practices","Shah, S.; Gadiya, A.; Patel, M.

278135,Excess mortality in the United States in the 21st century,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected everyone's work and daily life, and many employees are talking with their coworkers about this widespread pandemic on a regular basis. In this research, we examine how talking about crises such as COVID-19 at the team level affects team dynamics and behaviors. Drawing upon cultural tightness-looseness theory, we propose that talking about the COVID-19 crisis among team members is positively associated with team cultural tightness, which in turn benefits teams by decreasing team deviance but hurts teams by decreasing team creativity. Furthermore, we suggest that team virtuality moderates and weakens these indirect effects because face-to-face communication about COVID-19 is more powerful in influencing team cultural tightness than virtual communication. Results from a multisource, three-wave field study during the pandemic lend substantial support to these hypotheses. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings and directions for future research.

A comparative observational study, using routine hospital data, was carried out in a large tertiary care hospital in Al Baha, Saudi Arabia, providing care to patients with COVID-19 between April 2019 and August 2019. Patients were categorized into two groups: the Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) group, treated with HCQ in a dose of 400 mg twice daily on the first day, followed by 200 mg twice daily; the non HCQ group, treated with other antiviral or antibacterial treatments according to protocols recommended by the Ministry of Health (MOH) at the time. The primary outcomes were the length of hospital stay, need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), time in ICU, and need for mechanical ventilation. Overall survival was also assessed. 568 patients who received HCQ (treatment group) were compared with 207 patients who did not receive HCQ (control group). HCQ did not improve mortality in the treated group (7.7% vs. 7.2%). There were no significant differences in terms of duration of hospitalization, need for and time in ICU, and need for mechanical ventilation among the groups. Our study provides further evidence that HCQ treatment does not reduce mortality rates, length of hospital stay, admission and time in ICU, and need for mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Alghamdi, Saleh; Barakat, Bassant; Berrou, Ilhem; Alzahrani, Abdulhakim; Haseeb, Abdul; Hammad, Mohamed Anwar; Anwar, Sirajudheen; Sindi, Abdulmajeed Abdulghani A; Almasmoum, Hussain A; Albanghali, Mohammad",,,653

However, the majority of registered clinical trials applying MSC therapy for diverse human diseases have fallen short of expectations, despite the encouraging pre-clinical outcomes in varied animal disease models. This can be attributable to inconsistent criteria for MSCs identity across studies and their inherited heterogeneity. Nowadays, with the emergence of advanced biological techniques and substantial improvements in bio-engineered materials, strategies have been developed to overcome clinical challenges in MSC application. Here in this review, we will discuss the major challenges of MSC therapies in clinical application, the factors impacting the diversity of MSCs, the potential approaches that modify MSC products with the highest therapeutic potential, and finally the usage of MSCs for COVID-19 pandemic disease.","Zhou, Tian; Yuan, Zenan; Weng, Jianyu; Pei, Duanqing; Du, Xin; He, Chang; Lai, Peilong",J Hematol Oncol,,653

288478,Profile of Cynthia Friend,2020,"The World Health Organization (WHO) reported various pneumonia cases ('Coronavirus Disease 2019' [COVID-19]) on 31 December 2019 in Wuhan City, China, which has spread to many countries, including South Africa. In response to this, the President of South Africa declared a state of national disaster on 15th March 2020, followed by introducing various COVID-19 containment measures to minimize the spread of the virus. This paper examines the negative impacts that COVID-19 containment measures may have had on the family as a unit of society and furthermore provides recommendations to mitigate the impacts of these measures. It can be concluded that COVID-19 containment measures, specifically the lockdown restrictions, would yield both short-term and long-term impacts on proper family functioning. Several families in South Africa have been impacted financially due to the closure of business which led to the temporary/permanent unemployment of some breadwinners in the families. This also has had a cascading impact on the food security of families and their ability to afford other basic necessities. Distress as a result of financial challenges or failure to provide for the family alongside spending much time locked down together as a family has also led to violence in the family. This was further exacerbated by the fact that the victims were stuck with the abusers and some could not report or find help due to the restricted movements. Furthermore, since most institutions predominantly moved learning online, results indicated that the lockdown restrictions affected the ability of some individuals especially those from poor families to access formal education during the period due to the lack of digital devices and internet facilities. In order to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 containment measures on the family, there is a need for collaborative efforts at intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, community and policy levels using the ecological framework.","Adebiyi, B.

Methods A total of 867 clinical nurses were randomly selected from the Mianyang Central Hospital. The general information questionnaire, standard self-assessment anxiety scale (SAS) and crisis intervention classification assessment scale (TAF) were used to conduct self-assessment questionnaire survey. Then the data were analyzed by the SPSS22.0 software. Results 38.8% of the nurses had a low risk of infection, 18.0% of them had a medium risk, 29.6% had a medium high risk, and 13.6% had a high risk. The SAS scores of clinical nurses in this hospital were statistically significant different, compared with the Chinese norm value ( P <0.05). The difference between TAF score and the degree of crisis response of nursing students in SARS period was statistically significant ( P <0.05). The majority of clinical nurses had less crisis response to NCP, with 80.7% of them suffered mild cognitive, emotional and behavioral damage, and only 2.0% suffered severe damage. Analysis of related factors showed that department, self-test risk of infection, length of service had significant influence on SAS and TAF scores of clinical nurses ( P <0.05). Conclusion During the period of NCP prevalence, no obvious anxiety and crisis reaction among clinical nurses is found in the third grade hospital. However, the psychological changes of clinical nurses with middle-age, from key epidemic prevention departments and in high risk of self-test infection are more likely to produce anxiety and crisis reaction. Therefore, appropriate and timely psychological intervention should be given.","Jia, PU; Guirong, LI; CAO, Lulu; Yuanchen, WU; Linglin, XU",Chongqing Medicine,,653

The proposed primary culprit of COVID-19 is the intense inflammatory response-an augmented immune response and cytokine storm-severely damaging the lung tissue and rendering some patients' conditions severe enough to require assisted ventilation. Sex differences in the response to inflammation have been documented and can be attributed, at least in part, to sex steroid hormones. Moreover, age-associated decreases in sex steroid hormones, namely, estrogen and testosterone, may mediate proinflammatory increases in older adults that could increase their risk of COVID-19 adverse outcomes. Sex hormones can mitigate the inflammation response and might provide promising therapeutic potential for patients with COVID-19. In this article, we explore the possible anti-inflammatory effects of estrogen and testosterone and the anabolic effect of testosterone, with particular attention to the potential therapeutic role of hormone replacement therapy in older men and women with COVID-19.","Al-Lami, Rasha A; Urban, Randall J; Volpi, Elena; Algburi, Ammar M A; Baillargeon, Jacques",Mayo Clin Proc,,653

The genetic traits as well as evolutionary processes in this novel coronavirus are not fully characterized, and their roles in viral pathogenesis are yet largely unknown. To get a better picture of the codon architecture of this newly emerging coronavirus, in this study we perform bioinformatic analysis, based on publicly available nucleotide sequences of SARS-CoV-2 along with those of other members of human coronaviruses as well as non-human coronaviruses in different hosts, to take a snapshot of the genome-wide codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 and uncover that all over-represented codons end with A/U and this newly emerging coronavirus has a relatively low codon usage bias, which is shaped by both mutation pressure and natural selection. Additionally, there is slight variation in the codon usage pattern among the SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different geo-locations. Furthermore, the overall codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 is generally similar to that of its phylogenetic relatives among non-human betacoronaviruses such as RaTG13. Taken together, we comprehensively analyze the characteristics of codon usage pattern in SARS-CoV-2 via bioinformatic approaches. The information from this research may not only be helpful to get new insights into the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, but also have potential value for developing coronavirus vaccines.","Hou, Wei",Virol J,,653
349672,Genome-wide RNA interference screening reveals a COPI-MAP2K3 pathway required for YAP regulation,2020,"We assessed the mental health of parents (N = 1450, Mage = 40.76) of special needs children during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an online survey comprising items on demographic data; two self-designed questionnaires (children's behavioral problems/psychological demand of parents during COVID-19); and four standardized questionnaires, including the General Health Questionnaire, Perceived Social Support, Parenting Stress Index, and Neuroticism Extraversion Openness Five Factor Inventory. The results showed that there were significant differences among parents of children with different challenges. Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder were more likely to have mental health problems compared to parents whose children had an intellectual disability or a visual or hearing impairment. Behavioral problems of children and psychological demands of parents were common factors predicting the mental health of all parents. Parent-child dysfunctional interactions and parenting distress were associated with parents of children with autism spectrum disorder. Family support, having a difficult child, and parenting distress were associated with having children with an intellectual disability. It is necessary to pay attention to the parents' mental health, provide more social and family support, and reduce parenting pressures.","Chen, Sui-Qing; Chen, Shu-Dan; Li, Xing-Kai; Ren, Jie",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,653

DESIGN: This is a sequential mixed-methods study using online surveys and semistructured interviews. Interview data were inductively coded and thematically analysed. Survey data were descriptively analysed. SETTING: GP surgeries and acute National Health Service Trusts in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: GPs and clinicians leading care for patients discharged from ICU. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Usual follow-up practice after ICU discharge, changes in follow-up during the pandemic, and GP awareness of follow-up and support needs of patients discharged from ICU. RESULTS: We obtained 170 survey responses and conducted 23 interviews. Over 60% of GPs were unaware of the follow-up services generally provided by their local hospitals and whether or not these were functioning during the pandemic. Eighty per cent of ICUs reported some form of follow-up services, with 25% of these suspending provision during the peak of the pandemic and over half modifying their provision (usually to provide the service remotely). Common themes relating to barriers to provision of follow-up were funding complexities, remit and expertise, and communication between ICU and community services. Discharge documentation was described as poor and lacking key information. Both groups mentioned difficulties accessing services in the community and lack of clarity about who was responsible for referrals and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has highlighted long-standing issues of continuity of care and complex funding streams for post-ICU follow-up care. The large cohort of ICU patients admitted due to COVID-19 highlights the need for improved follow-up services and communication between specialists and GPs, not only for patients with COVID-19, but for all those discharged from ICU.","Castro-Avila, Ana Cristina; Jefferson, Laura; Dale, Veronica; Bloor, Karen",BMJ Open,,653

349912,IL-6 trans-signaling induces plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 from vascular endothelial cells in cytokine release syndrome,2020,"Drug safety is generally established from clinical trials, by pharmacovigilance programs and during observational Phase IV safety studies according to drug intended or approved indications. The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of potential adverse drug events (ADE) associated with drugs repurposed for COVID-19 treatment in a large-scale population. Drug claims were used to calculate a baseline medication risk score (MRS) indicative of ADE risk level. Fictitious claims of repurposed drugs were added, one at a time, to patients' drug regimens to calculate a new MRS and compute a level of risk. Drug claims data from enrollees with Regence health insurance were used and sub-payer analyses were performed with Medicare and Commercial insured groups. Simulated interventions were conducted with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, alone or combined with azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir, along with terfenadine and fexofenadine as positive and negative controls for drug-induced Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). 527,471 subjects (56.6% female; mean [SD] age, 47 [21]) were studied. The simulated addition of each repurposed drug caused an increased risk of ADEs (median MRS increased by two-to-seven points, p<0.001). The increase in ADE risk was mainly driven by an increase in CYP450 drug interaction risk score and by drug-induced LQTS risk score. The Medicare group presented a greater risk overall compared to Commercial group. All repurposed drugs were associated with an increased risk of ADEs. Our simulation strategy could be used as a blueprint to assess preemptively safety associated with future repurposed or new drugs.","Smith, Matt K; Bikmetov, Ravil; Al Rihani, Sweilem B; Deodhar, Malavika; Hafermann, Matthew; Dow, Pamela; Turgeon, Jacques; Michaud, Veronique",Clinical and translational science (Online),,653
351790,Understanding why we do what we do during a global pandemic,2021,"COVID-19 forced radical changes to the delivery of college curricula world-wide during the spring of 2020 with little to no warning Commonly, classes that had been delivered face to face were moved to a virtual delivery format;a practice that continued during the fall 2020 semester The purpose of this investigation was to perform an interim analysis of COVID-related changes on student performance We hypothesized that despite adequate preparation time for conversion to online delivery and a student body comprised largely of digital natives, the collective challenges associated with COVID-19 would negatively impact student performance To address this hypothesis we compared midterm data from fall 2020 to a comparison population comprised of midterm data pooled from the 2015-2019 fall semesters from a large, public, Midwest university Midterms are assigned as letter grades to students receiving a C- or below in a class Letter grades were tallied for each term and then converted to a numerical score using a five-point scale (C- = 1, F = 5) and summed across all midterm grades within a term to allow quantitation and statistical comparison We discovered that the percent of students with a midterm (&lt;C in a class) was ~15% lower in 2020 compared to the comparison group (p&lt;0 0001) and that this rate has been declining since 2015 (p&lt;0 0001) However, of the students that received midterms, there was a slight but significant increase in the number of midterms/student (p&lt;0 01) as well as in the variation of the midterms/student (p&lt;0 001) in 2020 compared to the comparison group Moreover, students had lower grades reported (0 39 summed points;p&lt;0 0001) and a greater amount of variance among those reported grades in the 2020 midterm group compared to the comparison group (p&lt;0 0001) Finally, within the 2020 dataset, STEM majors had 10% more midterms/student (p&lt;0 05) and these midterms were more severe (0 52 summed points;p&lt;0 05) compared to non-STEM majors These data indicate that, surprisingly, and despite COVID-19 related challenges, the percent of total students with midterms was decreased compared to previous semesters Importantly though, despite significant efforts of faculty and universities, there is a population of students with exaggerated performance deficits compared to previous semesters Given our finding of a smaller population of students with midterms, the exaggerated performance deficits in students with midterms may be due to factors external to instructional quality and point to social-, economic-, health-, and internet access-related barriers, which themselves maybe independent or interdependent, as well as the suitability and/or preparedness of the student for online instruction Identification and remediation of these factors is essential given the likelihood of continued and expanded virtual learning, particularly for STEM students","Selsby, Joshua Bundy Jennifer",The FASEB Journal,,653
351791,Understanding why we do what we do during a global pandemic,2021,"PURPOSE: TO assess perceptions and implications of COVID-19 infection across the spectrum of individuals with visually impairment (VI) and those with normal sight. DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional comparative study. METHODS: Setting: institutional. PATIENTS: 232 patients and their caregivers. Four groups were created based on better eye characteristics: blind (best-corrected distance visual acuity [BCDVA] <3/60 or visual field <10 central degrees); severe VI (BCDVA &#8804;3/60 to <6/60; vertical cup-to-disc ratio &#8805;0.85 or neuroretinal rim width &#8804;0.1); moderate VI (BCDVA &#8804;6/60 to <6/18); or no or mild VI (controls: BCDVA &#8805;6/18) based on International Classification of Diseases-10 criteria and Foster and Quigley's consensus definition of glaucoma. PROCEDURE: telephone questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: differences in perceptions and implications of COVID-19 infection across various levels of VI. Caregiver perceptions were a secondary outcome measure. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 232 participants, with 58 participants in each VI group. Mean age was 58.9 ± 13.2 years old. Greater degrees of VI were associated with older age (P = .008) and lower education level (P = .046). Blind participants more commonly perceived vision as a risk factor for contracting COVID-19 (P = .045), were concerned about access to health care (P <.001), obtained news through word of mouth (P <.001), and less commonly wore masks (P = .003). Controls more commonly performed frequent handwashing (P = .001), were aware of telemedicine (P = .029), and had fewer concerns about social interactions (P = .020) than groups with substantial VI. All caregivers reported more frequent patient care since the COVID-19 pandemic began. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic might have had a disproportionate impact on the visually impaired, and evidence-based assessments of COVID-19 health outcomes in this population are warranted.","Shalaby, Wesam S; Odayappan, Annamalai; Venkatesh, Rengaraj; Swenor, Bonnielin K; Ramulu, Pradeep Y; Robin, Alan L; Srinivasan, Kavitha; Shukla, Aakriti Garg",Am J Ophthalmol,,653

METHODS: Members of the Southeastern Surgical Congress were surveyed regarding system adjustments, personal impact, and productivity losses. Subgroups were analyzed for disproportionate impact across practice models (academic/employed/private), practice communities (urban, suburban, rural), and practice case-mix categories (broad general surgery, narrow general surgery, specialty practice, hospital-based practice). RESULTS: 135 respondents reported that 98.5% of surgeons and 97% of hospitals canceled elective cases. Practices and hospitals reduced staffing dramatically. Telemedicine was utilized by most respondents. Hospitals variably implemented system changes, developed tests, and set up diagnostic centers. Most surgeons anticipated resumption of practice and hospital activity by July 1, 2020. More than one-quarter reported worsened financial status and personal well-being. Interestingly, family/personal relationships were improved in more than one-third. Most surgeons anticipate reduced year-end case volumes, clinical productivity, and salary. In subgroup analyses, academic surgeons were more likely than employed and private-practice surgeons to use telemedicine and to work in hospitals with in-house COVID-19 testing. Private-practice surgeons expected decreased financial status, case volumes, relative value units (RVUs), and salary. More rural surgeons anticipate reduced salary than urban and suburban surgeons. Surgeons in narrow general surgery practice reported more furlough of employees than specialty surgeons, hospital-based surgeons, and broad-based general surgeons. Narrow-practice surgeons and specialists were more likely to report RVU reductions and improved family/personal relationships. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 slowdown affected surgeons throughout the southeastern United States. Variations between different practice models, communities, and case-mix categories may help inform surgeons in the future.","Richmond, Bryan K; Dean, L Scott; Farrell, Timothy M",Am Surg,,653
365241,Homeless persons and migrants in precarious housing conditions and COVID-19 pandemic: peculiarities and prevention strategies,2020,"BACKGROUND: Effective prevention against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is currently limited to nonpharmaceutical strategies. Laboratory and observational data suggested that hydroxychloroquine had biological activity against SARS-CoV-2, potentially permitting its use for prevention. OBJECTIVE: To test hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: Household-randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine postexposure prophylaxis. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04328961). SETTING: National U.S. multicenter study. PARTICIPANTS: Close contacts recently exposed (<96 hours) to persons with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. INTERVENTION: Hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/d for 3 days followed by 200 mg/d for 11 days) or ascorbic acid (500 mg/d followed by 250 mg/d) as a placebo-equivalent control. MEASUREMENTS: Participants self-collected mid-turbinate swabs daily (days 1 to 14) for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed incident SARS-CoV-2 infection among persons who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at enrollment. RESULTS: Between March and August 2020, 671 households were randomly assigned: 337 (407 participants) to the hydroxychloroquine group and 334 (422 participants) to the control group. Retention at day 14 was 91%, and 10 724 of 11 606 (92%) expected swabs were tested. Among the 689 (89%) participants who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline, there was no difference between the hydroxychloroquine and control groups in SARS-CoV-2 acquisition by day 14 (53 versus 45 events; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.66]; P > 0.20). The frequency of participants experiencing adverse events was higher in the hydroxychloroquine group than the control group (66 [16.2%] versus 46 [10.9%], respectively; P = 0.026). LIMITATION: The delay between exposure, and then baseline testing and the first dose of hydroxychloroquine or ascorbic acid, was a median of 2 days. CONCLUSION: This rigorous randomized controlled trial among persons with recent exposure excluded a clinically meaningful effect of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

However, it is unknown what impact they could have on the evolution of patients, particularly critically ill patients. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics and impact of ICU-acquired infections in patients with COVID-19. A retrospective cohort study was conducted, evaluating all patients with critical COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital in Southern Peru from 28 March 2020 to 1 March 2021. Of the 124 patients evaluated, 50 (40.32%) developed a healthcare-associated infection (HAI), which occurred at a median of 8 days (IQR 6-17) after ICU admission. The proportion of patients with HAI that required ceftriaxone was significantly higher;the same was true for the use of dexamethasone. Forty bacteria isolations (80%) were classified as XDR to antibiotics, with the most common organisms being Acinetobacter baumannii (54%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%);33% (41/124) died at the ICU during the follow-up. In the adjusted analysis, healthcare-associated infection was associated with an increased risk of mortality (aHR= 2.7;95% CI: 1.33-5.60) and of developing acute renal failure (aRR = 3.1;95% CI: 1.42-6.72). The incidence of healthcare infection mainly by XDR pathogens is high in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and is associated with an increased risk of complications or death.","Copaja-Corzo, C.; Hueda-Zavaleta, M.; Benites-Zapata, V.

405019,The role of fibril structure and surface hydrophobicity in secondary nucleation of amyloid fibrils,2020,"In this chapter, a fractional SEIR model and its robust first-order unconditionally convergent numerical method is proposed Initial conditions based on Namibian data as of 4 July 2020 were used to simulate two scenarios In the first scenario, it is assumed that the proper control mechanisms for kerbing the spread of COVID-19 are in place In the second scenario, a worst-case scenario is presented The worst case is characterised by ineffective COVID-19 control mechanisms Results indicate that if proper control mechanisms are followed, Namibia can contain the spread of COVID-19 in the country to a lowest level of 1, 800 positive cases by October 2020 However, if no proper control mechanisms are followed, Namibia can hit a potentially unmanageable level of over 14, 000 positive cases by October 2020 From a mathematical point of view, results indicate that the fractional SEIR model and the proposed method are appropriate for modelling the chaotic nature observed in the spread of COVID-19 Results herein are fundamentally important to policy and decision-makers in devising appropriate control and management strategies for curbing further spread of COVID-19 in Namibia © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","Nuugulu, S.

415253,Analyzing the vast coronavirus literature with CoronaCentral,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has been recognized as an aerosol-generating procedure. This study aimed to systematically compare the degree of face shield contamination between endoscopists who performed EGD on patients lying in the left lateral decubitus (LL) and prone positions. METHODS: This is a randomized trial in patients scheduled for EGD between April and June 2020. Eligible 212 patients were randomized with 1:1 allocation. Rapid adenosine triphosphate test was used to determine contamination level using relative light units of greater than 200 as a cutoff value. All eligible patients were randomized to lie in either the LL or prone position during EGD. The primary outcome was the rate of contamination on the endoscopist's face shield. RESULTS: The majority of patients were female (63%), with a mean age of 60 ± 13 years. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. There was no face shield contamination after EGD in either group. The number of coughs in the LL group was higher than the prone group (1.38 ± 1.8 vs 0.89 ± 1.4, P = 0.03). The mean differences in relative light units on the face shield before and after EGD in the LL and prone groups were 9.9 ± 20.9 and 4.1 ± 6 (P = 0.008), respectively. CONCLUSION: As measured by the adenosine triphosphate test, performing diagnostic EGD does not lead to contamination on the face shield of the endoscopist. However, placing patients in the prone position may further mitigate the risk.","Pittayanon, Rapat; Faknak, Natee; Ananchuensook, Prooksa; Prasoppokakorn, Thaninee; Plai-Dum, Suppawatsa; Thummongkhol, Tiwaporn; Paitoonpong, Leilani; Rerknimitr, Rungsun",J. gastroenterol. hepatol,,653
415254,Analyzing the vast coronavirus literature with CoronaCentral,2021,"Understanding the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial for improved control and social distancing strategies. To that effect, we have employed the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, refined by contact tracing and hospitalization data from Indian provinces Kerala, Delhi, Maharashtra, and West Bengal, as well as from overall India. We have performed a sensitivity analysis to identify the most crucial input parameters, and we have calibrated the model to describe the data as best as possible. Short-term predictions reveal an increasing and worrying trend of COVID-19 cases for all four provinces and India as a whole, while long-term predictions also reveal the possibility of oscillatory dynamics. Our research thus leaves the option open that COVID-19 might become a seasonal occurrence. We also simulate and discuss the impact of media on the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Khajanchi, Subhas; Sarkar, Kankan; Mondal, Jayanta; Perc, Matjaz",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06286v1.pdf,653
425163,Different approaches to the analysis of causes of death during the COVID-19 epidemic,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The burst of COVID-19 epidemics in Italy prompted the Italian Society of Hypertension to start an observational study to explore the characteristics of the hospitalized victims of the disease. The current analysis aimed to investigate the predictors of healing among Italian COVID-19 patients. We also assessed the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on the outcome. METHODS: We designed a cross-sectional, observational, multicenter, nationwide survey in Italy to explore the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. We analyzed information from 2446 charts of Italian patients admitted for certified COVID-19 in 27 hospitals. Healing from COVID-19 infection, defined as two consecutive negative swabs, was reported in 544 patients (22.2%), 95% of them were hospitalized. RESULTS: Age and Charlson Comorbidity Index were significantly lower in healing compared with nonhealing patients (63â±â15 vs. 69â±â15 and 2â±â2 vs. 3â±â2, both Pâ<â0.05). In multivariable regression model, predictors of healing were younger age (OR: 0.99; 95% CI 0.98-0.99, Pâ=â0.0001), absence of chronic kidney disease (OR: 0.35; 95% CI 0.17-0.70, Pâ=â0.003) or heart failure (OR: 0.44; 95% CI, 0.28-0.70, Pâ=â0.001). In the subgroup of patients suffering from hypertension and/or heart failure (nâ=â1498), no differences were observed in the use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that younger age and absence of comorbidities play a major role in determining healing in patients with COVID-19. No effects of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on the outcome was reported.","Mancusi, Costantino; Grassi, Guido; Borghi, Claudio; Carugo, Stefano; Fallo, Francesco; Ferri, Claudio; Giannattasio, Cristina; Grassi, Davide; Letizia, Claudio; Minuz, Pietro; Muiesan, Maria Lorenza; Perlini, Stefano; Pucci, Giacomo; Rizzoni, Damiano; Salvetti, Massimo; Sarzani, Riccardo; Sechi, Leonardo; Veglio, Franco; Volpe, Massimo; Iaccarino, Guido",J. hypertens,,653

As of January 2021, the number of cases worldwide reached 103 million cases and 2.22 million deaths which were confirmed as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This global pandemic galvanized the scientific community to study the causative virus (SARS-CoV2) pathogenesis, transmission, and clinical symptoms. Remarkably, the most common complication associated with this disease is the cytokine storm which is responsible for COVID-19 mortality. Thus, targeting the cytokine storm with new medications is needed to hamper COVID-19 complications where the most prominent strategy for the treatment is drug repurposing. Through this strategy, several steps are skipped especially those required for testing drug safety and thus may help in reducing the dissemination of this pandemic. Accordingly, the aim of this review is to outline the pathogenesis, clinical features, and immune complications of SARS-CoV2 in addition to suggesting several repurposed drugs with their plausible mechanism of action for possible management of severe COVID-19 cases.","Shawki, May Ahmed; Elsayed, Noha Salah; Mantawy, Eman M; Said, Riham S",Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,,653
433799,Geometric anomaly detection in data,2020,"The worldwide coronavirus (COVID-19) has had profound effects on all aspects of life: physical health, the ability to travel locally or to more distant destinations, material and financial resources, and psychosocial wellbeing. Couples, families, and communities and individual persons in those relationships have struggled to cope with emerging depression, anxiety, and trauma, and the rise of relational conflict. In this article, we suggest that the existential nature of the pandemic's challenges requires more than just the usual psychosocial interventions. We propose a taxonomy of responses to foster coping and resilience-""Reaching Up, Down, In, and Around."" ""Reaching Up"" includes accessing spiritual, religious, and ethical values. ""Reaching Down"" includes ideas and practices that foster a revised relationship with the Earth and its resources, and that engage families to participate in activities that aid the Earth's recovery from decades of human-caused damage. ""Reaching In"" represents a turn towards experiences available in the mind and in shared minds in relationships that provide pleasure, excitement, joy, and peace, given that external sources of these emotions are of limited availability due to quarantine. ""Reaching Around"" involves reframing the mandate for ""social distancing"" as fostering social connection and support while maintaining physical distancing. The challenges for family therapists, whose practices are confined largely to online therapy, and who are struggling with the same fears and constraints as those persons they are attempting to help, are also discussed.","Fraenkel, Peter; Cho, Wonyoung L",Fam. process,,653

In addition, CT scans from 2 months before infection and from 6 days prior to death were compared. Comparison of the CT scans showed bilateral development of widespread fibrosis in previously healthy lungs. Microscopic examination showed different areas with acute and organising diffuse alveolar damage and fibrosis with honeycomb-like remodelling and bronchial metaplasia.

In addition, this study analysed the association of socio-demographic variables with KAP apart from finding the relationship between KAP. Subject and methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in India. Study participants were selected using a convenient sampling method from various higher educational institutions across 22 states in India. Data was collected using self-administered close-ended questionnaires via Google forms. The data were analysed using frequencies and percentage for descriptive purposes. A chi-square test was used to determine the association between groups, and correlation analysis was used to illustrate the significant relationship between KAP. Results: The majority, that is, 65.5% of students possess a high level of knowledge about the disease. It was noteworthy that 71.0% of them had a positive attitude towards COVID-19 and 66.7% of them exhibited desirable practices to mitigate COVID-19. Furthermore, the results showed a significant association between KAP and some of the socio-demographic variables studied. Social media emerged as a vital source of information regarding COVID-19 for the majority (81.0%) of students. Also, a strong significant positive correlation was observed between KAP variables. Conclusion: One-fourth of the students demonstrated only low and moderate levels of knowledge, negative attitude and undesirable practices in preventing COVID-19. The implications suggesting various approaches to enhance KAP to moderate the spread of COVID-19 among the students were recommended to aid the higher educational institutions.","Padmanaban, Srinivasan; Rajendran, Poornima; Davis, Prem; Velayutham, Prabu",Z Gesundh Wiss,,653

We aimed to confirm the association between olfactory function and cognitive impairment by assessing the olfactory function of older persons with cognitive impairment and identify whether olfactory function is associated with cognitive impairment. For this study, we recruited 117 older people aged ≥65 years with cognitive impairments from a public hospital in Korea. We used the Korean version of the expanded clinical dementia rating scale to evaluate participants’ cognitive impairments, and the University of Pennsylvania’s smell identification test to assess their olfactory function. Our results indicate a significant negative correlation between olfactory function and all domains of cognitive impairment (memory, orientation, judgement and problem-solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care). In addition, olfactory function was a factor associated with cognitive impairment in older persons. Therefore, we expect that our results to provide useful data for the development of interventions using olfactory stimulation to improve cognitive function in older persons with cognitive impairment.","Park, Hyangjeong Kim Heejeong Kim Sisook Cha Hyegyeong",Healthcare,,653

It is important to determine how relationships between key outcomes, specifically loneliness and depressive symptoms, manifest over a brief timeframe and in a pandemic context. METHOD: Data was gathered over 4 months (March - June 2020) using an online survey with three repeated measures at monthly intervals (N = 1958; 69.8% females; Age 18-87 years, M = 37.01, SD = 12.81). Associations between loneliness, depression symptoms, and emotion regulation difficulty were tested using Pearson's product moment correlations, and descriptive statistics were calculated for all study variables. Cross-lagged structural equation modelling was used to examine the temporal relationships between variables. RESULTS: The longitudinal association between loneliness and depressive symptoms was reciprocal. Loneliness predicted higher depressive symptoms one month later, and depressive symptoms predicted higher loneliness one month later. The relationship was not mediated by emotion regulation difficulties. Emotion regulation difficulties and depressive symptoms were also reciprocally related over time. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the reliance on self-report data and the non-representative sample. There was no pre-pandemic assessment limiting the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the mental health impact of the COVID-19 crisis. CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness should be considered an important feature of case conceptualisation for depression during this time. Clinical efforts to improve mental health during the pandemic could focus on interventions that target either loneliness, depression, or both. Potential approaches include increasing physical activity or low-intensity cognitive therapies delivered remotely.","Groarke, Jenny M; McGlinchey, Emily; McKenna-Plumley, Phoebe E; Berry, Emma; Graham-Wisener, Lisa; Armour, Cherie",J Affect Disord,,653

464558,DNA-inspired nanomaterials for enhanced endosomal escape,2021,"RATIONALE: Maintaining social distance during the COVID-19 pandemic can save lives. We therefore set out to test communication strategies to promote social distancing. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test two novel public health messages against a control message. The first was designed to exploit the ""identifiable victim"" effect by highlighting the risk of transmission to identifiable vulnerable persons. The second sought to counteract intuitive underestimation of exponential transmission. METHOD: In total, 500 Irish adults undertook a pre-registered, online experiment. They were randomly assigned to a control group or one of two treatment groups. The control group viewed a current poster that encouraged a 2-m separation between people. The two treatment groups saw posters of similar design, but with narrative messages describing how an individual had infected a specific vulnerable person or multiple other people. Later questions measured intentions to undertake three specific types of social interaction over the coming days and the stated acceptability of three other types of social interaction. Pilot work had identified these six behaviors as ""marginal"" - people were unsure whether they were advisable. RESULTS: Participants in the treatment conditions were more cautious about undertaking the behaviors and less accepting of them. This positive effect occurred despite participants rating the treatment posters as likely to be less effective and memorable than the control poster. CONCLUSIONS: Messages that invoke thoughts of infecting vulnerable people or large numbers of people can motivate social distancing and, hence, help to limit the spread of COVID-19. Stated public evaluations (obtained via focus groups or surveys) may underestimate the actual effectiveness of such emotional messages.","Lunn, Peter D; Timmons, Shane; Belton, Cameron A; Barjaková, Martina; Julienne, Hannah; Lavin, Ciarán",Soc Sci Med,,653

467228,The potential stickiness of pandemic-induced behavior changes in the United States,2021,"Introduction and objectives Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in acute situations, where it is associated with more complications and higher mortality.Methods Analysis of the international HOPE registry (NCT04334291). The objective was to assess the prognostic information of AF in COVID-19 patients. A multivariate analysis and propensity score matching were performed to assess the relationship between AF and mortality. We also evaluated the impact on mortality and embolic events of the CHA2DS2-VASc score in these patients.Results Among 6217 patients enrolled in the HOPE registry, 250 had AF (4.5%). AF patients had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities. After propensity score matching, these differences were attenuated. Despite this, patients with AF had a higher incidence of in-hospital complications such as heart failure (19.3% vs 11.6%, P = .021) and respiratory insufficiency (75.9% vs 62.3%, P = .002), as well as a higher 60-day mortality rate (43.4% vs 30.9%, P = .005). On multivariate analysis, AF was independently associated with higher 60-day mortality (hazard ratio, 1.234; 95%CI, 1.003-1.519). CHA2DS2-VASc score acceptably predicts 60-day mortality in COVID-19 patients (area ROC, 0.748; 95%CI, 0.733-0.764), but not its embolic risk (area ROC, 0.411; 95%CI, 0.147-0.675).Conclusions AF in COVID-19 patients is associated with a higher number of complications and 60-day mortality. The CHA2DS2-VASc score may be a good risk marker in COVID patients but does not predict their embolic risk.","Uribarri, Aitor; Núñez-Gil, Iván J; Aparisi, Álvaro; Arroyo-Espliguero, Ramón; Eid, Charbel Maroun; Romero, Rodolfo; Becerra-Muñoz, Víctor M; Feltes, Gisela; Molina, María; García-Aguado, Marcos; Cerrato, Enrico; Capel-Astrua, Thamar; Alfonso-Rodríguez, Emilio; Castro-Mejía, Alex F; Raposeiras-Roubín, Sergio; Espejo, Carolina; Pérez-Solé, Nerea; Bardají, Alfredo; Marín, Francisco; Fabregat-Andrés, Óscar; D039,; ascenzo, Fabrizio; Santoro, Francesco; Akin, Ibrahim; Estrada, Vicente; Fernández-Ortiz, Antonio; Macaya, Carlos",Rev. esp. cardiol.

This work has aimed to study Th polarization in acute COVID-19 and its possible association with the outcome through an observational prospective study. Fifty-eight COVID-19 patients were recruited in the Medicine Department of the hospital ""12 de Octubre,"" 55 patients remaining after losses to follow-up. Four groups were established according to maximum degree of disease progression. T-helper cell percentages and phenotypes, analyzed by flow cytometer, and serum cytokines levels, analyzed by Luminex, were evaluated when the microbiological diagnosis (acute phase) of the disease was obtained. Our study found a significant reduction of %Th1 and %Th17 cells with higher activated %Th2 cells in the COVID-19 patients compared with reference population. A higher percent of senescent Th2 cells was found in the patients who died than in those who survived. Senescent Th2 cell percentage was an independent risk factor for death (OR: 13.88) accompanied by the numbers of total lymphocytes (OR: 0.15) with an AUC of 0.879. COVID-19 patients showed a profile of pro-inflammatory serum cytokines compared to controls, with higher levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-15, and IP-10. IL-10 and IL-13 were also elevated in patients compared to controls. Patients who did not survive presented significantly higher levels of IL-15 than those who recovered. No significant differences were observed according to disease progression groups. The study has shown that increased levels of IL-15 and a high Th2 response are associated with a fatal outcome of the disease.","Gil-Etayo, Francisco Javier; Suàrez-Fernández, Patricia; Cabrera-Marante, Oscar; Arroyo, Daniel; Garcinuño, Sara; Naranjo, Laura; Pleguezuelo, Daniel E; Allende, Luis M; Mancebo, Esther; Lalueza, Antonio; Díaz-Simón, Raquel; Paz-Artal, Estela; Serrano, Antonio",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,653

The aim of this study is to examine the incidence and outcomes of all COVID-19 patients with rheumatologic conditions in Hong Kong. METHODS: This is a population-based retrospective study. All patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR with a previous diagnosis of rheumatologic diseases were reviewed. The incidence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatologic conditions was calculated and compared to the general population in Hong Kong. Descriptive data of those rheumatologic patients with COVID-19 and the clinical course of the index infection were presented. RESULTS: Up till 27 May 2020, there were 1067 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Hong Kong which had a population of 7.5 million. Out of the 39,835 patients with underlying rheumatologic diseases, we identified 5 PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases. The estimated incidence of COVID-19 was 0.0126% patients with rheumatologic diseases, compared to 0.0142% in the general population. All 5 patients had inflammatory arthropathies. One patient was on hydroxychloroquine and sulphasalazine, and one was on methotrexate. None of the 3534 patients on b/tsDMARDs was infected. Four patients had leucopenia/lymphopenia and stool viral PCR was positive in 3 patients. All patients made uneventful recovery without complications or flare of underlying diseases. CONCLUSIONS: We found no alarming signals of increased frequency or severity of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatologic diseases, although extrapolation of the results to other populations with different infection control strategies should be made with caution.","So, Ho; Mak, Joyce Wing-Yan; So, Jacqueline; Lui, Grace; Lun, Frankie; Lee, Jolly; Chan, Shirley; Ho, Carmen; Chan, Jacky Man-Chun; Kong, Shing-Pak; Ng, Woon-Leung; Tam, Lai-Shan",Semin Arthritis Rheum,,653

498165,"Sialoglycan recognition is a common connection linking acidosis, zinc, and HMGB1 in sepsis",2021,"December 2019 saw the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has spread across the globe. The high infectivity and ongoing mortality of SARS-CoV-2 emphasize the demand of drug discovery. Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. ACE2 exists as a membrane-bound protein on major viral target pulmonary epithelial cells, and its peptidase domain (PD) interacts SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with higher affinity. Therefore, targeting ACE2 is an important pharmacological intervention for a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, we described the two-way switch role of ACE2 in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia and underlying comorbidities, and discussed the potential effect of the ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker on a hypertension patient with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we analyzed the S-protein-binding site on ACE2 and suggested that blocking hot spot-31 and hot spot-353 on ACE2 could be a therapeutic strategy for preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Besides, the recombinant ACE2 protein could be another potential treatment option for SARS-CoV-2 induced acute severe lung failure. This review could provide beneficial information for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents via targeting ACE2 and the clinical usage of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) drugs for novel coronavirus pneumonia treatment.","Pang, Xiao Cong; Zhang, Han Xu; Zhang, Zhi; Rinkiko, Suguro; Cui, Yi Min; Zhu, Yi Zhun",Molecules (Basel),,653

506780,Effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy in severe COVID-19 patients,2020,"The current study examines the association of individual hoarding levels with temporal discounting of different commodities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on their hoarding level, participants were assigned to the Hoarding Group (HG) or the Non-Hoarding Group (NHG). Participants performed two delay discounting tasks: a traditional task with monetary options and a modified task, where money was replaced with disposable surgical masks, a needed commodity during the pandemic. Results revealed a stronger preference for immediate commodity, therefore a higher discount rate, when evaluating surgical masks compared to money in the whole sample, and an overall higher tendency in discounting both type of rewards in the NHG compared to the HG. Moreover, non-hoarders discounted money significantly more than hoarders, while no significant differences were detected in the surgical mask version of the task. Possible explanations for this result are discussed in the light of a situational frame that makes salient the notion of scarcity, like the one induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The hoarding dimension of cluttering was found to be the only dimension to significantly correlate with the discount rate on surgical masks. Altogether, these findings shed light on the role of general hoarding level and specific hoarding dimensions on intertemporal preferences with different commodities by contributing to the theoretical debate about impulsivity in hoarders’ behavior. Furthermore, the present results help to understand the general population’s preferences during times of crisis, thus contributing to the investigation of the effects of COVID-19 on consumers’ behavior. © 2021 Cannito, Anzani, Bortolotti, Palumbo, Ceccato, Di Crosta, Di Domenico and Palumbo.","Cannito, L.; Anzani, S.; Bortolotti, A.; Palumbo, R.; Ceccato, I.; Di Crosta, A.; Di Domenico, A.",Frontiers in Psychology,,653

METHODS: We identified opioid prescriptions dispensed to children and young adults in 2019 in the IQVIA Longitudinal Prescription Database, which captures 92% of US pharmacies. We calculated the proportion of all US children and young adults with &#8805;1 dispensed opioid prescription in 2019. We calculated performance on 6 metrics of high-risk prescribing and the proportion of prescriptions written by each specialty. Of all prescriptions and those classified as high risk by &#8805;1 metric, we calculated the proportion written by high-volume prescribers with prescription counts at the &#8805;95th percentile. RESULTS: Analyses included 4 027 701 prescriptions. In 2019, 3.5% of US children and young adults had &#8805;1 dispensed opioid prescription. Of prescriptions for opioid-naive patients, 41.8% and 3.8% exceeded a 3-day and 7-day supply, respectively. Of prescriptions for young children, 8.4% and 7.7% were for codeine and tramadol. Of prescriptions for adolescents and young adults, 11.5% had daily dosages of &#8805;50 morphine milligram equivalents; 4.6% had benzodiazepine overlap. Overall, 45.6% of prescriptions were high risk by &#8805;1 metric. Dentists and surgeons wrote 61.4% of prescriptions. High-volume prescribers wrote 53.3% of prescriptions and 53.1% of high-risk prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of pediatric opioid prescriptions are high risk. To reduce high-risk prescribing, initiatives targeting high-volume prescribers may be warranted. However, broad-based initiatives are also needed to address the large share of high-risk prescribing attributable to other prescribers.","Chua, Kao-Ping; Brummett, Chad M; Conti, Rena M; Bohnert, Amy S",Pediatrics,,653

To operate a UAV delivery network, a management system is required to optimize UAV delivery routes. Therefore, we create a routing algorithm to find optimal round-trip routes for UAVs, which deliver goods from depots to customers. Optimal routes per UAV are determined by minimizing delivery distances considering the maximum range and loading capacity of the UAV. In order to accomplish this, we propose an algorithm with four steps. First, we build a virtual network to describe the realistic environment that UAVs would encounter during operation. Second, we determine the optimal number of in-service UAVs per depot. Third, we eliminate subtours, which are infeasible routes, using flow variables part of the constraints. Fourth, we allocate UAVs to customers minimizing delivery distances from depots to customers. In this process, we allow multiple UAVs to deliver goods to one customer at the same time. Finally, we verify that our algorithm can determine the number of UAVs in service per depot, round-trip routes for UAVs, and allocate UAVs to customers to deliver at the minimum cost.","Kim, Sooyeon; Kwak, Jae Hyun; Oh, Byoungryul; Lee, Da-Han; Lee, Duehee",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21041219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33572292/,653

CTH will expand an integrated set of evidence-based practices (EBPs) across health care, behavioral health, justice, and other community-based settings to reduce opioid overdose deaths. We present the rationale for and adaptation of the RE-AIM/PRISM framework and methodological approach used to capture the CTH implementation context and to evaluate implementation fidelity. METHODS: HCS measures key domains of the internal and external CTH implementation context with repeated annual surveys and qualitative interviews with community coalition members and key stakeholders. Core constructs of fidelity include dosage, adherence, quality, and program differentiation—the adaptation of the CTH intervention to fit each community’s needs. Fidelity measures include a monthly CTH checklist, collation of artifacts produced during CTH activities, coalition and workgroup attendance, and coalition meeting minutes. Training and technical assistance delivered by the research sites to the communities are tracked monthly. DISCUSSION: To help attenuate the nation’s opioid epidemic, the adoption of EBPs must be increased in communities. The HCS represents one of the largest and most complex implementation research experiments yet conducted. Our systematic examination of implementation context and fidelity will significantly advance understanding of how to best evaluate community-level implementation of EBPs and assess relations among implementation context, fidelity, and intervention impact.","Knudsen, Hannah K.; Drainoni, Mari-Lynn; Gilbert, Louisa; Huerta, Timothy R.; Oser, Carrie B.; Aldrich, Alison M.; Campbell, Aimee N.C.; Crable, Erika L.; Garner, Bryan R.; Glasgow, LaShawn M.; Goddard-Eckrich, Dawn; Marks, Katherine R.; McAlearney, Ann Scheck; Oga, Emmanuel A.; Scalise, Ariel L.; Walker, Daniel M.",Drug Alcohol Depend,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871620304956?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108330; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33086156/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0376871620304956,653

598967,Constraining the atmospheric OCS budget from sulfur isotopes,2020-08-25,"The outbreak of COVID-19 around the world has caused great pressure to the health care system, and many efforts have been devoted to artificial intelligence (AI)-based analysis of CT and chest X-ray images to help alleviate the shortage of radiologists and improve the diagnosis efficiency. However, only a few works focus on AI-based lung ultrasound (LUS) analysis in spite of its significant role in COVID-19. In this work, we aim to propose a novel method for severity assessment of COVID-19 patients from LUS and clinical information. Great challenges exist regarding the heterogeneous data, multi-modality information, and highly nonlinear mapping. To overcome these challenges, we first propose a dual-level supervised multiple instance learning module (DSA-MIL) to effectively combine the zone-level representations into patient-level representations. Then a novel modality alignment contrastive learning module (MA-CLR) is presented to combine representations of the two modalities, LUS and clinical information, by matching the two spaces while keeping the discriminative features. To train the nonlinear mapping, a staged representation transfer (SRT) strategy is introduced to maximumly leverage the semantic and discriminative information from the training data. We trained the model with LUS data of 233 patients, and validated it with 80 patients. Our method can effectively combine the two modalities and achieve accuracy of 75.0% for 4-level patient severity assessment, and 87.5% for the binary severe/non-severe identification. Besides, our method also provides interpretation of the severity assessment by grading each of the lung zone (with accuracy of 85.28%) and identifying the pathological patterns of each lung zone.

Structural information relating to p7 from multiple genotypes has been generated in silico (e.g. genotype (GT) 1a), as well as obtained from experiments in form of monomeric and hexameric structures (GTs 1b and 5a, respectively). However, sequence diversity and structural differences mean that comparison of their channel gating behaviour has not thus far been simulated. Here, a molecular model of the monomeric GT 1a protein is optimized and assembled into a hexameric bundle for comparison with both the 5a hexamer structure and another hexameric bundle generated using the GT 1b monomer structure. All bundles tend to turn into a compact structure during molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (Gromos96 (ffG45a3)) in hydrated lipid bilayers, as well as when simulated at ‘low pH’, which may trigger channel opening according to some functional studies. Both GT 1a and 1b channel models are gated via movement of the parallel aligned helices, yet the scenario for the GT 5a protein is more complex, with a short N-terminal helix being involved. However, all bundles display pulsatile dynamics identified by monitoring water dynamics within the pore.","Kalita, Monoj Mon; Griffin, Stephen; Chou, James J.; Fischer, Wolfgang B.",Biochim Biophys Acta Biomembr,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005273615000772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25772504/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0005273615000772; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamem.2015.03.006,653
604408,Impact of international travel and border control measures on the global spread of the novel 2019 coronavirus outbreak,2020-03-31,"BACKGROUND: This is the concluding paper of our 11-paper supplement, “Community health workers at the dawn of a new era”. METHODS: We relied on our collective experience, an extensive body of literature about community health workers (CHWs), and the other papers in this supplement to identify the most pressing challenges facing CHW programmes and approaches for strengthening CHW programmes. RESULTS: CHWs are increasingly being recognized as a critical resource for achieving national and global health goals. These goals include achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals of Universal Health Coverage, ending preventable child and maternal deaths, and making a major contribution to the control of HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and noncommunicable diseases. CHWs can also play a critical role in responding to current and future pandemics. For these reasons, we argue that CHWs are now at the dawn of a new era. While CHW programmes have long been an underfunded afterthought, they are now front and centre as the emerging foundation of health systems. Despite this increased attention, CHW programmes continue to face the same pressing challenges: inadequate financing, lack of supplies and commodities, low compensation of CHWs, and inadequate supervision. We outline approaches for strengthening CHW programmes, arguing that their enormous potential will only be realized when investment and health system support matches rhetoric. Rigorous monitoring, evaluation, and implementation research are also needed to enable CHW programmes to continuously improve their quality and effectiveness. CONCLUSION: A marked increase in sustainable funding for CHW programmes is needed, and this will require increased domestic political support for prioritizing CHW programmes as economies grow and additional health-related funding becomes available. The paradigm shift called for here will be an important step in accelerating progress in achieving current global health goals and in reaching the goal of Health for All.","Perry, Henry B.; Chowdhury, Mushtaque; Were, Miriam; LeBan, Karen; Crigler, Lauren; Lewin, Simon; Musoke, David; Kok, Maryse; Scott, Kerry; Ballard, Madeleine; Hodgins, Steve",Health Res Policy Syst,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-021-00755-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34641891/,653

This study evaluated change in psychological adjustment and insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The sample included 192 adults from Utah who completed three data collection cycles across 9 consecutive months to assess self-reported depressive, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed via the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8). Insomnia was measured by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Data were analyzed using mixed-effect modeling and adjusted for anxiety and depression to determine their independent effects on insomnia symptoms. Spaghetti plots examined mean changes over time and significance was set at p<0.05. Average anxiety, depression, and insomnia severity scores were aggregated for each month. RESULTS: As participants’ symptoms of anxiety and depression increased in severity, insomnia symptoms increased similarly. Over half of participants reported clinically significant ISI scores (59.38%). In both the random intercept and random slope models, there were significant independent effects of anxiety on insomnia severity (F=20.69; p<0.0001) and significant effects of depression on insomnia severity (F=87.44, p<0.0001). While the change in insomnia severity over time was on the boundary of statistical significance (F=3.54; p=0.0618), dropping from 15.17 (April) to 12.58 (December), our longitudinal analyses revealed no significant difference for the effect of anxiety or depression in predicting insomnia severity over time. Participants’ monthly averages varied for sleep and psychological scores (ISI) from 12.58 to 16.07 (SD=3.76 to 6.34 for December and September, respectively), (GAD-7) from 3.47 to 6.39 (SD=3.36 to 5.26 for December and June, respectively), and (PHQ-8) 4.47 to 6.10 (SD=4.65 to 4.39 for December and June, respectively). CONCLUSION: Results demonstrate high prevalence of insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and underscore the importance of examining mental health functioning and psychological resiliency on sleep in order to enhance prevention efforts in response to a significant stressor.

614894,A network-based explanation of why most COVID-19 infection curves are linear,2020-09-15,"Highly accurate serological tests are key to assessing the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the level of immunity in the population. This is important to predict the current and future status of the pandemic. With the recent emergence of new and more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants, assays allowing for high throughput analysis of antibodies able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 become even more important. Here, we report the development and validation of a robust, high throughput method, which enables the assessment of antibodies inhibiting the binding between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The assay uses recombinantly produced spike-f and ACE2 and is performed in a bead array format, which allows analysis of up to 384 samples in parallel per instrument over seven hours, demanding only one hour of manual handling. The method is compared to a microneutralization assay utilising live SARS-CoV-2 and is shown to deliver highly correlating data. Further, a comparison with a serological method that measures all antibodies recognizing the spike protein shows that this type of assessment provides important insights into the neutralizing efficiency of the antibodies, especially for individuals with low antibody levels. This method can be an important and valuable tool for large-scale assessment of antibody-based neutralization, including neutralization of new spike variants that might emerge.","Mravinacova, Sara; Jönsson, Malin; Christ, Wanda; Klingström, Jonas; Yousef, Jamil; Hellström, Cecilia; Hedhammar, My; Havervall, Sebastian; Thålin, Charlotte; Pin, Elisa; Tegel, Hanna; Nilsson, Peter; Månberg, Anna; Hober, Sophia",N Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34628049/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871678421000911?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2021.10.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871678421000911,653
615602,Do face masks help? is not the question,2020-11-03,"BACKGROUND: Zinc is an essential micronutrient for maintaining biological activity. The level of zinc in the blood is known to decrease with age, especially in those over 75 years of age. In older adults patients with impaired functional status, aspiration pneumonia based on dysphagia often becomes problematic. However, the relationship between zinc deficiency and swallowing function has not been studied before. METHODS: A total of 52 older adults subjects (15 males and 37 females) living in a nursing home were enrolled for this study. At the time of enrollment, data of gender, age, body weight, serum zinc levels, serum albumin levels, and the time in a simple 2-step swallowing provocation test (S-SPT) were collected. In patients with serum zinc levels < 60 μg/dL, we initiated 2 months of oral zinc supplementation therapy with a 34 mg/day zinc load. Those who underwent zinc supplementation were re-evaluated after the treatment period and serum zinc levels and S-SPT time were measured. RESULTS: At the time of enrollment, serum zinc level was significantly correlated with serum albumin levels (Pearson’s R = 0.58, p < 0.0001) and time in the S-SPT (Spearman’s rho = − 0.32, p = 0.0219). Twenty-five of the 52 patients had zinc deficiency with a serum zinc level < 60 μg/dL. After 2 months of oral zinc supplementation, both serum zinc levels (p < 0.0001) and time in the S-SPT (p = 0.04) significantly improved. Meanwhile, serum albumin level (p = 0.48) or body weight (p = 0.07) did not significantly change following zinc supplementation. Zinc supplementation significantly improved swallowing function, especially in the older adults who had comorbid dysphagia and zinc deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Zinc deficiency is associated with compromised swallowing function in older adults patients with impaired general functions. Oral zinc supplementation can alleviate dysphagia in older adults patients with zinc deficiency even though this is a retrospective study. Further study will be needed to confirm this positive effect.

The advent of fifth-generation (5G) wireless systems has the potential to revolutionize teleophthalmology, but these systems have not previously been leveraged to conduct therapeutic telemedicine in the ophthalmology field. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of 5G real-time laser photocoagulation as a telemedicine-based treatment for diabetic retinopathy (DR). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a prospective study involving a retinal specialist from the Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing, China, who performed online 5G real-time navigated retinal laser photocoagulation to treat participants with proliferative or severe nonproliferative DR who had been recruited in the Huzhou First People’s Hospital in Zhejiang Province, China, located 1200 km from Beijing from October 2019 to July 2020. INTERVENTIONS: These teleretinal DR and laser management procedures were conducted using a teleophthalmology platform that used the videoconference platform for teleconsultation, after which telelaser planning and intervention were conducted with a laser system and a platform for remote computer control, which were connected via 5G networks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Diabetic eye prognosis and the real-time laser therapy transmission speed were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 6 participants (9 eyes) were included. Six eyes were treated via panretinal photocoagulation alone, while 1 eye underwent focal/grid photocoagulation and 2 eyes underwent both panretinal photocoagulation and focal/grid photocoagulation. The mean (SD) age was 53.7 (13.6) years (range, 32-67 years). The mean (SD) duration of diabetes was 14.3 (6.4) years (range, 3-20 years). The mean (SD) logMAR at baseline was 0.32 (0.20) (20/30 Snellen equivalent). Retinal telephotocoagulation operations were performed on all eyes without any noticeable delay during treatment. The mean (SD) number of panretinal photocoagulation laser spots per eye in 1 session was 913 (243). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study introduces a novel teleophthalmology paradigm to treat DR at a distance. Applying novel technologies may continue to ensure that remote patients with DR and other conditions have access to essential health care. Further studies will be needed to compare this approach with the current standard of care to determine whether visual acuity or safety outcomes differ.","Chen, Huan; Pan, Xuefeng; Yang, Jingyuan; Fan, Jing; Qin, Mingwei; Sun, Hu; Liu, Jinxin; Li, Na; Ting, Daniel Shu Wei; Chen, Youxin",JAMA Ophthalmol,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2021.2312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34236391/,653

Each year 25–34 calves were sampled weekly from 3 days to one month of age in order to characterize oocyst output, Cryptosporidium species and clinical features associated with infection. Faecal samples were screened for the presence of oocysts using immunofluorescence analysis. DNA was extracted from positive samples and a PCR SSU rRNA followed by RFLP or sequencing was performed. For the subtyping of C. parvum, a gp60 PCR was carried out. Regardless of the year, 92–100% of the animals excreted oocysts on at least one sampling date. Depending on the year of observation, the age of highest prevalence varied. In contrast, the peak of excretion was systematically observed almost at the same age (2nd–3rd week of life) with excretion levels ranging from between 100 and 1.7 × 10(7) oocysts/g of faeces. Differences concerning clinical signs depending on the year of sampling were observed. Different species patterns were observed, with a predominance of C. bovis in the 1st year and a predominance of C. parvum in the last year. Moreover, two zoonotic subtypes of C. parvum, IIaA15G2R1 and IIaA18G2R1, were recorded in different years.

Although the cause of COVID-19 was quickly identified to be a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the world was poorly prepared for preventing its spread. One important pillar of preparedness is surveillance of the sources of emerging pathogens and responding appropriately to prevent their spread in the human population. The ever-increasing interaction between humans and animals is one leading factor in facilitating the emergence of new pathogens. In this viewpoint, we discuss the possibility of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2, highlight the importance of understanding human-animal interaction to improve preparedness for future outbreaks, and outline recommendations for prevention.","Hassani, Asma; Khan, Gulfaraz",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2196/22117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33001837/,653
652218,Coronavirus endoribonuclease targets viral polyuridine sequences to evade activating host sensors,2020-04-07,"The evolutionary mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 viruses adapt to mammalian hosts and, potentially, undergo antigenic evolution depend on the ways genetic variation is generated and selected within and between individual hosts. Using domestic cats as a model, we show that SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences remain largely unchanged over time within hosts, while dynamic sub-consensus diversity reveals processes of genetic drift and weak purifying selection. We further identify a notable variant at amino acid position 655 in Spike (H655Y), which was previously shown to confer escape from human monoclonal antibodies. This variant arises rapidly and persists at intermediate frequencies in index cats. It also becomes fixed following transmission in two of three pairs. These dynamics suggest this site may be under positive selection in this system and illustrate how a variant can quickly arise and become fixed in parallel across multiple transmission pairs. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in cats involved a narrow bottleneck, with new infections founded by fewer than ten viruses. In RNA virus evolution, stochastic processes like narrow transmission bottlenecks and genetic drift typically act to constrain the overall pace of adaptive evolution. Our data suggest that here, positive selection in index cats followed by a narrow transmission bottleneck may have instead accelerated the fixation of S H655Y, a potentially beneficial SARS-CoV-2 variant. Overall, our study suggests species- and context-specific adaptations are likely to continue to emerge. This underscores the importance of continued genomic surveillance for new SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as heightened scrutiny for signatures of SARS-CoV-2 positive selection in humans and mammalian model systems.","Braun, Katarina M.; Moreno, Gage K.; Halfmann, Peter J.; Hodcroft, Emma B.; Baker, David A.; Boehm, Emma C.; Weiler, Andrea M.; Haj, Amelia K.; Hatta, Masato; Chiba, Shiho; Maemura, Tadashi; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Koelle, Katia; O’Connor, David H.; Friedrich, Thomas C.",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33635912/,653

659028,Task complexity moderates group synergy,2021-09-07,"BACKGROUND: Interest is growing in digital and telehealth delivery of mental health services, but data are scarce on outcomes in routine care. The federally funded Australian MindSpot Clinic provides online and telephone psychological assessment and treatment services to Australian adults. We aimed to summarise demographic characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients registered with MindSpot over the first 7 years of clinic operation. METHODS: We used an observational design to review all patients who registered for assessment with the MindSpot Clinic between Jan 1, 2013, and Dec 31, 2019. We descriptively analysed the demographics, service preferences, and baseline symptoms of patients. Among patients enrolled in a digital treatment course, we evaluated scales of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale [GAD-7]), as primary measures of treatment outcome, from the screening assessment to post-treatment and a 3 month follow-up. The Kessler Psychological Distress 10-Item Plus Scale was also used to assess changes in general distress and disability, and course satisfaction was measured post-treatment. OUTCOMES: A total of 121 652 screening assessments were started, of which 96 018 (78·9%) were completed. The mean age of patients was 35·7 years (SD 13·8) and 88 702 (72·9%) were women. Based on available assessment data, 36 866 (34·5%) of 106 811 participants had never previously spoken to a health professional about their symptoms, and most people self-reported symptoms of anxiety (88 879 [81·9%] of 108 494) or depression (78 803 [72·6%] of 108 494), either alone or in combination, at baseline. 21 745 patients started treatment in a therapist-guided online course, of whom 14 503 (66·7%) completed treatment (≥four of five lessons). Key trends in service use included an increase in the proportion of people using MindSpot primarily for assessment and information, from 52·6% in 2013 to 66·7% in 2019, while the proportion primarily seeking online treatment decreased, from 42·6% in 2013 to 26·7% in 2019. Effect sizes and percentage changes were large for estimated mean scores on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 from assessment to post-treatment (PHQ-9, Cohen's d effect size 1·40 [95% CI 1·37–1·43]; and GAD-7, 1·45 [1·42–1·47]) and the 3 month follow-up (PHQ-9, 1·36 [1·34–1·38]; and GAD-7, 1·42 [1·40–1·44]); proportions of patients with reliable symptom deterioration (score increase of ≥6 points [PHQ-9] or ≥5 points [GAD-7]) were low post-treatment (of 13 058 respondents, 184 [1·4%] had symptom deterioration on the PHQ-9 and 282 [2·2%] on the GAD-7); and patient satisfaction rates were high (12 452 [96·6%] of 12 895 respondents would recommend the course and 12 433 [96·7%] of 12 860 reported the course worthwhile). We also observed small improvements in disability following treatment as measured by days out of role. INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate improvement in psychological symptoms and positive reception among patients receiving online mental health treatment. These results support the addition of digital services such as MindSpot as a component in contemporary national mental health systems.

661410,Ozone pollution in the North China Plain spreading into the late-winter haze season,2021-03-09,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a global, public health concern that affects humans, animals and the environment. The UK Fleming Fund’s Commonwealth Partnerships for Antimicrobial Stewardship (CwPAMS) scheme aimed to support antimicrobial stewardship initiatives to tackle AMR through a health partnership model that utilises volunteers. There is evidence to indicate that NHS staff participating in international health projects develop leadership skills. Running in parallel with the CwPAMS scheme was the first Chief Pharmaceutical Officer’s Global Health (CPhOGH) Fellowship for pharmacists in the UK. In this manuscript, we evaluate the impact, if any, of participation in the CwPAMS scheme and the CPhOGH Fellowship, particularly in relation to leadership skills, and consider if there are demonstrable benefits for the NHS. The 16 CPhOGH Fellows were invited to complete anonymised baseline and post-Fellowship self-assessment. This considered the impact of the Fellowship on personal, professional and leadership development. Senior colleagues were invited to provide insights into how the Fellows had performed over the course of the Fellowship. All Fellows responded to both the pre- and post-Fellowship questionnaires with a return of 100% (16/16) response rate. There was a significant improvement in Fellows’ perception of their confidence, teaching abilities, understanding of behaviour change, management and communication skills. However, there was no change in the Fellows’ attitude to work. Feedback was received from 26 senior colleagues for 14 of the CPhOGH Fellows. Overall, senior colleagues considered CPhOGH Fellows to progress from proficient/established competencies to strong/excellent when using the national pharmacy Peer Assessment Tool and NHS Healthcare Leadership Model. The majority (88%) of senior colleagues would recommend the Fellowship to other pharmacists. The analysis of the data provided suggests that this CPhOGH Fellowship led to the upskilling of more confident, motivated pharmacist leaders with a passion for global health. This supports the NHS’s long-term plan “to strengthen and support good compassionate and diverse leadership at all levels”. Constructive feedback was received for improvements to the Fellowship. Job satisfaction and motivation improved, with seven CPhOGH Fellows reporting a change in job role and five receiving a promotion.","Brandish, Claire; Garraghan, Frances; Ng, Bee Yean; Russell-Hobbs, Kate; Olaoye, Omotayo; Ashiru-Oredope, Diane",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9070890; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34356268/,653

We tested whether pre-pandemic HDL-C within the normal range is associated with subsequent COVID-19 hospitalisations and death. We analysed data on participants from UK Biobank, a prospective cohort study, baseline data for which were collected between 2006 and 2010. Follow-up for COVID-19 was via hospitalisation records (1845 events in 317,306 individuals) and a national mortality registry (458 deaths in 317,833 individuals). After controlling for a series of confounding factors which included health behaviours, inflammatory markers, and socio-economic status, higher levels of HDL-C were related to a lower risk of later hospitalisation. The effect was linear (p-value for trend 0.001), whereby a 0.2 mmol/L increase in HDL-C was associated with a 7% lower risk (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 0.93; 0.90, 0.96). Corresponding relationships for mortality were markedly weaker, such that statistical significance at conventional levels were not apparent for both the linear trend (p-value 0.25) and the odds ratio per 0.2 mmol/L increase (0.98; 0.91, 1.05). While our finding for HDL-C and hospitalisations for COVID-19 raise the possibility that favourable modification of this cholesterol fraction via lifestyle changes or drug intervention may impact upon the risk of the disease, it warrants testing in other studies.","Lassale, Camille; Hamer, Mark; Hernáez, Álvaro; Gale, Catharine R.; Batty, G.

Peste des petits ruminants virus dampens host interferon-based signaling pathways through multiple mechanisms. Previous studies deciphered the role of V and C in abrogating IFN-β production. Moreover, V protein directly interacted with signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 resulting in the impairment of host IFN responses. In our present study, PPRV infection inhibited both IFN-β- and IFN-γ-induced activation of IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and IFN-γ-activated site (GAS) element, respectively. Both N and P proteins, functioning as novel IFN response antagonists, markedly suppressed IFN-β-induced ISRE and IFN-γ-induced GAS promoter activation to impair downstream upregulation of various interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and prevent STAT1 nuclear translocation. Specifically, P protein interacted with STAT1 and subsequently inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation, whereas N protein neither interacted with STAT1 nor inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation as well as dimerization, suggesting that the N and P protein antagonistic effects were different. Though they differed in their relationship to STAT1, both proteins blocked JAK-STAT signaling, severely negating the host antiviral immune response. Our study revealed a new mechanism employed by PPRV to evade host innate immune response, providing a platform to study the interaction of paramyxoviruses and host response.","Li, Pengfei; Zhu, Zixiang; Zhang, Xiangle; Dang, Wen; Li, Linlin; Du, Xiaoli; Zhang, Miaotao; Wu, Chunyan; Xue, Qinghong; Liu, Xiangtao; Zheng, Haixue; Nan, Yuchen",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v11070629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288481/,653
669793,Reply to Arora et al.: Concerns and considerations about using the CV as an equity tool,2020,"Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methyl-anthraquinone) is a natural anthraquinone derivative that is present in numerous globally renowned herbal medicines. It is recognised as a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor and as an anticancer drug, active against various tumour cells, including lung, breast, liver, and ovarian cancer cells. Recently, its role in combination chemotherapy with various allopathic medicines, to minimize their toxicity and to enhance their efficacy, has been studied. The use of emodin in these therapies is gaining popularity, due to fewer associated side effects compared with standard anticancer drugs. Emodin has a broad therapeutic window, and in addition to its antineoplastic activity, it displays anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, antimicrobial, muscle relaxant, immunosuppressive and antifibrotic activities, in both in vitro and in vivo models. Although reviews on the anticancer activity of emodin have been published, none coherently unite all the pharmacological properties of emodin, particularly the anti-oxidant, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, immunosuppressive and hepatoprotective activities of the compound. Hence, in this review, all of the available data regarding the pharmacological properties of emodin are explored, with particular emphasis on the modes of action of the molecule. In addition, the manuscript details the occurrence, biosynthesis and chemical synthesis of the compound, as well as its toxic effects on biotic systems.","Semwal, Ruchi Badoni; Semwal, Deepak Kumar; Combrinck, Sandra; Viljoen, Alvaro",Phytochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2021.112854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34311280/,653

Since then, many countries have experienced the rapid transmission of this respiratory disease among their populations and have exercised many strategies to mitigate the spread of this disease. The prediction of the transmission dynamics serves important roles in designing mitigation strategies. However, due to the unknown characteristics of this disease, as well as the geographical and political factors, building efficient models of the dynamics for many countries is difficult. The objective of this study is to develop a transmission dynamics predictor that takes advantage of the time differences among many countries with respect to transmission of this disease, in that some countries experienced earlier outbreaks than others. The primary novelty of the proposed method is that, unlike many existing transmission predictors that require parameters based on prior knowledge of the epidemiology of past viruses, the proposed method only requires the transmission similarities between countries in the publicly available data for this current disease. In this paper, the viability and limitations of the proposed method are reported and discussed.","Hartono, Pitoyo",Inform Med Unlocked,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352914820302689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835075/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914820302689?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2020.100386,653

NP full practice authority could be part of a longer-term plan to address healthcare inequities and deficiencies rather than merely a crisis measure. However, the changes to support full practice authority that were enacted to address COVID-19 are temporary and will be reversed when the executive orders expire.
