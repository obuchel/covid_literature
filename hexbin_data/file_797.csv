With a steep drop in customer demand and the inability of airlines to forecast demand for flights with any degree of accuracy, this paper proposes an alternative approach to revenue management that monitors key revenue management metrics and take corrective action with demand and supply levers to make the revenue plan happen. In a COVID-19 era, in the absence of reliable demand forecasts, this operationally driven robust revenue management approach is a viable alternative to manage seat inventory than traditional methods.","Vinod, B.",J Revenue Pricing Manag,797,1

This study was performed to identify its biomolecules, which are responsible for enhancement of memory. L. stoechas aqueous extract was first purified by liquid column chromatography. The purified fractions were analyzed for in vitro anti-cholinesterase activity. The fraction that produced the best anti-cholinesterase activity was named an active fraction of L. stoechas (AfL.s). This was then subjected to GC–MS for identifications of biomolecules present in it. GC–MS indicated the presence of phenethylamine and α-tocopherol in AfL.s. Different doses of AfL.s were orally administered (for seven days) to scopolamine-induced hyper-amnesic albino mice and then behavioral studies were performed on mice for two days. After that, animals were sacrificed and their brains were isolated to perform the biochemical assay. Results of behavioral studies indicated that AfL.s improved the inflexion ratio in mice, which indicated improvement in retention behavior. Similarly, AfL.s significantly (p < 0.001) reduced acetylcholinesterase and malondialdehyde contents of mice brain, but on the other hand, it improved the level of choline acetyltransferase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione. It was found that that high doses of AfL.s (≥400 mg/Kg/p.o.) produced hyper-activity, hyperstimulation, ataxia, seizures, and ultimate death in mice. Its LD(50) was calculated as 325 mg/Kg/p.o. The study concludes that α-tocopherol and phenethylamine (a primary amine) present in L. stoechas enhance memory in animal models.","Mushtaq, Aamir; Anwar, Rukhsana; Gohar, Umar Farooq; Ahmad, Mobasher; Marc (Vlaic), Romina Alina; Mureşan, Crina Carmen; Irimie, Marius; Bobescu, Elena",Plants (Basel),797,13

MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study reviewed EVTA treatments performed at an outpatient clinic (MDLSVI) from April 1999 to February 2013. Systems included 810 nm diode (hemoglobin targeting), 1,320 nm laser (water targeting) and a radiofrequency (direct thermal transfer) (RF) device. Clinical and ultrasonographic evaluation were performed before treatment and at each follow-up visit. Patients were examined yearly by Duplex ultrasonography. Success was defined as complete absence of reflux. RESULTS Analysis of 934 treatments demonstrated that although recanalization could occur over time, endovenous ablation has a very high success rate. Ablation rates were 92.5%, 85.9%, and 71.9% at 6-months, 1-year, and 5-years after procedures. Recanalization occurred in 156 out of 934 treatments (16.7%) during the follow-up period. Among three difference systems, the total ablation success rate was significantly different (P < 0.001). The 1,320 nm Nd:YAG laser (n = 502) provided the highest ablation rate compared to the radiofrequency (n = 398) and 810 nm diode (n = 34) throughout their follow-up period, which were 8, 13, and 9 years, respectively. At 1-year follow-up, successful ablation rates of RF, 810 nm, and 1,320 nm were 78.2%, 80.8%, and 93.7%, respectively. At 5-year follow-up, successful ablation rates of RF, 810 nm, and 1,320 nm were 61.7%, 65.7%, and 84.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION EVTA is very effective for ablation of the GSV and SSV. Complete ablation varied significantly among different systems with water targeting 1,320 nm providing the highest incidence saphenous vein ablation. This remained durable at 8-year follow-up by Duplex ultrasound.","Weiss, Robert A; Weiss, Margaret A; Eimpunth, Sasima; Wheeler, Sandra; Udompunturak, Suthipol; Beasley, Karen L",Lasers in surgery and medicine,797,1

Altered retinal vessel fractal dimensions may act as a surrogate marker for diseased cerebral vessels. We used a cross-sectional study to investigate fractal properties of retinal vessels in lacunar stroke. METHODS We recruited patients presenting with lacunar stroke and patients with minor cortical stroke as controls. All patients were examined by a stroke expert and had MRI at presentation. Digital retinal photographs were taken of both eyes. Monofractal and multifractal analyses were performed with custom-written semiautomated software. RESULTS We recruited 183 patients. Seventeen were excluded owing to poor photographic quality, leaving 166 patients (86 with lacunar and 80 with cortical stroke). The mean age was 67.3 years (SD 11.5 years). The patients with lacunar stroke were younger but the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and white matter hyperintensities did not differ between the groups. The mean Dbox (monofractal dimension) was 1.42 (SD 0.02), the mean D0 (multifractal dimension) 1.67 (SD 0.03). With multivariate analysis, decreased Dbox and D0 (both representing decreased branching complexity) were associated with increasing age and lacunar stroke subtype after correcting for hypertension, diabetes, stroke severity, and white matter hyperintensity scores. CONCLUSIONS Lacunar stroke subtype and increasing age are associated with decreased fractal dimensions, suggesting a loss of branching complexity. Further studies should concentrate on longitudinal associations with other manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease.","Doubal, F N; MacGillivray, T J; Patton, N; Dhillon, B; Dennis, M S; Wardlaw, J M",Neurology,797,1

Within three days following PCR diagnosis, we observed coordinated responses of CD4 and CD8 T cells, various antigen presenting cells and antibody-secreting cells in mild, but not hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This early-stage SARS-CoV-2-specific response was predominantly characterized by substantially expanded clonotypes of CD4 and less of CD8 T cells. The early-stage responses of T cells and dendritic cells were highly predictive for later seroconversion and protective antibody levels after three weeks in mild non-hospitalized, but not in hospitalized patients.

Distilled water is one of the on-demand elements in academic laboratories;however, water scarcity may eventually affect the education sector, necessitating the implementation of new policies. Human behavior, awareness, knowledge, and opinion is having an impact on water management;accordingly, a questionnaire was purposely designed and validated to assess these variables in a Malaysian public university regarding the use of non-distilled water produced by the distillation process. An exploratory factor analysis yielded four factors: “concept of green laboratory and water”, “usage of non-distilled water”, “knowledge about water distillation”, and “behavior related to water conservation”. Using the Mann–Whitney U test to compare laboratory and non-laboratory users’ responses, the variables “Knowledge”, “Behavior”, and “Opinion” revealed statistically significant differences, with laboratory users scoring higher in all four variables. Employing the Kruskal–Wallis H test in an occupation-based comparison among laboratory users, and with an additional variable “Practice”, showed that “Lecturer” has the highest mean rank for “Awareness”, “Behavior”, and “Opinion”, while “Laboratory Assistant” has the highest mean rank for “Knowledge”.

This article assesses the optimal time to invest in a new airport using real options analysis and utility theory. It also considers the option to defer and the benefits of clarifying uncertain demand. The results show that the investment opportunity value is superior to the net present value, and it would be better to defer the investment until demand reaches the threshold.

Materials and methods. Overall efficacy of treatment was analyzed in 12 patients hospitalized to ICU with the diagnosis of severe confirmed COVID-19 coronavirus infection (U07.1) complicated by bilateral multiseg-mental pneumonia. All patients received prophylactic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin. The patients were divided into two groups: 7 of them received a multi-electrolyte solution containing MSS 5 ml/kg daily for the entire ICU stay (3-10 days) as a part of therapy;5 patients received a similar volume of a conven-tional multi-electrolyte solution containing no metabolically active substrates and comprised a control group. Coagulation parameters were measured in arterial and venous blood of all patients at the following stages: 1) upon admission to the ICU;2) 2-4 hours after the first dose of heparin;3) 8-12 hours after the second dose of heparin;4) 24 hours after the beginning of intensive therapy. On the 28th day of follow-up, mortality, duration of ICU stay, and incidence of thrombotic complications in the groups were evaluated. Nonparametric methods of statistical analysis were used to assess intragroup changes and intergroup differences. Results. The group of patients administered with MSS had significantly fewer thromboembolic events during 28 days of treatment and shorter ICU stay. These patients responded faster to anticoagulant therapy, which was suggested by more distinct changes in coagulation parameters, i.e. increased APTT, persisting viable thrombocyte population, reduced D-dimer and fibrinogen levels. Conclusion. The metabolic action of succinate possibly increases endothelial resistance to damaging factors and reduces its procoagulant activity. The hypothesis requires testing in a larger clinical study with a design including laboratory evaluation of the efficacy of varying doses of the studied drug as well as aiming at eluci-dation of the mechanisms of its effect on specific pro-and anticoagulation system components.","Simutis, I.

Out of the fungal mycelium from infected leaves, collected from sunflower fields in the four Egyptian Governorates (Kafr El-Sheikh, Gharbia, Giza and El-Beheira), five isolates of powdery mildew pathogen were obtained and identified using morphological and molecular identification methods. Results: In 2019 and 2020 seasons, five biocontrol agents (Bacillus subtilis, B. pumilus, Trichoderma harzianum, T. viride and T. koningii) were used to control powdery mildew disease on sunflower plants under field conditions compared with the fungicide (Vectra 10% SC). Treatments were significantly effective for controlling the powdery mildew disease relative to the control. The best treatment for reducing disease parameters (final disease severity (FDS%), area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) and efficacy) than the control was T. koningii. Foliar application of all the tested treatments improved plant height, head and stem diameters and seed yield in relation to untreated plants (control). The components (FDS%, AUDPC and efficacy) were extracted and described approximately 95.251% of the pooled data of seasons 2019 and 2020. In such pooled data, the principal components (PC1, PC2 and PC3) of all disease parameters, plant development parameters and yield components were recorded 76.305, 86.635 and 96.265% of the total variance, respectively.

We performed a study to compare the safety, efficacy and outcomes of RFA compared to those of open surgery and laser ablation for the treatment of varicose veins. We also carried out a cost analysis of RFA compared to open surgery to assess whether RFA could help free up operating room time by being performed in an outpatient context. METHODS We conducted a systematic literature review (publication date May 2010-September 2013 for articles in English, January 1991-September 2013 for those in French). We used several checklists to measure the quality of the studies. We also collected data on costing. RESULTS The literature search identified 924 publications, of which 38 were retained for analysis: 15 literature reviews, 1 good-practice guideline and 22 new primary studies. The overall level of evidence was low to moderate owing to the limited sample sizes, lack of information on patient characteristics and lack of standardization of the outcome measures. However, the results obtained are consistent from study to study. In the short and medium term, RFA is considered as effective as open surgery or laser treatment (moderate level of evidence) and presents fewer major and minor complications than open surgery (low level of evidence). Radiofrequency ablation can be performed on an outpatient basis. We calculated that RFA would be about $110-$220 more expensive per patient than open surgery. CONCLUSION Radiofrequency ablation is a valuable alternative to open surgery and would free up operating room time in a context of low accessibility.","Poder, Thomas G; Fisette, Jean-François; Bédard, Suzanne K; Despatis, Marc-Antoine",Canadian journal of surgery.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 2009 and 2015, 12 off-clamp and 22 on-clamp RPN procedures were performed on a total of 34 patients in two centers. The main outcome parameters examined were serum creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during preoperative, immediate postoperative periods, and at postoperative 3rd months. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences between on-clamp and zero- ischemia groups regarding age, ASA score, BMI, PADUA and R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry scores, operation time and tumor size (p>0.05). Significant differences were found in the duration of hospital stay (3.8±0.9 days vs. 3.0±0.9 days) and amount of blood loss (85.9±49.6 mL vs. 183.3±176.2 mL) between the on-clamp and zero-ischemia groups (p<0.05). Statistically significant differences were found between preoperative and immediate post-operative periods, in terms of eGFR and serum creatinine levels in both groups. Moreover, statistically significant differences were found between preoperative and postoperative 3rd month periods, in the on-clamp group in terms of eGFR and serum creatinine levels. In the zero-ischemia group, the decrease in eGFR and serum creatinine levels at postoperative 3rd month relative to the preoperative period was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION Off-clamp RPN technique is superior, in short-term outcomes involving renal functions, compared to on clamp approach.

Although these tests may be a useful adjunct to a diagnostic strategy, they have a number of limitations. Because of the antibody and viral dynamics of the coronavirus, their sensitivity can be variable, especially at early time points after symptom onset. Additional data are required on the performance of the tests in the South African population, especially with regard to development and persistence of antibody responses and whether antibodies are protective against reinfection. These tests may, however, be useful in guiding the public health response, providing data for research (including seroprevalence surveys and vaccine initiatives) and development of therapeutic strategies.","Mayne, E S; Scott, L; Semete, B; Julsing, A; Jugwanth, S; Mampeule, N; David, A; Gededzha, M P; Goga, A; Hardie, D; Preiser, W; Chetty, K; Rees, H; Sanne, I; Mlisana, K; George, J A; Stevens, W",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,797,20

These sequences were compared with corresponding astrovirus sequences available in the nucleic acid databases, including sequences of the seven other HAstV serotypes, two other avian astroviruses (TAstV-2 and avian nephritis virus) and astrovirus from cat (FAstV). A 35 nt stem-loop motif near the 3'-end of the genome, previously described as being highly conserved, was present in all of the astroviruses except TAstV-2. In the N-terminal half of the capsid precursor protein, there were several short conserved peptide motifs. Otherwise the capsid proteins of astroviruses infecting different hosts were highly divergent. Calculation of genetic distances revealed that the distance between FAstV and HAstV is comparable to the largest distances between different HAstV serotypes. Higher similarities between the HAstV, FAstV and PAstV capsid sequences suggest interspecies transmissions involving humans, cats and pigs relatively recently in the evolutionary history of astroviruses.","Jonassen, C M; Jonassen, T O; Saif, Y M; Snodgrass, D R; Ushijima, H; Shimizu, M; Grinde, B",The Journal of general virology,797,20

More specifically, mobile devices have afforded users with endless possibilities. This upsurge in mobile technology has altered the way people use and interact with their device. One such example is how these devices are being utilized for the purposes of learning due to social distancing guidelines. Thus, it becomes important to explore and understand those factors that will influence the use of mobile devices for learning. The purpose of this study was to explore variables that might influence the adoption of mobile devices among nursing faculty. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology served as the theoretical basis for this study and guiding framework. An exploratory quantitative survey research design was utilized to explore specific variables and their impact on mobile device adoption among participants. It was found that 85%, six of the seven research variables were statistically significant predictors of mobile device adoption. Mobile devices have the potential to leverage a wealth of resources for both users and faculty. Therefore, recommendations for developing increased use of mobile device technology for teaching and learning will be suggested.","Forehand, Jeffery W; Benson, Angela D; Chance, Kasey D; Armstrong, Brittney",Comput. inform. nurs,797,16

However, many factors influence recovery and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater, complicating data interpretation. Specifically, these factors may differentially affect the measured virus concentration, depending on the laboratory methods used to perform the test. Many laboratories add a proxy virus to wastewater samples to determine losses associated with concentration and extraction of viral RNA. While measuring recovery of a proxy virus is an important process control, in this piece, we describe the caveats and limitations to the interpretation of this control, including that it typically does not account for losses during RNA extraction. We recommend reporting the directly measured concentration data alongside the measured recovery efficiency, rather than attempting to correct the concentration for recovery efficiency. Even though the ability to directly compare SARS-CoV-2 concentrations from different sampling locations determined using different methods is limited, concentration data (uncorrected for recovery) can be useful for public health response.","Kantor, Rose S; Nelson, Kara L; Greenwald, Hannah D; Kennedy, Lauren C",Environ Sci Technol,797,20

Patients admitted in ICU with an acute COVID event present with respiratory dysfunction and are more likely to have critical illness myopathy and neuropathy (CIMN). Physiotherapy services being integral part of non-pharmacological management of any ICU was implemented for patients with COVID 19; a novel viral disease. Objective: This retrospective study was undertaken to explore the physiotherapy practices that could be implemented in patients admitted with COVID 19 in the ICU and its effect on mobility and oxygen requirement as an outcome. Methodology: Following ethical permission of institute, the data was extracted from electronic data record sheet in which daily parameters for physiotherapy intervention were recorded. Data from a single ICU and step down unit (SDU) from 5th June to 5th July 2020 was analysed. Records of patients diagnosed with COVID 19 and admitted in ICU or SDU were studied. Those in the age group of 18 to 90 years, of either gender were included. Demographic characteristics, disease severity, oxygen requirement, mobility status, physiotherapy intervention were studied. Results: 278 record sheets (110 ICU and 168 SDU) were retrospectively analysed for demographics. 44.55% of patients improved with side lying position, 37.27% with prone position and 10.91% with quarter prone position. 4.55% of patient maintained oxygenation in propped up sitting. 2.73% could not be positioned. Chest physiotherapy techniques applied were deep breathing, ACBT, paced breathing and diaphragmatic breathing. Deep intercostal pressure on NIV along with vibrations was given to 12.72% of patients in the ICU. Group therapy sessions were conducted in SDU where 50.59% patients participated. ICU mobility score showed significant improvement on Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test status on day 7 in the ICU (z=-5.99, p=0.00) and SDU (z= 7.676, p=0.00) compared to day 1. Descriptive analysis showed a definitive reduction in oxygen support requirement. Conclusion: Most common form of physiotherapy interventions in patients with Covid 19 were therapeutic positioning, early mobilization and breathing exercises. Physiotherapy intervention appears promising in facilitating early patient ambulation and discharge. This study shows that it is safe and feasible to provide early physiotherapy treatment techniques in patients with COVID-19 using appropriate measures of infection prevention and cross contamination.","Jiandani, Mariya P; Salagre, Santosh B; Kazi, Shabana; Iyer, Saraswati; Patil, Poonam; Khot, Wasim Y; Patil, Ekta; Sopariwala, Mashira",J Assoc Physicians India,797,6

In the past years, research mainly focused on understanding the role played by alpine streams' internal factors such as aquatic environmental variables, as well as physical and hydrological conditions, on the shaping of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. More recently, external factors such as terrestrial environments were included in analyses worldwide. In particular, the inherent properties constituting the ecological niche of specific species were considered as factors regulating dispersal and influencing community construction. The objective of this study was to reveal the distribution pattern and the driving factors regulating aquatic biodiversity in alpine streams. We hypothesized that the altitudinal distribution of aquatic macroinvertebrates could be explained by the interaction of the aquatic environment with both species' ecological niche and the terrestrial environment surrounding their habitat, and that rare species display a more pronounced pattern than widespread dominant species. To test these hypotheses, samples were collected from two alpine streams situated on opposite slopes of Biluo Snow Mountain in Yunnan Province, China. Results of statistical analyses showed poor explanatory power from aquatic environmental factors, while the differences in vegetation type and the ecological niche of the species played an important role in determining the distribution pattern of aquatic biodiversity. Furthermore, we found that the altitudinal distribution pattern of aquatic biodiversity exhibits a bimodal type, with rare species fitting the bimodal peaks. These findings call for a better inclusion and further investigation on the effects of the terrestrial environment on aquatic ecosystems.","Liu, Shuoran; Li, Xianfu; Tan, Lu; Fornacca, Davide; Fang, Yihao; Zhu, Lin; Rao, Caihong; Cao, Yindi; Huang, Jimin; Ren, Guopeng; Cai, Qinghua; Xiao, Wen",Sci Total Environ,797,16

We aim to identify risk factors for, and outcomes of, BSI among hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We performed a severity matched case-control study (1:1 ratio) nested in a large multicentre prospective cohort of hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Cases with BSI were identified from the cohort database. Controls were matched for age, sex and acute respiratory distress syndrome. A Cox proportional hazard ratio model was performed. RESULTS: Of 2005 patients, 100 (4.98%) presented 142 episodes of BSI, mainly caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Polymicrobial infection accounted for 23 episodes. The median time from admission to the first episode of BSI was 15 days (IQR 9-20), and the most frequent source was catheter-related infection. The characteristics of patients with and without BSI were similar, including the use of tocilizumab, corticosteroids, and combinations. In the multivariate analysis, the use of these immunomodulatory drugs was not associated with an increased risk of BSI. A Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) model showed that after adjusting for the time factor, BSI was associated with a higher in-hospital mortality risk (HR 2.59; 1.65-4.07; p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Hospital-acquired BSI in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia was uncommon and the use of immunomodulatory drugs was not associated with its development.

This study sought to understand the perspective of agricultural professionals with respect to the current state of the industry, challenges, and opportunities relevant to occupational health and safety. Additional questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in the findings as well. Eleven industry professionals were interviewed, and the transcripts were qualitatively analyzed for emergent themes following a constant comparative method. Three themes emerged in our findings: a description of the current state of occupational health and safety in the agricultural industry, barriers to improving occupational health and safety, and enablers of occupational health and safety. Each theme contained subthemes. The description of the industry encompassed regulations, inherent danger, and attitudes and education. Barriers included education, health care access, logistics, discrimination and cultural competency, economic considerations, and the labor contracting system. Enablers included education, regulations, and health care and prevention. These findings are consistent with existing literature, revealing interconnected and overlapping challenges and opportunities.

Kinocardiography (KCG) combines these techniques by measuring 12 degrees-of-freedom of body motion produced by myocardial contraction and blood flow through the cardiac chambers and major vessels. The integral of kinetic energy (iK) obtained from the linear and rotational SCG/BCG signals, and automatically computed over the cardiac cycle, is used as a marker of cardiac mechanical function. The present work systematically evaluated the test-retest (TRT) reliability of KCG iK derived from BCG/SCG signals in the short term (<15 min) and long term (3-6 h) on 60 healthy volunteers. Additionally, we investigated the difference of repeatability with different body positions. First, we found high short-term TRT reliability for KCG metrics derived from SCG and BCG recordings. Exceptions to this finding were limited to metrics computed in left lateral decubitus position where the TRT reliability was moderate-to-high. Second, we found low-to-moderate long-term TRT reliability for KCG metrics as expected and confirmed by blood pressure measurements. In summary, KCG parameters derived from BCG/SCG signals show high repeatability and should be further investigated to confirm their use for cardiac condition longitudinal monitoring.","Hossein, Amin; Rabineau, Jérémy; Gorlier, Damien; Del Rio, Jose Ignacio Juarez; van de Borne, Philippe; Migeotte, Pierre-François; Nonclercq, Antoine",Sensors (Basel),797,1

Several markers have been found to be associated with the disease severity in COVID-19 patients. However, the established markers only display modest prognostic power individually and better markers are urgently needed. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of S100A12, a prominent marker gene for bacterial infection, in the prognosis of disease severity in COVID-19 patients. To ensure the robustness of the association, a total of 1695 samples from 14 independent transcriptome datasets on sepsis, influenza infection and COVID-19 infection were examined. First, it was demonstrated that S100A12 was a marker for sepsis and severity of sepsis. Then, S100A12 was found to be a marker for severe influenza infection, and there was an upward trend of S100A12 expression as the severity level of influenza infection increased. As for COVID-19 infection, it was found that S100A12 expression was elevated in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 infection. More importantly, S100A12 expression at hospital admission was robustly correlated with future quantitative indexes of disease severity and outcome in COVID-19 patients, superior to established prognostic markers including CRP, PCT, d-dimer, ferritin, LDH and fibrinogen. Thus, S100A12 is a valuable novel prognostic marker for COVID-19 severity and deserves more attention.","Lei, Hongxing",Sci Rep,797,20

Current recommendations are to perform tracheostomy after a period of intubation of > 14 days, with two consecutive negative throat swab tests, to lower the risk of contamination to HCWs. However, specific data for this recommendation are lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate viral shedding into the environment, including HCWs, associated with bedside tracheostomy in the intensive care unit. METHODS: Samples obtained from the medical environment immediately after tracheostomy, including those from 19 surfaces, two air samples at 10 and 50 cm from the surgical site, and from the personal protective equipment (PPE) of the surgeon and assistant, were tested for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in eight cases of bedside tracheostomy. We evaluated the rate of positive tests from the different samples obtained. RESULTS: Positive samples were identified in only one of the eight cases. These were obtained for the air sample at 10 cm and from the bed handrail and urine bag. There were no positive test results from the PPE samples. The patient with positive samples had undergone early tracheostomy, at 9 days after intubation, due to a comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate that delayed tracheostomy, after an extended period of endotracheal intubation, might be a considerably less contagious procedure than early tracheostomy (defined as < 14 days after intubation).","Xu, Kai; Zhang, Xin-Hao; Long, Xiao-Bo; Lu, Xiang; Liu, Zheng",J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,797,16

Objective: We investigated COVID-19 patients with different serum calcium levels. DESIGN: We checked the serum calcium level of the patients based on days after symptom onset as well as the severity of COVID-19. We also checkeed multi-organ injuries and immune cytokines level in their blood. RESULTS: Both mild/moderate and severe critical cases we observed showed low calcium level in the early stage of viral infection, while the severe/critical cases showed significant lower calcium level than mild/moderate cases in the early stage. We also found that low calcium level related to severe/critical multi-organ injuries especially in the mild/moderate population. Proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 also correlated to calcium change in both mild/moderate and severe/critical cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding indicates that calcium balance is a primal hit of COVID-19 and a biomarker of clinical severity at the beginning of symptom onset. Calcium is closely associated with virus-associated multiple organ injuryes and the increase of inflammatory cytokines. Our results provide a new, important indicator of COVID-19 patients from mild/moderate to severe/critical: serum calcium.","Zhou, Xi; Chen, Dong; Wang, Lan; Zhao, Yuanyuan; Wei, Lai; Chen, Zhishui; Yang, Bo",Biosci. rep,797,24

In this retrospective, single-center US study of adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19, we evaluated the association of ACEI/ARB use with hospital admission. Secondary outcomes included: ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, use of inotropes, and all-cause mortality. Propensity score matching was performed to account for potential confounders. Among 590 unmatched patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 78 patients were receiving ACEI/ARB (median age 63 years and 59.7% male) and 512 patients were non-users (median age 42 years and 47.1% male).

We therefore studied T cell responses against multiple SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins in a large cohort using a simple, fast, and high-throughput approach. Methods: An automated interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) for the Nucleocapsid (NC)-, Membrane (M)-, Spike-C-terminus (SCT)-, and N-terminus-protein (SNT)-specific T cell responses was performed using fresh whole blood from study subjects with convalescent, confirmed COVID-19 (n = 177, more than 200 days post infection), exposed household members (n = 145), and unexposed controls (n = 85). SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were assessed using Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Ro-N-Ig) and Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgG) (EI-S1-IgG). Results: 156 of 177 (88%) previously PCR confirmed cases were still positive by Ro-N-Ig more than 200 days after infection. In T cells, most frequently the M-protein was targeted by 88% seropositive, PCR confirmed cases, followed by SCT (85%), NC (82%), and SNT (73%), whereas each of these antigens was recognized by less than 14% of non-exposed control subjects. Broad targeting of these structural virion proteins was characteristic of convalescent SARS-CoV-2 infection; 68% of all seropositive individuals targeted all four tested antigens. Indeed, anti-NC antibody titer correlated loosely, but significantly with the magnitude and breadth of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response. Age, sex, and body mass index were comparable between the different groups. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity correlates with broad T cell reactivity of the structural virus proteins at 200 days after infection and beyond. The SARS-CoV-2-IGRA can facilitate large scale determination of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses with high accuracy against multiple targets.","Brand, Isabel; Gilberg, Leonard; Bruger, Jan; Garí, Mercè; Wieser, Andreas; Eser, Tabea M; Frese, Jonathan; Ahmed, Mohamed I M; Rubio-Acero, Raquel; Guggenbuehl Noller, Jessica M; Castelletti, Noemi; Diekmannshemke, Jana; Thiesbrummel, Sophie; Huynh, Duc; Winter, Simon; Kroidl, Inge; Fuchs, Christiane; Hoelscher, Michael; Roider, Julia; Kobold, Sebastian; Pritsch, Michael; Geldmacher, Christof",Front Immunol,797,15

The need for oxygen therapy is an important factor determining hospital admission of these patients. Our retrospective study was designed to identify risk factors associated with the progression to oxygen requirement in COVID-19 patients. A total of 133 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to our hospital from February 22, 2020, to August 23. After excluding asymptomatic, non-Japanese, pediatric, pregnant patients and also those who needed oxygen immediately at admission, data of the remaining 84 patients were analyzed. The patients were separated into those who required oxygen after admission and those who did not, and their characteristics were compared. Age, body mass index (BMI), lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase, estimated glomerular filtration rate, glucose intolerance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were significantly different between the two groups. Multivariate analysis identified four significant and independent risk factors of oxygen requirement, including advanced age, obesity, glucose intolerance and lymphocytopenia. Dividing the patients into subgroups according to the number of these risk factors found in each patient indicated that the need for oxygen increased with higher number of these risk factors in the same individual. Our results suggest that the presence of higher number of these risk factors in COVID-19 patients is associated with future oxygen requirement and that this index can be potentially useful in triaging COVID-19 patients staying home in the context of need for hospitalization.","Okauchi, Yukiyoshi; Matsuno, Kanae; Nishida, Tsutomu; Sawada, Koichi; Kawasaki, Akiko; Ito, Naohiko; Morimura, Osamu; Otani, Yasushi; Yokoe, Masaru; Abe, Kinya; Iwahashi, Hiromi",Endocr. j,797,20

Information on the respiratory system mechanical characteristics of this disease is limited. The aim of this study is to describe the respiratory system mechanical properties of ventilated COVID-19 patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Patients consecutively admitted to the medical intensive care unit at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City, USA, from April 19 to May 1, 2020, were prospectively studied; final date of follow-up was May 1, 2020. MEASUREMENTS: At the time of first patient contact, ventilator information was collected including mode, settings, peak airway pressure, plateau pressure, and total positive end expiratory pressure. Indices of airflow resistance and respiratory system compliance were calculated and analyzed. MAIN RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 58 years. 6 out of 12 (50%) patients were female. Of the 21 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients on invasive mechanical ventilation, 9 patients who were actively breathing on the ventilator were excluded. All the patients included were on volume-control mode. Mean [±standard deviation] ventilator indices were: resistive pressure 19 [±4] cmH2O, airway resistance 20 [±4] cmH2O/L/s, and respiratory system static compliance 39 [±16] ml/cmH2O. These values are consistent with abnormally elevated resistance to airflow and reduced respiratory system compliance. Analysis of flow waveform graphics revealed a pattern consistent with airflow obstruction in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Severe respiratory failure due to COVID-19 is regularly associated with airflow obstruction.","Koppurapu, Vikas S; Puliaiev, Maksym; Doerschug, Kevin C; Schmidt, Gregory A",J Intensive Care Med,797,30

Patients access YouTube, one of the largest video databases in the world, to retrieve health-related information increasingly often. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify high-quality publishers, so-called ""channels"" that can be recommended to patients. We hypothesized that the number of views and the number of uploaded videos were indicators for the quality of the information given by a video on PD. METHODS: YouTube was searched for 8 combinations of search terms that included ""Parkinson"" in German. For each term, the first 100 search results were analyzed for source, date of upload, number of views, numbers of likes and dislikes, and comments. The view ratio (views / day) and the likes ratio (likes * 100 / [likesâ+âdislikes]) were determined to calculate the video popularity index (VPI). The global quality score (GQS) and title - content consistency index (TCCI) were assessed in a subset of videos. RESULTS: Of 800 search results, 251 videos met the inclusion criteria. The number of views or the publisher category were not indicative of higher quality video content. The number of videos uploaded by a channel was the best indicator for the quality of video content. CONCLUSION: The quality of YouTube videos relevant for PD patients is increased in channels with a high number of videos on the topic. We identified three German channels that can be recommended to PD patients who prefer video over written content.","Braczynski, Anne K; Ganse, Bergita; Ridwan, Stephanie; Schlenstedt, Christian; Schulz, Jörg B; Hoog Antink, Christoph",J Parkinsons Dis,797,18

The aim was to investigate the viral kinetics and factors associated with viral clearance during lopinavir/ritonavir-based combination treatment in non-severe patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-four patients were retrospectively enrolled. Viral RNA was detected by real-time RT-PCR assay from sputum or throat swab samples at different time points. The patterns of viral kinetics were characterized, and factors associated with rapid viral clearance, which was defined as viral RNA undetectable within two weeks, were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: All patients achieved viral RNA negativity and were discharged from the hospital. Furthermore, 48 (75%) and 16 (25%) patients achieved rapid and delayed viral clearance, respectively. The lymphocyte counts of rapid viral clearance patients (1.40 [1.20-1.80] × 109/L) were higher, when compared to delayed viral clearance patients (1.00 [0.70-1.47] × 109/L) (p=0.024). The multivariate logistic analysis revealed that high lymphocyte count (&#8805;1.3×109/L) is an independent factor associated with rapid viral clearance (OR=7.62, 95% CI=1.15-50.34, p=0.035). CONCLUSIONS: The viral shedding exhibited different patterns during treatment. Immune insufficiency is responsible for the delayed viral clearance, suggesting that an immunomodulator should be considered to promote viral clearance in patients with low lymphocyte counts.","Ding, J-G; Li, J; Hong, L; Yu, X-Q; Ye, E-L; Sun, G-Q; Zhang, X-X; Chen, L; Sun, Q-F",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,797,20

It is widely accepted that the world will not return to its prepandemic normality until safe and effective vaccines are available and a global vaccination program has been successfully implemented. Antisense RNAs are single-stranded RNAs that occur naturally or are synthetic and enable hybridizing and protein-blocking translation. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to identify target markers in the RNA of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, with a length between 21 and 28 bases that could enable the development of vaccines and therapies based on antisense RNA. We used a search algorithm in C language to compare 3159 complete nucleotide sequences from SARS-CoV-2 downloaded from the repository of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The objective was to verify whether any common sequences were present in all 3159 strains of SARS-CoV-2. In the first of three datasets (SARS-CoV-2), the algorithm found two sequences each of 21 nucleotides (Sequence 1: CTACTGAAGCCTTTGAAAAAA; Sequence 2: TGTGGTTATACCTACTAAAAA). In the second dataset (SARS-CoV) and third dataset (MERS-CoV), no sequences of size N between 21 and 28 were found. Sequence 1 and Sequence 2 were input into BLAST® ≫ blastn and recognized by the platform. The gene identified by the sequences found by the algorithm was the ORF1ab region of SARS-CoV-2. Considerable progress in antisense RNA research has been made in recent years, and great achievements in the application of antisense RNA have been observed. However, many mechanisms of antisense RNA are not yet understood. Thus, more time and money must be invested into the development of therapies for gene regulation mediated by antisense RNA to treat COVID-19 as no effective therapy for this disease has yet been found.","de Jesus, Sabrina Ferreira; Santos, Laércio Ives; Rodrigues Neto, João Felício; Vieira, Thallyta Maria; Mendes, João Batista; D'angelo, Marcos Flavio Silveira Vasconcelos; Guimaraes, André Luiz Sena",Gene,797,24

DESIGN AND METHODS: This study utilized cross‐sectional methods and the data were collected between July 15 and August 15, 2020. In the data collection, “Socio‐demographic question form,” “Covid‐19 Fear Scale,” and “Bergen Insomnia Scale” tools were used. Descriptive statistics, numbers, percentages, independent samples t test, analysis of variance test, and correlation were used on the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) 22.0 package program in evaluating the research data. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Batman University. FINDINGS: A positive correlation was found between COVID‐19 Fear Scale and the Bergen Insomnia Scale (r = .392; p = .001). The relationship between COVID‐19 Fear and Bergen Insomnia Scale score averages and nurses' educational status, income level, shift working status, the status of their relatives being diagnosed with COVID‐19, the state of being satisfied with the management of the pandemic process by the Ministry of Health, the situation of having resources in the settings where they work, the status of being in quarantine was statistically significant (p < .05). CONCLUSION: The relationship between the nurses' fear levels of COVID‐19 and their insomnia levels was moderate. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The results of this study are important in terms of understanding the nurses' fear and insomnia during the pandemic and provide data support for the proper interventions. Also, nurses working in Turkey may call for more attention and support from policymakers during the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Aslan, Sinan; Dinç, Mahmut",Perspect Psychiatr Care,797,16

CASES: A 73-year-old woman with history of ocular sarcoidosis presented HZO in the right V1 dermatome 16 days after a single booster dose of vaccination (Pfizer BioNTech). A 69-year-old woman presented HZO in her V1 left dermatome, occurring 10 days after her first dose of Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. A 72-year-old woman with no history of autoimmune pathology, candidate for cataract surgery, presented 13 days after the first dose of a Moderna mRNA vaccine with an eruption in the left V1 dermatome. All patients presented the VZV infection after their first dose of a mRNA type of vaccine. Treatment with Valacyclovir 1000 mg × 3/ day for 7–14 days was efficient in all cases. CONCLUSION: Vaccines have been reported in the past to trigger different types of side effects such as viral or flu-like symptoms. It is only logical to note many different side effects for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as the population vaccinated is exceeding any other number in history. VZV is one of the more severe side effects that can, however, be treated. It is quite obvious that, as far as mRNA vaccines are concerned, and probably also other anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, that the benefit of vaccination certainly outweighs the possible but very low risk of ocular side effects that can mostly be treated.","Papasavvas, Ioannis; de Courten, Christian; Herbort, Carl P.",J Ophthalmic Inflamm Infect,797,16

The design of novel drug-drug interaction for COVID-19 patients is an open area of research. Also, the development of the COVID-19 rapid testing kits is still a challenging task. METHODOLOGY: This review focuses on two prime challenges caused by urgent needs to effectively address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., the development of COVID-19 classification tools and drug discovery models for COVID-19 infected patients with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques such as machine learning and deep learning models. RESULTS: In this paper, various AI-based techniques are studied and evaluated by the means of applying these techniques for the prediction and diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. This study provides recommendations for future research and facilitates knowledge collection and formation on the application of the AI techniques for dealing with the COVID-19 epidemic and its consequences. CONCLUSIONS: The AI techniques can be an effective tool to tackle the epidemic caused by COVID-19. These may be utilized in four main fields such as prediction, diagnosis, drug design, and analyzing social implications for COVID-19 infected patients.","Kumar, Vijay; Singh, Dilbag; Kaur, Manjit; Damaševičius, Robertas",PeerJ Comput Sci,797,8

Reversible adsorption of solid support (RASS) is employed to immobilize DNA and facilitate its transfer into dry acetonitrile. Subsequent reaction with P(V)-based Ψ reagents takes place in high yield with exquisite selectivity for the exposed 3′ or 5′ alcohols on DNA. This two-stage process, dubbed SENDR for Synthetic Elaboration of Native DNA by RASS, can be applied to a multitude of DNA conformations and sequences with a variety of functionalized Ψ reagents to generate useful constructs.","Flood, Dillon T.; Knouse, Kyle W.; Vantourout, Julien C.; Kitamura, Seiya; Sanchez, Brittany B.; Sturgell, Emily J.; Chen, Jason S.; Wolan, Dennis W.; Baran, Phil S.; Dawson, Philip E.",ACS Cent Sci,797,1

Previously, we demonstrated a dual role of YPFS in regulating cytokine release in cultured macrophages. In this study, we elucidated the anti-inflammatory effect of YPFS that is mediated through modulating the expression of three key enzymes involved in IBD: inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IALP). In a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced chronic-inflammation model of cultured murine macrophages, YPFS treatment suppressed the activation of iNOS and COX-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, application of YPFS in cultured small intestinal enterocytes markedly induced the expression of IALP in a time-dependent manner, which might strengthen the intestinal detoxification system. A duality of YPFS in modulating the expression of iNOS and COX-2 was determined here. The expression of iNOS and COX-2 in macrophages was induced by YPFS, and this activation was partially blocked by the NF-κB-specific inhibitor BAY 11-7082, indicating a role of NF-κB signaling. These YPFS-induced changes in gene regulation strongly suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of YPFS are mediated through the regulation of inflammatory enzymes.","Du, Crystal Y.

Source specificity of the phage-based methods was first tested using 60 known non-human fecal samples from common animals, before being evaluated with 56 known human samples (municipal sewage) collected during both the rainy and dry season. SOMCPH were present in 40-90% of samples from different animal species and in 100% of sewage samples. Phages infecting Bacteroides strain GB-124 were not detected from the majority (95%) of animal samples (except in three porcine samples) and were present in 93 and 71% of the sewage samples in the rainy and dry season (Mean = 1.42 and 1.83 log(10)PFU/100mL, respectively), though at lower levels than SOMCPH (Mean = 3.27 and 3.02 log(10)PFU/100mL, respectively). Phages infecting strain ASH-08 were detected in 89 and 96% of the sewage samples in the rainy and dry season, respectively, but were also present in all animal samples tested (except goats). Strains K10, K29, and K30 were not found to be useful MST markers due to low levels of phages and/or co-presence in non-human sources. GB-124 and SOMCPH were subsequently deployed within two low-income neighborhoods to determine the levels and origin of fecal contamination in 110 environmental samples. E. coli, SOMCPH, and phages of GB-124 were detected in 68, 42, and 28% of the samples, respectively. Analyses of 166 wastewater samples from shared community toilets and 21 samples from sewage pumping stations from the same districts showed that SOMCPH were present in 100% and GB-124 phages in 31% of shared toilet samples (Median = 5.59 and <1 log(10) PFU/100 mL, respectively), and both SOMCPH and GB-124 phages were detected in 95% of pumping station samples (Median = 5.82 and 4.04 log(10) PFU/100 mL, respectively).

Indeed, several of the manifestations of COVID-19, such as inflammation, hypercoagulation, hyperferritinemia, and immune dysfunction are also reminiscent of iron overload. Although iron is essential for all living cells, free unbound iron, resulting from iron dysregulation and overload, is very reactive and potentially toxic due to its role in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS react with and damage cellular lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins, with consequent activation of either acute or chronic inflammatory processes implicated in multiple clinical conditions. Moreover, iron-catalyzed lipid damage exerts a direct causative effect on the newly discovered nonapoptotic cell death known as ferroptosis. Unlike apoptosis, ferroptosis is immunogenic and not only leads to amplified cell death but also promotes a series of reactions associated with inflammation. Iron chelators are generally safe and are proven to protect patients in clinical conditions characterized by iron overload. There is also an abundance of evidence that iron chelators possess antiviral activities. Furthermore, the naturally occurring iron chelator lactoferrin (Lf) exerts immunomodulatory as well as anti-inflammatory effects and can bind to several receptors used by coronaviruses thereby blocking their entry into host cells. Iron chelators may consequently be of high therapeutic value during the present COVID-19 pandemic.","Habib, Hosam M.; Ibrahim, Sahar; Zaim, Aamnah; Ibrahim, Wissam H.",Biomed Pharmacother,797,20

Reducing social contacts is required to stop disease spread in pandemics for which vaccines have not yet been developed. However, existing data on social contact patterns in the United States (U.S.) is limited. METHOD: We use American Time Use Survey data from 2003–2018 to describe and quantify the age-pattern of disease-relevant social contacts. For within-household contacts, we construct age-structured contact duration matrices (who spends time with whom, by age). For both within-household and non-household contacts, we also estimate the mean number and duration of contact by location. We estimate and test for differences in the age-pattern of social contacts based on demographic, temporal, and spatial characteristics. RESULTS: The mean number and duration of social contacts vary by age. The biggest gender differences in the age-pattern of social contacts are at home and at work; the former appears to be driven by caretaking responsibilities. Non-Hispanic Blacks have a shorter duration of contact and fewer social contacts than non-Hispanic Whites. This difference is largely driven by fewer and shorter contacts at home. Pre-pandemic, non-Hispanic Blacks have shorter durations of work contacts. Their jobs are more likely to require close physical proximity, so their contacts are riskier than those of non-Hispanic Whites. Hispanics have the highest number of household contacts and are also more likely to work in jobs requiring close physical proximity than non-Hispanic Whites. With the exceptions of work and school contacts, the duration of social contact is higher on weekends than on weekdays. Seasonal differences in the total duration of social contacts are driven by school-aged respondents who have significantly shorter contacts during the summer months. Contact patterns did not differ by metro status. Age patterns of social contacts were similar across regions. CONCLUSION: Social contact patterns differ by age, race and ethnicity, and gender. Other factors besides contact patterns may be driving seasonal variation in disease incidence if school-aged individuals are not an important source of transmission. Pre-pandemic, there were no spatial differences in social contacts, but this finding has likely changed during the pandemic.

Controlling for air-pollution, rainfall, temperature, demographic factors that measure population density, the proportion of the elderly, and health infrastructure including per capita health spending and the proportion of respiratory cases, does not diminish the predictive power of BMI in influencing the spatial incidence and spread of the virus. The association between adult BMI and measures of spatial outcomes is especially pronounced among educated populations in urban settings, and impervious to conditioning on differences in testing rates across states. We find that among women, BMI proxies for a range of comorbidities (hemoglobin, high blood pressure and high glucose levels) that affects the severity of the virus while among men, these health indicators are also important, as is exposure to risk of contracting the virus as measured by work propensities.

The agreement rates were excellent (kappa >0.9). Adjustment of the cutoff values could be considered through ROC curve analysis. The positive predictive values of the individual assays varied from 3.5% to 100% at a 0.1% prevalence but were as high as ≥95% when two assays were combined. Conclusions The prevalence of COVID-19 in Korea is considered to be exceptionally low at present; thus, we recommend using a combination of two or more SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays rather than a single assay. These results could help select SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays for COVID-19 seroprevalence studies in Korea.","Park, Younhee; Hong, Ki Ho; Lee, Su-Kyung; Hyun, Jungwon; Oh, Eun-Jee; Lee, Jaehyeon; Lee, Hyukmin; Song, Sang Hoon; Kee, Seung-Jung; Kwon, Gye Cheol; Kim, Su Hwan; Do, Hyeon-Nam; Kim, Ah-Ra; Lee, June-Woo; Kim, Sung Soon; Kim, Hyun Soo",Annals of laboratory medicine,797,11

Optical microfibers present a good potential in this field, however, are restricted by the sensitivity limit. This study reports the development of a 3D plasmonic nanointerface, which is made of a Cu-BTC framework supporting Cu(3-x)P nanocrystals, enhancing the optical microfiber for real-time detection and sizing of single nanoparticles. The Cu(3-x)P nanocrystals are successfully embedded in the 3D Cu-BTC framework. The localized-surface plasmon resonance is tuned to coincide with the evanescent field of the optical microfiber. The 3D Cu-BTC framework, as the scaffold of nanocrystals, confines the local resonance field on the microfiber with three dimensions, at which the binding of target nanoparticles occurs. Based on the evanescent field confinement and surface enhancement by the nanointerface, the optical microfiber sensor overcomes its sensitivity limit, and enables the detection and sizing of the individual nanoparticles. The compact size and low optical power supply of the sensor confirm its suitability as a portable device for the real-time single-nanoparticle characterization, especially for the convenient evaluation of the ultrafine particles in the environment. This work opens up an approach to overcome the sensitivity limit of the optical microfibers, as long with stimulating the portable real-time single-nanoparticle detection and sizing.","Chen, Pengwei; Huang, Yunyun; Bo, Ye; Liang, He; Xiao, Aoxiang; Guan, Bai-Ou",Chem Eng J,797,27

The study was carried out to investigate the association between the genetic polymorphisms of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) gene as well as myxovirus resistance 1 (MxA) gene and susceptibility to SARS in Chinese Han population. METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted. A collective of 66 SARS cases and 64 close contact uninfected controls were enrolled in this study. End point real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-based Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis were used to detect the single nucleic polymorphisms (SNPs) in OAS1 and MxA genes. Information on other factors associated with SARS infection was collected using a pre-tested questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were conducted. RESULTS: One polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the OAS1 gene was associated with SARS infection. Compared to AA genotype, AG and GG genotypes were found associated with a protective effect on SARS infection with ORs (95% CI) of 0.42 (0.20~0.89) and 0.30 (0.09~0.97), respectively. Also, a GT genotype at position 88 in the MxA gene promoter was associated with increased susceptibility to SARS infection compared to a GG genotype (OR = 3.06, 95% CI: 1.25~7.50). The associations of AG genotype in OAS1 and GT genotype in MxA remained significant in multivariate analyses after adjusting for SARS protective measures (OR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.14~0.98 and OR = 3.22, 95% CI: 1.13~9.18, respectively). CONCLUSION: SNPs in the OAS1 3'-UTR and MxA promoter region appear associated with host susceptibility to SARS in Chinese Han population.","He, Jing; Feng, Dan; de Vlas, Sake J; Wang, Hongwei; Fontanet, Arnaud; Zhang, Panhe; Plancoulaine, Sabine; Tang, Fang; Zhan, Lin; Yang, Hong; Wang, Tianbao; Richardus, Jan H; Habbema, J Dik F; Cao, Wuchun",BMC Infect Dis,797,2

COVID-19 has subsequently infected many people and caused many deaths worldwide. Isolating infected people is one of the methods of preventing the spread of this virus. CT scans provide detailed imaging of the lungs and assist radiologists in diagnosing COVID-19 in hospitals. However, a person’s CT scan contains hundreds of slides, and the diagnosis of COVID-19 using such scans can lead to delays in hospitals. Artificial intelligence techniques could assist radiologists with rapidly and accurately detecting COVID-19 infection from these scans. This paper proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) approach to classify COVID-19 and normal CT volumes. The proposed AI method uses the ResNet-50 deep learning model to predict COVID-19 on each CT image of a 3D CT scan. Then, this AI method fuses image-level predictions to diagnose COVID-19 on a 3D CT volume. We show that the proposed deep learning model provides [Formula: see text] AUC value for detecting COVID-19 on CT scans.","Serte, Sertan; Demirel, Hasan",Comput Biol Med,797,10

We aimed to understand the degree to which office and virtual primary care changed, and for which patients and physicians, during the initial months of the pandemic in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: This population-based study compared comprehensive, linked primary care physician billing data from Jan. 1 to July 28, 2020, with the same period in 2019. We identified Ontario residents with at least 1 office or virtual (telephone or video) visit during the study period. We compared trends in total physician visits, office visits and virtual visits before COVID-19 with trends after pandemic-related public health measures changed the delivery of care, according to various patient and physician characteristics. We used interrupted time series analysis to compare trends in the early and later halves of the COVID-19 period. RESULTS: Compared with 2019, total primary care visits between March and July 2020 decreased by 28.0%, from 7.66 to 5.51 per 1000 people/day. The smallest declines were among patients with the highest expected health care use (8.3%), those who could not be attributed to a primary care physician (10.2%), and older adults (19.1%). In contrast, total visits in rural areas increased by 6.4%. Office visits declined by 79.1% and virtual care increased 56-fold, comprising 71.1% of primary care physician visits. The lowest uptake of virtual care was among children (57.6%), rural residents (60.6%) and physicians with panels of ≥ 2500 patients (66.0%). INTERPRETATION: Primary care in Ontario saw large shifts from office to virtual care over the first 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Total visits declined least among those with higher health care needs. The determinants and consequences of these major shifts in care require further study.","Glazier, Richard H.; Green, Michael E.; Wu, Fangyun C.; Frymire, Eliot; Kopp, Alexander; Kiran, Tara",CMAJ,797,24

To detect and study the evolution of PEDV and PDCoV in central China (Shanxi, Henan, Hubei province), 70 clinical intestinal and fecal samples from piglets with severe watery diarrhea during August 2015 and June 2016 were collected, tested and analyzed. PEDV was more frequently detected by PCR than PDCoV. Phylogenetic analysis of S genes showed that the 10 PEDV strains from this study clustered into G2a (n = 7) and G2b (n = 3) groups. Additionally, the three G2b strains (PEDV S2△) contained the same specific 3 nt deletion in S2 as other reference strains in G2b. Interestingly, complete genome analysis indicated that CH/hubei/2016 was closer to the US INDEL strain and G2a group. CH/hubei/2016 had one recombination event in S2 gene which may have resulted from AH2012-12 (from G2b group) and CH-ZMDZY-11 (from G2a group). Furthermore, 10 purifying selection sites in S gene indicated an adaptive evolution of PEDV in central China swine herds. These results suggested that Pandemic G2a and G2b are predominant PEDV genotype circulating in central China. In addition, the deletion and recombination identified in S gene suggested PEDV strains of central exhibited an evolutionary variety. However, whether these changes affect the pathogenicity and antigenicity of wild PEDV is unknown and is worth for further investigation.","Li, Dongliang; Feng, Hua; Liu, Yunchao; Chen, Yumei; Wei, Qiang; Wang, Juan; Liu, Dongmin; Huang, Huimin; Su, Yunfang; Wang, Dongyu; Cui, Yinglei; Zhang, Gaiping",Res Vet Sci,797,23

The most general concept to begin with is the most important—the microbiological purity of the starting viral culture. For every virus antigen, there should be a parallel normal antigen to serve as the negative control in the test. Normal antigens are prepared by shaminoculating cell cultures with negative culture material and following these cultures through the entire virus culture and antigen preparation steps in exact parallel fashion. Depending on the test and the day-to-day usage, many antigens are preserved by adding thimerosal to the final product to a final concentration of 1:10,000, or sodium azide to a final concentration of 0.1%. Special preparation of antigens is required for many diagnostic tests, monoclonal or polyclonal antibody production, and many enzyme immunoassays tests. Many viruses and antigens have their own peculiarities based on the specific properties of each virus group. Chromatography is considered to be the most effective means of producing purified preparations of virus proteins, this being achieved by gel filtration, ion exchange, or affinity chromatography.","Hierholzer, J.

However, the need for several reagents and steps and the high cost of PCR hinder its worldwide implementation to contain the outbreak. Here, we report a cotton-tipped electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus antigen. Unlike the reported approaches, we integrated the sample collection and detection tools into a single platform by coating screen-printed electrodes with absorbing cotton padding. The immunosensor was fabricated by immobilizing the virus nucleocapsid (N) protein on carbon nanofiber-modified screen-printed electrodes which were functionalized by diazonium electrografting. The detection of the virus antigen was achieved via swabbing followed by competitive assay using a fixed amount of N protein antibody in the solution. A square wave voltammetric technique was used for the detection. The limit of detection for our electrochemical biosensor was 0.8 pg/mL for SARS-CoV-2, indicating very good sensitivity for the sensor. The biosensor did not show significant cross-reactivity with other virus antigens such as influenza A and HCoV, indicating high selectivity of the method. Moreover, the biosensor was successfully applied for the detection of the virus antigen in spiked nasal samples showing excellent recovery percentages. Thus, our electrochemical immunosensor is a promising diagnostic tool for the direct rapid detection of the COVID-19 virus that requires no sample transfer or pretreatment.","Eissa, Shimaa; Zourob, Mohammed",Anal Chem,797,20

The aim of this study was to explore patient attitudes to surgery and theatre efficiency as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and assess a potential framework for the delivery of such services. METHODS: Prospectively collected data on theatre timings and procedures completed per session used to assess theatre efficiency comparing June 2019 to June 2020. Information on patient compliance with 14-day household isolation and attitudes to surgery were collected prospectively over a seven-week period using a questionnaire. Follow-up data were collected via telephone consultation a minimum of two weeks after discharge. RESULTS: Significant reduction in the number of points per session (p = 0.02) with a mean of 3.19 in 2019 and 2.42 in 2020. Only 18 of 31 patients were compliant with pre-operative isolation with individual failures accounting for four of 13 and failures by household members accounting for nine. Impact of COVID-19 and precautions on patient anxiety was mixed. No patients required symptomatic COVID-19 swab post-operatively. CONCLUSION: With the restrictions of COVID-19, there are significant problems with theatre efficiency, in effect losing an operation a list. Furthermore, compliance with pre-operative isolation was poor but to the best of our knowledge no patients became unwell from COVID-19 post-operatively. Additional strategies will be required to reinstate an effective elective orthopaedic service, especially as the nation heads into another wave.","Sharkey, S.; Narang, K.; Pacheco, R.

Cohort studies among general population are needed for targeted preventive actions but remain scarce. We quantify and qualify the HLIs collected prospectively in the MAVIE (Mutualists against Home and Leisure Injuries) observatory, a web-based cohort among volunteers of the French general population. METHODS: Participants reported HLIs from November 2014 to December 2019. We calculated crude and standardized incidence rates (SIRs) on the entire cohort, for each of the selected socio-demographic variables and each of the injury circumstances (place and activity), mechanisms, and injury severity levels. We also described other HLIs characteristics and consequences. RESULTS: Out of the 29,931 household members enrolled in the cohort, 12,419 participants completed the questionnaires. Among them, 8640 participants provided follow-up data, leading to a follow-up of 6302 persons for 5.2 years and 2483 HLIs were reported. We obtained a SIR of 85.0 HLIs per 1000 persons-years. Most reported injuries did not require emergency department attendance or hospitalization (64%). SIRs were higher in children (< 15 years of age) (109.1 HLIs per 1000 persons-years; 95% CI, 78.2–140.1) and adults aged 70 years and older (123.7 HLIs per 1000 persons-years; 95% CI, 79.2–168.3). Struck or hit by fall was the most frequent injury mechanism (52%) and also among the most severe injuries (73% of Struck or hit by fall HLIs ending with hospitalization). Sport (without contact with nature), and leisure and play activities were the injury circumstances with higher SIRs, 15.2 HLIs per 1000 persons-years (95% CI, 14.6–15.8) and 11.2 HLIs per 1000 persons-years (95% CI, 10.7–11.6), respectively. Outdoor sport activity (in contact with nature) was the circumstance with the highest proportion of hospitalizations (18% of outdoor sports HLIs ending with hospitalization). CONCLUSION: The incidences, causes, and consequences of HLI differ by age group and are mainly related to the performance of certain activities. Although the participants in the MAVIE cohort were not representative of the French population. Our study identified potential sub-populations and specific types of HLIs that should be targeted by future studies concerning risk factors and prevention programs.
