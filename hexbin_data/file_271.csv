1180,A Literature Review and Survey of Childhood Pneumonia Etiology Studies: 2000–2010,2012-04-01,"The Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) project is the largest multicountry etiology study of childhood pneumonia since the Board on Science and Technology in International Development studies of the 1980s. However, it is not the only recent or ongoing pneumonia etiology study, and even with seven sites, it cannot capture all epidemiologic settings in the developing world. Funding providers, researchers and policymakers rely on the best available evidence to strategically plan programs, new research directions and interventions. We aimed to describe the current landscape of recent pneumonia etiology studies in children under 5 years of age in the developed and developing world, as ascertained by a literature review of relevant studies with data since the year 2000 and a survey of researchers in the field of childhood pneumonia. We collected information on the study population, study design, case definitions, laboratory samples and methods and identified pathogens. A literature review identified 88 studies with child pneumonia etiology results. As of June 2010, our survey of researchers identified an additional 65 ongoing and recently completed child pneumonia etiology studies. This demonstrates the broad existing context into which the PERCH study must be placed. However, the landscape analysis also reveals a multiplicity of case definitions, levels of clinician involvement, facility types, specimen collection, and laboratory techniques. It reinforces the need for the standardization of methods and analyses for present and future pneumonia etiology studies in order to optimize their cumulative potential to accurately describe the microbial causes of childhood pneumonia.","Gilani, Zunera; Kwong, Yuenting D.; Levine, Orin S.; Deloria-Knoll, Maria; Scott, J.

7218,Review of the Literature and Proposed Guidelines for the Use of Oral Ribavirin as Postexposure Prophylaxis for Lassa Fever,2010-12-15,"Background. Induction of heat shock proteins (HSP), i.e. of the major family member HSP70, is an important cytoprotective-resistance mechanism for monocytes/ macrophages (Mphi). Patients on haemodialysis present with a high infectious morbidity and enhanced carcinoma incidence. Renal insufficiency-related alteration of microbicidal and tumoricidal functions of Mphi, major effectors of the immune system, might promote these diseases. Methods. Freshly isolated Mphi from Sprague–Dawley rats 2 weeks after 5/6-nephrectomy and from patients on intermittent haemodialysis (IHD) were stimulated by heat shock (HS) and compared to stimulated Mphi of control rats or healthy volunteers (CTR). Expression of HSP72 (inducible HSP70) was assessed by RT-PCR, and/or flow cytometry. Apoptosis of Mphi was detected by flow cytometry (CD14/annexin V-labelling). Results. In rat Mphi, baseline HSP72 expression was similar in both groups, but its induction was significantly impaired in renal insufficiency (214 ± 68% less HSP70-mRNA versus CTR, n = 6). In patients, HSF-1-mRNA and HSP72-mRNA/protein response to HS was significantly lower, but not affected by dialysis session itself. In parallel, apoptosis of Mphi of patients was enhanced (+83 ± 29% constitutive apoptotic Mphi versus CTR, n = 8), and HS-dependent protection from apoptosis with and without serum depletion (48 h depletion: HS, +275 ± 37% apoptotic Mphi versus CTR, n = 6; full medium: +166 ± 62% versus CTR, n = 8, P < 0.05) was inferior. Conclusions. Impaired HSP72 stress response of Mphi in patients on haemodialysis might contribute to the observed immune dysfunction and, therefore, to the increased susceptibility to infection and malignancy. Stress impairment is not restricted to uraemia but is already present in a rat model of chronic kidney disease.","Reuter, Stefan; Bangen, Philip; Edemir, Bayram; Hillebrand, Uta; Pavenstädt, Hermann; Heidenreich, Stefan; Lang, Detlef",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107957/,271
7229,Clinical Significance of Human Herpesvirus 6 Positivity on the FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel,2018-10-01,"BACKGROUND: Recent reports have described the contribution of adult respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections to the use of advanced healthcare resources and death. METHODS: Data regarding patients aged ≥18 years admitted to any of Maryland’s 50 acute-care hospitals were evaluated over 12 consecutive years (2001–2013). We examined RSV and influenza (flu) surveillance data from the US National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and used this information to define RSV and flu outbreak periods in the Maryland area. Outbreak periods consisted of consecutive individual weeks during which at least 10% of RSV and/or flu diagnostic tests were positive. We examined relationships of RSV and flu outbreaks to occurrence of 4 advanced medical outcomes (hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, intubated mechanical ventilation, and death) due to medically attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI). RESULTS: Occurrences of all 4 MAARI-related hospital advanced medical outcomes were consistently greater for all adult ages during RSV, flu, and combined RSV–flu outbreak periods compared to nonoutbreak periods and tended to be greatest in adults aged ≥65 years during combined RSV–flu outbreak periods. Rate ratios for all 4 MAARI-related advanced medical outcomes ranged from 1.04 to 1.38 during the RSV, flu, or combined RSV–flu outbreaks compared to the nonoutbreak periods, with all 95% lower confidence limits >1. CONCLUSIONS: Both RSV and flu outbreaks were associated with surges in MAARI-related advanced medical outcomes (hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, intubated mechanical ventilation, and death) for adults of all ages.","Zhou, James A; Schweinle, Jo Ellen; Lichenstein, Richard; Walker, Robert E; King, James C",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108153/,271

7464,Variant Effect of First- and Second-Generation Antihistamines as Clues to Their Mechanism of Action on the Sneeze Reflex in the Common Cold,2001-11-01,"Factors affecting immunogenicity of the first 2 doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) among unimmunized Mayan infants were prospectively evaluated. The relative impact of multiple variables, including mass or routine vaccination, concurrent enteric bacterial (salmonella, shigella, and campylobacter) and viral (adenovirus 40/41, astrovirus, nonpolio enteroviruses, and rotavirus) infections, interference among Sabin vaccine viruses, and preexisting poliovirus antibodies were studied. Sera were available from 181 infants after 2 OPV doses. Seroresponses were 86% to Sabin type 1, 97% to Sabin type 2, and 61% to Sabin type 3 vaccines. Mass versus routine vaccination and preexisting poliovirus antibodies did not affect immunogenicity. By multiple logistic regression analysis, fecal shedding of homologous Sabin strains was associated with increased seroresponses to all Sabin types, especially to Sabin type 3. Decreased OPV immunogenicity was primarily attributable to interference of Sabin type 3 by Sabin type 2. OPV formulations with higher doses of Sabin type 3 could improve immunogenicity among infants in developing countries.","Maldonado, Yvonne A.; Peña-Cruz, Victor; de la Luz Sanchez, Maria; Logan, Linda; Blandón, Stewart; Cantwell, Michael F.; Matsui, Suzanne M.; Millan-Velasco, Francisco; Valdespino, Jose Luis; Sepulveda, Jaime",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110245/,271
7493,CNS Manifestations Associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae Infections: Summary of Cases at the University of Helsinki and Review,1993-08-11,"We have assessed several age-sensitive indicators of immune status in young (i.e., 6 to 11-month-old) mice of a genetically heterogeneous population to see if these varied in parallel and to determine if one or more of the status indices predicted life span or cancer incidence. We report that the number of memory (i.e., CD44(hi)) T cells within the CD8 subset is correlated with number of memory cells in the CD4 population, and inversely correlated with the number of naive (i.e., CD45RB(hi)) CD4 cells at both 6 and 11 months of age, suggesting that the conversion of naive to memory cells may occur at similar rates in both T cell subsets. Mice that ranked high in the proportion of memory T cells (within the CD4 and CD8 pools) at 6 months of age tended to retain their ranking at 11 months, suggesting that the pace or extent of memory cell formation may be a consistent trait that distinguishes mice at least within a genetically heterogeneous population. Mice that at 6 months of age exhibited high levels ofCD4 or CD8 memory T cells, low levels of naive CD4 cells, or low levels of T cells able to proliferate in response to con a and 1l-2 were found to be significantly more likely than their littermates to die within the first 18 months of life. Cases offollicular cell lymphoma, lymphocytic and lymphoblastic lymphoma, and hepatic hemangiosarcoma were seen within the group of mice dying at early ages. Since each of the prognostic immune indices is characteristically seen in aged mice, we suggest that relatively precocious aging of the immune system may predispose a mouse to early death, particularly from lymphoma","Miller, Richard A.; Turke, Paul; Chrisp, Clarence; Ruger, Jennifer; Luciano, Ann; Peterson, Joyce; Chalmers, Kathy; Gorgas, Gayle; Vancise, Simi",J Gerontol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110387/,271
8085,Twenty-four hour pattern in symptom intensity of viral and allergic rhinitis: Treatment implications()()(),2005-11-30,"The 5′ nontranslated region (5′NTR) and nonstructural region nucleotide sequences of nine enzootic Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus strains were determined, thus completing the genomic RNA sequences of all prototype strains. The full-length genomes, representing VEE virus antigenic subtypes I–VI, range in size from 11.3 to 11.5 kilobases, with 48–53% overall G+C contents. Size disparities result from subtype-related differences in the number and length of direct repeats in the C-terminal nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) domain coding sequence and the 3′NTR, while G+C content disparities are attributable to strain-specific variations in base composition at the wobble position of the polyprotein codons. Highly-conserved protein components and one nonconserved protein domain constitute the VEE virus replicase polyproteins. Approximately 80% of deduced nsP1 and nsP4 amino acid residues are invariant, compared to less than 20% of C-terminal nsP3 domain residues. In two enzootic strains, C-terminal nsP3 domain sequences degenerate into little more than repetitive serine-rich blocks. Nonstructural region sequence information drawn from a cross-section of VEE virus subtypes clarifies features of alphavirus conserved sequence elements and proteinase recognition signals. As well, whole-genome comparative analysis supports the reclassification of VEE subtype-variety IF and subtype II viruses.","Meissner, John D.; Huang, Claire Y.-H.; Pfeffer, Martin; Kinney, Richard M.",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126981/,271

MDP and a nonpyrogenic analog, Murametide, inhibited the steep elevation of serum transaminases induced by MHV-3 irrespective of whether the immunomodulators were administered before or after the infection. A significant proportion of MDP or Murametide-treated animals, in contrast to controls, survived the MHV-3 infection.

11894,Editorial Commentary: Flying Under the Radar: The Stealth Pandemic of Escherichia coli Sequence Type 131,2013-11-01,"The emergence of the H7N9 virus in China is another reminder of the threat of a global influenza pandemic. Many believe we could confront a pandemic by expanding our capacity to provide timely supplies of affordable pandemic vaccines and antiviral agents. Experience in 2009 demonstrated that this cannot and will not be done. Consequently, physicians may have little more to offer their patients than they had in the 1918 pandemic. Fortunately, several modern drugs (eg, statins, angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) can modify the host response to inflammatory illness, and laboratory and clinical studies suggest they might be used to treat pandemic patients. Unfortunately, little attention has been given to the research needed to support their use in patient care. There is no guarantee these drugs will work, but physicians will never know unless those responsible for pandemic preparedness recognize and act on the extraordinary possibility that they might save lives.","Fedson, David S.",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314160/,271
11901,Editorial Commentary: Is Prepandemic Vaccination a Wise Investment?,2016-02-15,"Background. To inform planning for an influenza pandemic, we estimated US demand for N95 filtering facepiece respirators (respirators) by healthcare and emergency services personnel and need for surgical masks by pandemic patients seeking care. Methods. We used a spreadsheet-based model to estimate demand for 3 scenarios of respirator use: base case (usage approximately follows epidemic curve), intermediate demand (usage rises to epidemic peak and then remains constant), and maximum demand (all healthcare workers use respirators from pandemic onset). We assumed that in the base case scenario, up to 16 respirators would be required per day per intensive care unit patient and 8 per day per general ward patient. Outpatient healthcare workers and emergency services personnel would require 4 respirators per day. Patients would require 1.2 surgical masks per day. Results and Conclusions. Assuming that 20% to 30% of the population would become ill, 1.7 to 3.5 billion respirators would be needed in the base case scenario, 2.6 to 4.3 billion in the intermediate demand scenario, and up to 7.3 billion in the maximum demand scenario (for all scenarios, between 0.1 and 0.4 billion surgical masks would be required for patients). For pandemics with a lower attack rate and fewer cases (eg, 2009-like pandemic), the number of respirators needed would be higher because the pandemic would have longer duration. Providing these numbers of respirators and surgical masks represents a logistic challenge for US public health agencies. Public health officials must urgently consider alternative use strategies for respirators and surgical masks during a pandemic that may vary from current practices.","Carias, Cristina; Rainisch, Gabriel; Shankar, Manjunath; Adhikari, Bishwa B.; Swerdlow, David L.; Bower, William A.; Pillai, Satish K.; Meltzer, Martin I.; Koonin, Lisa M.",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314226/,271

With the rapid development of nanotechnology in the latter half of the 20th century, breakthroughs in nanomedicine and food nanotechnology using nanoparticles have been remarkable, and new applications have been developed. The technology of surfactant-coated nanoparticles, which provides new functions to nanoparticles for use in the fields of nanomedicine and food nanotechnology, is attracting a lot of attention in the fields of basic research and industry. This review systematically describes these “surfactant-coated nanoparticles” through various sections in order: 1) surfactants, 2) surfactant-coated nanoparticles, application of surfactant-coated nanoparticles to 3) nanomedicine, and 4) food nanotechnology.

18436,Impact of Key Assumptions About the Population Biology of Soil-Transmitted Helminths on the Sustainable Control of Morbidity,2021-06-14,"Domestic and captive animals and cultivated plants should be recognised as integral components in contemporary ecosystems. They interact with wild organisms through such mechanisms as hybridization, predation, herbivory, competition and disease transmission and, in many cases, define ecosystem properties. Nevertheless, it is widespread practice for data on domestic, captive and cultivated organisms to be excluded from biodiversity repositories, such as natural history collections. Furthermore, there is a lack of integration of data collected about biodiversity in disciplines, such as agriculture, veterinary science, epidemiology and invasion science. Discipline-specific data are often intentionally excluded from integrative databases in order to maintain the “purity” of data on natural processes. Rather than being beneficial, we argue that this practise of data exclusivity greatly limits the utility of discipline-specific data for applications ranging from agricultural pest management to invasion biology, infectious disease prevention and community ecology. This problem can be resolved by data providers using standards to indicate whether the observed organism is of wild or domestic origin and by integrating their data with other biodiversity data (e.g. in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility). Doing so will enable efforts to integrate the full panorama of biodiversity knowledge across related disciplines to tackle pressing societal questions.","Groom, Quentin; Adriaens, Tim; Bertolino, Sandro; Phelps, Kendra; Poelen, Jorrit H; Reeder, DeeAnn Marie; Richardson, David M; Simmons, Nancy B; Upham, Nathan",Biodivers Data J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8219659/,271
22012,Clinical Observation on the Nursing Effect of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Combined with Solution-Focused Brief Therapy in Uremic Peritoneal Dialysis Patients and Influence on Nutritional Status,2021-09-24,"PURPOSE: Oral chlorhexidine is used widely for mechanically ventilated patients to prevent pneumonia, but recent studies show an association with excess mortality. We examined whether de-adoption of chlorhexidine and parallel implementation of a standardized oral care bundle reduces intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in mechanically ventilated patients. METHODS: A stepped wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial with concurrent process evaluation in 6 ICUs in Toronto, Canada. Clusters were randomized to de-adopt chlorhexidine and implement a standardized oral care bundle at 2-month intervals. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. Secondary outcomes were time to infection-related ventilator-associated complications (IVACs), oral procedural pain and oral health dysfunction. An exploratory post hoc analysis examined time to extubation in survivors. RESULTS: A total of 3260 patients were enrolled; 1560 control, 1700 intervention. ICU mortality for the intervention and control periods were 399 (23.5%) and 330 (21.2%), respectively (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82 to 1.54; P = 0.46). Time to IVACs (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.06; 95% CI 0.44 to 2.57; P = 0.90), time to extubation (aHR 1.03; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.23; P = 0.79) (survivors) and oral procedural pain (aOR, 0.62; 95% CI 0.34 to 1.10; P = 0.10) were similar between control and intervention periods. However, oral health dysfunction scores (− 0.96; 95% CI − 1.75 to − 0.17; P = 0.02) improved in the intervention period. CONCLUSION: Among mechanically ventilated ICU patients, no benefit was observed for de-adoption of chlorhexidine and implementation of an oral care bundle on ICU mortality, IVACs, oral procedural pain, or time to extubation. The intervention may improve oral health.

Early prediction of short-term reversibility of AKI is beneficial to risk stratification and clinical treatment decision. The study sought to use machine learning methods to discriminate between transient and persistent sepsis-associated AKI. Septic patients who developed AKI within the first 48 h after ICU admission were identified from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database. AKI was classified as transient or persistent according to the Acute Disease Quality Initiative workgroup consensus. Five prediction models using logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, artificial neural network and extreme gradient boosting were constructed, and their performance was evaluated by out-of-sample testing. A simplified risk prediction model was also derived based on logistic regression and features selected by machine learning algorithms. A total of 5984 septic patients with AKI were included, 3805 (63.6%) of whom developed persistent AKI. The artificial neural network and logistic regression models achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) among the five machine learning models (0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74–0.78). The simplified 14-variable model showed adequate discrimination, with the AUC being 0.76 (95% CI 0.73–0.78). At the optimal cutoff of 0.63, the sensitivity and specificity of the simplified model were 63% and 76% respectively. In conclusion, a machine learning-based simplified prediction model including routine clinical variables could be used to differentiate between transient and persistent AKI in critically ill septic patients. An easy-to-use risk calculator can promote its widespread application in daily clinical practice.","Luo, Xiao-Qin; Yan, Ping; Zhang, Ning-Ya; Luo, Bei; Wang, Mei; Deng, Ying-Hao; Wu, Ting; Wu, Xi; Liu, Qian; Wang, Hong-Shen; Wang, Lin; Kang, Yi-Xin; Duan, Shao-Bin",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8511088/,271

22676,The characteristics and dynamic changes of X-ray chest film in 50 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome,2003,"Background: The CDC42 (Cell Division Cycle 42) gene product, CDC42, is a member of the family of small Rho GTPases, which are implicated in a broad spectrum of physiological functions in cell cycle regulation, including establishing and controlling of the cell actin cytoskeleton, vesicle trafficking, cell polarity, proliferation, motility and migration, transcription activation, reactive oxygen species production, and tumorigenesis. The CDC42 gene mutations are associated with distinct clinical phenotypes characterized by neurodevelopmental, growth, hematological, and immunological disturbances. Case presentation: We report the case of an 11-year-old boy with syndromic features, immunodeficiency, and autoinflammation who developed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and malignant lymphoproliferation. In this patient, a novel heterozygous p.Cys81Tyr mutation in the CDC42 gene was found by whole exome sequencing. Conclusions: The Cdc42 molecule plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and a wide array of tissue-specific functions, and its deregulation may result in a broad spectrum of molecular and cellular dysfunctions, making patients with CDC42 gene mutations susceptible to infections, immune dysregulation, and malignancy. In the patient studied, a syndromic phenotype with facial dysmorphism, neurodevelopmental delay, immunodeficiency, autoinflammation, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shares common features with Takenouchi–Kosaki syndrome and with C-terminal variants in CDC42. It is important to emphasize that Hodgkin's lymphoma is described for the first time in the medical literature in a pediatric patient with the novel p.Cys81Tyr mutation in the CDC42 gene. Further studies are required to delineate precisely the CDC42 genotype–phenotype correlations.","Szczawinska-Poplonyk, Aleksandra; Ploski, Rafal; Bernatowska, Ewa; Pac, Malgorzata",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7082228/,271

Under such conditions callus tissue containing several apical meristems developed. Without 2,4 D the explants were growing to aseptic small plants; when further cultivated in soil they developed into big plants showing leaves with different deformations. These leaves, aseptically cultivated plants and callus tissue were examined by light and electron microscopy. There occured two types of inclusions consisting of isometric and elongated particles, respectively. Those of the isometric type were observed in the cytoplasm of meristematic cells of the callus; the isometric particles had a diameter of about 20–22 nm and were arranged hexagonally or in curvilinear arrays. In all other tissues that were examined such aggregates were to be seen only in vacuoles. Isometric particles were also found in plasmodesmata of all tissues examined. They lay in a tubulus which protrudes into the cytoplasm on one side of the cell wall. Desmotubuli appeared only in particle-free plasmodesmata. Protrusions of the cell wall into the cytoplasm containing tubuli and isometric particles within were observed only in callus tissue and in epidermic cells of leaves. In the cell wall of callus cells, conspicuous cavities connected with the cytoplasm by plasmodesmata contained many particles which were arranged in hexagonal structures. It seemed as if they had been put away into the cell walls or into the vacuoles. The occurence of fibrillar inclusions together with those consisting of isometric particles in the same cell was extremely rare. The fibrillar inclusions were observed in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. The diameter of one fibril is about 12 nm. The thylacoids in well differentiated chloroplasts in callus and in cells of leaves are curved; single swelled thylacoids lie as vesicles in peripheral stroma. As tissues ofArmoracia rusticana plants from different localities do not contain such inclusions we assume that the root segment examined was infected with two different viruses.

However, I have emphasised the traditional mapping sentence and quantitative facet theory research. In this chapter, I concentrate on more recent forms of mapping sentences and facet theory and provide a review and examples of qualitative facet theory and the declarative mapping sentence. To achieve this, I will consider the declarative mapping sentence in greater detail and then consider its application in a study into fine art that takes into account perceptual neuroscience and visual impairment. The study employs the declarative mapping sentence to allow the investigation of the modern art trope of the grid image through theoretically reviewing extant grid images. Uniquely, the mapping sentence then provides a guide for painting a body of work, which constitutes both the investigation and validation of the mapping sentence. Other qualitative uses of the approaches are also presented. The chapter ends with suggestions for future research.","Hackett, Paul M.

We report the case of a 60-year-old man with vague gastrointestinal symptoms who waited more than 1 week to seek treatment for fear of COVID-19 infection. On presentation at another hospital, he was found to have had an anterior myocardial infarction, and he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention to stent an occluded proximal left anterior descending coronary artery.

69380,Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: Challenges and considerations.,2021-03-31,"Kidney transplantation with grafts procured after donation-after-cardiac death (DCD) has led to an increase in incidence of delayed graft function (DGF). It is thought that the warm ischemic (WI) insult encountered during DCD procurement is the cause of this finding, although few studies have been designed to definitely demonstrate this causation in a transplantation setting. Here, we use a large animal renal transplantation model to study the effects of prolonged WI during procurement on post-transplantation renal function. Kidneys from 30 kg-Yorkshire pigs were procured following increasing WI times of 0 min (Heart-Beating Donor), 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, and 120 min (n = 3-6 per group) to mimic DCD. Following 8 h of static cold storage and autotransplantation, animals were followed for 7-days. Significant renal dysfunction (SRD), resembling clinical DGF, was defined as the development of oliguria < 500 mL in 24 h from POD3-4 along with POD4 serum potassium > 6.0 mmol/L. Increasing WI times resulted in incremental elevation of post-operative serum creatinine that peaked later. DCD120min grafts had the highest and latest elevation of serum creatinine compared to all groups (POD5: 19.0 ± 1.1 mg/dL, p < 0.05). All surviving animals in this group had POD4 24 h urine output < 500 cc (mean 235 ± 172 mL) and elevated serum potassium (7.2 ± 1.1 mmol/L). Only animals in the DCD120min group fulfilled our criteria of SRD (p = 0.003), and their renal function improved by POD7 with 24 h urine output > 500 mL and POD7 serum potassium < 6.0 mmol/L distinguishing this state from primary non-function. In a transplantation survival model, this work demonstrates that prolonging WI time similar to that which occurs in DCD conditions contributes to the development of SRD that resembles clinical DGF.","Urbanellis, Peter; Mazilescu, Laura; Kollmann, Dagmar; Linares-Cervantes, Ivan; Kaths, J Moritz; Ganesh, Sujani; Oquendo, Fabiola; Sharma, Manraj; Goto, Toru; Noguchi, Yuki; John, Rohan; Konvalinka, Ana; Mucsi, Istvan; Ghanekar, Anand; Bagli, Darius; Robinson, Lisa A; Selzner, Markus",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97078-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34504136/,271

75239,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Vertical Transmission in Neonates Born to Mothers With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia.,2020-09-01,"OBJECTIVES Exhaled breath analysis by electronic nose (eNose) has shown to be a potential predictive biomarker before start of anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). We hypothesized that the eNose could also be used as an early monitoring tool to identify responders more accurately at early stage of treatment when compared to baseline. In this proof-of-concept study we aimed to definitely discriminate responders from non-responders after six weeks of treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective observational study in patients with advanced NSCLC eligible for anti-PD-1 treatment. The efficacy of treatment was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 at 3-month follow-up. We analyzed SpiroNose exhaled breath data of 94 patients (training cohort n = 62, validation cohort n = 32). Data analysis involved signal processing and statistics based on Independent Samples T-tests and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) followed by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS In the training cohort, a specificity of 73% was obtained at a 100% sensitivity level to identify objective responders. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 0.95 (CI: 0.89-1.00). In the validation cohort, these results were confirmed with an AUC of 0.97 (CI: 0.91-1.00). CONCLUSION Exhaled breath analysis by eNose early during treatment allows for a highly accurate, non-invasive and low-cost identification of advanced NSCLC patients who benefit from anti-PD-1 therapy.","Buma, Alessandra I G; Muller, Mirte; de Vries, Rianne; Sterk, Peter J; van der Noort, Vincent; Wolf-Lansdorf, Marguerite; Farzan, Niloufar; Baas, Paul; van den Heuvel, Michel M",Lung cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2021.07.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399166/,271
92665,Fentanyl and Driving Impairment.,2020-08-14,"Human parainfluenza virus type 1 (HPIV1) is a significant cause of pediatric respiratory disease in the upper and lower airways. An in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium (HAE), a useful tool for studying respiratory virus-host interactions, was used in this study to show that HPIV1 selectively infects ciliated cells within the HAE and that progeny virus is released from the apical surface with little apparent gross cytopathology. In HAE, type I interferon (IFN) is induced following infection with an HPIV1 mutant expressing defective C proteins with an F170S amino acid substitution, rHPIV1-C(F170S), but not following infection with wild-type HPIV1. IFN induction coincided with a 100- to 1,000-fold reduction in virus titer, supporting the hypothesis that the HPIV1 C proteins are critical for the inhibition of the innate immune response. Two recently characterized live attenuated HPIV1 vaccine candidates expressing mutant C proteins were also evaluated in HAE. The vaccine candidates, rHPIV1-C(R84G/Delta170)HN(T553A)L(Y942A) and rHPIV1-C(R84G/Delta170)HN(T553A)L(Delta1710-11), which contain temperature-sensitive (ts) attenuating (att) and non-ts att mutations, were highly restricted in growth in HAE at permissive (32 degrees C) and restrictive (37 degrees C) temperatures. The viruses grew slightly better at 37 degrees C than at 32 degrees C, and rHPIV1-C(R84G/Delta170)HN(T553A)L(Y942A) was less attenuated than rHPIV1-C(R84G/Delta170)HN(T553A)L(Delta1710-11). The level of replication in HAE correlated with that previously observed for African green monkeys, suggesting that the HAE model has potential as a tool for the preclinical evaluation of HPIV1 vaccines, although how these in vitro data will correlate with vaccine virus replication in seronegative human subjects remains to be seen.","Bartlett, Emmalene J; Hennessey, Margaret; Skiadopoulos, Mario H; Schmidt, Alexander C; Collins, Peter L; Murphy, Brian R; Pickles, Raymond J",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02263-07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18524813/,271

The objective of this study was to describe the long-term impact of RBP-7000 on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), subjective well-being, treatment satisfaction and medication preference in patients with schizophrenia. Patients and methods HRQoL was derived from a 52-week multicentre Phase III single-arm open-label outpatient study that assessed the safety and efficacy of RBP-7000 (120 mg) in patients with schizophrenia. HRQoL was measured using the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L and Short-Form Survey SF-36 version 2; well-being using the Subjective Well-being Under Neuroleptic Treatment - Short Version (SWN-S); satisfaction using the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire and medication preference using the Preference of Medication questionnaire. Results Of 482 participants at baseline, 234 remained through the end of study (EOS; week 52). Mean HRQoL and well-being scores remained stable between baseline (EQ-5D-5L index: 0.83; SF-36v2 Physical Component Score: 50; SF-36v2 Mental Component Score: 46; total SWN-S score: 89) and EOS (EQ-5D-5L index: 0.86; SF-36v2 Physical Component Score: 49; SF-36v2 Mental Component Score: 47; total SWN-S score: 90). The proportion of participants reporting satisfaction increased between week 4 (66%) and EOS (81%), with a similar trend for the preference of RBP-7000 over previous treatment (week 4: 66%; EOS: 72%). Sensitivity analyses suggested a minor effect of dropout on characterization of change over time in patient-reported outcomes (PRO) measures. Conclusion Study participants attained mean HRQoL scores near that of the general US population. Over two-thirds reported high satisfaction with and preference for RBP-7000 across the study period.

All English-language full-text published derivation and validation studies for risk prediction models on diabetic outcomes after bariatric surgery were included. Data extraction included population, outcomes, variables, intervention, model discrimination and calibration. RESULTS Of 2330 studies retrieved, eight met the inclusion criteria. Of these, six presented development of risk prediction models and two reported validation of existing models. All included models were developed to predict diabetes remission. Internal validation using tenfold validation was reported for one model. Two models (ABCD score and DiaRem score) had external validation using independent patient cohorts with diabetes remission assessed at 12 and 14 months respectively. Of the 11 cohorts included in the eight studies, calibration was not reported in any cohort, and discrimination was reported in two.

Sleep disturbances have been shown to be associated with poor clinical outcomes, such as a greater risk of cardiovascular disease and increasing mortality. Critically ill patients, particularly those receiving mechanical ventilation, may be more susceptible to sleep disruption. METHODS AND RESULTS Mechanical ventilation is an important factor influencing sleep in critically ill patients as it may have positive or negative effects, depending on patient population, mode, and specific settings. Other causes of sleep disruption include the acute illness itself, the daily routine care, and the effects of medications. Improving sleep in patients admitted to an intensive care unit has the potential to improve both short- and long-term clinical outcomes. In this article we review the specific aspects of sleep in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients, including abnormal sleep patterns and loss of circadian rhythm, as well as the effects of mechanical ventilation and intravenous sedatives on sleep quality and quantity.

The model involves hands-on mentorship and consists of three modules/weeks. It is recognized to be an innovative research capacity building model. In a world changed by COVID-19, where bringing people together is not viable, an innovative, interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform (e-SORT IT) for virtual implementation of SORT IT modules was created. The platform design imitated the residential course as closely as possible with the same lectures, plenary sessions, and breakout rooms. Despite the challenges, the platform performed well and even though participants and mentors were located in eight different time zones, the course was successful; 90% of participants achieved their milestones and 10 manuscripts were successfully completed. Participant evaluation revealed a satisfaction level that was nearly equivalent to the residential module. However, mentor evaluation indicated a number of shortcomings including capacity building, professional networking, communication, engagement, and contribution by participants, as well as overall module success. In conclusion, COVID-19 stimulated the creation of the e-SORT IT platform that provided a functional alternative to the residential version. Despite the limitations of reduced capacity building and networking, the e-SORT IT platform should be considered a success - it delivered the goods. This is an example of innovation and flexibility, two attributes that are sorely needed to maintain activities during the pandemic and beyond.","Davtyan, Hayk; Davtyan, Karapet; Harries, Anthony D; Reid, Anthony; Aslanyan, Garry; Khogali, Mohammed; Zachariah, Rony",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.15057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34609954/,271

METHODS Ethylene-vinyl-alcohol-copolymer specimens of different TC (10-50 %, and 100 %) were injected in an aortic phantom bearing a stent graft and endoleak cavities with simulated re-perfusion. Fluoroscopic visibility of the ethylene-vinyl-alcohol-copolymer specimens was analyzed. In addition, six radiologists analyzed endoleak visibility, and artefact intensity of ethylene-vinyl-alcohol-copolymer in CT. RESULTS Reduction of TC significantly decreased CT artefact intensity of ethylene-vinyl-alcohol-copolymer and increased visibility of endoleak re-perfusion (p < 0.000). It also significantly decreased fluoroscopic visibility of ethylene-vinyl-alcohol-copolymer (R = 0.883, p ≤ 0.01), and increased the active embolic volumes prior to visualization (Δ ≥ 40 μl). Ethylene-vinyl-alcohol-copolymer specimens with a TC of 45-50 % exhibited reasonable visibility, a low active embolic volume and a tolerable CT artefact intensity. CONCLUSIONS The developed aortic stent graft phantom allows for a reproducible simulation of embolization of endoleaks. The data suggest a reduction of the TC of ethylene-vinyl-alcohol-copolymer to 45 -50 % of the original, to interfere less with diagnostic imaging in follow-up CT examinations, while still allowing for fluoroscopic visualization.","Treitl, Karla M; Scherr, Michael; Förth, Monika; Braun, Franziska; Maxien, Daniel; Treitl, Marcus",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-014-3438-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25319348/,271

Strategies include using multiple means of communication, addressing the sensory environment, preparing participants in advance, and accounting for social context. These practical strategies are not just methodological or design choices; they are inherently related to ethical issues.

New players with important roles as triggers, facilitators and aggravators of the PD neurodegenerative process have re-emerged in the last few years, the microbes. Having evolved in association with humans for ages, microbes and their products are now seen as fundamental regulators of human physiology with disturbances in their balance being increasingly accepted to have a relevant impact on the progression of disease in general and on PD in particular. In this review, we comprehensively address early studies that have directly or indirectly linked bacteria or other infectious agents to the onset and progression of PD, from the earliest suspects to the most recent culprits, the gut microbiota. The quest for effective treatments to arrest PD progression must inevitably address the different interactions between the microbiota and human cells, and naturally consider the gut-brain axis. The comprehensive characterization of such mechanisms will help design innovative bacteriotherapeutic approaches to selectively shape the gut microbiota profile ultimately to halt PD progression. The present review describes our current understanding of the role of microorganisms and their endosymbiotic relatives, the mitochondria, in inducing, facilitating, or aggravating PD pathogenesis.","Munoz-Pinto, M F; Empadinhas, Nuno; Cardoso, Sandra M",Ageing research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2021.101396; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34171417/,271

Therefore, an accurate pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model for propofol is required to tailor depth of anaesthesia. OBJECTIVE To compare the predictive performances of the Marsh and the Schnider PK/PD models during awake craniotomy. DESIGN A prospective observational study. SETTING Single university hospital from February 2009 to May 2010. PATIENTS Twelve patients undergoing elective awake craniotomy for resection of brain tumour or epileptogenic areas. INTERVENTION Arterial blood samples were drawn at intervals and the propofol plasma concentration was determined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The prediction error, bias [median prediction error (MDPE)] and inaccuracy [median absolute prediction error (MDAPE)] of the Marsh and the Schnider models were calculated. The secondary endpoint was the prediction probability PK, by which changes in the propofol effect-site concentration (as derived from simultaneous PK/PD modelling) predicted changes in anaesthetic depth (measured by the bispectral index). RESULTS The Marsh model was associated with a significantly (P = 0.05) higher inaccuracy (MDAPE 28.9 ± 12.0%) than the Schnider model (MDAPE 21.5 ± 7.7%) and tended to reach a higher bias (MDPE Marsh -11.7 ± 14.3%, MDPE Schnider -5.4 ± 20.7%, P = 0.09). MDAPE was outside of accepted limits in six (Marsh model) and two (Schnider model) of 12 patients. The prediction probability was comparable between the Marsh (PK 0.798 ± 0.056) and the Schnider model (PK 0.787 ± 0.055), but after adjusting the models to each individual patient, the Schnider model achieved significantly higher prediction probabilities (PK 0.807 ± 0.056, P = 0.05). CONCLUSION When using the 'asleep-awake-asleep' anaesthetic technique during awake craniotomy, we advocate using the PK/PD model proposed by Schnider. Due to considerable interindividual variation, additional monitoring of anaesthetic depth is recommended.

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the inflammatory potential of dietary habits in the successful ageing of a random sample of older adults living in the Mediterranean basin and who participated in the MEDIS (MEDiterranean ISlands) study. METHODS During 2005-2016, 3,128 older adults (aged 65-100 years) from 24 Mediterranean islands and the rural Mani region (Peloponnesus) of Greece were enrolled in the study. A multidimensional successful ageing index consisting of 10 components was employed. A validated and reproducible Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) was used to evaluate the dietary habits of the older adults. A nutrition anti-inflammatory (NAI) score based on the participants' specific dietary habits was assessed. RESULTS Participants with high NAI scores (proinflammatory nutrition) had a higher prevalence of hypercholesterolemia and lower levels of successful ageing. After adjusting for several confounders, the NAI score was associated with successful ageing (-0.03, 95% CI -0.5 to -0.006). Stratified analysis by gender and advanced age revealed heterogeneity in the NAI score, predicting successful ageing. CONCLUSIONS The inflammatory potential of nutrition was reported as an important factor for successful ageing, suggesting that further research is needed on the role of anti- and proinflammatory dietary habits in healthy and successful ageing.","Tyrovolas, Stefanos; Haro, Josep Maria; Foscolou, Alexandra; Tyrovola, Dimitra; Mariolis, Anargiros; Bountziouka, Vassiliki; Piscopo, Suzanne; Valacchi, Giuseppe; Anastasiou, Foteini; Gotsis, Efthimios; Metallinos, George; Papairakleous, Natassa; Polychronopoulos, Evangelos; Matalas, Antonia-Leda; Lionis, Christos; Zeimbekis, Akis; Tur, Josep-Antoni; Sidossis, Labros S; Panagiotakos, Demosthenes B",Gerontology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000479065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28898883/,271

This stretches from prohibiting overseas travel, forbidding interstate travel, encouraging work from home closings of some public areas, compulsory wearing of marks and hand sanitisers, quarantine, social distancing, and a mixture of various actions. Malaysia in implementing its laws and regulations on COVID-19 is empowered mainly by the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988 (Act 342) together with its newly imposed COVID-19 regulations and the old Police Act 1967 (Act 344). The movement control order coupled with the social distancing measures has appeared to be the effective actions in flattening the COVID-19 curve. The study attempts to map COVID-19 as a national security matter for the benefit of public health and national security concurrently within the scope and limits of Malaysia's public health measures and prevention of diseases, in the protection of security and public order. This paper then proposed for COVID-19 and other future health crises or pandemics as national security issues. This in turn legitimising the health, security, or emergency measures, either developing on the existing laws or moving towards a more practical form of law in line with future unforeseeable threat and intervention. The Australian and Italian laws relating to COVID-19 are analysed to provide better insight and suggest solutions enabling countries facing a future emergency or crisis issues. © 2021 Osman et al..","Osman, N.

The aerosols size-dependent filtration efficiency and breathing resistance of these masks were tested before and after sterilization by five different methods for two flow rates (20 and 90?L/min) conditions corresponding to regular breathing rate and moderate/strenuous exertion, in the particle size range 0.3?10?µm. Sterilization techniques used here are autoclaving (30 and 60?minutes), dry air oven heating (30 and 60?minutes), ionizing irradiation (15 and 25 kGy), hot water washing with and without detergent and immersing in a 10% concentration of liquid hydrogen peroxide for 30?minutes. Further, the filtration efficiency of each type of masks is also studied with laboratory generated two-order higher aerosol concertation. The certified mask has the most outstanding filtering efficiency among all the other type of facemasks. The ionizing radiation causes a significant reduction in filtration efficacy, so that it is not recommended for sterilization purpose. The best method to sterilize certified N-95 masks without affecting their performance is by using dry air heating with temperature ranging from 70?80 °C. The performance of the cloth and surgical masks is found to be comparable for both flow conditions. As an affordable sterilization method, hot water washing is recommended, which does not deteriorate the fabric masks efficiency and can be used by the common people. The recommended masks for the general people are textile/fabric masks which serves fit for the purpose than non-woven masks because it can help to reduce non-biodegradable waste (facemask) and prevent respiratory droplet transmission. The non-woven mask can be sterilized with dry heat, hot water wash and autoclave.","Kumar, Amit Bhattacharjee Basundhara Sangeetha D.

E-learning has evolved as the only alternative of knowledge transmission even in third world nations, and e-assessment has been playing an increasingly important role in this digital transformation of education. But how far and of what depth it has made its place among students' minds need to be studied to leverage its full potential to transform students' learning needs. This study reports an investigation made in this direction.Design/methodology/approachAn online survey consisting of 40 questions in Google Forms was conducted to collect primary data on students' perception of e-assessment among 200 Indian students pursuing higher education from several geographical locations. The quantitative methodological approach was followed. The data were analyzed descriptively and inferentially.FindingsThe results were analyzed based on the model of acceptance and usage of e-assessment (MAUE), and findings revealed that students' overall perception toward e-assessment was of moderate level and this perception varies depending on their gender, academic level, nature of the stream of study and their economic condition. Of the eight domains investigated, students showed better perception in the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, compatibility, subjective norms and self-efficacy domains, while they cut a sorry figure in domains like awareness, resource facilitation and information technology (IT) support. It became evident from their responses that COVID was instrumental in enhancing their interest in e-assessment.Social implicationsThe implication of this study lies in strengthening e-assessment by attending to the factors as noted in the MAUE in India and alike developing nations having huge space left for e-learning to reach a boom.Originality/valueThis is an empirical investigation conducted in India on the state of students' perception of the e-assessment in the backdrop of the COVID-19 outbreak.

The detection and control of the pandemic have become necessities that require appropriate monitoring strategies. One of these strategies involves measuring and quantifying the virus in water at different stages of the Urban Water Cycle (UWC). This article presents a comprehensive literature review of the analyses and quantifications of SARS-CoV-2 in multiple UWC components from 2020 to June 2021. More than 140 studies worldwide with a focus on industrialized nations were identified, mainly in the USA, Australia, and Asia and the European Union. Wastewater treatment plants were the focus of most of these studies, followed by city sewerage systems and hospital effluents. The fewest studies examined the presence of this virus in bodies of water. Most of the studies were conducted for epidemiological purposes. However, a few focused on viral load and its removal using various treatment strategies or modelling and developing strategies to control the disease. Others compared methodologies for determining if SARS-CoV-2 was present or included risk assessments. This is the first study to emphasize the importance of the various individual components of the UWC and their potential impacts on viral transmission from the source to the public.","Peña-Guzmán, Carlos Domínguez-Sánchez María Andrea Rodríguez Manuel Pulicharla Rama Mora-Cabrera Karen",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13169010,271
183980,Severe acute respiratory syndrome: a challenge for public health practice in Hong Kong.,2003,"The first Tudor domain of PHF20L1 (PHF20L1 Tudor1) recognizes both histone methylation and non-histone methylation to play versatile roles, e.g., PHF20L1 Tudor1 binds to the oncogenic target DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) to prevent it from degradation. However, the crystal structure of the PHF20 Tudor domain, a homolog of PHF20L1, reveals a closed aromatic cage of the Tudor domain. It is thus highly desirable to interrogate the ligand-recognition mechanism of PHF20L1 Tudor1, which will in turn validate the potential druggability of this target. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the free form PHF20L1 Tudor1, which adopts the closed conformation similar to PHF20. NMR relaxation dispersion and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggest a pre-existing low-population conformation with a remarkable rearrangement of aromatic cage residues. Such structural rearrangement is further revealed by the crystal structures of PHF20L1 Tudor1 in complex with the lysine 142 methylated (K142me1) DNMT1, and a small molecule cosolvent 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), respectively. This result thus ignites interest in the discovery of small molecule inhibitors against PHF20L1 Tudor1. The hit identified from NMR fragment-based screening protrudes into the same open form aromatic cage of PHF20L1 Tudor1, and blocks the interaction between PHF20L1 Tudor1 and methylated DNMT1. Further free form crystal structures of key mutants reveal one open form and one closed form aromatic cage, which is energetically trapped observed in the NMR relaxation dispersion and MD simulations. The binding of DNMT1 with PHF20L1 Tudor1 mutants was also recapitulated in cancer cells. The mutagenesis thus alters the structure, dynamics and eventually the function of PHF20L1 Tudor1. Our results demonstrate that PHF20L1 Tudor1 utilizes the same conformational selection mechanism to recognize ligands, regardless of whether it is a natural substrate or a small molecule identified from fragment-based screening. Albeit at a low population, the pre-existing ligand-binding conformation shall shift the paradigm in the druggability assessment of a dynamic protein, even though it may lack a small molecule binding pocket in its free form structure. The inhibition of PHF20L1 paves an alternative way to target DNMT1 degradation.","Lv, Mengqi; Gao, Jia; Li, Mingwei; Ma, Rongsheng; Li, Fudong; Liu, Yaqian; Liu, Mingqing; Zhang, Jiahai; Yao, Xuebiao; Wu, Jihui; Shi, Yunyu; Tang, Yajun; Pan, Yueyin; Zhang, Zhiyong; Ruan, Ke",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.29.069500,271

187667,Osteonecrosis of hip and knee in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome treated with steroids.,2005,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW In November 2003, a new, life-threatening, respiratory illness named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) arose from Guangdong Province in China. The illness spread across the globe, caused many major outbreaks, and had an overall mortality rate of 11%. The purpose of this review is primarily to review the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of SARS, but also to comment briefly on the epidemiology and pathogen. RECENT FINDINGS SARS is caused by a novel coronavirus that primarily affects the lower respiratory tract. It starts with an influenza-like illness characterized by nonspecific, systemic symptoms. This is followed by the rapid development of a non-specific bronchopneumonia associated with lower tract respiratory symptoms, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Most patients recover after a week or 2, but some go on to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is no proven treatment, although cocktails of broad-spectrum antibiotics, antiviral, and immunomodulatory therapy have been tried. Secondary spread can be prevented and outbreaks brought under control provided that staff wear personal protective equipment and pay close attention to good personal hygiene, and patients are isolated. The most urgent needs at present are to develop a vaccine, to develop rapid, inexpensive, accurate diagnostic tests that can give results early in the illness and within a few hours of sampling. Other needs are to investigate which therapies have the lowest adverse event/efficacy ratios. SUMMARY Up-to-date knowledge of SARS should help in early detection, isolation of high-risk patients, to reduce mortality and morbidity, and to prevent a new global epidemic arising.","Rainer, Timothy H",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15071365/,271

We used our existing DNA diagnostic signature prediction pipeline, which selects regions of a target species genome that are conserved among strains of the target (for reliability, to prevent false negatives) and unique relative to other species (for specificity, to avoid false positives). We performed simulations, based on existing sequence data, to assess the number of genome sequences of a target species and of close phylogenetic relatives (near neighbors) that are required to predict diagnostic signature regions that are conserved among strains of the target species and unique relative to other bacterial and viral species. For DNA viruses such as variola (smallpox), three target genomes provide sufficient guidance for selecting species-wide signatures. Three near-neighbor genomes are critical for species specificity. In contrast, most RNA viruses require four target genomes and no near-neighbor genomes, since lack of conservation among strains is more limiting than uniqueness. Severe acute respiratory syndrome and Ebola Zaire are exceptional, as additional target genomes currently do not improve predictions, but near-neighbor sequences are urgently needed. Our results also indicate that double-stranded DNA viruses are more conserved among strains than are RNA viruses, since in most cases there was at least one conserved signature candidate for the DNA viruses and zero conserved signature candidates for the RNA viruses.","Gardner, Shea N; Lam, Marisa W; Mulakken, Nisha J; Torres, Clinton L; Smith, Jason R; Slezak, Tom R",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15583268/,271

189491,The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome on medical house staff: a qualitative study.,2005,"Coronaviruses generally have a narrow host range, infecting one or just a few species. Using targeted RNA recombination, we constructed a mutant of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in which the ectodomain of the spike glycoprotein (S) was replaced with the highly divergent ectodomain of the S protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus. The resulting chimeric virus, designated fMHV, acquired the ability to infect feline cells and simultaneously lost the ability to infect murine cells in tissue culture. This reciprocal switch of species specificity strongly supports the notion that coronavirus host cell range is determined primarily at the level of interactions between the S protein and the virus receptor. The isolation of fMHV allowed the localization of the region responsible for S protein incorporation into virions to the carboxy-terminal 64 of the 1,324 residues of this protein. This establishes a basis for further definition of elements involved in virion assembly. In addition, fMHV is potentially the ideal recipient virus for carrying out reverse genetics of MHV by targeted RNA recombination, since it presents the possibility of selecting recombinants, no matter how defective, that have regained the ability to replicate in murine cells.","Kuo, L; Godeke, G J; Raamsman, M J; Masters, P S; Rottier, P J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10627550/,271

Differences were not found across the CSTs and MISTs with regard to HR (138±25 bpm and 136±27 bpm), SpO2 (91±5% and 91±3%), perceived exertion (dyspnea=4 [3-5] and 4 [2-4.5]) and fatigue (4 [2-6] and 4 [3-5]). The CST was significantly briefer than the MIST (6.0±2.2 min and 8.6±3.0 min) and had fewer associated NOS (125±67 and 158±83). NOSs were correlated with FEV1, the 6-MWD, and HR for both tests. CONCLUSIONS The CST and MIST are reliable in patients with BCT. Patients tolerated the MIST more than the CST. Better lung function and 6-MWT scores predicted the greater NOSs and greater peak HR.","Camargo, Anderson A; Lanza, Fernanda C; Tupinambá, Thaiz; Corso, Simone D",Brazilian journal of physical therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23966142/,271
194186,"Investigation of the second wave (phase 2) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Toronto, Canada. What happened?",2008,"Ventilator-associated pneumonia is preceded by lower-respiratory-tract colonization by pathogenic microorganisms that derive from endogenous or exogenous sources. Most ventilator-associated pneumonias are the result of exogenous nosocomial colonization, especially, pneumonias caused by resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multi-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or by Legionella species or filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus. Exogenous colonization originates from a very wide variety of animate and inanimate sources in the intensive care unit environment. As a result, a strategic approach that combines measures to prevent cross-colonization with those that focus on oral hygiene and prevention of microaspiration of colonized oropharyngeal secretions should bring the greatest reduction in the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia. This review examines strategies to prevent transmission of environmental pathogens to the vulnerable mechanically-ventilated patient.","Crnich, Christopher J; Safdar, Nasia; Maki, Dennis G",Respiratory care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15913471/,271
194200,Radiographic-clinical correlation in severe acute respiratory syndrome: study of 1373 patients in Hong Kong.,2005,"White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is a devastating pathogen in shrimp aquaculture. Standardized challenge procedures using a known amount of infectious virus would assist in evaluating strategies to reduce its impact. In this study, the shrimp infectious dose 50% endpoint (SID50 ml(-1)) of a Thai isolate of WSSV was determined by intramuscular inoculation (i.m.) in 60 and 135 d old specific pathogen-free (SPF) Litopenaeus vannamei using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and 1-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Also, the lethal dose 50% endpoint (LD50 ml(-1)) was determined from the proportion of dead shrimp. The median virus infection titers in 60 and 135 d old juveniles were 10(6.8) and 10(6.5) SID50 ml(-1), respectively. These titers were not significantly different (p > or = 0.05). The titration of the WSSV stock by oral intubation in 80 d old juveniles resulted in approximately 10-fold reduction in virus titer compared to i.m. inoculation. This lower titer is probably the result of physical and chemical barriers in the digestive tract of shrimp that hinder WSSV infectivity. The titers determined by infection were identical to the titers determined by mortality in all experiments using both i.m. and oral routes at 120 h post inoculation (hpi), indicating that every infected shrimp died. The determination of WSSV titers for dilutions administered by i.m. and oral routes constitutes the first step towards the standardization of challenge procedures to evaluate strategies to reduce WSSV infection.","Escobedo-Bonilla, C M; Wille, M; Sanz, V Alday; Sorgeloos, P; Pensaert, M B; Nauwynck, H J",Diseases of aquatic organisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16231643/,271

METHODS This was a single-masked analysis of resident and transient flora of ophthalmologists before and after patient examination and after handwashing by agar imprints of the dominant hand. Standardized questionnaires were used to collect information concerning subjects' hand cleansing practices and patient load. RESULTS Of the 108 cultures, 107 (99.1%) were culture positive, yielding 15 separate organisms. Gram-negative bacilli were the most common transient flora, followed by Gram-positive cocci and fungi. Thirty-five (97.2%) ophthalmologists were culture positive for at least one resident and 8 (22.2%) ophthalmologists were culture positive for at least one transient organism, before patient contact. Regression models showed alcohol-based hand rub use, transient and resident floral load before patient contact, and patient load collectively accounted for 58.7% of the variance in resident floral load after patient contact. Use of alcohol-based hand rubs was associated with a mean resident floral reduction of 324.4 CFUs (95% confidence interval [CI] = 185.4 to 463.5; P < 0.01) and 31.6 CFUs (95% CI = 1.2 to 62.0; P < 0.05) after patient contact and handwashing, respectively. Handwashing with chlorhexidine was a significant predictor for transient floral load after handwashing (unstandardized beta = -17.2; 95% CI = -10.2 to -24.2; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The extent of contamination with pathogenic organisms after contact with eye outpatients, who have traditionally been perceived as relatively ""clean,"" was of concern. Previously identified risk factors for hand contamination in inpatient settings, such as patient load, only explained a small proportion of variance in microbial load in the ophthalmic outpatient setting.","Lam, Robert F; Hui, Mamie; Leung, Dexter Y L; Chow, Viola C Y; Lam, Ben N M; Leung, Gabriel M; Lam, Dennis S C",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16186336/,271
194586,"""Exposing the cracks"": Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and the Hong Kong health system.",2005,"OBJECTIVES To assess the association of diagnostic predictors available in the emergency department (ED) with the outcome diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS This retrospective cohort study describes all patients from the Amoy Garden complex who presented to an ED SARS screening clinic during a 2-month outbreak. Clinical and diagnostic predictors were recorded, along with ED diagnoses. Final diagnoses were established independently based on diagnostic tests performed after the ED visit. Associations of key predictors with the final diagnosis of SARS were described. RESULTS Of 821 patients, 205 had confirmed SARS, 35 undetermined SARS and 581 non-SARS. Multivariable logistic regression showed that the strongest predictors of SARS were abnormal chest x-ray (odds ratio [OR] = 17.4), subjective fever (OR = 9.7), temperature degrees >38 degrees C (OR = 6.4), myalgias (OR = 5.5), chills and rigors (OR = 4.0) and contact exposure (OR = 2.6). In a subset of 176 patients who had a complete blood cell count performed, the strongest predictors were temperature >or=38 degrees C (OR = 15.5), lymphocyte count <1000 (OR = 9.3) and abnormal chest x-ray (OR = 5.7). Diarrhea was a powerful negative predictor (OR = 0.03) of SARS. CONCLUSIONS Two components of the World Health Organization case definition - fever and contact exposure - are helpful for ED decision-making, but respiratory symptoms do not discriminate well between SARS and non-SARS. Emergency physicians should consider the presence of diarrhea, chest x-ray findings, the absolute lymphocyte count and the platelet count as significant modifiers of disease likelihood. Prospective validation of these findings in other clinical settings is desirable.","Wong, W N; Sek, Antonio C H; Lau, Rick F L; Li, K M; Leung, Joe K S; Tse, M L; Ng, Andy H W; Stenstrom, Robert J",CJEM,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17433140/,271
194656,Thin-section CT in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome following hospital discharge: preliminary experience.,2003,"INTRODUCTION Type-III interferons (IFN-λ), the most recently discovered family of IFNs, shares common features with other family members, but also has many distinctive activities. IFN-λ uniquely has a different receptor complex, and a more focused pattern of tissue expression and signaling effects, from other classes of IFNs. Multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and subsequent validation reports suggest a pivotal role for polymorphisms near the IFNL3 gene in hepatitis C clearance and control, as also for several other epithelial cell tropic viruses. Apart from its antiviral activity, IFN-λ possesses anti-tumor, immune-inflammatory and homeostatic functions. The overlapping effects of IFN-λ with type I IFN, with a restricted tissue expression pattern renders IFN-λ an attractive therapeutic target for viral infection, cancer and autoimmune diseases, with limited side effects. Areas covered: This review will summarize the current and future therapeutic opportunities offered by this most recently discovered family of interferons. Expert opinion: Our knowledge on IFN-λ is rapidly expanding. Though there are many remaining questions and challenges that require elucidation, the unique characteristics of IFN-λ increases enthusiasm that multiple therapeutic options will emerge.","Eslam, Mohammed; George, Jacob",Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27681264/,271
194896,The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome on the use of and requirements for filters in Canada.,2006,"SUMMARY This paper describes how the health surveillance protocols adopted in hospitals and nursing homes have changed in response to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its risks. These changes concern assessments that must be performed with urgency, to detect potential cases and symptoms that may indicate contagion and to protect vulnerable and hypersensitive workers. Besides, these changes have been implemented in order to regulate how the appointed occupational physician should perform everyday tasks, particularly in regard to preventive visits, periodic visits, office visits, and visits meant to authorize one's return to the workplace. This paper recommends that both preventive visits and periodic visits should include rapid antigen swab tests to screen for SARS-CoV-2 (which, if positive, should be confirmed by molecular tests) and serologic tests to detect IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Since this phase involves great risks for healthcare facilities, this paper proposes that swab testing should be performed every month and that serologic testing should be performed every three months (depending on whether the first test detects the presence of IgG antibodies). By combining antigen and molecular swab tests, healthcare professionals can diagnose workers with SARS-CoV-2 and identify positive asymptomatic cases. Because of its costs and its long turnaround times for results, molecular swab testing is recommended only when one needs to confirm a positive antigen swab test result. Serologic testing should be used alongside swab testing, to acquire data concerning the immunity of workers.","Saretto, Gianni; Bozzi, Carla",Giornale italiano di medicina del lavoro ed ergonomia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370919/,271
194958,Ventilation of wards and nosocomial outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome among healthcare workers.,2003,"The synthesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mRNAs is a complex process by which more than 30 different mRNA species are produced by alternative splicing of a single primary RNA transcript. HIV-1 splice sites are used with significantly different efficiencies, resulting in different levels of mRNA species in infected cells. Splicing of Tat mRNA, which is present at relatively low levels in infected cells, is repressed by the presence of exonic splicing silencers (ESS) within the two tat coding exons (ESS2 and ESS3). These ESS elements contain the consensus sequence PyUAG. Here we show that the efficiency of splicing at 3' splice site A2, which is used to generate Vpr mRNA, is also regulated by the presence of an ESS (ESSV), which has sequence homology to ESS2 and ESS3. Mutagenesis of the three PyUAG motifs within ESSV increases splicing at splice site A2, resulting in increased Vpr mRNA levels and reduced skipping of the noncoding exon flanked by A2 and D3. The increase in Vpr mRNA levels and the reduced skipping also occur when splice site D3 is mutated toward the consensus sequence. By in vitro splicing assays, we show that ESSV represses splicing when placed downstream of a heterologous splice site. A1, A1(B), A2, and B1 hnRNPs preferentially bind to ESSV RNA compared to ESSV mutant RNA. Each of these proteins, when added back to HeLa cell nuclear extracts depleted of ESSV-binding factors, is able to restore splicing repression. The results suggest that coordinate repression of HIV-1 RNA splicing is mediated by members of the hnRNP A/B protein family.","Bilodeau, P S; Domsic, J K; Mayeda, A; Krainer, A R; Stoltzfus, C M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11507194/,271
195355,A major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong.,2003,"The objective of this study was to quantify the extent to which the genetic diversity of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) arising over the course of infection of an individual animal becomes fixed, is transmitted to other animals, and thereby accumulates over the course of an outbreak. Complete consensus sequences of 23 genomes (each of 8,200 nucleotides) of FMDV were recovered directly from epithelium tissue acquired from 21 farms infected over a nearly 7-month period during the 2001 FMDV outbreak in the United Kingdom. An analysis of these consensus sequences revealed very few apparently ambiguous sites but clear evidence of 197 nucleotide substitutions at 191 different sites. We estimated the rate of nucleotide substitution to be 2.26 x 10(-5) per site per day (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.75 x 10(-5) to 2.80 x 10(-5)) and nucleotide substitutions to accrue in the consensus sequence at an average rate of 1.5 substitutions per farm infection. This is a sufficiently high rate showing that detailed histories of the transmission pathways can be reliably reconstructed. Coalescent methods indicated that the date at which FMDV first infected livestock in the United Kingdom was 7 February 2001 (95% CI, 20 January to 19 February 2001), which was identical to estimates obtained on the basis of purely clinical evidence. Nucleotide changes appeared to have occurred evenly across the genome, and within the open reading frame, the ratio of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous change was 0.09. The ability to recover particular transmission pathways of acutely acting RNA pathogens from genetic data will help resolve uncertainties about how virus is spread and could help in the control of future epidemics.","Cottam, Eleanor M; Haydon, Daniel T; Paton, David J; Gloster, John; Wilesmith, John W; Ferris, Nigel P; Hutchings, Geoff H; King, Donald P",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16971422/,271

196605,Entry screening for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or influenza: policy evaluation.,2005,"Arkansas (Ark)-type infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) subpopulations with an S gene sequence distinct from the vaccine predominant consensus were previously found in the upper respiratory tract of chickens within 3 days after inoculation. This finding indicated that a distinct virus subpopulation was rapidly positively selected by the chicken upper respiratory tract. We hypothesized that during host invasion, the replicating IBV population further changes as it confronts the distinct environments of different tissues, leading to selection of the most fit population. We inoculated 15-day-old chickens with 10(4) 50% embryo infective doses of an Ark-type IBV commercial vaccine via the ocular and nasal routes and characterized the sequences of the S1 gene of IBV contained in tear fluid, trachea, and reproductive tract of individual chickens at different times postinoculation. The predominant IBV phenotype contained in the vaccine (before inoculation) became a minor or nondetectable population at all times in all tissues after replication in the majority of the chickens, corroborating our previous findings. Five new predominant populations designated component (C) 1 through C5, showing distinct nonsynonymous changes, i.e., nucleotide changes resulting in different amino acids encoded and thus in a phenotypic change of the predominant virus population, were detected in the tissues or fluids of individual vaccinated chickens. Due to the different biochemical properties of some amino acids that changed in the S1 glycoprotein, we anticipate that phenotypic shift occurred during the invasion process. Significant differences were detected in the incidence of some distinct IBV predominant populations in tissues and fluids; e.g., phenotype C1 showed the highest incidence in the reproductive tract of the chickens, achieving a significant difference versus its incidence in the trachea (P < 0.05). These results indicate for the first time that IBV undergoes intraspatial variation during host invasion, i.e., the dominant genotype/phenotype further changes during host invasion as the microenvironment of distinct tissues exerts selective pressure on the replicating virus population.","Gallardo, Rodrigo A; van Santen, Vicky L; Toro, Haroldo",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20608523/,271

197584,Severe acute respiratory syndrome: prognostic implications of chest radiographic findings in 52 patients.,2004,"The importance of sialic acid for infection by avian Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has been analysed. Neuraminidase treatment rendered Vero, baby hamster kidney and primary chicken kidney cells resistant to infection by the IBV-Beaudette strain. Sialic acid-dependent infection was also observed with strain M41 of IBV, which infects primary chicken kidney cells but not cells from other species. In comparison with Influenza A virus and Sendai virus, IBV was most sensitive to pre-treatment of cells with neuraminidase. This finding suggests that IBV requires a greater amount of sialic acid on the cell surface to initiate an infection compared with the other two viruses. In previous studies, with respect to the haemagglutinating activity of IBV, it has been shown that the virus preferentially recognizes alpha2,3-linked sialic acid. In agreement with this finding, susceptibility to infection by IBV was connected to the expression of alpha2,3-linked sialic acid as indicated by the reactivity with the lectin Maackia amurensis agglutinin. Here, it is discussed that binding to sialic acid may be used by IBV for primary attachment to the cell surface; tighter binding and subsequent fusion between the viral and the cellular membrane may require interaction with a second receptor.","Winter, Christine; Schwegmann-Wessels, Christel; Cavanagh, Dave; Neumann, Ulrich; Herrler, Georg",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16603523/,271

However, multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be technologically challenging. Areas covered: This paper reports the results of the main published studies on the NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of extensive use of multiplex assays in clinical practice. Expert commentary: Currently available data seem to indicate that routine use of multiplex assays, including NxTAG RPP Assay, should be recommended only when epidemiological data concerning circulation of viruses and bacteria have to be collected. Their use in clinical practice seems debatable. They have limited sensitivity and specificity at least in the identification of some infectious agents or, as in the case of NxTAG RPP, they have not been evaluated in a sufficient number of patients to allow definitive conclusions. In the future, the clinical relevance of multiplex assays, including NxTAG RPP, could significantly increase, mainly because a number of new antiviral agents effective against several respiratory viruses for which no drug is presently available will be marketed. In addition, it is highly likely that the efficiency of multiplex assays will be significantly improved.","Esposito, Susanna; Principi, Nicola",Expert review of molecular diagnostics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27899038/,271

METHODS Retrospective observational study. RESULTS Between January 2004 and August 2020, 133 patients underwent VV-ECMO for pneumonia. This VV-ECMO cohort is representative of the geographic and ethnic distribution of the population of Aotearoa New Zealand. Six-month survival was 85/133 (64%). A primary viral aetiology was identified in 63/133 cases (47%) with bacterial co-infection present in 34/63 viral pneumonias (54%). Primary bacterial pneumonia was identified in 48/133 cases (36%). Twenty-three (17%) of 133 patients developed necrotising pneumonia. The most commonly identified microorganisms were influenza A, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Infection with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus species was strongly associated with necrotising pneumonia (OR 10.18, 95% CI 3.52-37.13, P<0.0001). Necrotising pneumonia was more common in Māori and Pacific Peoples than in other ethnic groups (OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.16-7.96, P=0.02). DISCUSSION Outcomes from VV-ECMO for pneumonia in Aotearoa New Zealand are comparable to large international series.

METHODS The mice at different developmental stages were enrolled, including fetal mice (embryonic days 14.5 and 18.5), neonatal mice (0, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days old), young mice (28 and 42 days old), and adult mice (84 days old). The lung tissues of all fetal mice from 4 pregnant mice were collected at each time point in the fetal group. Four mice were sampled in other age groups at each time point. Whole transcriptome resequencing was used to measure the mRNA expression of AGT, ACE, ACE2, Renin, Agtr1a, Agtr1b, Agtr2, and Mas1 in mouse lung tissue. RESULTS The expression of ACE2 in the lungs showed changes from embryonic stage to adult stage. It increased gradually after birth, reached a peak on day 3 after birth, and reached a nadir on day 14 after birth (P<0.05). The expression of AGT reached a peak on days 0 and 7 after birth and reached a nadir on day 21 after birth (P<0.05). The expression of ACE increased rapidly after birth and reached a peak on day 21 after birth (P<0.05). Agtr1a expression reached a peak on day 21 after birth (P<0.05). Agtr2 expression gradually decreased to a low level after birth. Renin, Agtr1b, and Mas1 showed low expression in lung tissues at all developmental stages. CONCLUSIONS At different developmental stages of mice, ACE2 has dynamic expression changes, with high expression in early neonatal and adult mice. The other key molecules of the RAS pathway have their own expression patterns. These suggest that the difference in clinical features between children and adults with COVID-19 might be associated with the different expression levels of ACE2 in the different stages, and further studies are needed for the mechanism.","Lou, Li-Li; Xie, Liang; Hu, Yu; Chen, Li-Na; Liang, Ping; Shi, Fang; Liu, Cai-Jun; Liu, Han-Min",Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33059811/,271

The aim of this study was to analyze the analgesic effect of intraperitoneal ropivacaine infusion in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. METHODS A prospective randomized clinical trial of all the patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) between January and November 2015 was performed. Patients were randomized to experimental (EG: those patients undergoing intraperitoneal ropivacain irrigation) and control groups (CG: those undergoing intraperitoneal irrigation with normal saline). RESULTS One hundred ten patients were included, 83 LRYGB (75.5 %) and 27 LSG (24.5 %). Mean pain, as measured by VAS score, was 21.7 ± 14.5 mm in CG and 13.3 ± 10.9 mm in EG (p = 0.002). Morphine needs during the first 24 h postoperatively were 21.8 % in CG and 3.6 % in EG (p = 0.01). Early taking of fluids by mouth was possible 6 h after surgery in 76.4 % in EG vs 34.5 % in CG (p = 0.001). Early mobilization ability (6 h after surgery) was feasible in 72.7 % in EG and 32.7 % in CG (p = 0.001). Median hospital stay was 3 days (range 2-10 days) in CG and 2 days (2-7 days) in EG (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS The intraoperative peritoneal infusion with ropivacaine in patients undergoing bariatric surgery is associated with a reduction in postoperative pain, lower morphine needs, earlier mobilization and earlier oral intake of fluids after surgery, and a shorter hospital stay.

We estimated basic reproduction number and transition probabilities between health states based on reported cases. Our model demonstrates that both the time of initiating an intervention and its effectiveness had a very large impact on controlling the epidemic, and the current Chinese intense social distancing intervention has reduced the impact substantially but would have been even more effective had it started earlier. The optimal duration of the control measures to avoid resurgence was estimated to be 2 months, although would need to be longer under less effective controls.","Zhang, Jiang; Dong, Lei; Zhang, Yanbo; Chen, Xinyue; Yao, Guiqing; Han, Zhangang",Nonlinear Dyn,,271

We evaluated the use of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) for the outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS & METHODS: We studied 74 patients with COVID-19. Clinical data were collected, and survival predictors were calculated. Blood was collected within 24âhours after admission (day 1) and on day 7. H2S was measured in sera by monobromobimane derivation (MBB) followed by high performance liquid chromatography and correlated to other markers like procalcitonin (PCT) and C- reactive protein (CRP). Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) and interleukin (IL)-6 were also measured in serum. RESULTS: Survivors had significantly higher H2S levels on day 1 and 7 after admission. A cut-off point of 150.44âµM could discriminate survivors from non-survivors with 80% sensitivity, 73.4% specificity and negative predictive value 95.9%. Mortality after 28 days was 32% with admission levels lower or equal to 150.44âµ&#924; and 4.1% with levels above 150.44âµ&#924; (p: 0.0008). Mortality was significantly greater among patients with a decrease of H2S levels from day 1 to day 7 greater or equal to 36% (p: 0.0005). Serum H2S on day 1 was negatively correlated with IL- 6 and CRP and positively correlated with the absolute lymphocyte count in peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that H2S is a potential marker for severity and final outcome of pneumonia by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Its correlation with IL- 6 suggests anti-inflammatory properties.","Renieris, Georgios; Katrini, Konstantina; Damoulari, Christina; Akinosoglou, Karolina; Psarrakis, Christos; Kyriakopoulou, Magdalini; Dimopoulos, George; Lada, Malvina; Koufargyris, Panagiotis; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J",Shock (Augusta Ga.),,271

The present review is primarily focused on the findings to indicate the role of ACE2 in the relationship of coronaviruses and influenza viruses to CV disease. It is postulated that the risk of coronavirus or influenza virus infection is high, at least partly due to high ACE2 expression in populations with a high CV risk. Coronavirus and influenza virus vaccine usage in high CV risk populations could be a potential strategy to prevent both CV disease and coronavirus/influenza virus infections.","Chen, Li; Hao, Guang",Cardiovasc Res,,271

Applying this algorithm to data from Greece, we extend it to the case of two subpopulations, namely, those consisting of individuals below and above 40 years of age. After supplementing the Greek data for deaths with the data for the number of individuals reported to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, we estimated the effect on deaths and infections in the case that the easing of the lockdown measures is different for these two subpopulations. We found that if the lockdown measures are partially eased only for the young subpopulation, then the effect on deaths and infections is small. However, if the easing is substantial for the older population, this effect may be catastrophic.","Fokas, A S; Cuevas-Maraver, J; Kevrekidis, P G",Sci Rep,,271

Factors associated with the decision to accept or decline the offer for anti-spike monoclonal antibody therapies are not established. This study aimed to identify factors impacting the decision to consent for monoclonal antibody therapies and assess the differences in clinical outcomes of patients who accepted compared to those who declined these therapies. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study enrolled 2820 adult patients who were offered monoclonal antibody therapies, bamlanivimab and casirivimab-imdevimab, for COVID-19 at Mayo Clinic in the Midwest between 11/19/2020 and 12/31/2020. The primary endpoint is the decision to accept or decline monoclonal antibody treatment. Secondary endpoints were patient-level factors that could have impacted the decision to accept treatment (age, gender, race, ethnicity, primary language spoken, and medical comorbidities). The main clinical endpoint was hospitalization within 28 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: 59.1% (n = 1669) chose to accept monoclonal antibody therapy, and 40.9% (n = 1151) chose to decline the offer for treatment. Patients were more likely to accept treatment if they were non-Hispanic White, English speaking, identified a spouse or life partner, had a religious affiliation, and possessed more medical comorbidities. Overall, 28-day hospitalization rate was 2.6% (n = 72/2820) and was higher among those who declined (3.3%) than those who accepted monoclonal antibody therapy (2.0%; Rate Ratio = 0.62, 95% Confidence Interval, 0.39-0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Despite having more comorbidities, patients who accepted monoclonal antibody treatments had a lower rate of hospitalization compared to patients who declined treatment. Several social and cultural factors were associated with the decision to decline therapy, including race, language, ethnicity, and lack of social support. These findings can inform public health efforts to reduce social disparities in the treatment of COVID-19 and increase utilization of monoclonal antibody therapies in high risk populations.","Bierle, Dennis M; Ganesh, Ravindra; Wilker, Caroline G; Hanson, Sara N; Moehnke, Darcie E; Jackson, Tammy A; Ramar, Priya; Rosedahl, Jordan K; Philpot, Lindsey M; Razonable, Raymund R",J Prim Care Community Health,,271

A cross-sectional study based on a web survey was conducted. The survey was sent to 123 physicians working at secondary care centres of Portugal and Spain, that participate in the INSPIRERS project. A total of 65 physicians completed the survey (53% response rate). They had a mean of 18 (11) years of clinical practice and 14% were residents. More than half were allergists (58%), 22% pulmonologists and 20% paediatricians. Most were working in Portugal (89%) and in public hospitals (88%). All were conducting consultations: 71% presential (median [p 25 ,75] duration 30 [20, 30] min), 91% telephonic (15 [10, 20] min) and 20% video consultations (20[10, 28]min). The median duration of presential consultations was significantly higher than pre-COVID-19 (20 [20, 30]min; p = 0.021). From the physicians conducting video consultations, 92% were allergists and only 54% considered that their institution provided adequate conditions. The physicians of the INSPIRERS group used telephonic consultations as the main alternative to presential ones and 1/5 used video consultations. These results suggest the need to rethink clinical follow-up services for outpatients in the near future increasing the use of telemedicine, especially video consultations.","Jácome, C; Pereira, A M; Amaral, R; Alves-Correia, M; Almeida, R; Mendes, S; Almeida Fonseca, J; Inspirers, G",Eur. ann. allergy clin. immunol,,271

237760,Preparedness of Nuclear Medicine Departments during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (COVID-19) Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: There are limited data on the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on hospitalized patients with autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disease (AICID) compared with patients who do not have AICID. We sought to evaluate whether patients with AICID who have confirmed COVID-19 presenting to the hospital are at higher risk of adverse outcomes compared with those patients without AICID who are infected with COVID-19 and whether immunosuppressive medications impact this risk. METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study with patients presenting to five hospitals in a large academic health system with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 infection. We evaluated the impact of having an AICID and class of immunosuppressive medication being used to treat patients with AICID (biologics, nonbiologic immunosuppressives, or systemic corticosteroids) on the risk of developing severe COVID-19 defined as requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) and/or death. RESULTS: A total of 6792 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in the study, with 159 (2.3%) having at least one AICID. On multivariable analysis, AICIDs were not significantly associated with severe COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9-1.8). Among patients with AICID, use of biologics or nonbiologic immunosuppressives did not increase the risk of severe COVID-19. In contrast, systemic corticosteroid use was significantly associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 (aOR 6.8, 95% CI: 2.5-18.4). CONCLUSION: Patients with AICID are not at increased risk of severe COVID-19 with the exception of those on corticosteroids. These data suggest that patients with AICID should continue on biologic and nonbiologic immunosuppression but limit steroids during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ungaro, Ryan C; Agrawal, Manasi; Park, Sarah; Hirten, Robert; Colombel, Jean-Frederic; Twyman, Kathryn; Gulko, Percio S; Klang, Eyal",,,271

Postintubation tracheal stenosis is a well-known risk of prolonged endotracheal intubation, but it is too early to define the existence of any difference among the COVID-19 cohort of patients and non-COVID-19 patients. This report is of 2 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia that required tracheostomy and prolonged endotracheal intubation, which were followed by delayed tracheal stenosis. CASE REPORT Case 1. A 54-year-old male was admitted to our hospital (Biella, Italy) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The patient underwent orotracheal intubation, progressively improving his breathing function, and was discharged after 20 days. Ten days later, the patient presented with severe respiratory distress. Computed tomography (CT) scan and bronchoscopy showed signs of tracheal stenosis. We administered intravenous steroids for 10 days. The patient showed increasing improvement in his breathing function and was discharged with no other signs of respiratory distress. Case 2. A 43-year-old male was admitted to our hospital for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient underwent orotracheal intubation, progressively improving his breathing function, and was discharged after 25 days. Eighteen days later, the patient came to our emergency room with severe respiratory distress. CT scan and bronchoscopy showed signs of tracheal stenosis. The patient had to undergo tracheal resection. CONCLUSIONS The 2 cases presented in this report have shown that even when patients recover from severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation, tracheal stenosis should be recognized as a potential complication and careful follow-up is required.","Gervasio, Carmine Fernando; Averono, Gianluca; Robiolio, Luca; Bertoletti, Massimo; Colageo, Umberto; De Col, Luca; Bertone, Fabio",Am J Case Rep,,271

Since the outbreak of infection by SARS-CoV-2 began, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease has rapidly spread worldwide. Thus, a search for effective drugs able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 has become a global pursuit. The 3C-like protease (3CLpro), which hydrolyses viral polyproteins to produce functional proteins, is essential for coronavirus replication and is considered an important therapeutic target for diseases caused by coronaviruses, including COVID-19. Many 3CLpro inhibitors have been proposed and some new drug candidates have achieved success in preclinical studies. In this review, we briefly describe recent developments in determining the structure of 3CLpro and its function in coronavirus replication and summarise new insights into 3CLpro inhibitors and their mechanisms of action. The clinical application prospects and limitations of 3CLpro inhibitors for COVID-19 treatment are also discussed.","He, Jun; Hu, Lijun; Huang, Xiaojun; Wang, Chenran; Zhang, Zhimin; Wang, Ying; Zhang, Dongmei; Ye, Wencai",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,271

However, to date, a paucity of robust, reliable immune-related biomarkers has been identified that are capable of estimating prognosis in HNSCC patients. METHODS: High-throughput RNA sequencing was performed in tumors and matched adjacent tissues from five HNSCC patients, and the immune signatures expression of 730 immune-related transcripts selected from the nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel were assessed. Survival analyzes were performed in a training cohort, consisting of 416 HNSCC cases, retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. A prognostic signature was built, using elastic net-penalized Cox regression and backward, stepwise Cox regression analyzes. The outcomes were validated by an independent cohort of 115 HNSCC patients, using tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry staining. Cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT) was also used to estimate the relative fractions of 22 immune-cell types and their correlations coefficients with prognostic biomarkers. RESULTS: Collectively, 248 immune-related genes were differentially expressed in paired tumors and normal tissues using RNA sequencing. After process screening in the training TCGA cohort, four immune-related genes (PVR, TNFRSF12A, IL21R, and SOCS1) were significantly associated with overall survival (OS). Integrating these genes with Path_N stage, a multiplex model was built and suggested better performance in determining 5 years OS (receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, area under the curve (AUC)=0.709) than others. Further protein-based validation was conducted in 115 HNSCC patients. Similarly, high expression of PVR and TNFRSF12A were associated with poor OS (Kaplan-Meier p=0.017 and 0.0032), while high expression of IL21R and SOCS1 indicated favorable OS (Kaplan-Meier p<0.0001 and =0.0018). The integrated model with Path_N stage still demonstrated efficacy in OS evaluation (Kaplan-Meier p<0.0001, ROC AUC=0.893). Besides, the four prognostic genes were significantly correlated with activated CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, follicular helper T cells and regulatory T cells, implying the possible involvement of these genes in the immunoregulation and development of HNSCC. CONCLUSIONS: The well-established model encompassing both immune-related biomarkers and clinicopathological factor might serve as a promising tool for the prognostic prediction of HNSCC.","Yao, Yao; Yan, Zhongyi; Lian, Senlin; Wei, Liangnian; Zhou, Chao; Feng, Dongju; Zhang, Yuan; Yang, Jianrong; Li, Ming; Chen, Yun",J. immunotherap. cancer,,271

Reflections, Perspectives, Opportunities",2020,"Reduced hippocampal volume is a consistent finding in neuroimaging studies of individuals with schizophrenia. While these studies have the advantage of large-sample sizes, they are unable to quantify the cellular basis of structural or functional changes. In contrast, postmortem studies are well suited to explore subfield and cellular alterations, but low sample sizes and subject heterogeneity impede establishment of statistically significant differences. Here we use a meta-analytic approach to synthesize the extant literature of hippocampal subfield volume and cellular composition in schizophrenia patients and healthy control subjects. Following pre-registration (PROSPERO CRD42019138280), PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO were searched using the term: (schizophrenia OR schizoaffective) AND (post-mortem OR postmortem) AND hippocampus. Subjects were adult men and women with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder or non-psychiatric control subjects, and key outcomes, stratified by hippocampal hemisphere and subfield, were volume, neuron number, neuron density, and neuron size. A random effects meta-analysis was performed. Thirty-two studies were included (413 patients, 415 controls). In patients, volume and neuron number were significantly reduced in multiple hippocampal subfields in left, but not right hippocampus, whereas neuron density was not significantly different in any hippocampal subfield. Neuron size, averaged bilaterally, was also significantly reduced in all calculated subfields. Heterogeneity was minimal to moderate, with rare evidence of publication bias. Meta-regression of age and illness duration did not explain heterogeneity of total hippocampal volume effect sizes. These results extend neuroimaging findings of smaller hippocampal volume in schizophrenia patients and further our understanding of regional and cellular neuropathology in schizophrenia.","Roeske, Maxwell J; Konradi, Christine; Heckers, Stephan; Lewis, Alan S",Mol. psychiatry,,271

261366,Remdesivir: An antiviral still seeking a raison d'être,2021,"The emergence of rapidly expanding infectious diseases such as coronavirus (COVID-19) demands effective biosensors that can promptly detect and recognize the pathogens. Field-effect transistors based on semiconducting two-dimensional (2D) materials (2D-FETs) have been identified as potential candidates for rapid and label-free sensing applications. This is because any perturbation of such atomically thin 2D channels can significantly impact their electronic transport properties. Here, we report the use of FET based on semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) WSe2 as a promising biosensor for the rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The sensor is created by functionalizing the WSe2 monolayers with a monoclonal antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and exhibits a detection limit of down to 25 fg/µL in 0.01X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Comprehensive theoretical and experimental studies, including density functional theory, atomic force microscopy, Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies, and electronic transport properties, were performed to characterize and explain the device performance. The results demonstrate that TMDC-based 2D-FETs can potentially serve as sensitive and selective biosensors for the rapid detection of infectious diseases.","Fathi-Hafshejani, Parvin; Azam, Nurul; Wang, Lu; Kuroda, Marcelo A; Hamilton, Michael C; Hasim, Sahar; Mahjouri-Samani, Masoud",ACS nano,,271

These assays need to target conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2 global variants and avoid cross-reactivity to seasonal human coronaviruses. To contribute to this effort, we employed an in silico immunoinformatics analysis pipeline to identify immunogenic peptides resulting from conserved and highly networked regions with topological importance from the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike proteins. A total of 57 highly networked T-cell epitopes that are conserved across geographic viral variants were identified from these viral proteins, with a binding potential to diverse HLA alleles and 80 to 100% global population coverage. Importantly, 18 of these T-cell epitope derived peptides had limited homology to seasonal human coronaviruses making them promising candidates for SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell immunity assays. Moreover, two of the NC-derived peptides elicited effector/polyfunctional responses of CD8+ T cells derived from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients.IMPORTANCE The development of specific and validated immunologic tools is critical for understanding the level and duration of the cellular response induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccines against this novel coronavirus disease. To contribute to this effort, we employed an immunoinformatics analysis pipeline to define 57 SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic peptides within topologically important regions of the nucleocapsid (NC) and spike (S) proteins that will be effective for detecting cellular immune responses in 80 to 100% of the global population. Our immunoinformatics analysis revealed that 18 of these peptides had limited homology to circulating seasonal human coronaviruses and therefore are promising candidates for distinguishing SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses from pre-existing coronavirus immunity. Importantly, CD8+ T cells derived from SARS-CoV-2 survivors exhibited polyfunctional effector responses to two novel NC-derived peptides identified as HLA-binders. These studies provide a proof of concept that our immunoinformatics analysis pipeline identifies novel immunogens which can elicit polyfunctional SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses.","Lee, Eunok; Sandgren, Kerrie; Duette, Gabriel; Stylianou, Vicki V; Khanna, Rajiv; Eden, John-Sebastian; Blyth, Emily; Gottlieb, David; Cunningham, Anthony L; Palmer, Sarah",J. virol,,271

This review provides a comprehensive, up-to-date assessment on current issues of the basic virology, pathogenesis, clinical epidemiology, and laboratory features, treatment and prevention strategies for ncovid-19. However, current evidences on ncovid-19 demonstrate that these viruses effectively spread via infected droplets, aerosols, contacts, hands and surfaces. It is transmitted between individuals. Previously, two coronaviruses infecting animals have evolved and caused outbreaks in humans i.e. SARS-cov (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS-cov (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). Coronavirus is responsible for a substantial proportion of upper respiratory tract infections. These viruses traditionally associated with dry cough, cold, shortness of breath, sore throat and fever. So, optimal treatment involves prompt diagnosis and it is slightly manageable with current technologies. Indeed, whether the clinical manifestations of coronavirus are related directly to viral pathogenicity or secondary to the host immune response is the subject of ongoing research.

284749,"Venous thrombosis epidemiology, pathophysiology, and anticoagulant therapies and trials in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection",2020,"OBJECTIVE: Social distancing has been one of the primary interventions used to slow the spread of COVID-19 during the ongoing pandemic. Although statewide stay-at-home orders in the United States received a large degree of media and political attention, relatively little peer-reviewed research has examined the impacts of such orders on social distancing behaviors. METHOD: This study used daily GPS-derived movement from 2858 counties in the United States from March 1 to May 7, 2020, to test the degree to which changes in state-level stay-at-home orders were associated with movement outside the home. RESULTS: From early March to early April, people in counties with state-level stay-at-home orders decreased their movement significantly more than counties without state-level stay-at-home orders; 3.1% more people stayed within 1 mile of home, and 1.6% fewer vehicle miles were driven per day. From early April to early May, people in counties within states that ended their stay-at-home orders increased their movement significantly more than counties in states whose stay-at-home orders remained in place; 1.2% fewer people remained within 1 mile of home, and 6.2% more vehicle miles were driven per day. The magnitude of changes associated with state-level stay-at-home orders was many times smaller than the total changes in movement across all counties over the same periods. CONCLUSIONS: Stay-at-home orders were associated with greater social distancing but accounted for only part of this behavioral change. Research on behavior change would be useful to determine additional interventions that could support social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bourassa, Kyle J",Psychosom Med,,271

299218,Inhaled corticosteroids and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 in COPD,2021,"Remdesivir is the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The active form of remdesivir acts as a nucleoside analog and inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir is incorporated by the RdRp into the growing RNA product and allows for addition of three more nucleotides before RNA synthesis stalls. Here we use synthetic RNA chemistry, biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy to establish the molecular mechanism of remdesivir-induced RdRp stalling. We show that addition of the fourth nucleotide following remdesivir incorporation into the RNA product is impaired by a barrier to further RNA translocation. This translocation barrier causes retention of the RNA 3'-nucleotide in the substrate-binding site of the RdRp and interferes with entry of the next nucleoside triphosphate, thereby stalling RdRp. In the structure of the remdesivir-stalled state, the 3'-nucleotide of the RNA product is matched and located with the template base in the active center, and this may impair proofreading by the viral 3'-exonuclease. These mechanistic insights should facilitate the quest for improved antivirals that target coronavirus replication.","Kokic, Goran; Hillen, Hauke S; Tegunov, Dimitry; Dienemann, Christian; Seitz, Florian; Schmitzova, Jana; Farnung, Lucas; Siewert, Aaron; Höbartner, Claudia; Cramer, Patrick",Nat Commun,,271

LUS plays an important role in a wide range of pathologies, including cardiogenic oedema, acute respiratory distress syndrome and fibrosis. Specific LUS findings have proved useful and predictive of acute respiratory distress syndrome which is of particular relevance in the suspicion and monitoring of patients with lung disease. Furthermore, several studies have confirmed the role of LUS in the screening of interstitial lung diseases in connective tissue diseases. Given these data, LUS will likely play an important role in the management of COVID-19 patients from identification of specific abnormalities corresponding to definite pneumonia phases and CT scans findings.

Monitoring signs and symptoms with checklists or aids called decision support tools may help nursing home staff to detect infection in residents, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic.We plan to conduct a survey exploring views and experiences of how infections are detected and managed in practice by nurses, care workers and managers in nursing homes in England and Sweden. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An international cross-sectional descriptive survey, using a pretested questionnaire, will be used to explore nurses, care workers and managers views and experiences of how infections are detected and managed in practice in nursing homes. Data will be analysed descriptively and univariate associations between personal and organisational factors explored. This will help identify important factors related to awareness, knowledge, attitudes, belief and skills likely to affect future implementation of a decision support tool for the early detection of infection in nursing home residents. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved using the self-certification process at the University of Surrey and Linköping University ethics committee (Approval 2018/514-32) in 2018. Study findings will be disseminated through community/stakeholder/service user engagement events in each country, publication in academic peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations. A LAY summary will be provided to participants who indicate they would like to receive this information.This is the first stage of a plan of work to revise and evaluate the Early Detection of Infection Scale (EDIS) tool and its effect on managing infections and reducing unplanned hospital admissions in nursing home residents. Implementation of the EDIS tool may have important implications for the healthcare economy; this will be explored in cost-benefit analyses as the work progresses.","Carey, N; Alkhamees, Nouf; Cox, Anna; Sund-Levander, Marta; Tingström, Pia; Mold, Freda",BMJ Open,,271

The pneumococcal vaccine coverage presents extremely low among elderly people in China. However, the serious event of COVID-19 drives interest in the pneumococcal vaccine, prompting us investigating the willingness to accept the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) and influencing factors among people aged over 60 years during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was employed using a self-administered questionnaire in Shenzhen City of China, elaborating the willingness toward PPSV23 in the elderly persons. Binomial logistic analyses were performed to estimate the influencing factors using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Among 15,066 respondents, 91.5% presented a positive attitude toward PPSV23. Logistic analyses suggested the influencing factors included knowledge about pneumonia (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.391, 95%CI 1.214-1.593), perception of the seriousness of pneumonia (aOR 1.437, 95%CI 1.230-1.680) and preventing way for pneumonia (aOR 1.639, 95%CI 1.440-1.865), worried about getting pneumonia (aOR 2.751, 95%CI 2.444-3.096), understanding vaccine policy (aOR 1.774, 95%CI 1.514-2.079), and influenza vaccine (aOR 3.516 and 95%CI 2.261-5.468) and PPSV23 histories (aOR 3.199, 95%CI 1.492-6.860).

METHODS: We enrolled 4485 patients discharged from six subspecialty medical services. We implemented late-afternoon CAPP rounds to identify patients who could have morning discharge the subsequent day. After an initial successful implementation of the intervention, we identified lack of sustainability. We made changes with sustained implementation of the intervention. This is a before-after study of a quality improvement intervention. PROGRAM EVALUATION: Primary measures of intervention effectiveness were percentage of patients who received EDO by 11 am and patients discharged by noon. Additional measure of effectiveness were percent of patients admitted to the correct ward, emergency department (ED)-to-ward transfer time compared between intervention and nonintervention periods. We compared the overall expected LOS and the average weekly discharges to assess for comparability across the control and intervention time periods. We used the readmission rate as balancing measure to ensure that the intervention was not have unintended negative patients consequences. RESULTS: Expected length of stay based upon discharge diagnosis/comorbidities and readmission rates were similar across the intervention and control time periods. The average weekly discharges were not statistically significant. Percentage of EDO by 11 am was higher in the first intervention period, second intervention period and combined intervention periods (28.9% vs. 21.8%, P < 0.001) compared with the respective control periods. Percent discharged before noon increased in the first intervention period, second intervention period and for the combined intervention periods (17 vs. 11.8%, P < 0.001). There was no difference in the percent admitted to the correct ward and ED-to-ward transfer time. CONCLUSION: Afternoon CAPP rounds to identify early patient discharges the following day led to increase in EDO entered by 11 am and discharges by noon without an adverse change in readmission rates and LOS.","Kher, Sucharita; Haas, Mark; Schelling, Kimberly; Wright, Seth; Allison, Harmony; Poutsiaka, Debra D; Roberts, Kari E; Chang, Hong; Salem, Deeb N; Kopelman, Richard; Freund, Karen M",Hosp Pract (1995),,271

We start with the problem of the older people affected by dementia and Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia for which also the execution of a simple diagnostic test (such as nasopharyngeal swab) could be problematic. Another important problem is the management of wandering patients for which the re-organization of the spaces and vaccination could be the solutions. The relationship with families is another important problem, also from a medico-legal point of view, that can be faced using video conferencing tools. Moreover, we discussed the importance of stratifying prognosis in older nursing home residents for the best management and therapeutically approach, including palliative care, also using telemedicine and the inclusion of prognostic tools in daily clinical practice.

357746,Clinical course of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 soon after thoracoscopic lung surgery,2020,"In patients who are successfully resuscitated after initial cardiac arrest (CA), mortality and morbidity rates are high, due to ischemia/reperfusion injury to the whole body including the nervous and immune systems. How the interactions between these two critical systems contribute to post-CA outcome remains largely unknown. Using a mouse model of CA and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR), we demonstrate that CA/CPR induced neuroinflammation in the brain, in particular, a marked increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, which subsequently activated the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Importantly, this activation was associated with a severe immunosuppression phenotype after CA. The phenotype was characterized by a striking reduction in size of lymphoid organs accompanied by a massive loss of immune cells and reduced immune function of splenic lymphocytes. The mechanistic link between post-CA immunosuppression and the HPA axis was substantiated, as we discovered that glucocorticoid treatment, which mimics effects of the activated HPA axis, exacerbated post-CA immunosuppression, while RU486 treatment, which suppresses its effects, significantly mitigated lymphopenia and lymphoid organ atrophy and improved CA outcome. Taken together, targeting the HPA axis could be a viable immunomodulatory therapeutic to preserve immune homeostasis after CA/CPR and thus improve prognosis of post-resuscitation CA patients.","Zhao, Qiang; Shen, Yuntian; Li, Ran; Wu, Jiangbo; Lyu, Jingjun; Jiang, Maorong; Lu, Liping; Zhu, Minghua; Wang, Wei; Wang, Zhuoran; Liu, Qiang; Hoffmann, Ulrike; Karhausen, Jörn; Sheng, Huaxin; Zhang, Weiguo; Yang, Wei",J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,,271

The lessons from the Ebola outbreak exemplify the harmful impacts that can result from an epidemic in the absence of focused responses from governments to protect the gains made in sexual and reproductive health (e.g., contraceptive use, method availability) in LMICs over the past several decades. In this comment, we present an analysis illustrating what is at stake if government actions and provision of resources during the COVID-19 pandemic do not ensure that essential sexual and reproductive health services continue. These findings can provide guidance to policymakers and donors, and highlight the importance of recognizing sexual and reproductive health needs during the pandemic response and recovery periods.","Riley, T.; Sully, E.; Ahmed, Z.; Biddlecom, A.",International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health,,271

365579,Detectable severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human breast milk of a mildly symptomatic patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 related lockdowns and distancing measures have presented families with unprecedented challenges. A UK-wide cohort study tracking changes in families' mental health since early lockdown (Co-SPACE) found a significant rise in primary school-aged children's behaviour problems and associated family-related stress. Three-quarters of parents in Co-SPACE also reported wanting extra support. In SPARKLE, we will examine whether providing Co-SPACE families with a smartphone application delivering information and parenting support, Parent Positive, can reverse the negative effects of the pandemic on children and parents. The efficacy on child and parent outcomes and cost-effectiveness of Parent Positive will be examined. We will also test whether the effects are moderated by pre-existing levels of child conduct problems and usage of Parent Positive. Exploratory analyses will examine whether other baseline characteristics or lockdown circumstances moderate the effects of Parent Positive. TRIAL DESIGN: SPARKLE is a two-arm superiority parallel group randomised controlled trial embedded in an existing large UK-wide self-selected community cohort - Co-SPACE. Those who consent to SPARKLE will be randomised 1:1 to either Parent Positive or Follow-up As Usual (FAU). PARTICIPANTS: Co-SPACE (a UK-wide longitudinal cohort study) parents aged &#8805;18 who have children aged 4-10 years will be eligible for SPARKLE. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Parent Positive: is a digital public health intervention that can be delivered rapidly at scale to support parents in managing their children's behaviour to reduce conduct problems and levels of family conflict, which were exacerbated during the first lockdown, and which may increase further in future months as families need to cope with continuous uncertainty and further disruption to their daily lives. Co-designed with parents and based on decades of parenting research, Parent Positive consists of three elements: (i) Parenting Boosters: where advice, delivered in the form of narrated animations, videos, graphics and text is provided to help parents with eight common parenting challenges; (ii) Parenting Exchange: a facilitated parent-to-parent communication and peer support platform and; (iii) Parent Resources: giving access to carefully selected high-quality, evidence-based online parenting resources. Follow-up as Usual: FAU was selected as a comparator because the public health nature meant that an active comparator was not appropriate due to the pragmatic, rapid implementation of the trial. Individuals randomised to FAU will receive no intervention for the first two months while the data for baseline (T1), T2 and T3 are collected. They will then be given full access to the app until 30th November 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES: Outcome measures will be collected remotely through Qualtrics according to the Co-SPACE schedule at baseline (T1), which will be the Co-SPACE survey data obtained immediately prior to randomisation, and then at one month (T2) and two months (T3) post-randomisation. Measures will be collected to assess group differences in child and parent outcomes, costs and service utilisation, and adverse events. Usage of Parent Positive will also be tracked. The primary outcome is parent-reported child conduct problems at one-month post-randomisation measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire conduct problems subscale. RANDOMISATION: Enrolled participants will be allocated to Parent Positive or FAU at the ratio of 1:1 by simple randomisation using the Randomizer function within the Qualtrics programme. Neither blocking nor stratification will be used. BLINDING (MASKING): It is not possible to blind parents enrolled in the study and Qualtrics will automatically inform parents of their group allocation. Blinded members of the research team and the senior statistician will not be given access to the Qualtrics system or the data in order to remain blinded until after the analysis is complete. We do not anticipate any serious harms associated with taking part in the intervention, therefore there will be no need to unblind any blinded staff during the study. The junior statistician will be unblinded throughout.

373445,Does Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Cause Sepsis?,2020,"Amid growing debate between scientists and policymakers on the trade-off between public safety and reviving economy during the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Bangladesh decided to relax the countrywide lockdown restrictions from the beginning of June 2020. Instead, the Ministry of Public Affairs officials have declared some parts of the capital city and a few other districts as red zones or high-risk areas based on the number of people infected in the late June 2020. Nonetheless, the COVID-19 infection rate had been increasing in almost every other part of the country. Ironically, rather than ensuring rapid tests and isolation of COVID-19 patients, from the beginning of July 2020, the Directorate General of Health Services restrained the maximum number of tests per laboratory. Thus, the health experts have raised the question of whether the government is heading toward achieving herd immunity instead of containing the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, the dynamics of the pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh is analyzed with integrated the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) in the SIRD model. We demonstrate that the herd immunity threshold can be reduced to 31% than that of 60% by considering age group cluster analysis resulting in a total of 53.0 million susceptible populations. With the data of COVID-19 cases till January, 2021, the time-varying reproduction numbers are used to explain the nature of the pandemic. Based on the estimations of active, severe and critical cases, we discuss a set of policy recommendations to improve the current pandemic control methods in Bangladesh.

378893,Characterization of handheld disinfectant sprayers for effective surface decontamination to mitigate severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission,2021,"BACKGROUND: In pandemics such as COVID-19, shortages of personal protective equipment are common. One solution may be to decontaminate equipment such as facemasks for reuse. AIM: To collect and synthesize existing information on decontamination of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) using microwave and heat-based treatments, with special attention to impacts on mask function (aerosol penetration, airflow resistance), fit, and physical traits. METHODS: A systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42020177036) of literature available from Medline, Embase, Global Health, and other sources was conducted. Records were screened independently by two reviewers, and data was extracted from studies that reported on effects of microwave- or heat-based decontamination on N95 FFR performance, fit, physical traits, and/or reductions in microbial load. FINDINGS: Thirteen studies were included that used dry/moist microwave irradiation, heat, or autoclaving. All treatment types reduced pathogen load by a log10 reduction factor of at least three when applied for sufficient duration (>30 s microwave, >60 min dry heat), with most studies assessing viral pathogens. Mask function (aerosol penetration <5% and airflow resistance <25 mmH2O) was preserved after all treatments except autoclaving. Fit was maintained for most N95 models, though all treatment types caused observable physical damage to at least one model. CONCLUSIONS: Microwave irradiation and heat may be safe and effective viral decontamination options for N95 FFR reuse during critical shortages. The evidence does not support autoclaving or high-heat (>90°C) approaches. Physical degradation may be an issue for certain mask models, and more real-world evidence on fit is needed.","Gertsman, S; Agarwal, A; O039,; Hearn, K; Webster, R; Tsampalieros, A; Barrowman, N; Sampson, M; Sikora, L; Staykov, E; Ng, R; Gibson, J; Dinh, T; Agyei, K; Chamberlain, G; McNally, J D",J Hosp Infect,,271

However, the molecular effects and associated potential impacts of Cd-accumulated kidney have not been well investigated. In this study, mouse was used as a model to investigate the Cd-induced proteomic profile change in kidney, and a total of 34 differentially expressed proteins were detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and further identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Through Gene Ontology analysis and KEGG pathway annotation, it showed that Cd-regulated kidney metabolism and promoted renal damage and cell migration. By validation of Western blotting and RT-qPCR, metastasis-related proteins LIM and SH3 domain protein 1 (LASP1) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase/cytosolic [GTP] (PEPCK1) were confirmed to be upregulated; Acyl-CoA synthetase medium-chain family member 3 (ACSM3) was downregulated. Furthermore, carcinoma development-related proteins initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) and pyridoxine-5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) were upregulated, and pyridoxal kinase (PK) was downregulated. The downregulation of Na(+)/H(+) exchange regulatory cofactor (NHERF3) might promote renal damage which associated with decrease of transferrin (TRF) in kidney. Taken together, our results revealed proteomic profile of Cd-induced nephrotoxicity and provided data for further insights into the mechanisms of Cd toxicity.","Sun, Xi; Wang, Yanwei; Jiang, Tingya; Yuan, Xiao; Ren, Zhen; Tuffour, Alex; Liu, Haitao; Zhou, Yang; Gu, Jie; Shi, Haifeng",Biol. trace elem. res,,271

394588,Clinical Utility of Buccal Swabs for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Detection in Coronavirus Disease 2019-Infected Children,2020,"Background: Managing high levels of severe COVID-19 in the acute setting can impact upon the quality of care provided to both affected patients and those requiring other hospital services. Mass vaccination has offered a route to reduce societal restrictions while protecting hospitals from being overwhelmed. Yet, early in the mass vaccination effort, the possible effect on future bed pressures remained subject to considerable uncertainty. This paper provides an account of how, in one healthcare system, operational decision-making and bed planning was supported through modelling the effect of a range of vaccination scenarios on future COVID-19 admissions. Methods: An epidemiological model of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) type was fitted to local data for the one-million resident healthcare system located in South West England. Model parameters and vaccination scenarios were calibrated through a system-wide multi-disciplinary working group, comprising public health intelligence specialists, healthcare planners, epidemiologists, and academics. From 4 March 2021 (the time of the study), scenarios assumed incremental relaxations to societal restrictions according to the envisaged UK Government timeline, with all restrictions to be removed by 21 June 2021. Results: Achieving 95% vaccine uptake in adults by 31 July 2021 would not avert a third wave in autumn 2021 but would produce a median peak bed requirement approximately 6% (IQR: 1% to 24%) of that experienced during the second wave (January 2021). A two-month delay in vaccine rollout would lead to significantly higher peak bed occupancy, at 66% (11% to 146%) of that of the second wave. If only 75% uptake was achieved (the amount typically associated with vaccination campaigns) then the second wave peak for acute and intensive care beds would be exceeded by 4% and 19% respectively, an amount which would seriously pressure hospital capacity. Conclusion: Modelling provided support to senior managers in setting the number of acute and intensive care beds to make available for COVID-19 patients, as well as highlighting the importance of public health in promoting high vaccine uptake among the population. Forecast accuracy has since been supported by actual data collected following the analysis, with observed peak bed occupancy falling comfortably within the inter-quartile range of modelled projections.","Booton, Ross D; Powell, Anna L; Turner, Katy ME; Wood, Richard M",,,271

Methods: The study population included a random list of 3000 individuals with T2D derived from 30,748 individuals who had visited a large tertiary diabetes center during the past year. The survey was carried out through a telephonic interview. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information on changes in lifestyle, access and challenges to diabetes care and use of technologies such as telemedicine facilities and use of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), etc. Results: Of the 2510 individuals successfully interviewed (83.7% response rate), 382 (15.2%) reported having attempted to consult their health care providers during the lockdown, of whom only 30.6% utilized the telemedicine facility. However, 96 (82%) of those who utilized the telemedicine facility (n = 117) were happy with their experience and 68 (58.1%) were willing to continue to use the facility in the future. Only 11.4% of participants utilized online support for management of diabetes. Use of SMBG increased significantly from 15.5% to 51.3% during the lockdown. There was an improvement in glycemic control during the lockdown (HbA1c:before vs. during lockdown: 8.2% ± 1.9% vs. 7.7% ± 1.7%, P < 0.001) in a nonrandomly selected subset of subjects (n = 205). Conclusions: Acceptance of telemedicine facilities remains suboptimal in this Asian Indian population, in spite of high levels of satisfaction among those who utilized it. The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown have not adversely affected metabolic control in our patients, and indeed there appears to be an improvement in HbA1c levels. Greater accessibility and acceptance of technology could help individuals with diabetes to maintain better contact with their physicians and ensure better metabolic control in the future.","Anjana, Ranjit Mohan; Pradeepa, Rajendra; Deepa, Mohan; Jebarani, Saravanan; Venkatesan, Ulagamathesan; Parvathi, Somasundaram Jaya; Balasubramanyam, Muthuswamy; Radha, Venkatesan; Poongothai, Subramani; Sudha, Vasudevan; Rani, Coimbatore Subramanian Shanthi; Ranjani, Harish; Amutha, Anandakumar; Manickam, Nagaraj; Unnikrishnan, Ranjit; Mohan, Viswanathan",,,271

This paper sets out principles of care, including the vital role of skilled birth attendants and birth companions, and the importance of obstetricians and midwives working together effectively and speaking with one voice, whether to women or to policy makers. The optimization of high-quality, safe, and personalized care in the second stage of labor for all women globally can only be achieved by appropriate attention to the training of birth attendants, midwives, and obstetricians. FIGO is committed to this aim alongside the WHO, ICM, and all FIGO's 132 member societies.","Wright, Alison; Nassar, Anwar H; Visser, Gerry; Ramasauskaite, Diana; Theron, Gerhard",Int J Gynaecol Obstet,,271
401404,Mortality Rates of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Caused by the Novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2),2021,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to provide objective and real-life data concerning the impact of the COVID-19 pandemicon ophthalmology residency training in Portugal. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Descriptive survey-based study applied to current Portuguese ophthalmology residents (n = 80 eligible). RESULTS: Seventy-five residents participated (94% response rate). All except one (99%) admitted a change in their routine clinical practice during the pandemic, and most (89%) continued to be engaged in ophthalmology department duties. Twenty-five percent were deployed to COVID-19 units, which was combined with ophthalmological activities in about half of them (47%). A significant proportion of participants stated that they were enrolled in the following ophthalmological activities: emergency/inpatient care (87%), outpatient visits (73%; general 70% vs subspecialty 29%), and surgical procedures (64%). Twenty-five percent did not assist in any outpatient visits and 36% did not participate in any surgical procedures. On a scale from 1 (no impact) to 5 (maximum impact), most participants classified their perceived negative impact of the pandemic on the training program as 3 (24%), 4 (40%), or 5 (27%). Participants highly agreed with the extension of the residency program (80%) in order to to make up for training disruption. DISCUSSION: Most trainees provided ophthalmological care during the pandemic. However, those clinical activities were essentially related to general and emergency care. Surgical experience was significantly curtailed. As such, strategies are needed to guarantee a high-quality learning process. Further studies are required to develop an international perspective on how ophthalmology training programs have been affected so that educational organizations can make recommendations regarding standardized adjustments to training programs. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the training of ophthalmology residents nationwide.","Silva, Nisa; Laiginhas, Rita; Meireles, Angelina; Barbosa Breda, João",Acta Med Port,,271
401405,Mortality Rates of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Caused by the Novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2),2021,"Objective: By describing and analyzing the epidemic characteristics and trends of the attack rate, the crude mortality and relevant indexes in Hubei province during the pandemic of COVID-19 to provide comprehensive evaluations of the epidemic trends and the effects of intervention measures. Methods: Based on the case data reported in Hubei province during the COVID-19 epidemic, combined with the important time of major interventions and event, the cumulative attack rate, the sequential increase rate of new cases, baseline increase rate of new cases, the observation- confirmed case conversion rate, the cumulative crude mortality, the daily severe case rate, and the ratio of death to severe were used to describe and analyze the epidemic characteristics in different phases of the COVID-19 epidemic. Results: The epidemic experienced an outbreak phase from January 10 to February 3 with large amount of case reported, a peak phase from February 4 to February 19 with continuous increasing number of new cases and deaths, a platform phase from February 20 to March 3 with balanced diagnosis and treatment number, and a descending phase from March 4 to March 18 with decreased diagnosis and increased treatment number. Up to March 18, the cumulative attack rate of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei province increased from 0.03/10 000 on January 19 to 11.46/10 000, from 0.04/10 000 on January 10 to 45.13/10 000 in Wuhan city, and from 0.002/ 10 000 on January 20 to 3.70/ 10 000 in other areas of Hubei province other than Wuhan city. The increase rate of new cases fluctuated during the epidemic period and reached the highest at February 12 in Hubei province. The cumulative crude mortality in Hubei Province increased rapidly from 1.01% on January 19 to 5.13% on January 26, then decreased to 2.54% on February 13, and then slowly increased to 4.62% on March 18, and similar trend was also observed in Wuhan city. The daily severe rate in Hubei Province increased from 26.88% on January 27 to 34.27% on March 18. The ratio of death to severe decreased from 7.37% on January 23 to 0.35% on March 18. Conclusions: The epidemic cycle of COVID-19 in Hubei province proposed to be 60 days, which was about 1.76 times of the combination of the longest incubation period or isolation period (14 d) and the average hospitalization time of confirmed patients in Hubei province (20 d). It suggested that the major anti-epidemic decisions made in China were effective.","Song, Y; Liu, M; Jia, W P; Wang, S S; Cao, W Z; Han, K; Yang, S S; Li, J; Chen, Z; He, Y",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,271

PATIENTS AND METHODS: An electronic survey on breast reconstruction practice demographics, COVID-19-related restrictions on breast reconstruction, and pertinent dates of restrictions was employed. RESULTS: A total of 228 responses were obtained. Demographics were balanced for geography with most respondents located in either urban or suburban settings (91.2%). The majority proceeded with mastectomy/reconstruction as originally planned (39.0%), followed by hormonal/chemotherapy only (22.6%). The most common reconstructive option was tissue expander/implant-based reconstruction (47.7%). Most institutions implemented restrictions between March 11-20th (59%). Almost all respondents (91.8%) reported mandatory pre-operative SARS-Cov-2 testing once cases resumed. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has forced the breast surgical team to adapt to new conditions to the detriment of women with breast cancer requiring reconstruction. Varying restrictions have limited access to breast reconstruction, carrying consequences yet to be determined.","Joseph, Walter J; Bustos, Samyd S; Losee, Joseph E; Rubin, J Peter; DE LA Cruz, Carolyn",Anticancer Res,,271

435675,Concerning Trials Registration,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has hit both the Spanish economy and the population's health hard. The result is an unprecedented economic and social crisis due to uncertainty about the remedy and the socioeconomic effects on people's lives. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 using key indicators of the Spanish economy for the 17 Autonomous Communities (ACs) of the country. National statistics were examined in the search for impacts or anomalies occurring since the beginning of the pandemic. To estimate the strength of the impact on each of the indicators analyzed, we used Bayesian structural time series. We also calculated the correlation between the rate of GDP decline during 2020 and the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the ACs. RESULTS: In 2020, the cumulative impact on the gross domestic product was of -11.41% (95% credible interval: -13.46;-9.29). The indicator for business turnover changed by -9.37% (-12.71;-6.07). The Spanish employment market was strongly affected;our estimates showed a cumulative increase of 11.9% (4.27;19.45) in the rate of unemployment during 2020. The worst indicators were recorded in the ACs most economically dependent on the services sector. There was no statistical association between the incidence of COVID-19 in 2020 and the fall in GDP in the ACs. CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates portray a dramatic situation in Spain, where the COVID-19 crisis has had more serious economic and health consequences than in other European countries. The productive system in Spain is too dependent on sectors vulnerable to the pandemic, and it is necessary to design and implement profound changes through the European Next Generation program.","Pinilla, J.; Barber, P.; Vallejo-Torres, L.; Rodriguez-Mireles, S.; Lopez-Valcarcel, B.

441725,A Rationale for Use of High Flow Nasal Cannula for Select Patients With Suspected or Confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Infection,2020,"OBJECTIVES: There is limited information on the performance of rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests to identify SARS-CoV-2-infected asymptomatic individuals. In this field study, we evaluated the Panbio&#8482; COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (Abbott Diagnostics, Jena, Germany) for this purpose. METHODS: A total of 634 individuals (355 female; median age, 37 years; range, 9-87) were enrolled. Two nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from household (n = 338) and non-household contacts (n = 296) of COVID-19 cases. RAD testing was carried out at the point of care. The RT-PCR test used was the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). RESULTS: Household contacts were tested at a median of 2 days (range, 1-7) after diagnosis of the index case, whereas non-household contacts (n = 296) were tested at a median of 6 days (range, 1-7) after exposure. In total, 79 individuals (12.4%) tested positive by RT-PCR, of whom 38 (48.1%) yielded positive RAD results. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the RAD test was 48.1% (95% CI 37.4-58.9) and 100% (95% CI 99.3-100), respectively. Sensitivity was higher in household (50.8%; 95% CI 38.9-62.5) than in non-household (35.7%; 95% CI 16.3-61.2%) contacts. Individuals testing positive by RAD test were more likely (p < 0.001) to become symptomatic than their negative counterparts. DISCUSSION: The Panbio test displays low sensitivity in asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19 patients, particularly in non-household contacts. Nonetheless, establishing the optimal timing for upper respiratory tract collection in this group seems imperative to pinpoint test sensitivity.","Torres, Ignacio; Poujois, Sandrine; Albert, Eliseo; Colomina, Javier; Navarro, David",Clin. microbiol. infect,,271

However, to our knowledge, the consequences of mask wearing on communication between surgeons and patients have not been studied. Objective: To evaluate the effects of clear vs standard covered masks on communication during surgical clinic encounters. Design: This randomized clinical trial examined communication between surgeons and their patients when surgeons wore clear vs covered masks in surgical outpatient clinics at a single academic medical center. New patients were recruited from participating surgeons' clinic schedules. Interventions: Surgeons wore either clear masks or covered masks for each clinic visit with a new patient, based on a per-visit randomization plan. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measures included patient perceptions of (1) surgeon communication and (2) trust in surgeons, as well as (3) quantitative assessments and (4) qualitative assessments regarding patient impressions of the surgeon's mask. After the clinic encounter, patients completed a verbal survey including validated Clinician and Group Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems questions. Additional questions involved surgeon empathy, trust, and the patient's impression of the surgeon's mask. Data were analyzed by comparing patient data in the clear vs covered groups using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests, and comments were analyzed for themes. Results: Two hundred patients were enrolled from 15 surgeons' clinics spanning 7 subspecialties. When surgeons wore a clear mask, patients rated their surgeons higher for providing understandable explanations (clear, 95 of 100 [95%] vs covered, 78 of 100 [78%]; P < .001), demonstrating empathy (clear, 99 [99%] vs covered, 85 [85%]; P < .001), and building trust (clear, 94 [94%] vs covered, 72 [72%]; P < .001). Patients preferred clear masks (clear, 100 [100%] vs covered, 72 [72%]; P < .001), citing improved surgeon communication and appreciation for visualization of the face. Conversely, 8 of 15 surgeons (53%) were unlikely to choose the clear mask over their standard covered mask. Conclusions and Relevance: This randomized clinical trial demonstrates that patients prefer to see their surgeon's face. Surgeons who wore clear masks were perceived by patients to be better communicators, have more empathy, and elicit greater trust. Because masks will remain part of the health care landscape for some time, deliberate attention to preserving communication within the surgeon-patient relationship is warranted.

441897,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome due to COVID-19 among children and adolescents in Brazil: profile of deaths and hospital lethality as at Epidemiological Week 38, 2020",2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Delta variant quickly rose to dominance in mid-2021, displacing other variants, including Alpha. Studies using data from the United Kingdom and India estimated that Delta was 40-80% more transmissible than Alpha, allowing Delta to become the globally dominant variant. However, it was unclear if the ostensible difference in relative transmissibility was due mostly to innate properties of Deltas infectiousness or differences in the study populations. To investigate, we formed a partnership with SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance programs from all six New England US states. By comparing logistic growth rates, we found that Delta emerged 37-163% faster than Alpha in early 2021 (37% Massachusetts, 75% New Hampshire, 95% Maine, 98% Rhode Island, 151% Connecticut, and 163% Vermont). We next computed variant-specific effective reproductive numbers and estimated that Delta was 58-120% more transmissible than Alpha across New England (58% New Hampshire, 68% Massachusetts, 76% Connecticut, 85% Rhode Island, 98% Maine, and 120% Vermont). Finally, using RT-PCR data, we estimated that Delta infections generate on average [~]6 times more viral RNA copies per mL than Alpha infections. Overall, our evidence indicates that Deltas enhanced transmissibility could be attributed to its innate ability to increase infectiousness, but its epidemiological dynamics may vary depending on the underlying immunity and behavior of distinct populations.","Earnest, Rebecca; Uddin, Rockib; Matluk, Nicholas; Renzette, Nicholas; Siddle, Katherine J.; Loreth, Christine; Adams, Gordon; Tomkins-Tinch, Christopher; Petrone, Mary E.; Rothman, Jessica E.; Breban, Mallery I.; Koch, Robert Tobias; Billig, Kendall; Fauver, Joseph R.; Vogels, Chantal B.F.; Turbett, Sarah; Bilguvar, Kaya; Kumar, Bony De; Landry, Marie L.; Peaper, David R.; Kelly, Kevin; Omerza, Greg; Grieser, Heather; Meak, Sim; Martha, John; Dewey, Hannah H.; Kales, Susan; Berenzy, Daniel; Carpenter-Azevedo, Kristin; King, Ewa; Huard, Richard C.; Smole, Sandra C.; Brown, Catherine M.; Fink, Timelia; Lang, Andrew S.; Gallagher, Glen R.; Sabeti, Pardis C.; Gabriel, Stacey; MacInnis, Bronwyn L.; Team, - New England Variant Investigation; Tewhey, Ryan; Adams, Mark D.; Park, Daniel J.; Lemieux, Jacob E.; Grubaugh, Nathan D.",,,271

We examined feature importance across 2787 counties in the United States using data-driven machine learning models. Existing mathematical models of disease spread usually focused on the case prediction with different infection rates without incorporating multiple heterogeneous features that could impact the spatial and temporal trajectory of COVID-19. Recognizing this, we trained a data-driven model using 23 features representing six key influencing factors affecting the pandemic spread: social demographics of counties, population activities, mobility within the counties, movement across counties, disease attributes, and social network structure. Also, we categorized counties into multiple groups according to their population densities, and we divided the trajectory of COVID-19 into three stages: the outbreak stage, the social distancing stage, and the reopening stage. The study aimed to answer two research questions: (1) The extent to which the importance of heterogeneous features evolved at different stages; (2) The extent to which the importance of heterogeneous features varied across counties with different characteristics. We fitted a set of random forest models to determine weekly feature importance. The results showed that: (1) Social demographic features, such as gross domestic product, population density, and minority status maintained high-importance features throughout stages of COVID-19 across 2787 studied counties; (2) Within-county mobility features had the highest importance in counties with higher population densities; (3) The feature reflecting the social network structure (Facebook, social connectedness index), had higher importance for counties with higher population densities. The results showed that the data-driven machine learning models could provide important insights to inform policymakers regarding feature importance for counties with various population densities and at different stages of a pandemic life cycle.","Li, Qingchun; Yang, Yang; Wang, Wanqiu; Lee, Sanghyeon; Xiao, Xin; Gao, Xinyu; Oztekin, Bora; Fan, Chao; Mostafavi, Ali",Sci Rep,,271

450916,Inter-Region Transfers for Pandemic Surges,2020,"BACKGROUND: Whether young adults who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk of subsequent infection is uncertain. We investigated the risk of subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection among young adults seropositive for a previous infection. METHODS: This analysis was performed as part of the prospective COVID-19 Health Action Response for Marines study (CHARM). CHARM included predominantly male US Marine recruits, aged 18-20 years, following a 2-week unsupervised quarantine at home. After the home quarantine period, upon arrival at a Marine-supervised 2-week quarantine facility (college campus or hotel), participants were enrolled and were assessed for baseline SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity, defined as a dilution of 1:150 or more on receptor-binding domain and full-length spike protein ELISA. Participants also completed a questionnaire consisting of demographic information, risk factors, reporting of 14 specific COVID-19-related symptoms or any other unspecified symptom, and brief medical history. SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed by PCR at weeks 0, 1, and 2 of quarantine and participants completed a follow-up questionnaire, which included questions about the same COVID-19-related symptoms since the last study visit. Participants were excluded at this stage if they had a positive PCR test during quarantine. Participants who had three negative swab PCR results during quarantine and a baseline serum serology test at the beginning of the supervised quarantine that identified them as seronegative or seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 then went on to basic training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot-Parris Island. Three PCR tests were done at weeks 2, 4, and 6 in both seropositive and seronegative groups, along with the follow-up symptom questionnaire and baseline neutralising antibody titres on all subsequently infected seropositive and selected seropositive uninfected participants (prospective study period). FINDINGS: Between May 11, 2020, and Nov 2, 2020, we enrolled 3249 participants, of whom 3168 (98%) continued into the 2-week quarantine period. 3076 (95%) participants, 2825 (92%) of whom were men, were then followed up during the prospective study period after quarantine for 6 weeks. Among 189 seropositive participants, 19 (10%) had at least one positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the 6-week follow-up (1·1 cases per person-year). In contrast, 1079 (48%) of 2247 seronegative participants tested positive (6·2 cases per person-year). The incidence rate ratio was 0·18 (95% CI 0·11-0·28; p<0·001). Among seropositive recruits, infection was more likely with lower baseline full-length spike protein IgG titres than in those with higher baseline full-length spike protein IgG titres (hazard ratio 0·45 [95% CI 0·32-0·65]; p<0·001). Infected seropositive participants had viral loads that were about 10-times lower than those of infected seronegative participants (ORF1ab gene cycle threshold difference 3·95 [95% CI 1·23-6·67]; p=0·004). Among seropositive participants, baseline neutralising titres were detected in 45 (83%) of 54 uninfected and in six (32%) of 19 infected participants during the 6 weeks of observation (ID50 difference p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Seropositive young adults had about one-fifth the risk of subsequent infection compared with seronegative individuals. Although antibodies induced by initial infection are largely protective, they do not guarantee effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation activity or immunity against subsequent infection. These findings might be relevant for optimisation of mass vaccination strategies.

452534,Risks of AKI and Major Adverse Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate how the obstetrics and gynaecology residency program and trainees have been affected by the Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic in Europe. STUDY DESIGN: This study is a cross-sectional explorative survey using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised of 40 questions that were subdivided into 4 subjects; workload, specialist training aspects in obstetrics and gynaecology, health and safety of the trainee and women's health and maternal health issues. Inclusion criteria consisted of being a trainee in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (ObGyn) at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe or trainees who had recently finished their training during the time of the outbreak. Taking part in the survey was voluntary. The questionnaire was shared on the website of the European Network for Trainees in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (ENTOG), ENTOG social media, in the ENTOG-newsletter and through the national representatives of ENTOG. RESULTS: 110 ObGyn trainees from 25 different countries responded to the questionnaire. Almost all trainees (95 %, N = 105) reported an effect on their training due to COVID-19 pandemic. Training was interrupted in 21 % of cases (n = 23). Trainees observed a decrease in educational activities or lectures and a decrease in number of patients. The possibility of training surgical skills decreased, because 67 % (N = 74) trainees reported that surgeries were cancelled. Trainees expressed concerns about reaching the goals of their ObGyn specialist training in 60 % (n = 66) of cases. A decrease in workload was experienced during the first COVID-19 wave in Europe by 60 % (n = 66) of trainees. On average these trainees worked 33 % less hours compared to a normal workweek. Although 22 % (n = 24) were expected to be available continuously for 24 h a day and 7 days a week for unscheduled duties, 15 % (n = 16) were deployed to work on special COVID-units. Concerning preparation, 45 % of the trainees (n = 50) had not received any training for treating COVID-positive patients. Trainees claimed to have enough personal protective equipment (PPE), although problems were reported. Any form of psychosocial support was arranged for 65 % of trainees (n = 71) by the hospital or department. The results of the survey suggest that obstetric care was not affected much (92 % (n = 102) of the respondents said at least necessary care continued) while patients in need for reproductive medicine were affected the most; out of the 110 departments 58 % (n = 60) were closed and 35 % (n = 36) reduced their activities. Access to family planning and benign gynaecology were also significantly reduced; 77 % and 87 % respectively of the departments were less accessible or only open to emergency cases. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous effect on the ObGyn training in Europe. Exposure to learning opportunities, surgeries and teaching has been decreased during the outbreak and may result in a decrease in quality of care provided to women in the future if impairment of training is not recovered.","Boekhorst, Ferry; Khattak, Hajra; Topcu, Elif Goknur; Horala, Agnieszka; Gonçalves Henriques, Manuel",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,,271
453703,Children in Critical Care Due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection: Experience in a Spanish Hospital,2020,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis. Little is known about the protective factors of this infection. Therefore, preventive health measures that can reduce the risk of infection, progression and severity are desperately needed. This review discussed the possible roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory tract infections and severity. Moreover, this study determined the correlation of vitamin D levels with COVID-19 cases and deaths in 20 European countries as of 20 May 2020. A significant negative correlation (p=0.033) has been observed between mean vitamin D levels and COVID-19 cases per one million population in European countries. However, the correlation of vitamin D with COVID-19 deaths of these countries was not significant. Some retrospective studies demonstrated a correlation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality, while other studies did not find the correlation when confounding variables are adjusted. Several studies demonstrated the role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of acute viral respiratory tract infections and pneumonia. These include direct inhibition with viral replication or with anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory ways. In the meta-analysis, vitamin D supplementation has been shown as safe and effective against acute respiratory tract infections. Thus, people who are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency during this global pandemic should consider taking vitamin D supplements to maintain the circulating 25(OH)D in the optimal levels (75-125nmol/L). In conclusion, there is not enough evidence on the association between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 severity and mortality. Therefore, randomized control trials and cohort studies are necessary to test this hypothesis.","Ali, Nurshad",J Infect Public Health,,271

462148,When infections don't reflect infectiousness: interpreting contact investigation data with care,2020,"Abstract Objective: To define diagnostic criteria for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on computed tomography (CT); to study the correlation between CT and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; and to determine whether the extent of parenchymal involvement and the need for mechanical ventilation are associated with the CT findings and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study of 155 patients with COVID-19 treated between March and May 2020. We attempted to determine whether the CT findings correlated with age and clinical variables, as well as whether the need for mechanical ventilation correlated with the extent of the pulmonary involvement. Results: On average, the patients with COVID-19 were older than were those without (mean age, 54.8 years vs. 45.5 years; p = 0.031). The most common CT finding (seen in 88.6%) was ground-glass opacity, which correlated significantly with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (p = 0.0001). The CT findings that correlated most strongly with the need for mechanical ventilation were parenchymal bands (p = 0.013), bronchial ectasia (p = 0.046), and peribronchovascular consolidations (p = 0.012). The presence of one or more comorbidities correlated significantly with more extensive parenchymal involvement (p = 0.023). For the diagnosis of COVID-19, CT had a sensitivity of 84.3%, a specificity of 36.7%, and an accuracy of 73.5% (p = 0.012 vs. PCR). Conclusion: The patterns of CT findings are useful for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the evaluation of disease severity criteria. The presence of any comorbidity is associated with greater severity of COVID-19.","Mogami, Roberto; Lopes, Agnaldo Jose; Araújo Filho, Ronaldo Carvalho; Almeida, Fernando Carlos Santos de; Messeder, Alexandre Malta da Costa; Koifman, Ana Celia Baptista; Guimarães, Amanda Barbosa; Monteiro, Alexandra",Radiol. bras,,271

Meaningful preventive solutions have been taken with smartphone selfie/geofencing apps toward managing mandatory home quarantine and physical distancing. In the post-COVID world, fast screening and strict quarantine can play a crucial role in bringing back normality. Quarantine being offered at home can be a comfortable solution for both government and patients. On the other hand, it can be hazardous if not strictly followed and adequately realized. However, the existing geofencing/face selfie apps take static photographs and location data at certain time intervals that can allow patients to violate the rules between those periods, thus failing to ensure active user identity. To realize unbreached home quarantine policies, this article introduces a CUBA-HQM smartphone app that performs continuous user biometric authentication (CUBA) augmented with geofencing using AI technology. The purpose of continuous tracking is to strictly control the spread of infectious diseases in society by monitoring the individual move in/out in the quarantine zone.","Jaswal, G.; Bharadwaj, R.; Tiwari, K.; Thapar, D.; Goyal, P.; Nigam, A.",Ieee Consumer Electronics Magazine,,271

Starting with the description of our case series, we evaluated the clinical presentation and evolution of COVID-19. This article is addressed particularly to physicians caring for patients with COVID-19 in their clinical practice. The intent is to identify the subjects in whom the infection is most likely to evolve and the best methods of management in the early phase of infection to determine which patients should be hospitalized and which could be monitored at home. Asymptomatic patients should be followed to evaluate the appearance of symptoms. Patients with mild symptoms lasting more than a week, and without evidence of pneumonia, can be managed at home. Patients with evidence of pulmonary involvement, especially in patients over 60 years of age, and/or with a comorbidity, and/or with the presence of severe extrapulmonary manifestations, should be admitted to a hospital for careful clinical-laboratory monitoring.","Macera, Margherita; De Angelis, Giulia; Sagnelli, Caterina; Coppola, Nicola",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,271

However, a significant proportion of people report that they do not intend to have a vaccine, often because of concerns they have about vaccine side effects or safety. This study will assess the impact of theory-based messages on COVID-19 vaccination intention, drawing on the Necessity-Concerns framework to address previously reported beliefs and concerns about COVID-19 vaccination, and assess whether hypothesised variables (illness coherence, perceived necessity and concerns) mediate change in vaccination intention. TRIAL DESIGN: Prospective, parallel two-arm, individually randomised (1:1) trial. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged over 18 years, living in Scotland and not vaccinated for COVID-19. A quota sampling approach will be used with the aim of achieving a nationally representative sample on gender, region and ethnic group, with oversampling of individuals with no educational qualifications or with only school-level qualifications. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: Brief exposure to online text and image-based messages addressing necessity beliefs and concerns about COVID-19 vaccination. Comparator: Brief exposure to online text and image-based messages containing general information about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary outcome: Self-reported intention to receive a vaccine for COVID-19 if invited, immediately post-intervention. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Self-reported COVID-19 illness coherence, perceived necessity of a COVID-19 vaccine and concerns about a COVID-19 vaccine, immediately post-intervention. RANDOMISATION: Quasi-randomisation performed automatically by online survey software, by creating a variable derived from the number of seconds in the minute that the participant initiates the survey. Participants starting the survey at 0-14 or 30-44 seconds in the minute are allocated to the intervention and 15-29 or 45-59 seconds to the comparator.

Herein, we investigated policies for advancing the development of pediatric medical devices in Japan and the United States. Considering the achievements of each policy, we proposed a strategy to promote further development of pediatric medical devices in Japan. We investigated policies for supporting the development of pediatric medical devices and approved cases in Japan and the United States by searching contents of websites of regulatory bodies and other related administrations, and scientific papers. We found the main six policies in Japan and nine main policies in the United States for the development of pediatric medical devices. In the United States, various measures have initiated mainly in the 2000s, while in Japan, the main measures have been in place since 2013. Similarities were found in both countries, such as subsidies for application fees and research and development expenses, exemption of requirements for regulatory approval, and priority review and consultation by the regulatory body. Our study revealed that there are similarities in initiatives by both countries. To promote further development of pediatric medical devices in the future, improvements to expediting the review process to approval by the regulatory body, global development, and implementation of alternative measures to ensure the efficacy and safety of the device instead of large-scale clinical trials should be anticipated through cooperation among industry, government, and academia.","Takahashi, Sara; Iwasaki, Kiyotaka; Shirato, Haruki; Ho, Mami; Umezu, Mitsuo",J. artif. organs,,271
477341,Reduction of Coronavirus Burden With Mass Azithromycin Distribution,2020,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and compare the performance of radiomics in predicting induction chemotherapy response treated with two different regimens in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 265 patients with pathologically confirmed locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (stage II-IV), including 115 treated with gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GP group) and 150 treated with docetaxel plus cisplatin (TP group) were retrospectively enrolled. Radiomics features were extracted from the volume of interest delineated in multi-MR sequences on a 3T scanner. After random stratified grouping (training and validation cohorts) and logistic regression based on selected features, the association between the radiomics signature and the early response to induction chemotherapy were established for GP and TP regiments, respectively. RESULTS: Clinical factors showed no significant difference between the response and non-response groups for the GP and TP regiments (all p > 0.05). The accuracy of the radiomics signature consisting of selected features from the joint T1, T2, and T1C in the GP group (0.852 in the training cohort vs. 0.853 in the validation cohort) was significantly higher than that in the TP group (0.774 vs 0.727). The overall performance of the GP model was steady, with efficiency to distinguish responders from nonresponders with an AUC reaching 0.907 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.843-0.970]) in the training cohort and 0.886 (95% CI [0.772-0.998]) in the validation cohort, while leveling at 0.800 (95% CI [0.712-0.888]) in the training cohort and 0.863 (95% CI [0.758-0.967]) in the validation cohort in the TP group. CONCLUSION: Pretreatment MR radiomics signature can better predict the early response to IC in the GP regimen than the TP regimen, which may be helpful to guide IC management.","Zhang, Lei; Ye, Zhimin; Ruan, Lei; Jiang, Mingxiang",Acad. radiol,,271

Leptin produced in visceral fat might play a role in the deterioration to mechanical ventilation. A cross sectional study was performed. The mean BMI was 31 kg/m 2(range 24.8–48.4) for the 31 SARS-CoV-2 ventilated patients and 26 kg/m 2(range 22.4–33.5) for 8 critically ill non-infected control patients. SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with a similar BMI as control patients appear to have significantly higher levels of serum leptin. The mean leptin level was 21.2 (6.0–85.2) vs 5.6 (2.4–8.2) ug/L for SARS-CoV-2 and controls respectively (p = 0.0007). With these findings we describe a clinical and biological framework that may explain these clinical observations. The ACE2 utilization by the virus leads to local pulmonary inflammation due to ACE2-ATII disbalance. This might be enhanced by an increase in leptin production induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection of visceral fat. Leptin receptors in the lungs are now more activated to enhance local pulmonary inflammation. This adds to the pre-existent chronic inflammation in obese patients. Visceral fat, lung tissue and leptin production play an interconnecting role. This insight can lead the way to further research and treatment.","van der Voort, Peter H.J.; Moser, Jill; Zandstra, Durk F.; Muller Kobold, Anneke C.; Knoester, Marjolein; Calkhoven, Cornelis F.; Hamming, Inge; van Meurs, Matijs",Heliyon,,271

Similarly, histone deacetylation represses transcription of genes responsible for cell differentiation/death. A previous clinical study suggested potential pharmacodynamic antagonism between histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and DNA hypomethylating agents (HMA). Herein, to determine such antagonism, we used MDS/AML lines and NHD13 transgenic mice, and demonstrated that treatment with the pan-HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) significantly decreased TET2 expression and global 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels. Mechanistically, our RNAi screen revealed that HDAC4 was responsible for maintaining TET2 levels. Accordingly, HDAC4 knockout reduced expression levels of MTSS1, a known TET2 target, an event associated with decreased 5hmC enrichment on the MTSS1 enhancer. Retrospective analysis of GEO datasets demonstrated that lower HDAC4 levels predict worse prognosis for AML patients. In an MDS-L xenografted immunodeficient mouse model, vitamin C co-treatment prevented TET2 loss of activity seen following SAHA treatment. Accordingly, vitamin C co-treatment further reduced MDS-L cell engraftment relative to SAHA alone. In summary, our findings suggest that co-administration of a TET2 agonist with pan-HDACi treatment could effectively counter potential diminution in TET2 activity resulting from pan-HDACi treatment alone, providing a rationale for evaluating such combinations against high-risk MDS/AML.","Huang, Feiteng; Sun, Jie; Chen, Wei; He, Xin; Zhu, Yinghui; Dong, Haojie; Wang, Hanying; Li, Zheng; Zhang, Lei; Khaled, Samer; Marcucci, Guido; Huang, Jinwen; Li, Ling","Aging (Albany, N.Y.

The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), uses its nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) to redirect host translation machinery to the viral RNA by binding to the ribosome and suppressing cellular, but not viral, protein synthesis through yet unknown mechanisms. We show here that among all viral proteins, Nsp1 has the largest impact on host viability in the cells of human lung origin. Differential expression analysis of mRNA-seq data revealed that Nsp1 broadly alters the transcriptome in human cells. The changes include repression of major gene clusters in ribosomal RNA processing, translation, mitochondria function, cell cycle and antigen presentation; and induction of factors in transcriptional regulation. We further gained a mechanistic understanding of the Nsp1 function by determining the cryo-EM structure of the Nsp1-40S ribosomal subunit complex, which shows that Nsp1 inhibits translation by plugging the mRNA entry channel of the 40S. We also determined the cryo-EM structure of the 48S preinitiation complex (PIC) formed by Nsp1, 40S, and the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNA, which shows that this 48S PIC is nonfunctional due to the incorrect position of the 3’ region of the mRNA. Results presented here elucidate the mechanism of host translation inhibition by SARS-CoV-2, provide insight into viral protein synthesis, and furnish a comprehensive understanding of the impacts from one of the most potent pathogenicity factors of SARS-CoV-2.

The aims of this study were to determine the current use of ECT and to compare the findings with those of the previous survey. METHODS: Two questionnaires were sent to all 48 inpatient psychiatric centers in Poland. The first one - to units providing ECT to explore its practice, and the second - to units not performing ECT to explore the reasons for not using this treatment. RESULTS: Nineteen (39.6%) of all psychiatric inpatient centers confirmed the use of ECT. The utilization rate was 0.13 patients/10,000 inhabitants. Similar to the findings from 2005, the main indications were affective disorders, and bitemporal electrode placement was the dominant method used for the delivery of ECT. Age-based and titration-based methods were applied exclusively in 50% and 25% of the centers, respectively (compared with 15% and 35% in 2005, respectively), while both methods were used in the remaining 25%. Improvements in safety were reflected by the use of comprehensive pre-ECT evaluation and treatment monitoring. None of the centers used sine-wave devices; this contrasts with their use by 29% of the centers in 2005. The main reasons for not using ECT were insufficient funding and a lack of experienced staff. CONCLUSION: The frequency of ECT use in Poland remains very low. In view of the improvement in the quality of health services in the past decade, such a markedly rare use of an effective treatment was unexpected. There is an urgent need of education to create more positive attitude towards ECT among health professionals and among public, and to increase the training of mental health professionals in ECT.","Antosik-Wójcińska, Anna Z; Dominiak, Monika; Mierzejewski, Paweł; Jażdżyk, Piotr; Gazdag, Gabor; Takacs, Rozalia; Wichniak, Adam",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,https://doi.org/10.2147/ndt.s296210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33654402/,271

The epidemiological transition in Vietnam, combined with an urgent need for improving efficiency of the national health system under the government's administrative reforms, form important facilitators of restructuring the public health system. This paper explored the implementation processes of policy on establishment of the Centers for Diseases Control (CDC) in Vietnam during 2016-2019. Methods The study employed a cross-sectional and mixed methods design. Staff surveys were collected at 55 out of 63 provinces and in-depth interviews, focus groups were conducted in three purposefully selected provinces. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and qualitative data were analyzed thematically. The innovation implementation framework guided the study. Results After 3 years of introduction, 82.5% of provinces had established the CDCs. Implementation of CDC establishment policy was influenced by 1) management support; 2) alignment between policy and practice; 3) values towards CDC,; and 4) implementation climate.

This multicenter observational study evaluated the short‐term clinical outcomes in recipients with acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to COVID‐19. Out of 452 recipients following up at five centers, 50 had AKI secondary to COVID‐19. 42 recipients with at least 3‐month follow‐up were included. Median follow‐up was 5.23 months [IQR 4.09–6.99]. Severe COVID‐19 was seen in 21 (50%), and 12 (28.6%) had KDIGO stage 3 AKI. Complete recovery of graft function at 3 months was seen in 17 (40.5%) patients. Worsening of proteinuria was seen in 15 (37.5%) patients, and 4 (9.5%) patients had new onset proteinuria. Graft failure was seen in 6 (14.3%) patients. Kidney biopsy revealed acute tubular injury (9/11 patients), thrombotic microangiopathy (2/11), acute cellular rejection (2/11), and chronic active antibody‐mediated rejection (3/11). Patients with incomplete recovery were likely to have lower eGFR and proteinuria at baseline, historical allograft rejection, higher admission SOFA score, orthostatic hypotension, and KDIGO stage 3 AKI. Baseline proteinuria and the presence of orthostatic hypotension independently predicted incomplete graft recovery. This shows that graft recovery may remain incomplete after AKI secondary to COVID‐19.","Bajpai, Divya; Deb, Satarupa; Bose, Sreyashi; Gandhi, Chintan; Modi, Tulsi; Katyal, Abhinav; Saxena, Nikhil; Patil, Ankita; Thakare, Sayali; Pajai, Atim E.; Haridas, Ashwathy; Keskar, Vaibhav S.; Jawale, Sunil Y.; Sultan, Amar G.; Jamale, Tukaram E.",Transpl Int,https://doi.org/10.1111/tri.13886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33884672/,271

METHODS: We compared the number of JIA reactivations in the period March–July 2020 to the same months of 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: A total of 10 JIA reactivations have been documented on 58 patients (17%) visited in the period March–July 2018; 10 reactivations on 61 patients (16%) in the period March–July 2019; and 19 reactivations on 39 patients (49%) in the period March–July 2020, with a statistically significant increase (p <0.001). The other 19 patients who should have been visited during the same period, contacted by phone, indicated remission. Therefore, we hypothesize that the effective number of reactivations in the period March–July 2020 would be 19/58 patients (33%) which remains significantly greater than in the previous 2 years (p < 0.05). Among the 19 JIA patients reactivated in 2020, 3 spontaneously stopped the basic treatment due to parents’ choice for fear of serious complications in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 4 had poor compliance with underlying treatment. In addition, 14/19 reactivated JIA patients did not perform the scheduled check according to the follow-up. In fact, the mean time interval between two follow-up visits was significantly greater in 2020 (157 ± 53 days, p < 0.0001) vs 2018 (108 ± 68 days) and 2019 (107 ± 40 days). CONCLUSIONS: We have found a significant increase in JIA reactivations in the period March–July 2020 compared to the same interval of 2018 and 2019. This increase may have been caused by poor compliance with background treatment, as documented in 7/19 JIA patients reactivated, and by a greater interval in follow-up checks. Therefore, it is necessary, in occasion of a new pandemic and lockdown, to implement greater controls using more appropriate telemedicine tools.","Conti, Giovanni; Galletta, Francesca; Carucci, Nicolina Stefania; La Mazza, Antonella; Mollica, Salvatore Antonio; Alibrandi, Angela; Visalli, Carmela",Clin Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33733314/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-021-05694-8,271

614711,A case‐controlled study comparing clinical course and outcomes of pregnant and non‐pregnant women with severe acute respiratory syndrome,2004-06-09,"INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of oral hygiene behaviors (OHB) is very low among school children in Ethiopia. However, the determinants of student’s readiness/intention to perform those behaviors have been remained unstudied. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the determinants of oral hygiene behavioral intention (OHBI) among preparatory school students based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). METHODS AND MATERIALS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 393 students. A 98-item self-administered questionnaire was used to evaluate oral hygiene knowledge (OHK), oral hygiene behavior (OHB), and OHBI based on TPB variables [attitude (ATT), subjective norms (SN) and perceived behavioral control (PBC)]. Descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling analysis (SEM) were employed to confirm relationships and associations among study variables. A p-value of less than 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval were used to declare statistical significance. RESULTS: A total of 393 students were participated with a response rate of 97.5%. The mean age of the participants (54% females) was 18 (± 1.3) with an age range of 16 to 24. The TPB model was well fitted to the data and explained 66% of the variance in intention. ATT (β = 0.38; 95% CI, (0.21, 0.64)), SN (β = 0.33; 95% CI, (0.05, 0.83)) and PBC (β = 0.29; 95% CI, (0.13, 0.64)) were significant predictors of OHBI, where ATT was the strongest predictor of OHBI. CONCLUSION: The TPB model explained a large variance in the intention of students to improve their OHB. All TPB variables were significantly and positively linked to stronger intent, as the theory suggests. Furthermore, these results suggest that the model could provide a framework for oral hygiene promotion interventions in the study area. Indeed, these interventions should focus on changing the attitudes of students towards OHB, creation of positive social pressure, and enabling students to control over OHB barriers.","Shitu, Kegnie; Alemayehu, Mekuriaw; Buunk-Werkhoven, Yvonne A.

Despite the high level of compliance, participants expressed some uncertainty about what the process would involve. Conclusions: As hotel quarantine is introduced across the UK for international arrivals, our findings suggest that those in charge should: communicate effectively before, during and after quarantine, emphasising why quarantine is important and how it will protect others; avoid enforcement and focus on supporting and promoting voluntary compliance; facilitate shared social experiences for those in quarantine; and ensure all necessary supplies are provided. Doing so will increase adherence and reduce any negative effects on wellbeing.","Carter, H.; Weston, D.; Greenberg, N.; Oliver, I.; Robin, C.; Rubin, G.

The aim of the present study was to assess the clinical value of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in characterizing myocardial damage in active COVID-19 patients, through the correlation between qualitative and quantitative imaging biomarkers with clinical and laboratory evidence of myocardial injury. METHODS: In this retrospective observational cohort study, we enrolled 27 patients with diagnosis of active COVID-19 and suspected cardiac involvement, referred to our institution for CMR between March 2020 and January 2021. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, including high sensitivity troponin T (hs-cTnT), and CMR imaging data were obtained. Relationships between CMR parameters, clinical and laboratory findings were explored. Comparisons were made with age-, sex- and risk factor–matched control group of 27 individuals, including healthy controls and patients without other signs or history of myocardial disease, who underwent CMR examination between January 2020 and January 2021. RESULTS: The median (IQR) time interval between COVID-19 diagnosis and CMR examination was 20 (13.5–31.5) days. Hs-cTnT values were collected within 24 h prior to CMR and resulted abnormally increased in 18 patients (66.6%). A total of 20 cases (74%) presented tissue signal abnormalities, including increased myocardial native T1 (n = 11), myocardial T2 (n = 14) and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) (n = 10), late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) (n = 12) or pericardial enhancement (n = 2). A CMR diagnosis of myocarditis was established in 9 (33.3%), pericarditis in 2 (7.4%) and myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries in 3 (11.11%) patients. T2 mapping values showed a moderate positive linear correlation with Hs-cTnT (r = 0.58; p = 0.002). A high degree positive linear correlation between ECV and Hs-cTnT was also found (r 0.77; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CMR allows in vivo recognition and characterization of myocardial damage in a cohort of selected COVID-19 individuals by means of a multiparametric scanning protocol including conventional imaging and T1–T2 mapping sequences. Abnormal T2 mapping was the most commonly abnormality observed in our cohort and positively correlated with hs-cTnT values, reflecting the predominant edematous changes characterizing the active phase of disease.

631134,Symptom Severity Patterns in Experimental Common Colds and Their Usefulness in Timing Onset of Illness in Natural Colds,2003-03-15,"Background: To date, only dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab has been recently added to the treatment guidelines for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but data remains conflicting. Methods: Electronic databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane central were searched from March 1, 2020, until February 28th, 2021, for RCTs evaluating the efficacy of tocilizumab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The outcomes assessed were mortality at 28 days, mechanical ventilation, and time to discharge. Results: Eight studies (with 6,311 patients) were included in the analysis. In total, 3,267 patients received tocilizumab, and 3,044 received standard care/placebo. Pooled analysis showed a significantly decreased risk of mortality at 28 days (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83-0.97, p=0.009) and progression to mechanical ventilation (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70-0.90, p=0.0002) in the tocilizumab arm compared to standard therapy or placebo. In addition, there was a trend towards improved median time to hospital discharge (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05-1.34, p=0.007). Conclusions: Tocilizumab therapy improves outcomes of mortality and need for mechanical ventilation, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection compared with standard therapy or placebo. Our findings suggest the efficacy of tocilizumab therapy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and strengthen the concept that tocilizumab is a promising therapeutic intervention to improve mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 patients.","Selvaraj, V.; Saud Khan, M.; Bavishi, C.; Dapaah-Afriyie, K.; Finn, A.; Lal, A.; Mylonakis, E.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.21254054v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.23.21254054,271

Covid-19 deaths per 100 hospital beds were used as a proxy for bed capacity pressures. (3) Results: Hospital bed numbers show large variation between U.S. states and half of the states have equivalent beds to those in developing countries. Relatively low population density in over half of US states appeared to have limited the spread of Covid-19 thus averting a potential major hospital capacity crisis. (4) Conclusions: Many U.S. states had too few beds to cope with a major Covid-19 epidemic, but this was averted by low population density in many states, which seemed to limit the spread of the virus.","Jones, Rodney P",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17145210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32707674/,271
632948,Universal Precautions Studios Presents: ID Creature Features,2004-04-01,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new emerging respiratory virus, caused evolving pneumonia outbreak around the world. In SARS-Cov-2 infected patients, diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity are two metabolic diseases associated with higher severity of SARS-CoV-2 related complications, characterized by acute lung injury requiring assisted ventilation as well as fibrosis development in surviving patients. Different factors are potentially responsible for this exacerbated response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In patients with DM, base-line increase in inflammation and oxidative stress represent preexisting risk factors for virus-induced damages. Such factors are also likely to be found in obese patients. In addition, it has been proposed that massive injury to the alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells, which express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), leads to the activation of their stromal niches represented by the Lipofibroblasts (LIF). LIF are instrumental in maintaining the self-renewal of AT2 stem cells. LIF have been proposed to transdifferentiate into Myofibroblast (MYF) following injury to AT2 cells, thereby contributing to fibrosis. We hypothesized that LIF’s activity could be impacted by DM or obesity in an age- and gender-dependent manner, rendering them more prone to transition toward the profibrotic MYF status in the context of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Understanding the cumulative effects of DM and/or obesity in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the cellular level will be crucial for efficient therapeutic solutions.","Nouri-Keshtkar, Marjan; Taghizadeh, Sara; Farhadi, Aisan; Ezaddoustdar, Aysan; Vesali, Samira; Hosseini, Roya; Totonchi, Mehdi; Kouhkan, Azam; Chen, Chengshui; Zhang, Jin-San; Bellusci, Saverio; Tahamtani, Yaser",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.676150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34307358/,271
636440,Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 pandemic in Turkey: A single‐centre experience,2021-08-03,"Lipoproteins interact with immune cells, macrophages and endothelial cells - key players of the innate and adaptive immune system. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles seem to have evolved as part of the innate immune system since certain HDL subspecies contain combinations of apolipoproteins with immune regulatory functions. HDL is enriched in anti-inflammatory lipids, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate and certain saturated lysophospholipids. HDL reduces inflammation and protects against infection by modulating immune cell function, vasodilation and endothelial barrier function. HDL suppresses immune cell activation at least in part by modulating the cholesterol content in cholesterol/sphingolipid-rich membrane domains (lipid rafts), which play a critical role in the compartmentalization of signaling pathways. Acute infections, inflammation or autoimmune diseases lower HDL cholesterol levels and significantly alter HDL metabolism, composition and function. Such alterations could have a major impact on disease progression and may affect the risk for infections and cardiovascular disease. This review article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the immune cell modulatory activities of HDL. We focus on newly discovered activities of HDL-associated apolipoproteins, enzymes, lipids, and HDL mimetic peptides.","Trakaki, Athina; Marsche, Gunther",Biomedicines,https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9060587; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34064071/,271
637411,Remdesivir Use in the Setting of Severe Renal Impairment: A Theoretical Concern or Real Risk?,2020-12-14,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected how clinical trials are managed, both within existing portfolios and for the rapidly developed COVID-19 trials. Sponsors or delegated organisations responsible for monitoring trials have needed to consider and implement alternative ways of working due to the national infection risk necessitating restricted movement of staff and public, reduced clinical staff resource as research staff moved to clinical areas, and amended working arrangements for sponsor and sponsor delegates as staff moved to working from home. Organisations have often worked in isolation to fast track mitigations required for the conduct of clinical trials during the pandemic; this paper describes many of the learnings from a group of monitoring leads based in United Kingdom Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC) Clinical Trials Unit (CTUs) within the UK. The UKCRC Monitoring Task and Finish Group, comprising monitoring leads from 9 CTUs, met repeatedly to identify how COVID-19 had affected clinical trial monitoring. Informed consent is included as a specific issue within this paper, as review of completed consent documentation is often required within trial monitoring plans (TMPs). Monitoring is defined as involving on-site monitoring, central monitoring or/and remote monitoring. Monitoring, required to protect the safety of the patients and the integrity of the trial and ensure the protocol is followed, is often best done by a combination of central, remote and on-site monitoring. However, if on-site monitoring is not possible, workable solutions can be found using only central or central and remote monitoring. eConsent, consent by a third person, or via remote means is plausible. Minimising datasets to the critical data reduces workload for sites and CTU staff. Home working caused by COVID-19 has made electronic trial master files (TMFs) more inviting. Allowing sites to book and attend protocol training at a time convenient to them has been successful and worth pursuing for trials with many sites in the future. The arrival of COVID-19 in the UK has forced consideration of and changes to how clinical trials are conducted in relation to monitoring. Some developed practices will be useful in other pandemics and others should be incorporated into regular use.","Love, Sharon B.; Armstrong, Emma; Bayliss, Carrie; Boulter, Melanie; Fox, Lisa; Grumett, Joanne; Rafferty, Patricia; Temesi, Barbara; Wills, Krista; Corkhill, Andrea",Trials,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33853635/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-021-05225-5,271

The aims of this project were to develop a series of fleximer base analogues that not only possess inherent flexibility that can remain active when faced with binding site mutations, but also target a non-canonical, highly conserved target: the nucleocapsid protein of HIV (NC). The compounds were predicted by computational studies not to function via zinc ejection, which would endow them with significant advantages over non-specific and thus toxic zinc-ejectors.

Rapid diagnosis, new therapeutics and effective vaccines will all be required to stop the spread of COVID-19. Quantitative evaluation of serum antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 virus provides a means of monitoring a patient's immune response to a natural viral infection or vaccination, as well as evidence of a prior infection. In this paper, a portable and low-cost electrochemical immunosensor is developed for the rapid and accurate quantification of SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies. The immunosensor is capable of quantifying the concentrations of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in human serum. For IgG and IgM, it provides measurements in the range of 10.1 ng/mL--60 g/mL and 1.64 ng/mL -- 50 g/mL, respectively, and both antibodies can be assayed in 13 min. We also developed device stabilization and storage strategies to achieve stable performance of the immunosensor within 24-week storage at room temperature. We evaluated the performance of the immunosensor using COVID-19 patient serum samples collected at different time points after symptom onset. The rapid and sensitive detection of IgG and IgM provided by our immunosensor fulfills the need of rapid COVID-19 serology testing for both point-of-care diagnosis and population immunity screening.","Peng, R.; Pan, Y.; Li, Z.; Qin, Z.; Rini, J.

652977,Results of a Shortened Quarantine Protocol on a Midwestern College Campus,2021-05-12,"Accurate assessment of neutralizing antibody activities is important either for patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or for animals and volunteers immunized with the experimental vaccines against the SARS associated coronavirus (SCV). However, the current assay based on the cytopathic effect (CPE) which has been frequently cited in literature has several limitations. The CPE assay relies on the visual observation on the damage of SCV infected target cells under a microscope. It is subjected to observer variations and it is difficult to generate a quantitative determination of neutralizing activities based on the level of CPE. In the current study, we established the utility of two additional assays to measure the neutralizing activities against SCV: the plaque reduction (PR) and the neutral red staining (NRS) assays. The PR assay described in this study was modified from the traditional viral plaque reduction assay by using an improved crystal staining method to achieve better plague formation in SCV infected Vero E6 cells. The NRS neutralization assay was adopted from a similar system used for detecting neutralizing antibody responses against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In this assay, the protective effect of neutralizing antibodies was determined by the cell viability which is measured by the uptake of neutral red dye at A(540). The neutralizing antibody titers can be easily determined with either of the two new assays. In this report, we described the utility of these two new neutralization assays in measuring the neutralizing activities against SCV infection from rabbit sera immunized with various forms of spike protein of SCV.","Wang, Shixia; Sakhatskyy, Pavlo; Chou, Te-Hui W.; Lu, Shan",J Immunol Methods,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022175905000839; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15894326/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022175905000839,271

Long-term exposure to air pollution, especially PM2.5, has also been associated with COVID-19 mortality. We collated individual-level data of confirmed COVID-19 cases during the first wave of the epidemic in mainland China. We fitted a generalized linear model using city-level COVID-19 cases and severe cases as the outcome, and long-term average levels of air pollutants as the exposure. Our analysis was adjusted using several variables, including a mobile phone dataset, covering human movement from Wuhan before the travel ban and movements within each city during the time of emergency response. Other variables included census, smoking prevalence, climate, and socio-economic data from 324 cities in China. We adjusted for human mobility and socio-economic factors, and found that an increase in long-term NO2 or PM2.5 may correspond to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases and severe infections. However, the linkage might also be affected by the confounding factor of population size because of the predefined correlation between population size and air pollution. The results are derived from a large, newly compiled and geocoded repository of population and epidemiological data relevant to COVID-19. The findings of this paper (and other previous studies that have given ambiguous results) indicate that a more definitive analysis is needed of the link between COVID-19 and air pollution.","Zheng, Pai; Liu, Yonghong; Song, Hongbin; Wu, Chieh-Hsi; Li, Bingying; Kraemer, Moritz U.

Thus, we developed a loop-mediated isothermal nucleic acid amplification (LAMP) assay for the detection of HTLV-1/2 in blood samples. The sensitivity and accuracy of HTLV-1/2 LAMP were defined with DNA samples from individuals infected with HTLV-1 (n = 125), HTLV-2 (n = 19), and coinfected with HIV (n = 82), and compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The overall accuracy of HTLV-1/2 LAMP (95% CI 74.8–85.5%) was slightly superior to qPCR (95% CI 69.5–81.1%) and similar to PCR-RFLP (95% CI 79.5–89.3%). The sensitivity of LAMP was greater for HTLV-1 (95% CI 83.2–93.4%) than for HTLV-2 (95% CI 43.2–70.8%). This was also observed in qPCR and PCR-RFLP, which was associated with the commonly lower HTLV-2 proviral load. All molecular assays tested showed better results with samples from HTLV-1/2 mono-infected individuals compared with HIV-coinfected patients, who present lower CD4 T-cell counts. In conclusion, HTLV-1/2 LAMP had similar to superior performance than PCR-based assays, and therefore may represent an attractive alternative for HTLV-1/2 diagnosis due to reduced working time and costs, and the simple infrastructure needed.","Gomes, Yago; Caterino-de-Araujo, Adele; Campos, Karoline; Gonçalves, Maria Gisele; Leite, Ana Claudia; Lima, Marco Antonio; Araújo, Abelardo; Silva, Marcus Tulius; Espíndola, Otávio",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899621/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12090981,271
661424,Mechanism of Fulminant Pulmonary Edema Caused by Enterovirus 71,2004-06-15,"BACKGROUND: Surgeons are increasingly utilizing telemedicine to provide perioperative services to patients. Safety, satisfaction, and feasibility of these programs in general populations have been established, but it is unclear how telemedicine can be integrated into subspecialty care. We report results of a national survey related to telehealth practices among members of the Abdominal Core Health Quality Collaborative (ACHQC). METHODS: Survey responses were analyzed to determine current strategies in telemedicine utilization. Surgeon preferences, perceptions of validity, and identified barriers to implementation of telemedicine were assessed. RESULTS: Forty surgeons within the ACHQC responded, with 90% of respondents reporting use of telemedicine to deliver perioperative care to patients with hernias and abdominal core health concerns. Surgeons appeared to be more comfortable managing preoperative patients with image-confirmed diagnoses of hernias. Surgeons were universally more comfortable delivering postoperative care via telemedicine. Connectivity, patient engagement, and reimbursement were identified as potential barriers to expansion of telemedicine. Seventy-eight percent of respondents reported that they would increase telemedicine utilization if current regulations were maintained in the future. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that hernia specialists are utilizing telemedicine at a higher rate than before the COVID-19 pandemic, with surgeons reporting interest in continued use of this modality beyond the pandemic. These findings suggest that future work in telemedicine optimization may improve the quality of care that can be delivered to patients with abdominal core health concerns.

661792,Fecal Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) RNA Is Associated With Decreased Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Survival,2021-07-10,"Gambling Disorder (GD) has recently been reclassified from an impulse-control disorder to a behavioural addiction and, as in other addictive disorders, the dopaminergic reward system is involved. According to neuroimaging studies, alterations within the striatal dopaminergic signalling can occur in GD. However, the findings to date are controversial and there has been no agreement yet on how the reward system is affected on a molecular basis. Within the last 20 years, there has been growing evidence for a higher risk to develop GD in response to certain dopaminergic medication. Especially the dopamine agonists pramipexole and ropinirole, and the dopamine modulator aripiprazole seem to increase the likelihood for GD. The goal of this study was to examine the association between a prescription for either of the three pharmaceuticals and a GD diagnosis in a large cross-sectional study of the Swedish population. Compared to patients with any other dopaminergic drug prescription (38.7% with GD), the diagnosis was more common in patients with a dopamine agonist prescription (69.8% with GD), resulting in an odds ratio of 3.2. A similar association was found between aripiprazole prescriptions and GD diagnoses, which were analysed within the subgroup of all patients with schizophrenia or a schizotypal, delusional, or another non-mood psychotic disorder. An aripiprazole prescription increased the likelihood of GD (88.8%) in comparison to patients without an aripiprazole prescription (71.2%) with an odds ratio of 3.4. This study contributes to the increasingly reliable evidence for an association between several dopaminergic drugs and a higher risk for developing GD. Therefore, one future research goal should be a better understanding of the neurobiology in GD to be able to design more selective dopaminergic medication with less severe side effects. Additionally, this knowledge could enable the development of pharmacotherapy in GD and other addictive disorders.","Wolfschlag, Mirjam; Håkansson, Anders",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252516; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34061895/,271

672564,"Novel Canine Coronavirus Isolated from a Hospitalized Pneumonia Patient, East Malaysia",2021-05-20,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to major changes in the lives of people worldwide, including changes in personal and social habits. Faced with this global health emergency, governments have imposed strict mitigation measures. Within this context, and considering data from previous epidemics, it has been proposed that birth rates may have been negatively impacted. This study aimed to assess the trends in birth rates in three main industrial cities in Northern Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective and observational study. METHODS: Data on birth rates were collected and compared for the cities of Milan, Genoa and Turin from November 2019 to January 2020 (i.e. before the COVID-19 pandemic) and during the same period of the following year (i.e. during the COVID-19 pandemic). RESULTS: Birth rates in the cities of Milan, Genoa and Turin decreased by 55%, 12% and 33%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in birth rates during the COVID-19 pandemic in these three industrialised cities is in line with the demographic effects of previous pandemics. The negative impact of COVID-19 on conception may be a result of various underlying factors. Further studies are required to verify how social and demographic factors may influence birth rates during pandemics.","De Rose, A F; Ambrosini, F; Mantica, G; Terrone, C",Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.06.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352613/,271
673590,Venous Thromboembolism Events Following Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Based on CT Scans,2020-06-30,"Neutrophils are the “first line” of defense against pathogens in the locus of inflammation, where they use effector functions such as phagocytosis, degranulation, and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In 2004, Artuto Zychlinsky characterized one more neutrophil effector function—the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (or NETs). NETs are a modified chromatin “decorated” by bactericidal proteins of granules, nucleus, and cytoplasm. The release of NETs can be activated by diverse physiological and pharmacological stimuli and depends on ROS, for which NADPH oxidase is the main source. In the process of NET formation, the release of bactericidal components of granules into the cytoplasm, modification of histones leading to chromatin decondensation, destruction of the nuclear envelope and cytoplasmic membrane with the involvement of gasdermin D protein, and, finally, the release of chromatin outside the cell occurs. At the same time, uncontrolled formation of NETs is a provoking factor in the development of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. NETs were found at autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and vasculitis; NETs are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and oncological diseases. In this review, the main ideas about the mechanisms of NET formation, as well as their role in physiological processes and pathogenesis of a number of diseases (including COVID-19), are discussed.","Vorobjeva, N.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that RT-PCR has the sensitivity to detect one positive case in a mixed sample 32 cases [9]. In this paper we propose non-adaptive and adaptive group testing strategies based on generalized binary splitting (GBS) [2] where we restrict the group test to the largest group that can be used. The method starts by choosing a group from the population to be tested, performing a test on the combined sample from the entire group and progressively splitting the group further into subgroups. Compared to individual testing at 4% prevalence we save 74% at 1% we save 91% and at 1% we save 97% of tests. We analyze the number of times each sample is used and show the method is still efficient if we resort to testing a case individually if the sample is running low. Abstract In addition we recommend clinical screening to filter out individuals with symptoms and show this leaves us with a population with lower prevalence. Our approach is particularly applicable to vulnerable confined populations such as nursing homes, prisons, military ships and cruise ships.","Mentus, Cassidy; Romeo, Martin; DiPaola, Christian",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20050245,271

The CB questionnaires used for this study used a hypothetical disaster situation of bird flu in Kyoto, Japan. Safety, event, visitor information, and price discounting policies were designed accordingly. Respondents were then asked about their willingness to travel time. The results showed the optimal timing for devising pertinent policies during the year. We found that the first step requires a safety information announcement, within one week, immediately after disaster site decontamination. The second step is the implementation of event information policy within 24th to 36th week after the disaster. The third step constitutes announcing visitor information within the 37th to 52nd week after the second step. The final step is the implementation of price discounting policy, until the 52nd week, immediately after the third step.","Okuyama, Tadahiro",Tour Manag,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2017.07.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287752/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261517717301760; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517717301760,271

Methods we observed a case of fulminant purpura in a boy with SARS-CoV-2. A three years old boy had febrile fever, vomiting, abdominal pain for no apparent reason. On the 2nd day this boy had joint pain, petechial rashes, fever and abdominal pain persisted. The patient was hospitalized in the pediatric Department, where he was diagnosed with hemorrhagic vasculitis, there was prescribed therapy with glucocorticosteroids (1 mg/kg per day), dipyridamole (2.5 mg/kg per day), oral cephalosporin. Against the background of ongoing therapy, the child's condition became worth. On the 5th day of the disease appeared necrosis in the area of the ankle joints, heels, and toes, patient was transferred to the pediatric Department of Children's Clinical Regional Hospital. Results at the time of hospitalization, the child's condition was severe: the boy had persistent high fever, petechial rash on the torso and legs, necrosis in the area of the left ankle, outer surface of the right ankle and in the area of both heels, edema of the feet and hands. The boy was in a forced position, couldn’t not walk and had intense pain in the shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees and ankles. Blood tests revealed anemia (HGB 73 g/l), thrombocytopenia (PLT 120 x 10(9)/L), leukocytosis (WBC 23 x 10(9)/L), ESR 60 mm/h; in the clinical analysis of urine - proteinuria. In the blood test was detected significantly increased levels of CRP (129 mg/L), ferritin (637 ng/mL), triglycerides (1.39 mm/L), hypoproteinemia (48 g/L), hypoalbuminemia (31 g/L); the level of ALT, AST, LDH was normal. The level of D-dimer was 4792ng/mL, fibrinogen - 8.8 g/L, antithrombin III - 156%, protein C - 64%, coagulation Factor IX activity - 150 %, coagulation Factor VIII activity 289%. An increase of antinuclear antibodies, cardiolipins, phospholipids and ANCA were excluded. A nasopharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2 (was made on the 5th day of the disease). On 14th illness day we detected IgM antibodies directed toward SARS-CoV-2 in this patient (IgG antibodies directed toward SARS-CoV-2 were absent). An echocardiogram showed no coronary artery abnormalities, echocardiogram was normal, a chest CT and MRI of the brain also were normal. The diagnosis was fulminant purpura in a patient with SARS-CoV-2. This boy received heparin, IVIG 2 g/kg, dexamethasone 10 mg per meter of body surface a day, antibiotic therapy was continued. As a result fever, petechial rash and necrosis regressed. After 4 weeks we detected IgG antibodies directed toward SARS-CoV. Conclusion the current case demonstrates the possibility of developing a multi-system inflammatory syndrome like fulminant purpura in patients who had SARS-CoV-2. Disclosure N. Tsurikova: None. S.
