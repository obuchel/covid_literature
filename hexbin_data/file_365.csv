37,37,37,The influence of locked nucleic acid residues on the thermodynamic properties of 2′-O-methyl RNA/RNA heteroduplexes,9.222494,5.8312464,2005-09-09,"The influence of locked nucleic acid (LNA) residues on the thermodynamic properties of 2′-O-methyl RNA/RNA heteroduplexes is reported. Optical melting studies indicate that LNA incorporated into an otherwise 2′-O-methyl RNA oligonucleotide usually, but not always, enhances the stabilities of complementary duplexes formed with RNA. Several trends are apparent, including: (i) a 3′ terminal U LNA and 5′ terminal LNAs are less stabilizing than interior and other 3′ terminal LNAs; (ii) most of the stability enhancement is achieved when LNA nucleotides are separated by at least one 2′-O-methyl nucleotide; and (iii) the effects of LNA substitutions are approximately additive when the LNA nucleotides are separated by at least one 2′-O-methyl nucleotide. An equation is proposed to approximate the stabilities of complementary duplexes formed with RNA when at least one 2′-O-methyl nucleotide separates LNA nucleotides. The sequence dependence of 2′-O-methyl RNA/RNA duplexes appears to be similar to that of RNA/RNA duplexes, and preliminary nearest-neighbor free energy increments at 37°C are presented for 2′-O-methyl RNA/RNA duplexes. Internal mismatches with LNA nucleotides significantly destabilize duplexes with RNA.","Kierzek, Elzbieta; Ciesielska, Anna; Pasternak, Karol; Mathews, David H.; Turner, Douglas H.; Kierzek, Ryszard",Nucleic Acids Res,365,1
2076,2076,2076,Elevated level of renal xanthine oxidase mRNA transcription after nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus infection in growing layers,9.006599,6.4392896,2015-12-17,"To assess relationships between xanthine oxidase (XOD) and nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (NIBV) infection, 240 growing layers (35 days old) were randomly divided into two groups (infected and control) of 120 chickens each. Each chicken in the control and infected group was intranasally inoculated with 0.2 mL sterile physiological saline and virus, respectively, after which serum antioxidant parameters and renal XOD mRNA expression in growing layers were evaluated at 8, 15 and 22 days post-inoculation (dpi). The results showed that serum glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities in the infected group were significantly lower than in the control group at 8 and 15 dpi (p < 0.01), while serum malondialdehyde concentrations were significantly higher (p < 0.01). The serum uric acid was significantly higher than that of the control group at 15 dpi (p < 0.01). In addition, the kidney mRNA transcript level and serum activity of XOD in the infected group was significantly higher than that of the control group at 8, 15 and 22 dpi (p < 0.05). The results indicated that NIBV infection could cause the increases of renal XOD gene transcription and serum XOD activity, leading to hyperuricemia and reduction of antioxidants in the body.","Lin, Huayuan; Huang, Qiqi; Guo, Xiaoquan; Liu, Ping; Liu, Weilian; Zou, Yuelong; Zhu, Shuliang; Deng, Guangfu; Kuang, Jun; Zhang, Caiying; Cao, Huabin; Hu, Guoliang",J Vet Sci,365,28
2629,2629,2629,Multiplex Reverse-Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Coupled with Cascade Invasive Reaction and Nanoparticle Hybridization for Subtyping of Influenza A Virus,8.986755,8.965712,2017-03-21,"Considering the fatal human victims and economic loss caused by influenza virus infection every year, methodologies for rapid and on-site detection of influenza viruses are urgently needed. LAMP is the most commonly used nucleic acid isothermal amplification technology suitable for on-site use. However, for multiplex LAMP, differentiation of the amplicons derived from multiple targets is still challengeable currently. Here we developed a multiplex RT-LAMP assay for simultaneous amplification of three prominent subtypes of influenza viruses (A/H5, A/H7 and 2009A/H1). The amplicons were further identified by cascade invasive reaction and nanoparticle hybridization in separate target-specific detection tubes (referred to as mRT-LAMP-IRNH). The analytic sensitivities of the assay are 10 copies of RNA for all the three HA subtypes, and the specificity reached 100%. Clinical specimen analysis showed this assay had a combined sensitivity and specificity of 98.1% and 100%, respectively. Overall, the mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay can be used as a cost-saving method that utilizes a simple instrument to detect A/H5, A/H7, and 2009A/H1 influenza viruses, especially in resource-limited settings.","Chi, Ying; Ge, Yiyue; Zhao, Kangchen; Zou, Bingjie; Liu, Bin; Qi, Xian; Bian, Qian; Shi, Zhiyang; Zhu, Fengcai; Zhou, Minghao; Cui, Lunbiao; Su, Chuan",Sci Rep,365,28

It is, therefore, particularly important to develop a universal vaccine against conserved proteins or conserved regions of the virus. In this study, we used N-terminal extracellular region of the influenza virus M2 protein (M2e) as the target antigen and constructed two optimized M2e DNA vaccines (p-tPA-p3M2e and p-p3M2e) with increased antigenic epitope density and enhanced antigen secretion. Both vaccines induced high M2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in the vaccinated mice. These two vaccines also conferred protection against a lethal infection of homo-subtypic H1N1 virus, with p-tPA-p3M2e being the most effective. In addition, p-tPA-p3M2e also showed cross-protection against different subtypes of the influenza virus (H9N2, H6N6, and H10N8) at varying rates (80%, 40%, and 20%, respectively). After passive immunization, M2e DNA vaccine-induced antibodies in the sera provided complete protection against homologous virus challenge. An analysis of the mechanism underlying this immunization-mediated protection indicates that M2e-specific IgG and T-cell immune responses may play critical roles in the prevention of infection and viral clearance. Taken together, our results indicate that this optimized M2e DNA vaccine is a promising candidate for the development of a universal, broad-spectrum influenza virus vaccine.","Yao, Yanfeng; Wang, Huadong; Chen, Jianjun; Shao, Zhiyong; He, Bin; Chen, Jie; Lan, Jiaming; Chen, Quanjiao; Chen, Ze",Emerg Microbes Infect,365,28
3847,3847,3847,Serological evidence and experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques with pteropine orthoreovirus reveal monkeys as potential hosts for transmission to humans,9.121167,8.87498,2019-05-28,"Pteropine orthoreoviruses (PRV) are emerging bat-borne viruses with proven zoonotic transmission. We recently demonstrated human exposure to PRV in Singapore, which together with previous reports from Malaysia and Vietnam suggest that human infection of PRV may occur periodically in the region. This raises the question whether bats are the only sources of human infection. In this study, we screened 517 cynomolgus macaques caught in Singapore for evidence of exposure to PRV3M (also known as Melaka virus), which was first isolated from human patients in Melaka, Malaysia. We found that 67 serum samples were PRV3M positive by ELISA and 34 were also positive by virus neutralization assay. To investigate whether monkeys could act as hosts for PRV transmission, we experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques with PRV3M and housed these animals with uninfected monkeys. Although no clinical signs of infection were observed in infected animals, viral RNA was detected in nasal and rectal swabs and all infected macaques seroconverted. Additionally, one of the uninfected animals seroconverted, implying active shedding and transmission of PRV3M. We provide evidence that PRV exposure in the macaque population in Singapore occurs at a relatively high prevalence and this study suggests that cynomolgus macaques may be an intermediate or reservoir host for PRVs.","Tan, Chee Wah; Wittwer, Kevin; Lim, Xiao Fang; Uehara, Anna; Mani, Shailendra; Wang, Lin-Fa; Anderson, Danielle E.",Emerg Microbes Infect,365,1

Mice were bred as the genetically heterogeneous progeny of a cross between CB6F1 mothers and C3D2F1 fathers. Half of the mice were fed ad libitum (AL group), and the other half were subjected to 60% calorie restriction (CR group). Each mouse was tested at about 9 months of age using age-sensitive tests of immune status, and then again at about 12 months of age using age-sensitive tests of muscle function. The data were then analyzed using the method of partial least squares to determine the combinations of test weights that maximize the covariance of the weighted sum of immune measures with the weighted sum of muscle function measures. Both AL and CR mice exhibited a statistically significant relation between the immune status tests and the muscle function tests. Maximal covariance was obtained with a set of weighting coefficients consistent with our working hypothesis: mice with high levels of CD4 memory T cells (which increase with age) also had relatively low levels of muscle strength and endurance. Low strength was associated with low CD8 cells in the AL mice, with high numbers of CD8 memory cells in the CR mice and with low CD3 cells in both diet groups. The partial least squares method generates composite indices of immune status and muscle function that can be evaluated as biomarkers of aging rate in these mice. Further work will be needed to assess whether these tests predict either longevity or the trajectory of change in other age-sensitive molecular and physiological traits.","Miller, Richard A.; Bookstein, Fred; Van der Meulen, Jack; Engle, Sasha; Kim, Julie; Mullins, Lisa; Faulkner, John",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,365,22

PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from dopaminergic neuronal cell loss in the mid-brain substantia nigra pars compacta region. Outlined here is an integrative medicine and health strategy that highlights five treatment options for people with Parkinson’s (PwP): rehabilitate, therapy, restorative, maintenance, and surgery. Rehabilitating begins following the diagnosis and throughout any additional treatment processes, especially vis-à-vis consulting with physical, occupational, and/or speech pathology therapist(s). Therapy uses daily administration of either the dopamine precursor levodopa (with carbidopa) or a dopamine agonist, compounds that preserve residual dopamine, and other specific motor/non-motor-related compounds. Restorative uses strenuous aerobic exercise programs that can be neuroprotective. Maintenance uses complementary and alternative medicine substances that potentially support and protect the brain microenvironment. Finally, surgery, including deep brain stimulation, is pursued when PwP fail to respond positively to other treatment options. There is currently no cure for PD. In conclusion, the best strategy for treating PD is to hope to slow disorder progression and strive to achieve stability with neuroprotection. The ultimate goal of any management program is to improve the quality-of-life for a person with Parkinson’s disease.","Church, Frank C.",Biomolecules,365,8

By modelling, on one hand, cognitive distance as noise, and, on the other hand, the inefficiencies linked to a bad flow of information as costs, we propose a model of the dynamics by which a horizontal network evolves into a hierarchical network, with some members emerging as intermediaries in the transfer of knowledge between seekers and problem-solvers. Our theoretical model contributes to the understanding of the evolution of an innovation system by explaining how the increased complexity of the system can be thermodynamically justified by purely internal factors. Complementing previous studies, we demonstrate mathematically that the complexity of an innovation system can increase not only to address the complexity of the problems that the system has to solve, but also to improve the performance of the system in transferring the knowledge needed to find a solution.","Achermann, Guillem; De Luca, Gabriele; Simoni, Michele",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,365,1
39972,39972,39972,Graphical Abstract Contents Continued,9.330566,7.188535,2020-10-15,"Sepsis was first described by the ancient Greek physicians over 2000 years ago. The pathophysiology of the disease, however, is still not fully understood and hence the mortality rate is still unacceptably high due to lack of specific therapies. In the last decade, great progress has been made by shifting the focus of research from systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Sepsis has been re-defined as infection-induced MODS in 2016. How infection leads to MODS is not clear, but what mediates MODS becomes the major topic in understanding the molecular mechanisms and developing specific therapies. Recently, the mechanism of infection-induced extensive immune cell death which releases a large quantity of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and their roles in the development of MODS as well as immunosuppression during sepsis have attracted much attention. Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that DAMPs, including high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and histones as well as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), may directly or indirectly contribute significantly to the development of MODS. Here, we provide an overview of the mechanisms and consequences of infection-induced extensive immune cell death during the development of sepsis. We also propose a pivotal pathway from a local infection to eventual sepsis and a potential combined therapeutic strategy for targeting sepsis.","Cheng, Zhenxing; Abrams, Simon T.; Toh, Julien; Wang, Susan Siyu; Wang, Zhi; Yu, Qian; Yu, Weiping; Toh, Cheng-Hock; Wang, Guozheng",Front Immunol,365,1

Urology Virtual clinics (VCs) were initiated at our institution to ensure continued provision of service during the pandemic. The study aim was to analyse outcomes and cost-effectiveness of VCs compared to pre-COVID-19 face-to face (F2F) clinics. METHOD: We retrospectively analysed the VCs from 18(th) March 2020 to 1st July 2020 and compared them to F2F clinics in the same period in 2019. Clinical outcomes were compared, and potential financial savings were estimated to see if VCs can be incorporated into future practice. RESULTS: 1317 patients were reviewed in 2020 as compared to 1941 in 2019. We noted similar rates of discharges [25.4% (2020) v/s 24.1% (2019)], follow-ups (48.7% (2020) v/s 48.4% (2019)] and patients who did not attend/answer (6.8% (2020) v/s 6.6% (2019)]. Potentially, over £100,000 can be saved by changing 50% appointments to VCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows that VCs are non-inferior to F2F clinics and have allowed continued effective service provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is potential to incorporate VCs into future practice without compromising on efficacy. Further data collection and analysis is ongoing at our institution on a larger scale.","Hassanzadeh-Baboli, D; Pavithran, A; Khawaja, I; Maan, Z; Deshpande, A",Br J Surg,365,33

The threats facing young people in housing crisis are many, and their potential impacts, harrowing. Youth are at high risk for physical and sexual victimization, mental and physical illness, and involvement with the criminal legal system and face serious threats to their education, their future economic stability, and their lives. Despite these dangerous consequences, the response to this issue in the United States continues to lack urgency, meaningful investment, and empirical support. This article critically examines the current approach to services for youth in situations of homelessness in the United States. Directly informed by the lived experiences of young people, it calls for a shift in understanding of the nature and scope of the problem and, consequently, the practice and policy strategies being implemented to address it.

Gallium 68 can be made available either from onsite cyclotron production or in the form of ready-to-use (68)Ge/(68)Ga generators. Wherein setting up and running of cyclotron amounts to huge investment and dedicated team, the (68)Ge/(68)Ga generator has proved to be a better option and viable project. Moreover, due to long half-life of (68)Ge, i.e. 271 days, it enables the usage of generator for several months. The preparation of gallium-labeled peptides is much simpler in comparison to 18F radiochemistry, but the radiation exposure has always been an area of concern owing to high-energy annihilation photon of 511 keV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we share our experience of self-installation of (68)Ge/(68)Ga generator during lockdown and the various steps involved in installation of fully automated peptide-labeling system in customized mini hot cell module, synthesis steps, and quality control steps of gallium-based radiopharmaceutical. RESULTS: The installation was successfully completed with online assistance during the pandemic situation. The average elution yield met company specification (>80%), and (68)Ga-labeled peptides were prepared with high radiochemical purity (>95%). The overall exposure in single batch of production and quality control never exceeded 3 μSv as shielding was well-taken care of with customized mini hot cell.

To improve immunization against the persistent health challenge of Mtb infection, we have studied the CD8+ T cell response to Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and recombinant BCG (rBCG) in mice. Here, we generated CD8+ T cells with an rBCG-based vaccine encoding the Ag85B protein of M. kansasii, termed rBCG-Mkan85B, followed by boosting with plasmid DNA expressing the Ag85B gene (DNA-Mkan85B). We identified two MHC-I (H2-Kd )-restricted epitopes that induce cross-reactive responses to Mtb and other related mycobacteria in both BALB/c (H2d ) and CB6F1 (H2b/d ) mice. The H2-Kd -restricted peptide epitopes elicited polyfunctional CD8+ T cell responses that were also highly cross-reactive with those of other proteins of the Ag85 complex. Tetramer staining indicated that the two H2-Kd -restricted epitopes elicit distinct CD8+ T cell populations, a result explained by the X-ray structure of the two peptide/H2-Kd complexes. These results suggest that rBCG-Mkan85B vector-based immunization and DNA-Mkan85B boost may enhance CD8+ T cell response to Mtb, and might help to overcome the limited effectiveness of the current BCG in eliciting tuberculosis immunity.","Komine-Aizawa, Shihoko; Jiang, Jiansheng; Mizuno, Satoru; Hayakawa, Satoshi; Matsuo, Kazuhiro; Boyd, Lisa F; Margulies, David H; Honda, Mitsuo",European journal of immunology,365,24

Prioritization is normally guided by disease burden, but the highly age-dependent nature of COVID-19 and that of other infectious diseases make comparisons challenging unless considered through metrics that incorporate life-years lost and time lived with adverse health. Therefore, we compared the 2020 mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost estimates for malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan African populations with more than 12 months of COVID-19 burden (until the end of March 2021) by applying known age-related mortality to United Nations estimates of the age structure. We further compared exacerbations of disease burden predicted from the COVID-19 public health response. Data were derived from public sources and predicted exacerbations were derived from those published by international agencies. For sub-Saharan African populations north of South Africa, the estimated recorded COVID-19 DALYs lost in 2020 were 3.7%, 2.3%, and 2.4% for tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria, respectively. Predicted exacerbations of these diseases were greater than the estimated COVID-19 burden. Including South Africa and Lesotho, COVID-19 DALYs lost were < 12% of those for other compared diseases; furthermore, the mortality of compared diseases were dominated in all age groups younger than 65 years. This analysis suggests the relatively low impact of COVID-19. Although all four epidemics continue, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria remain far greater health priorities based on their disease burdens. Therefore, resource diversion to COVID-19 poses a high risk of increasing the overall disease burden and causing net harm, thereby further increasing global inequities in health and life expectancy.","Bell, David; Schultz Hansen, Kristian",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,365,16

Neoadjuvant or perioperative strategies dominate in Western countries, and docetaxel has recently shown significant survival benefits when combined with other standard regimens in advanced cancer and perioperative settings. PATIENTS AND METHODS This randomized phase III study was designed to prove the superiority of postoperative S-1 plus docetaxel over S-1 alone for R0 resection of pathologic stage III gastric cancer. The sample size of 1,100 patients was necessary to detect a 7% increase in 3-year relapse-free survival as the primary end point (hazard ratio, 0.78; 2-sided α = .05; β = .2). RESULTS The second interim analysis was conducted when the number of events reached 216 among 915 enrolled patients (median follow-up, 12.5 months). Analysis demonstrated the superiority of S-1 plus docetaxel (66%) to S-1 (50%) for 3-year relapse-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.632; 99.99% CI, 0.400 to 0.998; stratified log-rank test, P < .001), and enrollment was terminated as recommended by the independent data and safety monitoring committee. Incidences of grade 3 or greater adverse events, particularly neutropenia and leukopenia, were higher in the S-1 plus docetaxel group, but all events were manageable. CONCLUSION Addition of docetaxel to S-1 is effective with few safety concerns in patients with stage III gastric cancer. The present findings may also be applicable in countries in which perioperative adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation is not standard.","Yoshida, Kazuhiro; Kodera, Yasuhiro; Kochi, Mitsugu; Ichikawa, Wataru; Kakeji, Yoshihiro; Sano, Takeshi; Nagao, Narutoshi; Takahashi, Masazumi; Takagane, Akinori; Watanabe, Takuya; Kaji, Masahide; Okitsu, Hiroshi; Nomura, Takashi; Matsui, Takanori; Yoshikawa, Takaki; Matsuyama, Jin; Yamada, Makoto; Ito, Seiji; Takeuchi, Masahiro; Fujii, Masashi",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,365,31

Ibuprofen on an ""around-the-clock"" basis has been suggested to control postoperative pain sufficiently. Therefore, we established a standard scheme with weight-adapted recommended maximum ibuprofen dose. A reliable assessment of pain intensity can be performed with the Children's and Infants' Postoperative Pain Scale (CHIPPS) in children < 5 years, or with the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) in children aged ≥ 5 years. The Parents' Postoperative Pain Measure (PPPM-D) may be a useful tool for both age groups. We hypothesized that not more than 30% of the children would need an opioid rescue medication during their in-hospital stay and analyzed the consistency of the PPPM-D with other pain scales. METHODS We included 158 in-patients aged 2-12 years. Ibuprofen was orally administered every 8 h. Three times daily, pain scores were assessed by CHIPPS or FPS-R, respectively. The PPPM-D was used in all children. Exceeding the cut-off value in one of the tools was regarded as relevant pain. RESULTS A rescue medication was needed in 82.1% of children after tonsillectomy and 51.3% of children after tonsillotomy (P < 0.001). The cut-off value for relevant pain was mostly exceeded in the PPPM-D, but its overall concordance to the reference scales was low. CONCLUSION High-dose ibuprofen ""around-the-clock"" is insufficient to control pain in children after tonsil surgery. Research is needed to find an optimal schema for management and assessment of postoperative pain.","Gude, Philipp; Gustedt, Franziska; Bellgardt, Martin; Vogelsang, Heike; Herzog-Niescery, Jennifer; Dazert, Stefan; Weber, Thomas Peter; Volkenstein, Stefan",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,365,16

In this meta-analysis, we identified nine retrospective cohort studies that met inclusion criteria. Anticoagulation did not increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage in brain metastasis. In the setting of glioma, anticoagulation resulted in 3.8-fold increase in intracranial hemorrhage. SUMMARY Background Venous thromboembolism commonly occurs in patients with brain tumors. Because of the high rate of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), the safety of therapeutic anticoagulation is commonly questioned. Objective We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate whether therapeutic anticoagulation is associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with brain tumors. Patients/Methods A systematic literature search strategy was conducted. Summary statistics for ICH were obtained by calculating the odds ratio using a random effects model and heterogeneity across studies was estimated by the I(2) statistic. Results A total of nine retrospective cohort studies met the criteria for inclusion. The odds ratio (OR) for ICH in patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation versus those who did not receive anticoagulation was 2.13 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-4.56; I(2) = 46%). In studies evaluating anticoagulation in patients with brain metastases, there was no apparent increased risk of ICH (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.61-1.88; I(2) = 0%). However, in patients with glioma there was an increase in risk of ICH associated with the administration of anticoagulation (OR, 3.75; 95% CI, 1.42-9.95; I(2) = 33%). Conclusions The risk of ICH in patients with brain tumors receiving therapeutic anticoagulation depends on the diagnosis of primary or metastatic brain tumors. Although anticoagulation was not associated with an increased risk of ICH in the setting of brain metastasis, its use resulted in a greater than 3-fold increased risk of ICH in patients with glioma.","Zwicker, J I; Karp Leaf, R; Carrier, M",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,365,1

Studying the factors predictive of low-incidence complications requires the analysis of large cohorts. The Bariatric Outcomes Longitudinal Database, the world's largest prospective database for bariatric surgery, has provided a suitable medium for analyzing low-frequency events. METHODS The data in the Bariatric Outcomes Longitudinal Database from 73,921 research-consented patients who had undergone bariatric surgery by a participant in the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Bariatric Surgery Center of Excellence program before September 22, 2009, were analyzed for VTE events within 90 days after surgery. RESULTS The overall risk of VTE within 90 days after surgery was .42%, and 73% of these events occurred after discharge, most within 30 days after surgery. The risk of VTE was greater in the patients undergoing gastric bypass than in those undergoing adjustable gastric banding (.55% versus .16%). VTE was more frequent when the procedure was performed using an open than a laparoscopic approach (1.54% versus .34%). Patients with a VTE event were older (+4.9 yr), had had a greater preoperative body mass index (+3.9 kg/m(2)), and were more likely to have a history of VTE (16.5% versus 3.7%). The risk of VTE was greater in men (hazard ratio 2.32, 95% confidence interval 1.81-2.98) and in patients with an inferior vena cava filter (hazard ratio 7.66, 95% confidence interval 4.55-12.91). CONCLUSION The overall risk of VTE was low in the population treated by participants in the Bariatric Surgery Center of Excellence program, where clinical pathways to prevent VTE have been mandated. Analysis of this large study population allowed the identification of patient characteristics correlating with increased risk of postoperative VTE and the variable effectiveness of VTE prophylaxis methods.","Winegar, Deborah A; Sherif, Bintu; Pate, Virginia; DeMaria, Eric J",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,365,16

This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nonanesthesiologist-administered propofol (NAAP) sedation with a target-controlled infusion (TCI) system in elderly patients during ERCP. METHODS This study retrospectively analyzed 482 patients who underwent ERCP under propofol sedation with a TCI system at Iwakuni Medical Center between January 2014 and October 2016. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to their age: Group A, <70 years (n=130); Group B, ≥70 and <85 years (n=224); and Group C, ≥85 years (n=125). We compared the propofol dose and AEs during ERCP. RESULTS The median total infusion dose and minimum and maximum target blood concentrations of propofol were 336 mg, 2.2 μg/mL, and 2.2 μg/mL in Group A, 184 mg, 1.0 μg/mL, and 1.4 μg/mL in Group B, and 99 mg, 0.6 μg/mL, and 1.0 μg/mL in Group C, respectively, with older groups requiring a lower dose (p<0.0001). Hypotension was observed in 23 patients (4.8%), with no significant difference between the groups (Group A: 2.3%; Group B: 6.3%; Group C: 4.8%; p=0.24). Hypoxemia was observed in 16 patients (3.3%), with no significant difference between the groups (Group A: 3.1%; Group B: 4.9%; Group C: 0.8%; p=0.17). All AEs were immediately resolved, and no procedures were aborted. CONCLUSION NAAP sedation with a TCI system during ERCP may be acceptable in elderly patients with a lower dose of propofol than that used in younger patients.","Ogawa, Taiji; Tomoda, Takeshi; Kato, Hironari; Akimoto, Yutaka; Tanaka, Shoichi; Okada, Hiroyuki",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,365,1

We compared myocardial (18)F-FDG uptake in patients randomized to LC, HFLC, and unrestricted (UR) preparations prior to (18)F-FDG-PET. METHODS AND RESULTS We randomized 63 outpatients referred for oncologic (18)F-FDG-PET to LC, HFLC, or UR dietary preparations (1:1:1 allocation) starting the evening before PET. After eating dinner according to instructions, UR and LC patients fasted until FDG injection (mean time 745 minutes for UR, 899 minutes for LC), and HFLC patients drank a fatty drink 60-70 minutes prior to FDG injection. Attenuation-corrected PET imaging was performed 60 minutes after FDG administration. Maximal myocardial standard uptake values (MyoSUV(max)) were systematically measured in axial view and compared between the three groups. Using UR patients as reference, mean MyoSUV(max) was lower in LC patients (3.3 +/- 2.7 vs 6.2 +/- 5.2, P = .03) but not in HFLC patients (5.5 +/- 4.2, P = .63). Ratios of MyoSUV(max) to liver SUV(max), calculated to control for background uptake, were not significantly different amongst the groups (1.9 +/- 2.1 LC, 2.6 +/- 2.3 HFLC, 3.6 +/- 3.5 UR). CONCLUSION In this small randomized controlled trial using UR diet as reference, LC dietary preparation followed by extended fasting resulted in significant myocardial uptake suppression.","Cheng, Victor Y; Slomka, Piotr J; Ahlen, Marie; Thomson, Louise E J; Waxman, Alan D; Berman, Daniel S",Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology,365,33

The morphometric features of the normal cerebellum in guinea pigs have not been previously investigated using stereology. The objective of the present work was to establish normal volumetric and quantitative stereological parameters for cerebellar tissues in guinea pigs, by means of unbiased design-based stereology. Cerebellar total volume, gray and white matter volume fractions, molecular and granular layers volume fractions, cerebellar surface area, Purkinje cellular and nuclear volumes, and the Purkinje cell total count were stereologically estimated. For this purpose, cerebellar hemispheres from six adult male guinea pigs were employed. Isotropic, uniform random sections were obtained by applying the orientator method, and subsequently processed for light microscopy. The cerebellar total volume, the white and grey matter volume fractions, and the molecular and granular layer volumes were estimated using the Cavalieri's principle and the point counting system. The cerebellar surface area was estimated through the use of test lines; Purkinje cellular and nuclear volumes were analysed using the nucleator technique, whereas the Purkinje cell total count was obtained by means of the optical disector technique. The mean ± standard deviation total volume of a guinea-pig cerebellar hemisphere was 0.11 ± 0.01 cm3 . The mean volumetric proportions occupied by the gray and white matters were, respectively, 78.0 ± 2.6% and 22.0 ± 2.6%, whereas their mean absolute volumes were found to be 0.21 ± 0.02 cm3 and 0.059 ± 0.006 cm3 . The volumes of the molecular and granular layers were estimated at 112.4 ± 20.6 mm3 and 104.4 ± 7.3 mm3 , whereas their mean thicknesses were calculated to be 0.184 ± 0.020 mm and 0.17 ± 0.02 mm. The molecular and granular layers accounted for 40.7 ± 3.9% and 37.4 ± 1.8% of total cerebellar volume respectively. The surface area of the cerebellum measured 611.4 ± 96.8 mm2 . Purkinje cells with a cellular volume of 3210.1 µm3 and with a nuclear volume of 470.9 µm3 had a higher incidence of occurrence. The mean total number of Purkinje cells for a cerebellar hemisphere was calculated to be 253,090 ± 34,754. The morphometric data emerging from the present study provide a set of reference data which might prove valuable as basic anatomical contribution for practical applications in veterinary neurology.","De Silva, Margherita; Sadeghinezhad, Javad; Nyengaard, Jens R; Aghabalazadeh Asl, Mahdi; Saeidi, Ava; De Sordi, Nadia; Chiocchetti, Roberto; Grandis, Annamaria",Journal of anatomy,365,17

We describe a case where an operating room fire occurred while using high-flow nasal oxygen during an awake tracheostomy for an obese patient in airway extremis due to supraglottitis. Shortly after the operation began, and before incision of the trachea, electrical diathermy applied to bleeding sub-cutaneous vessels ignited a small flame. This was extinguished without harm to the patient and the procedure was completed without further complication. Fire requires three components: fuel; heat; and an oxidiser. We speculate that high-flow oxygen channelled under the drapes and acted as the oxidiser; either tissue eschar or vapourised fat were the fuel; and the diathermy supplied a source of ignition to complete the fire triad. When using high flows of concentrated oxygen, practitioners should aim to minimise all of these factors and be alert for the risk of fire at every stage of the operation.","Adams, T R P; Ricciardelli, A",Anaesthesia reports,365,16

The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was recently identified as the causative agent of a severe pneumonia. Given the ability of coronavirus to rapidly adapt to new hosts, a major public health concern is that MERS-CoV will further adapt to replication in humans, triggering a pandemic. No small-animal model for this infection is currently available, but studies suggest that virus entry factors can confer virus susceptibility. Here, we show that mice were sensitized to MERS-CoV infection by prior transduction with adenoviral vectors expressing the human host-cell receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4. Mice developed a pneumonia characterized by extensive inflammatory-cell infiltration with virus clearance occurring 6-8 d after infection. Clinical disease and histopathological changes were more severe in the absence of type-I IFN signaling whereas the T-cell response was required for virus clearance. Using these mice, we demonstrated the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention (poly I:C) and a potential vaccine [Venezuelan equine encephalitis replicon particles expressing MERS-CoV spike protein]. We also found little protective cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV.

To synthesize the evidence on self-compassion in hospice and palliative care patients, their relatives, and health care professionals, we conducted a systematic integrative review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement. For patients, self-compassion was associated with reduced stress, anxiety, shame, depressive symptoms, fear of cancer recurrence, and loneliness. It was also associated with increased social capital, self-soothing, mindfulness, compassion, causal reasoning ability, psychosocial and spiritual well-being, legacy, courage, and commitment. For health care professionals, self-compassion was associated with increased capacity for self-care, mindfulness, and professional quality of life and a decrease in perceived burnout risk and secondary traumatic stress. No studies were found to involve patients' relatives. Self-compassion seems to be an important resource in hospice and palliative care.

We estimated the burden and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 over the two waves. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study during July 2020-March 2021 in one rural and one urban community. Mid-turbinate nasal swabs were collected twice-weekly from consenting household members irrespective of symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Serum was collected every two months and tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Household cumulative infection risk (HCIR) was defined as the proportion of household members with infection following SARS-CoV-2 introduction. Findings Among 71,759 nasal specimens from 1,189 members (follow-up rate 93%), 834 (1%) were SARS-CoV-2-positive. By PCR detection and serology combined, 34% (406/1189) of individuals experienced [≥]1 SARS-CoV-2 infection episode, and 3% (12/406) experienced reinfection.

On multivariable analysis, index case lower cycle threshold value (OR 5.8, 95% CI 1.8-19.1), urban community (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.2) and infection with Beta variant (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.6-8.4) were associated with increased HCIR. HCIR was similar for symptomatic (8/67,12%) and asymptomatic (61/373, 16%) index cases (p-0.302). Interpretation In this study, 83% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were asymptomatic and index case symptom status did not affect HCIR, suggesting a limited role for control measures targeting symptomatic individuals. Previous infection was protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the second wave although household transmission increased following the emergence of Beta variant.

In pythons, nidovirus infection induces an inflammation of the upper respiratory and alimentary tract which can develop into a severe and often fatal proliferative pneumonia. We observed pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic lesions in organ systems other than the respiratory tract during full post mortem examinations on 30 nidovirus RT-PCR positive pythons of varying species originating from Switzerland and Spain. The observations prompted us to study whether the atypical tissue tropism associates with previously unknown nidoviruses or changes in the nidovirus genome. RT-PCR and inoculation of Morelia viridis cell cultures served to recruit the cases and to obtain virus isolates. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining against nidovirus nucleoprotein demonstrated that the virus not only infects a broad spectrum of epithelial (respiratory and alimentary epithelium, hepatocytes, renal tubules, pancreatic ducts etc.), but also intravascular monocytes, intralesional macrophages and endothelial cells. By next-generation sequencing we obtained full length genome for a novel nidovirus species circulating in Switzerland. Analysis of viral genomes recovered from pythons showing nidovirus infection-associated respiratory or systemic disease did not explain the observed phenotypes. The results indicate that python nidoviruses have a broad cell and tissue tropism, further suggesting that the course of infection could vary and involve lesions in a broad spectrum of tissues and organ systems as a consequence of monocyte-mediated systemic spread of the virus. IMPORTANCE During the last years, python nidoviruses have become a primary cause of fatal disease in pythons. Nidoviruses represent a threat to captive snake collections, as they spread rapidly and can be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our study indicates that, different from previously evidence, the viruses do not only affect the respiratory tract, but can spread in the entire body with blood monocytes, have a broad spectrum of target cells, and can induce a variety of lesions. Nidovirales is an order of animal and human viruses that compromise important zoonotic pathogens such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, as well as the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. Python nidoviruses belong to the same subfamily as the mentioned human viruses and show similar characteristics (rapid spread, respiratory and gastrointestinal tropism, etc.). The present study confirms the relevance of natural animal diseases to better understand the complexity of viruses of the order nidovirales.","Dervas, Eva; Hepojoki, Jussi; Smura, Teemu; Prähauser, Barbara; Windbichler, Katharina; Blümich, Sandra; Ramis, Antonio; Hetzel, Udo; Kipar, Anja",bioRxiv,365,24

The model is based on the SAIR compartmental model and includes mobility data terms that model the flow of people between different regions. The aim of the model is to analyze the influence of mobility on the evolution of a disease after a lockdown period and to study the appearance of small epidemic outbreaks due to the so-called imported cases. We apply the model to the simulation of the COVID-19 in the various areas of Spain, for which the authorities made available mobility data based on the position of cell phones. We also introduce a method for the estimation of incomplete mobility data. Some numerical experiments show the importance of data completion and indicate that the model is able to qualitatively simulate the spread tendencies of small outbreaks.

We base our research on an analysis of 427 web pages from 234 organisations that present information on security threats and relevant cyber security advice. The results show that users searching online for information are subject to an enormous range of advice and news from various sources with differing levels of credibility and relevance.

As globalization heightens the risk that remote communities with high STH prevalence will encounter novel pathogens, understanding how STHs shape immune responses to these downstream infections becomes increasingly crucial. Methodology We worked with Tsimane forager-horticulturalists in the Bolivian Amazon, where STHs are prevalent. We tested whether STHs and eosinophil levels—most likely indicative of infection in this population—are associated with dampened immune responses to in vitro stimulation with H1N1 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigens. Whole blood samples (n = 179) were treated with H1N1 vaccine and LPS and assayed for 13 cytokines (interferon gamma [INF-γ], interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α]). We evaluated how STHs and eosinophil levels affected cytokine responses and T helper (Th) 1 and Th2-cytokine suite responses to stimulation. Results Infection with Ascaris lumbricoides was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) associated with lower response of some cytokines to H1N1 and LPS in women. Eosinophils were significantly negatively associated with some cytokine responses to H1N1 and LPS, with the strongest effects in women, and associated with a reduced Th1- and Th2-cytokine response to H1N1 and LPS in women and men. Conclusions and implications We find that STHs were associated with dampened cytokine responses to certain viral and bacterial antigens, and suggest that this mitigation of host-induced damage may reduce the incidence of cytokine storms in populations with high STH prevalence.","Schneider-Crease, India; Blackwell, Aaron D.; Kraft, Thomas S.; Thompson, Melissa Emery; Suarez, Ivan Maldonado; Cummings, Daniel K.; Stieglitz, Jonathan; Snyder-Mackler, Noah; Gurven, Michael; Kaplan, Hillard; Trumble, Benjamin C.",bioRxiv,365,16

Each of the short tales, told by a sociologist, introduces topics and research methods using an engaging storyline. The opening story narrates how the sociologist uses participant observation to understand the work of a commercial pilot, and how he feels about autopilot systems replacing his job of flying aeroplanes. Other tales feature topics such as education, health, crime, and gender. There is also a chapter on ‘lockdown’ during the Covid-19 pandemic. One main feature of the book is the ‘back door’ approach to teaching research methods, with chapters dedicated to exploring statistics, sampling, visual methods, documents, embodied methods, autoethnographic research and ethics. Traditional textbooks in sociology focus on what novice sociologists should do, but few, if any, comprehensively deal with overcoming problems as they might emerge and explain what to do when things go wrong. The sociological tales written in this book provide examples of when field access is denied, research participants refuse to take part, and when recording equipment has broken down. Each tale raises issues and problems for the sociologist to overcome, such as research design flaws, sampling bias, lack of rapport with research participants, and the problems with breaking ethical codes of conduct. The book provides insight into the role of the sociologist, why sociology matters, and what happens when sociology fails us.

In this context, teachers are also experiencing new ways for updating their professional development. The metamorphosis of learning is currently being pushed by four main catalysts: the connectivity of networks, the empowerment of the students, the overcoming of space and time barriers, and the assumption of the existence of silent, unnoticed learning. But these uncertain times have added a new, recent catalyst for change in learning and education: the COVID-19 pandemic. In the framework of the ECO4LEARN research project, a study was designed and carried out to check to what extent the learning ecologies approach could provide information on how primary school teachers organise their learning and how they make decisions about it. A survey was sent to the entire population of primary school teachers in Catalonia, getting 1,253 answers. The calculated margin of error was +/- 3.14%. Data analysis was conducted along three steps: a) Descriptive statistics;b) Principal Component Analysis (PCA);and c) Multiple Regression. Results show that the learning ecologies approach proves to be useful for analysing the actual means teachers use for their professional development and updating. Although some teachers are more advanced, practices do not respond to what could be expected regarding the use of less formal training for teachers and its mediation through the use of technologies. Regarding the sample analysed, the digital dimension of teacher professional development practices is still in its inception. Some recommendations are provided.","Morer, A. S.; Raffaghelli, J.

We utilised modelling to study the impact of currently-available intervention methods on transmission across the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) - which accounts for [~] 70% of global burden - and highlight regions requiring intensified interventions. A model previously fitted to case data in DRC was used to predict cases and new infections under four future strategies in 168 health zones. The strategies comprise of medical interventions - active and passive screening (AS and PS) - and some include large-scale vector control (VC). In each health zone, we estimate the median year of EOT and the probability of EOT by 2030 under each and compute the least ambitious strategy predicted to achieve EOT by 2030. The model predicts 42 health zones are very likely to achieve EOT (> 90% probability) using medical-only strategies continued at mean coverage levels; this increases to 52 when AS coverage is increased to maximum previous coverage. In all VC strategies, health zones are predicted to meet EOT by 2030, although there are several where increasing low AS coverage could achieve this. This analysis provides a priority list for consideration for supplementary VC implementation (Bagata, Bandundu, Bolobo, Kikongo, Kwamouth and Masi Manimba in former Bandundu province) in conjunction with the recent AS coverage.","Huang, C.-I.; Crump, R.

Some but not all studies have suggested a possible weekend effect on mortality in different patient groups including patients suffering from heart failure. However, some studies failed to recognise admissions after 5pm on Fridays as weekend. We aim to determine in a large cohort of heart failure admissions whether patients are less likely to survive if admitted during weekend or Bank Holidays. Methods - A retrospective study of consecutive admissions with heart failure as 1st diagnostic position in Blackpool Victoria Hospital over an 18 month period from 1st August 2019 to 31st January 2021. Normal working hours is defined as 9am to 5pm during weekdays except UK Bank holidays. Results - Of 1178 episodes of heart failure admission, there were 140 inpatient deaths (11.9%). Median age at admission was 80 [interquartile range 70, 86]. 48 (4.1%) were COVID positive, 34% negative. 60.4% were not tested. 405 patients were admitted over the weekend/bank holiday (34.4%) . The other 773 patients (65.6%) were admitted during normal working hours (9am to 5pm during weekdays). The length of stay is not significantly different whether patients are admitted over weekend /bank holidays or during normal working hours {median 11 days [5, 19] vs 11 days [5,21] admitted during normal working hours, p=0.48}. Inpatient mortality in patients admitted with heart failure over the weekend/bank holiday was 1.3 times higher, but this apparent increased risk was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval of the odds ratio=0.98-1.8, Fisher exact 2-tailed p= 0.2). Conclusion There is no significant difference in inpatient mortality between patients admitted with heart failure during normal working hours or during weekends and bank holidays. Future research will explore reasons (including the use of evidence based drugs, timely diagnosis with echocardiography and the impact of COVID).","Awad, R.; Joseph, P.; Owen, E.; Khan, S.; Hilal-Babu, M.; Avinash, S.; Masudi, S.; Bahar, J.; Bennett, H.; Wong, K.; Rahman, A.",Heart,365,24

However, this concept has been neglected in previous studies. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from a sample of 600 respondents in two major Tunisian cities. Participants were selected on the basis of a convenience sampling in which the structural equation modelling method was adopted through SMART PLS 3.0 software. Findings The results showed that good corporate governance has a positive influence on the knowledge of the company's social responsibility, which positively influences its brand image. Therefore, the company's brand image positively influences the customer's satisfaction, which positively influences the recommending behaviour of the financial institutions in the COVID-19 era. However, the brand identification has no moderating effect. Practical implications Managers of financial institutions are advised to pay particular attention to good corporate governance, as it is mandatory for these companies to assume social responsibility and make it known to clients. Therefore, it is obvious to create a good image in the mind of the consumers to satisfy them to recommend the company in question. It is interesting to mobilise the period of health crisis (COVID-19) to create a favourable attitude among the customers because they are sensitive when evaluating and ranking financial institutions according to the relationships that exist especially during this period. Originality/value In fact, there are many studies that dealt with the banking sector. Some of them dealt with the sector through the institutional accounting section while others dealt with the sector through the commercial and marketing section. Therefore, the first contribution of this research is to test a mixed model made up of accounting and commercial data. This model is among the first to determine the effects of the financial institution's governance on the knowledge of social responsibility and on the consumer's attitude and behaviour to test the moderating role of brand identification in the banking sector. The second contribution is to test this model in a period of health crisis (COVID-19). The third contribution is the use of a mixed sample of data collected from two regions. Then, the fourth contribution is the addition of tests for the verification, robustness and validation of the results obtained.

While most multimorbidity research takes a cross-sectional approach, longitudinal approaches to understanding multimorbidity are an emerging research area. We aim to scope the methodological approaches and substantive findings of studies analysing multimorbidity trajectories. Methods: We identified studies employing longitudinal methodologies to explore multimorbidity trajectories using a scoping review approach. A systematically search for relevant studies was carried via four academic databases (Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase) complemented by professional networks and reference lists. Results: Our review identified 34 studies investigating multimorbidity longitudinally, all published in the last decade, and with a clear lack of research based on low- and middle-income country data. Longitudinal approaches included constructing variables of change, multilevel regression analysis (e.g. growth curve modelling), longitudinal group-based methodologies (e.g. latent class modelling), analysing disease transitions, and visualisation techniques. Commonly identified risk factors for multimorbidity onset and progression were older age, higher deprivation, overweight, and poorer health behaviours. Conclusion: The nascent research area employs a diverse range of longitudinal approaches that characterize accumulation and disease combinations, and to a lesser extent disease sequencing and progression. Understanding the life course determinants of different multimorbidity trajectories across diverse populations and settings can provide a detailed picture of morbidity development, with important implications from a clinical and intervention perspective.","Cezard, G.; McHale, C.; Sullivan, F.; Bowles, J.; Keenan, K.",,365,16

Materials and Methods: An economic model was developed to estimate the clinical benefits and costs for an average newly hospitalized COVID-19 patient, with a 28-day time horizon for the index hospitalization. Clinical outcomes from the LIVE-AIR trial included failure to achieve survival without ventilation (SWOV), mortality, time to recovery, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) use. Base case costs included drug acquisition and administration for lenzilumab and hospital resource costs based on the level of care required. The inclusion of 1-year rehospitalization costs was examined in a scenario analysis. Results: In the base case and all scenarios, treatment with lenzilumab plus SOC improved all specified clinical outcomes over SOC alone. Adding lenzilumab to SOC was also estimated to result in cost savings of $3,190 per patient in a population aged <85 years with CRP <150 mg/L and receiving remdesivir (base case). Per-patient cost savings were also estimated in the following scenarios: 1) aged <85 years with CRP <150 mg/L, with or without remdesivir ($1,858); 2) Black and African American patients with CRP <150 mg/L ($13,154); and 3) Black and African American patients from the full population ($2,763). In the full mITT population, a budget impact of $4,952 was estimated. When adding rehospitalization costs to the index hospitalization, a total per-patient cost savings of $5,154 was estimated. Conclusions: The results highlight the clinical benefits for SWOV, ventilator use, time to recovery, mortality, time in ICU, and time on IMV, in addition to a favorable budget impact from the United States hospital perspective associated with adding lenzilumab to SOC for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Kilcoyne, A.; Jordan, E.; Zhou, A.; Thomas, K.

In the last few months, a large number of our newly-diagnosed patients with melanoma, as well as those with non-melanoma skin cancers, reported that they had noticed a suspicious skin lesion a few months ago but decided not to seek help from dermatologist due to the worrisome epidemiologic situation. In the current environment, clinical skin examination may be viewed as less important and thus postponed, but neglecting melanoma throughout the virus outbreak may lead to increased rates of morbidity, mortality, and consequently a greater financial burden for the health system (1). There are several reasons for such a relaxed attitude towards skin health in our patients. Unlike cardiac, pulmonary, or digestive difficulties, which patients consider life-threatening and for which they seek emergency care despite the coronavirus pandemic, skin tumors do not cause great subjective or significantly noticeable objective symptoms. Moreover, all of the skin tumors and especially melanoma , mostly present as small changes of just a few millimeters in diameter in the early stage at which they are prognostically most favorable. For the average person with no medical education, such small lesions usually do not cause any concern as they have no awareness of the fact that small and inconspicuous skin lesions may be dangerous and potentially even lethal. According to the recommendations concerning patient management during COVID-19 pandemic, oncological examinations should still be performed regularly (2). In spite of that, the cancelation of appointments, especially by patients who are being monitored for high-risk lesions, is inevitable when COVID-19 is disrupting everyone's lives. With the pandemic evolving and no clear solutions in sight, now is the time to emphasize the importance of self-examination and teledermatology in early melanoma diagnosis. Even though diagnosing and managing pigmented skin lesions usually requires face-to-face examinations and dermoscopy as a crucial tool in early melanoma detection, in these times, and especially for people with a higher risk of SARS-COV2 infection, remote communication could prevent delays resulting in worse prognosis and could also eliminate the risk of infecting healthcare workers. Moreover, teledermatology can also be initiated by doctors asking patients to monitor lesions between clinical visits (3). However, we should not rely solely on this technology but should instead assess every patient individually and insist on a face-to-face examination for those at greater risk, with the aim that, if necessary, surgery be performed in timely manner. The collaboration between general practitioners and dermatologists represents an important aspect of achieving the most rational and effective health care in terms of performing triage of patients who can be assessed by teledermatology as well as referring to hospital centers those who need face-to-face examination and further treatment. During the first breakout of the epidemic in March 2020, the multidisciplinary team for melanoma from the Croatian National Referral Melanoma Centre provided recommendations for the management of patients with melanoma during COVID epidemic, designed according to the guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) (4) and considering the specifics of health care and clinical practice in the Republic of Croatia. Due to epidemic circumstances, preventive actions such as Euromelanoma and many other campaigns that included massive preventive skin examinations of the population and which were conducted for years by Croatian dermatologists throughout the country, could not be organized this year. This is particularly worrisome because on average about 800 patients are diagnosed with melanoma annually in Croatia, of which 60 during public health preventive actions. Despite these circumstances, we were able to maintain public awareness of the importance of early skin cancer recognition by sending the message through different media such as newspapers, television, and social media (Facebook and Instagram). We find that now more than ever it is essential to remind and teach the population about the importance of regular monthly skin self-examinations and recognition of atypical lesions. Clearly, a thorough dermatological examination includes full skin examination from head to toe. Herein we would also like to remind our readers that most skin cancers develop in the head and neck area, which is the most UV-exposed part of the body. Therefore, despite the epidemic conditions, the removal of patients' masks and thorough inspection of the face is mandatory. We find it most practical and efficient to perform the body and scalp examination first, followed by the face examination after the patient gets dressed. Prior to removal of the mask, we ask the patient not to talk during close examination. Even though this could make dermoscopic examination harder to perform, we strongly suggest wearing a protective shield and mask during close examination whenever possible. Between patients, the examining room should be disinfected and ventilated. As doctors, we live in uncertain times when we are heavily burdened by the currently unstoppable COVID epidemic, always awaiting new instructions from the state administration every day and wondering whether perhaps tomorrow we dermatologists will be assigned solely to the service of patients with COVID-19. In the end, we would like to once again remind you that despite the ravaging COVID pandemic and all the epidemiological measures that come with it, other diseases still exist. It is expected of us to draw attention to the still growing incidence of skin cancers and the serious consequences that can occur as a result of a delayed diagnosis.","Šitum, Mirna; Filipović, Nika; Buljan, Marija",Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica : ADC,365,17

The pioneering work on the ""Fetal Programming Hypothesis"" focused on pregnant women exposed to a great famine that occurred in the Netherlands at the end of World War II. The intrauterine environment of the babies during that famine caused them to low birthweight and determined the appearance of cardiovascular diseases in themselves when they reached adulthood, a risk that was transmitted even to the following generation. In addition to the general stress that a pregnant woman may suffer as a result of the death of a family member, suffering a war or natural disaster such as the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, there is another specific type of stress that refers exclusively to the pregnancy process; this is the pregnancy specific-stress. Pregnancy-specific stress is capable of sensitively predicting negative maternal and neonatal outcomes. This type of stress refers to the specific stress of pregnant women related to medical problems, the health of the newborn, the changes that the pregnancy will produce in their social relationships, prematurity, physical changes of pregnancy and fear of labor and birth. The objective of this article was to offer an updated information on pregnancy-specific stress and its consequences for maternal and neonatal health.

The primary outcome was 30-day major adverse event of combined mortality or severe morbidity, and the secondary outcome was 30-day new disability. Eleven patients (13.6%) suffered a major adverse event, and 28 patients (34.6%) experienced new disability. Room air cerebral tissue oxygen saturation was significantly different between patients who had a major adverse event, 67% (95% confidence interval [CI] 65-70) versus unaffected, 71% (95% CI 70-72; P=0.04).

Although there exist large datasets of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans, few COVID-19 image collections are currently available due to patient privacy. At the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant articles in the biomedical literature. Here, we present COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database of COVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically extracted from COVID-19-relevant articles from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset. We extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions in the article and separated compound figures into subfigures. We also designed a deep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classify them accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as of May 9, 2020) with their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of COVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies. (1) We show that COVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute to improved DL performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT. (2) We collected CT images of influenza and trained a DL baseline to distinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of diseases on CT. (3) We trained an unsupervised one-class classifier from non-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4) From text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared clinical symptoms and clinical findings of COVID-19 vs. those of influenza to demonstrate the disease differences in the scientific publications. We believe that our work is complementary to existing resources and hope that it will contribute to medical image analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sequence analysis of the remaining approximately 6.2 kb of the GAV genome downstream of ORF1a-1b to a 3'-poly(A) tail has identified two highly conserved intergenic sequences in which 29/32 nucleotides are conserved. Northern hybridization using probes to the four putative GAV ORFs and either total or poly(A)-selected RNA identified two 3'-coterminal subgenomic (sg) mRNAs of approximately 6 kb and approximately 5.5 kb. Primer extension and 5'-RACE analyses showed that the sgmRNAs initiate at the same 5'-AC positions in the central region of the two conserved intergenic sequences. Neither method provided any evidence that the GAV sgmRNAs are fused to genomic 5'-leader RNA sequences as is the case with vertebrate coronaviruses and arteriviruses. Intracellular double-stranded (ds)RNAs equivalent in size to the 26.2 kb genomic RNA and two sgRNAs were also identified by RNase/DNase digestion of total RNA from GAV-infected prawn tissue. The identification of only two sgmRNAs that initiate at the same position in conserved intergenic sequences and the absence of 5'-genomic leader sequences fused to these sgmRNAs confirms that GAV has few genes and suggests that it utilizes a transcription mechanism possibly similar to the vertebrate toroviruses but distinct from coronaviruses and arteriviruses.,"Cowley, Jeff A; Dimmock, Christine M; Walker, Peter J",The Journal of general virology,365,20

All RNAs associated with turnip crinkle virus (TCV), including the genomic RNA (4,054 bases) and satellite RNAs (sat-RNAs) such as sat-RNA D (194 bases), terminate with the motif CCUGCCC. While investigating the ability of in vivo-generated recombinants between sat-RNA D and TCV to be amplified in plants, we discovered that sat-RNA D, although truncated by as many as 15 bases in the chimeric molecules, was released from the chimeric transcripts and amplified to high levels. The ""new"" sat-RNA D molecules nearly all terminated with the motif (C1-2)UG(C1-3) (which may begin with 1 or 2 cytosines and end with 1, 2, or 3 cytosines), which was similar or identical to the natural sat-RNA D 3' end. The new sat-RNA D also contained between 1 and 22 bases of heterogeneous sequence upstream from the terminal motif, which, in some cases, was apparently derived from internal regions of either the plus or minus strand of the TCV genomic RNA. Since most of these internal genomic RNA sequences within TCV were not adjacent to (C1-2)UG(C1-3), at least two steps were required to produce new sat-RNA D 3' ends: nonhomologous recombination with the TCV genomic RNA followed by the addition or modification of the terminus to generate the (C1-2)UG(C1-3) motif.","Carpenter, C D; Simon, A E",Journal of virology,365,20

The analysis of these decrees can be used to make a first assessment of the implications of the COVID crisis on labour markets, and also to speculate on mid and long-term developments, since the most and least affected sectors are probably going to continue to operate differently until a vaccine or other long-term solution is found. Using an ad-hoc extraction of EU-LFS data, we apply this classification to the analysis of employment in Germany, Italy and Spain but also UK, Poland and Sweden, in order to cover the whole spectrum of institutional labour market settings within Europe. Our results, in line with recent literature, show that the employment impact is asymmetric within and between countries. In particular, the countries that are being hardest hit by the pandemic itself (Spain and Italy, and also the UK) are the countries more likely to suffer the worst employment implications of the confinement, because of their productive specialisation and labour market institutions. Indeed, these were also the labour markets that were more vulnerable before the crisis: characterised by high unemployment and precarious work (especially temporary contracts).","Fana, Marta; Torrejón Pérez, Sergio; Fernández-Macías, Enrique",J.

There are few studies which assessed standard electrocardiogram (ECG) as a prognostic tool during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study is to identify the relationship between of ECG parameters and prognosis of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHOD AND RESULTS: A total of 114 consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 2020 and May 2020 were included in the study. Standard 12­lead surface ECG was reviewed for presence of fragmented QRS (fQRS), abnormal Q wave, T wave inversion, and duration of QRS. fQRS was observed in 36.8% (n = 42) of the patients who had SARS-CoV-2. Patient groups with and without fQRS did not differ in terms of age, gender, the presence of comorbid diseases and medical treatment. Hospitalization duration, intensive care unit(ICU) requirement, all-cause mortality, and cardiac mortality were found to be higher in patients with fQRS (all p values <0.05). There was a positive correlation between QRS duration and duration of hospital stay (p < 0.001, r = 0.421). QRS duration was also found to be associated with intensive care need, all-cause mortality, and cardiac mortality. CONCLUSION: Our data shows that QRS duration and the presence of fQRS on standard ECG can help to identify patients with worse clinical outcome admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Yildirim, Arzu; Karaca, I Oguz; Yilmaz, Filiz Kizilirmak; Gunes, H Murat; Cakal, Beytullah",J Electrocardiol,365,1

It is challenging yet promising to automatically detect mental health problems from such data which is short, sparse and sometimes poorly phrased.

Specifically, we encode words in user posts using pre-trained word embeddings and BiGRUs to capture latent behavioural patterns, long-term dependencies, and correlation across the modalities, including semantic sequence features from the user timelines (posts). The CNN model then helps learn useful features. Our experiments show that our model outperforms several popular and strong baseline methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining deep learning with multi-modal features. We also show that our model helps improve predictive performance when detecting depression in users who are posting messages publicly on social media.","Zogan, Hamad; Wang, Xianzhi; Jameel, Shoaib; Xu, Guandong",,365,16

However, with a larger supply, if vaccination can occur while other interventions are maintained, the optimal strategy switches to targeting key transmitters to indirectly protect the vulnerable. As supply increases, vaccines that reduce or block infection have a greater impact than those that prevent disease alone due to the indirect protection provided to high-risk groups. Given a 2 billion global dose supply in 2021, we find that a strategy in which doses are allocated to countries proportional to population size is close to optimal in averting deaths and aligns with the ethical principles agreed in pandemic preparedness planning.","Hogan, Alexandra B; Winskill, Peter; Watson, Oliver J; Walker, Patrick G T; Whittaker, Charles; Baguelin, Marc; Brazeau, Nicholas F; Charles, Giovanni D; Gaythorpe, Katy A M; Hamlet, Arran; Knock, Edward; Laydon, Daniel J; Lees, John A; Løchen, Alessandra; Verity, Robert; Whittles, Lilith K; Muhib, Farzana; Hauck, Katharina; Ferguson, Neil M; Ghani, Azra C",Vaccine,365,20

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study to identify case subjects with COVID-19 across a regional health care network of 137 service locations. Using an electronic health record query, chart review, and patient contact, we identified clinical factors influencing illness severity. RESULTS: We identified COVID-19 in 6,138, 40, and 273 patients without diabetes and with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Compared with not having diabetes, people with type 1 diabetes had adjusted odds ratios of 3.90 (95% CI 1.75-8.69) for hospitalization and 3.35 (95% CI 1.53-7.33) for greater illness severity, which was similar to risk in type 2 diabetes. Among patients with type 1 diabetes, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), hypertension, race, recent diabetic ketoacidosis, health insurance status, and less diabetes technology use were significantly associated with illness severity. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes status, both type 1 and type 2, independently increases the adverse impacts of COVID-19. Potentially modifiable factors (e.g., HbA1c) had significant but modest impact compared with comparatively static factors (e.g., race and insurance) in type 1 diabetes, indicating an urgent and continued need to mitigate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection risk in this community.","Gregory, Justin M; Slaughter, James C; Duffus, Sara H; Smith, T Jordan; LeStourgeon, Lauren M; Jaser, Sarah S; McCoy, Allison B; Luther, James M; Giovannetti, Erin R; Boeder, Schafer; Pettus, Jeremy H; Moore, Daniel J",Diabetes care,365,4

Here, we examine the cichlid feeding apparatus, an icon of both prodigious evolutionary divergence and adaptive phenotypic plasticity. We first provide a tissue-level mechanism for plasticity in craniofacial shape by measuring rates of bone deposition within functionally salient elements of the feeding apparatus in fishes forced to employ alternate foraging modes. We show that levels and patterns of phenotypic plasticity are distinct among closely related cichlid species, underscoring the evolutionary potential of this trait. Next, we demonstrate that hedgehog (Hh) signaling, which has been implicated in the evolutionary divergence of cichlid feeding architecture, is associated with environmentally induced rates of bone deposition. Finally, to demonstrate that Hh levels are the cause of the plastic response and not simply the consequence of producing more bone, we use transgenic zebrafish in which Hh levels could be experimentally manipulated under different foraging conditions. Notably, we find that the ability to modulate bone deposition rates in different environments is dampened when Hh levels are reduced, whereas the sensitivity of bone deposition to different mechanical demands increases with elevated Hh levels. These data advance a mechanistic understanding of phenotypic plasticity in the teleost feeding apparatus and in doing so contribute key insights into the origins of adaptive morphological radiations.","Navon, Dina; Male, Ira; Tetrault, Emily R; Aaronson, Benjamin; Karlstrom, Rolf O; Albertson, R Craig",Proc.

METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Clinicaltrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the preprint server of medRxiv.org were searched from their inception to February 20, 2021. Only RCTs that compared the treatment efficacy and safety of tocilizumab with the placebo or the standard of care for adult patients with COVID-19 were included in this meta-analysis. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. RESULTS: This meta-analysis included eight RCTs which enrolled a total of 6314 patients for randomization, in which 3267 and 3047 patients were assigned to the tocilizumab and control groups, respectively. The mortality at day 28 was 24.4% and 29.9% in patients in the tocilizumab and control groups, respectively, meaning there was no significant difference observed between these two groups (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.66-1.28; I2 = 62). This finding did not change in the subgroup analysis according to the initial use of MV or steroid while enrollment. The patients receiving tocilizumab had a lower rate of mechanical ventilation (MV) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission at day 28 compared with the control group (MV use: OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.90; I2 = 11; ICU admission: OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.28-0.92; I2 = 30). There were no significant differences between these two treatment groups in terms of the risk of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.71-1.49; I2 = 43), serious AEs (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.67-1.12; I2 = 0) or infection (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.63-1.20; I2 = 0). CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab does not provide a survival benefit for patients with COVID-19, but it may help reduce the risk of MV and ICU admission.

Many health care regions in Canada have cancelled or limited surgical and non-surgical interventions on patients to preserve healthcare resources for a predicted increase in COVID19 related hospital admissions. Also reduced health interventions may limit the risk of possible transmission of COVID19 to other patients and health care workers during this pandemic. The majority of institutions in Canada have developed their own operational mandates regarding access to surgical resources for patients suffering from Head and Neck Cancers during this pandemic. There is a large degree of individual practitioner judgement in deciding access to care as well as resource allocation during these challenging times. The Canadian Association of Head and Neck Surgical Oncology (CAHNSO) convened a task force to develop a set of guidelines based on the best current available evidence to help Head and Neck Surgical Oncologists and all practitioners involved in the care of these patients to help guide individual practice decisions. MAIN BODY: The majority of head and neck surgical oncology from initial diagnosis and work up to surgical treatment and then follow-up involves aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMPs) which inherently put head and neck surgeons and practitioners at high risk for transmission of COVID19. The aggressive nature of the majority of head and neck cancer negates the ability for deferring surgical treatment for a prolonged period of time. The included guidelines provide recommendations for resource allocation for patients, use of personal protective equipment for practitioners as well as recommendations for modification of practice during the current pandemic. CONCLUSION: 1. Enhanced triaging should be used to identify patients with aggressive malignancies. These patients should be prioritized to reduce risk of significant disease progression in the reduced resource environment of COVID19 era. 2. Enhanced triaging including aggressive pre-treatment COVID19 testing should be used to identify patients with high risk of COVID19 transmission. 3. Enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) including N95 masks and full eye protection should be used for any AGMPs performed even in asymptomatic patients. 4. Enhanced PPE including full eye protection, N95 masks and/or powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) should be used for any AGMPs in symptomatic or presumptive positive COVID 19 patients.","O039,; Connell, Daniel A; Seikaly, Hadi; Isaac, Andre; Pyne, Justin; Hart, Robert D; Goldstein, David; Yoo, John",J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,365,1

We have integrated multiple different strategies into AICov, including the ability to use deep learning strategies based on LSTM and even modeling. To demonstrate our approach, we have conducted a pilot that integrates population covariates from multiple sources. Thus, AICov not only includes data on COVID-19 cases and deaths but, more importantly, the population's socioeconomic, health and behavioral risk factors at a local level. The compiled data are fed into AICov, and thus we obtain improved prediction by integration of the data to our model as compared to one that only uses case and death data.","Fox, Geoffrey C.; Laszewski, Gregor von; Wang, Fugang; Pyne, Saumyadipta",,365,20

In the Netherlands, 69 out of 127 mink farms were infected with SARS-CoV-2 between April and November 2020 and all mink on infected farms were culled after SARS-CoV-2 infection to prevent further spread of the virus. On some farms, (feral) cats and dogs were present. This study provides insight into the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-positive cats and dogs in 10 infected mink farms and their possible role in transmission of the virus. Throat and rectal swabs of 101 cats (12 domestic and 89 feral cats) and 13 dogs of 10 farms were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using PCR. Serological assays were performed on serum samples from 62 adult cats and all 13 dogs. Whole Genome Sequencing was performed on one cat sample. Cat-to-mink transmission parameters were estimated using data from all 10 farms. This study shows evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 12 feral cats and 2 dogs. Eleven cats (18%) and two dogs (15%) tested serologically positive. Three feral cats (3%) and one dog (8%) tested PCR-positive. The sequence generated from the cat throat swab clustered with mink sequences from the same farm. The calculated rate of mink-to-cat transmission showed that cats on average had a chance of 12% (95%CI 10%-18%) of becoming infected by mink, assuming no cat-to-cat transmission. As only feral cats were infected it is most likely that infections in cats were initiated by mink, not by humans. Whether both dogs were infected by mink or humans remains inconclusive. This study presents one of the first reports of interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 that does not involve humans, namely mink-to-cat transmission, which should also be considered as a potential risk for spread of SARS-CoV-2.","van Aart, Anna E; Velkers, Francisca C; Fischer, Egil A J; Broens, Els M; Egberink, Herman; Zhao, Shan; Engelsma, Marc; Hakze-van der Honing, Renate W; Harders, Frank; de Rooij, Myrna M T; Radstake, Carien; Meijer, Paola A; Oude Munnink, Bas B; de Rond, Jan; Sikkema, Reina S; van der Spek, Arco N; Spierenburg, Marcel; Wolters, Wendy J; Molenaar, Robert-Jan; Koopmans, Marion P G; van der Poel, Wim H M; Stegeman, Arjan; Smit, Lidwien A M",Transbound. emerg. dis.

A prospective cross-sectional study of 83 informal caregivers was included. The characteristics of informal caregivers as well as their QOL assessment by the Family Dermatology Life Quality Index (FDLQI) were measured, respectively. Single-factor analysis and multiple regression analysis were carried out to explore the independent influence factors of QOL of caregiver on caring for patient with chronic wound. 62.65% of the caregivers were female with a mean age of (54.24 ± 12.6) years, and 34.9% of the caregivers were parents. The mean FDLQI score was 13.01 ± 7.53 at a high level. The following variables influenced the FDLQI scores of caregivers: self-care ability of patients, patient's satisfaction of home-based wound care, and home-based wound care need of caregivers. The model was able to explain 29.9% of variance in QOL of caregiver (F = 6.561, P = .000, R2 = 0.299, adjusted R2 = 0.253). In conclusion, the impact of chronic wound disease on the QOL of caregivers is heavy during COVID-19 epidemic. Wound professionals are suggested to pay attention to wound care need at home and QOL of caregiver on caring for patients with chronic wound during COVID-19 epidemic and develop tailored wound health education and support programme in order to improve the QOL of caregivers.","Huang, Yao; Mao, Bei Qian; Ni, Peng Wen; Wang, Qi; Xie, Ting; Hou, Lili",Int Wound J,365,20

A worldwide effort was made to develop efficient vaccines for this disease. A vaccine should produce immune responses with specific and neutralizing antibodies, and without harmful effects such as the antibody-dependent enhancement that may be associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome. Vaccine design involves the selection of platforms that includes viral, viral-vector, protein, nucleic acid, or trained immunity-based strategies. Its development initiates at a pre-clinical stage, followed by clinical trials when successful. Only if clinical trials show no significant evidence of safety concerns, vaccines can be manufactured, stored, and distributed to immunize the population. So far, regulatory authorities from many countries have approved nine vaccines with phase 3 results. In the current pandemic, a paradigm for the COVID-19 vaccine development has arisen, as many challenges must be overcome. Mass-production and cold-chain storage to immunize large human populations should be feasible and fast, and a combination of different vaccines may boost logistics and immunization. In silico trials is an emerging and innovative field that can be applied to predict and simulate immune, molecular, clinical, and epidemiological outcomes of vaccines to refine, reduce, and partially replace steps in vaccine development. Vaccine-resistant variants of SARS-CoV-2 might emerge, leading to the necessity of updates. A globally fair vaccine distribution system must prevail over vaccine nationalism for the world to return to its pre-pandemic status.","Carneiro, Diego C; Sousa, Jéssica D; Monteiro-Cunha, Joana P",Virus Res,365,20

Data on this modality are primarily limited to small retrospective single-center series. OBJECTIVE: To assess safety and efficacy of this treatment by establishing an international, multicenter collaboration. METHODS: Consecutive posterior circulation aneurysms treated with the PED from 2012 to 2019 across 11 neurovascular centers were retrospectively reviewed. Baseline demographics, aneurysm and treatment characteristics, complications, occlusion status, and functional outcome were assessed. RESULTS: There were 149 posterior circulation aneurysms treated with PED in 146 patients. A total of 24 (16.4%) patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Most aneurysms were dissecting/blister (36.2%) in morphology, followed by saccular (35.6%) and fusiform (28.2%). The most common locations were the vertebral (51.7%) and basilar arteries (22.8%). Complete or near-complete occlusion (>90%) was achieved in 90.9% of aneurysms at a median follow-up of 12 mo. Dissecting/blister aneurysms were most likely to occlude (P = .06). Symptomatic neurologic complications occurred in 9.4% of aneurysms, associated with larger size, ruptured presentation, presentations with brain stem compression, cranial nerve palsy, or stroke. Favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Score 0-2) was achieved in 86.2% of patients. There were 6 fatalities of which 4 occurred in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. CONCLUSION: This multicenter study shows that PED for the treatment of posterior circulation is preferentially used for the treatment of fusiform and dissecting/blister aneurysm morphologies. Despite the challenges presented by these less-common morphologies, flow diversion may be performed with a neurologic complication rate of about 10% and favorable long-term aneurysm occlusion rates.","Griessenauer, Christoph J; Enriquez-Marulanda, Alejandro; Taussky, Philipp; Biswas, Arundhati; Grandhi, Ramesh; Xiang, Sissi; Hong, Tao; Rinaldo, Lorenzo; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Brinjikji, Waleed; Burkhardt, Jan-Karl; Kan, Peter; Ghuman, Mandeep; Yang, Victor X D; Chen, Karen; Aziz-Sultan, Mohammad A; Ghorbani, Mohammad; Schirmer, Clemens M; Goren, Oded; Dalal, Shamsher S; Killer-Oberpfalzer, Monika; Müller-Thies-Broussalis, Erasmia; Koch, Matthew J; Stapleton, Christopher J; Patel, Aman B; Foreman, Paul M; Cress, Marshall C; Hirschl, Robert A; Krings, Timo; Zhang, Hongqi; Dmytriw, Adam A",Neurosurgery,365,21

Here, we design constructs incorporating an N-terminal purification tag, a site-specific protease-cleavage site, the probe region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. Probe regions include full-length spike ectodomain as well as various subregions, and we also design mutants that eliminate recognition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Yields of biotin-labeled probes from transient transfection range from â¼0.5 mg/L for the complete ectodomain to >5 mg/L for several subregions. Probes are characterized for antigenicity and ACE2 recognition, and the structure of the spike ectodomain probe is determined by cryoelectron microscopy. We also characterize antibody-binding specificities and cell-sorting capabilities of the biotinylated probes. Altogether, structure-based design coupled to efficient purification and biotinylation processes can thus enable streamlined development of SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain probes.","Zhou, Tongqing; Teng, I-Ting; Olia, Adam S; Cerutti, Gabriele; Gorman, Jason; Nazzari, Alexandra; Shi, Wei; Tsybovsky, Yaroslav; Wang, Lingshu; Wang, Shuishu; Zhang, Baoshan; Zhang, Yi; Katsamba, Phinikoula S; Petrova, Yuliya; Banach, Bailey B; Fahad, Ahmed S; Liu, Lihong; Lopez Acevedo, Sheila N; Madan, Bharat; Oliveira de Souza, Matheus; Pan, Xiaoli; Wang, Pengfei; Wolfe, Jacy R; Yin, Michael; Ho, David D; Phung, Emily; DiPiazza, Anthony; Chang, Lauren A; Abiona, Olubukola M; Corbett, Kizzmekia S; DeKosky, Brandon J; Graham, Barney S; Mascola, John R; Misasi, John; Ruckwardt, Tracy; Sullivan, Nancy J; Shapiro, Lawrence; Kwong, Peter D",Cell Rep,365,20

The purpose of the current study was to describe the attitudes of workers towards COVID-19 vaccination prior to vaccination rollout, with a view to informing strategies to promote vaccine uptake within this high-risk sector. METHODS: An online survey was sent via email to workers supporting adults with ID in Ontario, Canada, between January 21 and February 3, 2021 by agency leadership and union representatives. RESULTS: Three thousand and three hundred and seventy-one workers, representing approximately 11.2% of Ontario workers supporting adults with ID completed an online survey. Most reported that they were very likely (62%) or likely (20%) to get a COVID-19 vaccine (vaccination intent) although 18% reported they were less likely to do so (vaccination nonintent). Workers with vaccination nonintent were younger and were more likely to endorse the beliefs that (1) it will not benefit them or those around them, (2) it was not part of their job, (3) rapid development confers uncertainties and risks, and (4) they were scared of potential vaccine side effects. CONCLUSIONS: There is need to address common misconceptions among workers supporting adults with ID to help activate them as vaccine advocates in the communities they serve.

However, the molecular mechanisms underneath remain poorly understood. In this study, 144 COVID-19 patients were enrolled to monitor the clinical and laboratory parameters over 3 weeks. Serum LDH was shown elevated in the COVID-19 patients on admission and declined throughout disease course, and its ability to classify patient severity outperformed other biochemical indicators. A threshold of 247 U/L serum LDH on admission was determined for severity prognosis. Next, we classified a subset of 14 patients into high- and low-risk groups based on serum LDH expression and compared their quantitative serum proteomic and metabolomic differences. The results showed that COVID-19 patients with high serum LDH exhibited differentially expressed blood coagulation and immune responses including acute inflammatory responses, platelet degranulation, complement cascade, as well as multiple different metabolic responses including lipid metabolism, protein ubiquitination and pyruvate fermentation. Specifically, activation of hypoxia responses was highlighted in patients with high LDH expressions. Taken together, our data showed that serum LDH levels are associated with COVID-19 severity, and that elevated serum LDH might be consequences of hypoxia and tissue injuries induced by inflammation.","Yan, Haixi; Liang, Xiao; Du, Juping; He, Zebao; Wang, Yu; Lyu, Mengge; Yue, Liang; Zhang, Fangfei; Xue, Zhangzhi; Xu, Luang; Ruan, Guan; Li, Jun; Zhu, Hongguo; Xu, Jiaqin; Chen, Shiyong; Zhang, Chao; Lv, Dongqing; Lin, Zongmei; Shen, Bo; Zhu, Yi; Qian, Biyun; Chen, Haixiao; Guo, Tiannan",Proteomics,365,24

Our objective is to describe the cardiac manifestations found in an international cohort of 55 pediatric cases with multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. Methods and Results We reviewed data on previously healthy pediatric patients (&#8804;18 years) with structurally normal hearts who presented at hospitals in the United States, United Kingdom, Spain and Pakistan with MIS-C and had consultation with a pediatric cardiologist. Data collected included demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory values, electrocardiographic abnormalities, echocardiographic findings and initial therapies. A total of 55 patients presented with MIS-C. Thirty-five patients (64%) had evidence of decreased left ventricular function, 17 (31%) had valvulitis, 12 (22%) with pericardial effusion and 11 (20%) with coronary abnormalities. Twenty-seven (49%) required ICU admission and 24 (44%) had evidence of shock. Eleven patients (20%) fulfilled complete Kawasaki disease criteria and had lower NT pro-BNP, D-dimer and ferritin levels compared with those who did not fulfill criteria. Electrophysiologic abnormalities occurred in 6 patients and included complete atrioventricular (AV) block, transient AV block and ventricular tachycardia.

Being an ophthalmologist himself, he has put the additional onus on us. The fact that the ocular manifestation could be the first presenting feature of novel coronavirus pneumonia should not be ignored and the possibility of spread of SARS-CoV-2 through the ocular secretions cannot be ruled out. However, with breakthroughs still evolving about this disease, the calls are now louder for closer examination on the pathogenesis of conjunctivitis associated with it. Hence, we conducted a scoping review of all available literature till date to fill in the “potential” gaps in currently available knowledge on ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in an attempt to establish continuity in the “chain of information” from December 2019 till April 2020. We also summarize a possible hypothesis on much less understood and highly debated topics on regard to the etiopathogenesis of ocular involvement in SARS-CoV-2 based on either presence or absence of ACE2 receptor in the ocular surface. Methods: We conducted a scoping review search of published and unpublished SARS-CoV-2-related English language articles from December 2019 till mid of April 2020 from the online databases. The findings were summarized using text, tables, diagrams, and flowcharts. Results: The commonest ocular manifestation in SARS-CoV-2 infection is follicular conjunctivitis and has been the first manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 3 reported cases till date. The ocular surface inoculated with the SARS-CoV-2 leads to the facilitation of the virus to the respiratory system via the lacrimal passage. RT-PCR analysis of the ocular secretions has shown the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides indicating the possibility of infection of ocular secretions. ACE2 receptors and its expression on the ocular mucosal surface are linked behind the etiopathogenesis of conjunctivitis. Conclusion: Conjunctivitis can be the presenting manifestation but may go unnoticed due to its mild nature. The ocular surface could serve as the entry gateway for the virus and ocular secretions could play a role in virus shed. The eye care personnel, as well as the general people, need to be more vigilant and adopt protective eye measures.","Sitaula, Ranju Kharel; Khatri, Anadi; Janani, M.

The true impact of prediabetes and type-2 diabetes in patients with COVID-19 remains unknown, with studies thus far providing conflicting evidence. Methods. This is a single-center retrospective observational study involving 843 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Primary outcomes, mortality, and mechanical ventilation use were compared among the three groups: control, prediabetes, and type-2 diabetes. Binomial regression analysis was used to determine predictors of mortality and mechanical ventilation requirement. Results. Age was a significant predictor of mortality. On stratifying our patients based on their age, older patients aged 55 years and above had no difference in mortality or mechanical ventilation requirement among the three groups of control, prediabetes, and type-2 diabetes. However, among the younger population aged less than 55 years, patients with type-2 diabetes had significantly higher mortality as compared with patients in control and prediabetes groups (27% vs 12.5% vs 9%, p 0.025). Additionally, newly diagnosed type-2 diabetes patients demonstrated lower mortality rate in comparison to previously known type-2 diabetes patients (18% vs 40%, p 0.005). Outcomes in the prediabetes group were similar to that in the control group. Admission hyperglycemia was associated with higher mortality regardless of diabetes status. Conclusion. In older patients aged 55 years and above, status of type-2 diabetes does not influence their mortality. However, in younger patients aged less than 55 years, the presence of type-2 diabetes is an important driver of mortality. Newly diagnosed type-2 diabetes, in comparison with previously diagnosed type-2 diabetes, may have better survival. Presence of prediabetes did not affect outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection.","Makker, Jasbir Sun Haozhe Patel Harish Mantri Nikhitha Zahid Maleeha Gongati Sudharsan Galiveeti Sneha Renner Sharon W.; Chilimuri, Sridhar",International Journal of Endocrinology,365,21

Published data suggests that patients with a history of or active malignancy are at increased risk of infection and developing COVID-19 related complications. To date, the published data has analyzed the seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection in the general population, but not in cancer patients. Here we present the results of prevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in cancer patients from the University Hospital of Torrejón (Torrejón de Ardoz, Madrid, Spain). METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies was assessed using a commercially available rapid test (Testsealabs® IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette) and collect the result from cancer outpatients who attended the medical oncology consult at University Hospital of Torrejón between June 1st and June 19th, 2020. FINDINGS: We analyzed the serological test results of 229 cancer patients. We estimated an overall seroprevalence (IgG or IgM positive) of 31.4%. The probability of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was similar between men and women, type of treatment and cancer stage. The probability of seropositivity was significantly higher in cancer patients with pneumonia compared with cancer patients without pneumonia (Odds Ratio (OR) 7.65 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1,85-31,58]).

SOURCE OF DATA: The PubMed, WHO COVID-19, and SciELO databases were searched on March 15, 2020, and on April 25, 2020, filtering for children (0-18 years) and humans. SYNTHESIS OF DATA: The tools used to mitigate the threat of a pandemic such as COVID-19 may very well threaten child growth and development. These tools - such as social restrictions, shutdowns, and school closures - contribute to stress in parents and children and can become risk factors that threaten child growth and development and may compromise the Sustainable Development Goals. The studies reviewed suggest that epidemics can lead to high levels of stress in parents and children, which begin with concerns about children becoming infected. These studies describe several potential mental and emotional consequences of epidemics such as COVID-19, H1N1, AIDS, and Ebola: severe anxiety or depression among parents and acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress, anxiety disorders, and depression among children. These data can be related to adverse childhood experiences and elevated risk of toxic stress. The more adverse experiences, the greater the risk of developmental delays and health problems in adulthood, such as cognitive impairment, substance abuse, depression, and non-communicable diseases. CONCLUSION: Information about the impact of epidemics on parents and children is relevant to policy makers to aid them in developing strategies to help families cope with epidemic/pandemic-driven adversity and ensure their children's healthy development.","Araújo, Liubiana Arantes de; Veloso, Cássio Frederico; Souza, Matheus de Campos; Azevedo, João Marcos Coelho de; Tarro, Giulio",,365,1

To examine the trends of ocular emergency admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic at a tertiary care center. Methods. The study's sample consisted of all patients who were seen in the ophthalmic emergency room (OER) between March 15 and April 15, 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) and in the same time frame of the previous year. The cases were categorized as urgent vs. nonurgent according to the AAO urgency guidelines during the coronavirus period, and the ability to treat the case with telemedicine was evaluated retrospectively. Results. A total of 553 patients were admitted to the OER during the pandemic period, whereas in the same time frame of the previous year, 1,069 were admitted. The female/male proportion was 526/543 (49.2%/50.8%) in 2019 and 258/259 (46.7%/53.3%) the following year. Age (years, average ± SD) was 44.7 ± 24.5 in 2019 and 47.9 ± 23.4 in 2020. There were more self-referrals in 2020 compared to 2019 (41.1% vs. 32.6%;p = 0.0004). The time spent in the OER was reduced from 109 ± 74 (minutes, average ± SDV) in 2019 to 73 ± 51 in 2020 (p &lt; 0.0001). The most common cause of OER examinations in 2020 was related to the posterior segment of the eye (23.9%), whereas infection and inflammation of the anterior segment were the most common causes in 2019 (35.5%). Urgency by AAO standards was in agreement in 26.7% admissions in 2019 and 35.6% in 2020 (p = 0.0002). Conclusion. The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced several aspects of the OER, including the number of referrals, type of ophthalmic emergency, the time spent in the OER, and the need for emergent treatment. Our change in the treatment algorithm was in agreement with the AAO recommendations during the pandemic.

TRIAL DESIGN: Two separate multi-centre placebo-controlled parallel group randomized trials PARTICIPANTS: (1) Health care personnel working in the hospital or ambulance service where they will take care of patients with the COVID-19 infection and (2) elderly &#8805;60 years. The HCW trial is being undertaken in 9 hospitals. The elderly trial is being undertaken in locations in the community in Nijmegen, Utrecht, and Veghel, in the Netherlands, using senior citizen organisations to facilitate recruitment. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: For both trials the intervention group will be randomized to vaccination with 0.1 ml of the licensed BCG vaccine (Danish strain 1331, SSI, Denmark, equivalent to 0.075 mg attenuated M. bovis). The placebo group consists of 0.1 ml 0.9% NaCl, which is the same amount, and has the same colour and appearance as the suspended BCG vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES: (1) Number of days of unplanned work absenteeism in HCWs for any reason which can be continuously measured on a bi-weekly basis, and (2) the cumulative incidence of hospital admission due to documented COVID-19. RANDOMISATION: Participants will be randomized to BCG vaccine or placebo (1;1) centrally using a computer- based system, stratified by study centre. BLINDING (MASKING): Subjects, investigators, physicians and outcome assessors are blinded for the intervention. Only the pharmacist assistant that prepares- and research personnel that administers- study medicines are unblinded. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): (1) The sample size for the first trial is N=1500 HCWs randomised 1:1 to either BCG vaccine (n=750) and placebo (n=750) and (2) The sample size for the second trial is N=1600 elderly persons randomised to BCG vaccine (n=800) and the placebo group (n=800). TRIAL STATUS: HCW: version 4.0, 24-04-2020. Recruitment began 25-03-2020 and was completed on the 23-04-2020. Elderly: version 3.0, 04-04-2020. Recruitment began 16-04- 2020 and is ongoing. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The HCWs trial was registered 31-03-2020 at clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT04328441) and registered 20-03-2020 at the Dutch Trial Registry (trialregister.nl, identifier Trial NL8477). The elderly trial was registered 22-04-2020 at the Dutch trial registry with number NL8547.

Infectious disease specialists, pneumologists and intensivists were not enough to face the enormous amount of patients that needed hospital care; therefore, many doctors have been recruited from other medical specialties trying to take care of as many patients as possible. The 'call to duty' of such doctors for urgent COVID-19 cases, however, diverted the attention from the care of patients with chronic conditions, which might have been neglected or undervalued. In this extremely difficult time, the standard of care of chronic patients has been reduced and this might have determined an increased rate of complications secondary to undermanagement. Thousands of patients with acute and chronic non-COVID-19 conditions have not accessed specialist care in the last weeks in Italy. Moreover, even those patients who have had scheduled an outpatient visit did not attend it for fear of leaving their home or due to the inability to go. During the pandemic, there was a drastic reduction in the number of hospital admissions for any medical conditions different from COVID-19. Self-presentation to the emergency department (ED) has been discouraged and the patients' own fear of being infected by going to the hospital led to also a significant decrease in ED access. During the lockdown, in San Giuseppe Hospital MultiMedica IRCCS, Milan, the ED admissions dropped from the mean of 2361/month in December 2019-February 2020 to 1102 (- 53%) and 861 (- 63%) in March and April 2020, respectively. For all the above-mentioned reasons, it is possible that some clinical conditions will further progress with a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. To prevent this, it is essential that patients with chronic conditions should be at least monitored and managed with telephone or online health consultation, identifying those who need urgent access to care, prioritizing outpatient visits based on disease severity. Patients with mild conditions could be managed outside the hospital by implementing telemedicine and creating networks of general practitioners who can consult with in-hospital specialists.","Mauro, Viganò; Lorenzo, Mantovani; Paolo, Cozzolino; Sergio, Harari",Intern Emerg Med,365,5

In this experimental approach, we propose to assess: (1) uterine morphology and cytodifferentiation, (2) uterine cell proliferation, and (3) the expression of proteins involved in uterine organogenetic differentiation. All these morphological and molecular markers are useful tools to determine the consequences of exposure to toxicants with the potential to disrupt the uterine development.","Guerrero Schimpf, Marlise; Milesi, María M; Luque, Enrique H; Varayoud, Jorgelina",Methods Mol Biol,365,1

The prevalence of such antibodies among healthcare workers, presumed at higher risk for infection, has been increasingly investigated, more studies are needed to better understand the risks and infection transmission in different healthcare settings. The present study reports on initial sero-surveillance conducted on healthcare workers at a regional hospital system in Orange County, California, during May and June, 2020. Study subjects were recruited from the entire hospital employee workforce and the independent medical staff. Data were collected for job duties and locations, COVID-19 symptoms, a PCR test history, travel record since January 2020, and existence of household contacts with COVID-19. A blood sample was collected from each subject for serum analysis for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Of 2,992 tested individuals, a total 2,924 with complete data were included in the analysis. Observed prevalence of 1.06% (31 antibody positive cases), adjusted prevalence of 1.13% for test sensitivity and specificity were identified. Significant group differences between positive vs. negative were observed for age (z = 2.65, p = .008), race (p = .037), presence of fever (p < .001), and loss of smell (p < .001), but not for occupations (p = .710). Possible explanation for this low prevalence includes a relatively low local geographic community prevalence (~4.4%) at the time of testing, the hospital's timely procurement of personal protective equipment, rigorous employee education, patient triage, and treatment protocol development and implementation. In addition, cross-reactive adaptive T cell mediated immunity, as recently described, may possibly play a greater role in healthcare workers than in the general population.","Brant-Zawadzki, Michael; Fridman, Deborah; Robinson, Philip A; Zahn, Matthew; Chau, Clayton; German, Randy; Breit, Marcus; Bock, Jason R; Hara, Junko",PLoS One,365,16

Low-and-middle income countries (LMICs) dependent on private providers as a consequence of neglect of national health systems or imposed conditionalities under neoliberal governance were particularly effected. When beds were most needed for the treatment of acute COVID-19 cases, private providers suffered a liquidity crisis, itself propelled by the primary effects of lockdowns, government regulations and patient deferrals, and the secondary economic impacts of the pandemic. This led to a private sector response-involving, variously, hospital closures, furloughing of staff, refusals of treatment, and attempts to profit by gouging patients. A crisis in state and government relations has multiplied across LMICs. Amid widespread national governance failures-either crisis bound or historic-with regards to poorly resourced public health services and burgeoning private health-governments have responded with increasing legal and financial interventions into national health markets. In contrast, multilateral governance has been path dependent with regard to ongoing commitments to privately provided health. Indeed, the global financial institutions appear to be using the COVID crisis as a means to recommit to the roll out of markets in global health, this involving the further scaling back of the state.","Williams, Owain David",Development (Rome),365,1

Mattering is the feeling of being important to others in ways that give people the sense that they are valued and other people care about them. We contrast this feeling with messages of not mattering and being expendable and disposable due to ageism, gaps in the provision of care, and apparently economically focused positions taken during the pandemic that disrespect the value, worth, and merits of older persons. We provide a comprehensive review of past research on individual differences in mattering among older adults and illustrate the unique role of mattering in potentially protecting older adults from mental health problems. Mattering is also discussed in terms of its links with loneliness and physical health. This article concludes with a discussion of initiatives and interventions that can be modified and enhanced to instill a sense of mattering among older adults. Key directions for future research are also highlighted along with ways to expand the mattering concept to more fully understand and appreciate the relevance of mattering among older adults.","Flett, Gordon L; Heisel, Marnin J",Int J Ment Health Addict,365,26

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: The emergency expansion of an ICU from eight general beds to 30 coronavirus disease 2019 beds. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to the ICU of Luigi Sacco Hospital (Milan, Italy) for greater than or equal to 48 hours between February 21, 2020, and April 30, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The frequency of bloodstream infections per 1,000 days of ICU stay was calculated in 89 coronavirus disease 2019 patients, and the cumulative probability of bloodstream infection was estimated using death and ICU discharge as competing events. Sixty patients (67.4%) experienced at least one of the 93 recorded episodes of bloodstream infection, a frequency of 87 per 1,000 days of ICU stay (95% CI, 67-112).The patients who experienced a bloodstream infection had a higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score upon ICU admission (9.5; interquartile range, 8-12 vs 8, interquartile range, 5-10; p = 0.042), a longer median ICU stay (15 d; interquartile range, 11-23 vs 8, interquartile range, 5-12; p < 0.001), and more frequently required invasive mechanical ventilation (98.3% vs 82.8%; p = 0.013) than those who did not. The median time from ICU admission to the first bloodstream infection episode was 10 days. Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 74 episodes (79.6%), with Enterococcus species being the most prevalent (53 episodes, 55.8%). Thirty-two isolates (27.3%) showed multidrug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Coronavirus disease 2019 seemed to increase the frequency of bloodstream infections (particularly Enterococcus-related bloodstream infection) after ICU admission. This may have been due to enteric involvement in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 and/or limitations in controlling the patient-to-patient transmission of infectious agents in extremely challenging circumstances.","Bonazzetti, Cecilia; Morena, Valentina; Giacomelli, Andrea; Oreni, Letizia; Casalini, Giacomo; Galimberti, Laura Rina; Bolis, Matteo; Rimoldi, Matteo; Ballone, Elisabetta; Colombo, Riccardo; Ridolfo, Anna Lisa; Antinori, Spinello",Crit. care med,365,15

In so doing, this theme issue presents case studies from across the globe and examines them from academic and practitioner perspectives. The case studies cover: hospitality, tourism agriculture, events, small and medium sized businesses, sport, the African Union as a regional organisation and wildlife tourism. Ultimately, the objective is to encourage countries to implement the SDGs by highlighting the benefits they bring to the economy, society and the environment.Design/methodology/approachThis paper outlines the theme issue approach which draws on a blend of case studies, online sources, literature review and industry reports. This combination of primary, secondary and tertiary data enables a meaningful analysis of the implementation of SDGs in destinations with different requirements and characteristics.FindingsThe theme issue findings provide insights on the history, status and progress of SDGs in hospitality and tourism worldwide. Based on reviews and practical evidence, it is clear that many countries have not yet successfully implemented the SDGs, whereas others have made significant progress by embracing sustainable action. The overall observations point towards collaboration between stakeholders, and the scale of organisations as a sine qua non condition for the achievement of sustainability.Originality/valueThe value of this theme issue is that it presents a variety of case studies that demonstrate how different countries have successfully implemented the SDGs and the challenges faced while embracing those actions. Each case presented is unique and the variety of strategies proposed therein serves as guide to practitioners and destination managers. Further, the findings may be applicable to other geographic regions with similar contexts.","Seraphin, Hugues Gowreesunkar Vanessa G. B.",Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes,365,8

The pandemic, however, is not only about becoming physically ill. It has many psychosocial aspects: people are exposed to myriad life challenges. The life story approach does not ignore physical status but also emphasizes psychosocial strengths. It highlights that older people are likely to have developed resilience through experiencing life challenges and living across history. METHODS: We used the narrative method to review research on three strengths: tendency toward life reflection, adaptive use of personal memory, and temporal focus encouraging generativity. RESULTS: For each, we (i) present evidence that this strength manifests in the second half of life, and (ii) identify how it may specifically be applied in dealing with the challenges of the pandemic. In considering their life stories, the picture that emerges is one of older adults as having the potential to show considerable psychosocial strength despite the adversities of the pandemic.

She failed conventional management and underwent venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Despite multiple infections and a pneumothorax, she eventually recovered. Chlorine gas was the first agent of chemical warfare which caused a massive death toll during the First World War. Even today, the chemical is produced in large quantities and the threat of a large-scale leak is ever-present from industrial accidents or terrorist attacks. The criteria to assess and manage chlorine gas-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome are likely to be the same as for other causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be used successfully.","Harischandra, Tolusha; Withanaarachchi, Kapilani; Piyasiri, Bhagya; Wickramasuriya, Hesaru; Piyasiri, Gihan; Firmin, Richard",Perfusion,365,1

Rational use requires: (1) modification of the clozapine package insert worldwide to include lower doses for Asians and to avoid the lethality associated with pneumonia, (2) the use of clozapine levels for personalizing dosing, and (3) the use of slow and personalized titration. This may make clozapine as safe as possible and contribute to increased life expectancy and well-being. In the absence of data on COVID-19 in clozapine patients, clozapine possibly impairs immunological mechanisms and may increase pneumonia risk in infected patients. Psychiatrists should call their clozapine patients and families and explain to them that if the patient develops fever or flu-like symptoms, the psychiatrist should be called and should consider halving the clozapine dose. If the patient is hospitalized with pneumonia, the treating physician needs to assess for symptoms of clozapine intoxication since halving the dose may not be enough for all patients; consider decreasing it to one-third or even stopping it. Once the signs of inflammation and fever have disappeared, the clozapine dose can be slowly increased to the prior dosage level.","de Leon, Jose; Ruan, Can-Jun; Schoretsanitis, Georgios; De Las Cuevas, Carlos",Psychother Psychosom,365,27

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the clinical features of mask-induced dermatoses and recommend prevention and treatment options. METHODS: From April to August 2020, questionnaires including preexisting skin disorders, patients' reported mask-related symptoms, their daily mask wearing duration and frequency, types of masks used, whether they are health care workers, and demographic information were distributed to patients of 12 hospitals. Dermatologists assessed skin lesions, confirmed diagnosis, and recorded treatment modalities. RESULTS: Itchiness was the most frequent symptom, mostly affecting the cheeks. Most common skin disease was new-onset contact dermatitis (33.94%), followed by new-onset acne (16.97%) and aggravation of preexisting acne (16.97%). Daily wearing (p=0.018) was significantly associated with new-onset contact dermatitis. More than half of the patients with preexisting skin problems experienced aggravation while wearing masks. Longer duration (more than 6 hours/day, p=0.043) and cotton masks (p<0.001) significantly increased acne flare-up. Healthcare workers had a higher incidence of skin disease. Skin lesions were generally mild and well tolerated with topical agents. LIMITATIONS: Effect of seasonal characteristics and other risk factors were not assessed. The patients were visiting dermatologic clinics and had interest in their skin status. Thus, a selection bias may exist.

Both PHARMASCREEN and CARS screening models successfully identified at-risk individuals despite differences in healthcare systems, infrastructure, and scope of practice. Comparing pharmacists' experiences of screening delivery in different health systems will help to understand key contextual factors that affect future implementation. OBJECTIVE: To explore and compare the views and experiences of pharmacists participating in the UAE PHARMACSCREEN trial, with those of community pharmacists who participated in the Australian CARS trial. METHODS: In-depth, face-to-face interviews were conducted with pharmacists who delivered the screening programs in Australia (n = 10) and UAE (n = 12) to explore their views and experiences. The interview guide was similar in both studies to ensure consistency and comparability of collected data. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Two common themes emerged: pharmacists' experiences with the screening program, and barriers and facilitators to service delivery. Both groups held very positive views about the screening intervention, particularly referencing the professional satisfaction it generated and broad participant satisfaction with pharmacy-based screening. Despite country and health system differences, pharmacists reported many similar barriers (e.g., staffing levels, pharmacy coordination) and enablers (e.g., implementation support, adequate staffing, point-of-care tests, no cost to patient) to implementation. The context for screening delivery emerged as a key theme for UAE interviews only, where issues such as local population needs, regulatory factors, pharmacist roles and expectations, and training needs were quite prominent. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists' positive experiences with the screening programs is a testimony to the strong emerging evidence supporting pharmacists-delivered screening. Despite differences in health care systems, similar enablers and barriers were identified. The adaptation and successful implementation of international screening models requires a country-specific adaptation process.","Alzubaidi, Hamzah; Namara, Kevin Mc; Saidawi, Ward; Hasan, Sanah; Krass, Ines",Res. soc. adm. pharm,365,16

The pandemic was well contained initially until early April 2020, when there was a surge in cases, attributed to Singapore residents returning from hotspots overseas, and more significantly, rapid transmission locally within migrant worker dormitories. In this paper, we present the response of Singapore to the COVID-19 pandemic based on core dimensions of health system resilience during outbreaks. We also discussed on the surge in cases in April 2020, highlighting efforts to mitigate it. There was: (1) clear leadership and governance which adopted flexible plans appropriate to the situation; (2) timely, accurate and transparent communication from the government; (3) public health measures to reduce imported cases, and detect as well as isolate cases early; (4) maintenance of health service delivery; (5) access to crisis financing; and (6) legal foundation to complement policy measures. Areas for improvement include understanding reasons for poor uptake of government initiatives, such as the mobile application for contact tracing and adopting a more inclusive response that protects all individuals, including at-risk populations.

The primary outcome was a combination of ventilation variables and parameters over the first four calendar days of ventilation, including tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), respiratory system compliance, and driving pressure in normal-weight, overweight, and obese patients. Secondary outcomes included the use of adjunctive treatments for refractory hypoxaemia and mortality rates. Between 1 March 2020 and 1 June 2020, 1122 patients were included in the study: 244 (21.3%) normal-weight patients, 531 (47.3%) overweight patients, and 324 (28.8%) obese patients. Most patients received a tidal volume < 8 mL/kg PBW; only on the first day was the tidal volume higher in obese patients. PEEP and driving pressure were higher, and compliance of the respiratory system was lower in obese patients on all four days. Adjunctive therapies for refractory hypoxemia were used equally in the three BMI groups. Adjusted mortality rates were not different between BMI categories. The findings of this study suggest that lung-protective ventilation with a lower tidal volume and prone positioning is similarly feasible in normal-weight, overweight, and obese patients with ARDS related to COVID-19. A patient's BMI should not be used in decisions to forgo or proceed with invasive ventilation.","Schavemaker, Renée; Schultz, Marcus J; Lagrand, Wim K; van Slobbe-Bijlsma, Eline R; Serpa Neto, Ary; Paulus, Frederique",,365,16

This was a single-center, retrospective, observational, cohort study conducted at a tertiary critical care center in Kyoto City, Japan. Adult OHCA patients arriving at our hospital under CPR between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020 were included. Our hospital implemented a revised resuscitation protocol for OHCA patients on April 1, 2020 to prevent COVID-19 transmission. This study defined the conventional CPR period as January 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, and the COVID-19 safety protocol period as April 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Throughout the prehospital and in-hospital settings, resuscitation protocols about wearing personal protective equipment and airway management were revised in order to minimize the risk of infection; otherwise, the other resuscitation management had not been changed. The primary outcome was hospitalization survival. The secondary outcomes were return of spontaneous circulation after hospital arrival and 1-month survival after OHCA occurrence. The adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for outcomes to compare the two study periods, and the multivariable logistic model was used to adjust for potential confounders. The study analyzed 443 patients, with a median age of 76 years (65-85), and included 261 men (58.9%). The percentage of hospitalization survivors during the entire research period was 16.9% (75/443 patients), with 18.7% (50/267) during the conventional CPR period and 14.2% (25/176) during the COVID-19 safety protocol period. The adjusted odds ratio for hospitalization survival during the COVID-19 safety protocol period was 0.61 (95% CI 0.32-1.18), as compared with conventional CPR. There were no cases of COVID-19 infection among the staff involved in the resuscitation in our hospital. There was no apparent difference in hospitalization survival between the OHCA patients resuscitated under the conventional CPR protocol compared with the current revised protocol for controlling COVID-19 transmission.","Kandori, Kenji; Okada, Yohei; Ishii, Wataru; Narumiya, Hiromichi; Iizuka, Ryoji",Sci Rep,365,1

Objective: We aimed to assess the teledermatology experiences of new and existing clinic patients in the context of the rapid shift toward teledermatology practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 184 teledermatology patients who were assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic at a major southeastern medical center from May 13 to June 5, 2020. The primary outcome was patient satisfaction levels among new and existing patients. The secondary outcome was patients' willingness to use teledermatology in the future. Results: Of the 288 teledermatology patients who were assessed during the study period, 184 (63.9%) completed the survey. Patients reported high overall satisfaction with teledermatology, with 86.4% (159/184) of participants reporting positive overall satisfaction and experiences with teledermatology. New patients had significantly higher Likert scores for overall satisfaction with teledermatology than those of follow-up patients (new patients: mean 4.70; existing patients: mean 4.43; P=.03). Overall, patients' satisfaction with teledermatology did not significantly differ based on age (P=.36), race and ethnicity (P=.46), education level (P=.11), residence (P=.74), or insurance status (P=.74). There were no significant differences in overall satisfaction between patients with and without prior telehealth experience (P=.53), between the video and telephone visit types (P=.17), and among platform types (P=.22). Prior telehealth experience was associated with higher odds of being willing to use telehealth in the future (odds ratio 2.39, 95% CI 1.31-4.35; P=.004). Conclusions: This cross-sectional survey study demonstrates that during the rapid expansion of teledermatology, new clinic patients had significantly higher scores for overall satisfaction with their teledermatology experience compared to those of established clinic patients (P=.03). Prior telehealth experience was associated with higher odds of being willing to use teledermatology in the future.

Cancer patients are considered a vulnerable population to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may develop several COVID-19 symptoms. The heightened immunocompromised state, prolonged chronic pro-inflammatory milieu coupled with comorbid conditions are shared in both disease conditions and may influence patient outcome. Although ovarian cancer (OC) and COVID-19 are diseases of entirely different primary organs, both diseases share similar molecular and cellular characteristics in their microenvironment suggesting a potential cooperativity leading to poor outcome. In COVID-19 related cases, hospitalizations and deaths worldwide are lower in women than in males; however, comorbidities associated with OC may increase the COVID-19 risk in women. The women at the age of 50-60 years are at greater risk of developing OC as well as SARS-CoV-2 infection. Increased levels of gonadotropin and androgen, dysregulated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), hyper-coagulation and chronic inflammation are common conditions observed among OC and severe cases of COVID-19. The upregulation of common inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;), interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, interferon-Î³-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), among others in the sera of COVID-19 and OC subjects suggests potentially similar mechanism(s) involved in the hyper-inflammatory condition observed in both disease states. Thus, it is conceivable that the pathogenesis of OC may significantly contribute to the potential infection by SARS-CoV-2. Our understanding of the influence and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection on OC is at an early stage and in this article, we review the underlying pathogenesis presented by various comorbidities of OC and correlate their influence on SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Chaudhari, Sima; Dey Pereira, Satyajit; Asare-Warehene, Meshach; Naha, Ritam; Kabekkodu, Shama Prasada; Tsang, Benjamin K; Satyamoorthy, Kapaettu",J Ovarian Res,365,20

We describe a successful initial experience implementing a virtual elective in interventional radiology (IR) and provide the course framework, student feedback, and potential improvements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 2-week virtual IR elective curriculum was created utilizing a combination of synchronous and asynchronous learning and the ""flipped"" classroom educational model. Students virtually participated in daily IR resident education conferences, resident-led case review sessions, and dedicated lectures. Asynchronous prelearning material consisted of text and video correlating to lecture topics. Anonymous precourse and postcourse surveys were sent to all participating students (nâ¯=â¯10). RESULTS: Ten students (100%) completed precourse and seven (70%) completed postcourse surveys. Enrolled students were considering residencies in surgery (50%), internal medicine (40%), interventional radiology (30%), and/or diagnostic radiology (30%). Students' understanding of what IRs do and the procedures they perform (p < 0.001), when to consult IR for assistance in patient management (pâ¯=â¯0.005), and the number of IR procedures students could recall (pâ¯=â¯0.015) improved after the course. Case-review sessions and virtual lectures ranked as having the highest education value. Students recommended additional small-group case workshops. CONCLUSION: This successful virtual IR elective provides a framework for others to continue IR medical student education during the pandemic and grow the specialty's presence within an increasingly virtual medical school curriculum. The described model may be modified to improve IR education beyond the COVID-19 era.","DePietro, Daniel M; Santucci, Sarah E; Harrison, Neil E; Kiefer, Ryan M; Trerotola, Scott O; Sudheendra, Deepak; Shamimi-Noori, Susan",Acad Radiol,365,24

Despite these growing perils, there remains a notable paucity of data science research to scientifically inform equitable public policy decisions for improving the livelihood of at-risk populations. Scattered data science efforts exist to address these challenges, but they remain isolated from practice and prone to algorithmic harms concerning lack of privacy, fairness, interpretability, accountability, transparency, and ethics. Biases in data-driven methods carry the risk of amplifying inequalities in high-stakes policy decisions that impact the livelihood of millions of people. Consequently, proclaimed benefits of data-driven innovations remain inaccessible to policymakers, practitioners, and marginalized communities at the core of humanitarian actions and global development.

Coronaviruses enter cells via fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane and/or via fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes after virion endocytosis. The spike (S) glycoprotein is a major determinant of virus infectivity. Herein, we show that the transient expression of the SARS CoV-2 S glycoprotein in Vero cells caused extensive cell fusion (formation of syncytia) in comparison to limited cell fusion caused by the SARS S glycoprotein. Both S glycoproteins were detected intracellularly and on transfected Vero cell surfaces. These results are in agreement with published pathology observations of extensive syncytia formation in lung tissues of patients with COVID-19. These results suggest that SARS CoV-2 is able to spread from cell-to-cell much more efficiently than SARS effectively avoiding extracellular neutralizing antibodies. A systematic screening of several drugs including cardiac glycosides and kinase inhibitors and inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) entry revealed that only the FDA-approved HIV protease inhibitor, nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept) drastically inhibited S-n- and S-o-mediated cell fusion with complete inhibition at a 10-µM concentration. In-silico docking experiments suggested the possibility that nelfinavir may bind inside the S trimer structure, proximal to the S2 amino terminus directly inhibiting S-n- and S-o-mediated membrane fusion. Also, it is possible that nelfinavir may act to inhibit S proteolytic processing within cells. These results warrant further investigations of the potential of nelfinavir mesylate to inhibit virus spread at early times after SARS CoV-2 symptoms appear.","Musarrat, Farhana; Chouljenko, Vladimir; Dahal, Achyut; Nabi, Rafiq; Chouljenko, Tamara; Jois, Seetharama D; Kousoulas, Konstantin G",J. med. virol,365,21

It stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome, which affects the lungs. The process of replication and progression of the COVID-19 virus causes the formation of an excessive amount of reactive oxygen species and inflammation. Many studies have been carried out that have demonstrated that hydrogen has strong anti-inflammatory properties. It reduces hypotension and other symptoms by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. Oxygen mixture, enriched with Hydrogen, - helps to reduce the resistance of the respiratory tract and frees up access to the pulmonary alveolus, which improves the penetration of oxygen into the lungs. Since hydrogen is an antioxidant, it helps to reduce the burden on the immune system, helps to maintain the body's health and its ability to quickly recover. When electrolysers are used to produce an oxygen-hydrogen mixture, alkaline mist and other impurities can enter the patient's lungs and cause poisoning and chemical burns. For this reason, the use of atomic hydrogen obtained from metal hydride sources for ventilation of the lungs will be more effective for treating COVID-19 than a molecular hydrogen-oxygen mixture from an electrolyzer. A functional diagram of a metal hydride source of atomic hydrogen to an artificial lung ventilator is shown.

Recently, deep learning methods have carried out state-of-the-art performances on medical imaging tasks. However, conventional deep learning has two major drawbacks: 1) insufficient training data and 2) the domain mismatch between the training data and the testing data. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning framework for medical image classification. Moreover, we apply our method to a recent issue (Coronavirus Diagnose). Several studies indicate that lung Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used for a fast and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis. However, well-labeled training data sets cannot be easily accessed due to the novelty of the disease and the privacy policies. The proposed method has two components: Reduced-size Unet Segmentation model and Distant Feature Fusion (DFF) classification model. This study is related to a not well-investigated but important transfer learning problem, termed Distant Domain Transfer Learning (DDTL). In this study, we develop a DDTL model for COVID-19 diagnose using unlabeled Office-31, Caltech-256, and chest X-ray image data sets as the source data, and a small set of labeled COVID-19 lung CT as the target data. The main contributions of this study are: 1) the proposed method benefits from unlabeled data in distant domains which can be easily accessed, 2) it can effectively handle the distribution shift between the training data and the testing data, 3) it has achieved 96% classification accuracy, which is 13% higher classification accuracy than ""non-transfer"" algorithms, and 8% higher than existing transfer and distant transfer algorithms.","Niu, Shuteng; Liu, Meryl; Liu, Yongxin; Wang, Jian; Song, Houbing",IEEE j. biomed. health inform.

The outbreak required a thorough reorganization of the Italian regional local health care system to preserve resources such as ventilators, beds in intensive care units and surgical and anaesthesiological staff. Levels of priority were created, together with a rigorous triage procedure for patients with COVID-19, which led to postponement of all elective procedures. Urgent cases were discussed with the local heart team and percutaneous approaches were selected as the first treatment option to reduce hospital stay. COVID-19 and COVID-19-free pathways were created, including adequate preparation of the operating room, management of anaesthesiological procedures, transportation of patients and disinfection. It was determined that patients with chronic diseases were at increased risk of adverse outcomes. Systemic inflammation, cytokine storm and hypercoagulability associated with COVID-19 increased the risk of heart failure and cardiac death. In this regard, the early use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation could be life-saving in patients with severe forms of acute respiratory distress syndrome or refractory heart failure. The goal of this paper was to report the Italian experience during the COVID-19 pandemic in the setting of cardiovascular surgery.","Donatelli, Francesco; Miceli, Antonio; Glauber, Mattia; Cirri, Silvia; Maiello, Ciro; Coscioni, Enrico; Napoli, Claudio",Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg,365,24

In most infected children, the disease manifests itself in a mild or is char- acterized by a subclinical course. At the same time, in some cases, a severe clinical picture of the so-called late Covid disease may develop, in the form of a multisystem syndrome and other complications. In 2020-2021 at the Academic Pediatric Clinic named after G. Zhvania of Tbilisi State Medical University, we observed 60 children with post-Covid complications and late Covid syn- drome. More than half (32 children - 53.3%) were under 5 years of age, with a predominance of boys (33 children - 55%) who had a Covid-19 infection 1.5-2 months before contacting us with a positive antibody reaction. Most of them (51 children - 85%) were healthy before the disease. Vasculopathy, immune thrombocytopenia, thalassemia minor, primary diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, coagulopathy, pneumonia-atelectasis, exacerbation of the underlying disease - arthralgia, arthritis and abnormal manifestations of sleep disturbance, general weakness and dizziness were noted. Separately, it is necessary to highlight the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in chirdren - MIS-C (8 children - 13%) proceeding with clinical signs of Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous-lymphatic syndrome) with hectic temperature, polyserositis, hepatosplenomegaly, high rates of inflammation markers, a tendency to hypercoagulability. One patient had a coronary artery aneurysm. In 3 cases, the ANA and ANF titer was increased (up to 1:640) and also with nucleic, cytoplasmic and linear fibrils fluorescence, which indicates immune reactions in Covid infection, which can explain the positive effect of corticosteroid therapy in the treatment of these patients. Only 22 (36%) patients were hospitalized, the rest were observed on an outpatient basis. Based on the aforementioned, it can be concluded that even with the asymptomatic course of Covidinfection in children, complications can be observed and the syndrome of the so-called late Covid, which dictates the need for a thorough examination of these patients and observation in dynamics.","Zhvania, M.; Kvezereli-Kopadze, M.; Kutubidze, T.; Kapanadze, N.; Gordeladze, M.; Iakobashvili, A.; Nakhutsrishvili, E.",Georgian Medical News,365,1

AIM: To evaluate the evidence for aerosol production and transmission of respiratory infection associated with procedures that involve airway suctioning or induce coughing/sneezing. METHODS: The review was informed by PRISMA guidelines. Searches were conducted in PubMed for studies published between January 1st, 2003 and October 6th, 2020. Included studies examined whether nasogastric tube insertion, lung function tests, nasendoscopy, dysphagia assessment, or suctioning for airway clearance result in aerosol generation or transmission of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS, or influenza. Risk of bias assessment focused on robustness of measurement, control for confounding, and applicability to clinical practice. FINDINGS: Eighteen primary studies and two systematic reviews were included. Three epidemiological studies found no association between nasogastric tube insertion and acquisition of respiratory infections. One simulation study found low/very low production of aerosols associated with pulmonary lung function tests. Seven simulation studies of endoscopic sinus surgery suggested significant increases in aerosols but findings were inconsistent; two clinical studies found airborne particles associated with the use of microdebriders/drills. Some simulation studies did not use robust measures to detect particles and are difficult to equate to clinical conditions. CONCLUSION: There was an absence of evidence to suggest that the procedures included in the review were associated with an increased risk of transmission of respiratory infection. In order to better target precautions to mitigate risk, more research is required to determine the characteristics of medical procedures and patients that increase the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Wilson, J; Carson, G; Fitzgerald, S; Llewelyn, M J; Jenkins, D; Parker, S; Boies, A; Thomas, J; Sutcliffe, K; Sowden, A J; O039,; Mara-Eves, A; Stansfield, C; Harriss, E; Reilly, J",J Hosp Infect,365,1

The hyperspectral (HS) imaging system is a rising innovation that can be utilized to build a highly sensitive, non-invasive, and tissue hemoglobin immersion map. OBJECTIVE: As a result of the urgent need to design and implement early detection devices and applications for the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose building a non-invasive custom optical imaging system to assist with phlebotomy and vascular approach to survey the reliability of blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels recovered from spectral images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HS images were gathered from 15 healthy subjects without previous medical history complications and with an average age range of 20 to 38 years, who were undergoing phlebotomy. The forearm was vigorously illuminated utilizing an HS camera with polychromatic source light of spectrum range (400â¼980 nm). Spectroscopic reflectance images were caught by a focal plane exhibit for the region of interest (ROI). Then the custom algorithm comprising normalization and moving average filtering for noise removal was applied, followed by K-mean clustering for image segmentation to visualize and highlight the arteries and the veins in the investigated forearm. RESULTS: The investigations show that after normalization of the recorded signal from the HS camera of the participating subjects it was noticed that at wavelength of 460 nm the oxygenated arteries had a stronger signal than the de-oxygenated veins, and at a wavelength of 750 nm the de-oxygenated veins had a stronger signal than the oxygenated arteries. Thus, the ideal wavelength to reveal the oxygenated arteries was 460 nm, and the ideal wavelength to reveal the de-oxygenated veins was 750 nm. CONCLUSIONS: HSI is a prospective technique to assist with phlebotomy and non-contact oxygen saturation approach. Additionally, it may permit future surgical or pharmacological intercessions that titrate or limit ischemic injury continuously.","Fouad Aref, Mohamed Hisham; Sharawi, Amr A R; El-Sharkawy, Yasser H",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,365,10

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A single-center retrospective study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 1 through August 31, 2020 to evaluate whether outpatient insulin use, HbA1c, glucose on admission, or average glucose during admission was associated with intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation (ventilator) requirement, or mortality. RESULTS: Among 111 patients with DM, 48 (43.2%) were on outpatient insulin and the average HbA1c was 8.1% (65 mmol/mol). The average glucose on admission was 187.0±102.94 mg/dL and the average glucose during hospitalization was 173.4±39.8 mg/dL. Use of outpatient insulin, level of HbA1c, glucose on admission, or average glucose during hospitalization was not associated with ICU admission, ventilator requirement, or mortality among patients with COVID-19 and DM. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in a region with relatively low COVID-19 prevalence suggest that neither outpatient glycemic control, glucose on admission, or inpatient glycemic control is predictive of illness severity or mortality in patients with DM hospitalized with COVID-19.","Mehta, Paras B; Kohn, Michael A; Koliwad, Suneil K; Rushakoff, Robert J",,365,1

The adequacy of consultations was assessed with the Hospital Emergency Suitability Protocol (HESP). The correlation between the emergencies and the SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases was assessed with a generalized linear model. RESULTS: Although there was a decrease of almost 50% in ENT-ED visits during the first wave of COVID-19, the pattern of most cases remained similar to the pre-COVID-19 era: non-urgent consultations, not previously assessed by Primary Care (PC), being considered inadequate by the HESP.

Almost 4 million primary care practitioners (PCPs) participated in controlling the outbreak. However, PCPs' barriers to and experience of the epidemic control remain unknown and are essential for improving countermeasures. OBJECTIVE: To better understand the barriers PCPs faced in COVID-19 epidemic control and their psychological and occupational impacts, and explore potential solutions. DESIGN: This qualitative study was conducted through semi-structured, in-depth interviews from February 12, to March 10, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A purposive sample of frontline PCPs affiliated with either community health centers or township health centers in four provinces of China were recruited. APPROACH: Interviews were conducted by telephone, and then recorded, transcribed, and content analyzed. Themes surrounding PCPs' barriers to COVID-19 epidemic control, their experience, and potential solutions were iteratively identified using the constant comparative method. KEY RESULTS: Of the 21 PCPs interviewed, 10 (48%) were women and 5 (24%) worked in rural areas. Barriers to epidemic control in primary care included inappropriate PCP scheduling and role ambiguity, difficult tasks and inadequate capacities, and inexperienced community workers and insufficient cooperation. Some PCPs perceived respect and a sense of accomplishment and were preoccupied with the outbreak, while others were frustrated by fatigue and psychological distress. PCPs reported potential solutions for improving countermeasures, such as improving management, optimizing workflows, providing additional support, facilitating cooperation, and strengthening the primary care system. CONCLUSIONS: Due to their roles in controlling the COVID-19 epidemic, PCPs in China faced a series of barriers that affected them physically and mentally. Support for PCPs should help them to overcome these barriers and work efficiently. The current findings provide insight into the challenges and potential solutions for strengthening the preparedness and response of China's primary care system in future disease outbreaks.","Xu, Zhijie; Ye, Yuanqu; Wang, Yang; Qian, Yi; Pan, Jianjiang; Lu, Yiting; Fang, Lizheng",J Gen Intern Med,365,22

It completes organ morphogenesis in 7 h, between hatching 3 h after fertilization and the juvenile stage at 10 h, when it attains adult form and starts to feed. It has two types of mechanosensory cell embedded in the oral epithelium, which is a single layer of cells. There are twenty coronal sensory cells in the circumoral nerve ring and two dorsal sensory organ cells. Two bilateral lip precursor cells (LPCs), facing the anterior surface, divide dorsoventrally and make a wedge-shaped cleft between the two daughter cells named the dorsal lip cell (DLC) and the ventral lip cell (VLC). Eventually, the DLC and VLC become detached and separated into dorsal and ventral lips, triggering mouth opening. This is an intriguing example of cell division itself contributing to morphogenesis. The boundary between the ectoderm and endoderm is present between the lip cells and coronal sensory cells. All oral sensory cells, including dorsal sensory organ cells, were of endodermal origin and were not derived from the ectodermal placode. These observations on mouth formation provide a cellular basis for further studies at a molecular level, in this simple chordate.","Morita, Ryo; Onuma, Takeshi A; Manni, Lucia; Ohno, Nobuhiko; Nishida, Hiroki",Dev. genes evol.

During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, social restrictions imposed to reduce viral transmission limited access to social support, which is critical to postnatal psychological wellbeing - potentially intensifying RNT. Objective: We examined whether perceived social support (from friends, family, and a significant other) played a moderating role in the relationship between RNT and maternal postnatal anxiety and depressive symptoms. Methods: A sample of women (N = 251) who had given birth in the preceding 12 months completed an online battery of standardised measures during the COVID-19 'lockdown' of May 2020. Results: As predicted, social support moderated the relationship between RNT and depression such that the association between RNT and depression was stronger for women who reported lower levels of social support. Interestingly, this finding emerged for social support from friends only; for support from family and significant other, social support did not play a moderating role. Further, and unexpectedly, overall social support did not moderate the relationship between RNT and postnatal anxiety, however, social support from friends was a significant moderator. Conclusions: High levels of perceived social support from friends (but not family or significant others) buffered the effects of RNT on depression and anxiety during the postpartum period. Strategies to bolster peer social support may be a valuable inclusion in interventions to prevent and treat postnatal depression and anxiety.","Harrison, Virginia; Moulds, Michelle L; Jones, Katie",J Reprod Infant Psychol,365,30

However, the basic protection mechanisms and benefits of these masks remain controversial. Therefore, the aim of this work is to show from a fluid physics point of view under which circumstances these masks can protect against droplet infection. First of all, we show that the masks protect people in the surrounding area quite well, since the flow resistance of the face masks effectively prevents the spread of exhaled air, e.g. when breathing, speaking, singing, coughing and sneezing. Secondly, we provide visual evidence that typical household materials used by the population to make masks do not provide highly efficient protection against respirable particles and droplets with a diameter of 0.3–2 μm as they pass through the materials largely unfiltered. According to our tests, only vacuum cleaner bags with fine dust filters show a comparable or even better filtering effect than commercial particle filtering FFP2/N95/KN95 half masks. Thirdly, we show that even simple mouth-and-nose covers made of good filter material cannot reliably protect against droplet infection in contaminated ambient air, since most of the air flows through gaps at the edge of the masks. Only a close-fitting, particle-filtering respirator offers good self-protection against droplet infection. Nevertheless, wearing simple homemade or surgical face masks in public is highly recommended if no particle filtrating respiratory mask is available. Firstly, because they protect against habitual contact of the face with the hands and thus serve as self-protection against contact infection. Secondly, because the flow resistance of the masks ensures that the air remains close to the head when breathing, speaking, singing, coughing and sneezing, thus protecting other people if they have sufficient distance from each other. However, if the distance rules cannot be observed and the risk of inhalation-based infection becomes high because many people in the vicinity are infectious and the air exchange rate is small, improved filtration efficiency masks are needed, to take full advantage of the three fundamental protective mechanisms these masks provide.","Kähler, Christian J.; Hain, Rainer",J.

Facing this clinical condition, where the maintenance of the dentin-pulp complex vitality is imperative, is challenging in Dentistry. Dental pulp stem cells conditioned medium contains trophic factors that could help in this task. This in vivo pilot study aimed to evaluate the effects of the human dental pulp stem cells conditioned medium on the dental pulp tissue response to vital pulp therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Concentrated conditioned medium was obtained by incubating characterized human dental pulp stem cells with fresh culture medium. Pulp exposures performed at the first upper molars (n = 20) of Wistar rats were directly capped with: MTA or MTA + Conditioned Medium. Four and 8 weeks later, the samples were qualitatively analyzed in histological sections (H&E). RESULTS: When the conditioned medium was associated with MTA, there were a high percentage of samples presenting formation of dentin bridges and small percentage of pulp tissue with inflammatory signs in both experimental times. The conditioned medium improved the organization of the newly formed hard tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The association of dental pulp stem cell conditioned medium with MTA showed beneficial effects on dentin-pulp complex regeneration and has promising potential for studies in regenerative dentistry.","Sarra, Giovanna; Machado, Manoel Eduardo de Lima; Caballero-Flores, Héctor Valentin; Moreira, Maria Stella; Pedroni, Ana Clara Fagundes; Marques, Márcia Martins",Tissue Cell,365,19

Adults recovering from stroke or other brain trauma, who often have communication difficulties and other long-term challenges, are a population already at risk of isolation and lower quality of life. We investigated the impact of public health guidelines and related behavioral changes on self-perceptions of communication abilities and psychosocial factors in this population. Method The Stroke Comeback Center, a community-based center for stroke and other brain trauma survivors with communication impairments, disseminated an online survey to current members to investigate changes in communication, social engagement, and quality of life. Results Participants (N = 50) reported a number of changes in their day-to-day activities that reflect the current social distancing guidelines, such as reduced outings into the community and fewer in-person conversations with those living outside one's home. Overall, feelings of connectedness to others and overall quality of life were reported to be decreased when compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas receptive language abilities and technology skills were reported to have improved. Perhaps most interestingly, certain behavioral changes (including healthy movement activities and participation in virtual programs) had specific relationships with perceived communication abilities and social engagement. Conclusions Changes in daily life resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have had a tangible impact on self-perceived psychosocial elements (e.g., quality of life) and communication abilities among stroke and other brain trauma survivors. Clinicians and researchers may consider these perceived changes when engaging with this population as the effects of the pandemic continue and in the period of community re-entry that may follow.

In vivo activity of the combinations was tested in SCCHN cell line xenografts and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) animal models generated from patients with recurrent SCCHN. RESULTS: Western blot assay indicated that activation of EGFR, HER2, HER3, and c-Met was blocked by all three combinations and the downstream PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling pathways were inhibited. Sulforhodamine B colorimetric assay revealed SCCHN cell growth was more effectively inhibited by the combinations than by single agents, particularly in cell lines with high c-Met expression.

Especially the neoliberal myth as the only way of human progress, and technological development as the essence of social progress and main reason for scientific research. Among the significant revelations is the dismantling of the Welfare state and public health services, which render the population's vulnerability in the face of pandemics. Planetary devastation favors its emergence, and the correlation between the despondency of human activities and the (fleeting) improvement of planetary life, which denotes the radical incompatibility between the permanence of neoliberal capitalism that degrades everything and preservation and care of life in its infinite diversity, including human life! Another notion of human progress is proposed: the rise of values involved in the coexistence, and the spiritual, intellectual, and moral growth of the human condition in harmony with the planetary ecosystem. Regarding the deep reasons for the catastrophe, it is argued that it is humanity itself by its way of being, thinking, acting, living together and relating to the planet. Therefore, the conclusion reached is the urgent need to undertake an alternative path in the search for another possible world, hospitable and dignifying for all forms of life.","Viniegra-Velázquez, Leonardo",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,365,16

Indigenous peoples offer untapped potential for understanding how we are shaping resilient solutions to COVID-19 and similar threats in the future. In New Zealand, the Māori people occupy diverse leadership and occupational roles throughout society. As a result of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) they are recognised, through Acts of Parliament, as government partners who work in governance and planning processes, including the COVID-19 response. Such recognition can result in the inclusion of Māori values such as whanaungatanga (kinship and belonging), kaitiakitanga (environmental guardianship and responsibility) and manaakitanga (respect, care, and hospitality) within policy and Acts of Parliament. Māori leaders and spokespeople are stressing that environmental and social welfare needs of all communities should be prioritised as part of the COVID-19 solution and that tourism responses cannot be separated from social needs. Government responses and planning efforts that incorporate diverse cultural values ensure more equitable futures and positive experiences for tourism providers, travellers and the hosts. In this way Indigenous-informed approaches would positively contribute to transforming business, health and education for a more positive global society.","Carr, Anna",Tour. Geogr.,365,16

Methods: In the Sham group, the right sciatic nerve was exposed without clamping. The SNI model was established using the sciatic nerve clamp method on the right leg and then randomly divided into the SNI group and the Tuina group. Seven days after modeling, the Tuina group was treated daily with a ""massage and tuina manipulation simulator"" (Patent No. ZL 2007 0187403.1), which was used daily to stimulate Yinmen (BL37), Yanglingquan (GB34), and Chengshan (BL57) with point-pressing method, plucking method, and kneading method. The stimulating force was 4N, and the stimulating frequency was 60 times per minute; each method and each point were used for 1 minute, totaling 9 minutes (1 min/acupoint/method × 3 methods × 3 acupoints). Treatment was administered for 21 days, followed by a 1-day rest after the 10th treatment, for a total of 20 times of intervention. The sciatic function index (SFI) was used to evaluate the fine movements of the hind limbs of rats in each group. The ultrastructural changes at the point of nerve injury were observed by transmission electron microscopy, and the gene changes at the point of nerve injury were detected using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technology. Results: Compared with the baseline, the SFI of the SNI group and the Tuina group decreased significantly at the 0th intervention (7 days after molding); compared with the SNI group, the SFI of the Tuina group increased at the 10th intervention (P < 0.05) and increased significantly at the 15th and 20th intervention (P < 0.01). Compared with the Sham group, the myelin sheath integrity of the sciatic nerve in the SNI group was destroyed and the myelin sheath collapsed seriously, even forming myelin sheath ball, accompanied with severe axonal atrophy and mitochondrial degeneration. The tuina intervention could significantly improve the ultrastructure of the nerve injury point, and the nerve fiber myelin sheath in the Tuina group remained intact, without obvious axonal swelling or atrophy. Atrophic thread granules could be seen in the axon, but there were no vacuolated mitochondria. RNA-seq results showed that there were differences at 221 genes at the point of nerve injury between the Tuina group and the SNI group and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are enriched in the biological processes related to the regulation of myocyte. Regulations include the regulation of striated muscle cell differentiation, myoblast differentiation, and myotube differentiation. Conclusion: Tuina can improve the fine motor recovery and protect the myelin integrity in rats with peripheral nerve injury, and this is achieved by changing the gene sequence at the injured point.","Lv, Taotao; Mo, Yanjun; Yu, Tianyuan; Zhang, Yumo; Shao, Shuai; Luo, Yuting; Shen, Yi; Lu, Mengqian; Wong, Steven Gregory",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,365,16

A survey was conducted between April and July 2020 in four countries of the European Union-Estonia, Hungary, Portugal and Romania,-resulting in a relatively large sample of farmers (N = 421). The analysis was built on a semi-nonparametric approach. Approximately 19 percent of small-scale producers were able to increase sales during the first wave of the pandemic, although country-level variation was significant. Fruits and vegetables were by far the most popular products. The importance of specific channels varied across countries, but farm gate sales were among the most important marketing channels both before and during the first wave. The importance of channels that were based on digital resources and home delivery increased. Our evidence indicates that diversification was a strategy that paid off, both in terms of marketing channels and different product categories. However, the impact appears to be nonlinear; the initial advantage generated by diversification rapidly tapered off, either temporarily (in the case of products), or permanently (in the case of marketing channels). Later research may clarify whether these findings are generalizable in other socio-economic contexts, as well as in a non-COVID situation.","Benedek, Zsófia; Ferto, Imre; Galamba Marreiros, Cristina; Aguiar, Pâmela Mossmann de; Pocol, Cristina Bianca; Cechura, Lukás; Põder, Anne; Pääso, Piia; Bakucs, Zoltán",PLoS One,365,16

We conducted a prospective multi-center cross-sectional study to compare induced sputum to throat swabs for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Confirmed COVID-19 patients from six hospitals in six cities across China who received one or more negative RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled, and paired specimens (induced sputum and throat swabs; 56 cases) were assayed. In three paired samples, both the induced sputum and throat swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positive rate for induced sputum was significantly higher than for throat swabs both overall (28.6% vs 5.4%, respectively; p < 0.01). Patients were divided according to time span from onset of illness to sample collection into the more-than-30-day (n = 26) and less-than-30-day (n = 30) groups. The positive rate for induced sputum was also significantly higher than for throat swabs in the less-than-30-day group (53.3% vs 10.0%, respectively; p < 0.001). For the more-than-30-day group, all paired samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and heart rate remained stable during sputum induction and no staff were infected. Because induced sputum is more reliable and has a lower false-negative rate than throat swabs, we believe induced sputum is more useful for the confirmation of COVID-19 and is safer as a criterion for release from quarantine.","Lai, Tianwen; Xiang, Fangfei; Zeng, Jianfeng; Huang, Yingzi; Jia, Liping; Chen, Hui; Wu, Jiayuan; Xie, Jianfeng; Liu, Shuna; Deng, Wei; Zheng, Weiqiang; Huang, Yang; Zhang, Qinfu; Luo, Qingfeng; Mo, Fan; Long, Lieming; Zhang, Wuying; Chen, Wenna; Han, Huanqin",Virulence,365,23

Particularly worrisome are the high contagiousness of the virus and the saturation of hospitals' capacity due to overwhelming caseloads. Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as quarantine and inter-personal distancing are crucial to limiting the spread of the virus in the general population, but more tailored interventions may be needed at an individual level on a case-by-case basis. In this perspective, the most insidious situation is when an individual has contact with a contagious subject without adequate protection. If rapidly recognized afterwards, this occurrence may be promptly addressed through a post-exposure chemoprophylaxis (PEP) with antiviral drugs. This strategy has been implemented for other respiratory viruses (influenza above all) and was successfully used in South Korea among healthcare workers against the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, by providing people who were exposed to high-risk contacts with lopinavir-ritonavir plus ribavirin. Initial experiences with the use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 also seem promising.

To overcome this major public health crisis, an understanding of the transmission of the virus underlying this disease is of paramount importance. Evidence suggests that the most common route of transmission for the SARS-CoV-2 virus is likely via direct contact in person-to-person encounter with aerosol droplets. However, the possibility of transmission via contact with fomites from surfaces is a possible route of infection as well. Environmental contamination in rooms with COVID-19 patient has been widely observed due to viral shedding from both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Also, in hospitals, SARS-CoV-2 is known to survive on various surfaces for extended periods of time. Because repetitive contact cycles can spread the virus from one surface to the other in healthcare settings, here we evaluated contamination on different types of surfaces commonly found in healthcare settings.

Here, we describe recent extensions to the software and demonstrate the capabilities of the most recent version, SMOG v2.4. Changes include new tools that aid user-defined customization of force fields, as well as an interface with the OpenMM simulation libraries (OpenSMOG v1.0). To illustrate the utility of these advances, we present several applications of SMOG2 and OpenSMOG, which include systems with millions of atoms, long polymers and explicit ions. We also highlight how one can incorporate non-structure-based (e.g. AMBER-based) energetics to define a hybrid class of models. The representative applications include large-scale rearrangements of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, the HIV-1 capsid in the presence of explicit ions, and crystallographic lattices of ribosomes and proteins. In summary, SMOG 2 and OpenSMOG provide robust support for researchers who seek to apply structure-based models to large and/or intricate biomolecular systems.","Oliveira, Antonio B; Contessoto, Vinicius; Hassan, Asem; Byju, Sandra; Wang, Ailun; Wang, Yang; Rojas, Esteban G Dodero; Mohanty, Udayan; Noel, Jeffrey; Onuchic, Jose Nelson; Whitford, Paul Charles",,365,24

Second, we find that government accommodative policies to COVID-19 in other countries has a positive and statistically significant impact on the host country's consumer price index. Finally, the findings indicate that world food prices and oil prices positively affect the consumer price index.

Many factors were not known about The Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic because it is a novel human pathogen. One key factor that was not known in the earliest days of the pandemic was that many patients are either asymptomatic or have symptoms so mild that they may not seek medical attention and hence these patients would not be identified as a ""case"" if that term is defined as being sufficiently symptomatic to be seeking medical attention. Cases in the earliest days of the pandemic were defined as based on having symptoms (eg, fever, cough, respiratory distress) after ruling out other possible causes. Cases now are defined by tests confirming that the person is shedding the SARS-CoV-2 (ie, a laboratory vs. a symptomatic diagnosis). The mortality rate of this virus dropped as a function of this change. On the basis of the results of an unintended, naturalistic experiment on an expeditionary cruise in March of 2020, there was more than a 5-fold drop in the calculated mortality rate due to this definitional change in what constituted a case.

The prospective study included 2694 adults from the Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study. Face-to-face interviews using a seventy-nine-item FFQ were administered to assess habitual dietary flavonoid intake, while abdominal ultrasonography was conducted to evaluate the presence and degree of NAFLD, with measurements conducted 3 years apart. After adjustment for potential confounders, higher flavonoid intakes were gradely associated with reduced risks of worsen NAFLD status. The relative risks of worsening (v. non-worsening) NAFLD in the highest (v. lowest) quintile were 0·71 (95 % CI 0·54, 0·93) for total flavonoids, 0·74 (95 % CI 0·57, 0·95) for flavanones, 0·74 (95 % CI 0·56, 0·96) for flavan-3-ols, 0·90 (95 % CI 0·68, 1·18) for flavonols, 0·73 (95 % CI 0·56, 0·93) for flavones, 0·79 (95 % CI 0·61, 1·02) for isoflavones and 0·74 (95 % CI 0·57, 0·96) for anthocyanins. An L-shaped relationship was observed between total flavonoid intake and the risk of NAFLD progression.

METHODS: This study is a retrospective case series of adult and paediatric patients seen at dermatology clinics in Auckland, New Zealand. Information was collected on patient demographics, presentation, investigations and management. RESULTS: Thirteen cases (seven adults;six children) are included. The typical presentation of GP was erythematous or brown, scaly papules and plaques with desquamation in a predominantly flexural distribution. All patients reported recent exposure to BAC in laundry rinse solution. Nine biopsies were taken from four patients. Psoriasiform and eczematous findings were common on histopathology. The mainstay of treatment was cessation of BAC exposure. CONCLUSION: GP has a distinct clinical pattern although histopathological findings are varied. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for GP in patients presenting with erythematous flexural eruptions and seek a history of BAC exposure, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased antiseptic use.","Tian, C.

The SLED Family Reunification Program allows families in Sierra Leone, who did not know the final resting place of their loved ones, to be reunited with their graves and to bring them relief and closure. Continuing family requests in search of the burial place of loved ones five years after the end of the epidemic shows that the emotional burden of losing a family member and not knowing the place of burial does not diminish with time. As of February 2021, the Program continues and is described to allow its replication for other emergency events including COVID-19 and new Ebola outbreaks.","Bensyl, Diana; Bangura, Brima; Cundy, Sarah; Gegbai, Francis; Gorina, Yelena; Harding, Jadnah D; Hersey, Sara; Jambai, Amara; Kamara, Ansumana S; Kargbo, Alieya; Kamara, Mohamed A M; Lansana, Patrick; Otieno, Dan; Redd, John T; Samba, Thomas T; Singh, Tushar; Vandi, Mohamed A",Ann. epidemiol,365,16

Recent research has identified that the psychological well-being of NHS staff has been adversely impacted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to investigate narratives relating to the NHS and COVID-19 during the first lockdown (26 March-4 July 2020). A total of 123,880 tweets were collated and downloaded bound to the time period of the first lockdown in order to analyse the real-time discourse around COVID-19 and the NHS. Content analysis was undertaken and tweets were coded to positive and negative sentiments. Five main themes were identified: (1) the dichotomies of 'clap for carers'; (2) problems with PPE and testing; (3) peaks of anger; (4) issues around hero worship; and (5) hints of a normality. Further research exploring and documenting social media narratives around COVID-19 and the NHS, in this and subsequent lockdowns, should help in tailoring suitable support for staff in the future and acknowledging the profound impact that the pandemic has had.","McKay, Kathy; Wayland, Sarah; Ferguson, David; Petty, Jane; Kennedy, Eilis",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),365,29

It is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and the transmission is through the respiratory tract. Those infected may be asymptomatic, present typical symptoms (fever, dry cough and dyspnea), gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain) and viral RNA in stools. The objective of this work was to review the literature related to the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms, and to check the possibility of fecal-oral transmission. We searched PubMed® database on COVID-19 and gastrointestinal tract and selected articles using the PRISMA method. We eliminated articles based on titles and abstracts, small number of patients and the mechanism of infection, leaving 14 studies. Comorbidities and laboratory alterations (elevation of hepatic aminotransferases and bilirubin) were related to worsening of the disease. The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms ranged from 6.8% to 61.3%, including diarrhea (8.14% to 33.7%), nausea/vomiting (1.53% to 26.4%), anorexia (12.1% to 40.0%) and abdominal pain (0% to 14.5%). The presence of viral RNA in stools was rarely tested, but positive in 0% to 48.1%. The gastrointestinal tract is affected by COVID-19, causing specific symptoms, laboratory alterations and viral presence in the feces. However, the results of prevalence and possibility of fecal-oral transmission were varied, requiring further studies for more assertive conclusions. It is important that healthcare professionals draw attention to this fact, since these changes can help make diagnosis and initiate early treatment.","Almeida, Joana Ferro Machado de; Chehter, Ethel Zimberg",Einstein (Säo Paulo),365,33

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study on 61 COVID-19 patients (severe and non-severe; 33 men, age 63+/-15 years) who underwent a CT scan due to tachypnea, dyspnoea or desaturation. QCT was performed using VCAR software. Patients' clinical data was collected, including laboratory results and oxygenation support. The optimal cut-off point for CT parameters for predicting death and respiratory support was performed by maximizing the Youden Index in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: The analysis revealed significantly greater progression of changes: ground-glass opacities (GGO) (31,42% v 13,89%, p<0.001), consolidation (11,85% v 3,32%, p<0.001) in patients with severe disease compared to non-severe disease. Five lobes were involved in all patients with severe disease. In non-severe patients, a positive correlation was found between severity of GGO, consolidation and emphysema and sex, tachypnea, chest x-ray (CXR) score on admission and laboratory parameters: CRP, D-dimer, ALT, lymphocyte count and lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio. In the group of severe patients, a correlation was found between sex, creatinine level and death. ROC analysis on death prediction was used to establish the cut-off point for GGO at 24.3% (AUC 0.8878, 95% CI 0.7889-0.9866; sensitivity 91.7%, specificity 75.5%), 5.6% for consolidation (AUC 0.7466, 95% CI 0.6009-0.8923; sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 59.2%), and 37.8% for total (GGO+consolidation) (AUC 0.8622, 95% CI 0.7525-0.972; sensitivity 75%, specificity 83.7%). The cut-off point for predicting respiratory support was established for GGO at 18.7% (AUC 0.7611, 95% CI 0.6268-0.8954; sensitivity 87.5%, specificity 64.4%), consolidation at 3.88% (AUC 0.7438, 95% CI 0.6146-0.8729; sensitivity 100%, specificity 46.7%), and total at 23.5% (AUC 0.7931, 95% CI 0.673-0.9131; sensitivity 93.8%, specificity 57.8%). CONCLUSION: QCT is a good diagnostic tool which facilitates decision-making regarding intensification of oxygen support and transfer to an intensive care unit in patients severely ill with COVID-19 pneumonia. QCT can make an independent and simple screening tool to assess the risk of death, regardless of clinical symptoms. Usefulness of QCT to predict the risk of death is higher than to assess the indications for respiratory support.","Rorat, Marta; Jurek, Tomasz; Simon, Krzysztof; Guzinski, Maciej",PLoS One,365,20

With the increasing worldwide spreading of this disease, the lack of effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection makes the situation even more dangerous and unpredictable. Although many forces are speeding up to develop prevention and treatment therapeutics, it is unlikely that any de novo drugs will be available in months. Drug repurposing holds the promise to significantly save the time for drug development, since it could use existing clinic drugs to treat new diseases. Based on the “steric-clashes alleviating receptor (SCAR)” strategy developed in our lab recently, we screened the library of clinic and investigational drugs, and identified nine drugs that might be repurposed as covalent inhibitors of the priming proteases (cathepsin B, cathepsin L, and TMPRSS2) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Among these hits, five are known covalent inhibitors, and one is an anti-virus drug. Therefore, we hope our work would provide rational and timely help for developing anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.","Li, Qizhang; Wang, Zhiying; Zheng, Qiang; Liu, Sen",Comput. Struct. Biotechnol. J.,365,21

Mapping this health emergency in scientific publications demands multiple approaches to obtain a picture as complete as possible. To progress in the knowledge of this pandemic and to control its effects, international collaborations between researchers are essentials, as well as having open and immediate access to scientific publications, what we called ""coopetition"". Our main objectives are to identify the most productive countries in coronavirus publications, to analyse the international scientific collaboration on this topic, and to study the proportion and typology of open accessibility to these publications. We have analyzed 18,875 articles indexed in Web of Science. We performed the descriptive statistical analysis in order to explore the performance of the more prolific countries and organizations, as well as paying attention to the last 2 years. Registers have been analyzed separately via the VOSviewer software, drawing a network of links among countries and organizations to identify the starred countries and organizations, and the strongest links of the net. We have explored the capacity of researchers to generate scientific knowledge about a health crisis emergency, and their global capacity to collaborate among them in a global emergency. We consider that science is moving rapidly to find solutions to international health problems but access to this knowledge by society is not so quick due to several limitations (open access policies, corporate interests, etc.). We have observed that papers from China in the last 3 months (from January 2020 to March 2020) have a strong impact compared with papers published in years before. The United States and China are the major producers of documents of our sample, followed by all European countries, especially the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, and France. At the same time, the leading role of Saudi Arabia, Canada or South Korea should be noted, with a significant number of documents submitted but very different dynamics of international collaboration. The proportion of international collaboration is growing in all countries in 2019-2020, which contrasts with the situation of the last two decades. The organizations providing the most documents to the sample are mostly Chinese. The percentage of open access articles on coronavirus for the period 2001-2020 is 59.2% but if we focus in 2020 the figures increase up to 91.4%, due to the commitment of commercial publishers with the emergency.","Belli, Simone; Mugnaini, Rogério; Baltà, Joan; Abadal, Ernest",Scientometrics,365,16

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-three community-dwelling adults &#8805;65 years of age admitted for post-acute care from 2 SNFs from March 15, 2020, to May 30, 2020. MEASURE(S): COVID-19 status was determined from chart review. Frailty was measured with a deficit accumulation frailty index (FI), categorized into nonfrail, mild frailty, and moderate-to-severe frailty. The primary outcome was community discharge. Secondary outcomes included change in functional status from SNF admission to discharge, based on modified Barthel index (mBI) and continuous functional scale scored by physical (PT) and occupational therapists (OT). RESULTS: Among 73 admissions (31 COVID-19 negative, 42 COVID-19 positive), mean [standard deviation (SD)] age was 83.5 (8.8) and 42 (57.5%) were female, with mean FI of 0.31 (0.01) with no differences by COVID-19 status. The mean length of SNF stay for rehabilitation was 21.2 days (SD 11.1) for COVID-19 negative with 20 (64.5%) patients discharged to community, compared to 23.0 (SD 12.2) and 31 (73.8%) among patients who tested positive for COVID-19. Among those discharged to the community, all groups improved in mBI, PT, and OT score. Those with moderate-to-severe frailty (FI >0.35) had lower mBI scores on discharge [92.0 (6.7) not frail, 81.0 (15.4) mild frailty, 48.6 (20.4) moderate-to-severe frailty; P = .002], lower PT scores on discharge [54.2 (3.9) nonfrail, 51.5 (8.0) mild frailty, 37.1 (9.7) moderate-to-severe frailty; P = .002], and lower OT score on discharge [52.9 (3.2) nonfrail, 45.8 (9.4) mild frailty, 32.4 (7.4) moderate or worse frailty; P = .001].

The most striking immunopathology of advanced COVID-19 is cytokine release syndrome or ""cytokine storm"" that is attributable to the deficiencies in immune regulatory mechanisms. CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are central regulators of immune responses and play an indispensable role in the maintenance of immune homeostasis. Tregs are likely involved in the attenuation of antiviral defense at the early stage of infection and ameliorating inflammation-induced organ injury at the late stage of COVID-19. In this article, we review and summarize the current understanding of the change of Tregs in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and discuss the potential role of Tregs in the immunopathology of COVID-19. The emerging concept of Treg-targeted therapies, including both adoptive Treg transfer and low dose of IL-2 treatment, is introduced. Furthermore, the potential Treg-boosting effect of therapeutic agents used in the treatment of COVID-19, including dexamethasone, vitamin D, tocilizumab and sarilumab, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, adalimumab and tetrandrine, is discussed.

Current models suggest that low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) will have a similar incidence but substantially lower mortality rate than high-income countries. However, malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are prevalent in LMICs, and coinfections are likely. Both malaria and parasitic NTDs can alter immunologic responses to other infectious agents. Malaria can induce a cytokine storm and pro-coagulant state similar to that seen in severe COVID-19. Consequently, coinfections with malaria parasites and SARS-CoV-2 could result in substantially worse outcomes than mono-infections with either pathogen, and could shift the age pattern of severe COVID-19 to younger age-groups. Enhancing surveillance platforms could provide signals that indicate whether malaria, NTDs, and COVID-19 are syndemics (synergistic epidemics). Based on the prevalence of malaria and NTDs in specific localities, efforts to characterize COVID-19 in LMICs could be expanded by adding testing for malaria and NTDs. Such additional testing would allow the determination of the rates of coinfection and comparison of severity of outcomes by infection status, greatly improving the understanding of the epidemiology of COVID-19 in LMICs and potentially helping to mitigate its impact.","Gutman, Julie R; Lucchi, Naomi W; Cantey, Paul T; Steinhardt, Laura C; Samuels, Aaron M; Kamb, Mary L; Kapella, Bryan K; McElroy, Peter D; Udhayakumar, Venkatachalam; Lindblade, Kim A",Am J Trop Med Hyg,365,23

Pupillary responses were measured using a pupillometry system. Dynamic pupil parameters (i.e., pupil contraction amplitude, pupil dilatation latency, pupil contraction latency, pupil dilatation duration, pupil dilatation velocity, pupil contraction duration, pupil contraction velocity, resting pupil diameter [PD]) and static pupil parameters (i.e., mesopic PD, scotopic PD, high photopic PD, and low photopic PD) were registered. RESULTS: Although high photopic and scotopic PDs were significantly higher in patients recovering from COVID-19 than in healthy controls (P = 0.04 and P = 0.002), no statistically significant difference was found in mesopic and low photopic PD (P = 0.19 and P = 0.41). Regarding dynamic pupillometry parameters, resting PD and pupil contraction velocity (P = 0.04 and P = 0.02, respectively) were significantly higher in patients recovering from COVID-19 than in healthy controls (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively), whereas pupil dilatation latency and pupil contraction duration were lower in these patients than in healthy controls (P = 0.01 and P = 0.008, respectively). No significant differences in pupil contraction amplitude, pupil dilatation duration, pupil contraction latency, and pupil dilatation velocity were found between the study groups (P = 0.93, P = 0.91, P = 0.42, and P = 0.48, respectively). CONCLUSION: Pupil responses, which are controlled by the ANS, were impaired in patients recovering from COVID-19.

To interpret a learning outcome, researchers perform hypothesis testing for explainable features to advance scientific domain knowledge. In such a situation, testing for a blackbox learner poses a severe challenge because of intractable models, unknown limiting distributions of parameter estimates, and high computational constraints. In this article, we derive two consistent tests for the feature relevance of a blackbox learner. The first one evaluates a loss difference with perturbation on an inference sample, which is independent of an estimation sample used for parameter estimation in model fitting. The second further splits the inference sample into two but does not require data perturbation. Also, we develop their combined versions by aggregating the order statistics of the $p$-values based on repeated sample splitting. To estimate the splitting ratio and the perturbation size, we develop adaptive splitting schemes for suitably controlling the Type \rom{1} error subject to computational constraints. By deflating the \textit{bias-sd-ratio}, we establish asymptotic null distributions of the test statistics and their consistency in terms of statistical power. Our theoretical power analysis and simulations indicate that the one-split test is more powerful than the two-split test, though the latter is easier to apply for large datasets. Moreover, the combined tests are more stable while compensating for a power loss by repeated sample splitting. Numerically, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed tests on two benchmark examples.

A subgroup of patients participated in a survey to assess social determinants of health (SDOH) in the setting of a pandemic. Outcomes of those who participated in the survey, and those who did not participate were compared. Notably, those who were surveyed and lived within zip codes with low socioeconomic status had significantly decreased emergency department visits, which we defined as a discharge from the emergency department without hospitalization, as compared to those who did not receive outreach. Rates of inpatient hospitalization did not differ significantly. These findings suggest that patient outreach to evaluate SDOH during a pandemic leads to more appropriate emergency department and hospital resource utilization. This finding is particularly impactful given the current pandemic, which may place a strain on emergency department, and healthcare resources.","Austin, Scarlett Pappan Nikos Venkat Divya",Journal of Community Hospital Internal Medicine Perspectives,365,16

In this virus-cell interaction study, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection or viral spike protein expression alone inhibited angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor protein expression. The spike protein promoted an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) mediated signaling cascade, induced the transcriptional regulatory molecules NF-&#954;B and AP-1/c-Fos via MAPK activation, and increased IL-6 release. SARS-CoV-2 infected patient sera contained elevated levels of IL-6 and soluble IL-6R. Up-regulated AT1 receptor signaling also influenced the release of extracellular soluble IL-6R by the induction of the ADAM-17 protease. Use of the AT1 receptor antagonist, Candesartan cilexetil, resulted in down-regulation of IL-6/soluble IL-6R release in spike expressing cells. Phosphorylation of STAT3 at the Tyr705 residue plays an important role as a transcriptional inducer for SOCS3 and MCP-1 expression. Further study indicated that inhibition of STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation in SARS-CoV-2 infected and viral spike protein expressing epithelial cells did not induce SOCS3 and MCP-1 expression. Introduction of culture supernatant from SARS-CoV-2 spike expressing cells on a model human liver endothelial cell line (TMNK-1), where transmembrane IL-6R is poorly expressed, resulted in the induction of STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation as well as MCP-1 expression. In conclusion, our results indicated that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in epithelial cells promotes IL-6 trans-signaling by activation of the AT1 axis to initiate coordination of a hyper-inflammatory response.","Patra, Tapas; Meyer, Keith; Geerling, Lizzie; Isbell, T Scott; Hoft, Daniel F; Brien, James; Pinto, Amelia K; Ray, Ratna B; Ray, Ranjit",PLoS Pathog,365,23

The aim of our study was to analyze the effects of such intervention on the traumatological emergency service, with particular emphasis on variations in trauma incidence and patients' characteristics. Materials and Methods: An observational analysis was performed. Medical records were collected from 3 different trauma centers within a wide metropolitan area, and compared between 2 time periods: the full Italian lockdown period and the same period from the past year. The study population included all patients who were admitted to the Emergency Department (ED). For those who accessed for orthopedic reasons, the analyzed variables included the date of ED admission, age, gender, after visit discharge or hospitalization, place where the injury occurred, traumatic mechanism, diagnosis, relationship with sport activity, and time from injury/symptoms debut to ED access. Results: A total of 17591 ED accesses and 3163 ED trauma visits were identified. During the lockdown, ED trauma visits decreased by -59.8%, but required patient's hospitalization significantly more frequently. The rate of ED trauma admissions in the elderlies significantly increased, together with the proportion of fragility fractures such as hip fractures. Road accident traumas (-79.6%) and sport-related injuries (-96.2%) significantly dropped. Admissions for less-severe reasons such as atraumatic musculoskeletal pain significantly decreased (-81.6%). Conclusions: The lockdown reduced the pressure on the Health System in at least 2 ways: directly, by curbing viral transmission and indirectly, by more than halving the ED trauma visits. Nonetheless, we observed an increased proportion of traumas in older patients, requiring hospitalizations, while the rate of less-severe cases decreased. This analysis may raise awareness of the effects of a lockdown on trauma services and may be helpful for those ones around the world who are now facing the emergency.","Dolci, Andrea; Marongiu, Giuseppe; Leinardi, Lorenzo; Lombardo, Massimo; Dessì, Giuseppe; Capone, Antonio",Geriatr Orthop Surg Rehabil,365,14

However, the exact molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remain largely unknown. Methods: Genome-wide screening was used to establish intraviral and viral-host interactomes. Quantitative proteomics was used to investigate the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proteome signature in COVID-19. Findings: We elucidated 286 host proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 and >350 host proteins that are significantly perturbed in COVID-19-derived PBMCs. This signature in severe COVID-19 PBMCs reveals a significant upregulation of cellular proteins related to neutrophil activation and blood coagulation, as well as a downregulation of proteins mediating T cell receptor signaling. From the interactome, we further identified that non-structural protein 10 interacts with NF-&#954;B-repressing factor (NKRF) to facilitate interleukin-8 (IL-8) induction, which potentially contributes to IL-8-mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and the overexuberant host inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Our study not only presents a systematic examination of SARS-CoV-2-induced perturbation of host targets and cellular networks but it also reveals insights into the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers cytokine storms, representing a powerful resource in the pursuit of therapeutic interventions.

Inclusion criteria were patients with blunt and penetrating torso trauma without VS in the ED. Patients with head injuries, transfers from other hospitals, or those with missing values were excluded. The characteristics of survivors were evaluated, and statistical analyses performed.ResultsA total of 24,191 torso trauma patients without VS were evaluated in the ED and 96.6% were declared dead upon arrival. There were 246 survivors (1%), and 73 (0.3%) were eventually discharged home. Of patients who responded to resuscitation (812), the survival rate was 30.3%. Injury severity score (ISS), penetrating mechanism (odds ratio [OR] 1.99), definitive chest (OR 1.59) and abdominal surgery (OR 1.49) were associated with improved survival.

Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, but no vaccine is currently available. Interim safety and immunogenicity data about the vaccine candidate BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from trials in Germany and the United States. METHODS: In an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial conducted in the United States, we randomly assigned healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age and those 65 to 85 years of age to receive either placebo or one of two lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain; or BNT162b2, which encodes a membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike, stabilized in the prefusion conformation. The primary outcome was safety (e.g., local and systemic reactions and adverse events); immunogenicity was a secondary outcome. Trial groups were defined according to vaccine candidate, age of the participants, and vaccine dose level (10 µg, 20 µg, 30 µg, and 100 µg). In all groups but one, participants received two doses, with a 21-day interval between doses; in one group (100 µg of BNT162b1), participants received one dose. RESULTS: A total of 195 participants underwent randomization. In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 participants received vaccine and 3 received placebo. BNT162b2 was associated with a lower incidence and severity of systemic reactions than BNT162b1, particularly in older adults. In both younger and older adults, the two vaccine candidates elicited similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titers, which were similar to or higher than the geometric mean titer of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum samples. CONCLUSIONS: The safety and immunogenicity data from this U.S. phase 1 trial of two vaccine candidates in younger and older adults, added to earlier interim safety and immunogenicity data regarding BNT162b1 in younger adults from trials in Germany and the United States, support the selection of BNT162b2 for advancement to a pivotal phase 2-3 safety and efficacy evaluation.

XRD and TEM analyses revealed that phytosynthesized NiO NPs are crystalline in nature with a spherical shape having a mean particle size of 32.64 nm. TGA results indicated the presence of marine-derived organic constituents on the surface of NiO NPs. It is found that biogenic NiO NPs with BET surface area of 45.59 m2g-1 is a highly efficient catalyst for benign one-pot preparation of pyridopyrimidine derivatives using aqueous reaction conditions. This environmentally friendly procedure takes considerable advantages of shorter reaction times, excellent product yields (up to 96%), magnetically viable nanocatalyst (7 runs), low catalyst loadings, and free toxic chemical reagents.","Moavi, Javad; Buazar, Foad; Sayahi, Mohammad Hosein",Sci Rep,365,13

Evidence of the relationship between hemorrhage in R/M HNSCC and targeted therapies, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, or immune checkpoint inhibitors, is limited. We aimed to identify epidemiological and clinical data related to the occurrence of hemorrhage in R/M HNSCC and to explore its relationship with various therapies. We describe information obtained from literature searches as well as data extracted from a commercial database and a database from the author's institution (Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan). Evidence suggests that most bleeding events in R/M HNSCC are minor. Clinical trial safety data do not identify a causal association between hemorrhage and anti-EGFR agents or immune checkpoint inhibitors. In contrast, anti-VEGF agents are associated with increased, and often severe/fatal, hemorrhagic complications.","Bergamini, Cristiana; Ferris, Robert L; Xie, Jing; Mariani, Gabriella; Ali, Muzammil; Holmes, William C; Harrington, Kevin; Psyrri, Amanda; Cavalieri, Stefano; Licitra, Lisa",Head neck,365,20

However, the state-of-the-art performance of detecting such important objects (esp. small objects) is far from satisfying the demand of practical systems. Large-scale, rich-diversity, and high-resolution datasets play an important role in developing better object detection methods to satisfy the demand. Existing public large-scale datasets such as MS COCO collected from websites do not focus on the specific scenarios. Moreover, the popular datasets (e.g., KITTI and Citypersons) collected from the specific scenarios are limited in the number of images and instances, the resolution, and the diversity. To attempt to solve the problem, we build a diverse high-resolution dataset (called TJU-DHD). The dataset contains 115354 high-resolution images (52% images have a resolution of 1624×1200 pixels and 48% images have a resolution of at least 2, 560×1.440 pixels) and 709 330 labeled objects in total with a large variance in scale and appearance. Meanwhile, the dataset has a rich diversity in season variance, illumination variance, and weather variance. In addition, a new diverse pedestrian dataset is further built. With the four different detectors (i.e., the one-stage RetinaNet, anchor-free FCOS, two-stage FPN, and Cascade R-CNN), experiments about object detection and pedestrian detection are conducted. We hope that the newly built dataset can help promote the research on object detection and pedestrian detection in these two scenes.

The presented approach uses pool testing with a mix of pool sizes of various sizes. The test results are then combined to generate an accurate estimation over a wide range of infection probabilities. This method does not require an initial guess on the infection probability. We show that, using the suggested method, even a set of only $50$ tests with a total of only $1000$ samples can produce reasonable estimation over a wide range of probabilities. A measurement set with only $100$ tests is shown to achieve $25\%$ accuracy over infection probabilities from $0.001$ to $0.5$.

We conducted lidar measurements at Wuhan (30.53°N, 114.37°E) from October 2010 to June 2020 and analyzed the massive dataset with an automatic lidar processing algorithm, to investigate the long-term variations of aerosols. Lidar-derived total aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 532 nm shows an interannual decrease of −0.049 since 2010. Compared with AODs in other megacities worldwide, the AOD for Wuhan shows the largest decrease rate. After separating AOD contributions from boundary layer (BL) and free troposphere (FT), different evolution patterns are revealed with AOD decrease rates of −0.009 and −0.044 per year for FT and BL, respectively, which indicates more than 80% of AOD decrease are associated with reductions of local emissions. In addition, BL AOD was always larger than FT AOD before COVID-19 lockdown. However, this relation was conversed thereafter, with the lowest value of 0.125 for BL AOD since 2010, which is only the half of FT AOD within the same period. This feature corroborates strong influences of COVID-19 lockdown on human activities and local emissions. These findings can improve our understandings of regional aerosol responses to pollution controls and aerosol direct impacts on regional climate.","Yin, Zhenping Yi Fan Liu Fuchao He Yun Zhang Yunpeng Yu Changming Zhang Yunfei",Atmospheric Environment,365,26

After analyzing the regulatory networks of differentially expressed messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) between the different clinical stages, we found that humoral immunity and type I interferon response were significantly downregulated, while robust T-cell activation and differentiation at the whole transcriptome level constituted the main events that occurred during recovery from COVID-19. The formation of this T cell immune response might be driven by the activation of activating protein-1 (AP-1) related signaling pathway and was weakly affected by other clinical features.

One type of those commonly emerging and re-emerging pathogens are coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2). Wild animals are hosts of different coronaviruses with the potential risk of cross-species transmission. However, little is known about the reservoir and host of coronaviruses in wild animals in Qinghai Province, where has the greatest biodiversity among the world's high-altitude regions. Here, from the next-generation sequencing data, we obtained a known beta-coronavirus (beta-CoV) genome and a novel delta-coronavirus (delta-CoV) genome from faecal samples of 29 marmots, 50 rats and 25 birds in Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China in July 2019. According to the phylogenetic analysis, the beta-CoV shared high nucleotide identity with Coronavirus HKU24. Although the novel delta-CoV (MtCoV) was closely related to Sparrow deltacoronavirus ISU42824, the protein spike of the novel delta-CoV showed highest amino acid identity to Sparrow coronavirus HKU17 (73.1%). Interestingly, our results identified a novel host (Montifringilla taczanowskii) for the novel delta-CoV and the potential cross-species transmission. The most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of MtCoVs along with other closest members of the species of Coronavirus HKU15 was estimated to be 289 years ago. Thus, this study increases our understanding of the genetic diversity of beta-CoVs and delta-CoVs, and also provides a new perspective of the coronavirus hosts.","Zhu, Wentao; Yang, Jing; Lu, Shan; Lan, Ruiting; Jin, Dong; Luo, Xue-Lian; Pu, Ji; Wu, Shusheng; Xu, Jianguo",Virol. sin.

Through extensive experiments, the proposed approach not only achieves remarkable improvements over the state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of the individual's efficiency (arriving at 12.40%, 6.54% rise of income and utilization, respectively) and the platform's profit (reaching 4.59% promotion) but also reveals a time-varying fleet adjustment policy to minimize the operation cost of the platform.","Yang, Yue; Bao, Wencang; Ramezani, Mohsen; Xu, Zhe",,365,20

This is a particularly difficult task when a complex source, such as a seaport, is considered. COVID-19 epidemic has had a significant impact on environmental noise related to road, rail, air and ship traffic and provided a unique opportunity to observe immediate noise reduction. In order to identify the noise sources, whose reduction was most effective in reducing noise from the port area, this study compared and quantified noise emissions between the historical and epidemic periods. Environmental noise measurements from three noise monitoring stations at the port boundary were analysed. In addition, noise emissions from ship, road, rail and industry as well as meteorological data in the historical pre - COVID-19 (January 2018-February 2020) and COVID-19 (April 2020) period were analysed in detail. The characteristics of the noise sources mentioned, geographical data and noise measurements were used to develop and validate a noise model of the port area, which was used to calculate noise contour maps. Our results show that the reduction in noise levels observed at all monitoring stations coincides with the reduced shipping traffic. The A weighted equivalent sound pressure levels in the day, evening and night periods were reduced by 2.2â¯dB to 5.7â¯dB compared to the long-term averages, and the area of the 55â¯dB day-evening-night noise contour was reduced by 23%. Compared to the historical period, the number of people exposed to noise levels above 55â¯dB(A) in the day-evening-night period due to shipping and industrial activities was reduced by 20% in the COVID-19 period. Such results show that environmental noise generated by moored ships is a problem for port cities that should be regulated internationally. In addition, this paper provides precise guidance on noise emission characteristics, ship categorisation and the post-processing of long-term measurement data, taking into account wind conditions and undesired sound events, which can be applied to future research at other locations near shipping ports and used to prepare strategies for noise reduction in ports.","Curovic, Luka; Jeram, Sonja; Murovec, Jure; Novakovic, Tadej; Rupnik, Klara; Prezelj, Jurij",Sci Total Environ,365,24

We aimed at summarising the strength of evidence in the published literature on the association of physical and mental health with social connection via social isolation, living alone and loneliness. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search in April 2020 to identify meta-analyses using the Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases. The search strategy included terms of social isolation, loneliness, living alone and meta-analysis. Eligible meta-analyses needed to report any sort of association between an indicator of social connection and any physical or mental health outcome. The findings were summarised in a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Twenty-five meta-analyses met our criteria, of which 10 focused on physical health and 15 on mental health outcomes. The results suggest that lack of social connection is associated with chronic physical symptoms, frailty, coronary heart disease, malnutrition, hospital readmission, reduced vaccine uptake, early mortality, depression, social anxiety, psychosis, cognitive impairment in later life and suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS: The existing evidence clearly indicates that social connection is associated with a range of poor physical and mental health outcomes. A potential negative impact on these outcomes needs to be considered in future decisions on physical distancing measures.","Morina, Nexhmedin; Kip, Ahlke; Hoppen, Thole Hilko; Priebe, Stefan; Meyer, Thomas",BMJ Open,365,23

They are warning signs that loss is imminent. Long working hours are a risk factor for near-misses along with sleep problems, job-related stress, and depressive symptoms. This study aimed to evaluate the indirect effects of long working hours via mediating variables on near-miss occurrences among Japanese healthcare professionals. (2) Methods: 1490 Japanese healthcare professionals’ reports from a web-based survey of workers in October 2018 were analyzed to evaluate total, direct, and indirect effects of long working hours on near-misses. We applied a generalized structural equation model with three mediating variables: sleep problems, job-related stress, and depressive symptoms. (3) Results: The total effect and direct effect of the categories of working hours longer than 41 h per week (h/w) for occurrence of near-misses were not significantly higher than that of 35–40 h/w. However, for indirect effects on occurrence of near-misses that first passed through job-related stress, there were higher reports for each category compared to 35–40 h/w, with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of OR = 1.12, 95% CI (1.07, 1.21) for 41–50 h/w; 1.25, (1.14, 1.41) for 51–60 h/w; and 1.31, (1.18, 1.51) for ≥ 61 h/w. (4) Conclusion: The results suggest that reducing working hours might improve job-related stress, which could reduce near-misses and prevent injuries.","Anzai, Tatsuhiko; Yamauchi, Takashi; Ozawa, Masaki; Takahashi, Kunihiko",Int J Environ Res Public Health,365,27

Here we summarize nearly 14 years (2000–2013) of the most comprehensive data available (USFWS LEMIS system), involving 11 billion individual specimens and an additional 977 million kilograms of wildlife. The majority of shipments contained mammals (27%), while the majority of specimens imported were shells (57%) and tropical fish (25%). Most imports were facilitated by the aquatic and pet industry, resulting in one-third of all shipments containing live animals. The importer reported origin of wildlife was 77.7% wild-caught and 17.7% captive-reared. Indonesia was the leading exporter of legal shipments, while Mexico was the leading source reported for illegal shipments. At the specimen level, China was the leading exporter of legal and illegal wildlife imports. The number of annual declared shipments doubled during the period examined, illustrating continually increasing demand, which reinforces the need to scale up capacity for border inspections, risk management protocols and disease surveillance.

The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of oncological HCP and their patients has significant implications for oncological care. METHODS: HCP and patients with cancer at the Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna were included between 21 March and 4 June and tested for total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 employing the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. Reactive samples were confirmed or disproved by the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test. Additionally, a structured questionnaire regarding basic demographic parameters, travel history and COVID-19-associated symptoms had to be completed by HCP. RESULTS: 146 subjects (62 HCP and 84 patients with cancer) were enrolled. In the oncological HCP cohort, 20 (32.3%) subjects were medical oncologists, 28 (45.2%) nurses at our ward and 14 (22.6%) fulfil other functions such as study coordinators. In the patient cohort, most individuals are on active anticancer treatment (96.4%). 26% of the HCP and 6% of the patients had symptoms potentially associated with COVID-19 since the end of February 2020. However, only in 2 (3.2%) HCP and in 3 (3.6%) patients, anti-SARS-Cov-2 total antibodies were detected. The second assay for anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgG antibodies confirmed the positive result in all HCP and in 2 (2.4%) patients, suggesting an initial assay’s unspecific reaction in one case. In individuals with a confirmed test result, an active COVID-19 infection was documented by a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR test. CONCLUSION: Specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found solely in persons after a documented SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, thus supporting the test methods’ high sensitivity and specificity. The low prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in our cohorts indicates a lack of immunity against SARS-CoV-2. It highlights the need for continued strict safety measures to prevent uncontrolled viral spread among oncological HCPs and patients with cancer.","Fuereder, Thorsten; Berghoff, Anna Sophie; Heller, Gerwin; Haslacher, Helmuth; Perkmann, Thomas; Strassl, Robert; Berger, Julia Maria; Puhr, Hannah Christina; Kreminger, Judith; Moik, Florian; Schubert, Lorenz; Starzer, Angelika Martina; Steindl, Ariane; Winkler, Stefan; Preusser, Matthias; Tobudic, Selma",ESMO Open,365,26

One of the ethical duties for higher education faculty is to engage in effective teaching practices. As online higher education becomes increasingly popular, online faculty also bear this duty. Numerous studies have shown that character strengths cultivate ethical behavior. Hence, we sought to determine the relationship between character strengths and ethical engagement in online faculty. Specifically, we focused on intellectual character strengths, interpersonal character strengths, and emotional character strengths because of their relevance to online faculty’s teaching practices. Through correlational analyses, we learned that interpersonal and emotional character strengths were positively and moderately related to ethical engagement, whereas intellectual character strengths were weakly related to ethical engagement. The findings of this study provide insight into online faculty’s character strengths and ethical engagement. However, further research is needed to understand the role of character strengths and ethical engagement in promoting effective teaching practices in online higher education classrooms.","Or, Justina; Greenberger, Scott; Milliken, Melissa A.",J Acad Ethics,365,20

Here, we aim to develop a workflow to examine the association between structural alerts and drugs-induced ADs to improve toxicological prescreening tools. Considering reactive metabolite (RM) formation as a well-documented mechanism for drug-induced ADs, we investigated whether the presence of certain RM-related structural alerts was predictive for the risk of drug-induced AD. We constructed a database containing 171 RM-related structural alerts, generated a dataset of 407 AD- and non-AD-associated drugs, and performed statistical analysis. The nitrogen-containing benzene substituent alerts were found to be significantly associated with the risk of drug-induced ADs (odds ratio = 2.95, p = 0.0036). Furthermore, we developed a machine-learning-based predictive model by using daily dose and nitrogen-containing benzene substituent alerts as the top inputs and achieved the predictive performance of area under curve (AUC) of 70%. Additionally, we confirmed the reactivity of the nitrogen-containing benzene substituent aniline and related metabolites using quantum chemistry analysis and explored the underlying mechanisms. These identified structural alerts could be helpful in identifying drug candidates that carry a potential risk of drug-induced ADs to improve their safety profiles.","Wu, Yue; Zhu, Jieqiang; Fu, Peter; Tong, Weida; Hong, Huixiao; Chen, Minjun",Int J Environ Res Public Health,365,1

In contrast, the anosmia caused by other upper respiratory infections affects a small proportion of patients and may take months to resolve or never resolve. The mechanisms behind COVID-19-induced olfactory dysfunction remain unknown. Here, we address the unique pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated olfactory dysfunction. Methods The expression of ACE2 (virus binding receptor) and TMPRSS2 and Furin (host cell proteases facilitating virus entry) was examined in the nasal mucosa, composed of respiratory mucosa (RM), olfactory mucosa (OM), and olfactory bulb (OB) of mouse and human tissues using immunohistochemistry and gene analyses. Results Co-expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Furin was observed in the RM and in the OM, especially in the supporting cells of the olfactory epithelium and the Bowman’s glands. Notably, the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in the OM were positive for ACE2 but almost negative for TMPRSS2 and Furin. Cells in the OB expressed ACE2 strongly and Furin weakly, and did not express TMPRSS2. All three gene expressions were confirmed in the nasal mucosa and OB. Conclusions ACE2 was widely expressed in all tissues, whereas TMPRSS2 and Furin were expressed only in certain types of cells and were absent in the ORNs. These findings, together with clinical reports, suggest that COVID-19-related anosmia occurs mainly through sensorineural and central dysfunction and, to some extent, conductive olfactory dysfunction. The expression of ACE2, but not TMPRSS2 or Furin, in ORNs may explain the early recovery from anosmia.","Ueha, Rumi; Kondo, Kenji; Kagoya, Ryoji; Shichino, Shigeyuki; Ueha, Satoshi; Yamasoba, Tatsuya",bioRxiv,365,21

While the willingness to donate usually rises after other catastrophes such as earthquakes or terrorist attacks, a decline in the number of donors has been observed at the beginning of previous pandemics. Many donors fear infection or a weakening of their immune system and stay at home. Blood services find it difficult to organise the usual number of mobile donation appointments, which leads to a decline in donations. In the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, blood donations declined by more than 10% in many countries. Donors who continue to donate during a pandemic tend to be more experienced and already have an established donor identity. Many of these donors report that they want to contribute to overcoming the crisis. Thus, even during a pandemic, there is a high level of solidarity among blood donors. However, potential first-time donors are more likely to be deterred from donating by the uncertain conditions. Targeted recruitment strategies using social media channels are therefore needed to attract new donors. Initial findings among German blood donors suggest that current first-time donors have a high intention to return. To maintain the blood supply during a pandemic, the blood services should try to recruit first-time donors and quickly increase the number of their mobile donation appointments. Recruitment campaigns for experienced donors should reduce uncertainty and strengthen confidence in blood services. The greater the trust in the blood services, the lower the donorsʼ perception of risk. Alternative contact channels, such as messenger services, should also be tested.","Weidmann, Christian; Derstroff, Marie; Müller-Steinhardt, Michael",Transfusionsmedizin - Immunhämatologie · Hämotherapie · Transplantationsimmunologie · Zelltherapie,365,10

The TEAC values and total phenolic content for methanolic extracts of herbs ranged from 46.7 to 17,323 μmol Trolox equivalent/100 g dry weight (DW), and from 0.22 to 50.3 g of gallic acid equivalent/100 g DW, respectively. A positive, significant linear relationship between antioxidant activity and total phenolic content (all R(2) values≥0.95) showed that phenolic compounds were the dominant antioxidant components in the tested medicinal herbs. Major types of phenolic compounds from most of the tested herbs were preliminarily identified and analyzed, and mainly included phenolic acids, flavonoids, tannins, coumarins, lignans, quinones, stilbenes, and curcuminoids. These medicinal herbs exhibited far stronger antioxidant activity and contained significantly higher levels of phenolics than common vegetables and fruits.

A vaccine provides the best hope for a permanent solution to controlling the pandemic. However, to be effective, a vaccine must be accepted and used by a large majority of the population. The aim of this study was to understand the attitudes towards and obstacles facing vaccination with a potential COVID-19 vaccine. To measure these attitudes a survey was administered to 316 respondents across the United States by a survey corporation. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships of several factors with attitudes toward potential COVID-19 vaccination. Prior vaccine usage and attitudes predicted attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Assessment of the severity of COVID-19 for the United States was also predictive. Approximately 68% of all respondents were supportive of being vaccinated for COVID-19, but side effects, efficacy and length of testing remained concerns. Longer testing, increased efficacy and development in the United States were significantly associated with increased vaccine acceptance. Messages promoting COVID-19 vaccination should seek to alleviate the concerns of those who are already vaccine-hesitant. Messaging directed at the benefits of vaccination for the United States as a country would address the second predictive factor.

Consequently, strategies need to be explored to enable them to better maintain their competence. This article describes recent research investigating if nursing behaviours in the use of mobile technologies could be leveraged to better facilitate mobile learning. It addresses a gap in the existing literature around how nurses resource their own professional development and learning in the absence of appropriate learning resources in the workplace. METHODS: The research employed a classic grounded theory methodology which was conducted with 27 registered nurses from Public and Private Hospitals in Queensland and external postgraduate nursing students from Victoria, South Australia and the Northern Territory enrolled at the University of Southern Queensland. RESULTS: The Theory of Economising Learning describes how nurses maintain competence with limited resources. Unfavourable staffing levels and a fast-paced workplace mean that nurses rarely prioritise their professional learning while at work. Instead, it requires the nurse to contribute personal resources including time and money. Though the research revealed nurses were unconcerned about using mobile technologies, they were concerned about maintaining competence with limited resources. To counter this, nurses economised their learning by balancing personal resources against their motivation to maintain competence. The process of economising learning begins and ends with the development of the nurse’s personal curriculum in response to what they identify as being the most significant knowledge deficits at work that jeopardise their competence. A learning opportunity that addresses the knowledge deficit is sought. Nurses balance the opportunity to address the deficit against the cost of personal resources, to decide if they will engage with the opportunity and update their personal curriculum accordingly. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that workplaces need to create reasonable expectations within nurses to address knowledge deficits and provide the resources, including time, to allow them to do so without personal cost. It is also necessary for workplaces to moderate the flow of learning opportunities so as not to overwhelm and demotivate the nurses. Currently, nurses use several strategies to optimise their learning using mobile technologies which could be leveraged in the workplace.","Rees, Sharon; Farley, Helen; Moloney, Clint",BMC Nurs,365,16

Based on crystal structures of SARSCoV2 Mpro complexed with peptidomimetic inhibitors, we recognized a binding characteristic shared with proline-containing inhibitors of hepatitis C virus protease. Initial tests showed that this subclass of HCV protease inhibitors indeed exhibited activity against Mpro. Postulating a benefit for a preorganized backbone conformation, we designed new ketoamide-based Mpro inhibitors based on central proline rings. One of the designed compounds, ML1000, inhibits Mpro with low-nanomolar affinity and suppresses SARSCoV2 viral replication in human cells at sub-micromolar concentrations. Our findings identify ML1000 as a promising new pre-organized scaffold for the development of anti-coronavirus drugs.","Westberg, Michael; Su, Yichi; Zou, Xinzhi; Ning, Lin; Hurst, Brett; Tarbet, Bart; Lin, Michael Z.",bioRxiv,365,1

We found that 60.0% of the confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in places where the air temperature ranged from 5 °C to 15 °C, with a peak in cases at 11.54 °C. Moreover, approximately 73.8% of the confirmed cases were concentrated in regions with absolute humidity of 3 g/m3 to 10 g/m3. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be spreading toward higher latitudes. Our findings suggest that there is an optimal climatic zone in which the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 markedly increases in the ambient environment (including the surfaces of objects). These results strongly imply that the COVID-19 pandemic may spread cyclically and outbreaks may recur in large cities in the mid-latitudes in autumn 2020.","Huang, Zhongwei; Huang, Jianping; Gu, Qianqing; Du, Pengyue; Liang, Hongbin; Dong, Qing",Sci Total Environ,365,16

DESIGN: A cross‐sectional multicentre study. METHOD: Data collection took place from October 2017–April 2019, and the sample consisted of 365 participants from seven Brazilian hospitals. Demographic, clinical and therapeutic data were collected from the patients’ medical records. Data analysis was performed using bivariate and multivariate tests, considering a significance level of p<.05. RESULTS: Most patients were male, older adults, with high risk of death and highly dependent on nursing care. The LOS was associated with age, patient care complexity and length of NG/NET use. Death was associated with patient age. In the multivariate analysis, patients highly dependent on nursing care, and intensive and semi‐intensive care had a greater chance of dying when compared with patients receiving minimal care. Screening for factors affecting LOS and death is important to plan effective nursing care.","Freitas, Leticia Alves; Fagundes, Alex Luís; do Prado, Patrícia Rezende; Pereira, Marta Cristiane Alves; de Medeiros, Adriane Pinto; de Freitas, Ligia Menezes; Teixeira, Thalyta Cardoso Alux; Koepp, Janine; de Carvalho, Rhanna Emanuela Fontenele Lima; Gimenes, Fernanda Raphael Escobar",Nurs Open,365,5

Numerous studies have proposed to use Deep Learning techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, they have used very limited chest X-ray (CXR) image repositories for evaluation with a small number, a few hundreds, of COVID-19 samples. Moreover, these methods can neither localize nor grade the severity of COVID-19 infection. For this purpose, recent studies proposed to explore the activation maps of deep networks. However, they remain inaccurate for localizing the actual infestation making them unreliable for clinical use. This study proposes a novel method for the joint localization, severity grading, and detection of COVID-19 from CXR images by generating the so-called infection maps. To accomplish this, we have compiled the largest dataset with 119,316 CXR images including 2951 COVID-19 samples, where the annotation of the ground-truth segmentation masks is performed on CXRs by a novel collaborative human–machine approach. Furthermore, we publicly release the first CXR dataset with the ground-truth segmentation masks of the COVID-19 infected regions. A detailed set of experiments show that state-of-the-art segmentation networks can learn to localize COVID-19 infection with an F1-score of 83.20%, which is significantly superior to the activation maps created by the previous methods. Finally, the proposed approach achieved a COVID-19 detection performance with 94.96% sensitivity and 99.88% specificity.","Degerli, Aysen; Ahishali, Mete; Yamac, Mehmet; Kiranyaz, Serkan; Chowdhury, Muhammad E.

In this study, we discuss the research progress of TLC bioautography and then establish a definite timeline to introduce it. This review summarizes known TLC bioautography types and practical applications for determining antibacterial, antifungal, antitumor and antioxidant compounds and for inhibiting glucosidase, pancreatic lipase, tyrosinase and cholinesterase activity constitutes. Nowadays, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to identify original, natural products with anti-COVID potential compounds from Chinese traditional medicine and natural medicinal plants. We also give an account of detection techniques, including in situ and ex situ techniques; even in situ ion sources represent a major reform. Considering the current technical innovations, we propose that the technology will make more progress in TLC plates with higher separation and detection technology with a more portable and extensive scope of application. We believe this technology will be diffusely applied in medicine, biology, agriculture, animal husbandry, garden forestry, environmental management and other fields in the future.","Wang, Meng; Zhang, Yirong; Wang, Ruijie; Wang, Zhibin; Yang, Bingyou; Kuang, Haixue",Molecules,365,20

METHODS: We estimated per-day unit costs of COVID-19 case management for patients. We used a bottom-up approach to estimate full economic costs and adopted a health system perspective and patient episode of care as our time horizon. We obtained data on inputs and their quantities from data provided by three public COVID-19 treatment hospitals in Kenya and augmented this with guidelines. We obtained input prices from a recent costing survey of 20 hospitals in Kenya and from market prices for Kenya. RESULTS: Per-day, per-patient unit costs for asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease under home-based care are 1993.01 Kenyan shilling (KES) (US$18.89) and 1995.17 KES (US$18.991), respectively. When these patients are managed in an isolation centre or hospital, the same unit costs for asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate disease are 6717.74 KES (US$63.68) and 6719.90 KES (US$63.70), respectively. Per-day unit costs for patients with severe COVID-19 disease managed in general hospital wards and those with critical COVID-19 disease admitted in intensive care units are 13 137.07 KES (US$124.53) and 63 243.11 KES (US$599.51). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 case management costs are substantial, ranging between two and four times the average claims value reported by Kenya’s public health insurer. Kenya will need to mobilise substantial resources and explore service delivery adaptations that will reduce unit costs.","Barasa, Edwine; Kairu, Angela; Ng'ang'a, Wangari; Maritim, Marybeth; Were, Vincent; Akech, Samuel; Mwangangi, Mercy",BMJ Glob Health,365,23

But there is little such data for any elective surgery. The main objectives of this study were to examine the safety of bariatric surgery (BS) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to determine the efficacy of perioperative COVID-19 protective strategies on postoperative symptomatic COVID-19 rates. METHODS: We conducted an international cohort study to determine all-cause and COVID-19-specific 30-day morbidity and mortality of BS performed between 01/05/2020 and 31/10/2020. RESULTS: Four hundred ninety-nine surgeons from 185 centres in 42 countries provided data on 7704 patients. Elective primary BS (n = 7084) was associated with a 30-day morbidity of 6.76% (n = 479) and a 30-day mortality of 0.14% (n = 10). Emergency BS, revisional BS, insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, and untreated obstructive sleep apnoea were associated with increased complications on multivariable analysis. Forty-three patients developed symptomatic COVID-19 postoperatively, with a higher risk in non-whites. Preoperative self-isolation, preoperative testing for SARS-CoV-2, and surgery in institutions not concurrently treating COVID-19 patients did not reduce the incidence of postoperative COVID-19. Postoperative symptomatic COVID-19 was more likely if the surgery was performed during a COVID-19 peak in that country. CONCLUSIONS: BS can be performed safely during the COVID-19 pandemic with appropriate perioperative protocols. There was no relationship between preoperative testing for COVID-19 and self-isolation with symptomatic postoperative COVID-19. The risk of postoperative COVID-19 risk was greater in non-whites or if BS was performed during a local peak.

Maresins (MaR) are a family of essential fatty acid-derived lipid mediators that play a central role in the regulation of inflammation with several studies demonstrating that these mediators display protective activities in airway inflammation. Therefore, in the present studies we evaluated whether concentrations of these mediators were altered in both peripheral blood and nasal secretions from CRS patients. Herein, we focused on patients with CRS that also develop nasal polyps (CRSwNP), given that therapeutic options for the treatment of these patients are limited. Thereby, insights into disease mechanisms in these patients may help design more effective treatments. For this purpose, we compared maresin concentrations from CRSwNP patients with those found in healthy volunteers or patients with an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), as a self-resolving inflammatory condition. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we found that MaR concentrations were significantly decreased in plasma from patients with CRSwNP when compared to healthy volunteers. MaR concentrations were observed to be significantly upregulated in nasal secretions from patients with CRSwNP when compared with both healthy volunteers and URTI subjects. Concentration of these mediators in both plasma and nasal secretions from CRSwNP patients were positively correlated with quality-of-life scores in these patients. Assessment of the concentrations of other pro-resolving and pro-inflammatory lipid mediators (LM) demonstrated that there was a general shift in LM levels in both plasma and nasal secretions from CRSwNP when compared with healthy volunteers and URTI subjects. Of note, incubation of peripheral blood cells from CRSwNP patients with MaR1 downregulated the expression of activation markers on peripheral blood phagocytes, including CD41 and CD62P, markers of platelet-leukocyte heterotypic aggregates. Together these findings demonstrate that both local and systemic LM concentrations, in particularly those of the MaR family, become altered in patients with CRSwNP. They also suggest that therapeutics designed around MaR1 may be useful in regulating the activation of phagocytes in patients with CRSwNP thereby potentially also limiting the local inflammatory response in these patients.","Beegun, Issa; Koenis, Duco S.; Alusi, Ghassan; Dalli, Jesmond",Front Immunol,365,16

However, the disease presentation is nonspecific. The aim of this study was to define clearly the presentation, clinical progression, and laboratory data in a group of patients who had SARS. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: A tertiary care medical center with 51 negative-pressure isolation rooms in Taipei, Taiwan. PATIENTS: Fifty-three patients with SARS seen between April 27 and June 16, 2003. RESULTS: Fever (ie, temperature > 38°C) was the most common symptom (98%) and the earliest. When admitted to the isolation unit of the hospital for observation, most patients reported nonspecific symptoms associated with their fever. Only two patients with preexisting illnesses had cough on the same day the fever began. Eventually, 39 patients (74%) developed cough, beginning at a mean (± SD) time of 4.5 ± 1.9 days after fever onset, and 35 patients (66%) had diarrhea beginning at a mean time of 6.0 ± 3.3 days after fever onset. Thirty-one patients (59%) had abnormal findings on chest radiographs on hospital admission, and all but 1 patient (98%) eventually developed lung infiltrates that were consistent with pneumonia. The majority of patients (63%) first developed unifocal infiltrates at a mean time of 4.5 ± 2.1 days after fever onset, while in 37% of patients the initial infiltrates were multifocal, appearing at a mean time of 5.8 ± 1.3 days after fever onset. Common laboratory findings included lymphopenia (on hospital admission, 70%; during hospitalization, 95%), thrombocytopenia (on hospital admission, 28%; during hospitalization, 40%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (on hospital admission, 58%; during hospitalization, 88%), creatine kinase (on hospital admission, 18%; during hospitalization, 32%), and aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase levels (on hospital admission, 27%; during hospitalization, 62%). Throat or nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR was positive in 40 of the 47 patients (85%) in whom the test was performed. CONCLUSIONS: None of the presenting symptoms or laboratory findings are pathognomonic for SARS. Even though cough developed in a majority of patients, it did not occur until later in the disease course, suggesting that a cough preceding or concurrent with the onset of fever is less likely to indicate SARS. While PCR for SARS-CoV appears to be the best early diagnostic test currently available, it is clear that better methods are needed to differentiate between SARS and non-SARS illness on initial presentation.","Liu, Ching-Lung; Lu, Yen-Ta; Peng, Meng-Jen; Chen, Pei-Jan; Lin, Rong-Luh; Wu, Chien-Liang; Kuo, Hsu-Tah",Chest,365,28

Due to the high zoonotic potential of coronaviruses, it is critical to unravel their evolutionary history of host species breadth, host-switch potential, adaptation and emergence, to identify viruses posing a pandemic risk in humans. We present here a comprehensive analysis of the composition and codon usage bias of the 82 Orthocoronavirinae members, infecting 47 different avian and mammalian hosts. Our results clearly establish that synonymous codon usage varies widely among viruses, is only weakly dependent on their primary host, and is dominated by mutational bias towards AU-enrichment and by CpG avoidance. Indeed, variation in GC3 explains around 34%, while variation in CpG frequency explains around 14% of total variation in codon usage bias. Further insight on the mutational equilibrium within Orthocoronavirinae revealed that most coronavirus genomes are close to their neutral equilibrium, the exception being the three recently infecting human coronaviruses, which lie further away from the mutational equilibrium than their endemic human coronavirus counterparts. Finally, our results suggest that, while replicating in humans, SARS-CoV-2 is slowly becoming AU-richer, likely until attaining a new mutational equilibrium.","Daron, Josquin; Bravo, Ignacio G.",Viruses,365,1

Yet, perspectives and social opinions about it remain fractured, and collaborative action is faltering. Climate policy seeks to forge a singular sense of climate change, dominated by an ‘information deficit model’ that focuses on transferring climate science to the lay public. Critics argue that this leaves out certain perspectives, including the plurality of meanings uncovered through participatory approaches. However, questions remain about how these approaches can better account for nuances in the psychological complexity of climate change, without getting stuck in the cul-de-sacs of epistemological relativism and post-truth politics. In this paper, I explore an approach through which we might find shared meaning at the interface of individual and collective views about climate change. I first present a conceptual framework that describes five psychological reasons why climate change challenges individual and collective meaning-making, and also provides a way to understand how meaning is organized within that. I then use this framework to inform the use of photo voice as a transformative (action-research) method, examining its ability to overcome some of the meaning-making challenges specific to climate change. I discuss how participants from a coffee cooperative in Guatemala reflected first on their own climate meanings and then engaged in a meaning-making process with other actors in the coffee value chain. Findings suggest a psychosocial approach to climate engagement—one that engages both subjectively and intersubjectively on the complexities unique to climate change—is helpful in acknowledging an ontological pluralism of ‘climate changes’ amongst individuals, while also supporting a nexus-agreement collectively. This may in turn contribute to a more effective and ethical process of transformation.","Hochachka, Gail",Sustain Sci,365,9

With a substrate-binding domain (SBD) that binds to polypeptides and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) that can initiate extrinsic caspase-dependent apoptosis, csBiP may be a promising therapeutic target for COVID-19. This study aims to identify FDA-approved drugs that can neutralize viral binding and prevent viral replication by targeting the functional domains of csBiP. METHODS: In silico screening of 1999 FDA-approved drugs against the functional domains of BiP were performed using three molecular docking programs to avoid bias from individual docking programs. Top ligands were selected by averaging the ligand rankings from three programs. Interactions between top ligands and functional domains of BiP were analyzed. KEY FINDINGS: The top 10 SBD-binding candidates are velpatasvir, irinotecan, netupitant, lapatinib, doramectin, conivaptan, fenoverine, duvelisib, irbesartan, and pazopanib. The top 10 NBD-binding candidates are nilotinib, eltrombopag, grapiprant, topotecan, acetohexamide, vemurafenib, paritaprevir, pixantrone, azosemide, and piperaquine-phosphate. Among them, Velpatasvir and paritaprevir are antiviral agents that target the protease of hepatitis C virus. Netupitant is an anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits neurokinin-1 receptor, which contributes to acute inflammation. Grapiprant is an anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits the prostaglandin E(2) receptor protein subtype 4, which is expressed on immune cells and triggers inflammation. These predicted SBD-binding drugs could disrupt SARS-CoV-2 binding to csBiP, and NBD-binding drugs may falter viral attachment and replication by locking the SBD in closed conformation and triggering apoptosis in infected cells. SIGNIFICANCE: csBiP appears to be a novel therapeutic target against COVID-19 by preventing viral attachment and replication. These identified drugs could be repurposed to treat COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, Yiming; Greer, Rory A; Song, Yuwei; Praveen, Hrithik; Song, Yuhua",Eur J Pharm Sci,365,20

A cohort study was performed during the first (wave 1; W1) and second (wave 2; W2) waves of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The total sample included 231 university students, of which 59.31% were women. The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS) were included in one online survey. Stress, emotion-oriented, and avoidance-oriented coping styles increased from W1 to W2 of the COVID-19 pandemic, while life satisfaction and task-oriented coping decreased. The partial mediation effect of all three coping styles during W1 and W2 (in a cross-sectional approach) on the relationship between perceived stress and life satisfaction was confirmed in this study. The task-oriented and avoidance-oriented coping styles can play a mediating role in the reciprocal relationship between life satisfaction and perceived stress during W1 and W2 of the pandemic. There were no mutual interactions between stress and life satisfaction from a longitudinal approach. Coping styles changed subsequently due to stressful environmental changes related to lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Having a wide range of coping strategies from which to choose during an unstable situation should help manage stress and well-being.","Rogowska, Aleksandra Maria; Kuśnierz, Cezary; Ochnik, Dominika",J Clin Med,365,12

We report the results of a follow-up evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 148 convalescent plasma donors who participated in a phase 2 study at a median of 8.3 months (range 6.8-10.5 months) post first symptom onset. Monitoring responses over time, we found contraction of antibody responses for all four antigens tested, with Spike antibodies showing higher persistence than Nucleocapsid antibodies. A piecewise linear random-effects multivariate regression analysis showed a bi-phasic antibody decay with a more pronounced decrease during the first 6 months post symptoms onset by analysis of two intervals. Interestingly, antibodies to Spike showed better longevity whereas their neutralization ability contracted faster. As a result, neutralizing antibodies were detected in only 76% of patients at the last time point. In a multivariate analysis, older age and hospitalization were independently associated with higher Spike, Spike-RBD, Nucleocapsid, N-RBD antibodies and neutralizing antibody levels. Results on persistence and neutralizing ability of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, especially against Spike and Spike-RBD, should be considered in the design of future vaccination strategies.","Terpos, Evangelos; Stellas, Dimitris; Rosati, Margherita; Sergentanis, Theodoros N.; Hu, Xintao; Politou, Marianna; Pappa, Vassiliki; Ntanasis-Stathopoulos, Ioannis; Karaliota, Sevasti; Bear, Jenifer; Donohue, Duncan; Pagoni, Maria; Grouzi, Elisavet; Korompoki, Eleni; Pavlakis, George N.; Felber, Barbara K.; Dimopoulos, Meletios A.",Eur J Intern Med,365,3

The conventional ways of assessment are now neither possible nor practical for certifying medical graduates. This has necessitated thoughtful considerations in making adjustments to the assessment system, with most institutions transitioning to online assessments that so far have remained underutilized. Programmatic assessment encourages the deliberate and longitudinal use of diverse assessment methods to maximize learning and assessment and at present can be utilized optimally as it ensures the collection of multiple low-stake assessment data which can be aggregated for high-stake pass/fail decisions by making use of every opportunity for formative feedback to improve performance. Though efforts have been made to introduce programmatic assessment in the competency-based undergraduate curriculum, transitioning to online assessment can be a potential opportunity if the basic tenets of programmatic assessment, choice of online assessment tools, strategies, good practices of online assessments and challenges are understood and explored explicitly for designing and implementing online assessments.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective study to compare reinforced education using Wechat with care as usual from February to December 2019. Patients in the reinforced education group received reinforced education via Wechat, while those in the control group received care as usual. Effect measurements for both groups are carried out with questionnaires at the baseline and 3 days later. Questionnaires include pain intensity (NRS), treatment-related adverse events, cancer-related quality of life (QOL), sleep (PSQI), satisfaction, anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9). Number of patients whose NRS reduced to less than three points in 24 h was the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included treatment-related adverse events, cancer-related quality of life, sleep, satisfaction, anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Although there was no significant difference regarding pain intensity (NRS) between the two groups at 72 h, the rate of NRS that reduced to less than three points in 24 h was significantly higher in the Wechat group than in the control group. Patients’ satisfaction was significantly higher in the Wechat group than in the control group. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the other findings at 72 h, including pain intensity (NRS), cancer-related quality of life (QOL), anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and sleep (PSQI). However, no significant difference was found between the two groups for constipation, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, somnolence, pruritus, loss of consciousness, and death.

Sleep problems have been demonstrated by scattered evidence among the current literature on COVID‐19; however, little is known regarding the synthesised prevalence of sleep problems (i.e. insomnia symptoms and poor sleep quality) for males and females separately. The present systematic review and meta‐analysis aimed to answer the important question regarding prevalence of sleep problems during the COVID‐19 outbreak period between genders. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guideline and Newcastle–Ottawa Scale checklist, relevant studies with satisfactory methodological quality searched for in five academic databases (Scopus, PubMed Central, ProQuest, Web of Science , and EMBASE) were included and analysed. The protocol of the project was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; identification code CRD42020181644). A total of 54 papers (N = 67,722) in the female subgroup and 45 papers (N = 45,718) in the male subgroup were pooled in the meta‐analysis. The corrected pooled estimated prevalence of sleep problems was 24% (95% confidence interval [CI] 19%–29%) for female participants and 27% (95% CI 24%–30%) for male participants. Although in both gender subgroups, patients with COVID‐19, health professionals and general population showed the highest prevalence of sleep problems, it did not reach statistical significance.

The following variables were extracted for this study: age, gender, temperature, and saturation of oxygen on admission, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, heparin, steroids, tocilizumab, a combination of lopinavir with ritonavir, and oseltamivir, together with data on mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations. At the time of collecting the data, 301 patients had died, 1449 had been discharged home from the hospitals, 240 were still admitted, and 85 had been transferred to hospitals not included in the study. Median follow-up time was 8 (IQR 5–12) days. Hydroxychloroquine had been used in 1857 patients. Hydroxychloroquine was associated with lower mortality when the model was adjusted for age and gender, with OR (95% CI): 0.44 (0.29–0.67). This association remained significant when saturation of oxygen < 90% and temperature > 37 °C were added to de model with OR 0.45 (0.30–0.68) p < 0.001, and also when all the other drugs, and time of admission, were included as covariates. The association between hydroxychloroquine and lower mortality observed in this study can be acknowledged by clinicians in hospitals and in the community.

There have been numerous surveys published that have suggested that insomnia has increased during the pandemic. However, there have been no comparisons of data from the pandemic with that from other years. Here we present baseline data from people signing up to an online CBTi course to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on sleep. METHODS: We investigated the difference in age; diary-reported Sleep Efficiency (SE%) and Total Sleep Time (TST); sleep quality and disturbances as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and daytime sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS); between the first wave of COVID-19 in the UK (1st March -31st July 2020) as compared to the same period in 2019. RESULTS: In 2019 n=2231 patients were assessed as compared to n=6173 in 2020. There were no significant differences in the age of the two cohorts (47.1 years v 46.3 years, NS). SE% was significantly lower in the 2019 cohort (66% v 67.6, p <0.001) as was their total sleep time (5.71 hrs v 6.05 hrs, p<0.0001). PSQI scores were also higher in 2019 (13.13 v 12.72. p<0.0001). The level of daytime sleepiness was lower in the 2019 cohort (5.4 v 5.6 p <0.001) CONCLUSION: Our results show that there was no evidence of an increase in the severity of sleep disturbance during the 1st wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK in contrast to what numerous surveys have suggested. Indeed, we found that people signing up to Sleepstation’s online dCBTi course during the 1st wave of the pandemic had statistically significant better subjective sleep, although they had a higher level of daytime sleepiness than those in the same period a year previously. Although statistically significant, our results do not demonstrate a clinically relevant difference between the two cohorts. It is also interesting that despite the age-related impact of COVID-19, there was no significant difference in the age of the patients. Thus, in contrast to the survey data, we found no evidence for a worsening of sleep during the 1st wave of the pandemic.

Travel cost and time off work may create additional barriers for patients living remotely. Implementing telehealth can alleviate these barriers by reducing office visits. The aim of this study was to evaluate patient satisfaction with telehealth during ART. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey and retrospective cohort study. Patients living remotely who underwent ART utilizing telehealth between 2015 and 2018 at a single institution were selected for the telehealth group. The non-telehealth control group included randomly selected patients who underwent IVF at the same institution between 2015 and 2018. Demographic variables and treatment outcomes were obtained for both groups. A patient satisfaction questionnaire was distributed to telehealth patients. Statistical analysis using χ(2) test was performed to compare ART outcomes between both groups. RESULTS: Ninety-seven control and 97 telehealth patients were included. For telehealth patients, the mean number of office visits and distance traveled was 2.9 (± 0.8 SD) and 143.1 miles (± 49.2 SD) respectively. 58.8% of patients completed the survey. 44/57 participants had an oocyte retrieval and 42/44 underwent embryo transfer. For those who completed the survey, the clinical pregnancy rate was 31/44 and the live birth rate was 25/44. There was no difference in treatment outcomes between telehealth compared to controls. 73% of patients were highly satisfied with telehealth. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth can improve access to ART in underserved areas and results in high patient satisfaction.

On logistic regression analysis, the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and BMI category progression was statistically significant [fully adjusted OR 2.14 (95% CI, 1.18–3.90; p = 0.013)]. CONCLUSION: In this longitudinal study, predominant mild/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increase in BMI, but not with worsening of beta cell function and insulin resistance, nor glycemic progression.","Goyal, Alpesh; Gupta, Yashdeep; Kalaivani, Mani; Bhatla, Neerja; Tandon, Nikhil",Diabetes Ther,365,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relevant studies were searched in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases until March 31, 2020. Cochrane's Q test and the I(2) statistic were used to determine heterogeneity. We used the random-effect models to pool the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). KEY FINDINGS: Out of a total of 8557 initial records, 44 articles (50 studies) with 7865 patients (ranging from 13 to 1582), were included. Our meta-analyses with random-effect models showed a significant decrease in lymphocytes, monocyte, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD3 cells, CD19 cells, and natural killer (NK) cells and an increase in the white blood cell (WBC), neutrophils, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP)/hs-CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), ferritin, procalcitonin (PCT), and serum amyloid A (SAA), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-2R, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (INF-γ) in the severe group compared to the non-severe group. However, no significant differences were found in IL-1β, IL-17, and CD4/CD8 T cell ratio between the two groups. SIGNIFICANCE: Decrease in total lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets as well as the elevation of CRP, ESR, SAA, PCT, ferritin, and cytokines, but not IL-1β and IL-17, were closely associated with COVID-19 severity, implying reliable indicators of severe COVID-19.","Akbari, Hamed; Tabrizi, Reza; Lankarani, Kamran B.; Aria, Hamid; Vakili, Sina; Asadian, Fatemeh; Noroozi, Saam; Keshavarz, Pedram; Faramarz, Sanaz",Life Sci,365,16

We propose that this relation is due to differential information shared by political parties rather than values associated with face mask wearing. We further propose that, when assessed together, political party affiliation (e.g., Republican, Democrat) but not political ideology (e.g., conservative, liberal) predicts face mask wearing, and this effect is mediated by perceptions of efficacy doubts but not perceptions that face masks infringe upon the wearer's independence. We performed a three-wave, time-separated survey study with 226 participants. Each proposal was supported. When assessed together, political party affiliation but not political ideology significantly predicted face mask wearing, and a significant indirect effect was observed via perceptions of efficacy doubts but not independence. Our results support that face mask wearing is a unique preventative action, which should be understood using political theory.","Howard, Matt C",International journal of psychology : Journal international de psychologie,365,12

As critical members of human capital in the health sector, medical students with specialized knowledge and skills have positively fought against the epidemic by providing volunteer services that boosted the resilience of the health system. Although volunteer behavior (VB) is associated with individual internal motivation, there is sparse evidence on this relationship among medical students, especially regarding potential mechanisms. Therefore, this study had two main objectives: (1) to examine the influence of prosocial motivation (PM) of medical students on their VB; and (2) to verify the chain-mediating role of calling and vocation (CV) as well as social responsibility (SR) in the relationship between PM and VB. Study I: a total of 2454 Chinese full-time medical students were invited to complete an online survey. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and multiple linear regression analysis. The results demonstrated that PM significantly affected VB in medical students (β = 0.098, P < 0.001); CV as well as SR chain-mediated the relationship between PM and VB (β = 0.084, P < 0.001). PM promoted the formation of SR by positively evoking CV of medical students, further resulting in increased VB. Study II: A 28 person qualitative interview was conducted. Qualitative data are added to reduce the limitations of online questionnaires. At the same time, we can also critically study the VB of Chinese medical students during COVID-19. The results showed that there were various reasons for medical students to volunteer in the process of fighting against COVID-19, and the experience of volunteer service and the impact on their future life were different. Lastly, the current findings suggest that fostering volunteerism among medical students requires the joint effort of the government, non-profit organizations, and medical colleges.","Shi, Yu; Zhang, Shu-e; Fan, Lihua; Sun, Tao",Front Psychol,365,1

A traditional TSR modified by using susceptible-infectious-recovery models and distribution lag nonlinear model was applied to estimate the short-term effects of daily environmental factors on children HFMD occurrence in 2014–2018 with adjustment of potential confounding factors. A total of 70,027 children aged 0–15 years with HFMD were enrolled. No significant effect was observed for daily sunspot numbers and average visibility. We found positive effects of the ambient average temperature, with an approximately m-shaped curve of the overall cumulative relationship, peaking at 25.6 °C with a relative risk (RR) of 1.45 (95% confidence intervals 1.21–1.73). The largest RR value of hot effect was achieved on the current day and then decreased by 2 days (total group, male group, and scatter group) or 1 day (female group and nursery group), and the effect lasted about 6 to 8 days from the lag 4 or lag 6 day. A greater association of temperature with HFMD for the female group and the scattered group was observed. This study suggests that ambient average temperature might be a risk factor for children HFMD in Tianjin.

To assess whether this impaired our ability to detect and control early introductions of the virus into the UK, we PCR-tested archival specimens collected on admission to a large UK teaching hospital who retrospectively were identified as having a clinical presentation compatible with COVID-19. In addition, we screened available archival specimens submitted for respiratory virus diagnosis, and dating back to early January 2020, for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our data provides evidence for widespread community circulation of SARS-CoV2 in early February 2020 and into March that was undetected at the time due to restrictive case definitions informing testing policy. Genome sequence data showed that many of these early cases were infected with a distinct lineage of the virus. Sequences obtained from the first officially recorded case in Nottinghamshire - a traveller returning from Daegu, South Korea - also clustered with these early UK sequences suggesting acquisition of the virus occurred in the UK and not Daegu. Analysis of a larger sample of sequences obtained in the Nottinghamshire area revealed multiple viral introductions, mainly in late February and through March. These data highlight the importance of timely and extensive community testing to prevent future widespread transmission of the virus.","Chappell, J.

A 43-year-old man presented to our hospital with a complaint of fever, for which he was diagnosed with COVID-19 after a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and antiviral therapy with favipiravir and ciclesonide was started subsequently. The fever persisted for the first few days of treatment, but his respiratory status was stable, and he became asymptomatic and afebrile on day 9. Although the PCR tests remained positive, he met the updated discharge criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO) on day 12. However, his fever recurred, and his condition worsened on day 16. A chest X-ray showed a new opacity. It is likely that favipiravir and ciclesonide treatment probably did not completely eliminate the virus in the patient, and therefore the infection persisted. We added remdesivir from day 21, and the improvement was remarkable. He was discharged on day 29 after two consecutive PCR test results were negative. PCR tests are not mandatory for the updated WHO discharge criteria. However, even after antiviral therapy, COVID-19 patients with hematologic malignancies may have prolonged active infection with impaired viral excretion. Depending on the background disease and comorbidities, there may be some patient populations for whom it is not appropriate to simply comply with the current discharge criteria. Therefore, more emphasis may be needed on PCR examinations.","Fujii, Hiroyuki; Tsuji, Taisuke; Sugitani, Mio; Matsumoto, Yosuke; Yuba, Tatsuya; Tanaka, Shunya; Suga, Yoshifumi; Matsuyama, Aosa; Goda, Shiho; Omura, Ayaka; Shiotsu, Shinsuke; Takumi, Chieko; Ono, Seiko; Hiraoka, Noriya",Curr Probl Cancer,365,32

The objective of this study was to assess the characteristics and ouctome of ICU-acquired infections in COVID-19 patients. We conducted a retrospective single-centre, case-control study including 140 patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to the ICU between March and May 2020. We evaluated the epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological features, and outcome of ICU-acquired infections. Fifty-seven patients (40.7%) developed a bacterial or fungal nosocomial infection during ICU stay. Infection occurred after a median of 9 days (IQR 5–11) of admission and was significantly associated with the APACHE II score (p = 0.02). There were 91 episodes of infection: primary (31%) and catheter-related (25%) bloodstream infections were the most frequent, followed by pneumonia (23%), tracheobronchitis (10%), and urinary tract infection (8%) that were produced by a wide spectrum of Gram-positive (55%) and Gram-negative bacteria (30%) as well as fungi (15%). In 60% of cases, infection was associated with septic shock and a significant increase in SOFA score. Overall ICU mortality was 36% (51/140). Infection was significantly associated with death (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2–5.9, p = 0.015) and a longer ICU stay (p < 0.001). Bacterial and fungal nosocomial infection is a common complication of ICU admission in patients with COVID-19. It usually presents as a severe form of infection, and it is associated with a high mortality and longer course of ICU stay.

Methods: Accessible national data of daily admissions and deaths were collected from 1 April 2020 to 22 May 2021. Google Community Mobility Report (CMR) data were downloaded for the same period. Among six CMR categories, three were used and reduced to one index—the community mobility index (CMI). We used a generalised linear model with a negative binomial distribution combined with a non-linear distributed lag model to investigate the short-term effects of CMI on the number of admitted PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths, controlling for public holidays, day of the week, and Eid/Ramadan days. Results: We demonstrated the feasibility of using CMRs in the evaluation and monitoring of different NPIs, particularly those related to movement restriction. The best movement restriction strategy was a curfew from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. (level 3 of CMI = 8), which had a total reduction of 35% (95% confidence interval (CI); 25–44%) in new COVID-19 admissions in the following two weeks, and a fatality reduction in the following four weeks by 52% (95% CI; 11–75%).

Compared to nucleic acid tests (NATs), antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) can be more accessible, but typically have lower sensitivity and specificity. By quantifying these trade-offs, we aimed to inform decisions about when an Ag-RDT would offer greater public health value than reliance on NAT. METHODS: Following an expert consultation, we selected two use cases for analysis: rapid identification of people with COVID-19 amongst patients admitted with respiratory symptoms in a ‘hospital’ setting and early identification and isolation of people with mildly symptomatic COVID-19 in a ‘community’ setting. Using decision analysis, we evaluated the health system cost and health impact (deaths averted and infectious days isolated) of an Ag-RDT-led strategy, compared to a strategy based on NAT and clinical judgement. We adopted a broad range of values for ‘contextual’ parameters relevant to a range of settings, including the availability of NAT and the performance of clinical judgement. We performed a multivariate sensitivity analysis to all of these parameters. RESULTS: In a hospital setting, an Ag-RDT-led strategy would avert more deaths than a NAT-based strategy, and at lower cost per death averted, when the sensitivity of clinical judgement is less than 90%, and when NAT results are available in time to inform clinical decision-making for less than 85% of patients. The use of an Ag-RDT is robustly supported in community settings, where it would avert more transmission at lower cost than relying on NAT alone, under a wide range of assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Despite their imperfect sensitivity and specificity, Ag-RDTs have the potential to be simultaneously more impactful, and have a lower cost per death and infectious person-days averted, than current approaches to COVID-19 diagnostic testing.

Thanks to our automated molecular diagnostic platform, more than 140 000 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were achieved over 12 months, with peaks higher than 1 500 daily tests. A dashboard was developed to give access to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to improve laboratory operational management. Methods: RT-PCR data extraction of four respiratory viruses - SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B and RSV - from our laboratory information system (LIS), was automated. Important KPIs were identified and the visualization was achieved using an in-house dashboard based on the open-source language R (Shiny). Information is updated every 4 hours. Results: The dashboard is organized into three main parts. The Filter page presents all the KPIs, divided into five sections: i) general and gender-related indicators, ii) number of tests and positivity rate, iii) cycle threshold and viral load, iv) test durations, and v) not valid results. Filtering allows to select a given period, a dedicated instrument, a given specimen, or a requester for instance. The Comparison page allows a custom charting of all the available variables, which represents more than 182 combinations.

However, most conventional hydrogels cannot be injected after gelation and do not support the infiltration of cells because of the static nature of their network structure. Here, we develop unique cell-infiltratable and injectable (Ci-I) gelatin hydrogels, which are physically cross-linked by weak and highly dynamic host–guest complexations and are further reinforced by limited chemical cross-linking for enhanced stability, and then demonstrate the outstanding properties of these Ci-I gelatin hydrogels. The highly dynamic network of Ci-I hydrogels allows injection of prefabricated hydrogels with encapsulated cells and drugs, thereby simplifying administration during surgery. Furthermore, the reversible nature of the weak host–guest cross-links enables infiltration and migration of external cells into Ci-I gelatin hydrogels, thereby promoting the participation of endogenous cells in the healing process. Our findings show that Ci-I hydrogels can mediate sustained delivery of small hydrophobic molecular drugs (e.g., icaritin) to boost differentiation of stem cells while avoiding the adverse effects (e.g., in treatment of bone necrosis) associated with high drug dosage. The injection of Ci-I hydrogels encapsulating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and drug (icaritin) efficiently prevented the decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) and promoted in situ bone regeneration in an animal model of steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) of the hip by creating the microenvironment favoring the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, including the recruited endogenous cells. We believe that this is the first demonstration on applying injectable hydrogels as effective carriers of therapeutic cargo for treating dysfunctions in deep and enclosed anatomical sites via a minimally invasive procedure.","Feng, Qian; Xu, Jiankun; Zhang, Kunyu; Yao, Hao; Zheng, Nianye; Zheng, Lizhen; Wang, Jiali; Wei, Kongchang; Xiao, Xiufeng; Qin, Ling; Bian, Liming",ACS Cent Sci,365,3

This data is updated every day and is available for most countries from multiple sources. In this work we present a two step procedure for model fitting to Covid-19 data. In the first step, time dependent transmission coefficients are constructed directly from the data and, in the second step, measures of those (minimum, maximum, mean, median etc.,) are used to set priors for fitting models to data. We call this approach a ""data driven approach"" or ""data first approach"". This scheme is complementary to Bayesian approach and can be used with or without that for parameter estimation. We use the procedure to fit a set of SIR and SIRD models, with time dependent contact rate, to Covid-19 data for a set of 45 most affected countries. We find that SIR and SIRD models with constant transmission coefficients cannot fit Covid-19 data for most countries (mainly because social distancing, lockdown etc., make those time dependent). We find that any time dependent contact rate, which falls gradually with time, can help to fit SIR and SIRD models for most of the countries. We also present constraints on transmission coefficients and basic reproduction number R0~ as well as effective reproduction number R(t). The main contributions of our work are as follows.

Herein, we exploited a live attenuated SG mutant, JOL967, to deliver spike (S) protein 1 of IB virus (V) to elicit protective immunity against both FT and IB in chickens. The codon optimized S1 nucleotide sequence was cloned in-frame into a prokaryotic constitutive expression vector, pJHL65. Subsequently, empty pJHL65 or recombinant pJHL65-S1 plasmid was electroporated into JOL967 and the resultant clones were designated as JOL2068 and JOL2077, respectively. Our results demonstrated that the chickens vaccinated once orally with JOL2077 elicited significantly (p < 0.05) higher IBV-specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity compared to JOL2068 and PBS control groups. Consequently, on challenge with the virulent IBV strain at 28(th) day post-vaccination, JOL2077 vaccinated birds displayed significantly (p < 0.05) lower inflammatory lesions in virus-targeted tissues compared to control groups. Furthermore, 33.3% (2 of 6) of birds vaccinated with JOL2077 vaccine had shown virus recovery from tracheal tissues compared to 100% (6 of 6) recovery obtained in both the control groups. Against wild-type SG lethal challenge, both JOL2077 and JOL2068 vaccinated groups exhibited only 10% mortality compared to 80% mortality observed in PBS control group. In conclusion, we show that JOL2077 can induce efficient IBV- and carrier-specific protective immunity and can act as a bivalent vaccine against FT and IB.

Although Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) is considered to be the gold standard, serological tests based on antibodies could be very helpful. However, individual studies are usually inconclusive, thus, a comparison of different tests is needed. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv. We used the bivariate method for meta-analysis of diagnostic tests pooling sensitivities and specificities. We evaluated IgM and IgG tests based on Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassays (CLIA), Fluorescence Immunoassays (FIA), and the Lateral Flow Immunoassays (LFIA). We identified 38 studies containing data from 7848 individuals. Tests using the S antigen are more sensitive than N antigen-based tests. IgG tests perform better compared to IgM ones and show better sensitivity when the samples were taken longer after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, a combined IgG/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody alone. All methods yield high specificity with some of them (ELISA and LFIA) reaching levels around 99%. ELISA- and CLIA-based methods perform better in terms of sensitivity (90%–94%) followed by LFIA and FIA with sensitivities ranging from 80% to 89%. ELISA tests could be a safer choice at this stage of the pandemic. LFIA tests are more attractive for large seroprevalence studies but show lower sensitivity, and this should be taken into account when designing and performing seroprevalence studies.","Kontou, Panagiota I.; Braliou, Georgia G.; Dimou, Niki L.; Nikolopoulos, Georgios; Bagos, Pantelis G.",Diagnostics (Basel),365,16

Reliable and cost-effective diagnostic tests, along with effective vaccines and vector-control strategies, are highly required to reduce dengue morbidity and mortality. Evaluation studies revealed that many commercially available NS1 antigen (Ag) tests have limited sensitivity to DENV-4 serotype compared to the other three serotypes. These studies indicated the need for development of new NS1 Ag detection test with improved sensitivity to DENV-4. An NS1 capture enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) specific to DENV-4 may improve the detection of DENV-4 cases worldwide. In addition, a serotype-specific NS1 Ag test identifies both DENV and the infecting serotype. METHODS: In this study, we used a small-ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO*) cloning vector to express a SUMO*-DENV-4 rNS1 fusion protein to develop NS1 DENV-4 specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). These newly developed MAbs were then optimized for use in an anti-NS1 DENV-4 capture ELISA. The serotype specificity and sensitivity of this ELISA was evaluated using (i) supernatants from DENV (1–4)-infected Vero cell cultures, (ii) rNS1s from all the four DENV (1–4) and, (iii) rNS1s of related flaviviruses (yellow fever virus; YFV and West Nile virus; WNV). RESULTS: From the evaluation studies of the newly developed MAbs, we identified three DENV-4 specific anti-NS1 MAbs: 3H7A9, 8A6F2 and 6D4B10. Two of these MAbs were optimal for use in a DENV-4 serotype-specific NS1 capture ELISA: MAb 8A6F2 as the capture antibody and 6D4B10 as a detection antibody. CONCLUSION: This ELISA was sensitive and specific to DENV-4 with no cross-reactivity to other three DENV (1–3) serotypes and other heterologous flaviviruses. Taken together these data indicated that our MAbs are useful reagents for the development of DENV-4 immunodiagnostic tests.

A 30-year-old man with no known past medical history presented with gross hematuria and subnephrotic proteinuria 24 hours after the second dose of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. A kidney biopsy showed IgAN. He was started on an angiotensin receptor blocker resulting in proteinuria reduction. Similar to natural infection of SARS-CoV2, persons who receive two mRNA-based vaccines demonstrate robust antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 protein. Given the uniqueness of glycosylation of RBD and potent stimulation of immune response from mRNA-based vaccine compared to other vaccines, we hypothesize that our patient developed de novo antibodies leading to IgA-containing immune-complex deposits. This case highlights the urgency of understanding the immunological responses to novel mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in more diverse populations. Despite the lack of clear causality, nephrologists should be alerted if any new-onset hematuria or proteinuria is observed.","Abramson, Matthew; Mon-Wei Yu, Samuel; Campbell, Kirk N.; Chung, Miriam; Salem, Fadi",Kidney Med,365,33

Chest tomography shows cystic image with heterogeneous content in the left lower lobe. We decided to opt for surgery, previously 1 PCR in RT and 7 serological tests for COVID- 19 were performed, the result of which was non-reactive. In the postoperative period, the patient developed fever and dyspnea on mild exertion, so a new serological test for COVID-19 was performed: IgM / IgG reactive, in addition chest tomography showed both lungs with ""cracy paving"" pattern. DISCUSSION: The serological tests did not contribute to a timely diagnosis of COVID-19 and generated confusion. We used oxygen therapy, broad spectrum antibiotics since the diagnosis of COVID-19. Likewise, respiratory physiotherapy was intensified even after discharge. CONCLUSION: The early diagnosis and use of antibiotics at doses of sepsis, associated with corticosteroid pulses and respiratory physiotherapy improve COVID-19 pneumonia in postoperative lung surgery.","Taipe, Ricardo; Euscatigue, Mardonio; Valdivia, Fernando; Belloso, Brener; Huaroto, Irene",Int J Surg Case Rep,365,21

We estimate PHC expenditure for each low-income and middle-income country between 2000 and 2017 and test which health outputs and outcomes were associated with PHC expenditure. METHODS: We used three data sources to estimate PHC expenditures: recently published health expenditure estimates for each low-income and middle-income country, which were constructed using 1662 country-reported National Health Accounts; proprietary data from IQVIA to estimate expenditure of prescribed pharmaceuticals for PHC; and household surveys and costing estimates to estimate inpatient vaginal delivery expenditures. We employed regression analyses to measure the association between PHC expenditures and 15 health outcomes and intermediate health outputs. RESULTS: PHC expenditures in low-income and middle-income countries increased between 2000 and 2017, from $41 per capita (95% uncertainty interval $33–$49) to $90 ($73–$105). Expenditures for low-income countries plateaued since 2014 at $17 per capita ($15–$19). As national income increased, the proportion of health expenditures on PHC generally decrease; however, the fraction of PHC expenditures spent via ambulatory care providers grew. Increases in the fraction of health expenditures on PHC was associated with lower maternal mortality rate (p value≤0.001), improved coverage of antenatal care visits (p value≤0.001), measles vaccination (p value≤0.001) and an increase in the Health Access and Quality index (p value≤0.05). PHC expenditure was not systematically associated with all-age mortality, communicable and non-communicable disease (NCD) burden. CONCLUSION: PHC expenditures were associated with maternal and child health but were not associated with reduction in health burden for other key causes of disability, such as NCDs. To combat changing disease burdens, policy-makers and health professionals need to adapt primary healthcare to ensure continued impact on emerging health challenges.","Schneider, Matthew T; Chang, Angela Y; Crosby, Sawyer W; Gloyd, Stephen; Harle, Anton C; Lim, Stephen; Lozano, Rafael; Micah, Angela E; Tsakalos, Golsum; Su, Yanfang; Murray, Christopher J L; Dieleman, Joseph L",BMJ Glob Health,365,1

ACE2 plays a key role in the biosynthesis of angiotensin (1-7), catalyzing the conversion of angiotensin 2 into angiotensin (1-7) and the reaction of angiotensin synthesis (1-9), from which angiotensin is (1-7) produced under the influence of ACE (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme). Angiotensin 2 is a potent vasoconstrictor and atherogenic molecule converted by ACE2 to reducing inflammation and vasodilating in action angiotensin (1-7). Angiotensin (1-9), that is a product of angiotensin 1 metabolism and precursor of angiotensin (1-7), also exerts cell protective properties. Balance between angiotensin 2 and angiotensin (1-7) regulates blood pressure and ACE2 plays a critical role in this balance. ACE2, unlike ACE, is not inhibited by ACE inhibitors at the doses used in humans during the treatment of arterial hypertension. Membrane ACE2 is one of the receptors that allows SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells. ACE2 after SARS-CoV-2 binding is internalized and degraded. Hence ACE2 activity on the cell surface is reduced leading to increase the concentration of angiotensin 2 and decrease the concentration of angiotensin (1-7). Disturbed angiotensins metabolism, changes in ratio between angiotensins with distinct biological activities leading to domination of atherogenic angiotensin 2 can increase the damage to the lungs.","Dettlaff-Pokora, Agnieszka; Swierczynski, Julian",Int J Mol Sci,365,16

A 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that no significant differences were observed in diversity and richness indices (observed species, Shannon, Simpson, Chao1, abundance-based coverage estimators, and phylogeny-based metrics) of soil bacterial communities among the three cropping systems. However, relative abundances of dominant phyla in soil bacterial communities, including Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Nitrospirae, Gemmatimonadetes, and Verrucomicrobia, were significantly different among the three cropping systems. In particular, a significant reduction in the relative abundance of Nitrospirae was observed in both MRR and ORR compared with FRR. These results indicate that bacterial community structure was affected by cropping systems in the tested paddy soils. Based on the results of our studies and existing knowledge bases, we speculate that benefits to rice yield may be obtained by reducing the relative abundance of Nitrospirae and increasing the ratio of abundances of Proteobacteria/Acidobacteria in paddy soils.","Huang, Min; Tian, Alin; Chen, Jiana; Cao, Fangbo; Chen, Yumei; Liu, Longsheng",Sci Rep,365,24

A linear regression model trained on historical data was used to estimate anticipated transplantation volume. RESULTS. All UNOS regions reported a decrease in total waitlist additions and transplant surgeries. The largest decreases in total transplants were identified in regions 1, 2, 6, and 9, with regions 2, 7, 8, and 9 noting the largest decrease in waitlist additions. Six of the 11 regions noted increases in waitlist deaths, with UNOS regions 9, 1, and 2, all located within the Northeast, noting the highest percent increase in waitlist deaths at 170%, 89%, and 54%, respectively.

This study sought to characterize the risk factors for and outcomes following COVID-19 infection in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Maintenance dialysis patients in clinics with at least one patient with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 from February to June 2020, treated by a mid-size national dialysis provider. PREDICTORS: Demographics, dialysis characteristics, residence in a congregate setting, comorbid conditions, measures of frailty, and use of selected medications. OUTCOMES: COVID-19 defined as having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and all-cause mortality among those with COVID-19. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Logistic regression analyses to identify clinical characteristics associated with COVID-19and risk factors associated with mortality among patients following COVID-19. RESULTS: 438/7948 (5.5%) maintenance dialysis patients developed COVID-19. Male sex, Black race, in-center dialysis (vs. home dialysis), treatment at an urban clinic, residence in a congregate setting, and greater comorbidity were associated with contracting COVID-19. Odds of COVID-19 was 17-fold higher for those residing in a congregate setting [OR = 17.10 (95% CI 13.51, 21.54)]. Of the 438 maintenance dialysis patients with COVID-19, 109 (24.9%) died. Older age, heart disease, and markers of frailty were associated with mortality. LIMITATIONS: No distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positivity, with asymptomatic screening limited by testing capacity during this initial COVID-19 surge period. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is common among patients receiving maintenance dialysis, particularly those residing in congregate settings. Among maintenance dialysis patients with COVID-19, mortality is high, exceeding 20%.","Hsu, Caroline M.; Weiner, Daniel E.; Aweh, Gideon; Miskulin, Dana C.; Manley, Harold J.; Stewart, Carol; Ladik, Vlad; Hosford, John; Lacson, Edward C.; Johnson, Douglas S.; Lacson, Eduardo",Am J Kidney Dis,365,24

BACKGROUND: Headache is one of the most frequent neurologic symptoms of Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid‐19). Diagnosis of secondary headache disorders is still based on the presence of red flags. DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross‐sectional study of hospitalized patients with confirmed Covid‐19 disease. We interrogated every patient about the presence of headache and if so, a headache expert conducted a structured interview assessing the presence and type of the main red flags. We evaluated the presence of laboratory abnormalities on admission. RESULTS: We screened 576 consecutive patients, 130/576 (22.6%) described headache, and 104 were included in the study. Mean age of patients was 56.7 (standard deviation: 11.2) and 66/104 (63.4%) were female. Red flags concerning prior medical history were present in 79/104 (76.0%) cases, and those related to the headache itself were observed in 99/104 (95.2%) patients. All patients 104/104 (100%) described systemic symptoms and 86/104 (82.7%) some neurologic symptoms. Laboratory results were abnormal in 98/104 (94.2%) cases. The most frequent red flags were fever, in 93/104 (89.4%) patients, cough, in 89/104 (85.6% cases), and increased C‐reactive protein in 84/100 (84.0%) cases. CONCLUSION: In patients with Covid‐19 that described the headache red flags were present in most cases.

A global call to accelerate efforts to eliminate this disease has generated a new global strategy proposing ambitious, but achievable, targets for HPV vaccination of girls, and screening and treatment of women. The present paper addresses the suboptimal access to HPV vaccination in low‐income and lower‐middle‐income countries (LICs/LMICs), where the burden of disease weighs most heavily, in part through co‐infection with HIV. A proposed framework for action was formulated by first reviewing the reasons underlying gaps in HPV vaccine coverage. Good practices from recent introductions of HPV vaccine at scale in LICs/LMICs were then assessed based on targeted literature reviews and the experience and views of the authors. Difficulties in uptake and coverage of the HPV vaccine relate to the costs of the vaccine and service delivery, lack of prioritization, the challenges of vaccinating adolescents, and shortage of vaccines as the supply failed to keep pace with the rapid expansion in global demand, including from LICs/LMICs. The framework for action calls for new strategic thinking to consolidate global learning and invigorate operationalization at a country level.","Kumar, Somesh; Khanduri, Arunima; Sidibe, Anissa; Morgan, Christopher; Torode, Julie; Basu, Partha; Bhatla, Neerja; Schocken, Celina; Bloem, Paul",Int J Gynaecol Obstet,365,5

We estimated the potential impact of adding linked, opt-out HIV testing alongside SARS-CoV-2 testing on HIV incidence and the cost-effectiveness of this strategy in six US cities. METHODS: Using a previously-calibrated dynamic HIV transmission model, we constructed three sets of scenarios for each city: (1) sustained current levels of HIV-related treatment and prevention services (status quo); (2) temporary disruptions in health services and changes in sexual and injection risk behaviours at discrete levels between 0%-50%; and (3) linked HIV and SARS-CoV-2 testing offered to 10%-90% of the adult population in addition to scenario (2). We estimated cumulative HIV infections between 2020-2025 and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of linked HIV testing over 20 years. RESULTS: In the absence of linked, opt-out HIV testing, we estimated a total of 16.5% decrease in HIV infections between 2020-2025 in the best-case scenario (50% reduction in risk behaviours and no service disruptions), and 9.0% increase in the worst-case scenario (no behavioural change and 50% reduction in service access). We estimated that HIV testing (offered at 10%-90% levels) could avert a total of 576-7,225 (1.6%-17.2%) new infections. The intervention would require an initial investment of $20.6M-$220.7M across cities; however, the intervention would ultimately result in savings in health care costs in each city. CONCLUSIONS: A campaign in which HIV testing is linked with SARS-CoV-2 testing could substantially reduce HIV incidence and reduce direct and indirect health care costs attributable to HIV.","Zang, Xiao; Krebs, Emanuel; Chen, Siyuan; Piske, Micah; Armstrong, Wendy S; Behrends, Czarina N; Del Rio, Carlos; Feaster, Daniel J; Marshall, Brandon D L; Mehta, Shruti H; Mermin, Jonathan; Metsch, Lisa R; Schackman, Bruce R; Strathdee, Steffanie A; Nosyk, Bohdan",Clin Infect Dis,365,1

OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis to examine the prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias detected by the electrocardiogram and their relationships with adverse outcomes in patients with COVID‐19. METHODS: PubMed and Google were searched for studies that reported on cardiac arrhythmias and/or examined the relationship between arrhythmias and adverse outcomes. RESULTS: Thirty studies with 12,713 participants were included in the systematic review, and 28 studies (n = 12,499) in the meta‐analysis. The mean age was 61.3 ± 16.8 years; 39.3% were female. In 25 studies with 7578 patients, the overall prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias was 10.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.4%–12.3%). The most common arrhythmias documented during hospitalization were supraventricular arrhythmias (6.2%, 95% CI: 4.4%–8.1%) followed by ventricular arrhythmias (2.5%, 95% CI: 1.8%–3.1%). The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias was higher among critically ill patients (relative risk [RR]: 12.1, 95% CI: 8.5–17.3) and among non‐survivors (RR: 3.8, 95%, CI: 1.7–8.7). Eight studies reported changes in the QT interval. The prevalence of QTc > 500 ms was 12.3% (95% CI: 6.9%–17.8%). ST‐segment deviation was reported in eight studies, with a pooled estimate of 8.7% (95% CI: 7.3% to 10.0%).

Their mood response profile was described and compared with pre-COVID-19 norms. The mood profile represented an inverse iceberg profile, with mean scores deviating significantly from pre-COVID-19 norms across all six mood dimensions measured. The inverse iceberg profile had been associated with a range of psychopathologies, suggesting an increased risk of psychological disorders. The current profile of mood responses could alert clinicians to the possibility of increased mental health needs of patients.

Using an epidemiologic model, we simulated exportation of cases from severe acute respiratory syndrome–like and influenza-like epidemics in a population for which a small proportion travel more frequently than the rest. Our simulations show that frequent travelers accelerate international spread of epidemics only if they are infected early in an outbreak and the outbreak does not expand rapidly. If the epidemic growth rate is high, as is likely for pandemic influenza, heterogeneities in travel are frequently overwhelmed by the large number of infected persons in the majority population and the resulting high probability that some of these persons will take an international flight.","Hollingsworth, T.

This aim has driven widespread and rapid application of untested policies to control contagion, including the deployment of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including travel restrictions, bans on gathering, and community-wide lockdowns. Risk models, public health experts and political leadership alike have given almost no attention to related, anticipated, and predictable societal and health impacts likely to result from behavioral responses to Covid-19 combined with the application of NPIs. Methods: This analysis demonstrates a standard risk assessment approach to quantify the impacts of Covid-19 unemployment in the United States on suicide and all cause mortality. Results: Applying observational epidemiological data to the population recently unemployed predicts 7444 deaths from suicide in the coming year and 556,000 avoidable deaths from all causes over the next ten years. Discussion: Indirect health impacts of societal responses to Covid-19 are likely and quantifiable. Decision-makers can now include indirect health impacts into their policy making calculus for Covid-19 to strike a balance between the benefits and costs of mitigation.

This formative study addressed existing and potential social mobilisation mechanisms seeking behaviour to tackle NCDs in El Salvador, with an emphasis on the implications in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted 19 semi-structured interviews with health workers, government officials, NGO leaders, and community members. Interviews addressed mechanisms for social mobilisation which existed prior to COVID-19, the ways in which these mechanisms tackled NCDs, the impact of COVID-19 on social mobilisation activities and new, emerging mechanisms for social mobilisation in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Findings indicate a growing awareness of NCDs within communities, with social mobilisation activities seen as valuable in tackling NCDs. However, major barriers to NCD prevention and treatment provision remain, with COVID-19 constraining many possible social mobilisation activities, leaving NCD patients with less support. Factors linked with effective social mobilisation of communities for NCD prevention included strong engagement of community health teams within community structures and the delivery of NCD prevention and management messages through community meetings with trusted health professionals or community members. There are gender differences in the experience of NCDs and women were generally more engaged with social mobilisation activities than men. In the context of COVID-19, traditional forms of social mobilisation were challenged, and new, virtual forms emerged. However, these new forms of engagement did not benefit all, especially those in hard-to-reach rural areas. In these contexts, specific traditional forms of mobilisation such as through radio (where possible) and trusted community leaders - became increasingly important. CONCLUSIONS: New mechanisms of fostering social mobilisation include virtual connectors such as mobile phones, which enable mobilisation through platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter. However, traditional forms of social mobilisation hold value for those without access to such technology. Therefore, a combination of new and traditional mechanisms for social mobilisation hold potential for the future development of social mobilisation strategies in El Salvador and, as appropriate, in other fragile health contexts.","Caperon, Lizzie; Arakelyan, Stella; Innocenti, Cinzia; Ager, Alastair",Int J Equity Health,365,1

The objective of this study was to analyze the characteristics and outcomes of male compared to female adults with COVID-19 who required hospitalization within US academic centers. METHODS: Using the Vizient clinical database, discharge records of adults with a diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and November 30, 2020 were reviewed. Outcome measures included demographics, characteristics, length of hospital stay, rate of respiratory intubation and mechanical ventilation, and rate of in-hospital mortality of male vs female according to age, race/ethnicity, and presence of preexisting comorbidities. RESULTS: Among adults with COVID-19, 161,206 were male while 146,804 were female. Adult males with COVID-19 were more likely to have hypertension (62.1% vs 59.6%, p <0.001%), diabetes (39.2% vs 36.0%, p <0.001%), renal failure (22.3% vs 18.1%, p <0.001%), congestive heart failure (15.3% vs 14.6%, p <0.001%), and liver disease (5.9% vs 4.5%, p <0.001%). Adult females with COVID-19 were more likely to be obese (32.3% vs 25.7%, p<0.001) and have chronic pulmonary disease (23.7% vs 18.1%, p <0.001). Gender was significantly different among races (p<0.001), and there was a lower proportion of males versus females in African American patients with COVID-19. Comparison in outcomes of male vs. female adults with COVID-19 is depicted in Table 2. Compared to females, males with COVID-19 had a higher rate of in-hospital mortality (13.8% vs 10.2%, respectively, p <0.001); a higher rate of respiratory intubation (21.4% vs 14.6%, p <0.001); and a longer length of hospital stay (9.5 ± 12.5 days vs. 7.8 ± 9.8 days, p<0.001). In-hospital mortality analyzed according to age groups, race/ethnicity, payers, and presence of preexisting comorbidities consistently showed higher death rate among males compared to females (Table 2). Adult males with COVID-19 were associated with higher odds of mortality compared to their female counterparts across all age groups, with the effect being most pronounced in the 18–30 age group (OR, 3.02 [95% CI, 2.41–3.78]). CONCLUSION: This large analysis of 308,010 COVID-19 adults hospitalized at US academic centers showed that males have a higher rate of respiratory intubation and longer length of hospital stay compared to females and have a higher death rate even when compared across age groups, race/ethnicity, payers, and comorbidity.","Nguyen, Ninh T.; Chinn, Justine; De Ferrante, Morgan; Kirby, Katharine A.; Hohmann, Samuel F.; Amin, Alpesh",PLoS One,365,18

METHODS: Lungs of 12 consecutive COVID-19 decedents consented for autopsy were evaluated for gross and histopathologic abnormalities. A complete Ghon “en block” dissection was performed on all cases; lung weights and gross characteristics recorded. Immunohistochemical studies were performed to characterize lymphocytic infiltrates and to assess SARS-CoV-2 capsid protein. RESULTS: Two distinct patterns of pulmonary involvement were identified. Three of 12 cases demonstrated a predominance of acute alveolar damage (DAD) while 9 of 12 cases demonstrated a marked increase in intra-alveolar macrophages in a fashion resembling desquamative interstitial pneumonia or macrophage activation syndrome (DIP/MAS). Two patterns were correlated solely with a statistically significant difference in the duration of illness. The group exhibiting DAD had duration of illness of 5.7 days while the group with DIP/MAS had duration of illness of 21.5 days (t-test p = 0.014).

The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences of older adults during the first UK lockdown (March–June 2020), specifically how our sample reacted to public health messaging, staying food secure and drawing on available social capital within their community. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with eight participants. In addition, twenty-five participants completed a qualitative ‘open-ended’ survey. The data was collated and analysed, adopting a Thematic Analysis informed approach. Three themes were identified: (1) Too Much Information, (2) The Importance of Neighbours and Connections and (3) Not Wishing to be a Burden. These findings offer a rich insight into how early lockdown measures, never witnessed since World War 2, exposed existing pre-pandemic inequalities and concerns relating to loneliness, isolation and wellbeing.

METHODS: A total of 1172 online questionnaires were collected, covering demographical information and 8 common psychological states: depression, anxiety, somatization, stress, psychological resilience, suicidal ideation and behavior, insomnia, and stress disorder. In addition, the geographical and temporal distributions of different mental states were plotted. RESULTS: Overall, 30.1% of smokers increased smoking, while 11.3% of drinkers increased alcohol consumption. The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, mental health problems, high risk of suicidal and behavior, clinical insomnia, clinical post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, moderate-to-high levels of perceived stress were 18.8%, 13.3%, 7.6%, 2.8%, 7.2%, 7.0%, and 67.9%, respectively. Further, the geographical distribution showed that the mental status in some provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities was relatively more serious. The temporal distribution showed that the psychological state of the participants was relatively poorer on February 20, 24 to 26 and March 25, especially on March 25. LIMITATIONS: This cross-sectional design cannot make causal inferences. And the snowball sampling was not representative enough. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the prevalence rate of mental disorders in the Chinese public is relatively low in the second month of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, people's mental state is affected by the geographical and temporal distributions.","Ren, Yali; Qian, Wei; Zhang, Xiangyang; Liu, Zhengkui; Zhou, Yongjie; Wang, Ruoxi; Qi, Ling; Yang, Jiezhi; Song, Xiuli; Zeng, Lingyun; Li, Zezhi",J Affect Disord,365,8

The ease of its propagation, coupled with its high capacity for illness and death in infected individuals, makes it a hazard to the community. Chest X-rays are one of the most common but most difficult to interpret radiographic examination for early diagnosis of coronavirus-related infections. They carry a considerable amount of anatomical and physiological information, but it is sometimes difficult even for the expert radiologist to derive the related information they contain. Automatic classification using deep learning models can help in better assessing these infections swiftly. Deep CNN models, namely, MobileNet, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, were applied with different variations, including training the model from the start, fine-tuning along with adjusting learned weights of all layers, and fine-tuning with learned weights along with augmentation. Fine-tuning with augmentation produced the best results in pretrained models. Out of these, two best-performing models (MobileNet and InceptionV3) selected for ensemble learning produced accuracy and FScore of 95.18% and 90.34%, and 95.75% and 91.47%, respectively. The proposed hybrid ensemble model generated with the merger of these deep models produced a classification accuracy and FScore of 96.49% and 92.97%. For test dataset, which was separately kept, the model generated accuracy and FScore of 94.19% and 88.64%. Automatic classification using deep ensemble learning can help radiologists in the correct identification of coronavirus-related infections in chest X-rays. Consequently, this swift and computer-aided diagnosis can help in saving precious human lives and minimizing the social and economic impact on society.","Ahmad, Fareed; Farooq, Amjad; Ghani, Muhammad Usman",Comput Intell Neurosci,365,29

MATERIAL AND METHOD Use of the formalized consensus method. RESULTS The medical and surgical management of patients in andrology and sexual medicine must be adapted. Consultations should, as far as possible, be carried out by tele-consultation. For operative procedures, the delay between the operative decision and the date of (re)scheduling of the procedure will depend on: (1) the level of criticality of the clinical situation; (2) the type of intervention; (3) the functional and psychological repercussions, including quality of life while waiting for the procedure; (4) the notion of losing the chance of having an optimal outcome; (5) the risk of potential complications from delaying a procedure for too long; and (6) taking into account the patient's risk factors for severe forms of COVID-19. The protection of urologists from COVID-19 should be considered. Each urologist must make the best decision for the patient, taking into account the acceptable time frame and quality of life impact before surgical management, the COVID risk parameters, the technical and anesthetic feasibility and the structural possibility of the health care institution to ensure a specific dedicated pathway during the COVID-19 health crisis. CONCLUSION The management of andrological and sexual medicine pathologies must be adapted to the COVID-19 crisis context. Some patients may require surgery, including in emergency. These recommendations are transitional and will end with the COVID-19 crisis.","Huyghe, Eric; Graziana, Jean Pierre; Methorst, Charlotte; Journel, Nicolas Morel; Terrier, Jean Etienne; Marcelli, François; Madec, François Xavier; Yiou, René; Akakpo, William; Hupertan, Vincent; Carnicelli, Damien; Beley, Sébastien; Ferretti, Ludovic; Faix, Antoine",Prog Urol,365,16

To overcome these challenges, the Center of Acute Care of the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands, has established a de novo data, image and biobank named 'Acutelines'. PARTICIPANTS Clinical data, imaging data and biomaterials (ie, blood, urine, faeces, hair) are collected from patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a broad range of acute disease presentations. A deferred consent procedure (by proxy) is in place to allow collecting data and biomaterials prior to obtaining written consent. The digital infrastructure used ensures automated capturing of all bed-side monitoring data (ie, vital parameters, electrophysiological waveforms) and securely importing data from other sources, such as the electronic health records of the hospital, ambulance and general practitioner, municipal registration and pharmacy. Data are collected from all included participants during the first 72 hours of their hospitalisation, while follow-up data are collected at 3 months, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years after their ED visit. FINDINGS TO DATE Enrolment of the first participant occurred on 1 September 2020. During the first month, 653 participants were screened for eligibility, of which 180 were approached as potential participants. In total, 151 (84%) provided consent for participation of which 89 participants fulfilled criteria for collection of biomaterials. FUTURE PLANS The main aim of Acutelines is to facilitate research in acute medicine by providing the framework for novel studies and issuing data, images and biomaterials for future research. The protocol will be extended by connecting with central registries to obtain long-term follow-up data, for which we already request permission from the participant.

AIM: To explore the spreading of COVID-19 in relation to population density after the introduction of social distancing measures. DESIGN & SETTING: Longitudinal design with 5-weekly COVID-19 incidence rates per 100 000 people for 149 English Upper Tier Local Authorities (UTLAs), between 16 March and 19 April 2020. METHOD: Multivariable multilevel model to analyse weekly incidence rates per 100 000 people; time was level-1 unit and UTLA level-2 unit. Population density was divided into quartiles. The model included an interaction between week and population density. Potential confounders were percentage aged ≥65, percentage non-white British, and percentage in two highest classes of the National Statistics Socioeconomic Classification. Co-variates were male life expectancy at birth, and COVID-19 prevalence rate per 100 000 people on March 15. Confounders and co-variates were standardised around the mean. RESULTS: Incidence rates per 100 000 people peaked in the week of March 30–April 5, showing higher adjusted incidence rate per 100 000 people (46.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 40.6 to 51.8) in most densely populated ULTAs (quartile 4) than in less densely populated ULTAs (quartile 1: 33.3, 95% CI = 27.4 to 37.2; quartile 2: 35.9, 95% CI = 31.6 to 40.1). Thereafter, incidence rate dropped in the most densely populated ULTAs resulting in rate of 22.4 (95% CI = 16.9 to 28.0) in the week of April 13–19; this was lower than in quartiles 1, 2, and 3, respectively 31.4 (95% CI = 26.5 to 36.3), 34.2 (95% CI = 29.9 to 38.5), and 43.2 (95% CI = 39.0 to 47.4).

The same multiplicity, diversity, and heterogenicity that represent the culture, languages, and socio-economic status of the people of Latin America also characterize the vast mixture of networked learning initiatives across the region. Potential barriers (i.e., the digital divide, Internet filtering policies, lack of research) and opportunities for implementation (i.e., networked learning educational reforms, mobile learning technology, and social media ethical considerations) are explored. The paper concludes with recommendations that policymakers and education leaders in Latin America should keep in mind to engage in fruitful networked learning initiatives.","Romero-Hall, Enilda",Educ Technol Res Dev,365,16

Risk factors for a severe disease course for young COVID-19 patients and possibly non-linear influences remain unknown. Methods Data of COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, collected retrospectively from Jan 24th to Mar 27th, were analyzed. Clinical, demographic, treatment and laboratory data were collected from patients' medical records. Uni- and multivariable analysis using logistic regression and random forest, with the latter allowing the study of non-linear influences, were performed to investigate and exploit the clinical characteristics of a severe disease course. Results A total of 762 young patients (median age 47 years, interquartile ranges [IQR] 38 - 55, range 16 - 60; 55.9% female) were included, as well as 714 elderly patients as a comparison group. Among the young patients, 362 (47.5%) had a severe/critical disease course and the mean age was significantly higher in the severe subgroup than in the mild subgroup (59.3 vs. 56.0, Student's t-test: p < 0.001). The uni- and multivariable analysis suggested that several covariates such as elevated levels of ASS, CRP and LDH, and decreased lymphocyte counts are influential on disease severity independent of age. Elevated levels of complement C3 (odds ratio [OR] 15.6, 95% CI 2.41-122.3; p=0.039) are particularly associated with the risk for the development of severity specifically in young patients, where no such influence seems to exist for elderly patients. Additional analysis suggests that the influence of complement C3 in young patients is independent of age, gender, and comorbidities. Variable importance values and partial dependence plots obtained using random forests delivered additional insights, in particular indicating non-linear influences of risk factors on disease severity. Conclusion In young patients with COVID-19, the levels of complement C3 correlated with disease severity and tended to be a good predictor of adverse outcome.","Cheng, W.; Hornung, R.; Xu, K.; Li, J.",,365,17

Unfortunately, no FDA-approved anti-HAdV drug is currently available for treatment. Within the nucleus of infected cells, the HAdV genome associates with histones and forms a chromatin-like structure during early infection, and viral gene expression appears regulated by cellular epigenetic processes. Thus, one potential therapeutic strategy to combat HAdV disease may be to target the cellular proteins involved in modifying the viral nucleoprotein structure and facilitating HAdV gene expression and replication. We have screened a panel of small molecules that modulate the activity of epigenetic regulatory proteins for compounds affecting HAdV gene expression. Several of the compounds, specifically chaetocin, gemcitabine and lestaurtinib, reduced HAdV recovery by 100- to 1000-fold, while showing limited effect on cell health, suggesting that these compounds may indeed be promising as anti-HAdV therapeutics.","Saha, Bratati; Parks, Robin J.",Virology,365,18

Pour ces infections, seules les épidémies nosocomiales sont rapportées et signalées. Nous avons souhaité mettre en oeuvre une surveillance rétrospective des infections respiratoires virales nosocomiales (IRVN) dans notre établissement afin d’en mesurer l’incidence. Matériels et méthodes L’étude descriptive monocentrique s’est déroulée sur le 1er trimestre des années 2016, 2017, 2018 et 2019 à partir des résultats virologiques positifs disponibles dans le logiciel du laboratoire de notre établissement (1700 lits). La surveillance a porté sur les virus suivants : influenzae A et B, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, virus respiratoire syncytial (VRS), metapneumovirus, adenovirus et coronavirus. Pour chaque virus, une durée maximale d’incubation a été déterminée à partir de données de la littérature. Une origine nosocomiale a été retenue lorsque le prélèvement positif a été réalisé plus de x jours (x=durée maximale d’incubation) après l’admission du patient. La gravité des cas nosocomiaux a été évaluée sur les critères d’une admission en Réanimation ou d’un décès dans les 30jours suivant le diagnostic puis par l’analyse des courriers médicaux. Ont été mesuré pour chaque virus : la fréquence de l’infection/100 patients admis, la densité d’incidence des IRVN/1000 journées d’hospitalisation (JH), la fréquence des admissions dans un service de Réanimation et la létalité des IRVN. Résultats Nous avons relevé 3 957 cas d’infections virales respiratoires soit une fréquence de 5,8 infections/100 admissions (3 957/67 286). Le nombre de cas d’IRVN était de 374 soit une densité d’incidence de 0,65/1000 JH (374/572 231). La répartition par odes virus impliqués dans les cas nosocomiaux est la suivante : influenza virus 44,5 % (166/374), coronavirus 17,5 % (65/374), rhinovirus 17 % (64/374), VRS 11 % (42/374), metapneumovirus 7 % (25/374), parainfluenza 3 % (11/374), adenovirus 0,6 %(1/166). Concernant la gravité des cas d’IRVN sur les 4 périodes : 17 patients atteints d’IRVN ont été admis en Réanimation. Le lien entre l’IRVN et cette admission a été établi pour 3 d’entre eux (2 IRVN à coronavirus et 1 à rhinovirus). Soixante-douze patients atteints d’IRVN sont décédés avec un lien établi entre le décès et l’IRVN pour 4 cas de grippe. La létalité par grippe nosocomiale parmi les 166 patients ateints était donc de 2,4 %. Conclusion Le suivi des IRVN va être pérennisé au sein de notre établissement afin de mettre en évidence des infections nosocomiales non détectées par le système actuel de surveillance. Ces éléments permettront de sensibiliser les professionnels à la prévention de la transmission des infections respiratoires en général et à la vaccination concernant la grippe en particulier.","Cambien, G.; Marco, L.; Leveque, N.; Bousseau, A.; Laland, C.; Castel, O.; Thevenot, S.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,365,16

OBJECTIVE To evaluate if obstructive diseases are risk factors for ICU stay and death due to COVID19. METHODS We collected data from the electronic medical record from 596 adult patients hospitalized in University hospital of Liege between 18th of March and 17th of April 2020 for SARS-CoV2 infection. We classified patients in three groups according to the underlying respiratory disease, present prior to COVID19 pandemics. RESULTS Among patients requiring hospitalization for COVID19, asthma and COPD accounted for 9.6% and 7.7% respectively. The proportions of asthmatics, COPD and patients without obstructive airway disease hospitalized in ICU were 17.5%, 19.6% and 14% respectively. One third of COPD patients died during hospitalization while only 7.0% of asthmatics and 13.6% of patients without airway obstruction died due to SARS-CoV2. The multivariate analysis showed that asthma, COPD, ICS treatment and OCS treatment were not independent risk factors for ICU admission or death. Male gender (OR:1.9; 95%CI: 1.1 to 3.2) and obesity (OR:8.5; 95%CI: 5.1 to 14.1) were predictors of ICU admission while male gender (OR1.9; 95%CI: 1.1-3.2), older age (OR:1.9; 95%CI: 1.6-2.3), cardiopathy (OR: 1.8; 95%CI: 1.1-3.1) and immunosuppressive diseases (OR: 3.6; 95%CI: 1.5-8.4) were independent predictors of death.

This novel strain is highly transmittable and severe disease has been reported in up to 16% of hospitalized cases. More than 600,000 cases have been confirmed and the number of deaths is constantly increasing. COVID-19 hospitalized patients, especially those suffering from severe respiratory or systemic manifestations, fall under the spectrum of the acutely ill medical population, which is at increased venous thromboembolism risk. Thrombotic complications seem to emerge as an important issue in patients infected with COVID-19. Preliminary reports on COVID-19 patients’ clinical and laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer, prolonged prothrombin time, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. As the pandemic is spreading and the whole picture is yet unknown, we highlight the importance of coagulation disorders in COVID-19 infected patients and review relevant data of previous coronavirus epidemics caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).","Giannis, Dimitrios; Ziogas, Ioannis A.; Gianni, Panagiota",J Clin Virol,365,26

The absence of previous knowledge of COVID-19 has made decision-making difficult for all in health care, including surgical departments. We reviewed the management recommendations for surgical activity and changes to surgical practice, identifying concordances and discrepancies, based on the literature published in the early phase of the pandemic. METHOD: We searched the electronic datasets, PubMed Database, Google, and Google Scholar, using the keywords “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “surgery”, “recommendations”, “guideline”, and “triage”. The search was limited to the first 2 months after the pandemic began and was closed on May 6, 2020. RESULTS: Twenty papers were included in the analysis and their recommendations are divided into the following categories: 1. general aspects, such as maintaining the safety of health personnel and indications for surgery. 2. The preoperative phase, with recommendations about activating different care pathways for COVID-19 positive patients. 3. The operative phase, with recommendations about activating safety measures for aerosol-generating procedures. 4. The postoperative phase, with recommendations for managing operating theatres and patient transfers. CONCLUSION: The recommendations proposed in the revised documents are considered good practices aimed at keeping patients and healthcare professionals safe. However, these recommendations must be contextualized in each individual hospital.","Bresadola, Vittorio; Biddau, Carlo; Puggioni, Alessandro; Tel, Alessandro; Robiony, Massimo; Hodgkinson, Jonathan; Leo, Cosimo Alex",Surg Today,365,16

Objective We wished to determine whether asthmatic children requiring emergency department treatment for exacerbations after school return in September were more likely to have respiratory viruses present and less likely to have prescriptions for control medications than children with equally severe asthma not requiring emergent treatment. Methods Rates of viral detection and characteristics of asthma management in 57 (of 60) children age 5 to 15 years presenting to emergency departments with asthma in 2 communities in Canada between September 10 and 30, 2001, (cases) were compared with those in 157 age-matched volunteer children with asthma of comparable severity studied simultaneously (controls). Results Human picornaviruses were detected in 52% of cases and 29% of controls (P =.002) and viruses of any type in 62% of cases and 41% of controls (P =.011). Cases were less likely to have been prescribed controller medication (inhaled corticosteroid, 49% vs 85%; P < .0001; leukotriene receptor antagonist, 9% vs 21%; P =.04). Conclusion Respiratory viruses were detected in the majority of children presenting to emergency departments with asthma during the September epidemic of the disease and in a significant minority of children with asthma in the community. The latter were more likely to have anti-inflammatory medication prescriptions than children requiring emergent treatment. Such medication may reduce the risk of emergency department treatment for asthma during the September epidemic.","Johnston, Neil W.; Johnston, Sebastian L.; Duncan, Joanne M.; Greene, Justina M.; Kebadze, Tatiana; Keith, Paul K.; Roy, Madan; Waserman, Susan; Sears, Malcolm R.",Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,365,20

However, even early treatment might fail to prevent complications in some patients, particularly those infected with novel viruses such as the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1, avian influenza A H5N1 virus subtype, or the avian influenza A H7N9 virus subtype. Furthermore, treatment with one antiviral drug might promote the development of antiviral resistance, especially in immunocompromised hosts and critically ill patients. An obvious strategy to optimise antiviral therapy is to combine drugs with different modes of action. Because host immune responses to infection might also contribute to illness pathogenesis, improved outcomes might be gained from the combination of antiviral therapy with drugs that modulate the immune response in an infected individual. We review available data from preclinical and clinical studies of combination antiviral therapy and of combined antiviral-immunomodulator therapy for influenza. Early-stage data draw attention to several promising antiviral combinations with therapeutic potential in severe infections, but there remains a need to substantiate clinical benefit. Combination therapies with favourable experimental data need to be tested in carefully designed aclinical trials to assess their efficacy.","Dunning, Jake; Baillie, J Kenneth; Cao, Bin; Hayden, Frederick G",Lancet Infect Dis,365,28

Recent in vitro studies revealed that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein plays a prominent role in ACE2 binding, yet a simple and quantitative assay for monitoring this interaction in a cellular environment is lacking. Here, we developed an RBD-ACE2 binding assay that is based on time-resolved FRET, which reliably monitors the interaction in a physiologically relevant and cellular context. Because it is modular, the assay can monitor the impact of different cellular components, such as heparan sulfate, lipids, and membrane proteins on the RBD-ACE2 interaction and it can be extended to the full-length spike protein. The assay is HTS compatible and can detect small-molecule competitive and allosteric modulators of the RBD-ACE2 interaction with high relevance for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.","Cecon, Erika; Burridge, Matilda; Cao, Longxing; Carter, Lauren; Ravichandran, Rashmi; Dam, Julie; Jockers, Ralf",Cell Chem Biol,365,20

Here we examine the performance of nine commonly-used COVID-19 forecasting models, as well as equal- and performance-weighted ensembles, based on their knowledge - i.e., accuracy and precision, and their 'self-knowledge' - i.e., 'calibration' and 'information'. Calibration and information are measures commonly employed in structured expert judgment to assess an expert's ability to meaningfully communicate the extent and limits of their knowledge. Data on observed COVID-19 mortality in 4 states, selected to reflect differences in racial composition and COVID-19 case rates, over eight weeks in the summer of 2020 provided the basis for evaluating model predictions. Only two models showed little bias (geometric mean of observed/predicted < 10%) and good precision (geometric standard deviation of observed/predicted < 1.6). Three models demonstrated good calibration and information. However, only one model exhibited superior performance in both dimensions. Nearly all models under-predicted COVID-19 mortality, some quite substantially. Further, model performance depends on racial composition and case rates, and forecasts in the short-term outperform forecasts in the medium-term on all criteria. The performance-weighted ensembles also outperformed the equal-weighted ensemble on all criteria. The ability of models to accurately and precisely predict mortality and the ability of the modelers to provide meaningful characterizations of the uncertainty in their estimates are potentially important to model developers and to those using model output to inform decisions.","Colonna, K.

Pulmonary dysfunction is the main outcome of COVID‐19 infection. In critically ill patients, however, liver complications have also been reported. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to draw generalized conclusions regarding impaired liver biochemistry and its potential relationship with COVID-19 disease severity. Materials and Methods We searched the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for all the related literature published up to June 20, 2020. The data were analyzed using R statistical software. A random‐effects model was employed for pooling the data. The risk of bias and quality of included studies was assessed using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies. Results The present meta-analysis comprises 10 retrospective and two prospective studies (6,976 COVID-19 patients). The serum analysis revealed significantly higher levels of alanine aminotransferases and aspartate aminotransferases and significantly lower albumin levels. Moreover, insignificant increases in serum levels of total bilirubin were observed. Upon subgroup analysis of six studies (severe cases, n=131; non-severe cases, n=334) stratified on the basis of disease severity, we found that these abnormalities were relatively higher in severe cases of COVID-19 (albumin [weighted mean difference (WMD), 34.03 g/L; 95% CI, 27.42 to 40.63; p<0.0001; I(2)=96.83%); alanine transaminase (ALT) [WMD, 31.66 U/L; 95% CI, 25.07 to 38.25; p<0.0001; I(2)=55.64%]; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) [WMD, 41.79 U/L; 95% CI, 32.85 to 50.72; p<0.0001; I(2)=51.43%]; total bilirubin [WMD, 9.97 μmol/L; 95% CI, 8.46 to 11.48; p<0.0001; I(2)=98%]) than in non-severe cases. Conclusion Deranged liver enzymes serve as prognostic factors to assess the severity of COVID-19.

While there is growing literature on the effects of various variants-of-concern (VOC) on increased transmission, the extent to which VOCs may lead to more severe disease remains debated. Methods: In the current analysis, we use a population-based propensity-score matched cohort study of all incident laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases with VOC testing in Ontario, Canada to estimate healthcare resource use and health outcomes attributable to VOCs introduced to Ontario between January 1 and April 9, 2021, relative to the previously circulating wild-type strain. Results: We find that VOCs are associated with a higher odds of hospitalisation (odds ratio [OR], 2.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.10-2.40) and ICU admission (OR, 3.31; 95%CI, 2.84-3.86); as well as with a higher odds of mortality for both the general COVID-19 population (OR 1.75; 1.47-2.09) and hospitalised cases (OR, 1.62; 95%CI, 1.23-2.15). Conclusion: Taken together, these findings suggest that health systems may face increased demand for healthcare resources as VOCs predominate worldwide in view of low global vaccination coverage.","Erman, A.; Mishra, S.; Barrett, K.; Mac, S.; Naimark, D.

A survey was distributed to a convenience sample (n=504). At the time of the survey, most respondents (68.31%) had been involved in COVID-19 emergency feeding for 3-4 weeks. Results indicated that while most child nutrition professionals did not find food safety easier or more difficult during the initial onset of COVID-19, about 1/3 of respondents were not taking food temperatures during meal service and were not able to obtain the equipment necessary for holding hot foods. Most respondents (60.23%) also indicated that they were not accommodating children with special diets. From a qualitative analysis of open-ended questions relative to special diet accommodation, themes indicated participants had challenges obtaining specialty items, had little time to make accommodations, or had a limited supply from vendors to accommodate these diets.

COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a period of contingency measures, including total or partial lockdowns all over the world leading to several changes in lifestyle/eating behaviours. This retrospective cohort study aimed at investigating Italian adult population lifestyle changes during COVID-19 pandemic “Phase 1” lockdown (8 March–4 May 2020) and discriminate between positive and negative changes and BMI (body mass index) variations (ΔBMI). Methods. A multiple-choice web-form survey was used to collect retrospective data regarding lifestyle/eating behaviours during “Phase 1” in the Italian adult population. According to changes in lifestyle/eating behaviours, the sample was divided into three classes of changes: “negative change”, “no change”, “positive change”. For each class, correlations with ΔBMI were investigated. Results. Data were collected from 1304 subjects (973F/331M). Mean ΔBMI differed significantly (p < 0.001) between classes, and was significantly related to water intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, frequency of “craving or snacking between meals”, dessert/sweets consumption at lunch. Conclusions. During “Phase 1”, many people faced several negative changes in lifestyle/eating behaviours with potential negative impact on health. These findings highlight that pandemic exacerbates nutritional issues and most efforts need to be done to provide nutrition counselling and public health services to support general population needs.","Maffoni, Silvia; Brazzo, Silvia; De Giuseppe, Rachele; Biino, Ginevra; Vietti, Ilaria; Pallavicini, Cristina; Cena, Hellas",Nutrients,365,23

Multiple regions of the country are at high infection prevalence and all areas experienced rapid recent growth of the epidemic during October 2020. Methods REACT-1 is a series of community surveys of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swab-positivity in England designed to monitor the spread of the epidemic and thus increase situational awareness. Round 6 of REACT-1 commenced swab-collection on 16th October. A prior interim report included data from 16th to 25th October for 85,971 participants. Here, we report data for the entire round on 160,175 participants with swab results obtained up to 2nd November 2020. Results Overall weighted prevalence of infection in the community in England was 1.3% or 130 people per 10,000 infected, up from 60 people per 10,000 in the round 5 report (18th September to 5th October 2020), doubling every 24 days on average since the prior round. The corresponding R number was estimated to be 1.2. Prevalence of infection was highest in North West (2.4%, up from 1.2% ), followed by Yorkshire and The Humber (2.3% up from 0.84%), West Midlands (1.6% up from 0.60%), North East (1.5% up from 1.1%), East Midlands (1.3% up from 0.56%), London (0.97%, up from 0.54%), South West (0.80% up from 0.33%), South East (0.69% up from 0.29%), and East of England (0.69% up from 0.30%). Rapid growth in the South observed in the first half of round 6 was no longer apparent in the second half of round 6. We also observed a decline in prevalence in Yorkshire and The Humber during this period. Comparing the first and second halves of round 6, there was a suggestion of decline in weighted prevalence in participants aged 5 to 12 years and in those aged 25 to 44 years. While prevalence remained high, in the second half of round 6 there was suggestion of a slight fall then rise that was seen nationally and also separately in both the North and the South. Conclusion The impact of the second national lockdown in England is not yet known. We provide here a detailed description of swab-positivity patterns at national, regional and local scales for the period immediately preceding lockdown, against which future trends in prevalence can be evaluated.","Riley, S.; Ainslie, K.

Tumors with any gene mutations (any gene mutations in KRAS/NRAS/BRAF), KRAS and KRAS codon 12 mutation were more likely to be located in right-sided colon (P=0.007, P=0.008, P=0.026, respectively). For metastasis, tumors with any gene mutations, KRAS and KRAS codon 12 mutation were significantly correlated with peritoneal metastasis (P=0.019, P=0.017, P=0.014, respectively), liver-peritoneum metastases (P=0.004, P=0.003, P=0.002, respectively) and multi-organ metastases (P=0.002, P=0.008, P=0.001, respectively). Tumors with all wild type were significantly correlated with distant lymph node-only metastasis. No statistically significant differences were found between clinicopathological characteristics and KRAS codon 13 and NRAS mutations. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that clinicopathological characteristics (specifically for metastasis) are related to KRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutations in therapy-naïve synchronous mCRC population in China. We demonstrated that distant lymph node-only metastasis is visibly linked to all wild-type tumors. We found that patients with any gene mutations, KRAS mutation are more likely to carry peritoneal metastasis, liver-peritoneum metastases and multi-organ metastases than those with all wild type. After stratification, KRAS codon 12 mutation, but not codon 13 mutation, was remarkably associated with peritoneal metastasis, liver-peritoneum metastases, and multi-organ metastases compared to all wild type. These results may be useful for aiding in the prediction of prognosis and choosing the appropriate regimens for therapy.","He, Kang; Wang, Yajing; Zhong, Yuejiao; Pan, Xiaohua; Si, Lixiang; Lu, Jianwei",Onco Targets Ther,365,1

T-1105 and T-705 are antiviral RNA nucleobase analogues that selectively inhibit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. They are expected as a drug candidate against various viral infections, including COVID-19. The pyrazine moiety was decomposed by O(2)(•–) through proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). Our results show that its active form, pyrazine-ribofuranosyl-5′-triphosphate, is easily oxidized under inflamed organs by overproduced O(2)(•–) through the PCET mechanism in the immune system. This mechanistic study implies that the oxidative degradation of pyrazine derivatives will be prevented by controlling the PCET through simple modification of the pyrazine structure.","Nakayama, Tatsushi; Honda, Ryo",ACS Omega,365,26

This study evaluated the delivery of teletherapy from the perspectives of parents and therapists. Methods: Participants consisted of parents (n = 47) and therapists (n = 102) of children with developmental disorders who were receiving teletherapy during the lockdown. A mixed-methods triangulation design-convergence model was adopted; participants were invited to respond to an online survey with closed- and open-ended questions. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and non-parametric inferential tests, while qualitative data were examined using thematic analysis. Results: Overall satisfaction with teletherapy was positive, with parents reporting significantly higher satisfaction compared to therapists. Satisfaction was positively associated with the frequency of teletherapy sessions for parents, and with their years of experience for therapists. The top enabling factors were family participation and effective communication. The main challenges were time constraints and difficulty with instruction and monitoring associated with the two-dimensional nature of teletherapy. The benefits included empowerment of parents and enhanced understanding of the needs of their children. Discussion: The shift to teletherapy facilitated a heightened focus on family-centered care. The evaluation findings suggest that the general satisfaction with teletherapy and the benefits associated with family-centered care will likely promote teletherapy as a service delivery mode to continue beyond the pandemic.","Eguia, K.

Thus, we investigated the presence of the 2019-new coronavirus in different urban wastewater samples and, later, evaluated the behavioral and biochemical effects of the exposure of Culex quinquefasciatus larvae to two SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptides (PSPD-2002 and PSPD-2003) synthesized in our laboratory. Initially, our results show the contamination of wastewater by the new coronavirus, via RT-qPCR on the viral N1 gene. On the other hand, our study shows that short-term exposure (48 h) to a low concentration (40 μg/L) of the synthesized peptides induced changes in the locomotor and the olfactory-driven behavior of the C. quinquefascitus larvae, which were associated with increased production of ROS and AChE activity (cholinesterase effect). To our knowledge, this is the first study that reports the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the larval phase of a freshwater invertebrate species.

Plusieurs résidents d’un grand camp de Roms originaires de Moldavie (composé de plus de 600 habitants) ont été hospitalisés pour des formes sévères de COVID-19. L’objectif de ce travail est de dresser le bilan de l’intervention mise en place et de décrire la séroprévalence du Covid-19 sur le camp en post-épidémie. Matériels et méthodes Fin mars, une « équipe mobile précarité Covid » hospitalière multidisciplinaire a été créée pour intervenir quotidiennement directement sur les camps et détecter et prendre en charge les cas probables de COVID-19. En post-épidémie, une action de dépistage sérologique du COVID-19, de la varicelle (chez les 11–40 ans sans antécédents) et du VIH-VHB-VHC a été réalisée. Une analyse descriptive des données cliniques et biologiques recueillies est présentée. Résultats L’équipe mobile est intervenue quotidiennement sur le camp du 31/03 au 27/05 (43 interventions) et a effectué un total de 841 consultations dont 128 (15,2 %) pour Covid probable et 106 (12,6 %) pour Covid possible (toux sans fièvre, rhinite). Vingt-deux patients (2,6 %) ont été évacués sur les urgences et 7 ont été secondairement hospitalisés. Seuls 4 cas de Covid probables ou prouvés ont accepté un hébergement en centre Covid, tous les autres ayant refusé. Sur la période, 42 cas ont été confirmés par PCR lorsqu’ils étaient hospitalisés ou quand les PCR ont pu être réalisées par l’équipe mobile à partir de mi-avril. La majorité des consultations sollicitées par les habitants du camp concernait des pathologies variées autres (diabète, HTA, grossesse, ectoparasitose, viroses infantiles, etc.). Suite à l’hospitalisation d’un cas de varicelle, à l’incertitude sur le niveau d’immunité varicelle et Covid et à la disponibilité des tests sérologiques sur l’hôpital, il a été décidé de réaliser une action de dépistage et de vaccination large sur une durée de 10jours (25/5–5/6). Parmi les 211 personnes prélevées (65 % de femmes, âge médian 42 ans [26–51], 26≤18 ans), la séroprévalence du contact avec le SARS-CoV2 est de 75,6 % (152/211), du VIH de 3,5 % (6/170 dont 2 femmes enceinte), du VHC de 10,6 % (17/160), de l’AgHBs de 1,8 % (3/164) et de la varicelle de 92,21 % (71/77). Conclusion Ce large camps de Roms a fait face à une épidémie massive de SARS-CoV-2 qui n’a pas pu être prévenue mais a pu être gérée directement sur le camp par une équipe d’aller vers. Le diagnostic récent de 4 cas PCR+ questionne le seuil d’immunité de groupe.

This study describes the spatiotemporal patterns of publicly announced school closures implemented in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and assesses how public K-12 districts adjusted their methods of education delivery and provision of subsidized meals. During February 18-June 30, 2020, we used daily systematic media searches to identify publicly announced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related school closures lasting [≥]1 day in the United States (US). We also collected statewide school closure policies from state government websites. Data on distance learning and subsidized meal programs were collected from a stratified sample of 600 school districts. The first COVID-19-associated school closure occurred on February 27, 2020 in Washington state. By March 30, 2020, all but one US public school districts were closed, representing the first-ever nearly synchronous nationwide closure of public K-12 schools in the US. Approximately 100,000 public schools were closed for [≥]8 weeks because of COVID-19, affecting >50 million K-12 students. Of 600 districts sampled, the vast majority offered distance learning (91.0%) and continued provision of subsidized meal programs (78.8%) during the closures. Despite the sudden and prolonged nature of COVID-19-associated school closures, schools demonstrated flexibility by implementing distance learning and alternate methods to continue subsidized meal programs.","Zviedrite, N.; Hodis, J.

Reports suggest that athletes are seeking mental health support, showing the pressures of boredom, and tension associated with their anticipated social isolation. The current study seeks to evaluate the evidence regarding the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on occupational stress in professional athletes. Method: A scoping review was conducted. A comprehensive search involving Embase and PubMed databases was conducted using a combination of the following key words: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, and athletes. In this study, articles were retained if they were original studies reporting on the impact of the pandemic on professional athletes. Results: Nine studies were identified as they investigated the impact of the pandemic on athletes. Most were observational and cross-sectional, and one was longitudinal. Outcome measures mainly investigated were level of depression, anxiety, and stress. Dependent variables were physical activity, nutrition, mental state, sleep quality, individual well-being, social identity, exclusivity, negative affectivity, alcohol consumption, psychological distress, and gambling habits. Conclusions: This review highlights the need for proactive engagement with professional athletes, coaches, trainers, and sports councils to facilitate understanding and awareness-raising, process optimization, and delivery of consistent training and psychosocial aid and occupational therapy programs that maintain the health and well-being of athletes while minimizing occupational stress during a pandemic.","Haan, Raven; Ali Alblooshi, Mariyam Essa; Syed, Dawood Hasan; Dougman, Khaled Khalifa; Al Tunaiji, Hashel; Campos, Luciana Aparecida; Baltatu, Ovidiu Constantin",Front Public Health,365,20

However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. In addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. Finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the Complementary Exposure pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human protein-protein interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations toward future clinical trials for HCoVs.","Zhou, Yadi; Hou, Yuan; Shen, Jiayu; Huang, Yin; Martin, William; Cheng, Feixiong",,365,11

Based on three waves of census data (2006, 2011 and 2016), combined with our spatial–temporal urban environmental database consisting of three local datasets of urban climate and air quality, this paper assesses the impacts of social, economic and environmental factors on the logarithm of housing prices in Hong Kong through linear regression analysis. Specifically, both supply- and demand-side economic factors have significant impacts on housing prices. Demographic factors are not as significant as expected in affecting housing prices. Transportation factors have more significant effects in the short run than in the long run. Environmental factors, including the number of hot night hours, Annual Air Quality Index (AAQI) of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and particulates with particle sizes less than 10 microns (PM(10)), significantly affect housing prices over time. The results have important implications: current policy instruments to prevent housing price escalation are focused on increasing property tax or land supply (economic factors), while little attention is paid to social or environmental factors, which are geographically heterogeneous. Our findings suggest that housing provision in the New Territories may be a feasible solution to alleviate the housing crisis as its demographic pattern, transportation connectivity and air quality are significantly different from Hong Kong Island or Kowloon Peninsula. In regard to urban environmental problems brought by the high-density development in Hong Kong despite land-use saving, intensified urban infrastructure and promotion of public transportation, our study contributes to the understanding of its housing price dynamics from a more holistic perspective by comparing the impacts of economic, social and environmental factors.","Jing, Li; Weixuan, Fang; Yuan, Shi; Chao, Ren",J Hous Built Environ,365,13

Concurrently, the relationship between eudaimonic entertainment processes and self-expansion, particularly feeling moved and self-awareness, was examined. A quasi-experiment was conducted with an online sample (N = 172) that was randomly assigned to watch either a tragic drama or comedy. Results showed that key TEBOTS predictions were largely confirmed for boundary expansion and the outcomes of narrative engagement and entertainment gratifications. Although identity threat was negatively associated with positive coping with the pandemic, this relationship turned positive when mediated by boundary expansion. Further, exposure to tragedy raised feelings of “being moved,” which, in turn, was linked to self-perceptual depth and expanded boundaries of the self downstream.

Considering the access barriers to quality rehabilitation settings and services imposed by social distancing and stay-at-home orders, these patients can be benefited from providing access to affordable and good quality care through home-based rehabilitation. The success of such treatment will depend highly on the intensity of the therapy and effort invested by the patient. Monitoring patients' compliance and designing a home-based rehabilitation that can mentally engage them are the critical elements in home-based therapy's success. Hence, we study the state-of-the-art telerehabilitation frameworks and robotic devices, and comment about a hybrid model that can use existing telerehabilitation framework and home-based robotic devices for treatment and simultaneously assess patient's progress remotely. Second, we comment on the patients' social support and engagement, which is critical for the success of telerehabilitation service. As the therapists are not physically present to guide the patients, we also discuss the adaptability requirement of home-based telerehabilitation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who were referred to our clinic with active CS from 31st March to 15th May 2020 were screened for COVID-19 using real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Late-night serum cortisol (64–327 nmol/L), late-night salivary cortisol (LNSC) (0.5–9.4 nmol/L), or 24-h urinary free cortisol (24 hUFC) (100–379 nmol/24 h) were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. RESULTS: Among 22 patients with active CS we found three cases affected by COVID-19. Nonspecific inflammation markers were within the reference range or slightly elevated in these patients. A 71-year-old woman with newly diagnosed CS (late-night serum cortisol >1750 nmol/L, LNSC 908.6 nmol/L) developed dyspnea as an only symptom and died from bilateral polysegmantal hemorrhagic pneumonia 7 days later. A 38-year-old woman with a 5-year medical history of active Cushing’s disease (CD) (late-night serum cortisol 581.3 nmol/L, 24 hUFC 959.7 nmol/24-h) suffered from dyspnea, cough, fever (39.3 °C) and chest pain. Oxygen therapy, antibiotics and symptomatic treatments lead to full recovery 24 days later. A 66-year-old woman with a 4-year medical history of mild CD (late-night serum cortisol 603.4 nmol/L, LNSC 10.03 nmol/L) tested positive for COVID-19 in routine screening and remained asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of COVID-19 in patients with CS depends on the severity of hypercortisolism. Thus, severe hypercortisolism is a warning sign that CS affected by COVID-19 could require emergency care despite a lack of clinical presentations and low inflammation biomarkers.","Belaya, Zhanna; Golounina, Olga; Melnichenko, Galina; Tarbaeva, Natalia; Pashkova, Evgenia; Gorokhov, Maxim; Kalashnikov, Viktor; Dzeranova, Larisa; Fadeev, Valentin; Volchkov, Pavel; Dedov, Ivan",Endocrine,365,6

However, data-driven analyses of the socioeconomic determinants of COVID-19 burden are still needed. Using data from New York City (NYC), we aimed to determine how socioeconomic factors impact human mobility and COVID-19 burden. Methods/Summary: New York City has a large amount of heterogeneity in socioeconomic status (SES) and demographics among neighborhoods. We used this heterogeneity to conduct a cross-sectional spatial analysis of the associations between human mobility (i.e., subway ridership), sociodemographic factors, and COVID-19 incidence as of April 26, 2020. We also conducted a secondary analysis of NYC boroughs (which are equivalent to counties in the city) to assess the relationship between the decline in subway use and the time it took for each borough to end the exponential growth period of COVID-19 cases. Findings: Areas with the lower median income, a greater percentage of individuals who identify as non-white and/or Hispanic/Latino, a greater percentage of essential workers, and a greater percentage of healthcare workers had more subway use during the pandemic. The positive associations between subway use and median income, and between subway use and percent non-white and/or Hispanic/Latino do not remain when adjusted for the percent of essential workers. This suggests essential work is what drives subway use in lower SES zip codes and communities of color. Increased subway use was associated with a higher rate of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population when adjusted for testing effort (aRR=1.11; 95% CI: 1.03 - 1.19), but this association was weaker once we adjusted for median income (aRR=1.06; 95% CI: 1.00 - 1.12). All sociodemographic variables were significantly associated with the rate of positive cases per 100,000 population when adjusting for testing effort (except percent uninsured) and adjusting for both income and testing effort. The risk factor with the strongest association with COVID-19 was the percent of individuals in essential work (aRR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.36 - 1.86). We found that subway use declined prior to any executive order, and there was an estimated 28-day lag between the onset of reduced subway use and the end of the exponential growth period of SARS-CoV-2 within New York City boroughs. Interpretation: Our results suggest that the ability to stay home during the pandemic has been constrained by SES and work circumstances. Poorer neighborhoods are not afforded the same reductions in mobility as their richer counterparts. Furthermore, lower SES neighborhoods have higher disease burdens, which may be due to inequities in ability to shelter-in-place, and/or due to the plethora of other existing health disparities that increase vulnerability to COVID-19. Furthermore, the extended lag time between the dramatic fall in subway ridership and the end of the exponential growth phase for COVID-19 cases is important for future policy, because it demonstrates that if there is a resurgence, and stay-at-home orders are re-issued, then cities can expect to wait a month before reported cases will plateau.","Sy, K.

Another related challenge arises in dealing with the large number of what–if scenarios that need to be explored. Here, we describe new computational methods that together provide an approach to dealing with both challenges. A mesoscopic modeling approach is described that strikes a middle ground between macroscopic models based on coupled differential equations and microscopic models built on fine-grained behaviors at the individual entity level. The mesoscopic approach offers the ability to incorporate complex compositions of multiple layers of dynamics even while retaining the potential for aggregate behaviors at varying levels. It also is an excellent match to the accelerator-based architectures of modern computing platforms in which graphical processing units (GPUs) can be exploited for fast simulation via the parallel execution mode of single instruction multiple thread (SIMT). The challenge of simulating a large number of scenarios is addressed via a method of sharing model state and computation across a tree of what–if scenarios that are localized, incremental changes to a large base simulation. A combination of the mesoscopic modeling approach and the incremental what–if scenario tree evaluation has been implemented in the software on modern GPUs. Synthetic simulation scenarios are presented to demonstrate the computational characteristics of our approach. Results from the experiments with large population data, including USA, UK, and India, illustrate the modeling methodology and computational performance on thousands of synthetically generated what–if scenarios. Execution of our implementation scaled to 8192 GPUs of supercomputing platforms demonstrates the ability to rapidly evaluate what–if scenarios several orders of magnitude faster than the conventional methods.","Perumalla, Kalyan S.; Alam, Maksudul",J Indian Inst Sci,365,17

Since then it caused several outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever in humans with case fatality rates up to 90% and remains a serious Public Health concern and biothreat pathogen. The most pathogenic and best-studied species is Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV). EBOV encodes one viral surface glycoprotein (GP), which is essential for replication, a determinant of pathogenicity and an important immunogen. GP mediates viral entry through interaction with cellular surface molecules, which results in the uptake of virus particles via macropinocytosis. Later in this pathway endosomal acidification activates the cysteine proteases Cathepsin B and L (CatB, CatL), which have been shown to cleave ZEBOV-GP leading to subsequent exposure of the putative receptor-binding and fusion domain and productive infection. We studied the effect of CatB and CatL on in vitro and in vivo replication of EBOV. Similar to previous findings, our results show an effect of CatB, but not CatL, on ZEBOV entry into cultured cells. Interestingly, cell entry by other EBOV species (Bundibugyo, Côte d'Ivoire, Reston and Sudan ebolavirus) was independent of CatB or CatL as was EBOV replication in general. To investigate whether CatB and CatL have a role in vivo during infection, we utilized the mouse model for ZEBOV. Wild-type (control), catB(−/−) and catL(−/−) mice were equally susceptible to lethal challenge with mouse-adapted ZEBOV with no difference in virus replication and time to death. In conclusion, our results show that CatB and CatL activity is not required for EBOV replication. Furthermore, EBOV glycoprotein cleavage seems to be mediated by an array of proteases making targeted therapeutic approaches difficult.","Marzi, Andrea; Reinheckel, Thomas; Feldmann, Heinz",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,365,24

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The search for international literature was made including articles written in English and reporting about oral manifestations in patients with a diagnosis of COVID‐19. The publication time was limited to 2019 and 2020, up to May 20, 2020. A narrative review was performed. RESULTS: Twenty‐three articles were included in this review. Three different oral manifestations were found: taste alteration, oral blister and ulcers, and oral lesions associated with Kawasaki‐like diseases (erythema, bleeding of lips, “strawberry tongue”). The higher expression of Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 in the oral cavity and in endothelial cells might be responsible for oral manifestation and the major report of signs and symptoms in the occidental countries. CONCLUSIONS: Detecting oral signs and symptoms of COVID‐19 could be useful to perform a better preliminary triage in dental setting, and in recognizing possible early manifestations of the disease. However, considering the outbreak of COVID‐19 and the consequent difficulty of undergoing oral examinations, the oral manifestations might be misdiagnosed; then, we would encourage oral professionals to perform other studies about this topic.","Capocasale, Giorgia; Nocini, Riccardo; Faccioni, Paolo; Donadello, Dario; Bertossi, Dario; Albanese, Massimo; Zotti, Francesca",Clin Exp Dent Res,365,26

X-ray structures of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) enzymes in complex with multiple ML300-based inhibitors, including the original probe ML300, were obtained and proved instrumental in guiding chemistry toward probe compound 41 (CCF0058981). The disclosed inhibitors utilize a noncovalent mode of action and complex in a noncanonical binding mode not observed by peptidic 3CL(pro) inhibitors. In vitro DMPK profiling highlights key areas where further optimization in the series is required to obtain useful in vivo probes. Antiviral activity was established using a SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cell viability assay and a plaque formation assay. Compound 41 demonstrates nanomolar activity in these respective assays, comparable in potency to remdesivir.

In this regard, immunoinformatics may aid to predict prominent immunogenic regions from critical SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, such as the spike (S) glycoprotein, for their use in prophylactic or therapeutic interventions against this rapidly emerging coronavirus. Accordingly, in this study, an integrated immunoinformatics approach was applied to identify cytotoxic T cell (CTC), T helper cell (THC), and Linear B cell (BC) epitopes from the S glycoprotein in an attempt to design a high-quality multi-epitope vaccine. The best CTC, THC, and BC epitopes showed high viral antigenicity, lack of allergenic or toxic residues, and suitable HLA-viral peptide interactions. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its receptor-binding motif (RBM) harbour several potential epitopes. The structure prediction, refinement, and validation data indicate that the multi-epitope vaccine has an appropriate conformation and stability. Three conformational epitopes and an efficient binding between Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the vaccine model were observed. Importantly, the population coverage analysis showed that the multi-epitope vaccine could be used globally. Notably, computer-based simulations suggest that the vaccine model has a robust potential to evoke and maximize both immune effector responses and immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2. Further research is needed to accomplish with the mandatory international guidelines for human vaccine formulations. Graphical Abstract","Marchan, Jose",bioRxiv,365,30

METHODS: We performed a machine learning cluster analysis of common biomarkers in patients admitted with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 to determine if any were associated with AIS. Findings were validated using aggregate data from 3 large healthcare systems. RESULTS: Clustering grouped 2908 unique patient encounters into 4 unique biomarker phenotypes based on levels of c-reactive protein, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, white blood cell count, and partial thromboplastin time. The most severe cluster phenotype had the highest prevalence of AIS (3.6%, P<0.001), in-hospital AIS (53%, P<0.002), severe AIS (31%, P=0.004), and cryptogenic AIS (73%, P<0.001). D-dimer was the only biomarker independently associated with prevalent AIS with quartile 4 having an 8-fold higher risk of AIS compared to quartile 1 (P=0.005), a finding that was further corroborated in a separate cohort of 157 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and AIS. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-associated ischemic stroke may be related to COVID-19 illness severity and associated coagulopathy as defined by increasing D-dimer burden.","Esenwa, Charles; Cheng, Natalie T; Luna, Jorge; Willey, Joshua; Boehme, Amelia K; Kirchoff-Torres, Kathryn; Labovitz, Daniel; Liberman, Ava L; Mabie, Peter; Moncrieffe, Khadean; Soetanto, Ainie; Lendaris, Andrea; Seiden, Johanna; Goldman, Inessa; Altschul, David; Holland, Ryan; Benton, Joshua; Dardick, Joseph; Fernandez-Torres, Jenelys; Flomenbaum, David; Lu, Jenny; Malaviya, Avinash; Patel, Nikunj; Toma, Aureliana; Lord, Aaron; Ishida, Koto; Torres, Jose; Snyder, Thomas; Frontera, Jennifer; Yaghi, Shadi",Stroke,365,25

To address this unmet medical need, we screened 5,406 compounds, including United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved drugs and bioactives, for activity against a South Korean Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) clinical isolate. Among 221 identified hits, 54 had therapeutic indexes (TI) greater than 6. Time-of-addition studies with selected drugs demonstrated eight and four FDA-approved drugs acted on the early and late stages of the viral life cycle, respectively. Confirmed hits included several cardiotonic agents (TI>100), atovaquone, an anti-malarial (TI>34), and ciclosonide, an inhalable corticosteroid (TI>6). Furthermore, utilizing the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), combinations of remedesivir with selected dugs were evaluated, which identified ciclosonide and nelfinavir to be additive and synergistic drugs in vitro, respectively. Together, we screened FDA-approved drugs using patient-derived MERS-CoV, triaged hits to discriminate between early and late viral life cycle inhibitors, confirmed selected drugs using SARS-CoV-2, and demonstrated the added value of selected medications in combination with remedesivir.

These complications from exposure to critical care are termed post-intensive care syndrome-family (PICS-f). Psychological repercussions of critical illness affect the family member's ability to perform care functions after hospitalisation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 37 family members of patients hospitalised in an ICU were included. To evaluate the level stress, anxiety, depression and basic hope the standardized questionnaires the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Basic Hope Inventory (BHI-12) respectively were used. RESULTS: In 33 respondents (89.19%) a high level of stress was identified, and 14 (37.84%) and 12 (32.43%) respondents had severe anxiety and depression, respectively. Higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression were found in spouses and family members living with the patient. Female subjects had a higher level of basic hope (P = 0.026). It was found that perceived stress correlated with anxiety (r = 0.456, P = 0.005) and depression (r = 0.481, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Most relatives of the patients reported stress, anxiety, depression and low basic hope.

The secondary aim was to analyze factors associated with rDDIs. An observational single center cohort study conducted at a tertiary hospital in Spain from March 1st to April 30th. rDDIs refer to interaction with concomitant drugs prescribed during hospital stay whereas potential DDIs (pDDIs) refer to those with domiciliary medication. DDIs checked with The University of Liverpool resource. Concomitant medications were categorized according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Binomial logistic regression was carried out to identify factors associated with rDDIs. A total of 174 patients were analyzed. DDIs were detected in 152 patients (87.4%) with a total of 417 rDDIs between COVID19-related drugs and involved hospital concomitant medication (60 different drugs) while pDDIs were detected in 105 patients (72.9%) with a total of 553 pDDIs. From all 417 rDDIs, 43.2% (n = 180) were associated with lopinavir/ritonavir and 52.9% (n = 221) with hydroxychloroquine, both of them the most prescribed (106 and 165 patients, respectively).
