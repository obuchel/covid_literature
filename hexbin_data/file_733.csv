A model composed of two interacting complex networks is proposed to describe cooperative spreading processes, wherein the virus spreading in one layer can penetrate into the other to promote the spreading process. The global epidemic threshold of the model is smaller than the epidemic thresholds of the corresponding isolated networks. Thus, global epidemic onset arises in the interacting networks even though an epidemic onset does not arise in each isolated network. Simulations verify the analysis results and indicate that cooperative spreading processes in multiplex networks enhance the final infection fraction.","Wei, Xiang; Chen, Shihua; Wu, Xiaoqun; Ning, Di; Lu, Jun-an",Chaos,733,1

The conflicting role of innate immunity in the antitumor activity of oncolytic viruses is still a matter of debate. The STING-dependent DNA sensing axis is considered detrimental for viral replication and cancer cell clearance. Accordingly, we observed that STING loss in tumor cells was associated with improved lytic potential by a herpes-based oncolytic virus. However, STING-knockout cancer cells infected with the oncolytic virus showed impaired immunogenicity, as immunogenic cell death was improperly triggered. In agreement with these observations, STING-knockout tumors raised in a murine syngeneic model were more resistant to a combined treatment of the oncolytic virus with PD-1 blockade. The present study demonstrates the antitumor benefit of antiviral immunity and sheds lights on the mechanisms of immune resistance to oncovirotherapy exerted by STING-loss in tumor cells. ABSTRACT: The dichotomic contribution of cancer cell lysis and tumor immunogenicity is considered essential for effective oncovirotherapy, suggesting that the innate antiviral immune response is a hurdle for efficacy of oncolytic viruses. However, emerging evidence is resizing this view. By sensing cytosolic DNA, the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) axis can both counteract viral spread and contribute to the elicitation of adaptive immunity via type I interferon responses. In this paper, we analyzed the tumor-resident function of Sting-mediated DNA sensing in a combined approach of oncovirotherapy and PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade, in an immunocompetent murine model. While supporting increased lytic potential by oncolytic HER2-retargeted HSV-1 in vitro and in vivo, Sting-knockout tumors showed molecular signatures of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These signatures were correspondingly associated with ineffectiveness of the combination therapy in a model of established tumors. Results suggest that the impairment in antiviral response of Sting-knockout tumors, while favoring viral replication, is not able to elicit an adequate immunotherapeutic effect, due to lack of immunogenic cell death and the inability of Sting-knockout cancer cells to promote anti-tumor adaptive immune responses. Accordingly, we propose that antiviral, tumor-resident Sting provides fundamental contributions to immunotherapeutic efficacy of oncolytic viruses.","Froechlich, Guendalina; Caiazza, Carmen; Gentile, Chiara; D’Alise, Anna Morena; De Lucia, Maria; Langone, Francesca; Leoni, Guido; Cotugno, Gabriella; Scisciola, Vittorio; Nicosia, Alfredo; Scarselli, Elisa; Mallardo, Massimo; Sasso, Emanuele; Zambrano, Nicola",Cancers (Basel),733,8

Biology: the age and sex of the person; the genetic makeup including heritable diseases. At the current time, biological factors are the hardest to change, although many are hopeful that genetic engineering may change this at some point. For this reason, most public-sector investment in public health aims to affect the behavioral, social, environmental and medical access determinants. . 2. Behaviors: alcohol, tobacco, substance abuse; risk-prone lifestyles, such as working as a miner or prostitute. . 3. Social: discrimination, income disparities, socioeconomic status, education, occupation, class, social support. Poorer people often lack time and opportunity to exercise. Food for a healthier diet tends to be more expensive and takes longer to prepare. A strong and consistent finding of epidemiological research is that there are health differences among socioeconomic groups. Lower mortality, morbidity, and disability rates among socioeconomically advantaged people have been observed for hundreds of years. . 4. Environment (or total ecology): where a person lives, sanitary and crowding conditions, air and water quality, lead exposure, and the design of neighborhoods. Some of the most dramatic improvements in population health during the twentieth century include: improved water, food, and milk sanitation, reduced physical crowding, improved nutrition, and central heating with cleaner fuels. Most Americans live in urban areas, which are often associated with harmful health behaviors, such as exercise, diet, sexual behavior, alcohol and substance abuse. Cities also have higher levels of air pollution, which may cause cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Crowded buildings may increase the risk of lead exposure as well as asthma. Those that live in rural areas have other risks, such as exposure to pesticides. . 5. Medical care: access to quality health care; having insurance. For example, the availability of Medicaid (health insurance for the poor) was expanded greatly with the passage of the Affordable Care Act. This resulted in greater access to medical care for a previously underserved population. Similarly, the nationwide shift to high-deductible insurance plans has actually reduced accessibility to affordable healthcare for many. ;","Mankowitz, Scott",Clinical Informatics Board Review and Self Assessment,733,17

Epiglottitis is a bacterial infection, while viruses cause nearly all cases of acute laryngitis and croup. Acute laryngitis in adults is usually self-limited. Epiglottitis, which used to be prevalent in children under age 5, is now seen more often in adults than in children. This decline in childhood epiglottitis is due to the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine. Streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, are now important causes of epiglottitis. Croup is a viral infection, usually due to parainfluenza virus, that primarily affects children ages 6 months to 3 years old. Epiglottitis and croup can cause life-threatening loss of the airway, and misdiagnosis or mismanagement can result in fatalities.

Particularly, patients with traumatic lung injury and posttraumatic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have a high risk of bleeding during this procedure. This study aimed to determine the safety and feasibility of ECMO in patients with traumatic ARDS. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records and investigated the clinical outcomes of ECMO in 42 patients with traumatic ARDS, among whom near-drowning (42.9%) was the most frequent cause of injury. RESULTS: Thirty-four of 42 patients (81%) survived and were discharged after a median hospital stay of 23 days. A multivariate analysis identified a lactate level (odds ratio: 1.493, 95% confidence interval: 1.060–2.103, P = 0.022) and veno-venous (VV) ECMO (odds ratio: 0.075, 95% confidence interval: 0.006–0.901, P = 0.041) as favorable independent predictors of survival in patients with traumatic ARDS who underwent ECMO. The optimal cut off value for pre-ECMO lactate level was 10.5 mmol/L (area under the curve = 0.929, P = 0.001). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the survival rate at hospital discharge was significant higher among the patients with a pre-ECMO lactate level of 10.5 mmol/L or less compared with patients with pre-ECMO lactate level greater than 10.5 mmol/L (93.8% versus 40.0%, respectively; P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: ECMO yielded excellent survival outcomes, particularly in patients with low pre-treatment lactate levels who received VV ECMO. Therefore, ECMO appears safe and highly feasible in a carefully selected population of trauma patients.","Lee, Hong Kyu; Kim, Hyoung Soo; Ha, Sang Ook; Park, Sunghoon; Lee, Hee Sung; Lee, Soo Kyung; Lee, Sun Hee",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,733,13

In the Min-Degree Steiner k-Tree problem we are given a set R of terminals and an integer k, and T should contain k terminals. In both problems the goal is to minimize the maximum degree of T. In the more general Degrees Bounded Min-Cost Group Steiner Tree problem, we are also given edge costs and individual degree bounds [Formula: see text].

There are many microbes that temporarily “stun” innate and/or adaptive immunity during a primary infection. The common result of temporary inhibition, or permanent depletion of host immunity during some primary infections is the development of superinfections of other microbes that cause significant morbidity, and on occasion, mortality. In addition, microbes that cause persistent infection, such as the human immune deficiency virus, deplete effective immunity over time and can also lead to secondary infections with other microbes ultimately leading to death if not appropriately treated. In some cases, such as influenza virus infection, mortality can be dramatic due in large part to acquired secondary bacterial infections. Many microbes manipulate host immunity and thereby inhibit the ability of patients to combat secondary microbial infections. The overall survival of patients primarily infected with some viruses, parasites, or bacteria, is closely linked to the ability of secondary infections to take advantage of the immune modulation induced by the primary infection. Herein we discuss some of the secondary immune defects caused by select viruses (measles, influenza, HIV1, HTLV), parasites, (leishmania, malaria), and bacteria (Bordetella pertussis). Furthermore, the genetic susceptibility of a given host to become infected, or develop severe disease, also determines whether an infected individual who becomes infected with a secondary microbe survives. Future studies are needed to explore not only the immunomodulation caused by select microbes, but also the repertoire of immune responses expressed by infected individuals in order to predict clinical outcomes of these infections. Thus, understanding the delicate balance that exists between “immune altering” microbes that suppress immune responses during primary infections leading to severe secondary infections versus those infections found in patients with inborn errors of innate or adaptive immunity, is essential in predicting the clinical outcome and the appropriate treatment for these two different patient populations.","Bonagura, Vincent Robert; Rosenthal, David Walter",Stiehm's Immune Deficiencies,733,1

In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of OBI in immunized children with HBsAg-positive parents. METHODS: HBV-vaccinated Chinese hospitalized children with HBsAg-positive parents were analyzed in our investigation. Eligible subjects were tested using a standard nested PCR for all HBV genes, and analyzed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: There were 327 HBsAg-negative children included in the study out of about 9800 involved HBV-vaccinated hospitalized children. The positive rate of OBI was 3.1% (10/327) in the eligible children and 14.1% (46/327) with HBV DNA detectable. No significant differences were found between one and at least two regions positive groups (p > 0.05). The proportions of HBV DNA detectable in children with HBV father-carriers and mother-carriers were similar. The risk factors for HBV DNA-positive children could be male, anti-HBs levels, and anti-HBc positive. CONCLUSION: There are 3.1% of OBIs and 14.1% of suspected OBI in vaccinated children with HBsAg-positive parents. The potential risk of suspected OBI in children with HBsAg-positive father should not be ignored. Anti-HBc positivity may be a useful seromarker for suspected OBI screening in vaccinated children.

These systems are modelled in the framework of team automata in which any number of components can participate—as a sender or as a receiver—in the execution of a communication action. Moreover, there is no fixed synchronisation policy as these policies in general depend on the application. In this short paper, we reconsider the concept of safe communication in terms of reception and responsiveness requirements, originally defined for synchronisation policies determined by a synchronisation type. Illustrated by a motivating example, we propose three extensions. First, compliance, i.e. satisfaction of communication requirements, does not have to be immediate. Second, the synchronisation type (and hence the communication requirements) no longer has to be uniform, but can be specified per action. Third, we introduce final states to be able to distinguish between possible and guaranteed executions of actions.","ter Beek, Maurice H.; Hennicker, Rolf; Kleijn, Jetty",Coordination Models and Languages,733,1

Designing complex approximate circuits is, however, very difficult, especially, when a given approximation error has to be guaranteed. Evolutionary search algorithms together with SAT-based error evaluation currently represent one of the most successful approaches for automated circuit approximation. In this paper, we apply satisfiability solving not only for circuit evaluation but also for its minimisation. We consider and evaluate several approaches to this task, both inspired by existing works as well as novel ones. Our experiments show that a combined strategy, integrating evolutionary search and SMT-based sub-circuit minimisation (using quantified theory of arrays) that we propose, is able to find complex approximate circuits (e.g. 16-bit multipliers) with considerably better trade-offs between the circuit precision and size than existing approaches.","Češka, Milan; Matyáš, Jiří; Mrazek, Vojtech; Vojnar, Tomáš",Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing - SAT 2020,733,1

When an algorithm requires making subsequent runs of a SAT-solver on a slightly changing input formula, it is usually beneficial to change the strategy, so that the algorithm only operates on a single instance of a SAT-solver. One way to do this is via a mechanism called assumptions, which allows to accumulate and reuse knowledge from one iteration to the next and, in consequence, the provided input formula need not to be rebuilt during computation. In this paper we propose an encoding of a Pseudo-Boolean goal function that is based on sorting networks and can be provided to a SAT-solver only once. Then, during an optimization process, different bounds on the value of the function can be given to the solver by appropriate sets of assumptions. The experimental results show that the proposed technique is sound, that is, it increases the number of solved instances and reduces the average time and memory used by the solver on solved instances.","Karpiński, Michał; Piotrów, Marek",Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing - SAT 2020,733,13

While there has been a lot of progress in MaxSAT solvers during the last decade, the theoretical analysis of MaxSAT inference has not followed the pace. Aiming at compensating that lack of balance, in this paper we do a proof complexity approach to MaxSAT resolution-based proof systems. First, we give some basic definitions on completeness and show that refutational completeness makes compleness redundant, as it happens in SAT. Then we take three inference rules such that adding them sequentially allows us to navigate from the weakest to the strongest resolution-based MaxSAT system available (i.e., from standalone MaxSAT resolution to the recently proposed ResE), each rule making the system stronger. Finally, we show that the strongest system captures the recently proposed concept of Circular Proof while being conceptually simpler, since weights, which are intrinsic in MaxSAT, naturally guarantee the flow condition required for the SAT case.","Larrosa, Javier; Rollon, Emma",Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing - SAT 2020,733,13

The hashing-based techniques for approximate counting have emerged as a dominant approach, promising achievement of both scalability and rigorous theoretical guarantees. The standard construction of strongly 2-universal hash functions employs dense XORs (i.e., involving half of the variables in expectation), which is widely known to cause degradation in the runtime performance of state of the art [Formula: see text] solvers. Consequently, the past few years have witnessed an intense activity in the design of sparse XORs as hash functions. Such constructions have been proposed with beliefs to provide runtime performance improvement along with theoretical guarantees similar to that of dense XORs. The primary contribution of this paper is a rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis to understand the effect of the sparsity of XORs. In contradiction to prior beliefs of applicability of analysis for sparse hash functions to all the hashing-based techniques, we prove a contradictory result. We show that the best-known bounds obtained for sparse XORs are still too weak to yield theoretical guarantees for a large class of hashing-based techniques, including the state of the art approach [Formula: see text]. We then turn to a rigorous empirical analysis of the performance benefits of sparse hash functions. To this end, we first design, to the best of our knowledge, the most efficient algorithm called [Formula: see text] using sparse hash functions, which achieves at least up to two orders of magnitude performance improvement over its predecessor. Contradicting the current beliefs, we observe that [Formula: see text] still falls short of [Formula: see text] in runtime performance despite the usage of dense XORs in [Formula: see text]. In conclusion, our work showcases that the question of whether it is possible to use short XORs to achieve scalability while providing strong theoretical guarantees is still wide open.","Agrawal, Durgesh; Bhavishya; Meel, Kuldeep S.",Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing - SAT 2020,733,1

In defining these proof systems, we try to find a balance between the power of the proof system (the size of the proofs required to refute a formula) and the difficulty of finding the proofs. Among those proof systems we can mention Circular Resolution, MaxSAT Resolution with Extensions and MaxSAT Resolution with the Dual-Rail encoding. In this paper we study the relative power of those proof systems from a theoretical perspective. We prove that Circular Resolution and MaxSAT Resolution with extension are polynomially equivalent proof systems. This result is generalized to arbitrary sets of inference rules with proof constructions based on circular graphs or based on weighted clauses. We also prove that when we restrict the Split rule (that both systems use) to bounded size clauses, these two restricted systems are also equivalent.

Several encodings with propagation strength guarantees rely upon prior compilation of the constraints into DNNF (decomposable negation normal form), BDD (binary decision diagram), or some other sub-variants. However it has been shown that there exist PB-constraints whose ordered BDD (OBDD) representations, and thus the inferred CNF encodings, all have exponential size. Since DNNFs are more succinct than OBDDs, preferring encodings via DNNF to avoid size explosion seems a legitimate choice.

This Android application updates the locations of the areas in a Google map which are identified to be the containment zones. The application also notifies the users if they have entered a containment zone and uploads the user’s IMEI number to the online database. To achieve all these functionalities, many tools, and APIs from Google like Firebase and Geofencing API are used in this application.

The least square fitting method and the end-inspiratory occlusion method have been proposed as non-invasive alternatives for P(musc) assessment. The aims of this study were: (1) to compare the accuracy of P(musc) estimation using the end-inspiration occlusion (P(musc,index)) and the least square fitting (P(musc,lsf)) against the reference method based on P(es); (2) to test the accuracy of P(musc,lsf) and of P(musc,index) to detect overassistance, defined as P(musc) ≤ 1 cmH(2)O. We studied 18 patients at three different PSV levels. At each PSV level, P(musc), P(musc,lsf), P(musc,index) were calculated on the same breaths. Differences among P(musc), P(musc,lsf), P(musc,index) were analyzed with linear mixed effects models. Bias and agreement were assessed by Bland–Altman analysis for repeated measures. The ability of P(musc,lsf) and P(musc,index) to detect overassistance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Positive and negative predictive values were calculated using cutoff values that maximized the sum of sensitivity and specificity. At each PSV level, P(musc,lsf) was not different from P(musc) (p = 0.96), whereas P(musc,index) was significantly lower than P(musc). The bias between P(musc) and P(musc,lsf) was zero, whereas P(musc,index) systematically underestimated P(musc) of 6 cmH(2)O. The limits of agreement between P(musc) and P(musc,lsf) and between P(musc) and P(musc,index) were ± 12 cmH(2)O across bias.

The inspiratory effort during PSV could not be accurately estimated by the least square fitting or end-inspiratory occlusion method because the limits of agreement were far above the signal size.

Governments have taken public health protection measures to reduce the spread of the virus through non-pharmalogical measures. The impact of the pandemic and the public health response on individual and population mental health is unknown. Methods: We used Google Trends data (1 Jan 2020 - 30 Mar 2020) to investigate the impact of the pandemic and government measures to curb it on people’s concerns, as indexed by changes in search frequency for topics indicating mental distress, social and economic stressors and mental health treatment-seeking. We explored the changes of key topics in Google trends in Italy, Spain, USA, UK, and Worldwide in relation to sentinel events during the pandemic. Results: Globally there appears to be significant concerns over the financial and work-related consequences of the pandemic, with some evidence that levels of fear are rising. Conversely relative searching for topics related to depression and suicide fell after the pandemic was announced, with some evidence that searches for the latter have risen recently. Concerns over education and access to medication appear to be particular social stressors. Whilst searches for face-to-face treatments have declined, those for self-care have risen. Conclusions: Monitoring Google trends shows promise as a means of tracking changing public concerns. In weeks to come it may enable policy makers to assess the impact of their interventions including those aiming to limit negative consequences, such as government funded financial safety nets.","Knipe, Duleeka; Evans, Hannah; Marchant, Amanda; Gunnell, David; John, Ann",Wellcome Open Res,733,1

The first is a selective realist position, which is known as Explanationist Realism, according to which we should believe only in the indispensable parts of our best scientific theories. Those parts that are considered indispensable, the so-called “working posits” (Kitcher, The advancement of science: Science without legend, objectivity without illusions. Oxford University Press, New York, 1993), are the ones that are responsible for, or best explain, the predictive success of our best scientific theories (Psillos , Scientific realism: how science tracks truth. Routledge, London, 1999). The second is an antirealist position with a long history in philosophy of science (see, for example, Duhem, The aim and structure of physical theory. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ. Translated from the French by Philip P. Wiener, 1954/1982) , known as Instrumentalism, according to which scientific theories are mere instruments or tools of prediction (Rowbottom, The instrument of science: scientific anti-realism revitalised. Routledge, London, 2019). The third is an influential antirealist position, which is known as Constructive Empiricism and is due to Bas van Fraassen (The scientific image. Oxford University Press, New York, 1980), according to which science aims at empirical adequacy, not truth or approximate truth. The fourth is another influential realist position, which is known as Entity Realism and is due to Ian Hacking (Representing and intervening: introductory topics in the philosophy of natural science. Cambridge University Press, New York, 1983), according to which one is justified in taking a realist stance with respect to entities that can be manipulated and that facilitate interventions in nature (Sankey, Howard, Scientific realism and the rationality of science. Ashgate, Hampshire, 2008). The fifth is another selective realist position, which is known as Structural Realism, according to which we should be realists, not about theoretical entities or processes, but rather about structures (Worrall, Dialectica 43(1–2):99–124, 1989; Ladyman, Stud. Hist. Philos. Sci. A 29(3):409–424, 1998; French, The structure of the world: metaphysics and representation. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2014) .","Mizrahi, Moti",The Relativity of Theory,733,1

One of the main elements underlying this trust is the remote authentication of the user through its biometric features while of course protecting these features in different storage media. In this paper, we propose a new palmprint/palm-vein recognition framework based on a hand-craft image feature learning method is suggested. Furthermore, to increase the anti-spoof capability of the system, an effective biometric templates protection method based on chaotic systems was proposed.

There exists a variety of approaches for solving such problems, but for problems with complex constraints and objective functions, local search algorithms scale the best. Such algorithms usually assume that finding a non-optimal solution with no other requirements is easy. However, what if it is NP-hard? In such case, a SAT solver can be used for finding the initial solution, but how can one continue solving the optimization problem? We offer a generic methodology, called Local Search with SAT Oracle (LSSO), to solve such problems. LSSO facilitates implementation of advanced local search methods, such as variable neighbourhood search, hill climbing and iterated local search, while using a SAT solver as an oracle.

Whilst the problem is undecidable in general and hard in practice, we have been making large pragmatic steps forward. Our previous work proposed an instantiation rule for theory reasoning that produced pragmatically useful instances. Whilst this led to an increase in performance, it had its limitations as the rule produces ground instances which (i) can be overly specific, thus not useful in proof search, and (ii) contribute to the already problematic search space explosion as many new instances are introduced. This paper begins by introducing that specifically addresses these two concerns as it produces general solutions and it is a simplification rule, i.e. it replaces an existing clause by a ‘simpler’ one. Encouraged by initial success with this new rule, we performed an experiment to identify further common cases where the complex structure of theory terms blocked existing methods. This resulted in four further simplification rules for theory reasoning. The resulting extensions are implemented in the Vampire theorem prover and evaluated on SMT-LIB, showing that the new extensions result in a considerable increase in the number of problems solved, including 90 problems unsolved by state-of-the-art SMT solvers.","Reger, Giles; Schoisswohl, Johannes; Voronkov, Andrei",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,733,1

First, she recognizes the situation of nurses within healthcare organizations which affords them the opportunity to defend and promote caring as a central form of human practice. She points to some of the key challenges for nurses and nursing ethics from a care ethics perspective: how the larger issues of health care and cost containment affect the ethical possibilities of what nurses can accomplish; the tension between increasingly technical and technologically distant practices and the basic human needs of patients, such as the need to be touched and to be heard; the organizational and political tension between professionalism for nurses and the place of nurses as advocates for everyone else in care settings—especially their role in respecting difference and addressing disparities. Finally, she touches on some of the challenges which the COVID-19 pandemic presents and suggests that, even though it is a huge crisis in health care, it also presents nurses with the opportunity to reorient social values toward all forms of care.","Tronto, Joan C.",Nursing Ethics: Feminist Perspectives,733,13

The companies producing biosafety products have experienced an unforeseen change in the demand for products, due to the international protocols of health organizations on the use of these types of products to mitigate the spread of the virus. For companies involved in these supply chains, the priority is to maintain adequate service levels in the current scenario, guaranteeing high availability at each link in order to help preserve life. This requires maintaining the articulation and flexibility of the processes in the supply chain, reflected in decision making. Despite the relevance of the problem, studies on multi-product inventory business strategies and their impact on service level and volatile demand during a pandemic are limited. This article shows the experience of a Colombian biosafety products company, which, focused on fulfilling its mission, guaranteeing customer and user satisfaction, developed strategies that made its management model of inventories management more flexible. The contribution of this proposal leads to some important knowledge that may be of interest for the management of inventories in biosafety companies that manage multiple products of great demand, volatile behavior and of high importance, which impacts on the containment of the spread of the virus in a global disruption of supply chains.

Follicular regulatory T (Tfr) and follicular helper T (Tfh) cells were T cell subsets that play important roles in B cell maturation and antibody production. However, their significance in microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) patients, one type of AAV, has not been thoroughly studied. In this study, comprehensive pattern analyses of circulating Tfr and Tfh were performed in MPA patients and healthy controls (HCs), and we found Tfr levels and Tfr/Tfh ratios were significantly decreased in MPA patients. Compared with HCs, Helios+, CD45RA-FoxP3hi and Ki-67+ Tfr were lower in MPA patients, while CD226+ Tfr cells were higher. These phenotypes suggest that function and proliferation ability of Tfr cells were relatively impaired. Tfh subsets including ICOS+PD-1+ and Ki-67+ Tfh were significantly increased, suggesting that the function of Tfh was enhanced in MPA although the total Tfh levels did not change significantly. Circulating memory B cells and plasmablasts were significantly elevated and negatively correlated with Tfr levels and Tfr/Tfh ratios in MPA patients. In addition, Tfr levels and Tfr/Tfh ratios were negatively while Tfh was positively correlated with serum MPO-ANCA levels. Furthermore, Tfr and Tfr/Tfh ratio were also reversely associated with SCr, BUN, IL-4 and IL-21 levels. Our results suggest that the imbalance of Tfr and Tfh functional subsets is related to increased level of autoantibodies in MPA patients, and we propose a new mechanism for the pathogenesis of MPA.

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to catalog spillover-related health utilities to facilitate their consideration in CEAs. METHODS We systematically reviewed the medical and economic literatures (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EconLit, from inception through 3 April 2018) to identify articles that reported preference-based measures of spillover effects. We used keywords for utility measures combined with caregivers, family members, and burden. RESULTS Of 3695 articles identified, 80 remained after screening: 8 (10%) reported spillover utility per se, as utility or disutility (i.e. utility loss); 25 (30%) reported a comparison group, either population values (n = 9) or matched, non-caregiver/family member or unaffected individuals' utilities (n = 16; 3 reported both spillover and a comparison group); and 50 (63%) reported caregiver/family member utilities only. Alzheimer's disease/dementia was the most commonly studied disease/condition, and the EQ-5D was the most commonly used measurement instrument. CONCLUSIONS This comprehensive catalog of utilities showcases the spectrum of diseases and conditions for which caregiver and family members' spillover effects have been measured, and the variation in measurement methods used. In general, utilities indicated a loss in quality of life associated with being a caregiver or family member of an ill relative. Most studies reported caregiver/family member utility without any comparator, limiting the ability to infer spillover effects. Nevertheless, these values provide a starting point for considering spillover effects in the context of CEA, opening the door for more comprehensive analyses.","Wittenberg, Eve; James, Lyndon P; Prosser, Lisa A",PharmacoEconomics,733,9

Approaches to evidence synthesis such as carefully conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential tools to summarize specific topics. Unfortunately, not all systematic reviews are truly systematic, and their quality can vary substantially. Since well-conducted evidence synthesis typically involves a complex set of steps, we believe formulating a cohesive, step-by-step guide on how to conduct a systemic review and meta-analysis is essential. While most of the guidelines on systematic reviews focus on how to report or appraise systematic reviews, they lack guidance on how to synthesize evidence efficiently. To facilitate the design and development of evidence syntheses, we provide a clear and concise, 24-step guide on how to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and clinical trials. We describe each step, illustrate it with concrete examples, and provide relevant references for further guidance. The 24-step guide (1) simplifies the methodology of conducting a systematic review, (2) provides healthcare professionals and researchers with methodologically sound tools for conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and (3) it can enhance the quality of existing evidence synthesis efforts.

With the exception of the large nidoviruses, such as coronaviruses (CoVs), RNA viruses lack proofreading and thus are dependent on RdRps to control nucleotide selectivity and fidelity. CoVs encode a proofreading exonuclease in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN), which confers a greater-than-10-fold increase in fidelity compared to other RNA viruses. It is unknown to what extent the CoV polymerase (nsp12-RdRp) participates in replication fidelity. We sought to determine whether homology modeling could identify putative determinants of nucleotide selectivity and fidelity in CoV RdRps. We modeled the CoV murine hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp12-RdRp structure and superimposed it on solved picornaviral RdRp structures. Fidelity-altering mutations previously identified in coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) were mapped onto the nsp12-RdRp model structure and then engineered into the MHV genome with [nsp14-ExoN(+)] or without [nsp14-ExoN(-)] ExoN activity. Using this method, we identified two mutations conferring resistance to the mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): nsp12-M611F and nsp12-V553I. For nsp12-V553I, we also demonstrate resistance to the mutagen 5-azacytidine (5-AZC) and decreased accumulation of mutations. Resistance to 5-FU, and a decreased number of genomic mutations, was effectively masked by nsp14-ExoN proofreading activity. These results indicate that nsp12-RdRp likely functions in fidelity regulation and that, despite low sequence conservation, some determinants of RdRp nucleotide selectivity are conserved across RNA viruses. The results also indicate that, with regard to nucleotide selectivity, nsp14-ExoN is epistatic to nsp12-RdRp, consistent with its proposed role in a multiprotein replicase-proofreading complex. IMPORTANCE RNA viruses have evolutionarily fine-tuned replication fidelity to balance requirements for genetic stability and diversity. Responsibility for replication fidelity in RNA viruses has been attributed to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, with mutations in RdRps for multiple RNA viruses shown to alter fidelity and attenuate virus replication and virulence. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are the only known RNA viruses to encode a proofreading exonuclease (nsp14-ExoN), as well as other replicase proteins involved in regulation of fidelity. This report shows that the CoV RdRp (nsp12) likely functions in replication fidelity; that residue determinants of CoV RdRp nucleotide selectivity map to similar structural regions of other, unrelated RNA viral polymerases; and that for CoVs, the proofreading activity of the nsp14-ExoN is epistatic to the function of the RdRp in fidelity.","Sexton, Nicole R; Smith, Everett Clinton; Blanc, Hervé; Vignuzzi, Marco; Peersen, Olve B; Denison, Mark R",Journal of virology,733,19

To avoid variations in surgical proficiency, only 242 patients managed by two surgeons who each performed >80 RM procedures during the study period were included in this study. All cases of RM were performed with a reduced port technique. We obtained the following data from each patient's medical chart: age, gravidity, parity, body mass index, and history of previous abdominal surgery including cesarean section. We also collected information on the maximal diameter and type of myomas, number and weight of removed myomas, concomitant surgery, total OT from skin incision to closure, estimated blood loss (EBL), and blood transfusion. Data on preoperative use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHas) and perioperative use of hemostatic agents (tranexamic acid or vasopressin) were also collected. Data on the length of hospital stay, postoperative fever within 48 h, and any complications related to RM were also obtained. The primary endpoint in this study was the identification of factors affecting EBL and the secondary endpoint was the identification of factors affecting the total OT during multiport RM. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the factors affecting EBL and OT during multiport RM. The medians of the maximal diameter and weight of the removed myomas were 9.00 (interquartile range [IQR], 7.00 to 10.00) cm and 249.75 (IQR, 142.88 to 401.00) g, respectively. The median number of myomas was two (IQR, one to four), ranging from 1 to 34. Of the cases, 155 had low EBL and 87 had high EBL. Most myomas were of the intramural type (n = 179). The odds of EBL > 320 mL increased by 251% (odds ratio [OR], 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-5.42) for five to nine myomas and by 647% (OR, 6.47; 95% CI, 1.87-22.33) for ≥10 myomas. The odds of subserosal-type myomas decreased by 67% compared with intramural-type myomas (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.14-0.80). History of abdominal surgery other than cesarean section was positively correlated with EBL. The weight of the removed myomas and a history of previous cesarean section were not correlated with the EBL. Conclusion: The number of myomas (5-9 and ≥10), maximal myoma diameter, and history of abdominal surgery other than cesarean section affect the EBL in RM.","Lee, Sa Ra; Kim, Ju Hee; Kim, Sehee; Kim, Sung Hoon; Chae, Hee Dong",Journal of clinical medicine,733,32

We recently proposed the novel Nakayama-Higashiyama imprint cytological classification (N-H classification) based on small-sized lung adenocarcinoma surgical specimens, which correlated with histological patterns and nodal involvement. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between STAS and the N-H classification and to validate the N-H classification as an intraoperative predictor of the presence of STAS. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 164 intraoperative imprint cytologies and their paired histologic specimens from patients undergoing surgical resection for lung adenocarcinoma in our institute in 2017-2019. Using the NH classification, imprint cytological findings were classified into 5 groups (Groups I to V) based on cell cluster shape, cell and nucleus size, and the existence of necrosis. We examined the characteristics of imprint cytology and STAS in the resected tissues and analyzed the relationship between them. RESULTS Tumor STAS was observed in 29 (17.7 %) cases. The presence of STAS was significantly associated with the NH classification (P < 0.0001). STAS was present in 6 of 57 cases (10.5 %) in NH classification Group II, 11 of 42 cases (26.2 %) in Group III, and 12 of 28 cases (42.9 %) in Group IV/V; STAS was not observed in any case in Group I. Logistic regression analysis revealed that tumors with a ground glass opacity rate of <50 % on computed tomography (P = 0.00867) and Groups III-V of the NH classification (P = 0.00201) were significant independent predictors for STAS. CONCLUSION Intraoperative imprint cytology with the N-H classification for lung adenocarcinoma is well correlated with the STAS status of the tumor and might have applications as an intraoperative predictive marker of STAS. This classification may be useful for intraoperative detection of STAS and in the decision-making process for the surgical procedure.","Kimura, Toru; Nakamura, Harumi; Omura, Akiisa; Ike, Akihiro; Hiroshima, Takashi; Maniwa, Tomohiro; Honma, Keiichiro; Higashiyama, Masahiko; Okami, Jiro",Lung cancer,733,1

We also analyzed the performance of potential refuge islands during early phases the COVID-19 pandemic.

We addressed this issue through the first structurome-scale computational investigation, in which we estimated the change in folding free energy upon all possible single-site mutations introduced in more than 20,000 protein structures, as well as through available experimental stability and fitness data. RESULTS At the amino acid level, we found the protein surface to be more robust against random mutations than the core, this difference being stronger for small proteins. The destabilizing and neutral mutations are more numerous in the core and on the surface, respectively, whereas the stabilizing mutations are about 4% in both regions. At the genetic code level, we observed smallest destabilization for mutations that are due to substitutions of base III in the codon, followed by base I, bases I+III, base II, and other multiple base substitutions. This ranking highly anticorrelates with the codon-anticodon mispairing frequency in the translation process. This suggests that the standard genetic code is optimized to limit the impact of random mutations, but even more so to limit translation errors. At the codon level, both the codon usage and the usage bias appear to optimize mutational robustness and translation accuracy, especially for surface residues. CONCLUSION Our results highlight the non-universality of mutational robustness and its multiscale dependence on protein features, the structure of the genetic code, and the codon usage. Our analyses and approach are strongly supported by available experimental mutagenesis data.","Schwersensky, Martin; Rooman, Marianne; Pucci, Fabrizio",BMC biology,733,1

Our objective was to compare mechanical ventilator weaning duration for critically ill adults and children when managed with automated systems versus non-automated strategies. Secondary objectives were to determine differences in duration of ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay (LOS), mortality, and adverse events. METHODS Electronic databases were searched to 30 September 2013 without language restrictions. We also searched conference proceedings; trial registration websites; and article reference lists. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined data using random-effects modelling. RESULTS We identified 21 eligible trials totalling 1,676 participants. Pooled data from 16 trials indicated that automated systems reduced the geometric mean weaning duration by 30% (95% confidence interval (CI) 13% to 45%), with substantial heterogeneity (I(2) = 87%, P <0.00001). Reduced weaning duration was found with mixed or medical ICU populations (42%, 95% CI 10% to 63%) and Smartcare/PS (28%, 95% CI 7% to 49%) but not with surgical populations or using other systems. Automated systems reduced ventilation duration with no heterogeneity (10%, 95% CI 3% to 16%) and ICU LOS (8%, 95% CI 0% to 15%). There was no strong evidence of effect on mortality, hospital LOS, reintubation, self-extubation and non-invasive ventilation following extubation. Automated systems reduced prolonged mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. Overall quality of evidence was high.

The infection by RNA virus, also known as SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV, from beta class of corona viruses has been found to be responsible for COVID-19. Structural analysis and evidences have been indicated that interaction between a segment of receptor binding domain (RBD) from S protein of virus and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is essential for cellular entry of virus. OBJECTIVE The current review put the light on structural aspects for inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction mediated cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS The present study provides a critical review of recently published information on RBD-hACE2 interaction and its inhibitors to control SARS-CoV-2 infection. The review highlighted the structural aspects of interaction between RBDhACE2 and involved amino acid residues. RESULTS Recently, several studies are being conducted for inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry to the human cellular system. One of the important targets for viral invasion is its binding with cell surface receptor, hACE2, through RBD on S-protein. Mimicking of three residues on ACE2 (Lys31, Glu35 and Lys353 on B chain) provided hot target directed strategy for inhibition of early attachment of virus to the cell. Early screening of peptidic or non-peptidic molecules for inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction has been raised the hope for potential therapeutics against COVID-19. The higher affinity of molecules toward RBD than ACE2 is important factor for selectivity and minimization of ACE2 related adverse events on cardiovascular system, brain, kidney, and foetus development during pregnancy. CONCLUSION Inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction by different molecular scaffolds can be used as a preferred strategy for control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, published reports pointed out Lys31, Glu35 and Lys353 on B chain of ACE2 as crucial residues for mimicking and design of novel molecules as inhibitors SARS-CoV-2 attachment to human cells. Moreover, some recently identified RBD-hACE2 interaction inhibitors have also been described with their protein binding pattern and potencies (IC50 values) which will help for further improvement in the selectivity.","Nayak, Surendra Kumar",Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,733,5

Thus, the implementation of 3D virtual learning tools has become an indispensable, standard methodological tool in higher education. More recently, the enforcement of restrictions and emergency lockdowns to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic compelled higher education institutions worldwide to cope with and meet the requirements of online education while preserving the quality of the learning experience at an equal pace. To develop a 3D physics laboratory, the appropriate equipment for physical experiments was first collected;then, the design software was applied to construct the 3D model. Software was then developed to edit the 3D experimental environment. Two practical tests were performed on the completed setup to verify the disadvantages and feasibility of the experiments. The present study develops and validates the incorporation of user satisfaction approaches to examine the quality of the most influential 3D learning tools during the coronavirus outbreak. The findings of this study confirm that 3D laboratories can positively influence learning attitudes when it comes to physics and improve learners’ understanding of physics concepts;they also confirm that 3D laboratories are a suitable tool for teaching physics experiments. Finally, the difficulties and solutions encountered in the development of the 3D laboratory are outlined as a reference for subsequent studies.","Shyr, Wen-Jye Liau Hung-Ming Hsu Chia-Chen Chen Chia-Hung",Sustainability,733,8

Anaphylactic reactions are a widespread concern driving vaccine hesitancy due to the serious and potentially fatal nature of anaphylaxis. A quantitative estimation of the risk of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions deriving from mRNA vaccines is of a significant public health importance. Objective: To estimate the relative Reporting Odds Ratio of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions following mRNA vaccination vis-a-vis other vaccinations. Design: Reporting case-control study. Setting: Persons reporting adverse events following vaccination to VAERS whose reports were received between 01 January 2000 and 02 July 2021, inclusive. Patients: Each case of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reaction was matched with 2.7 unique controls on average, by gender and age rounded to the nearest integer. Measurements: Overall and stratified Reporting Odds Ratios (ROR) were calculated. Stratified contingency tables were tested for homogeneity using the Breslow-Day procedure, and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistics were calculated to test the hypothesis of a ROR of unity. Results: 2,665 cases of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions and 7,125 controls of non-anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reports were compared. The ROR of an anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction was 1.325 (95% CI: 1.212 - 1.448, p < 0.001). The matched set of cases and controls did not reveal inhomogeneity by gender or age band strata, suggesting that these factors have no impact on the likelihood to report an anaphylactic event as opposed to a non-anaphylactic event following mRNA vaccination. A slightly elevated ROR was observed with patients who reported a history of allergic reactions to NSAIDs and/or fluoroquinolone antibiotics. The precise meaning and relevance of this finding remains to be elucidated. Previous reactions to vaccines do not appear to correlate statistically significantly with a higher risk of reporting an anaphylactic adverse effect after mRNA vaccination. Limitations: As a reporting study using data from VAERS, our analysis is subject to under- and overreporting, the extent of each of which is not known with any degree of precision. Since the Emergency Use Authorizations for both mRNA vaccines mandate reporting of all serious adverse events, reporting bias is likely in favour of non- mRNA vaccines, where such reporting is not mandatory in adults. Consequently, this analysis may exaggerate the ROR of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid events associated with mRNA vaccines, which may in reality be significantly lower. Conclusions: mRNA vaccination is not associated with a statistically significant higher risk of reporting an anaphylactic adverse event to VAERS. Anaphylaxis is a serious but very rare complication of all immunisations. No significant increase in reporting odds was found in any age group or gender, nor in most cases of previously known allergic adverse events in relation to vaccines. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence proving the safety and tolerability of mRNA vaccines.","von Csefalvay, C.",,733,16

Demographic inference based on coalescent theory has been used to reconstruct the population dynamics and evolutionary history of several species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), an important human pathogen causing tuberculosis. One key assumption of the Kingman coalescent is that the number of descendants of different individuals does not vary strongly, and violating this assumption could lead to severe biases caused by model misspecification. Individual lineages of MTB are expected to vary strongly in reproductive success because 1) MTB is potentially under constant selection due to the pressure of the host immune system and of antibiotic treatment, 2) MTB undergoes repeated population bottlenecks when it transmits from one host to the next, and 3) some hosts show much higher transmission rates compared to the average (“super-spreaders”). Here we used an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach to test whether multiple merger coalescents (MMC), a class of models that allow for large variation in reproductive success among lineages, are more appropriate models to study MTB populations. We considered eleven publicly available whole genome sequence data sets sampled from local MTB populations and outbreaks, and found that MMC had a better fit compared to the Kingman coalescent for ten of the eleven data sets. These results indicate that the null model for analyzing MTB outbreaks should be reassessed, and that past findings based on the Kingman coalescent need to be revisited.","Menardo, F.; Gagneux, S.; Freund, F.",bioRxiv,733,27

There are reports that COVID-19 drives adoption of robot technologies, and that health institutions are more positive to the use of robots due to the lower risk of virus spread, among other reasons. The media have contributed significantly to an increased interest in caring robots and from a societal perspective - given recent lockdowns, social distancing, etc. - an increase of robot usage in health care settings is not difficult to imagine. Older adults have in many countries been isolated, either at home or in care homes. This group, and especially individuals with dementia, were already vulnerable before the pandemic, living with an increased risk for loneliness and depression. For the last 10 years in Sweden, many actions have been taken to improve these people's well-being and quality of life, including the use of social companion robots as psychological interventions. Given the increased isolation due to the pandemic, we wanted to investigate how the use of social companion robots has been affected in care homes during this time. We, therefore, interviewed nine health care staff members from seven different care homes for older adults in Sweden.

The aim of this study is to determine the predictors of BSE in breastfeeding mothers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with 300 breastfeeding mothers who breastfed during the Covid-19 pandemic. Convenience sampling was used to recruit participants. A battery of online questionnaires measured sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics, breastfeeding self-efficacy, spouse postpartum social support, perceived social support, anxiety and depression, and fear of Covid-19. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficients, one-way ANOVA, and multivariable linear regression via stepwise method. The significance level in this study was α = 0.05. Results The mean BSE score among participants was 58.19 ± 10.48 (out of 70). Spouse postpartum social support (β = 0.732, p = 0.04), intention to breastfeed (β = 0.17, p = 0.001), use of formula while breastfeeding (β = −0.09, p < 0.001), and depression (β = - 0.11, p < 0.001) were significant predictors of BSE. However, fear of Covid-19 was not significantly correlated with BSE (p = 0.514). Conclusion The results of the present study showed that fear of Covid-19 was not a significant predictor of BSE, while spouse postpartum social support and having the intention of breastfeeding were positively associated with BSE. Depression and simultaneous use of formula in feeding the infant was negatively associated with BSE during Covid-19. Overall, breastfeeding can be encouraged through counseling to improve receiving spousal support, increasing breastfeeding intent, and reducing depression.","Zadeh Beheshti, Maryam Ahmad Alimoradi Zainab Bahrami Nasim Allen Kelly-Ann Lissack Kerrie",Journal of Neonatal Nursing,733,1

Population health management based on an accurate patient record provides an efficient, cost-effective alternative. Methods: To improve the accuracy of the HCM patient list in a single hospital, we developed a rule-based information extraction natural language processing (NLP) framework. The framework employed ontological expansion of vocabulary and exclusion-first annotation, and received training by an 'expert in the loop'. The output stratified patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF), those without active cardiology care and likely screened individuals. Results: The algorithm was validated against multiple data sources, including manual validation, for HCM, AF and HF and family history of the disease. Overall precision and recall were 0.854 and 0.865 respectively. The pipeline found 25,356 documents featuring HCM-related terms belonging to 11,083 patients. Excluding scanned documents resulted in 17,178 letters from 3,120 patients. Subsequent categorisation identified 1,753 real cases, of whom 357 had AF and 205 had HF. There were 696 likely screened individuals. Adjusting for 304 false-negative patients, the total HCM cohort was 2,045 patients. 214 were not under a cardiologist. NLP uncovered 709 patients who were absent in the registry or hospital disease codes. Conclusion: This novel NLP framework generated a hospital-wide record of patients with HCM and defined various cohorts, including the small set of HCM patients lacking current cardiology input. Existing data sources inadequately described this population, spotlighting NLP's essential role for clinical teams planning to move to a population health management model of care.

Detailed and objective clinical and radiological characterization of patients at-risk of sporting and non-sporting repetitive concussive and subconcussive traumatic brain injury (RC/SCI) is important to our understanding of traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES) and CTE. This paper presents the initial findings of the symptomatology, neurocognitive, and pathophysiological changes in CTE (SNAP-CTE) study. A preliminary, retrospective, cohort study of 28 patients (25 males and 3 females) presenting with complaints of mood, behavioral, and cognitive decline, comprising TES, aged 24 to 78 years (M = 53, SD = 15.3) with at least 10 years of exposure to RC/SCI (mostly through contact sport) and cognitive decline were examined including: demographics; duration of play; age of first exposure to RC/SCI; and neuropsychology. Participants performed significantly worse in tests of auditory, visual, immediate, and delayed memory compared to a normative sample. Those with absent insight, compared to those with preserved insight, had a larger discrepancy between predicted and actual auditory memory scores, and had more severe mood disturbances. Insight, a hallmark sign of dementia, was either absent or impaired in a significant proportion (M = 36.4%, 95% CI =17.2% - 59.3%) of the sample aged under 65, compared with normative epidemiological data. This indicates that RC/SCI may be associated with risk of an early onset dementia syndrome representing probably TES/CTE. CTE is increasingly of concern to the Australian community, and further research in this area is necessary. This retrospective preliminary study will form the basis of large, prospective, longitudinal cohort studies, assessing the natural history of TES/CTE in Australian athletes.","Mobbs, R.; Batchelor, J.; Teunisse, A.; Erskine, E.; Brown, E.; Hood, J.; Mobbs, A.; Fraser, C.; Pearce, A.

This conversation is deeply insurrectional for it invites the whole world, centres and margins alike, to confront how political, cultural, economic and social values and structures of knowledge production are implicated in the making and unmaking of the authentic, of truth as well as of the fake.","Ogola, George",Journal of African Cultural Studies,733,1

This study is an effort to recognize the factors which influence the choice of a future specialty of young Pakistani doctors in order to help identify the areas which need improvement. Study design This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from 12th May 2021 to 2nd August 2021. Young doctors who had completed their one-year internship in hospitals of Punjab were invited to fill the questionnaire via social media platforms. Data were entered and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23.0. Chi-square tests were applied for qualitative variables. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results Out of 105 participants 60 (57.1%) were females. More females as compared to males decided the future specialty based on work-life balance (20/27 p= 0.039). Internal medicine and general surgery were the most sought-after fields both before and after the internship. Forty-three (41%) participants wished to change their choice of specialty after their house job experiences. Fifty-eight (55.2%) participants considered the future prospects of the field while deciding their specialty while sixty-three (60%) reported the attitude of the senior doctors as an important deciding factor. The Covid-19 pandemic had an effect on 12 (11.4%) participants' decision regarding their choice of future specialty. Conclusion Many elements such as internship play a pivotal role in helping young doctors to narrow their choices. It is important to understand the factors considered by young doctors during their choice of a medical specialty to ensure that a significant proportion of the medical workforce does not slip through the cracks in our health infrastructure.,"Tameez-ud-din, A.; Malik, I.

On December 11, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to prevent COVID-19, administered as 2 doses separated by 21 days (1) On December 27, 2020, Italy started use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and initial doses were reserved for health care personnel Objectives: The primary end points were the safety of each administered dose in patients with Rheumatic diseases (RD's) Methods: In this multicenter, observational study, we interviewed by phone 27 patients with rheumatic diseases (RDs) and 30 healthy subjects receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (0.3 ml i.m. in two doses 21 days apart, time 0 and 3 weeks). Results: As of 30 January 2021, 57 subjects (27 patients and 30 healthy subjects) were interviewed. The epidemiological and clinical features of the 27 patients are reported in Table 1. Among the whole population, 35 subjects (16 patients and 19 healthy subjects) complained of an adverse event after the first vaccine dose, with symptom onset occurring within 1 day of vaccination. All adverse events (100%) were classified as nonserious and included: injection site pain (17), fatigue (5), headache (16), fever (3), tachycardia (2), and paresthesia (2). After 21 days, 6 patients and 11 healthy subjects received the second vaccine dose. Fifteen (5 patients and 10 healthy subjects) of them (88%) reported adverse events, again categorized as nonserious. Specifically, injection site pain (7), fatigue (10), headache (10), fever (10), paresthesia (1), cutaneous vasculitis (1), itchy and scratchy throat (1), diarrhea (4), lymph node enlargement (1) were recorded. No differences were noted between patients with RDs and healthy subjects in terms of adverse events. Conclusion: This preliminary study shows that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is as safe in patients with RDs as in healthy subjects. Whether patients with RDs will develop protective titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as compared to healthy subjects will be evaluated in further, ongoing studies.","Cuomo, G.; Atteno, M.; Naclerio, C.; Adinolfi, L.

Usually, the alignment is performed with the Smith-Waterman (SW) algorithm, a well-known sequence alignment technique of high-level precision based on dynamic programming. However, given the massive data volume in biological databases and their continuous exponential increase, high-speed data processing is necessary. Therefore, this work proposes a parallel hardware design for the SW algorithm with a systolic array structure to accelerate the Forward and Backtracking steps. For this purpose, the architecture calculates and stores the paths in the Forward stage for pre-organizing the alignment, which reduces the complexity of the Backtracking stage. The backtracking starts from the maximum score position in the matrix and generates the optimal SW sequence alignment path. The architecture was validated on Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), and synthesis analyses have shown that the proposed design reaches up to 79.5 Giga Cell Updates per Second (GCPUS).","de Oliveira, Fabio F.; Dias, Leonardo A.; Fernandes, Marcelo A.

For these fundamental reasons, several unprecedented strategies, blueprints, and collaborations are to be explored in the long term. Apparently, one of the key objectives was to exploit natural gas as the primary and eco-friendly energy resource. This profitable gas was projected to significantly contribute a minimum of 22% of total energy toward enhancing economic growth. Approximately, 10 million city gas connections are required by 2025, in order to achieve the set goals. However, a gap exists between the initially planned city gas connections to the distribution network, and the realization during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. This global phenomenon poses a challenge to virtually all economic segments, including energy, as the demand plummeted drastically. Based on Indonesia’s National Energy Policy, the first proposed target was to develop 266,070 gas connections. The project was subsequently adjusted to 127,864. Surprisingly, the realization surpassed the new arrangement by over 6% or was about 135,286. However, the figures obviously comprehended 50.84% of the projects were stalled, contrary to the vision of constructing a minimum of 10 million city gas pipe connections in 2025. This study provided a profound description of the impact of the reduction in abovementioned development on the expected outcome, using the multivariable regression method. The results revealed 96.92% of data from the applied variables were able to describe the developed linear model.","Prima, A.; Ridaliani, O.; Hamid, A.; Pramadika, H.; Sanusi, H.

Design: Prospective observational cohort study. Setting: 6 primary and 5 secondary care sites across South East England, September 2013 to November 2015. Participants: 1280 participants, 65 years old or over, who were due for discharge from general medicine and older persons wards following an acute episode of care. Exclusion criteria were limited life expectancy, transfer to another hospital and consent not gained. Main outcome measures: Medication-related harm requiring healthcare utilisation, including adverse drug reactions, non-adherence and medication error determined via triangulation of: patient/carer reports gathered through a structured telephone interview; primary care medical record review; and prospective consultant-led review of re-admission to recruiting hospital. Frailty was measured using a Frailty Index, developed using a standardised approach. Marginal estimates were obtained from logistic regression models to examine how probabilities of healthcare service use due to medication-related harm were associated with increasing polypharmacy and frailty. Results: Healthcare utilisation due to medication-related harm was significantly associated with frailty (OR = 10.06, 95% CI 2.06 to 49.26, p = 0.004), independent of age, gender, and polypharmacy. With increasing polypharmacy, the need for healthcare use as a result of MRH increases from a probability of around 0.2 to 0.4. This is also the case for frailty. Conclusions: Frailty is as important as polypharmacy in its association with MRH. Reducing the burden of frailty through an integrated health and social care approach, alongside strategies to reduce inappropriate polypharmacy, may reduce MRH related healthcare utilisation.

The wide variance of state laws related to advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) acted as a barrier to mobility during this time. The Consensus Model for APRN Regulation, Licensure, Accreditation, Certification, and Education (Consensus Model) was developed in 2008 to provide a uniform model for APRN regulation. If adopted, the Consensus Model would align state laws related to APRNs and would clear the way for an APRN Compact, which would allow APRNs to practice across state borders. Although some states have completely adopted the Consensus Model's elements in the 13 years since its publication, many have not. Without regulatory uniformity, APRNs cannot efficiently provide care where needed throughout the country or practice to the full extent of their education, leaving some without access to quality care. This update provides a review of the elements of the Consensus Model, identifies progress made toward its full adoption, discusses continued barriers to full alignment with the Consensus Model, and describes the proposed APRN Compact that would result from further adoption of the model.","Buck, Michelle",Journal of Nursing Regulation,733,16

At the same time, vaccination passports could be a false hope: The requirement of vaccine passports could adversely embed social and economic inequalities that reflect the power dynamics in international relations. Specifically, the ability to secure vaccines relates to the varying market and economic power across countries. This paper focuses on Taiwan as a case study to explore ways in which the use of COVID-19 certifications, if used as a precondition for international travel, would further exacerbate a binary of exclusion and inclusion as a function of geopolitics. With its relative success in containing the COVID-19 pandemic within its borders, Taiwan represents a low priority for vaccine distribution in the COVAX initiative. Furthermore, due to Taiwan's contentious political status and its exclusion from the World Health Organization regime, if vaccination passports are required as a precondition for international travel, then outbound passengers from Taiwan potentially could be subjected to restriction of movement absent wide availability of vaccines domestically. This paper argues that insofar as sustainable pandemic control requires a global concerted effort, vaccination passports could further polarise a global response. This paper suggests that equitable access to effective vaccines worldwide and governance reform of global health would help to rebuild global solidarity and mitigate the unimaginable human, social and economic suffering arising from the pandemic. © 2021 The Author(s).

The quantitative assessment was based on wearable magneto-inertial measurement units (MIMUs). Eight male semi-professional football players participated in the study, which was characterized by a football-specific fatiguing protocol in an uncontrolled environment and a test on vertical jump (i.e., Bosco test). Six kinematic parameters were selected as suitable indicators for ballistic skill assessment (i.e., maximum height, mean exerted power, relative strength index, leg stiffness, contact time and flight time). The temporal analysis of their variations allowed to monitor the athletes' recovery. A significant effect of fatigue on measured variables was confirmed during the four weeks for three parameters in the Bosco test. Friedman's test confirmed significant differences across the four weeks for the aforementioned parameters (p < 0.05). From the Cliff's delta effect size, it can be confirmed that after four weeks the fatigue protocol effects were no longer detectable by our instrumental parameters, suggesting a full recovery of athletes' ballistic ability after the COVID-19 forced rest period. Indeed, the mean estimated effect size were 0.73 in the first week, 0.98 in the second one, 0.58 in third and 0.17 in the last one.

Objectives: The aim of the study was to study the frequency and structure of CI in the inpatient population of SpA patients in the course of a one-moment retrospective study. Methods: The study included 208 patients with SpA (121 men, 87 women, mean age 39.1±12.2 years) who were hospitalized at the V.A. Nasonova Research Institute of Rheumatology. Ankylosing spondylitis was diagnosed in 133 patients, psoriatic arthritis -in 57, spondyloarthritis associated with Crohn's disease -in 1, undifferentiated spondyloarthritis -in 17. The majority of respondents had higher education (60.6%). None of the patients consumed alcohol on a daily basis, 124 patients never smoked. The Charlson comorbidity index, equal to 0, had 98 respondents, 1 -51, 2 -27, 3 -15, 4 -10, 5 or more -7. Most patients (n=168) received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as well as glucocorticoids-GC (average duration of administration 239.5±65.8 months), methotrexate-MT (32.4±46.2), sulfasalazine (21.0±32.1), leflunomide (24.0±46.6), biological drugs -TNF-α inhibitors (21.5±23.3), inhibitors of interleukin (iIL)-12/23 (9.0±5.2), iIL-17 (11.0±9.3). Patients were interviewed by a research doctor with the completion of a unified questionnaire, additional data were obtained from medical documentation. Results: Leading in the structure of CI in patients with SpA were respiratory tract infections: acute nasopharyngitis (n=168), tonsillitis (74), acute bronchitis (34), sinusitis (33), pneumonia (29, including 9 cases by the virus SARSCoV-2), influenza (31), tuberculosis-TB (5, including 2 cases on infliximab therapy, which was the reason for withdrawal of the drug). Infectious diseases of other localization include herpes-viral infections (n=109), mycoses (51), urinary tract infections (47), conjunctivitis and blepharitis (37), otitis (25), genital infections (15), skin infections (14), intestinal infections (13), COVID-19 without lung damage (19), nervous system infections (2), bone infections (2), chronic hepatitis B (1), chronic hepatitis C (1), HIV infection (1), rubella in adulthood (1), measles in adulthood (1). 20.2% of patients reported more frequent development of CI after the onset of the of SpA: 35 of them received immunosuppressive therapy, 7 -monotherapy of NSAIDs. In SpA patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs, there was an increase in the frequency of acute nasopharyngitis (more often 3 times a year), sinusitis, acute bronchitis, pneumonia and herpes-viral infections, in particular herpes zoster. 29.8% of patients reported a more severe course of CI against the background of SpA (12 of them did not receive immunosuppressive drugs). Temporary discontinuation of therapy due to the development of CI occurred in 26.4% of patients. At the same time, in 5 patients treated with GC (including in combination with MT, n=3), the development of furunculosis was the reason for changing the treatment regimen. In one patient, MT therapy was discontinued due to the frequent development of purulent tonsillitis. Exacerbation of SpA after CI was diagnosed in 84 patients (70 of them received immunosuppressive therapy). Conclusion: The data obtained indicate the important of the problem of CI in SpA. Further studies are needed on large samples of patients in order to find significant risk factors for CI, study their relationship with clinical characteristics and influence on the course of SpA.","Baranova, M.; Muravyeva, N.; Belov, B.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,733,20
169066,169066,169066,Conceal Face Mask Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks,12.69832,1.1536481,2021,"Forecasting the risk of pathogen spillover from reservoir populations of wild or domestic animals is essential for the effective deployment of interventions such as wildlife vaccination or culling. Due to the sporadic nature of spillover events and limited availability of data, developing and validating robust, spatially explicit, predictions is challenging. Recent efforts have begun to make progress in this direction by capitalizing on machine learning methodologies. An important weakness of existing approaches, however, is that they generally rely on combining human and reservoir infection data during the training process and thus conflate risk attributable to the prevalence of the pathogen in the reservoir population with the risk attributed to the realized rate of spillover into the human population. Because effective planning of interventions requires that these components of risk be disentangled, we developed a multi-layer machine learning framework that separates these processes. Our approach begins by training models to predict the geographic range of the primary reservoir and the subset of this range in which the pathogen occurs. The spillover risk predicted by the product of these reservoir specific models is then fit to data on realized patterns of historical spillover into the human population. The result is a geographically specific spillover risk forecast that can be easily decomposed and used to guide effective intervention. Applying our method to Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that regularly spills over into the human population across West Africa, results in a model that explains a modest but statistically significant portion of geographic variation in historical patterns of spillover. When combined with a mechanistic mathematical model of infection dynamics, our spillover risk model predicts that 897,700 humans are infected by Lassa virus each year across West Africa, with Nigeria accounting for more than half of these human infections. Author Summary The 2019 emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is a grim reminder of the threat animal-borne pathogens pose to human health. Even prior to SARS-CoV-2, the spillover of pathogens from animal reservoirs was a persistent problem, with pathogens such as Ebola, Nipah, and Lassa regularly but unpredictably causing outbreaks. Machine-learning models that anticipate when and where pathogen transmission from animals to humans is likely to occur would help guide surveillance efforts and preemptive countermeasures like information campaigns or vaccination programs. We develop a novel machine learning framework that uses datasets describing the distribution of a virus within its host and the range of its animal host, along with data on spatial patterns of human immunity, to infer rates of animal-to-human transmission across a region. By training the model on data from the animal host alone, our framework allows rigorous validation of spillover predictions using human data. We apply our framework to Lassa fever, a viral disease of West Africa that is spread to humans by rodents, and use the predictions to update estimates of Lassa virus infections in humans. Our results suggest that Nigeria is most at risk for the emergence of Lassa virus, and should be prioritized for outbreak-surveillance.","Basinski, Andrew J.; Fichet-Calvet, Elisabeth; Sjodin, Anna R.; Varrelman, Tanner J.; Remien, Christopher H.; Layman, Nathan C.; Bird, Brian H.; Wolking, David J.; Monagin, Corina; Ghersi, Bruno M.; Barry, Peter A.; Jarvis, Michael A.; Gessler, Paul E.; Nuismer, Scott L.",bioRxiv,733,26

To facilitate new discoveries and gain better understanding of the genetics of psychiatric problems, large well-phenotyped biobank samples are greatly needed. The Estonian Biobank (EstBB;N=200,000) is a data-rich national biobank that joins genomic, biomarker, electronic health record (EHR), national registry and questionnaire data to significantly advance the current knowledge of the genetic underpinnings of complex and rare diseases. We aimed to expand the EstBB database with rich phenotypic questionnaire-based information on a broad set of symptoms of common psychiatric disorders and related phenotypes. Methods: Methods: We compiled an online questionnaire “Wellbeing and mental health” which included self-report brief screening instruments to capture a broad range of symptoms on current and/or lifetime depression, anxiety disorders, mania, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, psychotic experiences, suicidal thoughts and behavior, cognition, substance (ab)use, problematic gambling and related risk- and protective factors, such as childhood adversity, stressful life events, social support, lifestyle, sociodemographic factors and life satisfaction. In addition, the participants were asked about the side effects, discontinuation and switching of medications prescribed for a mental health problem in their lifetime. Since the start of the data collection coincided with the peak of the second COVID-19 wave in Estonia, we included items related to current perceived stress, burnout and change in mental health during the pandemic. When selecting instruments, preference was given based on 1) reliability and validity of the instruments;2) whether an Estonian adaptation and/or validation has been conducted;3) application in other large biobanks (e.g. the UK Biobank) for future harmonization or replication;4) short length. Results: Results: The invitations to participate in the online mental health study were e-mailed out to all living EstBB participants with available e-mail addresses (N=184,622), followed by two e-mail reminders. The active data collection phase spanned over three months from March to May 2021. The preliminary response rate was 46.7% (N = 86,222) out of all who were contacted. We will present preliminary results on the comparison of respondents and non-respondents based on demographic data, psychiatric diagnoses in EHR and psychiatric polygenic risk scores. Discussion: Discussion: We have significantly expanded the EstBB resource with phenotypic information on a broad range of psychiatric symptoms and related phenotypes to facilitate future research in psychiatric genetics.

The present study seeks to elucidate the composition of the microbiota associated with the glass sponge Vazella pourtalesii and the functional strategies of the main symbionts. We combined microscopic approaches with metagenome-guided microbial genome reconstruction and amplicon community profiling towards this goal. Microscopic imaging revealed that the host and microbial cells appeared within dense biomass patches that are presumably syncytial tissue aggregates. Based on abundances in amplicon libraries and metagenomic data, SAR324 bacteria, Crenarchaeota, Patescibacteria and Nanoarchaeota were identified as abundant members of the V. pourtalesii microbiome and their genomic potentials were thus analyzed in detail. A general pattern emerged in that the V. pourtalesii symbionts had very small genome sizes in the range of 0.5-2.2 Mb and low GC contents, even below those of seawater relatives. Based on functional analyses of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), we propose two major microbial strategies: the “givers”, namely Crenarchaeota and SAR324, heterotrophs and facultative anaerobes, produce and partly secrete all required amino acids and vitamins. The “takers”, Nanoarchaeota and Patescibacteria, are anaerobes with reduced genomes that tap into the microbial community for resources, e.g., lipids and DNA, likely using pili-like structures. We posit that the existence of microbial cells in sponge syncytia together with the low-oxygen conditions in the seawater environment are factors that shape the unique compositional and functional properties of the microbial community associated with V. pourtalesii. Importance We investigated the microbial community of V. pourtalesii that forms globally unique, monospecific sponge grounds under low-oxygen conditions on the Scotian Shelf, where it plays a key role for its vulnerable ecosystem. The microbial community was found to be concentrated within biomass patches and is dominated by small cells (<1 μm). MAG analyses showed consistently small genome sizes and low GC contents, which is unusual in comparison to known sponge symbionts. These properties as well as the (facultatively) anaerobic metabolism and a high degree of interdependence between the dominant symbionts regarding amino acid and vitamin synthesis are likely adaptations to the unique conditions within the syncytial tissue of their hexactinellid host and the low-oxygen environment.","Bayer, Kristina; Busch, Kathrin; Kenchington, Ellen; Beazley, Lindsay; Franzenburg, Sören; Michels, Jan; Hentschel, Ute; Slaby, Beate M.",bioRxiv,733,26

We now extended our study to more states in Fall 2020 to confirm the prevalence relationships we found previously. Vaccines were still not available as of Fall 2020. Presumably, the SARS-CoV-2 strain circulating at the time was the wild-type lineage since no variants were reported in the US until the end of December 2020. METHODS: We examined data from 19 U.S. states experiencing surges in cases to determine prevalence of COVID-19, and a prevalence-related measure: [Number of cases observed in a given age group] / [Number of cases expected in the age group based on population demographics]. RESULTS: In 16 of the 19 states, we found that: (1) prevalence of COVID-19 for adolescents and youth was significantly greater than for older adults (p-values ranged from p<0.00001 to p = 0.0175; (2) the ratio of cases observed to cases expected was significantly greater in adolescents and youth than in older adults (p-values ranging from p< 0.00001 to p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with our previous study in Summer 2020. The finding of lower prevalence in older adults cannot be attributed to access to vaccination since our data are from Fall 2020 when vaccinations were not yet available. Our findings with the SARS-CoV-2 wild-type strain are consistent with the findings currently being reported in the UK for the delta variant. In both studies, prevalence in adolescents and youth exceeded that in older adults. The UK findings are more pronounced perhaps because that study transpired following months of vaccinations of older adults whereas ours occurred before vaccinations were available.","Rumain, B.

To explore community stakeholders' perceptions about obtaining nutritious and age-appropriate foods for children ages 0-3 years prior and as a result of COVID-19. Stakeholders (n = 15) with a vested interest or currently working with families with infants or toddlers in Florida participated in a 60-minute interview via Zoom by trained researchers using a semi-structured script. The PRECEDE component of the PRECEDE-PROCEED model was used to inform the interview questions. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded by 2 researchers using an inductive approach. Before COVID-19, stakeholders perceived that families of infants and toddlers were not aware of available resources related to food security in the community. Stakeholders' stated resources such as baby foods and nutrition education were limited. Since COVID-19, resources related to food security have become even more restricted due to the increased demand, lack of transportation, and new safety protocols (ie, limited hours, social distancing, etc.). Moreover, the stigma associated with applying for supplemental assistance was noted as a barrier to food security prior to and as a result of COVID-19.

This has forced governments around the world to take blockade measures to prevent the spread of the virus. The majority of sectors of development is effected due to COVID-19. To lessen the spread of this caused disease good number of preventive measures is considered and one of them is covering with mask in crowded sites. This is also declared to be one of the effective methods according to WHO (World Health Organization). Reports indicate that wearing facemasks while at work, in public places, manufacturing setup reduces the risk of transmission. As a solution, an efficient and economical approach of using deep learning allows to create a safe environment in a manufacturing setup and public places. The system proposed within this project, restricts the unease spread of coronavirus by differentiating individuals with and without mask in public places that is being tracked through Live feed cameras. If an individual not covered with a mask is found, the respective staff is instructed with a message, and an alert sound message to ' Wear the mask' is given to the person. The dataset which is collected from different sources comprises the images of individuals covering with masks and not covering with masks.

Long-term lockdown policy has become the main reason for an increase in the unemployment rate all around the globe which has affected the economy of the developed and third world countries disastrously. This paper is written to suggest a solution for the COVID-19 pandemic. The best counter-strategy would be to clean a region with a preplanned structure of short-term lockdown using the Strategic Algorithm. The area needs to be divided into two equal parts and each part will then be further divided into five subparts. These parts will be cleaned and sanitized simultaneously through the specific set of rules determined by the Strategic Algorithm. Results of the cleaning mechanism are generated using simulation of non-deterministic and deterministic automata for each accepted or cleaned area in the JFLAP tool. The current study provides a short-term lockdown mechanism for cleaning a specific area and taking other strategic steps within the lockdown period to minimize the COVID-19 effects. © 2021 IEEE.,"Jabeen, S.; Malik, T.

Despite the fact the country has one of the world’s leading immunization programs, Brazil only slowly established a national COVID-19 vaccination strategy and campaign. This case study is based on an integrative review of primary and secondary literature sources. Different search strategies on Medline and Google Scholar were performed for the case presentation, for the management and outcome of the COVID-19 outbreak and for the state of the COVID-19 vaccination program. Official documents from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the website of the World Health Organization and pharmaceutical companies were also reviewed. Searches were limited to English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. This article describes the Brazilian COVID-19 vaccination campaign and the drivers and barriers to its implementation;and evaluates further investigations needed to have a conclusive overview over the constantly evolving situation. Healthcare inequalities, which were widened during the pandemic, a lack of coordination at the federal level, the absence of federal government support for scientific research and the lack of endorsement and commitment to the mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic set the country’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign off to a challenging start. However, Brazil had a well-developed primary care system and national vaccination program prior to the pandemic, which are both important facilitators. At the time of writing, six vaccines are currently available in the country, and the program is advancing. The scientific community needs to continue to investigate the country’s vaccination strategy and its implementation to make sure that maximum effort is undertaken for the health of the Brazilian population.","Bernardeau-Serra, Llanos Nguyen-Huynh Agathe Sponagel Lara Sernizon Guimarães Nathalia Teixeira de Aguiar Raphael Augusto Soriano Marcolino Milena",Epidemiologia,733,2

Pro-inflammatory cytokines increase catabolic activity and may perpetuate inflammation following joint trauma. Interleukin-15 (IL-15), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is increased in OA patients, although its roles in OA pathophysiology are not well characterized. IL-15 levels appear to correlate to self-reported pain levels, and polymorphisms in the IL-15 receptor alpha gene correlate to a 1.5-fold increase in OA symptoms. This could be due to IL-15 effects on the activity of proteinases, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) −1, −3, and −7. Here we utilized Il15 deficient rats to examine the role of IL-15 in PTOA pathogenesis in an injury-induced model of OA. OA was surgically induced in Il15 deficient rats and control wild-type rats to compare PTOA progression. Semi-quantitative scoring of the articular cartilage, subchondral bone, osteophyte size, and synovium was performed by two blinded observers. Analyses of articular cartilage damage, subchondral bone damage, and osteophyte formation revealed no significant difference between Il15 deficient rats and wild-type rats following PTOA-induction. Similarly, synovitis scoring across 6 parameters found no significant difference between genetic variants. Overall, IL-15 does not appear to play a key role in the development of structural changes in this surgically-induced rat model of PTOA.","Hadzic, Ermina; Blackler, Garth; Dupuis, Holly; Renaud, Stephen J; Appleton, C.

None of the staff was aware of this Audit and this was an entirely random observation. We used a standard proforma in order to audit. Followed by the Audit, we trained the staff in the unit and then re-audited.Result98% of them wore mask whilst in the ward and 94% of them washed their hands after doffing. 36% did not wear them appropriately and about 10-14% did not wear PPE at all. A mere 7 out of 50 alone used hand gel. Overall the donning and doffing of PPE was not being followed and adhered to according to the standards from PHE as per the first Audit. In particular, during donning only 1/3rd of them donned the PPE as per guidance. Likewise, the doffing technique was also poor, with only half of them removing the apron and mask correctly. Unfortunately, only 7 of the 50 people were observed to have used hand gel in between the doffing. This could be potentially increasing the risk of the spread of the coronavirus.We had trained almost 150 staff members in the Heddfan unit with regard to PPE/ donning and doffing.Handwashing prior to donning was achieved by all the staff. All the staff, that is 100 % of them adhered to the donning technique in line with the guidance in comparison to just 64% during the first Audit. Whilst hardly just 1/2 to 2/3rd of the staff followed the doffing technique adequately, the second audit showed that only 2 of the 50 staff did not follow the guidance. A meagre/ handful of them followed the utilisation of hand gel in between the tasks of doffing during the first Audit. Almost 90% of them followed the technique properly during the second Audit.

In Switzerland, compulsory use of masks was introduced in indoor public spaces and later in schools. In the canton of Zurich, masks were introduced for secondary school children (grades 7-9) from November 2020, and for primary school children (grades 4-6) from February 2021- along with other protective measures against SARS-CoV-2. This study explored perceptions towards the usefulness of masks in school and public in a cohort of children and adolescents in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, in January - May 2021. Methods: School children aged 10 to 17 years enrolled in Ciao Corona, a prospective school-based cohort study, responded to nested online surveys between January 12 to March 24 2021 (Q1) and March 10 to May 16 2021 (Q2). Secondary school children were surveyed at Q1 and Q2, and primary school children at Q2 only. Surveys for parents and their children included questions on children's perception of the usefulness of masks and mask wearing behavior. Associations between perceived usefulness of masks and child's school level, gender, and parents' educational attainment were analyzed with Pearson's and McNemar's chi-squared tests. Free-text comments provided by children were classified into categories of expressed attitude towards mask wearing. Results: 595 (54% girls) and 1118 (52% girls) school children responded to online questionnaires at Q1 and Q2, respectively. More than half of school children perceived masks to be useful at school (Q1:60% and Q2:57%) and in public (Q1:69% and Q2:60%). Girls perceived masks as useful more often than boys (at Q2 at school: 61% versus 53%, in public: 64% versus 57%), and children of parents with high educational attainment more often than those of parents with lower educational attainment (at Q2 at school: 61% versus 49%, in public: 63% versus 54%). There were no differences in the perceived usefulness of masks among children in primary versus secondary school. At Q1 and Q2 each, about 20% of children provided individual statements about masks, of which 36% at Q1 and 16% at Q2 reported side-effects and discomfort such as skin irritations, headache or difficulties breathing during physical education. Conclusion: Approximately 60% of school children perceived masks at school and in public places as useful. A small but non-negligible proportion of children reported discomfort and side-effects that should be considered to ensure high adherence to mask wearing among school children.","Ammann, P.; Ulyte, A.; Haile, S.

The approved COVID19 vaccines have shown great promise in reducing disease transmission and severity of outcomes. However, the success of the COVID19 vaccine rollout is dependent on public acceptance and willingness to be vaccinated. In this study, we aim to examine how the attitude towards public sector officials and the government impact vaccine willingness with a secondary aim to understand the impact of ethnicity on this relationship. Methods: This crosssectional study used data from a UK population based longitudinal household survey (Understanding Society COVID19 study, Understanding Society: the UK Household Longitudinal Study) between April 2020 to January 2021. Data from 22421 participants in Waves 6 and 7 of the study were included after excluding missing data. Demographic details in addition to previous survey responses relating to public sector/governmental trust were included in as covariates in the main analyses. A logit model was produced to describe the association between public sector/governmental mistrust and the willingness for vaccination with interaction terms included to account for ethnicity/socioeconomic status. Findings: In support of existing literature, we identified those from BAME groups were more likely to be unwilling to take the COVID19 vaccine. We found that positive opinions towards public sector officials (OR 2.680: 95% CI 1.888 3.805) and the UK government (OR 3.400; 95% CI 2.454 4.712) led to substantive increase in vaccine willingness. Most notably we identified this effect to be vary across ethnicity and socioeconomic status with those from South Asian background (OR 4.513; 95% CI 1.012 20.123) the most unwilling to be vaccinated when their trust in public sector officials were affected. Interpretation: These findings suggests that trust in public sector officials may play a key factor in the low vaccination rates particularly seen in at risk groups. Given the additional morbidity/mortality risk posed by COVID19 to those from lower socioeconomic or ethnic minority backgrounds, there needs to be urgent public health action to review how to tailor health promotion advice given to these groups and examine methods to improve trust in public sector officials and the Government.

To enable scRNA-seq for the vast majority of animals on the planet, here we introduce the concept of “k-mer homology,” combining biochemical synonyms in degenerate protein alphabets with uniform data subsampling via MinHash into a pipeline called Kmermaid. Implementing this pipeline enables direct detection of similar cell types across species from transcriptomic data without the need for a reference genome. Underpinning Kmermaid is the tool Orpheum, a memory-efficient method for extracting high-confidence protein-coding sequences from RNA-seq data. After validating Kmermaid using datasets from human and mouse lung, we applied Kmermaid to the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus), where we propagated cellular compartment labels at high fidelity. Our pipeline provides a high-throughput tool that enables analyses of transcriptomic data across divergent species’ transcriptomes in a genome- and gene annotation-agnostic manner.

TM9SF2 was validated as a player mediating heparan sulfate expression, explaining its contribution to vaccinia virus infection. In addition, TMED10 was found to be crucial for virus-induced plasma membrane blebbing and phosphatidylserine-induced macropinocytosis, suggesting that TMED10 regulates actin cytoskeleton remodelling necessary for virus infection. Importance Poxviruses are large DNA viruses that can infect a wide range of host species. A number of these viruses are clinically important to humans, including variola virus (smallpox) and vaccinia virus. Since the eradication of smallpox, zoonotic infections with monkeypox virus and cowpox virus are emerging. Additionally, poxviruses can be engineered to specifically target cancer cells, and are used as vaccine vector against tuberculosis, influenza, and coronaviruses. Poxviruses rely on host factors for most stages of their life cycle, including attachment to the cell and entry. These host factors are crucial for virus infectivity and host cell tropism. We used a genome-wide knock-out library of host cells to identify host factors necessary for vaccinia virus infection. We confirm a dominant role for heparin sulfate in mediating virus attachment. Additionally, we show that TMED10, previously not implicated in virus infections, modulates the host cell membrane to facilitate virus uptake.","Luteijn, Rutger D.; van Diemen, Ferdy; Blomen, Vincent A.; Boer, Ingrid G.J.; Sadasivam, Saran Manikam; van Kuppevelt, Toin H.; Drexler, Ingo; Brummelkamp, Thijn R.; Lebbink, Robert Jan; Wiertz, Emmanuel J.",bioRxiv,733,32

A meta-analysis suggests a definite benefit with the addition of colchicine in patients with COVID-19(2). It was suggested that colchicine can have efficacy for hospitalized patients with a severe course of COVID-19 and concurrent inflammatory rheumatic diseases who have a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (3). On the other hand, some reports suggested that colchicine is associated with an increased risk of infections (4). Currently, there are nine clinical trials using colchicine for COVID-19(5), nevertheless, the exact mechanism of action is not well understood. Objectives: Using publicly available transcriptomic data profiling human cells' response to colchicine to identify core differentially expressed genes (DEGs) then examine the dynamics of the identified DEGs in different datasets of COVID-19 transcriptomics databases to suggest the possible mechanisms of action on the molecular level. Methods: Gene Expression Omnibus was searched for human samples treated with colchicine compared to controls. GSE4090 dataset was identified where global gene expression of HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cell line) cells exposed to various concentrations of colchicine (n=9) compared to controls (n=7). We reanalyzed this datset using GEO2R online tool to identify DEGs. The identified DEGs were searched in SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome datasets using metascape online tool to identify gene sets were the DEGs identified showed significant similarity. Results: Fifty DEGs were identified in response to colchicine no matter what the concentration is used, (Figure 1A). Two gene sets (COVID323, RNA-Wilk-CD4+T-cells-patient-C2-Up [peripheral immune cells] and COVID008, RNA-Blanco-Melo-A549-Up[lung epithelial cells]) showed significant enrichment of the identified DEGs, (Figure 1B). SOCS3, ZC3H12C, CD55, GLIPR1, BACH1, PHLDA1, JUNB, NFKBIZ, and MYLIP were the shared genes between the identified DEGs, and the two gene sets with top enriched terms related to important immune-related pathways like IL-6, chemotaxis, leukocytes migration, cytokine release, and response to glucocorticoid, (Figure 1C). Only Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) was shared in the three datasets. SOCS3 expression was significantly downregulated in the HUVEC cells exposed to colchicine, (Figure 1D). Next, the normalized gene expression of SOCS3 from whole blood of 62 COVID-19 patients was compared to that of 24 healthy controls using (GSE15264) showed significant upregulation of SOCS3 in the blood of CVOID-19 patients indicating its role in COVID-19, (Figure 1E). Conclusion: Our reanalysis showed that the possible beneficial effect of colchicine in COVID-19 patients might be through its direct effect on SOCS3 which is specifically upregulated in COVID-19 by IL6 and interferon (IFN)-gamma.","Hachim, M.

In addition to risk factors such as overweight, age over 65 years, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and bronchial asthma, other chronic diseases should also be emphasized, taking into account possible immuno-suppressive therapy. This publication presents two clinical cases of COVID-19 infection in patients with multiple sclerosis treated with ocrelizumab. During the course of the disease, both patients developed a cytokine storm and were treated with IL-6 blockers. Both cases ended with recovery and a subsequent return to anti-B-cell therapy. Given the mechanism of action of ocrelizumab, there are higher risks of infectious complications, including with COVID-19, but mortality is not higher than the population average.

Detecting and localizing humans reliably and accurately in such an environment, however, is a prerequisite to many services offered by fleets of mobile robots collaborating with human workers. Consequently, in this paper, we expand on the concept of a topological particle filter (TPF) to accurately and individually localize and track workers in a farm environment, integrating information from heterogeneous sensors and combining local active sensing (exploiting a robot's onboard sensing employing a Next-Best-Sense planning approach) and global localization (using affordable IoT GNSS devices). We validate the proposed approach in topologies created for the deployment of robotics fleets to support fruit pickers in a real farm environment. By combining multi-sensor observations on the topological level complemented by active perception through the NBS approach, we show that we can improve the accuracy of picker localization in comparison to prior work.","Polvara, Riccardo; Duchetto, Francesco Del; Neumann, Gerhard; Hanheide, Marc",,733,16

This evolving trend has brought usually positive economic effects;however, it has also created some integration problems that include the process safety management. The Texas City BP accident in 2005 and its tremendous human and economic losses underlined the obstacles in defining a well‐structured corporation process safety management. The main causes of the above‐mentioned accident were connected to an inadequate safety culture at the managerial level. Strong leadership and high standards of corporate governance are required to inspire correct safety behavior in the staff. The so‐called soft skills become even more important in the Industry 4.0 arena, where the foundation of the whole system is based on an intelligent use and interpretation of data. The importance of this aspect is confirmed by several post-accidental analyses of past events. Although some research on this topic has been already done, it is worth it to dedicate some effort to identifying specific factors which influence the corporate process safety management quality, and, once identified, to assess them. This paper applies the concept of “lessons learnt” for the identification of organizational and managerial aspects worth consideration in process safety management. Based on accident and literature reviews and expert opinions, the aim is to identify the major contributing factors among leadership and safety culture, risk aware-ness, knowledge and competence, communication, and information and decision‐making processes. To self‐assess the level of commitment of the top leaders in process safety management, a checklist approach is proposed, combined with a quantitative, weighted evaluation based on the Relative Efficiency Indicator (REI). Positive value of REI may ensure the effectiveness of process safety management in major hazard industries and their appropriate adaptation to the corporation community. The proposed method, which is validated in an actual case study, underlines the importance of an appropriate education, and of a more careful selection of HSE managers. © 2021 by the authors.

However, it is unclear how the cellular proteostasis machines have evolved to adjust the protein biogenesis needs to environmental constraints. Herein, we describe a novel computational approach, based on semantic network analysis, to evaluate proteostasis during evolution. We show that the molecular components of the proteostasis network (PN) are reliable metrics to deconvolute the life forms into Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryotes and to assess the evolution rates among species. Semantic graphs were used as a new criterion to evaluate PN complexity of 94 Eukaryotes, 250 Bacteria and 93 Archaea, thus representing a novel strategy for taxonomic classification. This functional analysis provided information about species divergence and pointed towards taxonomic clades that evolved faster than others. Kingdom-specific PN were identified, suggesting that PN complexity correlates evolution. Through the analysis of gene conservation, we found that the gains or losses that occurred throughout PN evolution revealed a dichotomy within both the PN conserved modules and within species-specific modules. Since the PN is implicated in cell fitness, aging and disease onset, it could be used as a new metric to tackle mechanisms underlying ‘gain-of-functions’, and their biological ramifications.","Koutsandreas, Thodoris; Felden, Brice; Chevet, Eric; Chatziioannou, Aristotelis",bioRxiv,733,13

The largest disparity in coverage velocity between low and highly vulnerable counties was observed in Theme 3 (minority status & language). However, our model showed that highly vulnerable counties based on Theme 3 are expected to eventually achieve a higher proportion of vaccinated individuals compared to low vulnerable counterparts if current trajectories continue. Counties in the overall low vulnerability category are estimated to achieve a higher proportion of vaccinated individuals when compared to high and moderate vulnerable counties, assuming current trajectories. The largest disparity in asymptotic proportion vaccinated between high and low vulnerable counties was observed in Theme 2 (household composition & disability). Conclusion: This study provides insight into the problem of COVID-19 vaccine disparity across California which can be used to help promote equity during the current pandemic as well as guide the allocation of future vaccines such as COVID-19 booster shots.","Bruckhaus, A.; Abedi, A.; Salehi, S.; Pickering, T.

Thus, the aim of this investigation is to explore Chilean teachers' perceptions in relation to Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) within the COVID-19 context. The methodology includes a dynamic online questionnaire to allow a large number of educators to be included in the study. Some of the findings include the substantial curricular adaptation made by teachers, the use of teachers' own resources to contact students, the overall low level of satisfaction with remote teaching, as well as the increased working hours, and the different connectivity conditions and levels of student participation depending on the socio-economic profile of the school.

The neural mechanism by which this performance enhancement occurs remains unclear. We investigated this phenomenon by offering monetary reward to human participants, contingent on successful performance in a sequence production task. We found that people performed actions more quickly and accurately when they were offered large rewards. Increasing reward magnitude was associated with elevated activity throughout the brain prior to movement. Multivariate patterns of activity in these reward-responsive regions encoded information about the upcoming action. Follow-up analyses provided evidence that action decoding in pre-SMA and other motor planning areas was improved for large reward trials and successful action decoding was associated with improved performance. These results suggest that reward may enhance performance by enhancing neural representations of action used in motor planning. Highlights Reward enhances behavioral performance. Reward enhances action decoding in motor planning areas prior to movement. Enhanced action decoding coincides with improved behavioral performance.","Adkins, Tyler J.; Lee, Taraz G.",bioRxiv,733,6

Even worse, it is speculated that the situation may further deteriorate with a possible second wave. As governments around the world continue to impose increasingly stringent measures to fight and limit the spread of the pandemic, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools can play a significant role in the public health surveillance and diagnostics relating to COVID-19. AI is being heavily leveraged in the diagnosis of COVID-19, prediction of its severity for infection, and the discovery of related drugs and vaccines.

However, the complex relationship between antigen-specific B and T cells and the level of B cell repopulation necessary to achieve anti-vaccine responses remain largely unknown. Methods: Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and induction of antigen-specific B and CD4/CD8 T cell subsets were studied in 19 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) patients receiving RTX, 12 RA patients on other therapies and 30 healthy controls after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with either mRNA or vector based vaccines. Results: A minimum of 10 B cells/uL in the peripheral circulation was necessary in RTX patients to mount seroconversion to anti-S1 IgG upon SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. RTX patients lacking IgG seroconversion showed reduced antigen-specific B cells, lower frequency of TfH-like cells as well as less activated CD4 and CD8 T cells compared to IgG seroconverted RTX patients. Functionally relevant B cell depletion resulted in impaired IFNgamma secretion by spike-specific CD4 T cells. In contrast, antigen-specific CD8 T cells were reduced in patients independently of IgG formation. Conclusions: Patients receiving rituximab with B cell numbers above 10 B cells/ul were able to mount humoral and more robust cellular responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination that may permit optimization of vaccination in these patients. Mechanistically, the data emphasize the crucial role of co-stimulatory B cell functions for the proper induction of CD4 responses propagating vaccine-specific B and plasma cell differentiation.","Stefanski, A.-L.; Rincon-Arevalo, H.; Schrezenmeier, E.; Karberg, K.; Szelinski, F.; Ritter, J.; Jahrsdoerfer, B.; Schrezenmeier, H.; Ludwig, C.; Sattler, A.; Kotsch, K.; Chen, Y.; Claussnitzer, A.; Haibel, H.; Proft, F.; Guerra, G.

The best way to counter the spread of COVID-19 is self-protection. This study documents the development of a web-based serious game (WSG-COVID-19.SP) to promote effective learning strategies for self-protection against COVID-19 and to test the game’s content validity and usability. WSG-COVID-19.SP was developed using situated learning theory and diagnostic feedback mechanism. The game includes six situation storylines with 17 learning objectives. It uses a problem-solving approach to foster practices such as wearing masks, washing hands, and social distancing. Portfolio analysis was used to diagnose learning problems and report on the learning process. An overall summary index—the scale-level content validity index (S-CVI)— was used to evaluate content validity. Usability was tested through a website survey from 71 students from one university to gauge their technological acceptance and the game’s capability to promote future self-protection behaviors. The S-CVI was 0.81. Usability and acceptability were neither related to the users’ college major (whether it is information technology-related) nor to gender. Among the respondents, 84.5% agreed to continue with the self-protection practice as they were motivated by the real-time diagnostic function.

The emerging body of literature on fatigue in people with CP is characterised by substantial heterogeneity in assessment methods. To date, a systematic analysis of the measurement methods, and appraisal of the tools used to measure fatigue in people with CP has not been carried out. The aim of this review is to use The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as a framework to categorise and appraise current methods for measuring fatigue in people with CP. Methods and Design: Literature searches will be conducted in MEDLINE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Web of Science and Cochrane databases. Studies will be included in this systematic review if they purport to measure any type of fatigue in people with CP of any age through original research, are written in English and are published in peer-reviewed literature since 1980. From included studies we will extract the assessment methods used to measure fatigue, and demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample of people with CP. We will then provide a narrative synthesis of the type and ICF domain of fatigue purportedly measured and critical appraisal of the assessment methods used. Discussion: This review will summarise current methods for measuring fatigue in people with CP. Critical appraisal and systematic categorisation of assessment methods will allow us to identify areas for further research on the domains in which fatigue occurs, and the role of fatigue in relation to clustering with other symptoms. Findings are expected to guide future assessment of fatigue in people with CP.","Dutia, I.; Eres, R.; Sawyer, S. M.; Johnston, L.; Reddihough, D.; Cleary, S.; Coghill, D.",,733,1

The prison population is known to be a high-risk group for self-harm and suicide. The purpose of this study is to explore the trends in the frequency of self-harm over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic within a high-secure hospital. The authors hypothesised that the pandemic could adversely affect the mental health of patients, which could increase the rates of self-harm. Reasons for changes in the frequency of self-harm and the strategies used in response to the pandemic were also investigated. Design/methodology/approach: This paper encompasses findings from a quality improvement project that investigated self-harming behaviours from February 2020 to February 2021 in a high-secure psychiatric hospital. Incidents of self-harm were recorded based on the hospital’s ward structure. Data was collected on the incidence of self-harm rates over the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on how the pandemic may have had an effect on self-harm. Findings: This paper found an increase in the incidents of self-harm during the initial stages of the pandemic. The first national lockdown period yielded a rise in self-harm incidents from pre-COVID levels. The frequency of self-harm reduced following the first lockdown and returned to pre-COVID levels. The authors explored the psychological effects of COVID, isolation, interpersonal dynamics and changes in the delivery of care as reasons for these trends. Practical implications: This study demonstrates the substantial challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic to secure psychiatric services. Having an awareness of how the pandemic can impact on self-harm is important, as it allows the correct balance of restriction of our patients’ liberty to a degree deemed necessary to control the pandemic and the delivery of effective patient care. The key clinical implications include the importance of direct face-to-face patient contact, effective communication, therapeutic interventions and activities, the psychological impact of quarantine and the influence the pandemic can have on an individual’s function of self-harm. Originality/value: This paper is the first, to the authors’ knowledge, to explore the impact of COVID-19 in a high-security psychiatric hospital.

Materials and Methods The four adhesive drying techniques used were an air-stream, a micro-applicator, a cotton pellet and an absorbent paper. Adhesive systems were Single Bond Universal and Optibond All-in-one. The group in which the adhesive was not dried served as the negative control group. Enamel shear bond strength was performed with a universal tester with a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min (n=12). A two-way analysis of variance and the Tukey post-hoc test were used for analysis of the SBS data. Results For both adhesives, drying the adhesive with cotton pellet or micro-applicator provided a SBS mean values similar to air-stream drying, while statistically significantly lower SBS mean values were observed in the negative control group and in the absorbent paper-dry group compared to the air-drying group. Conclusions Drying the adhesive with micro-applicator and cotton pellets creates less aerosol and thus can be used in the COVID-19 pandemic as it provides enamel bonding strength similar to air drying. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE To provide safer dental care during COVID-19 pandemic, it is highly recommended to use non-aerosol-generating alternatives, instead of aerosolgenerating dental procedures. In this study, we found that the aerosol generation-free methods for adhesive-drying such as cotton pellet and micro applicator drying methods provide similar enamel bonding with conventional drying method. We think that our findings will contribute to the realization of safer adhesive dentistry practice, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ayar, Muhammet Kerim; Yesil, Onder",bioRxiv,733,24

The new case graphs from the simulations reflect the new case trends in both the US and New Jersey and can be used to understand the mechanism behind the rates of corona virus infection as well as predict future corona virus trends. Comparisons between the results of the simulations and observed data show the effectiveness of control measures such as quarantine, physical distancing, and wearing masks. The extended time period of control measures taken in New Jersey led to a gradual decline in new cases reported daily while the US new cases showed a second wave of growth after control measures were implemented to a lesser extent.","Liu, Fei; Lee, Clara",,733,1

The most widely used models for predicting viral outbreaks are the SIR and SEIR models and their modifications. The complexity of predicting the development of epidemics using these models is associated with the large uncertainty of the parameters included in these models;therefore, many researchers have attempted to apply machine learning methods for forecasting. The objects of our study were the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GOW) methods, as well as two machine learning models (MLP multilayer perceptron and ANFIS adaptive network fuzzy inference system). Ranking the models in increasing order of their accuracy is not difficult, but in many cases it makes no sense, since the model predictions in the statistical sense differ little from each other (homogeneous) and therefore such models can be considered equivalent. The chapter describes an effective nonparametric tests both traditional and new for comparing the results of time series prediction, which makes it possible to assess their homogeneity and identify groups of forecasting methods whose forecast results differ statistically significantly from each other.

While minor year-to-year economic fluctuations have a minimal impact on the job market in the long term, recessions fundamentally alter its character, with the market remaining depressed for years after the economy itself has recovered. Compounding this problem is the oversupply of PhDs flooding the market at present, a consequence of the long training period of graduate school, which keeps PhD output high for many years after a wave of undergraduate enrolment peaks. A third factor is the trend in academia to short-term positions with high teaching loads, which leads to fewer openings for permanent jobs and a diminished need for faculty.

In this regard, it is no longer possible to see the pandemic as ""abnormal."" The best option for understanding the pandemic is to accept it as a new reality and respond to it, accordingly, including spiritually. The word ""spiritual"" in this article refers to realizing the significance of Christ's presence during the pandemic and even after the pandemic. In a very dynamic and utterly uncertain world, it takes an effort to live in Christ, which is also very dynamic and emerges in and through uncertainty. This idea is constructed based on emergentist and evolution, in particular Ilia Delio's idea about The Emergent Christ, and Gordon Kaufman's ideas about serendipitous creativity. The goal is to understand Christ as a certainty as well as uncertainty and as a spiritual way of living in the pandemic and post-pandemic.

Thirteen were non-Hispanic White and three were African-American. Participants in both groups were in varying stages of active treatment, remission, and recurrence.

There was occasional misalignment in mentor and mentee expectations for frequency and intensity of communication. Interestingly, it was more often the mentor who expected more contact. While some mentees did express a desire for mentor concordance (e.g. marital status, parenthood, recurrence status), compatibility of mentor-mentee pairs in our study was positive for pairs even when they were not concordant across all demographics. Compatibility issues arose when participants felt like there was a discordance in coping styles between them and their mentor or mentee. While mentees reported receiving other sources of support, having a mentor who had 'been in the trenches' was uniquely important, especially when COVID-19 restrictions prevented their families from accompanying them to treatments. Mentors reported numerous psychological benefits of being a mentor including feeling needed after retirement, fulfilling a promise to themselves, and giving hope to others. Participants reported benefits of giving and receiving peer mentorship for gynecologic cancer. Mentees accessed valuable insider information and mentors found purpose in their own cancer experiences. Assessing mentees' needs, including preferred modality and frequency of communication, and considering demographic concordance prior to matching is crucial to ensuring a successful match. Future iterations of the program should focus on training mentors to interact with mentees through multiple communication platforms, as well as to address additional mentee vulnerabilities introduced by the pandemic.

Objective: In the present study, we aimed to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and isolation/quarantine at home on lifestyle and daily diet, and to identify changes caused by the pandemic related to the nutritional status and food preferences of the Romanian population. Material and Method: We conducted a prospective observational study based on a structured questionnaire that included 30 items for investigating multiple aspects regarding the dietary habits in the context of the pandemic, quarantine and social isolation imposed by the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The questionnaire was disseminated on various online platforms accessible from any device with an internet connection in Romania, on social media groups between January and March 2021. The questionnaire was made online, using the Google Forms platform, this method being very useful for carrying out the proposed evaluation, as it facilitated the national dissemination of the evaluation questionnaire. The final study group consisted of 620 respondents from 35 counties of Romania. Results: Regarding weight status, we found that the respondents showed significantly more frequent weight fluctuations during the pandemic than before (p &lt;0.0001). The results showed an increase in the mean weight of the respondents during the pandemic vs. their mean weight before (p = 0.04). In contrast, there were no statistically significant differences between the BMI calculated before and during the pandemic (p = 0.3). Respondents, who had a chaotic diet (40.64%) before the pandemic, became significantly more organized in this regard during the pandemic (35.96%) (p = 0.008). Conclusions: We can state that the pandemic period and isolation at home analyzed in terms of eating habits had positive consequences for about half of the study participants which adopted an organized, diversified eating behavior and balanced lifestyle.","Nitu, I.; Rus, V.

The purpose of this study is to explore whether global virtual team (GVT) projects raise students' understanding of cultural differences. In addition, it is interesting to know how internationally disruptive events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic influence GVT projects. Design/methodology/approach The research involved two parts: In the first part, a two-wave longitudinal study was conducted to investigate how intercultural sensitivity and intercultural communication competence coevolve within a group of international students enrolled in a virtual business professional project. In the second part, using word clouds and topic modelling on the participants' perceptions, the study investigated whether the sudden disruption caused by the pandemic show similar results in performance, focussing primarily on the resilience of virtual teams. Further, the study explored participants' perceptions towards online learning in higher education institutions as well as the attitude of corporate organizations towards remote working in the post-pandemic years. Findings The results confirmed that GVT projects, in fact, do raise students' understanding of cultural differences and the need to adjust their behaviour accordingly in order to engage with their culturally different counterparts effectively. Participants reported an increase in their cognitive, behavioural and affective attributes. Research limitations/implications Among the limitations of this study is the relatively small number of student participants. Furthermore, the number of respondents from India dominated the sample. Since the Indian students were disproportionately affected by the shutdown, causing them to return often to rural areas with poor Internet connectivity, responses concerning the disruption caused by the pandemic may be overriding negative. The same could be said of responses from US-American students, who often rely heavily on-campus employment or whose parents became unemployed during the pandemic, and thus were faced with disproportionate economic insecurity. Practical implications This paper provides insights to the educators and international organizations on how such projects provide the skills essential for reducing costs, accessing knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) across borders, maintaining flexible work schedules and arrangements, and taking advantage of multiple time zones to increase productivity. Originality/value While highlighting the significance of cultural intelligence, this paper investigated how the sudden disruption caused by a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic impacts performance, focussing primarily on the resilience of virtual teams.","Swartz, S.; Shrivastava, A.",Higher Education Skills and Work-Based Learning,733,1

It captures a multidimensional representation of teachers, students, and parents' use of information communication technologies (ICTs) to mitigate this disruption caused by school closures. The study analyzes the evolving influences on individual and collective behaviour amid the pandemic. The methods consisted of a 5-week longitudinal study that included a survey and multiple interviews with the three stakeholder groups. The qualitative and quantitative data yielded the analysis of ICTs usage before and during social confinement. Further to our analysis, we categorize and discuss our findings. We also interpret results to capture design implications and generate a new concept for design. To finalize, we identified students' learning loss and learning variability as pressing issues, despite the availability of technological mediums. We believe that a collaborative learning system could mitigate such a challenge. We believe that such a system could connect students to a teaching community and imbue a sense of togetherness within the context of distance education. © 2021 ACM.","Sousa, D.

Many of the models being deployed are amenable to scalable stochastic inference techniques, and accordingly they are able to process single-cell datasets of realistic and growing sizes. However, the community-wide adoption of probabilistic approaches is hindered by a fractured software ecosystem resulting in an array of packages with distinct, and often complex interfaces. To address this issue, we developed scvi-tools (https://scvi-tools.org), a Python package that implements a variety of leading probabilistic methods. These methods, which cover many fundamental analysis tasks, are accessible through a standardized, easy-to-use interface with direct links to Scanpy, Seurat, and Bioconductor workflows. By standardizing the implementations, we were able to develop and reuse novel functionalities across different models, such as support for complex study designs through nonlinear removal of unwanted variation due to multiple covariates and reference-query integration via scArches. The extensible software building blocks that underlie scvi-tools also enable a developer environment in which new probabilistic models for single cell omics can be efficiently developed, benchmarked, and deployed. We demonstrate this through a code-efficient reimplementation of Stereoscope for deconvolution of spatial transcriptomics profiles. By catering to both the end user and developer audiences, we expect scvi-tools to become an essential software dependency and serve to formulate a community standard for probabilistic modeling of single cell omics.","Gayoso, Adam; Lopez, Romain; Xing, Galen; Boyeau, Pierre; Wu, Katherine; Jayasuriya, Michael; Melhman, Edouard; Langevin, Maxime; Liu, Yining; Samaran, Jules; Misrachi, Gabriel; Nazaret, Achille; Clivio, Oscar; Xu, Chenling; Ashuach, Tal; Lotfollahi, Mohammad; Svensson, Valentine; Beltrame, Eduardo da Veiga; Talavera-López, Carlos; Pachter, Lior; Theis, Fabian J.; Streets, Aaron; Jordan, Michael I.; Regier, Jeffrey; Yosef, Nir",bioRxiv,733,5

We conducted a multi-laboratory evaluation of 21 commercial high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 serological assays using blinded panels of 1,000 highly-characterized blood-donor specimens. Assays demonstrated a range of sensitivities (96%-63%), specificities (99%-96%) and precision (IIC 0.55-0.99). Durability of antibody detection in longitudinal samples was dependent on assay format and immunoglobulin target, with anti-spike, direct, or total Ig assays demonstrating more stable, or increasing reactivity over time than anti-nucleocapsid, indirect, or IgG assays. Assays with high sensitivity, specificity and durable antibody detection are ideal for serosurveillance. Less sensitive assays demonstrating waning reactivity are appropriate for other applications, including characterizing antibody responses after infection and vaccination, and detection of anamnestic boosting by reinfections and vaccine breakthrough infections.

The communications effort has also been made more difficult by the confusion and cacophony in the media and claims by experts and politicians worldwide. While Singapore secured much praise for its handling of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) just 4 years earlier which threatened its very existence as a nation-state, it also had to ""unlearn"" and ""unfix"" assumptions and mindsets that grew out of that experience. A protracted crisis of uncertainty has also raised difficult questions of sustaining public awareness and alertness. Compounding these problems is the seemingly high reliance of Singaporeans on Government to manage the crisis at all stages. Risk communications has become a crucial necessity in an increasingly troubled world and evokes contradictions for many in medicine and public health - calling on Governments to raise the alarm whilst also calming fears at the same time. It is hoped that Singapore's experience throws up some useful lessons for other countries. The basic principles of risk communications employed are in line with the best practices adopted by many other countries. The experience may also contribute to the ongoing and somewhat contentious debate on whether the manner in which Singapore manages the information flow can be replicated or applied by other states and cultures.","Menon, K U","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",733,1

Demographic inference based on coalescent theory has been used to reconstruct the population dynamics and evolutionary history of several species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), an important human pathogen causing tuberculosis. One key assumption of the Kingman coalescent is that the number of descendants of different individuals does not vary strongly, and violating this assumption could lead to severe biases caused by model misspecification. Individual lineages of MTB are expected to vary strongly in reproductive success because 1) MTB is potentially under constant selection due to the pressure of the host immune system and of antibiotic treatment, 2) MTB undergoes repeated population bottlenecks when it transmits from one host to the next, and 3) some hosts show much higher transmission rates compared to the average (""super-spreaders""). Here we used an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach to test whether multiple merger coalescents (MMC), a class of models that allow for large variation in reproductive success among lineages, are more appropriate models to study MTB populations. We considered eleven publicly available whole genome sequence data sets sampled from local MTB populations and outbreaks, and found that MMC had a better fit compared to the Kingman coalescent for ten of the eleven data sets. These results indicate that the null model for analyzing MTB outbreaks should be reassessed, and that past findings based on the Kingman coalescent need to be revisited.","Menardo, F; Gagneux, S; Freund, F",Mol. biol. evol,733,20

AIM OF THE STUDY: We described and compared the clinical presentation and radiological and hematological data of a cohort of symptomatic COVID19 positive T2DM diabetic patients (n = 59) versus another cohort of non-diabetic symptomatic COVID19 positive patients (n =244) diagnosed at the same time from January 2020 to May 2020. Associated comorbidities were -assessed, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index was calculated. The outcomes including duration of hospitalization, duration of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and duration of O2 -supplementation were assessed. RESULTS: Prevalence of T2DM in symptomatic COVID19 positive patients was 59/303 (=19.5%). Diabetic patients had higher prevalence of hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiac dysfunction [coronary heart disease (CHD)], and congestive heart failure (CHF). Charlson Comorbidity score was significantly higher in the T2DM patients (2.4± 1.6) versus the non-diabetic -patients (0.28 ± 0.8; p: < 0.001). Clinically and radiologically, T2DM patients had significantly higher percentage of pneumonia, severe pneumonia and ARDS versus the non-diabetic patients. Hematologically, diabetic patients had significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP), higher absolute neutrophilic count (ANC) and lower counts of lymphocytes and eosinophils compared to non-diabetic patients. They had significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures, longer duration of hospitalization, ICU stay, mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. CRP was correlated significantly with the duration of stay in the ICU and the duration for oxygen supplementation (r = 0.37 and 0.42 respectively; p: <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: T2DM patients showed higher inflammatory response to COVID 19 with higher absolute neutrophilic count (ANC) and CRP with lower lymphocytic and eosinophilic counts.

Recent studies in the literature as well as dramatic changes in clinical practice over the past decade, though, would suggest that such a precise measure by IC to set energy goals is not required to maximize clinical benefit from early feeding in the intensive care unit (ICU). Results from randomized controlled trials evaluating permissive underfeeding, use of supplemental parenteral nutrition to achieve tight calorie control, and caloric density of formulas to increase energy delivery have provided an important perspective on 3 pertinent issues. First, a simple weight-based predictive equation (25 kcal/kg/day) provides a clinically useful approximation of EE. Second, a precise measure of EE by IC does not appear to improve outcomes compared with use of this less accurate estimation of energy requirements. And third, providing some percentage of requirements (50%-80%), achieves similar clinical benefit to full feeding (100%) in the early phases of critical illness. The value from IC use lies in the determination of caloric requirements in conditions for which weight-based equations are rendered inaccurate (anasarca, amputation, severe obesity) or the clinical state is markedly altered (such as the prolonged hyperinflammatory state of coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]). In most other circumstances, routine use of IC would not be expected to change clinical outcomes from early nutrition therapy in the ICU.","McClave, Stephen A; Omer, Endashaw",Nutr Clin Pract,733,29

In this study, a total of 512 bat faecal samples from the bat habitats at different geographical locations in South Korea were investigated between 2016 and 2019. Seventy-eight samples were positive for coronaviruses (15.2%), comprising 68 alphacoronaviruses (13.3%) and 10 betacoronaviruses (2.0%). The positive rates tended to increase during the awakening (April) period. Notably, betacoronaviruses were only found in the site where Rhinolophus ferrumequinum was the major species of bats, and were related to SARS- and MERS-related CoVs identified in China and South Korea, respectively. No betacoronaviruses were closely related to SARS-CoV-2 in this study. Alphacoronaviruses were detected in the sites where Hypsugo alaschanicus, Miniopterus fuliginosus, Miniopterus schreibersii, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Myotis bombinus, Myotis macrodactylus and Myotis petax were found to be the major bat species. Furthermore, alphacoronaviruses had higher genetic diversity than betacoronaviruses and had a wider distribution in Korea. Considering that different bat species are co-roosting in crowded conditions in the same habitat, the diverse coronaviruses in Korean bats are likely to undergo cross-species transmission events due to the richness in host species. Therefore, continuous monitoring should be performed, especially at the awakening time of the hibernating bats in the habitats where diverse bat species co-roost, to better understand the evolution of coronaviruses in bats.","Lo, Van Thi; Yoon, Sun-Woo; Noh, Ji Yeong; Kim, Youngji; Choi, Yong Gun; Jeong, Dae Gwin; Kim, Hye Kwon",,733,16

It's not so easy with the pandemic to find the villain, which is why, again classically, when a pandemic or an epidemic occurs, what the historians tell us is that usually what happens is that at the beginning, there is group solidarity, a great feeling of hope, of working together. But what we see with the pandemic and the medical response to the pandemic is that a different concept of human life is at play here, which the historians and sociologists who study this argue is a product of late capitalism;that a human life is defined by a set of purely biological parameters.

Overall, Worthen's marriage of fundamental concepts from the philosophy of technology to wide-ranging theories from theater scholarship may require readers to arrive to his text with more knowledge of the latter than most scholars of technology typically cultivate;however, for those with a background in both subjects, Worthen's analysis suggests many exciting avenues of exploration—not only about technologies of dramatic theater in particular, but also in any area where technologies assist in representation or the creation of meaning. Aebischer divides her argument into three somewhat independent sections, in each of which she examines recent (2013–16) productions of the plays of early modern dramatists such as Shakespeare, Marlowe, and Middleton, mostly located in London, U.K. In the first third of the book, she uses two productions at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse to explore the affordances of the technologies of architecture and seating, demonstrating that different sightlines, in combination with the way performers use those sightlines, contribute to different social, political, and ethical meanings for different audience members.","Kriger, Sarah",Technology and Culture,733,24

The main active ingredients and therapeutic targets of the Xuebijing injection, and the pathogenic targets of COVID-19 were screened using the TCMSP, UniProt, and GeneCard databases. According to the 'Drug-Ingredients-Targets-Disease' network built by STRING and Cytoscape, AKT1 was identified as the core target, and baicalein, luteolin, and quercetin were identified as the active ingredients of the Xuebijing injection in connection with AKT1. R language was used for enrichment analysis that predict the mechanisms by which the Xuebijing injection may inhibit lipopolysaccharide-mediated inflammatory response, modulate NOS activity, and regulate the TNF signal pathway by affecting the role of AKT1. Based on the results of network pharmacology, a molecular docking was performed with AKT1 and the three active ingredients, the results indicated that all three active ingredients could stably bind with AKT1.

We assessed published cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and persistence, characterizing the hallmarks of reinfecting sequences and the rate of viral evolution in persistent infection. METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed was conducted to identify cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and persistence with available sequences. Nucleotide and amino acid changes in the reinfecting sequence were compared to both the initial and contemporaneous community variants. Time-measured phylogenetic reconstruction was performed to compare intra-host viral evolution in persistent SARS-CoV-2 to community-driven evolution. RESULTS: Twenty reinfection and nine persistent infection cases were identified. Reports of reinfection cases spanned a broad distribution of ages, baseline health status, reinfection severity, and occurred as early as 1.5 months or >8 months after the initial infection. The reinfecting viral sequences had a median of 17.5 nucleotide changes with enrichment in the ORF8 and N genes. The number of changes did not differ by the severity of reinfection and reinfecting variants were similar to the contemporaneous sequences circulating in the community. Patients with persistent COVID-19 demonstrated more rapid accumulation of sequence changes than seen with community-driven evolution with continued evolution during convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibody treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Reinfecting SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes largely mirror contemporaneous circulating sequences in that geographic region, while persistent COVID-19 has been largely described in immunosuppressed individuals and is associated with accelerated viral evolution.","Choudhary, Manish C; Crain, Charles R; Qiu, Xueting; Hanage, William; Li, Jonathan Z",Clin. infect. dis,733,25

These mainly involve the development of antimicrobial, antiviral, and/or anti-inflammatory agents as well as vaccine production. However, other potential options should be more avidly investigated since vaccine production on a worldwide level, and the anti-vaccination movement, also known as anti-vax or vaccine hesitancy by many communities, are still real obstacles without a ready solution. This review presents recent findings on the potential therapeutic advantages of heterologous serotherapy for the treatment of COVID-19. We present not only the effective use in animal models of hyperimmune sera against this coronavirus but also strategies, and protocols for the production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 sera. Promising antigens are also indicated such as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which is already in phase 2/3 clinical trial, and the trimeric protein S, which was shown to be up to 150 times more potent than the serum from convalescent donors. Due to the high death rate, the treatment for those currently infected with coronavirus cannot be ignored. Therefore, the potential use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune sera should be carefully but urgently evaluated in phase 2/3 clinical studies.","da Costa, Camila B P; Martins, Francislene J; da Cunha, Luis E R; Ratcliffe, Norman A; Cisne de Paula, Rafael; Castro, Helena C",Int Immunopharmacol,733,5

How to improve production performance under limited labor resources is an urgent problem for global manufacturing factories. This work studies an energy-efficient job-shop scheduling problem with limited workers. Those workers can have multiskills. A many-objective model with five objectives, that is: 1) makespan; 2) total tardiness; 3) total idle time; 4) total worker cost; and 5) total energy, is built. To solve this many-objective optimization problem (MaOP), a novel fitness evaluation mechanism (FEM) based on fuzzy correlation entropy (FCE) is adopted. Two construction methods for reference points are proposed to build the bridge between MaOP and a fuzzy set. Based on FCE and cluster methods, an environmental selection mechanism (ESM) is proposed to achieve a balance between solution convergence and diversity. With the proposed FEM and ESM, two many-objective evolutionary algorithms are proposed to solve MaOP. The effect of FCE-based FEM and ESM on the performance of algorithms is verified via experiments. The proposed algorithms are compared with four well-known peers to test their performance. The extensive experimental results show that they are very competitive for the considered many-objective scheduling problem.","Li, Wenfeng; He, Lijun; Cao, Yulian",IEEE trans. cybern. (Online),733,1

Using an observational, cross-sectional, and quantitative study design, a face-to-face field survey was conducted during the epidemic of COVID-19 in district Okara, Pakistan. A sample of 500 adults was selected from the city of Depalpur the in Okara district of Pakistan, using a two-stage sampling design with cluster sampling in stage one and systematic random sampling at stage two. A COVID-19 prevention behavior scale was computed based on twelve dichotomous items. Descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and negative binomial regression analyses were performed. The most common prevention behavior among study participants was avoiding going for walks in the parks (81.0%), followed by not leaving home during the lockdown (72.6%), and washing hands every day with soap and water for 20 s after going out of their home (64.0%). Fewer people exhibited prevention behaviors such as social distancing (e.g., staying at least six feet away from other people) which in the EU was recommended to be a minimum of 1.5-2 m (44.4%) and following all of the basic protective measures (e.g., hand washing, use of a face covering in public, social distancing) in order to protect against COVID-19 (33.0%). The results from the negative binomial regression analysis showed that after controlling for the other HBM constructs and sociodemographic factors, only the perceived benefits of preventative actions showed significant association with the prevention behavior scale (IRR, 1.16; CI, 1.061-1.276; p < 0.001).

To assess the optimal timing, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between web-based interest and new cases and deaths due to COVID-19. METHODS: Web-based interest for queries related to 'coronavirus' was assessed between 1 January and 19 June 2020, using Google Trends in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Italy, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States of America. Reliability analysis of the used search terms was performed using the intraclass correlation coefficient. To investigate the association between web-based interest and new COVID-19 cases or deaths, the relative search volume was analysed for correlation with new cases and deaths. RESULTS: Reliability analysis revealed excellent reliability for COVID-19 search terms in all countries. Web-based interest peaked between 23 February and 5 April 2020, which was prior to the peak of new infections and deaths in most included countries. There was a moderate to strong correlation between COVID-19 related queries and new cases or new deaths. CONCLUSION: Web-based interest in COVID-19 peaked prior to the peak of new infections and deaths in most countries included.

We aimed to determine whether anakinra, a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist, could improve outcomes in patients in hospital with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, Bayesian randomised clinical trial (CORIMUNO-ANA-1), nested within the CORIMUNO-19 cohort, we recruited patients from 16 University hospitals in France with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, requiring at least 3 L/min of oxygen by mask or nasal cannula but without ventilation assistance, a score of 5 on the WHO Clinical Progression Scale (WHO-CPS), and a C-reactive protein serum concentration of more than 25 mg/L not requiring admission to the intensive care unit at admission to hospital. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a web-based secure centralised system, stratified by centre and blocked with varying block sizes (randomly of size two or four), to either usual care plus anakinra (200 mg twice a day on days 1-3, 100 mg twice on day 4, 100 mg once on day 5) or usual care alone. Usual care was provided at the discretion of the site clinicians. The two coprimary outcomes were the proportion of patients who had died or needed non-invasive or mechanical ventilation by day 4 (ie, a score of >5 on the WHO-CPS) and survival without need for mechanical or non-invasive ventilation (including high-flow oxygen) at day 14. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04341584, and is now closed to accrual. FINDINGS: Between April 8 and April 26, 2020, we screened 153 patients. The study was stopped early following the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board, after the recruitment of 116 patients: 59 were assigned to the anakinra group, and 57 were assigned to the usual care group. Two patients in the usual care group withdrew consent and were not analysed. In the analysable population, the median age was 66 years (IQR 59 to 76) and 80 (70%) participants were men. In the anakinra group, 21 (36%) of 59 patients had a WHO-CPS score of more than 5 at day 4 versus 21 (38%) of 55 in the usual care group (median posterior absolute risk difference [ARD] -2·5%, 90% credible interval [CrI] -17·1 to 12·0), with a posterior probability of ARD of less than 0 (ie, anakinra better than usual care) of 61·2%. At day 14, 28 (47%; 95% CI 33 to 59) patients in the anakinra group and 28 (51%; 95% CI 36 to 62) in the usual care group needed ventilation or died, with a posterior probability of any efficacy of anakinra (hazard ratio [HR] being less than 1) of 54·5% (median posterior HR 0·97; 90% CrI 0·62 to 1·52). At day 90, 16 (27%) patients in the anakinra group and 15 (27%) in the usual care group had died. Serious adverse events occurred in 27 (46%) patients in the anakinra group and 21 (38%) in the usual care group (p=0·45).

Effective target therapy for renal injury has yet been developed. Besides, potential anti-COVID-19 medicines have also been reported to cause adverse side effects to kidney. Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM), however, has rich experience in treating renal injury and has successfully applied in China in the battle of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of CHM treatment are still unclear. In this study, we searched prescriptions in the treatment of renal injury extensively and the potential mechanisms to treat COVID-19 related renal injury were investigated. The association rules analysis showed that the core herbs includes Huang Qi, Fu Ling, Bai Zhu, Di Huang, Shan Yao. TCM herbs regulate core pathways, such as AGE-RAGE, PI3K-AKT, TNF and apoptosis pathway, etc. The ingredients (quercetin, formononetin, kaempferol, etc.,) from core herbs could modulate targets (PTGS2 (COX2), PTGS1 (COX1), IL6, CASP3, NOS2, and TNF, etc.), and thereby prevent the pharmacological and non-pharmacological renal injury comparable to that from COVID-19 infection. This study provides therapeutic potentials of CHM to combat COVID-19 related renal injury to reduce complications and mortality.","He, Tian; Qu, Rendong; Qin, Caimeng; Wang, Zheyi; Zhang, Yue; Shao, Xiangming; Lu, Tao",Saudi pharmaceutical journal,733,16

Like two other notable beta coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 can lead to severe contagious respiratory disease. Due to impaired cellular immunity and physiological changes, pregnant women are susceptible to respiratory disease and are more likely to develop severe pneumonia. Given the prevalence of COVID-19, it is speculated that some pregnant women have already been infected. However, limited data are available for the clinical course and management of COVID-19 in pregnancy. Therefore, we conducted this review to identify strategies for the obstetric management of COVID-19. We compared the clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19, SARS, and MERS in pregnancy and discussed several drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 in pregnancy.","Mei, Youwen; Luo, Dan; Wei, Sumei; Liao, Xiaoyan; Pan, Yue; Yang, Xiao; Lin, Yonghong",Front.

The continued spread of the virus and increasing death toll necessitate the development of effective antiviral treatments to combat this virus. To this end, we evaluated a new class of organometallic complexes as potential antivirals. Our findings demonstrate that two pentamethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp*) rhodium piano stool complexes, Cp*Rh(1,3-dicyclohexylimidazol-2-ylidene)Cl2 (complex 2) and Cp*Rh(dipivaloylmethanato)Cl (complex 4), have direct virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent in vitro testing suggests that complex 4 is the more stable and effective complex and demonstrates that both 2 and 4 have low toxicity in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells. The results presented here highlight the potential application of organometallic complexes as antivirals and support further investigation into their activity.","Chuong, Christina; DuChane, Christine M; Webb, Emily M; Rai, Pallavi; Marano, Jeffrey M; Bernier, Chad M; Merola, Joseph S; Weger-Lucarelli, James",Viruses,733,20

The author outlines similarities and differences of these de facto borders in comparison with internationally recognized ones and compares border policies implemented by individual post-Soviet de facto states. While de facto states utilized their borders to combat the pandemic largely in the same ways as recognized states did, their pandemic border regimes were less legitimate for the international community and thus de facto states were more dependent on cross-border relations with their “patrons,” having no other viable options. The author also argues that even de facto states with similar geographical and political conditions chose partially different policies for managing pandemic bordered restrictions. © 2021 Association for Borderlands Studies.","Golunov, S.",Journal of Borderlands Studies,733,2

For patients in general, the clinical features resulting from respiratory syndromes can trigger an asymptomatic condition. However, 25 % of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 can progress to severity. Pregnant women are an unknown field in this complex process, and although they have symptoms similar to non-pregnant women, some points should be considered, such as complications during pregnancy and postpartum. Thus, the aim of this study was to understand the consequences of pregnancy and fetal development, caused by infections by the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Among the aforementioned infections, MERS-CoV seems to be the most dangerous for newborns, inducing high blood pressure, pre-eclampsia, pneumonia, acute renal failure, and multiple organ failure in mother. This also causes a higher occurrence of emergency cesarean deliveries and premature births, in addition, some deaths of mothers and fetuses were recorded. Meanwhile, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 appear to have less severe symptoms. Furthermore, although a study found the ACE2 receptor, used by SARS-CoV-2, widely distributed in specific cell types of the maternal-fetal interface, there is no evidence of vertical transmission for any of the coronaviruses. Thus, the limited reported obstetric cases alert to the need for advanced life support for pregnant women infected with coronaviruses and to the need for further investigation for application in clinical practice.","de Souza Silva, Guilherme Antonio; da Silva, Suéllen Pedrosa; da Costa, Marcos Aurélio Santos; da Silva, Abdênego Rodrigues; de Vasconcelos Alves, Robson Raion; Ângelo Mendes Tenório, Fernanda das Chagas; da Silva Melo, Alanne Rayssa; de Freitas, Antonio Carlos; Lagos de Melo, Cristiane Moutinho",J Gynecol Obstet Hum Reprod,733,21

A retrospective cluster study was conducted to evaluate long-term sexual and urinary functioning after RARP and Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy (LRP) based on real-world data from 12 Dutch hospitals. METHODS: Data was collected from patients who underwent surgery between 2010 and 2012. A mixed effect model was used to evaluate differences between groups on urinary and sexual functioning (EPIC-26). Additionally, a regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between these functional outcomes and, among others, hospital volume. RESULTS: 1370 (65.1%) patients participated, 907 underwent RARP and 463 LRP, with a median follow-up time of 7.08 years (SD = 0.98). The RARP group showed a statistically and clinically significant better urinary functioning compared to the LRP group (p = 0.002). RARP showed also a shorter procedure time (p=<0.001), reduced blood loss (p=<0.001), and a higher chance of neurovascular bundle preservation (39.8% vs 29.1%; p=<0.01). CONCLUSION: RARP resulted in better long-term urinary function compared to LRP. Based on the results from this study, guidelines concerning the preferred surgery type and the position on reimbursement may change, especially when RARP proves to be cost-effective.","Lindenberg, Melanie M A; Retèl, Valesca V P; Kieffer, Jacobien J M; Wijburg, Carl C; Fossion, Laurent L M C L; van der Poel, Henk H G; van Harten, Wim W H",Eur. j. surg. oncol,733,33

The COVID-19 crisis has global impacts in financial, health and social aspects and service industries are at the forefront of the pervasive impacts. This study investigated how college students' perceptions of COVID-19 interplayed with self-efficacy on their academic plans and further identified major differences between students in service-oriented and nonservice-oriented majors. Design/methodology/approach - A self-administered online survey was conducted with 299 undergraduates at a large Midwestern university during COVID-19. Regression analyses, including conditional analyses, examined the study hypotheses using SPSS. Findings - The results showed that, in general, students' self-efficacy reduced their intentions to change their academic majors. The joint effects of self-efficacy and perception of COVID-19 diverged among students in nonservice-oriented majors but converged among students in service-oriented majors (e.g. hospitality and tourism). These students in the service fields showed more commitment to their current majors even as their concerns about the social implications of COVID-19 increased. Practical implications - This study suggests that academic institutions should try to improve students' self-efficacy to maintain their career commitments during crisis times. Furthermore, service organizations should highlight the importance of social aspects as recovery from COVID-19 begins as a tool to recruit college graduates. Originality/value - The literature on career decisions of students in service industries is quite limited.

Out of 60,441 surveyed patients, 1368 were infected as of April 23rd, 2020. However, center-specific proportions showed substantial heterogeneity. We therefore undertook new analyses to identify explanatory factors, contextual effects, and decision rules for infection containment. METHODS: We investigated fixed factors and contextual effects by multilevel modeling. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was used to develop decision rules. RESULTS: Increased positivity among hemodialysis patients was predicted by center location [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-1.51], positive healthcare workers (IRR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.17), test-all policy (IRR 5.94, 95% CI 3.36-10.45), and infected proportion in the general population (IRR 1.002, 95% CI 1.001-1.003) (all p < 0.01). Conversely, lockdown duration exerted a protective effect (IRR 0.95, 95% CI 0.94-0.98) (p < 0.01). The province-contextual effects accounted for 10% of the total variability. Predictive factors for peritoneal dialysis and transplant cases were center location and infected proportion in the general population. Using recursive partitioning, we identified decision thresholds at general population incidence &#8805; 229 per 100,000 and at &#8805; 3 positive healthcare workers. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond fixed risk factors, shared with the general population, the increased and heterogeneous proportion of positive patients is related to the center's testing policy, the number of positive patients and healthcare workers, and to contextual effects at the province level. Nephrology centers may adopt simple decision rules to strengthen containment measures timely.","Nordio, Maurizio; Reboldi, Gianpaolo; Di Napoli, Anteo; Quintaliani, Giuseppe; Alberici, Federico; Postorino, Maurizio; Aucella, Filippo; Messa, Piergiorgio; Brunori, Giuliano",J. nephrol,733,8

The concept of posttraumatic growth (PTG) focuses on the perception of a positive change from the experience of a stressing situation. This study's objective was to evaluate PTG and different predictor variables for women (n = 84) with breast cancer in Brazil. METHOD: On this exploratory study, self-report scales referring to the diagnosis period and oncologic treatment were applied individually. RESULTS: Having a husband/partner, adaptive coping strategies and a religion of identification were found to be predictor variables in different established regressive models. Rumination did not show any correlation to PTG scores, refuting the results of previous studies. The results found in this study confirm previous research as for PTG predictors, except for rumination. CONCLUSIONS: Positive changes resulting from experiencing breast cancer are present in Brazilian women and different interventions can be thought of based on the study of predictors","Villanova Quiroga, Carolina; Bridi Dacroce, Luísa Raquel; Rudnicki, Tânia; Iracema de Lima Argimon, Irani",Psicooncología (Pozuelo de Alarcón),733,1

The aim of this research was to confirm that Holder pasteurization (62.5°C for 30 min) would be sufficient to inactivate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in donated human milk samples. METHODS: We spiked frozen milk samples from 10 donors to the Rogers Hixon Ontario Human Milk Bank with SARS-CoV-2 to achieve a final concentration of 1 × 107 TCID50/mL (50% of the tissue culture infectivity dose per mL). We pasteurized samples using the Holder method or held them at room temperature for 30 minutes and plated serial dilutions on Vero E6 cells for 5 days. We included comparative controls in the study using milk samples from the same donors without addition of virus (pasteurized and unpasteurized) as well as replicates of Vero E6 cells directly inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. We reported cytopathic effects as TCID50/mL. RESULTS: We detected no cytopathic activity in any of the SARS-CoV-2-spiked milk samples that had been pasteurized using the Holder method. In the SARS-CoV-2-spiked milk samples that were not pasteurized but were kept at room temperature for 30 minutes, we observed a reduction in infectious viral titre of about 1 log. INTERPRETATION: Pasteurization of human milk by the Holder method (62.5°C for 30 min) inactivates SARS-CoV-2. Thus, in the event that donated human milk contains SARS-CoV-2 by transmission through the mammary gland or by contamination, this method of pasteurization renders milk safe for consumption and handling by care providers.","Unger, Sharon; Christie-Holmes, Natasha; Guvenc, Furkan; Budylowski, Patrick; Mubareka, Samira; Gray-Owen, Scott D; O039,; Connor, Deborah L",CMAJ,733,16

However, further workup with dedicated chest computed tomography imaging demonstrated multiple bilateral, peripheral nodular lesions with peripheral ground-glass opacity, predominantly in the lower lung zone, that were suspicious for coronavirus disease 2019. The patient ultimately was diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 based on detection of viral ribonucleic acid via polymerase chain reaction. Follow-up chest computed tomography scan obtained after 27 days showed complete resolution of the lung lesions. In the setting of a global pandemic, a high index of suspicion for coronavirus disease 2019 in cancer patients is warranted, not only to enable early identification and treatment of a potentially aggressive infection but also to prevent misdiagnosis of metastatic disease.","Pai, Tanmayi S.; Rojas, Carlos Wasserman Martha C.; Parent, Ephraim E.; Cornell, Lauren Chumsri Saranya",Radiology Case Reports,733,1

In this study, we characterize the effect of high-fat diet on the mouse corneal neuroimmune phenotype, including changes to corneal nerve density and resident immune cells, alongside the clinical assessment of corneal thickness and endothelial cell density. METHODS: Male C57Bl6/J mice, aged 10 weeks, were fed a high-fat diet (60â¯kcal% fat, 5.2â¯kcal/g) or control diet (10â¯kcal%, 3.8â¯kcal/g) for 16 weeks. At the study endpoint, metabolic parameters (HbA1c, weight, fasting glucose, body fat) were measured to confirm metabolic disturbance. Clinical imaging of the anterior segment was performed using optical coherence tomography to measure the corneal epithelial and stromal thickness. Corneal sensory nerves were visualized using flatmount immunostaining and confocal microscopy. The topographical distribution and density of sensory nerves (BIII-tubulin+), intraepithelial CD45+ and MHC- II+ cells, stromal macrophages (IBA1+CD206+) and endothelial cells (ZO-1+) were analysed using FIJI. RESULTS: High-fat diet mice had significantly higher blood HbA1c, higher body weight, a higher percentage of body fat and elevated fasting glucose compared to the control diet mice. Corneal epithelial and stromal thickness was similar in both groups. The sum length of the basal nerve plexus was lower in the central and peripheral cornea of mice fed a high-fat diet. In contrast, the sum length of superficial nerve terminals was similar between groups. Epithelial immune cell density was two-fold higher in the central corneas of high-fat diet mice compared to control diet mice. IBA1+CD206+ macrophage density was similar in the anterior stroma of both groups but was significantly higher in the posterior stroma of the peripheral cornea in the high-fat diet mice compared to controls. The percentage of nerve-associated MHC-II+ cells in the epithelium and stroma was higher in HFD mice compared to controls. Endothelial cell density was similar in the corneas of high-fat diet mice compared to controls. CONCLUSION: Together with corneal neuropathy, corneal immune cells in mice fed a high-fat diet were differentially affected depending on their topographical distribution and location within cornea, and appeared in closer proximity to epithelial and stromal nerves, suggesting a local neuroimmune disruption induced by systemic metabolic disturbance.","Jiao, Haihan; Lim, Alicia Sl; Fazio Coles, Therese E; McQuade, Rachel M; Furness, John B; Chinnery, Holly R",Exp Eye Res,733,26

This entry event is mediated by a set of essential entry glycoproteins, including glycoprotein D (gD), gHgL, and gB. gHgL and gB are conserved among herpesviruses, but gD is unique to the alphaherpesviruses and is not encoded by all alphaherpesviruses. gD is a receptor-binding protein, the heterodimer gHgL serves as a fusion regulator, and gB is a class III viral fusion protein. Sequential interactions among these glycoproteins are thought to trigger the virus to fuse at the right place and time. Structural studies of these glycoproteins from multiple alphaherpesviruses has enabled the design and interpretation of functional studies. The structures of gD in a receptor- bound and in an unliganded form reveal a conformational change in the C terminus of the gD ectodomain upon receptor binding that may serve as a signal for fusion. By mapping neutralizing antibodies to the gHgL structures and constructing interspecies chimeric forms of gHgL, interaction sites for both gD and gB on gHgL have been proposed. A comparison of the post fusion structure of gB and an alternative conformation of gB visualized using cryo- electron tomography suggests that gB undergoes substantial refolding to execute membrane fusion. Although these structures have provided excellent insights into the entry mechanism, many questions remain about how these viruses coordinate the interactions and conformational changes required for entry.","Cairns, Tina M; Connolly, Sarah A",Curr Issues Mol Biol,733,7

Here, we firstly find that the survival outcome of female patients is better to male patients through analyzing the 3044 COVID-19 cases. Secondly, we identify many important master regulators [e.g. STAT1/STAT2 and zinc finger (ZNF) proteins], in particular female patients can express more ZNF proteins and stronger transcriptional activities than male patients in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thirdly, we discover that ZNF protein activity is significantly negative correlation with the SARS-CoV-2 load of COVID-19 patients, and ZNF proteins as transcription factors can also activate their target genes to participate in anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fourthly, we demonstrate that ZNF protein activity is positive correlation with the abundance of multiple immune cells of COVID-19 patients, implying that the highly ZNF protein activity might promote the abundance and the antiviral activity of multiple immune cells to effectively suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, our study proposes an underlying anti-SARS-COV-2 role of ZNF proteins, and differences in the amount and activity of ZNF proteins might be responsible for the distinct prognosis of different gender COVID-19 patients.","Qin, Shijie; Xu, Weijun; Wang, Canbiao; Jiang, Sizhu; Dai, Wei; Yang, Yang; Shen, Jiawei; Jin, Ping; Ma, Fei; Xia, Xinyi",Brief. bioinform,733,10

Despite this and other measures, the number of cases and deaths in Brazil has, so far,has increased exponentially, a fact that impacts the health and educational authorities, due to the exceptionality imposed on the development of teaching activities. Because of such context, the present study aimed to measure the frequency of the Flu Syndrome in medical students from Mato Grosso do Sul during the Covid-19 pandemic period, in order to propose resolutions for conducting academic activities. A descriptive,observational and cross-sectional study carried out among students enrolled in medicine school courses in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul.The data were obtained through a semi-structured, online questionnaire and based on the Google Forms platform. Descriptive results were prepared automatically, from the platform itself. Result: 371 responses were computed. Approximately 50% had flu-like symptoms, the most common of which were runny nose, nasal obstruction and cough. Among the diagnoses reported, the most described one was rhinosinusitis,with 7 participants presenting Covid-19.

Recent studies report that emergency departments have experienced a significant decline in the number of admitted patients in the early phase of the pandemic. To date, research regarding the influence of COVID-19 on emergency medical services (EMS) is limited. The present study investigates a change in the number and characteristics of EMS missions in the early phase of the pandemic. METHODS: All EMS missions in the Northern Ostrobothnia region, Finland (population 295 500) between 1 March to 30 June 2020 were screened and analyzed as the study group. A control group was composed from the EMS calls between the corresponding months in the years 2016-2019. RESULTS: A total of 74 576 EMS missions were screened for the study. Within the first two months after the first COVID-19 cases in the study area, the decline in the number of EMS missions was 5.7% - 13% compared to the control group average. EMS time intervals (emergency call to dispatch, dispatch, en-route, on-scene and hospital handover) prolonged in the COVID-19 period. Dispatches concerning mental health problems increased most in the study period (+1.2%, p < 0.001). Only eleven confirmed COVID-19 infections were encountered by EMS in the study period. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the present COVID-19 pandemic and social restrictions lead to changes in the EMS usage. These preliminary findings emphasize the importance of developing new strategies and protocols in response to the oncoming pandemic waves.","Laukkanen, Lauri; Lahtinen, Sanna; Liisanantti, Janne; Kaakinen, Timo; Ehrola, Ari; Raatiniemi, Lasse",Eur. j. public health,733,5

Much effort has focused on the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)-type compartment models. These models consider host populations and measure change of each compartment. In this study, we propose an alternative patch dynamic modeling framework from pathogens' perspective. Each patch, the basic module of this modeling framework, has four standard mechanisms of pathogen population size change: birth (replication), death, inflow, and outflow. This framework naturally distinguishes between-host transmission process (inflow and outflow) and within-host infection process (replication) during the entire transmission-infection cycle. We demonstrate that the SIR-type model is actually a special cross-sectional and discretized case of our patch dynamics model in pathogens' viewpoint. In addition, this patch dynamics modeling framework is also an agent-based model from hosts' perspective by incorporating individual host's specific traits. We provide an operational standard to formulate this modular-designed patch dynamics model. Model parameterization is feasible with a wide range of sources, including genomics data, surveillance data, electronic health record, and from other emerging technologies such as multiomics. We then provide two proof-of-concept case studies to tackle some of the existing challenges of SIR-type models: sexually transmitted disease and healthcare acquired infections. This patch dynamics modeling framework not only provides theoretical explanations to known phenomena, but also generates novel insights of disease dynamics from a more holistic viewpoint. It is also able to simulate and handle more complicated scenarios across biological scales such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Shi; Owolabi, Yakubu; Li, Ang; Lo, Eugenia; Robinson, Patrick; Janies, Daniel; Lee, Chihoon; Dulin, Michael",PLoS One,733,24

Currently, there are no known biomarkers, the determination of which before the onset of the disease would allow assessing the likelihood of its severe course. The purpose of this literature review was to analyze possible genetic factors characterizing the immune response to the new coronavirus infection that could be associated with the expression of angiotension-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and related proteins as predictors of severe Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We analyzed original articles published in Medline, PubMed and Scopus databases from December 2019 to November 2020. For searching articles, we used the following keywords: New coronavirus infection, Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19, severe course, complications, thrombosis, cytokine storm, ACE-2, biomarkers. In total, 3714 publications were selected using the keywords, of which 8 were in congruence with all the criteria. The literature analysis of the association of immunogenic characteristics and the expression of ACE-2 and related proteins with the development of severe COVID-19 revealed following genetic factors: HLA-B*46:01 genotype, CXCR6 gene hypoexpression, CCR9 gene expression, TLR7, rs150892504 mutations in the ERAP2 gene, overexpression of wild-type ACE-2, TMPRSS2 and its different polymorphisms. Genes, associated with the severe course, are more common among men. According to the analysis data, it can be assumed that there are population differences.

This paper describes specific scenarios of IPV reported by women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria to provide insight for policy and programmatic efforts. METHODS: This paper draws on seven de-identified case reports from organisations serving women experiencing IPV as well as media coverage of IPV cases in Nigeria, between April and May, 2020. RESULTS: In most cases, reports identified IPV that was occurring prior to the lockdown, but increased in severity or involved new types of violence during the lockdown. The case scenarios included descriptions of many forms of IPV commonly reported, including physical, economic, psychological and sexual violence, often concurrently. Several women also reported threats of being thrown out of their homes by perpetrators, which threatens women's ability to protect themselves from exposure to COVID-19, but could also leave women stranded with no access to transportation, social services, or other resources during the lockdown. Several women also reported IPV that involved custody of children, as well as IPV that disrupted women's income generation. IPV was also reported in relation to economic stressors associated with the lockdown. Reports highlight how the lockdown disrupted women's social support, hindering accessibility of formal and informal sources of help. CONCLUSION: The lockdowns in Nigeria may have inadvertently placed women already experiencing partner violence at risk for experiencing more severe violence, new challenges to cope with violent experiences, and other forms of violence, including violence that used the lockdown as a way to threaten women's security and ability to protect themselves from the virus. Hence, there is need for innovative approaches to support victims, with emphasis on ways in which perpetrators of IPV may be using the threat of COVID-19 to further gain power and control over partners.","Fawole, Olufunmilayo I; Okedare, Omowumi O; Reed, Elizabeth",BMC Womens Health,733,1

To date, little is known about the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on patients with bipolar disorder as a particularly vulnerable group.MethodsAn online survey was conducted in Austria at two points of measurement (T1 April 2020 during the first lockdown vs. T2 May 2020 at post-lockdown). The sample comprises 20 patients with bipolar disorder (mean age = 49.4 ± 15.6 years) and 20 healthy controls (mean age = 32.7 ± 9.6 years). A 2 × 2 factorial design to compare two time points (T1 vs. T2) and two groups (patients vs. healthy controls) was used. Main outcome measures included the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18) and a (non-validated and non-standardized) assessment to determine COVID-19 fears and emotional distress due to social distancing. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess the longitudinal association of COVID-19 fears/emotional distress due to social distancing during lockdown (T1) and psychological symptoms after lockdown (T2).ResultsAt T1, results demonstrated higher scores in BSI-18 subscales depression, anxiety and global severity index as well as emotional distress due to social distancing in bipolar patients compared to controls. There was a significant time x group interaction in the BSI-18 subscale somatization showing a decreasing trend in patients with BD compared to controls. No time effects in BSI-18 subscales or COVID-19 fears/emotional distress due to social distancing were observed. Regression analyses showed that COVID-19 fears during lockdown predicted somatization, only in patients.ConclusionsThere was a connection between the lockdown measures and somatization symptoms observed in patients. When the first steps of easing the social restrictions in May 2020 took place, somatization decreased only in the bipolar compared to the control group. Higher COVID-19 fears during lockdown predicted later symptoms at post-lockdown. Long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic need further investigations to improve current therapeutic approaches and prevent fears and distress during lockdown in individuals with bipolar disorder in times of crisis.","Dalkner, Nina Wagner-Skacel Jolana Ratzenhofer Michaela Fellendorf Frederike Lenger Melanie Maget Alexander Tmava-Berisha Adelina Pilz René Queissner Robert Hamm Carlo Bengesser Susanne Platzer Martina Birner Armin Reininghaus Eva",International Journal of Bipolar Disorders,733,3

The most striking manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 is atypical pneumonia and respiratory complications; however, various neurological manifestations are now well recognized. Currently, there have been very few case reports regarding COVID-19 in patients with a known history of myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis (MG) causes muscle weakness, especially respiratory muscles, in high-risk COVID-19 patients, which can lead to severe respiratory compromise. There are few reported cases of severe myasthenia crisis following COVID-19, likely due to the involvement of the respiratory apparatus and the use of immunosuppressive medication. We report the first case of ocular MG developing secondary to COVID-19 infection in a 65-year-old woman. Two weeks prior to hospitalization, the patient suffered from cough, fever, and diarrhea and was found to be positive for COVID-19 via a nasopharyngeal RT-PCR swab test. The electrodiagnostic test showed decremental response over more than 10% on repetitive nerve stimulation test of orbicularis oculi. She tested positive for antibodies against acetylcholine receptor. COVID-19 is known to cause the release of inflammatory cytokines, leading to immune-mediated damage.

In 2020 the above action plan announced initiatives along the entire life cycle of the product, with the aim to make sustainable products the norm in the EU. Therefore, it is anticipated that the above action will result in an increase in Europe's economic competitiveness, sustainability, resource efficiency and resource security. Within this context, the suitability of ferroalumina as a raw material in the blast furnace is investigated. Ferroalumina is the product of the high-pressure filter press dewatering process of the Greek red mud generated during the production of alumina by means of the Bayer cycle. Ferroalumina is a low-cost raw material and its possible charging in the blast furnace and/or steelmaking aggregates is a step towards industrial symbiosis, where the wastes, namely by-products, of an industry or an industrial process, become the raw materials for another. In the present work the effect of ferroalumina addition as a raw material was examined by smelting ferroalumina, blast furnace-slag, lime and scrap at 1550°C in a graphite crucible and a constant slag basicity. The increase of the alumina content in the slag improves the desulfurization capacity. Moreover, the silicon exchange between slag and metal was examined. The results indicate that the alkalis' capacity of the slag increases with the addition of ferroalumina. The analysis of the finally obtained slag suggests that it could be suitable for utilization in slag-cement production.","Karamoutsos, Spiros; Tzevelekou, Theofani; Christogerou, Angeliki; Grilla, Eleni; Gypakis, Antonios; Pérez Villarejo, Luis; Mantzavinos, Dionissios; Angelopoulos, George N",Waste Manag Res,733,26

This review examines how the position of population groups in vaccine priority lists varies between Federal guidance and State practice. METHODS: An online search of State vaccination prioritization plans was conducted. Data were extracted on each population group included and their relative position. A standardized ranking method was applied to provide a directional measure of variability in prioritization between State and Federal guidance, for each population group. RESULTS: Healthcare workers and those in long-term care facilities were largely prioritized in line with Federal guidance. Aside from early education staff, essential workers were often excluded at State level. Almost all States included the 65-74 year age group and most assigned them to a higher position than recommended in Federal guidance. Those with underlying medical conditions were similarly highly prioritized, although there was more variability across States. Some socially vulnerable groups (not included in Federal guidance) were highly prioritized by many States. CONCLUSIONS: The prioritization of groups for COVID-19 vaccination has been highly variable despite clear Federal guidance. Future guidance must be relevant to local needs, values, and constraints, to minimize any unwarranted heterogeneity in vaccine access across populations.","Jain, Vageesh; Schwarz, Lara; Lorgelly, Paula",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),733,22

Our state, Bihar reported its first confirmed case of covid on 22nd march 2020 at AIIMS Patna. For safety, Electives surgeries and outpatient department was suspended temporary since 25th March. Standard operating procedure (SOP) was framed for covid suspected, covid positive and negative patients. Neurosurgery department formulated their own strategy for successful and covid free management of neurosurgical patients along with zero transmission rate among doctors and staff. Methods: All Neurosurgical patients who got attended, admitted and operated from 25th March to 30th June 2020 (Period of lockdown) were taken in this study. Categorizations of the patients were done according to the urgency and elective nature of pathology after corona screening and RT-PCR testing of covid-19. A proper training to all neurosurgical staff and residents were given for management of patients (admission to operation to discharge). Results: Total 133 patients were attended and 90 were admitted. We operated 76 cases (major -52, minor - 24) during the lockdown period. Out of this 2 were corona positive (both eventually succumbed) and rest 74 was corona negative. One patient who was operated with corona negative report became positive after 10 days of surgery inward. All the residents, faculty and nursing staff remain asymptomatic throughout the lockdown period with zero infection rate and zero transmission rate . Conclusion: Following a properly made standard operating procedure and strictly implementing it can avoid any type of misadventure in neurosurgery during corona pandemic. Key message: Adequate planning and sufficient training is necessary to avoid any untoward incident of infection. Proper utilization of limited human resources and infectious kit is needed at this time.","Singh Saraj, K; Mishra Vishal, A; Jha Vikas, C",Interdiscip Neurosurg,733,30

The aim of this study was to measure the prevalence and severity of psychological distress in the community due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional survey was conducted in February and March 2020 in Tehran, Iran. We analyzed demographic characteristics and assessed depression, anxiety, and stress levels in 241 people using convenience sampling and the DASS-21 questionnaire. All statistical analyses were performed using R. Results The study population included 241 community-dwelling participants, of whom 145 were women and 96 were males. The mean age was 49.16 ± 8.01 years. Approximately two-thirds of participants (n = 158) reported no history of comorbid illness. The mean scores of depression and stress were at a ""severe"" level, while anxiety levels were at an ""extremely severe"" level. The prevalence of severe and extremely severe depression readings was 51.45 and 38.17%, respectively. In the anxiety subscale, the prevalence of severe and extremely severe depression was 95.90 and 4.1%, and in the stress subscale the prevalence was 48.97 and 4.98%, respectively. Conclusion In this study, people reported experiencing severe and extremely severe psychological distress. Therefore, there is an urgent need to implement mental health intervention policies to cope with this ongoing challenge. We suggest that the incorporation of molecular biomarker tests into the algorithm could aid in assessment of patients and guide the most appropriate therapeutic response.","Moayed, Malihe Sadat; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Mirmomeni, Golshan; Rahimi-Bashar, Farshid; Goharimoghadam, Keivan; Pourhoseingholi, Mohamad Amin; Abbasi-Farajzadeh, Mohsen; Babaei, Mansour; Sathyapalan, Thozhukat; Guest, Paul C; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Adv Exp Med Biol,733,33

Most child and adolescent psychiatry training programs have not integrated TMH into their curricula and are ill equipped to respond during crises to their patients' needs. In this study, we present the implementation of a home-based TMH (HB-TMH) service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We describe the technological, administrative, training, and clinical implementation components involved in transitioning a comprehensive outpatient child and adolescent psychiatry program to a HB-TMH virtual clinic. Results: The transition was accomplished in 6 weeks. Most in-clinic services were rapidly moved off campus to the home. Owing to challenges encountered with each implementation component, phone sessions bridged the transition from in-clinic to reliable virtual appointments. Within 3 weeks (March 20, 2020) of planning for HB-TMH, 67% of all appointments were conducted at home, and within 4 weeks (March 27, 2020), 90% were conducted at home. By week 6 (April 3, 2020), reliable HB-TMH appointments were implemented. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic crisis created the opportunity to innovate a solution to disrupted care for our established patients and to create a resource for youth who developed problems during the crisis. Our department was experienced in providing TMH services that facilitated the transition to HB-TMH, yet still had to overcome known and unanticipated challenges. Our experience provides a roadmap for establishing a HB-TMH service with focus on rapid implementation. It also demonstrates a role for TMH during (rather than after) future crises when usual community resources are not available.","Sharma, Aditi; Sasser, Tyler; Schoenfelder Gonzalez, Erin; Vander Stoep, Ann; Myers, Kathleen",J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol,733,29

DESIGN: retrospective cohort study with an individual level record linkage procedure of different administrative databases. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the cohort included 3,010 patients residing in FVG who tested positive for COVID-19 between 1 March and 15 May 2020, 2020. Regional hospital admissions and deaths without hospital admissions up to June 1st, 2020 were analysed. Determinants of the probability of a highly severe illness were investigated in terms of hospitalisations or death without hospital admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: COVID-19 patients were identified from regional epidemiological data warehouse. Demographical and clinical variables such as gender, age, patient's comorbidities, vaccinations, ARBs/sartans prescriptions, and geographical residence variables were collected by linking different databases. Descriptive analyses were performed. Logistic multivariate regressions were used to estimate the probability of hospitalisation or death, whichever came first. Model coefficients and odds ratios (OR) were reported. RESULTS: COVID-19 population in FVG had a mean age of 60 years and 59% were females. The study found that 37% had hypertension while patients with cardiologic diseases, diabetes, and cancer were around 15%; 22% of the cases were residing in retirement homes. Approximately 30% received flu or pneumococcal vaccination and a similar proportion of patients had at least one prescription of ARBs /sartans in the previous 6 months. Statistical models showed a higher probability of a worst course of disease for males, elderly, highly complicated (in terms of resource use) subjects, in the presence of cardiologic diseases, diabetes, and pneumococcal vaccination. People living in retirement homes had a lower probability of hospitalisation/death without hospital admission. The cohort was divided into two groups: COVID-19 patients infected in the territory and infected in retirement homes. Among COVID-19 patients infected in the territory, the probability of hospitalisation/death was higher for males, for older individuals, and for those with comorbidities. Diabetes resulted to be a risk factor (OR 1.79; 95%CI 1.23-2.62), as well as pneumococcal vaccination (OR 1.64; 95%CI: 1.18-2.29), which is a likely proxy of fragile patients with pulmonary disease. The flu vaccination showed a potential protective effect with a 40% lower probability of hospitalisation or death (OR 0.62; 95%CI 0.44-0.85). Among the retirement homes cohort group, a higher probability of a bad course of disease emerged for males and for more complex patients. CONCLUSIONS: the greatest risk of hospitalisation/death as a measure of more severe illness was confirmed for males, elderly, and for individuals with comorbidities. Flu vaccination seemed to have had a protective effect while pneumococcal vaccination likely identified a group of high-risk patients to be actively monitored. For patients infected in the territory, different hospitalisation strategies were implemented by the regional health districts.","Gobbato, Michele; Calagnan, Elena; Burba, Ivana; Rizzi, Laura; Grassetti, Luca; Del Zotto, Stefania; Dal Maso, Luigini; Serraiono, Diego; Tonutti, Giuseppe",Epidemiol Prev,733,1

However, viruses are able to evade the immune attack and proliferate and, in susceptible individuals, cause severe inflammatory response known as cytokine storm, particularly in the lungs. The advancement in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the host immune responses promises to facilitate the development of approaches for prevention or treatment of diseases. Components of immune system, such as antibodies, can also be used to develop sensitive and specific diagnostic methods as well as novel therapeutic agents.

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the use of a scoring system for standardized triage of elective CV procedures. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of patients scheduled for elective CV procedures that were prioritized ad hoc to be either performed or deferred when New Jersey state orders limited the performance of elective procedures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients in both groups were scored using our proposed CV medically necessary, time-sensitive (MeNTS) procedure scorecard, designed to stratify procedures based on a composite measure of hospital resource utilization, risk of COVID-19 exposure, and time sensitivity. RESULTS: A total of 109 scheduled elective procedures were either deferred (n = 58) or performed (n = 51). The median and mean cumulative CV MeNTS scores for the group of performed cases were significantly lower than for the deferred group (26 (interquartile range (IQR) 22-31) vs. 33 (IQR 28-39), p < .001, and 26.4 (SE 0.34) vs. 32.9 (SE 0.35), p < .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The CV MeNTS procedure score was able to stratify elective cases that were either performed or deferred using an ad hoc strategy. Our findings suggest that the CV MeNTS procedure scorecard may be useful for the fair triage of elective CV cases during the time when available capacity may be limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Waxman, Sergio; Garg, Aakash; Torre, Sabino; Wasty, Najam; Roelke, Marc; Cohen, Marc; Salemi, Arash",Catheter. cardiovasc. interv,733,16

It is unclear what measures have been taken by authorities in this setting to reduce the risk of infection, minimise stressors for refugees during the pandemic and communicate containment measures. OBJECTIVES: Assessment of measures that have been taken to prevent and contain SARS-CoV­2 in collective accommodation for refugees and identification of support required by authorities. METHODS: Qualitative interview study with 48 representatives responsible for the reception and accommodation of refugees. Individual interviews were transcribed verbatim and evaluated using framework analysis. RESULTS: We found substantial heterogeneity of measures taken to prevent infection, inform refugees, maintain social and health services, test for SARS-CoV­2 and quarantine positive cases. Effective intersectoral cooperation proved to be particularly important for coordination and implementation of measures. Need for support was expressed with regard to the improvement of infrastructure, opportunities to work with language interpreters and stronger involvement of local health experts. CONCLUSION: Amidst multiple actors and the complexity of structures and processes, the admission authorities have been taking on essential responsibilities related to infection control on an ad hoc basis, without being sufficiently positioned to do so. In order to further contain the pandemic, a strengthening of centralised, setting-specific recommendations and information as well as their translation through the pro-active involvement of the public health authorities at the local level are essential.","Biddle, Louise; Jahn, Rosa; Perplies, Clara; Gold, Andreas W; Rast, Eilin; Spura, Anke; Bozorgmehr, Kayvan",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,733,26

OBJECTIVES: To compare the prevalence and clinical characteristics of HE, and hand hygiene practices in HCWs working in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 units. METHODS: A total of 244 HCWs working in COVID-19 (n = 118) and non-COVID-19 patient care units (n = 126) were examined by dermatologists with regard to demographic parameters and hand hygiene practices. The COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups were matched at a 1:1 ratio according to age, atopy, and generalized dry skin. RESULTS: HE was more frequent in the COVID-19 group (48.3% vs 12.7%, P < .001), whereas working years (P < .05) and additional housework at home (P < .001) were longer in the non-COVID-19 group.

Stress experienced by nursing students is a common precursor of psychological distress and attrition. However, no scale is specifically used to evaluate the sources of stress experienced by nursing students in Mainland China. Aims and Objective. This study is aimed at testing and comparing the reliability and validity including sensitivity and specificity of two nursing students' stress instruments, the Chinese version of Student Nurse Stress Index Scale (SNSI-CHI), and the Stressors in Student Nursing Scale (SINS-CN) in Chinese nursing students, and describing the stress status of nursing students in China. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in two nursing schools in Henan Province from August 2017 to January 2018. Data were collected by using a questionnaire comprising the Chinese version of SNSI (SNSI-CHI), the Chinese version of SINS (SINS-CN), and the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS). Homogeneity and stability, content, construct and concurrent validity, and sensitivity and specificity were assessed. Results: The Cronbach's alpha (&#945;) of SNSI-CHI was 0.90, and the item-to-total correlations ranged from 0.35 to 0.66. The Cronbach's &#945; of SINS-CN was 0.93, and the item-to-total correlations ranged from 0.19 to 0.61. The findings of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) confirmed a good construct validity of SNSI-CHI and SINS-CN. The Pearson's rank correlation coefficients, between total scores of SNSI-CHI and CPSS and SINS-CN and CPSS, were assessed to 0.38 (P < 0.01) and 0.39 (P < 0.01), respectively. Regarding the CPSS, as the criterion, the cut-points of SNSI-CHI and SINS-CN for the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve were 0.77and 0.66, respectively. Conclusion: Both scales are valid and reliable for evaluating the source of stress of student nurses in China. Each has its own characteristics, but the SNSI-CHI demonstrated marginal advantage over the SINS-CN. The SNSI-CHI is short, is easily understood, and with clear dimension for the nursing students, and the SNSI-CHI is more acceptable for the users in China.","Zhu, Yiru; Liu, Yanjin; Guo, Lina; Jones, Martyn C; Guo, Yuanli; Yv, Suyuan; Guo, Yvru; Namassevayam, Genoosha; Wei, Miao",Biomed Res Int,733,20

However, thus far, it is not clear whether viral infection plays an important role in the etiology of nonresponding CAP and whether there is a significant difference in the clinical characteristics between viral and nonviral nonresponding CAP. Methods: From 2016 to 2019, nonresponding CAP patients were retrospectively enrolled in our study. All patients received bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and virus detection in BAL fluid by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data were collected. Results: A total of 43 patients were included. The median age was 62 years, and 65.1% of patients were male. Overall, 20 patients (46.5%) were identified with viral infection. Of these viruses, influenza virus (n = 8) and adenovirus (n = 7) were more frequently detected, and others included herpes simplex virus, human enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, human coronavirus 229E, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza virus. Compared with nonviral nonresponding CAP, only ground-glass opacity combined with consolidation was a more common imaging manifestation in viral nonresponding CAP. However, no obvious differences were found in clinical and laboratory findings between the presence and the absence of viral infections. Conclusions: Viral infections were particularly frequent in adults with nonresponding CAP. The ground-glass opacity combined with consolidation was a specific imaging manifestation for viral nonresponding CAP, while the clinical and laboratory data showed no obvious differences between viral and nonviral nonresponding CAP.","Zhang, Hao; Han, Yinling; Jin, Zhangchu; Ying, Yinghua; Lan, Fen; Huang, Huaqiong; Wang, Shaobin; Zhou, Hongwei; Zhang, Rong; Hua, Wen; Shen, Huahao; Li, Wen; Yan, Fugui",Can Respir J,733,16

As obligate intracellular pathogens, viruses use intracellular machineries and pathways for efficient replication in their host target cells. Interestingly, certain viruses, and, more especially, enveloped viruses belonging to different viral families and including human pathogens, can mediate cell-cell fusion between infected cells and neighboring non-infected cells. Depending of the cellular environment and tissue organization, this virus-mediated cell-cell fusion leads to the merge of membrane and cytoplasm contents and formation of multinucleated cells, also called syncytia, that can express high amount of viral antigens in tissues and organs of infected hosts. This ability of some viruses to trigger cell-cell fusion between infected cells as virus-donor cells and surrounding non-infected target cells is mainly related to virus-encoded fusion proteins, known as viral fusogens displaying high fusogenic properties, and expressed at the cell surface of the virus-donor cells. Virus-induced cell-cell fusion is then mediated by interactions of these viral fusion proteins with surface molecules or receptors involved in virus entry and expressed on neighboring non-infected cells. Thus, the goal of this review is to give an overview of the different animal virus families, with a more special focus on human pathogens, that can trigger cell-cell fusion.","Leroy, Héloïse; Han, Mingyu; Woottum, Marie; Bracq, Lucie; Bouchet, Jérôme; Xie, Maorong; Benichou, Serge",Int. j. mol. sci.

Increasing the temperature of the aqueous phase used to prepare the parent emulsion leads to an increase in average void and interconnect size in the resulting porous material. Additionally, the presence in the aqueous phase of small quantities of organic additives that are capable of partitioning between the two emulsion phases also affects the morphology of the porous material obtained. The additives examined were tetrahydrofuran (THF), methanol and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), all of which were found to increase the average void and interconnect diameters. It is suggested that THF and, to a lesser extent, PEG enhance Ostwald ripening, resulting in emulsion coarsening over time. Evidence for this was gleaned from NMR experiments to determine the rates of water diffusion in each emulsion. However, methanol was shown not to affect the rate of water diffusion. An alternative mechanism by which methanol could affect the emulsion stability is by depleting surfactant from the interface. However, higher levels of surfactant in emulsions containing methanol did not have a significant effect on morphology. To explain this, we suggest that methanol may result in depletion of surfactant from the emulsion interface, however additional surfactant serves not only to replace this depleted surfactant but also to increase the number of w/o micelles in the continuous phase. These facilitate transport of water between droplets, thus negating the effect of replacing the surfactant lost from the interface.","Carnachan, Ross J; Bokhari, Maria; Przyborski, Stefan A; Cameron, Neil R",Soft Matter,733,16

However, high costs for mono- or combination therapies, associated with adverse effects or possible development of resistance in some patients, warrant further development and modification to gain more flexibility for this immunotherapy approach. An attractive alternative to passive immunization with therapeutic antibodies might be active immunization with mimotopes (B-cell peptides) representing the mAbs' binding epitopes, to activate the patient's own anti-tumor immune response following immunization. Here, we identified and examined the feasibility of inducing anti-tumor effects in vivo following active immunization with a mimotope of the immune checkpoint programmed cell death 1 (PD1), alone or in combination with a Her-2/neu B-cell peptide vaccine. Overlapping peptides spanning the extracellular domains of human PD1 (hPD1) were used to identify hPD1-derived mimotopes, using the therapeutic mAb Nivolumab as a proof of concept. Additionally, for in vivo evaluation in a tumor mouse model, a mouse PD1 (mPD1)-derived mimotope was identified using an anti-mPD1 mAb with mPD1/mPDL-1 blocking capacity. The identified mimotopes were characterized by in vitro assays, including a reporter cell-based assay, and their anti-tumor effects were evaluated in a syngeneic tumor mouse model stably expressing human Her-2/neu. The identified PD1-derived mimotopes were shown to significantly block the mAbs' capacity in inhibiting the respective PD1/PD-L1 interactions. A significant reduction in tumor growth in vivo was observed following active immunization with the mPD1-derived mimotope, associated with a significant reduction in proliferation and increased apoptotic rates in the tumors. Particularly, combined vaccination with the mPD1-derived mimotope and a multiple B-cell epitope Her-2/neu vaccine potentiated the vaccine's anti-tumor effect. Our results suggest active immunization with mimotopes of immune checkpoint inhibitors either as monotherapy or as combination therapy with tumor-specific vaccines, as a new strategy for cancer treatment.","Tobias, Joshua; Battin, Claire; De Sousa Linhares, Annika; Lebens, Michael; Baier, Karin; Ambroz, Katharina; Drinic, Mirjana; Högler, Sandra; Inic-Kanada, Aleksandra; Garner-Spitzer, Erika; Preusser, Matthias; Kenner, Lukas; Kundi, Michael; Zielinski, Christoph C; Steinberger, Peter; Wiedermann, Ursula",Front Immunol,733,26

Previous studies related to carbendazim toxicity in fish have been limited to mortality patterns and degree of sensitivity across species. Literature on actual pathology in fish is scanty. The fish were exposed to a pre-determined sub-lethal concentration (1.4 mg/L) of Carbendazim for seven and fourteen days, 10 fish were sedated by cold shock, and sacrificed on days seven and 14. Another untreated group (control) were sacrificed at the same periods. The testes were harvested and weighed. Testicular actin microfilament, cytokeratin, desmin and vimentin intermediate filaments were determined using standard immunohistochemistry protocols. Variations in the intensity and pattern of immuno-expression of the testicular actin, cytokeratin, desmin and vimentin were significant in a phase dependent manner with day 14 being more pronounced. Immunohistochemical features of degenerated and necrotic germinal and Sertoli cells in the treated group, with loss of wire-mesh network which supported the mature germinal cells in the testicular lumen were also observed. A sub-lethal dose of carbendazim exposure for either seven or 14 days, induced deliterous changes in the testicular micro- and intermediate filaments, of the African catfish. This portends a reduction in the male reproductive potentials of the exposed species and resultant negative impact on production.","Aina, Oluwasanmi Olayinka; Ozegbe, Peter Chuka; Adeyemo, Olanike Kudirat",Niger J Physiol Sci,733,1

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the observed low incidence of perinatal infection could be related to a low expression of the membrane receptor for SARS-CoV2, ACE2, in the fetal-placental unit. We evaluated protein expression of ACE2 both in placentas and fetal organs from non-infected pregnancies across gestation. METHODS: Discovery study. Immunocytochemistry analysis for ACE2 in organs and placentas were performed in May 2020, in samples from a registered biobank. Five cases of medical termination of pregnancy performed at between 15 and 38 weeks' in healthy women. Paraffin-embedded tissues (kidneys, brain, lungs, intestinal tract, heart). Matching tissues from 8-year-old children (N=4) were tested as controls. Seven placentas including those of the 5 cases, 1 of a 7-week miscarriage and 1 of a symptomatic SARS-COV2 pregnancy at 34 weeks. Tissues' sections were incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-ACE2. Protein expression of ACE2 was detected by immunochemistry. RESULTS: ACE2 expression was detected in fetal kidneys, rectum and ileum across gestation and similarly in the pediatric control. It was barely detectable in lungs at 15 weeks' and not found thereafter. In the pediatric control, ACE2 was only detectable in type 2 pneumocytes. No ACE2 expression was found in the cerebral ependymal, parenchyma nor in cardiac tissues ACE2 was expressed in syncitiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast from 7th weeks' onwards and across gestation but not in the amnion. Similar intensity and distribution of ACE2 staining were identified in the mother's SARS-CoV2 placenta. CONCLUSIONS: Marked placental expression of ACE2 provides a rationale for vertical transmission at cellular level. Absence of ACE2 expression in the fetal brain and heart is reassuring on the risk of congenital malformation. Clinical follow-up of infected pregnant women and their children are needed to validate these observations. This article is protected by copyright.

The present research examined the relationships between well-being-satisfaction with life, negative affect, positive affect-and using actively or passively various SNSs-Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok-during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, two mediators were tested: social support and upward social comparison. One thousand four persons completed an online survey during the quarantine measures; the analyses employed structural equation modeling. Results showed that passive usage of Facebook is negatively related to well-being through upward social comparison, whereas active usage of Instagram is positively related to satisfaction with life and negative affect through social support. Furthermore, active usage of Twitter was positively related to satisfaction with life through social support; while passive usage was negatively related to upward social comparison, which, in turn, was associated with more negative affect. Finally, TikTok use was not associated with well-being. Results are discussed in line with SNSs' architectures and users' motivations.

We pose a series of questions focused around 5 topics, then offer a catalog of prior research to serve as points of departure for future research efforts. This compiled agenda offers guidance to scholars engaging in practitioner-informed research and provides risk communicators with a set of substantial research questions to guide future knowledge needs.","Sutton, Jeannette; Rivera, Yonaira; Sell, Tara Kirk; Moran, Meghan Bridgid; Bennett Gayle, DeeDee; Schoch-Spana, Monica; Stern, Eric K; Turetsky, David",Health Secur,733,24

They frequently consist of chlorine-based solutions, or in the direct input of a certain amount of chlorine in water supply systems and swimming pools. Colorimetry is one of the techniques used to measure the crucial persistence of chlorine in water, including household chlorine test kits commonly based on colorimetric indicators. Here, we show a simple and cheap colorimetric method based on 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), commonly used as chromogenic reagent for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. TMB is converted by chlorine to a colored molecule through a pH-dependent multi-step oxidation process where the chromaticity of TMB is directly proportional to chlorine content. This molecule offers several advantages over other commonly used reagents in terms of safety, sensitivity, and, peculiarly, hue modulation, giving rise to the detection of chlorine in water with a multi-color change of the indicator solution (transparent/blue/green/yellow). Moreover, through the appropriate setting of reaction conditions, such coloration is finely tunable to cover the range of chlorine concentration recommended by international health agencies for treatment of drinking water and swimming pools and to test homemade solutions prepared by dilution of household bleach during health emergency events such as during the current pandemic.

However, in relation to the COVID-19 virus, it appears that the naivete of the neonatal immune system has afforded some protection against the inflammatory response experienced by adolescents and adults. That said, COVID-19 and the associated changes in practice and policies implemented in response to the pandemic, has had an impact on the care of the baby during the perinatal and neonatal period. This article is the second in a two-part series focusing on important care issues relating to the newborn baby specifically, taken from an integrative review of current literature within the maternal and neonatal field. This paper analyses the emerging themes from selected literature to add to a developing body of knowledge;namely, physiological differences between the newborn baby and adult, neonatal management including, preterm labour and delivery, newborn resuscitation, investigations, care of the newborn, the importance of human milk and breastfeeding, and the implications of COVID-19 restrictions.

For initial-onset VKH disease, it is increasingly thought that corticosteroid therapy is not sufficient and additional non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapy is needed. At the 11th workshop on VKH, the disease was said to be well controlled with corticosteroids alone in Japanese patients. The aim of this study was to review the literature to determine whether different levels of severity exist in different geographical areas. METHODS: Literature was reviewed for studies on the evolution of initial-onset VKH disease, looking at treatment modalities and proportion of cases with chronic evolution and/or sunset-glow fundus (SGF). RESULTS: PubMed search yielded 1249 references containing the term of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada. Twenty references (15 from outside of Japan and 5 from Japan) contained information on the evolution of treated initial-onset disease. For the ""international"" group, percentage of chronic evolution after systemic corticosteroid monotherapy was 61%, and after combined steroidal and non-steroidal therapy it fell to 2% (0% in 3/4 studies). In the Japanese studies where all patients received systemic corticosteroids alone, chronic evolution was reported in 25%; however, SGF amounted to 61%. CONCLUSION: In the world at large, chronic evolution of initial-onset VKH disease treated with corticosteroids alone concerned two-thirds of patients. Japanese studies showed that chronic evolution was substantially less frequent, indicating possibly less severe disease in Japan. This proportion fell to almost zero when dual steroidal and non-steroidal immunosuppression was given at onset.","Herbort, Carl P; Tugal-Tutkun, Ilknur; Khairallah, Moncef; Abu El Asrar, Ahmed M; Pavésio, Carlos E; Soheilian, Masoud",Int. ophthalmol,733,16

Data suggesting a benefit to using ICIs in the neoadjuvant therapy of patients with early stage NSCLC are emerging. Eligible subjects were treatment naïve patients with stage IB, II, and resectable IIIA NSCLC. Patients received three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with four doses of avelumab every 2 weeks. Patients with squamous cell cancer received cisplatin or carboplatin on day 1 and gemcitabine on days 1 and 8 of each cycle of chemotherapy. Patients with nonsquamous histology received cisplatin or carboplatin with pemetrexed on day 1 of each cycle. Patients then proceeded to their planned surgery. Out of 15 patients accrued as part of stage 1 of the study, four had a radiologic response (1 complete response), lower than the minimum of six responses needed to continue to phase 2 of the study. The study was therefore terminated. Majority had adenocarcinoma histology and stage IIIA disease. The treatment was well tolerated with no unexpected side effects. Four patients (26.7%) had grade III/IV CTCAE toxicity. This study confirms that the preoperative administration of chemotherapy and avelumab is safe. There was no indication of increased surgical complications. The benefit of adding immunotherapy to chemotherapy did not appear to enhance the overall response rate of patients in the neoadjuvant setting in patients with resectable NSCLC because this study failed to meet its primary endpoint.","Tfayli, Arafat; Al Assaad, Majd; Fakhri, Ghina; Akel, Reem; Atwi, Hanine; Ghanem, Hady; El Karak, Fadi; Farhat, Fadi; Al Rabi, Kamal; Sfeir, Pierre; Youssef, Pierre; Mansour, Ziad; Assi, Hazem; Haidar, Mohamad; Abi Ghanem, Alain; Khalifeh, Ibrahim; Boulos, Fouad; Mahfouz, Ramy; Youssef, Bassem; Zeidan, Youssef; Bejjany, Rachelle; Khuri, Fadlo",Cancer med,733,13

OBJECTIVE: To examine pre-pandemic rates of and pandemic-related change in food insecurity among households with and without dietary restrictions. METHODS: A cross-sectional, panel-based survey of 3200 U.S. women was conducted in April 2020. Pre-pandemic food insecurity and early pandemic-related change in food insecurity were assessed using the adapted Hunger Vital Sign. Weighted, multivariate logistic regression was used to model the odds of pre-pandemic food insecurity and the odds of incident or worsening pandemic-related food insecurity among households with and without dietary restrictions. In models predicting pandemic-related outcomes, interaction effects between race/ethnicity and dietary restrictions were examined. RESULTS: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, households with self-reported food allergy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-1.9), celiac disease (aOR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.4-3.5), or both (aOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2-3.6) were significantly more likely to be food insecure than households without restrictions. Households with dietary restrictions were also significantly more likely to experience incident or worsening food insecurity during the early pandemic (food allergy: aOR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.3-2.1) (celiac disease: aOR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.5-3.5) (both: aOR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2-3.4). Race/ethnicity was not a significant moderator of the relationship between dietary restrictions and pandemic-related food insecurity. CONCLUSION: Households with dietary restrictions were more likely to experience both pre-pandemic and pandemic-related incident or worsening food insecurity than households without restrictions. Clinical care for patients with dietary restrictions requires attention to food insecurity.","Guillaume, Jessica D; Jagai, Jyotsna S; Makelarski, Jennifer A; Abramsohn, Emily M; Lindau, Stacy Tessler; Verma, Ritu; Ciaccio, Christina E",J.

Our click log dataset comprises approximately 5.2 million user interactions collected between 2013 and 2020. We use this dataset to create a standard IR evaluation benchmark -- TripClick -- with around 700,000 unique free-text queries and 1.3 million pairs of query-document relevance signals, whose relevance is estimated by two click-through models. As such, the collection is one of the few datasets offering the necessary data richness and scale to train neural IR models with a large amount of parameters, and notably the first in the health domain.

To expedite this process even further, human challenge trials have been proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an alternative to conventional approaches. In such trials, healthy volunteers are deliberately infected with the pathogen of interest, enabling scientists to study the infection process and facilitate further research on treatments or prophylactics, including vaccines. While human challenge trials would offer a collective benefit to society, minimizing the risks is always difficult. Ethical controversy thus inevitably surrounds these trials. Typically, healthy young adults are recruited to serve as the first candidate subjects for human challenge trials because they are generally considered to represent a low-risk population. Here, we present three reasons for doubt about this healthy-young-adults-first criterion and give justification for also recruiting healthy older adults (or not-young adults), meaning those over 30 years of age, to participate in such trials for SARS-CoV-2.","Matsui, Kenji; Inoue, Yusuke; Yamamoto, Keiichiro",Ethics Hum Res,733,20

In addition to fever, cough, headache, and shortness of breath, an intense increase in immune response-based inflammation has been the hallmark of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) virus infection. This narrative review summarizes and critiques pathophysiology of COVID-19 and its plausible effects on drug metabolism and disposition. The release of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukins, tumor necrosis factor &#945;), also known as 'cytokine storm', leads to altered molecular pathophysiology and eventually organ damage in the lung, heart, and liver. The laboratory values for various liver function tests (e.g., alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, albumin) have indicated potential hepatocellular injury in COVID-19 patients. Since the liver is the powerhouse of protein synthesis and the primary site of cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated drug metabolism, even a minor change in the liver function status has the potential to affect the hepatic clearance of xenobiotics. It has now been well established that extreme increases in cytokine levels are common in COVID-19 patients, and previous studies with patients infected with non-SARS-CoV-2 virus have shown that CYP enzymes can be suppressed by an infection-related cytokine increase and inflammation. Alongside the investigational COVID-19 drugs, the patients may also be on therapeutics for comorbidities; especially epidemiological studies have indicated that individuals with hypertension, hyperglycemia, and obesity are more vulnerable to COVID-19 than the average population. This complicates the drug-disease interaction profile of the patients as both the investigational drugs (e.g., remdesivir, dexamethasone) and the agents for comorbidities can be affected by compromised CYP-mediated hepatic metabolism. Overall, it is imperative that healthcare professionals pay attention to the COVID-19 and CYP-driven drug metabolism interactions with the goal to adjust the dose or discontinue the affected drugs as appropriate.","Deb, Subrata; Arrighi, Scott",Eur J Drug Metab Pharmacokinet,733,6

We aimed to review the public health interventions used during the COVID-19 outbreak and describe the impact on seasonal influenza activity in Korea. METHODS: National response strategies and public health interventions, along with daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in Korea were reviewed during the pandemic. National influenza surveillance data were compared between seven sequential seasons. Characteristics of each season, including the rate of influenza-like illness (ILI), duration of epidemic, date of termination of epidemic, distribution of influenza virus strain and hospitalization were analyzed. RESULTS: After various public health interventions including enforced public education on hand hygiene, cough etiquette and staying at home with respiratory symptoms, universal mask use in public places, refrain from non-essential social activities and school closure, the duration of the influenza epidemic in 2019/2020 decreased by 6-12 weeks and the influenza activity peak rated 49.8 ILI/1,000 visits compared to 71.9-86.2 ILI/1,000 visits of previous seasons. During the period of enforced social distancing from week 9 to 17 of 2020, influenza hospitalization cases were 11.9-26.9-fold lower compared with previous seasons. During the 2019/2020 season, influenza B accounted for only 4%, in contrast with previous seasons in which influenza B accounted for 26.6% to 54.9% of all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to activate high level national response not only led to a decrease in COVID-19, but also substantial decrease in seasonal influenza activity.

SRT is associated with high attrition rates when delivered in person in the clinic. SRT delivered via telehealth has the promise to address these concerns while improving both access to SRT and outcomes and promoting social distancing and reducing COVID exposure for high-risk stroke patients. Hypothesis: The High-Intensity Tele-speech Therapy for Stroke (HITTS) pilot program will result in measurable improvements in standardized performance and subjective reports in communication for participants compared to their baseline. Methods: We adapted evidence-based aphasia therapies implemented into a telehealth delivery model for four stroke survivor:care partner dyads over a six-week period. Following an initial face-toface evaluation, skilled SRT was delivered via telehealth for five hours per week. Standardized preand post-therapy assessments were completed as well as analyses of meeting therapy goals identified by the dyad as meaningful. Results: Participants completing HITTS showed significant clinical improvements in standardized assessment scores with all participants who completed the program. Three of the four dyads completed the HITTS program and without missing any sessions and completing more than 90% of assigned work. On average 85% of self-identified therapy goals were met by the end of HITTS. Conclusions: The HITTS pilot of delivering SRT via telehealth shows promise as a viable and potentially effective means of improving attrition and outcomes while increasing engagement of care partners. Telehealth delivery models have become increasingly more important during the COVID era. A larger scale study with a usual care comparator group and longer follow-up period is needed to see if these results can be replicated and whether gains are sustained beyond the intervention period.(Figure Presented).","Mehta, S.; Sico, J.

As proposed by the Self-Determination Theory, basic psychological needs are essential nutrients of well-being. The aim of this study was to examine the role of basic psychological needs in well-being during the pandemic. A sequential mediation model was examined, that links positive and negative affectivity to well-being (satisfaction with life and general distress) through satisfaction and frustration of the basic psychological needs (for autonomy, competence, and relatedness). The study involved 965 participants (M age = 29; 57% females) from Serbia. The Basic Psychological Needs Satisfaction and Frustration scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21, and The Serbian Inventory of Affect based on the Panas-X were used. All the tested models were statistically significant. Controlling for age, gender, having children, health, employment, and marital status, direct effects in all models were highly significant, explaining up to 59% of criteria variance. The proportion of the explained variance was even higher when accounting for indirect effects. Sequential mediation models revealed that the indirect relationships between positive and negative affectivity and satisfaction with life and general distress were serially mediated by autonomy satisfaction, competence frustration, relatedness satisfaction, and relatedness frustration. This study raised an important question on how the disposition to experience more positive or negative emotions affects the change in subjective well-being. These results, coherent with the Self-Determination Theory postulates, add to the understanding of human functioning in the times of extraordinary circumstances during a pandemic, by suggesting that satisfaction and frustration of basic psychological needs might have a key role in obtaining optimal well-being.","Sakan, Dusana; Zuljevic, Dragan; Rokvic, Nikola",Front Public Health,733,16

Here, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of published and purported SARS-CoV-2 antivirals including imatinib mesylate that we found to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication on Vero E6 cells and that, according to the published literature on other coronaviruses is likely to act on-target, as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. We identified a cluster of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals with characteristics of lysosomotropic agents, meaning that they are lipophilic weak bases capable of penetrating into cells. These agents include cepharentine, chloroquine, chlorpromazine, clemastine, cloperastine, emetine, hydroxychloroquine, haloperidol, ML240, PB28, ponatinib, siramesine, and zotatifin (eFT226) all of which are likely to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by non-specific (off-target) effects, meaning that they probably do not act on their 'official' pharmacological targets, but rather interfere with viral replication through non-specific effects on acidophilic organelles including autophagosomes, endosomes, and lysosomes. Imatinib mesylate did not fall into this cluster. In conclusion, we propose a tentative classification of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals into specific (on-target) versus non-specific (off-target) agents based on their physicochemical characteristics.","Sauvat, Allan; Ciccosanti, Fabiola; Colavita, Francesca; Di Rienzo, Martina; Castilletti, Concetta; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Kepp, Oliver; Zitvogel, Laurence; Fimia, Gian Maria; Piacentini, Mauro; Kroemer, Guido",Cell Death Dis,733,12

Despite the rapid growth of scientific publications about medical aspects of the pandemic, less has been explored about the effects of media communication regarding COVID-19 on healthy behaviors. Yet, the scientific literature has widely debated on how media can influence people's health-related evaluations, emotions, and behaviors. To fill this gap, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between media exposure, people's attitudes and emotions toward media contents, and healthy behaviors related to the use of public spaces, such as avoiding crowded places, wearing face masks, and maintaining social distance. A questionnaire referring to these variables was administered to an opportunistic sample of 174 participants in Italy during the off-peak period of the COVID-19 outbreak and before restrictions to mobility were extended to the whole country. Results showed that media exposure, the perception of social initiatives of prevention, and moderate levels of fear increase healthier behaviors in the use of public spaces. Perceiving alarming information did not significantly predict healthy behaviors in the use of public spaces. Results are discussed with reference to the previous literature. Suggestions to media communication to increase preventive behaviors during emergencies are also provided.","Scopelliti, Massimiliano; Pacilli, Maria Giuseppina; Aquino, Antonio",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),733,14

It examines the factors shaping the teachers’ self-efficacy and attitudes towards integrating computational modeling within inquiry-based learning modules for 9th grade physics. The learning modules introduce phenomena, the analysis of measurement data, and offer a method for coordinating the experimental findings with a theory-based computational model. Teachers’ attitudes and self-efficacy were studied using survey questions and workshop activity transcripts. As expected, prior experience in physics teaching was related to teachers’ self-efficacy in teaching physics in 9th grade. Also, teachers’ prior experience with programming was strongly related to their self-efficacy regarding the programming component of model construction. Surprisingly, the short interaction with computational modeling increased the group’s self-efficacy, and the average rating of understanding and enjoyment was similar among teachers with and without prior programming experience. Qualitative data provides additional insights into teachers’ predispositions towards the integration of computational modeling into the physics teaching.

England implemented a delayed lockdown on March 23, 2020, but Sweden did not. We aim to examine the effect of lockdown on daily COVID-19 cases and related deaths during the first 100 days post-lockdown. Methods: We compared daily cases of COVID-19 infection and related mortality in England and Sweden before and after lockdown intervention using a comparative-interrupted time series analysis. The period included was from COVID-19 pandemic onset till June 30, 2020. Results: The adjusted-rate of daily COVID-19 infections was eight cases/10,000,000 person higher in England than Sweden before lockdown order (95% CI: 2-14, P=0.01). On the day of intervention (lagged lockdown), England had 693 more COVID-19 cases/10,000,000 person compared to Sweden (95% CI: 467-920, P<0.001). Compared to the pre-intervention period, the adjusted daily confirmed cases rate decreased by 19 cases/ 10,000,000 person compared to Sweden (95% CI: 13-26, P<0.001). There was a rate excess of 1.5 daily deaths/ 10,000,000 person in England compared to Sweden pre-intervention (95% CI: 1-2, P<0.001). The increased mortality rate resulted in 50 excess deaths/ 10,000,000 person related to COVID-19 in England compared to Sweden on the day of lockdown (95% CI: 30-71, P<0.001). Post-intervention, the rate of daily deaths in England decreased by two deaths/ 10,000,000 person compared to Sweden (95% CI: 1-3, P<0.001). During phases one and two of lockdown lifting in England, there was no rebound increase in daily cases or deaths compared to Sweden. Conclusion: The lockdown order implemented in England on March 23, 2020, effectively decreased the daily new cases rate and related mortality compared to Sweden. There was no short-term increase in COVID-19 cases and related-deaths after the phases one and two of the lifting of restrictions in England compared to Sweden. This study provides empirical, comparative evidence that lockdowns slow the spread of COVID-19 in communities compared to herd immunity.","Ali, Moaath Mustafa; Samhouri, Yazan; Sabha, Marwa; Alnimer, Lynna",,733,17

The current situation of prevention and control is severe and urges guidance for clinicians, especially for medical systems. In the hope of providing a reference and recommendation for the prevention and control of the COVID-19, we carried out research to improve the quality of patient care and prevention during this epidemic. METHODS: All of the staff were trained rapidly to master personal protection in our department. We reviewed the patients’ discharged records who underwent surgery in our department during January 1 to March 1, 2019, and January 1 to March 1, 2020. The management of the surgery patients and flow charts were described and analyzed. Post-operation outcomes of the patients include duration, complications, surgical site infection (SSI), system infection, re-operation, and mortality. Both chi-squared test and Student’s t test were performed to determine the relationship between the two periods in terms of post-operation outcomes. RESULTS: Descriptive statistics analysis revealed that demographic of the patients between the two periods is similar. We had benefited from the strict flowcharts, smart robot, and protection equipment during the perioperative managements for orthopedic patients. With the help of the strict flow charts and smart equipment, post-operation outcomes of the patients revealed that the rates of the complications and re-operation had been reduced significantly (p < 0.05), while duration of operation, SSI, and system infection had no significant difference between two periods (p > 0.05). No patient and staff caught COVID-19 infection or mortality during the epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that medical quality and efficiency were affected little with the help of strategies described above during the epidemic, which could be a reference tool for medical staff in routine clinical practice for admission of patients around the world. What is more, the provided strategies, which may evolve over time, could be used as empirical guidance and reference for orthopedic peers to get through the pandemic and ensure the normal operation of the hospital.","Zeng, Hui; Li, Guoqing; Weng, Jian; Xiong, Ao; Xu, Chang; Yang, Yifei; Wang, Deli",J Orthop Surg Res,733,28

More recently development of novel strains of immunodeficient mice has begun to provide the opportunity to utilize small animal models for the study of many human-specific infectious agents. The introduction of a targeted mutation in the IL2 receptor common gamma chain gene (IL2rg(null)) in mice already deficient in T and B cells led to a breakthrough in the ability to engraft hematopoietic stem cells, as well as functional human lymphoid cells and tissues, effectively creating human immune systems in immunodeficient mice. These humanized mice are becoming increasingly important as pre-clinical models for the study of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and other human-specific infectious agents. However, there remain a number of opportunities to further improve humanized mouse models for the study of human-specific infectious agents. This is being done by the implementation of innovative technologies, which collectively will accelerate the development of new models of genetically modified mice, including; i) modifications of the host to reduce innate immunity, which impedes human cell engraftment; ii) genetic modification to provide human-specific growth factors and cytokines required for optimal human cell growth and function; iii) and new cell and tissue engraftment protocols.

AIM: To test the feasibility of using a set of free web-based services in digitization, preservation, and retrieval of prescription on a smartphone by primary care physicians. METHODS: This study was conducted with 12 primary care physicians. They were provided hands-on guides on creating an online form for uploading a prescription and using an application for retrieval of the prescription on a smartphone. Their feedback on the training material was collected by a telephonic survey, which had a 10-point Likert-type response option. Then, an in-depth interview was conducted to ascertain their perception on the tutorial and the process of digitization and retrieval system. RESULTS: All of the participants were able to create an online form on their smartphone. They uploaded their prescription and associated data and were able to retrieve it. The physicians opined positively on the “cost of the system,” “portability” on a smartphone and ease of the “tutorial”. They opined negatively on the “limited storage,” chances of “loss of data,” and “time constraints” for entry of the patients' data. CONCLUSION: Free web-based and smartphone applications can be used by a primary care physician for personal storage and retrieval of prescriptions.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the significance of occupational injuries in healthcare professionals was revealed once again. To assess the occupational injuries, we compared rates, distribution and type of exposure to blood and body fluids and NSSIs of health care workers for 2019 (pre-pandemic era) and 2020 (pandemic era) years, respectively. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our study included data collected by the ‘Hospital Infection Control Committee’ for the years 2019–2020. Data collected using the active surveillance method were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: During 2019 (pre-pandemic period) and 2020 (pandemic period), 112 (27.65%(0)) and 82 (21.4%(0)) NSSIs reported, respectively. Of the exposed HCWs in 2019 (pre-pandemic period), 16.8%(0) (14) were doctor, 53.6%(0) (60) were nurse and 47.4%(0) (14) were intern doctors. In the 2020 (pandemic period), NSSIs were observed most frequently in nurses and cleaning staff, 50.24%(0) and 33.64%(0), respectively. Concerning the total percentage of exposure to blood and other body fluids, a slight increase was revealed from 1.48%(0) to 2.62%(0) in 2019 and 2020, respectively.

METHODS: A 17‐item electronic survey was sent to 496 undergraduate dental students and 53 clinical faculty members who attended clinical sessions during the outbreak period. The survey explored various aspects related to primary sources and prevention of disease exposure, dental management of suspected cases, impact of COVID‐19 on students’ clinical performance and effects of suspension of educational activities on academic performance and clinical competence. RESULTS: The response rate of the students’ was 60.7% (n = 301). The majority of students reported that performing clinical work during the outbreak posed significant health concerns, resulted in a significant stress and negatively affected their clinical performance. The majority of students believed that aerosols generated during dental procedures are the major source for disease exposure and universal protective equipment is not effective for prevention. The decision to suspend teaching activities was supported by 89% of the students. Opinions were divided regarding the impact of the suspension on the academic performance and clinical competence. Educational videos were the most preferred form of distance education. The response rate of faculty members was 60.4% (n = 32). Responses of faculty members were similar to students, though fewer concerns were reported regarding the risk of disease transmission. All respondents agreed that extra‐precautionary measures are required to ensure optimum protection against disease exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The recent COVID‐19 outbreak has adversely affected various elements of dental education. High levels of major health risk perception were noted amongst students and educators. The interruption to academic and clinical activities may lead to an inevitable skill deficit within the new generation of dental graduates. Educators are under significant pressure to accommodate abrupt changes in teaching methods, find solutions to mitigate skill deficit and ensure safe clinical practice once clinical activities are resumed.","Jum’ah, Ahmad A.; Elsalem, Lina; Loch, Carolina; Schwass, Donald; Brunton, Paul A.",Eur J Dent Educ,733,8

Kawasaki Disease (KD) shares several clinical features with MIS-C, which prompted the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a mainstay therapy for KD. Both diseases share a robust activation of the innate immune system, including the IL-1 signaling pathway, and IL-1 blockade has been used for the treatment of both MIS-C and KD. The mechanism of action of IVIG in these two diseases and the cellular source of IL-1b have not been defined. METHODS: The effects of IVIG on peripheral blood leukocyte populations from patients with MIS-C and KD were examined using flow cytometry, mass cytometry (CyTOF), and live cell imaging. RESULTS: Circulating neutrophils were highly activated in patients with KD and MIS-C, and were a major source of IL-1ß. Following IVIG treatment, activated IL-1ß+ neutrophils were reduced in the circulation. In vitro, IVIG was a potent activator of neutrophil cell death via PI3-K and NADPH oxidase but independently of caspase activation.

The relatively small, 123 amino acid, N protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an arterivirus, presents an ideal model system for investigating the properties and mechanism of N protein nucleolar localization. The PRRSV N protein is found in both cytoplasmic and nucleolar compartments during infection and after transfection of gene constructs that express N-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion proteins. Experiments using oligopeptides, truncated polypeptides and amino acid-substituted proteins have identified several domains within PRRSV N protein that participate in nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, including a cryptic nuclear localization signal (NLS) called NLS-1, a functional NLS (NLS-2), a nucleolar localization sequence (NoLS), as well as a possible nuclear export signal (NES). The purpose of this paper is to review our current understanding of PRRSV N protein shuttling and propose a shuttling scheme regulated by RNA binding and post-translational modification.","Rowland, Raymond R.R.; Yoo, Dongwan",Virus Res,733,1

Here we reported on two patients with severe COVID-19 who experienced delirium in the early stage of recovery and mental illness including fatigue, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder in the post-illness stage of COVID-19. Two patients were admitted to hospital due to clinical symptoms and features of CT and were confirmed for COVID-19 by positive results of a throat swab for SARS-CoV-2. Due to severe respiratory symptoms and a low oxygenation index, they were transferred to the ICU and received invasive mechanical ventilation and sedation. Hyperactive delirium was observed after being transferred out of the ICU. Different treatment measures were taken in time. Delirium did not occur again in hospital, but they showed mental suffering, including fatigue, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), during the 5 month follow-up after discharge.","Han, Dong; Wang, Chenyang; Feng, Xiaojing; Wu, Jing",Front Med (Lausanne),733,16

This work made an early prediction of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China based on a simple mathematical model and limited epidemiological data. Combing characteristics of the historical epidemic, we found part of the released data is unreasonable. Through ruling out the unreasonable data, the model predictions exhibit that the number of the cumulative 2019-nCoV cases may reach 76,000 to 230,000, with a peak of the unrecovered infectives (22,000-74,000) occurring in late February to early March. After that, the infected cases will rapidly monotonically decrease until early May to late June, when the 2019-nCoV outbreak will fade out. Strong anti-epidemic measures may reduce the cumulative infected cases by 40%-49%.

Methods.The ChiCTR database was comprehensively searched, and the COVID-19 research registration information as of February 24, 2020 was counted. Descriptive analysis of registration time trends and geographical distribution. Chi-square test was used to compare the statistical differences between different study types, intervention methods, research phases and major sponsors. Frequency studies were used to analyze the characteristics of CMT and BI therapy. Results.232 COVID-19 studies registered at the ChiCTR Center were collected. The overall number of COVID-19 registrations was increased. Hubei Province, China has the largest number of registrations, followed by Guangdong, Zhejiang and Sichuan. There were significant differences between the number of participants (P=0.000), study duration (P=0.008), study assignment (P=0.000), and blind method (P=0.000) for different study types. Significant differences could be seen in the dimensions of multicenter study(P=0.022), of participants numbe(P=0.000), study duration(P=0.000) and study assignment(P=0.001) for the four intervention methods. There were significant differences in study assignment (P=0.043) between the early and late studies. CMT drugs with high research frequency are chloroquine, lopinavir / ritonavir, and I-IFN, which are all in phase 4; BI was Cell therapy, plasma therapy, Thymosin, and M/P-AB, which are all in early stages. Conclusion.There were problems of unclear classification of research types and irregular registration behavior. Also, within the studies researched, heterogeneity exists for various dimensions. Different research types, intervention methods, and research stages lead to significant differences in some dimensions of the COVID-19 study. Finally, statistical high-frequency research drugs can provide more treatment options and evidence-based evidence for the clinical practice.","song, gao; cheng, meng qun; wei, xian wen",,733,18

Patients with non-communicable diseases, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are vulnerable to this stress [4, 5]. Acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the most critical type of AMI, is associated with high mortality even with modern medicine [6–8]. Timely reperfusion therapy is critical for STEMI patients because a short ischemia time is associated with better clinical outcomes and lower acute and long -term mortality [9–12]. The COVID-19 pandemic placed the management of STEMI patients in a difficult situation due to the need to balance timely reperfusion therapy and maintaining strict infection control practices [13, 14]. Telemedicine, which is used to deliver health care services using information or communication technology, provides an opportunity to carry out the evaluation, diagnosis, and even monitor the patients after discharge when social distancing is needed [15]. In this article, we reported our preliminary experience with the usefulness of telemedicine in managing STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also provided a review of this topic.","Nan, Jing; Jia, Ruofei; Meng, Shuai; Jin, Yubo; Chen, Wei; Hu, Hongyu",J Med Syst,733,1

However, no experimental research has sought to intervene on this variable to develop a scalable response to the COVID-19 infodemic. OBJECTIVE Our study examined whether brief exposure to an infographic about the scientific process might increase trust in science and thereby affect belief in misinformation and intention to take preventive actions for COVID-19. METHODS This two-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial aimed to recruit a US representative sample of 1000 adults by age, race/ethnicity, and gender using the Prolific platform. Participants were randomly assigned to view either an intervention infographic about the scientific process or a control infographic. The intervention infographic was designed through a separate pilot study. Primary outcomes were trust in science, COVID-19 narrative belief profile, and COVID-19 preventive behavioral intentions. Twelve covariates were also collected and incorporated into all analyses. All outcomes were collected using web-based assessment. RESULTS From January 22 to 24, 2021, 1017 participants completed the study. The intervention slightly improved trust in science (difference-in-difference 0.03, SE=0.01, t=2.16, p=.031). No direct intervention effect was observed on belief profile membership, but there was some evidence of an indirect intervention effect mediated by trust in science (AOR=1.06, SE=0.03, 95%CI 1.00-1.12, z=2.01, p=.045) on membership in the 'scientific' profile compared to the others. No direct or indirect effects on preventive behaviors were observed. CONCLUSIONS Briefly viewing an infographic about science appeared to cause a small aggregate increase in trust in science, which may have, in turn, reduced the believability of COVID-19 misinformation. The effect sizes were small but commensurate with our 60-second, highly scalable intervention approach. Researchers should study the potential for truthful messaging about how science works to serve as misinformation inoculation, and test how best to do so.

In this perspective, we first discuss the understanding of the conformational switch of a protein towards the productive infections as a dark side of nature. Next, the unexplored binary combination of the sequences of SARS COV2 spike protein and the similarity with diverse pathogen derived proteins have been discussed to obtain novel molecular insights into the process of infection.","Sannigrahi, Achinta; De, Nayan; Chattopadhyay, Krishnananda",Commun Biol,733,16

While opening campuses could pose a major health risk, keeping instruction online could dissuade students from enrolling. Taking an ecological approach that considers the influence of state, county, and college characteristics, this study uses mixed modeling techniques and data from 89% of two- and four-year public and four-year private US colleges to assess the factors that shaped their decision to provide mostly in-person instruction as of August 1, 2020. We consider the roles of the political and religious climate, COVID-19 infections, deaths, and mask mandates, college niche, finances, dormitory capacity, faculty resistance, online readiness, and enrollment pressures. Most notably, we find that decision-making was unrelated to cumulative COVID infection and related mortality rates. The strongest predictor of in-person instruction was the proportion of state residents who voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential election. We also find that dormitory capacity, percentage of revenue from tuition, institutional importance to the local economy, graduation rates, and per capita endowment were associated with providing in-person instruction.","Felson, J.; Adamczyk, A.",,733,28
