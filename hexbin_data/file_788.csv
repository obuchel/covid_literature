35762,SAT Solving with Fragmented Hamiltonian Path Constraints for Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing,2020-06-26,"BACKGROUND: The human myxovirus resistance 2 (Mx2/MxB) protein was originally found to regulate cytoplasmic-nuclear transport but was recently reported to restrict HIV-1 replication by binding to HIV-1 capsid (CA), preventing uncoating, the nuclear import of pre-integration complex (PIC) and viral DNA integration. This work explores the mechanisms of MxB-mediated HIV-1 inhibition. RESULTS: We demonstrated that MxB represses NUP358-mediated PIC nuclear import and HIV-1 replication. Moreover, MxB’s effects on PIC nuclear import and HIV-1 replication depend critically on cofactor cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 6 (CPSF6). MxB binds nucleoporin NUP358, blocks NUP358-CA interaction, thereby impeding the nuclear import of HIV-1 PIC with CPSF6 binding to PIC. More intriguingly, CPSF6’s role in nuclear import depends on MxB, being a facilitator of HIV-1 nuclear import on its own, but becoming an inhibitor when MxB is present. CONCLUSIONS: Our work establishes that MxB impedes the NUP358-mediated HIV-1 nuclear import and viral replication cooperatively with CPSF6.","Xie, Linlin; Chen, Lang; Zhong, Chaojie; Yu, Ting; Ju, Zhao; Wang, Meirong; Xiong, Hairong; Zeng, Yan; Wang, Jianhua; Hu, Haitao; Hou, Wei; Feng, Yong",Retrovirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7322711/,788

Most prominently, in-person visits have fast-tracked to virtual visits. As we are forced to quickly adopt this new technology for our doctor-patient interactions, many questions remain in regard to structuring telemedicine visits for optimal outcomes. Little has been written on virtual evaluations of patients with spasticity. The intent of this article is to provide a framework for conducting a virtual spasticity assessment via telemedicine. We will provide tips on how to conduct a person-centered virtual examination assessment, and how to document goals related to the virtual assessment.","Verduzco-Gutierrez, Monica; Romanoski, Natasha L; Capizzi, Allison N; Reebye, Rajiv N; Jayawarden, Supun Kotteduwa; Ketchum, Nicholas C; O'Dell, Michael",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1097/phm.0000000000001594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32932356/,788

In Mexico, from 3 January 2020 to 9 January 2021, there have been 1439, 569 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 131,031 deaths. The World Health Organization reported that Mexico was ranked twelfth, in terms of confirmed cases of COVID-19 by country. Aim: the objective of this study was to determine what modifications dentists from the Mexican Republic have made to their dental practice during theCOVID-19 pandemic. Methods: the study was conducted based on a questionnaire to evaluate the dentists' response and knowledge on the modifications in their dental practice to combat the new coronavirus's cross-transmission. The questionnaire was piloted before it was distributed. The questionnaire was disseminated through the social network Facebook. The questionnaire was distributed to groups of dentists on Facebook, in each of the Mexican Republic states. The survey was carried out during June 2020. Results and Conclusions: from the 32 states of the Mexican Republic, 29 participated with at least one respondent. The results of the applied survey suggest that dentists, at least the population of surveyed ones, have proper knowledge of detection methods of patients suspected of COVID-19, preventive measures that must be applied in the dental office to decrease the risk of infection, and the appropriate procedures and solutions for dental office disinfection.","Casillas Santana, Miguel Ángel; Martínez Zumarán, Alan; Patiño Marín, Nuria; Castillo Silva, Brenda Eréndida; Sámano Valencia, Carolina; Salas Orozco, Marco Felipe",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,788

The related articles are taken from different search engines like PUBMED, google scholar, MeSH Core, Cochrane, BioRxiv, Semantic scholar and so on that were published during the time period of 2000 to till date. Using the five step process of the selection such as identification of clear objectives, identification of relevant articles, selection of data extraction and charting, analysis and the report was generated. The inclusion criteria for this article is related to molecular diagnostic methods to detect n-CoV and the relevant publications are also included. Articles citing the general information of CoV’s were excluded. Among many methods suggested, RT-PCR is considered as the best method to detect the covid positivity. Detection of virus by RT-PCR in clinical specimens offers the best option of diagnosis in the early stages of the disease and its application also includes genotyping and mutation detection. Limitation of the RT-PCR method is its low sensitivity during the first few days of disease with much better sensitivity in later stages of the illness. This review highlights the suitable molecular detection methods for the n-CoV disease by analyzing their sensitivity and specificity together with the advantages and its limitations.","Kameswari, S.; Smiline Girija, A.

METHODS: An electronic survey was sent to all medical residents in Qatar. Depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed by the DASS‐21. Professional quality of life was measured by the ProQOL scale. The coping mechanisms were assessed with the Brief‐COPE, and resilience was measured by the Brief Resilience Scale. RESULTS: The most commonly used coping strategies were acceptance, religion, and active coping. The avoidant coping style scores were higher among junior residents (p = .032) and non‐COVID‐19 frontliners (p = .039). Optimism LOT‐R score was higher in senior than in junior residents (p < .001). Lower avoidant coping scores, higher optimism, and higher resilience were associated with lower stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: It seems that avoidant coping styles can exacerbate depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms in medical residents amidst the COVID‐19 pandemic. Strategies promoting optimism, resilience, and approach coping styles can decrease the mental health burden of the pandemic on medical residents.","Smida, Malek; Khoodoruth, Mohamed Adil Shah; Al‐Nuaimi, Saleem Khaldoon; Al‐Salihy, Zerak; Ghaffar, Adeel; Khoodoruth, Widaad Nuzhah Chut‐kai; Mohammed, Mohammed Faisal Hamad; Ouanes, Sami",Brain Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34342152/; https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2320,788
