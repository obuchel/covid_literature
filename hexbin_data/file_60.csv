83,Neutralizing Antibody Fails to Impact the Course of Ebola Virus Infection in Monkeys,2007-01-19,"Prophylaxis with high doses of neutralizing antibody typically offers protection against challenge with viruses producing acute infections. In this study, we have investigated the ability of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody, KZ52, to protect against Ebola virus in rhesus macaques. This antibody was previously shown to fully protect guinea pigs from infection. Four rhesus macaques were given 50 mg/kg of neutralizing human monoclonal antibody KZ52 intravenously 1 d before challenge with 1,000 plaque-forming units of Ebola virus, followed by a second dose of 50 mg/kg antibody 4 d after challenge. A control animal was exposed to virus in the absence of antibody treatment. Passive transfer of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody not only failed to protect macaques against challenge with Ebola virus but also had a minimal effect on the explosive viral replication following infection. We show that the inability of antibody to impact infection was not due to neutralization escape. It appears that Ebola virus has a mechanism of infection propagation in vivo in macaques that is uniquely insensitive even to high concentrations of neutralizing antibody.","Oswald, Wendelien B; Geisbert, Thomas W; Davis, Kelly J; Geisbert, Joan B; Sullivan, Nancy J; Jahrling, Peter B; Parren, Paul W.

89,The Transmissibility of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Commercial Poultry in Industrialised Countries,2007-04-04,"BACKGROUND: With the increased occurrence of outbreaks of H5N1 worldwide there is concern that the virus could enter commercial poultry farms with severe economic consequences. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyse data from four recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in commercial poultry to estimate the farm-to-farm reproductive number for HPAI. The reproductive number is a key measure of the transmissibility of HPAI at the farm level because it can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures. In these outbreaks the mean farm-to-farm reproductive number prior to controls ranged from 1.1 to 2.4, with the maximum farm-based reproductive number in the range 2.2 to 3.2. Enhanced bio-security, movement restrictions and prompt isolation of the infected farms in all four outbreaks substantially reduced the reproductive number, but it remained close to the threshold value 1 necessary to ensure the disease will be eradicated. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that depending on the particular situation in which an outbreak of avian influenza occurs, current controls might not be enough to eradicate the disease, and therefore a close monitoring of the outbreak is required. The method we used for estimating the reproductive number is straightforward to implement and can be used in real-time. It therefore can be a useful tool to inform policy decisions.","Garske, Tini; Clarke, Paul; Ghani, Azra C.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1831494/,60
172,H5N1 and 1918 Pandemic Influenza Virus Infection Results in Early and Excessive Infiltration of Macrophages and Neutrophils in the Lungs of Mice,2008-08-01,"Fatal human respiratory disease associated with the 1918 pandemic influenza virus and potentially pandemic H5N1 viruses is characterized by severe lung pathology, including pulmonary edema and extensive inflammatory infiltrate. Here, we quantified the cellular immune response to infection in the mouse lung by flow cytometry and demonstrate that mice infected with highly pathogenic (HP) H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses exhibit significantly high numbers of macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs compared to mice infected with low pathogenic (LP) viruses. Mice infected with the 1918 pandemic virus and a recent H5N1 human isolate show considerable similarities in overall lung cellularity, lung immune cell sub-population composition and cellular immune temporal dynamics. Interestingly, while these similarities were observed, the HP H5N1 virus consistently elicited significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in whole lungs and primary human macrophages, revealing a potentially critical difference in the pathogenesis of H5N1 infections. These results together show that infection with HP influenza viruses such as H5N1 and the 1918 pandemic virus leads to a rapid cell recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils into the lungs, suggesting that these cells play a role in acute lung inflammation associated with HP influenza virus infection. In addition, primary macrophages and dendritic cells were also susceptible to 1918 and H5N1 influenza virus infection in vitro and in infected mouse lung tissue.","Perrone, Lucy A.; Plowden, Julie K.; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Katz, Jacqueline M.; Tumpey, Terrence M.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2483250/,60
195,Influenza A Virus Inhibits Type I IFN Signaling via NF-κB-Dependent Induction of SOCS-3 Expression,2008-11-07,"The type I interferon (IFN) system is a first line of defense against viral infections. Viruses have developed various mechanisms to counteract this response. So far, the interferon antagonistic activity of influenza A viruses was mainly observed on the level of IFNβ gene induction via action of the viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1). Here we present data indicating that influenza A viruses not only suppress IFNβ gene induction but also inhibit type I IFN signaling through a mechanism involving induction of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) protein. Our study was based on the observation that in cells that were infected with influenza A virus and subsequently stimulated with IFNα/β, phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 1 (STAT1) was strongly reduced. This impaired STAT1 activation was not due to the action of viral proteins but rather appeared to be induced by accumulation of viral 5′ triphosphate RNA in the cell. SOCS proteins are potent endogenous inhibitors of Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling. Closer examination revealed that SOCS-3 but not SOCS-1 mRNA levels increase in an RNA- and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)-dependent but type I IFN-independent manner early in the viral replication cycle. This direct viral induction of SOCS-3 mRNA and protein expression appears to be relevant for suppression of the antiviral response since in SOCS-3 deficient cells a sustained phosphorylation of STAT1 correlated with elevated expression of type I IFN-dependent genes. As a consequence, progeny virus titers were reduced in SOCS-3 deficient cells or in cells were SOCS-3 expression was knocked-down by siRNA. These data provide the first evidence that influenza A viruses suppress type I IFN signaling on the level of JAK/STAT activation. The inhibitory effect is at least in part due to the induction of SOCS-3 gene expression, which results in an impaired antiviral response.","Pauli, Eva-K.; Schmolke, Mirco; Wolff, Thorsten; Viemann, Dorothee; Roth, Johannes; Bode, Johannes G.; Ludwig, Stephan",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2572141/,60
202,Immune Mechanisms Responsible for Vaccination against and Clearance of Mucosal and Lymphatic Norovirus Infection,2008-12-12,"Two cardinal manifestations of viral immunity are efficient clearance of acute infection and the capacity to vaccinate against secondary viral exposure. For noroviruses, the contributions of T cells to viral clearance and vaccination have not been elucidated. We report here that both CD4 and CD8 T cells are required for efficient clearance of primary murine norovirus (MNV) infection from the intestine and intestinal lymph nodes. Further, long-lasting protective immunity was generated by oral live virus vaccination. Systemic vaccination with the MNV capsid protein also effectively protected against mucosal challenge, while vaccination with the capsid protein of the distantly related human Lordsdale virus provided partial protection. Fully effective vaccination required a broad immune response including CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and B cells, but the importance of specific immune cell types varied between the intestine and intestinal lymph nodes. Perforin, but not interferon gamma, was required for clearance of MNV infection by adoptively transferred T lymphocytes from vaccinated hosts. These studies prove the feasibility of both mucosal and systemic vaccination against mucosal norovirus infection, demonstrate tissue specificity of norovirus immune cells, and indicate that efficient vaccination strategies should induce potent CD4 and CD8 T cell responses.","Chachu, Karen A.; LoBue, Anna D.; Strong, David W.; Baric, Ralph S.; Virgin, Herbert W.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2587711/,60
237,Molecular Mechanisms of Recombination Restriction in the Envelope Gene of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus,2009-05-08,"The ability of pathogens to escape the host's immune response is crucial for the establishment of persistent infections and can influence virulence. Recombination has been observed to contribute to this process by generating novel genetic variants. Although distinctive recombination patterns have been described in many viral pathogens, little is known about the influence of biases in the recombination process itself relative to selective forces acting on newly formed recombinants. Understanding these influences is important for determining how recombination contributes to pathogen genome and proteome evolution. Most previous research on recombination-driven protein evolution has focused on relatively simple proteins, usually in the context of directed evolution experiments. Here, we study recombination in the envelope gene of HIV-1 between primary isolates belonging to subtypes that recombine naturally in the HIV/AIDS pandemic. By characterizing the early steps in the generation of recombinants, we provide novel insights into the evolutionary forces that shape recombination patterns within viral populations. Specifically, we show that the combined effects of mechanistic processes that determine the locations of recombination breakpoints across the HIV-1 envelope gene, and purifying selection acting against dysfunctional recombinants, can explain almost the entire distribution of breakpoints found within this gene in nature. These constraints account for the surprising paucity of recombination breakpoints found in infected individuals within this highly variable gene. Thus, the apparent randomness of HIV evolution via recombination may in fact be relatively more predictable than anticipated. In addition, the dominance of purifying selection in localized areas of the HIV genome defines regions where functional constraints on recombinants appear particularly strong, pointing to vulnerable aspects of HIV biology.","Simon-Loriere, Etienne; Galetto, Roman; Hamoudi, Meriem; Archer, John; Lefeuvre, Pierre; Martin, Darren P.; Robertson, David L.; Negroni, Matteo",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2671596/,60
321,Expression of the VP2 Protein of Murine Norovirus by a Translation Termination-Reinitiation Strategy,2009-12-22,"BACKGROUND: Expression of the minor virion structural protein VP2 of the calicivirus murine norovirus (MNV) is believed to occur by the unusual mechanism of termination codon-dependent reinitiation of translation. In this process, following translation of an upstream open reading frame (ORF) and termination at the stop codon, a proportion of 40S subunits remain associated with the mRNA and reinitiate at the AUG of a downstream ORF, which is typically in close proximity. Consistent with this, the VP2 start codon (AUG) of MNV overlaps the stop codon of the upstream VP1 ORF (UAA) in the pentanucleotide UAA UG. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we confirm that MNV VP2 expression is regulated by termination-reinitiation and define the mRNA sequence requirements. Efficient reintiation is dependent upon 43 nt of RNA immediately upstream of the UAA UG site. Chemical and enzymatic probing revealed that the RNA in this region is not highly structured and includes an essential stretch of bases complementary to 18S rRNA helix 26 (Motif 1). The relative position of Motif 1 with respect to the UAA UG site impacts upon the efficiency of the process. Termination-reinitiation in MNV was also found to be relatively insensitive to the initiation inhibitor edeine. CONCLUSIONS: The termination-reinitiation signal of MNV most closely resembles that of influenza BM2. Similar to other viruses that use this strategy, base-pairing between mRNA and rRNA is likely to play a role in tethering the 40S subunit to the mRNA following termination at the VP1 stop codon. Our data also indicate that accurate recognition of the VP2 ORF AUG is not a pre-requisite for efficient reinitiation of translation in this system.","Napthine, Sawsan; Lever, Robert A.; Powell, Michael L.; Jackson, Richard J.; Brown, T.

328,In Vitro Viability and Cytotoxicity Testing and Same-Well Multi-Parametric Combinations for High Throughput Screening,2009-06-11,"In vitro cytotoxicity testing has become an integral aspect of drug discovery because it is a convenient, costeffective, and predictive means of characterizing the toxic potential of new chemical entities. The early and routine implementation of this testing is testament to its prognostic importance for humans. Although a plethora of assay chemistries and methods exist for 96-well formats, few are practical and sufficiently sensitive enough for application in high throughput screening (HTS). Here we briefly describe a handful of the currently most robust and validated HTS assays for accurate and efficient assessment of cytotoxic risk. We also provide guidance for successful HTS implementation and discuss unique merits and detractions inherent in each method. Lastly, we discuss the advantages of combining specific HTS compatible assays into multi-parametric, same-well formats.","Niles, Andrew L.; Moravec, Richard A.; Riss, Terry L.",Curr Chem Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2802765/,60
342,IPS-1 Is Essential for the Control of West Nile Virus Infection and Immunity,2010-02-05,"The innate immune response is essential for controlling West Nile virus (WNV) infection but how this response is propagated and regulates adaptive immunity in vivo are not defined. Herein, we show that IPS-1, the central adaptor protein to RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling, is essential for triggering of innate immunity and for effective development and regulation of adaptive immunity against pathogenic WNV. IPS-1(−/−) mice exhibited increased susceptibility to WNV infection marked by enhanced viral replication and dissemination with early viral entry into the CNS. Infection of cultured bone-marrow (BM) derived dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages (Macs), and primary cortical neurons showed that the IPS-1-dependent RLR signaling was essential for triggering IFN defenses and controlling virus replication in these key target cells of infection. Intriguingly, infected IPS-1(−/−) mice displayed uncontrolled inflammation that included elevated systemic type I IFN, proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses, increased numbers of inflammatory DCs, enhanced humoral responses marked by complete loss of virus neutralization activity, and increased numbers of virus-specific CD8+ T cells and non-specific immune cell proliferation in the periphery and in the CNS. This uncontrolled inflammatory response was associated with a lack of regulatory T cell expansion that normally occurs during acute WNV infection. Thus, the enhanced inflammatory response in the absence of IPS-1 was coupled with a failure to protect against WNV infection. Our data define an innate/adaptive immune interface mediated through IPS-1-dependent RLR signaling that regulates the quantity, quality, and balance of the immune response to WNV infection.","Suthar, Mehul S.; Ma, Daphne Y.; Thomas, Sunil; Lund, Jennifer M.; Zhang, Nu; Daffis, Stephane; Rudensky, Alexander Y.; Bevan, Michael J.; Clark, Edward A.; Kaja, Murali-Krishna; Diamond, Michael S.; Gale, Michael",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2816698/,60
401,Caveolin-1 influences human influenza A virus (H1N1) multiplication in cell culture,2010-05-26,"BACKGROUND: The threat of recurring influenza pandemics caused by new viral strains and the occurrence of escape mutants necessitate the search for potent therapeutic targets. The dependence of viruses on cellular factors provides a weak-spot in the viral multiplication strategy and a means to interfere with viral multiplication. RESULTS: Using a motif-based search strategy for antiviral targets we identified caveolin-1 (Cav-1) as a putative cellular interaction partner of human influenza A viruses, including the pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1) strains of swine origin circulating from spring 2009 on. The influence of Cav-1 on human influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus replication was determined in inhibition and competition experiments. RNAi-mediated Cav-1 knock-down as well as transfection of a dominant-negative Cav-1 mutant results in a decrease in virus titre in infected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK), a cell line commonly used in basic influenza research as well as in virus vaccine production. To understand the molecular basis of the phenomenon we focussed on the putative caveolin-1 binding domain (CBD) located in the lumenal, juxtamembranal portion of the M2 matrix protein which has been identified in the motif-based search. Pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that caveolin-1 binds to M2. The data suggest, that Cav-1 modulates influenza virus A replication presumably based on M2/Cav-1 interaction. CONCLUSION: As Cav-1 is involved in the human influenza A virus life cycle, the multifunctional protein and its interaction with M2 protein of human influenza A viruses represent a promising starting point for the search for antiviral agents.","Sun, Lijing; Hemgård, Gun-Viol; Susanto, Sony A; Wirth, Manfred",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2889940/,60
404,Extrapulmonary tissue responses in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus,2010-04-07,"The mechanisms responsible for virulence of influenza viruses in humans remain poorly understood. A prevailing hypothesis is that the highly pathogenic virus isolates cause a severe cytokinemia precipitating acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) infected with a human highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus isolate (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) or reassortants of human influenza virus A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1) containing genes from the 1918 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus developed severe pneumonia within 24 h postinfection. However, virus spread beyond the lungs was only detected in the H5N1 group, and signs of extrapulmonary tissue reactions, including microglia activation and sustained up-regulation of inflammatory markers, most notably hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), were largely limited to this group. Extrapulmonary pathology may thus contribute to the morbidities induced by H5N1 viruses.","Tolnay, A.-E.; Baskin, C. R.; Tumpey, T. M.; Sabourin, P. J.; Sabourin, C. L.; Long, J. P.; Pyles, J.

454,Translation Elongation Factor 1A Facilitates the Assembly of the Tombusvirus Replicase and Stimulates Minus-Strand Synthesis,2010-11-04,"Replication of plus-strand RNA viruses depends on host factors that are recruited into viral replicase complexes. Previous studies showed that eukaryotic translation elongation factor (eEF1A) is one of the resident host proteins in the highly purified tombusvirus replicase complex. Using a random library of eEF1A mutants, we identified one mutant that decreased and three mutants that increased Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) replication in a yeast model host. Additional in vitro assays with whole cell extracts prepared from yeast strains expressing the eEF1A mutants demonstrated several functions for eEF1A in TBSV replication: facilitating the recruitment of the viral RNA template into the replicase complex; the assembly of the viral replicase complex; and enhancement of the minus-strand synthesis by promoting the initiation step. These roles for eEF1A are separate from its canonical role in host and viral protein translation, emphasizing critical functions for this abundant cellular protein during TBSV replication.","Li, Zhenghe; Pogany, Judit; Tupman, Steven; Esposito, Anthony M.; Kinzy, Terri Goss; Nagy, Peter D.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2973826/,60
609,B Cell Repertoire Analysis Identifies New Antigenic Domains on Glycoprotein B of Human Cytomegalovirus which Are Target of Neutralizing Antibodies,2011-08-11,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a herpesvirus, is a ubiquitously distributed pathogen that causes severe disease in immunosuppressed patients and infected newborns. Efforts are underway to prepare effective subunit vaccines and therapies including antiviral antibodies. However, current vaccine efforts are hampered by the lack of information on protective immune responses against HCMV. Characterizing the B-cell response in healthy infected individuals could aid in the design of optimal vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. To address this problem, we determined, for the first time, the B-cell repertoire against glycoprotein B (gB) of HCMV in different healthy HCMV seropositive individuals in an unbiased fashion. HCMV gB represents a dominant viral antigenic determinant for induction of neutralizing antibodies during infection and is also a component in several experimental HCMV vaccines currently being tested in humans. Our findings have revealed that the vast majority (>90%) of gB-specific antibodies secreted from B-cell clones do not have virus neutralizing activity. Most neutralizing antibodies were found to bind to epitopes not located within the previously characterized antigenic domains (AD) of gB. To map the target structures of these neutralizing antibodies, we generated a 3D model of HCMV gB and used it to identify surface exposed protein domains. Two protein domains were found to be targeted by the majority of neutralizing antibodies. Domain I, located between amino acids (aa) 133–343 of gB and domain II, a discontinuous domain, built from residues 121–132 and 344–438. Analysis of a larger panel of human sera from HCMV seropositive individuals revealed positivity rates of >50% against domain I and >90% against domain II, respectively. In accordance with previous nomenclature the domains were designated AD-4 (Dom II) and AD-5 (Dom I), respectively. Collectively, these data will contribute to optimal vaccine design and development of antibodies effective in passive immunization.","Pötzsch, Sonja; Spindler, Nadja; Wiegers, Anna-Katharina; Fisch, Tanja; Rücker, Pia; Sticht, Heinrich; Grieb, Nina; Baroti, Tina; Weisel, Florian; Stamminger, Thomas; Martin-Parras, Luis; Mach, Michael; Winkler, Thomas H.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3154849/,60
632,Virtual High-Throughput Screening Identifies Mycophenolic Acid as a Novel RNA Capping Inhibitor,2011-09-15,"The RNA guanylyltransferase (GTase) is involved in the synthesis of the (m7)Gppp-RNA cap structure found at the 5′ end of eukaryotic mRNAs. GTases are members of the covalent nucleotidyl transferase superfamily, which also includes DNA and RNA ligases. GTases catalyze a two-step reaction in which they initially utilize GTP as a substrate to form a covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate. The GMP moiety is then transferred to the diphosphate end of the RNA transcript in the second step of the reaction to form the Gppp-RNA structure. In the current study, we used a combination of virtual database screening, homology modeling, and biochemical assays to search for novel GTase inhibitors. Using this approach, we demonstrate that mycophenolic acid (MPA) can inhibit the GTase reaction by preventing the catalytic transfer of the GMP moiety onto an acceptor RNA. As such, MPA represents a novel type of inhibitor against RNA guanylyltransferases that inhibits the second step of the catalytic reaction. Moreover, we show that the addition of MPA to S. cerevisiae cells leads to a reduction of capped mRNAs. Finally, biochemical assays also demonstrate that MPA can inhibit DNA ligases through inhibition of the second step of the reaction. The biological implications of these findings for the MPA-mediated inhibition of members of the covalent nucleotidyl superfamily are discussed.","Tremblay-Létourneau, Maude; Despins, Simon; Bougie, Isabelle; Bisaillon, Martin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3174198/,60
687,Novel Inhibitor Design for Hemagglutinin against H1N1 Influenza Virus by Core Hopping Method,2011-11-30,"The worldwide spread of H1N1 avian influenza and the increasing reports about its resistance to the current drugs have made a high priority for developing new anti-influenza drugs. Owing to its unique function in assisting viruses to bind the cellular surface, a key step for them to subsequently penetrate into the infected cell, hemagglutinin (HA) has become one of the main targets for drug design against influenza virus. To develop potent HA inhibitors, the ZINC fragment database was searched for finding the optimal compound with the core hopping technique. As a result, the Neo6 compound was obtained. It has been shown through the subsequent molecular docking studies and molecular dynamic simulations that Neo6 not only assumes more favorable conformation at the binding pocket of HA but also has stronger binding interaction with its receptor. Accordingly, Neo6 may become a promising candidate for developing new and more powerful drugs for treating influenza. Or at the very least, the findings reported here may provide useful insights to stimulate new strategy in this area.","Li, Xiao-Bo; Wang, Shu-Qing; Xu, Wei-Ren; Wang, Run-Ling; Chou, Kuo-Chen",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3227604/,60
693,A Human Monoclonal Antibody with Neutralizing Activity against Highly Divergent Influenza Subtypes,2011-12-05,"The interest in broad-range anti-influenza A monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has recently been strengthened by the identification of anti-hemagglutinin (HA) mAbs endowed with heterosubtypic neutralizing activity to be used in the design of “universal” prophylactic or therapeutic tools. However, the majority of the single mAbs described to date do not bind and neutralize viral isolates belonging to highly divergent subtypes clustering into the two different HA-based influenza phylogenetic groups: the group 1 including, among others, subtypes H1, H2, H5 and H9 and the group 2 including, among others, H3 subtype. Here, we describe a human mAb, named PN-SIA28, capable of binding and neutralizing all tested isolates belonging to phylogenetic group 1, including H1N1, H2N2, H5N1 and H9N2 subtypes and several isolates belonging to group 2, including H3N2 isolates from the first period of the 1968 pandemic. Therefore, PN-SIA28 is capable of neutralizing isolates belonging to subtypes responsible of all the reported pandemics, as well as other subtypes with pandemic potential. The region recognized by PN-SIA28 has been identified on the stem region of HA and includes residues highly conserved among the different influenza subtypes. A deep characterization of PN-SIA28 features may represent a useful help in the improvement of available anti-influenza therapeutic strategies and can provide new tools for the development of universal vaccinal strategies.","Clementi, Nicola; De Marco, Donata; Mancini, Nicasio; Solforosi, Laura; Moreno, Guisella J.; Gubareva, Larisa V.; Mishin, Vasiliy; Di Pietro, Andrea; Vicenzi, Elisa; Siccardi, Antonio G.; Clementi, Massimo; Burioni, Roberto",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3230632/,60
720,Human Subtilase SKI-1/S1P Is a Master Regulator of the HCV Lifecycle and a Potential Host Cell Target for Developing Indirect-Acting Antiviral Agents,2012-01-05,"HCV infection is a major risk factor for liver cancer and liver transplantation worldwide. Overstimulation of host lipid metabolism in the liver by HCV-encoded proteins during viral infection creates a favorable environment for virus propagation and pathogenesis. In this study, we hypothesize that targeting cellular enzymes acting as master regulators of lipid homeostasis could represent a powerful approach to developing a novel class of broad-spectrum antivirals against infection associated with human Flaviviridae viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), whose assembly and pathogenesis depend on interaction with lipid droplets (LDs). One such master regulator of cholesterol metabolic pathways is the host subtilisin/kexin-isozyme-1 (SKI-1) – or site-1 protease (S1P). SKI-1/S1P plays a critical role in the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), which control expression of the key enzymes of cholesterol and fatty-acid biosynthesis. Here we report the development of a SKI-1/S1P-specific protein-based inhibitor and its application to blocking the SREBP signaling cascade. We demonstrate that SKI-1/S1P inhibition effectively blocks HCV from establishing infection in hepatoma cells. The inhibitory mechanism is associated with a dramatic reduction in the abundance of neutral lipids, LDs, and the LD marker: adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP)/perilipin 2. Reduction of LD formation inhibits virus assembly from infected cells. Importantly, we confirm that SKI-1/S1P is a key host factor for HCV infection by using a specific active, site-directed, small-molecule inhibitor of SKI-1/S1P: PF-429242. Our studies identify SKI-1/S1P as both a novel regulator of the HCV lifecycle and as a potential host-directed therapeutic target against HCV infection and liver steatosis. With identification of an increasing number of human viruses that use host LDs for infection, our results suggest that SKI-1/S1P inhibitors may allow development of novel broad-spectrum biopharmaceuticals that could lead to novel indirect-acting antiviral options with the current standard of care.","Olmstead, Andrea D.; Knecht, Wolfgang; Lazarov, Ina; Dixit, Surjit B.; Jean, François",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3252376/,60
754,Filovirus Tropism: Cellular Molecules for Viral Entry,2012-02-06,"In human and non-human primates, filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg viruses) cause severe hemorrhagic fever. Recently, other animals such as pigs and some species of fruit bats have also been shown to be susceptible to these viruses. While having a preference for some cell types such as hepatocytes, endothelial cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages, filoviruses are known to be pantropic in infection of primates. The envelope glycoprotein (GP) is responsible for both receptor binding and fusion of the virus envelope with the host cell membrane. It has been demonstrated that filovirus GP interacts with multiple molecules for entry into host cells, whereas none of the cellular molecules so far identified as a receptor/co-receptor fully explains filovirus tissue tropism and host range. Available data suggest that the mucin-like region (MLR) on GP plays an important role in attachment to the preferred target cells, whose infection is likely involved in filovirus pathogenesis, whereas the MLR is not essential for the fundamental function of the GP in viral entry into cells in vitro. Further studies elucidating the mechanisms of cellular entry of filoviruses may shed light on the development of strategies for prophylaxis and treatment of Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers.","Takada, Ayato",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3277274/,60
768,Influenza Virus Respiratory Infection and Transmission Following Ocular Inoculation in Ferrets,2012-03-01,"While influenza viruses are a common respiratory pathogen, sporadic reports of conjunctivitis following human infection demonstrates the ability of this virus to cause disease outside of the respiratory tract. The ocular surface represents both a potential site of virus replication and a portal of entry for establishment of a respiratory infection. However, the properties which govern ocular tropism of influenza viruses, the mechanisms of virus spread from ocular to respiratory tissue, and the potential differences in respiratory disease initiated from different exposure routes are poorly understood. Here, we established a ferret model of ocular inoculation to explore the development of virus pathogenicity and transmissibility following influenza virus exposure by the ocular route. We found that multiple subtypes of human and avian influenza viruses mounted a productive virus infection in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets following ocular inoculation, and were additionally detected in ocular tissue during the acute phase of infection. H5N1 viruses maintained their ability for systemic spread and lethal infection following inoculation by the ocular route. Replication-independent deposition of virus inoculum from ocular to respiratory tissue was limited to the nares and upper trachea, unlike traditional intranasal inoculation which results in virus deposition in both upper and lower respiratory tract tissues. Despite high titers of replicating transmissible seasonal viruses in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets inoculated by the ocular route, virus transmissibility to naïve contacts by respiratory droplets was reduced following ocular inoculation. These data improve our understanding of the mechanisms of virus spread following ocular exposure and highlight differences in the establishment of respiratory disease and virus transmissibility following use of different inoculation volumes and routes.","Belser, Jessica A.; Gustin, Kortney M.; Maines, Taronna R.; Pantin-Jackwood, Mary J.; Katz, Jacqueline M.; Tumpey, Terrence M.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3291616/,60
814,Discovery and Genomic Characterization of a Novel Bat Sapovirus with Unusual Genomic Features and Phylogenetic Position,2012-04-13,"Sapovirus is a genus of caliciviruses that are known to cause enteric disease in humans and animals. There is considerable genetic diversity among the sapoviruses, which are classified into different genogroups based on phylogenetic analysis of the full-length capsid protein sequence. While several mammalian species, including humans, pigs, minks, and dogs, have been identified as animal hosts for sapoviruses, there were no reports of sapoviruses in bats in spite of their biological diversity. In this report, we present the results of a targeted surveillance study in different bat species in Hong Kong. Five of the 321 specimens from the bat species, Hipposideros pomona, were found to be positive for sapoviruses by RT-PCR. Complete or nearly full-length genome sequences of approximately 7.7 kb in length were obtained for three strains, which showed similar organization of the genome compared to other sapoviruses. Interestingly, they possess many genomic features atypical of most sapoviruses, like high G+C content and minimal CpG suppression. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral proteins suggested that the bat sapovirus descended from an ancestral sapovirus lineage and is most closely related to the porcine sapoviruses. Codon usage analysis showed that the bat sapovirus genome has greater codon usage bias relative to other sapovirus genomes. In summary, we report the discovery and genomic characterization of the first bat calicivirus, which appears to have evolved under different conditions after early divergence from other sapovirus lineages.","Tse, Herman; Chan, Wan-Mui; Li, Kenneth S.

873,Prediction and Identification of T Cell Epitopes in the H5N1 Influenza Virus Nucleoprotein in Chicken,2012-06-20,"T cell epitopes can be used for the accurate monitoring of avian influenza virus (AIV) immune responses and the rational design of vaccines. No T cell epitopes have been previously identified in the H5N1 AIV virus nucleoprotein (NP) in chickens. For the first time, this study used homology modelling techniques to construct three-dimensional structures of the peptide-binding domains of chicken MHC class Ι molecules for four commonly encountered unique haplotypes, i.e., B4, B12, B15, and B19. H5N1 AIV NP was computationally parsed into octapeptides or nonapeptides according to the peptide-binding motifs of MHC class I molecules of the B4, B12, B15 and B19 haplotypes. Seventy-five peptide sequences were modelled and their MHC class I molecule-binding abilities were analysed by molecular docking. Twenty-five peptides (Ten for B4, six for B12, two for B15, and seven for B19) were predicted to be potential T cell epitopes in chicken. Nine of these peptides and one unrelated peptide were manually synthesized and their T cell responses were tested in vitro. Spleen lymphocytes were collected from SPF chickens that had been immunised with a NP-expression plasmid, pCAGGS-NP, and they were stimulated using the synthesized peptides. The secretion of chicken IFN-γ and the proliferation of CD8(+) T cells were tested using an ELISA kit and flow cytometry, respectively. The significant secretion of chicken IFN-γ and proliferation of CD8(+) T lymphocytes increased by 13.7% and 11.9% were monitored in cells stimulated with peptides NP(89–97) and NP(198–206), respectively. The results indicate that peptides NP(89–97) (PKKTGGPIY) and NP(198–206) (KRGINDRNF) are NP T cell epitopes in chicken of certain haplotypes. The method used in this investigation is applicable to predicting T cell epitopes for other antigens in chicken, while this study also extends our understanding of the mechanisms of the immune response to AIV in chicken.","Hou, Yanxia; Guo, Yingying; Wu, Chunyan; Shen, Nan; Jiang, Yongping; Wang, Jingfei",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3379973/,60
885,Proteasome-Dependent Disruption of the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Anaphase-Promoting Complex by HCMV Protein pUL21a,2012-07-05,"The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase which controls ubiquitination and degradation of multiple cell cycle regulatory proteins. During infection, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a widespread pathogen, not only phosphorylates the APC coactivator Cdh1 via the multifunctional viral kinase pUL97, it also promotes degradation of APC subunits via an unknown mechanism. Using a proteomics approach, we found that a recently identified HCMV protein, pUL21a, interacted with the APC. Importantly, we determined that expression of pUL21a was necessary and sufficient for proteasome-dependent degradation of APC subunits APC4 and APC5. This resulted in APC disruption and required pUL21a binding to the APC. We have identified the proline-arginine amino acid pair at residues 109–110 in pUL21a to be critical for its ability to bind and regulate the APC. A point mutant virus in which proline-arginine were mutated to alanines (PR-AA) grew at wild-type levels. However, a double mutant virus in which the viral ability to regulate the APC was abrogated by both PR-AA point mutation and UL97 deletion was markedly more attenuated compared to the UL97 deletion virus alone. This suggests that these mutations are synthetically lethal, and that HCMV exploits two viral factors to ensure successful disruption of the APC to overcome its restriction on virus infection. This study reveals the HCMV protein pUL21a as a novel APC regulator and uncovers a unique viral mechanism to subvert APC activity.","Fehr, Anthony R.; Gualberto, Nathaniel C.; Savaryn, John Paul; Terhune, Scott S.; Yu, Dong",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3390409/,60

Epidemic outbreaks have been occurring in Southeast Asia, with the most recent in 2010. Knowledge of the transmission route responsible for the HPAI outbreaks in these countries remains elusive. Our studies strongly suggested that field and laboratory studies focusing on mechanical transmission by blow flies should be considered to control H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks, in particular in epidemic areas, where there are high densities of different fly species throughout the year. In this paper, we review these field and laboratory entomological studies and discuss the possibility of blow flies transmitting H5N1 viruses.","Sawabe, Kyoko; Hoshino, Keita; Isawa, Haruhiko; Sasaki, Toshinori; Kim, Kyeong Soon; Hayashi, Toshihiko; Tsuda, Yoshio; Kurahashi, Hiromu; Kobayashi, Mutsuo",Influenza Res Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3447300/,60
964,Hepatitis C VLPs Delivered to Dendritic Cells by a TLR2 Targeting Lipopeptide Results in Enhanced Antibody and Cell-Mediated Responses,2012-10-16,"Although many studies provide strong evidence supporting the development of HCV virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccines, the fact that heterologous viral vectors and/or multiple dosing regimes are required to induce protective immunity indicates that it is necessary to improve their immunogenicity. In this study, we have evaluated the use of an anionic self-adjuvanting lipopeptide containing the TLR2 agonist Pam(2)Cys (E(8)Pam(2)Cys) to enhance the immunogenicity of VLPs containing the HCV structural proteins (core, E1 and E2) of genotype 1a. While co-formulation of this lipopeptide with VLPs only resulted in marginal improvements in dendritic cell (DC) uptake, its ability to concomitantly induce DC maturation at very small doses is a feature not observed using VLPs alone or in the presence of an aluminium hydroxide-based adjuvant (Alum). Dramatically improved VLP and E2-specific antibody responses were observed in VLP+E(8)Pam(2)Cys vaccinated mice where up to 3 doses of non-adjuvanted or traditionally alum-adjuvanted VLPs was required to match the antibody titres obtained with a single dose of VLPs formulated with this lipopeptide. This result also correlated with significantly higher numbers of specific antibody secreting cells that was detected in the spleens of VLP+E(8)Pam(2)Cys vaccinated mice and greater ability of sera from these mice to neutralise the binding and uptake of VLPs by Huh7 cells. Moreover, vaccination of HLA-A2 transgenic mice with this formulation also induced better VLP-specific IFN-γ-mediated responses compared to non-adjuvanted VLPs but comparable levels to that achieved when coadministered with complete freund’s adjuvant. These results suggest overall that the immunogenicity of HCV VLPs can be significantly improved by the addition of this novel adjuvant by targeting their delivery to DCs and could therefore constitute a viable vaccine strategy for the treatment of HCV.","Chua, Brendon Y.; Johnson, Douglas; Tan, Amabel; Earnest-Silveira, Linda; Sekiya, Toshiki; Chin, Ruth; Torresi, Joseph; Jackson, David C.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3472981/,60
973,The Evolutionary Pattern of Glycosylation Sites in Influenza Virus (H5N1) Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase,2012-11-01,"Two glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), on the surface of influenza viruses play crucial roles in transfaunation, membrane fusion and the release of progeny virions. To explore the distribution of N-glycosylation sites (glycosites) in these two glycoproteins, we collected and aligned the amino acid sequences of all the HA and NA subtypes. Two glycosites were located at HA0 cleavage sites and fusion peptides and were strikingly conserved in all HA subtypes, while the remaining glycosites were unique to their subtypes. Two to four conserved glycosites were found in the stalk domain of NA, but these are affected by the deletion of specific stalk domain sequences. Another highly conserved glycosite appeared at the top center of tetrameric global domain, while the others glycosites were distributed around the global domain. Here we present a detailed investigation of the distribution and the evolutionary pattern of the glycosites in the envelope glycoproteins of IVs, and further focus on the H5N1 virus and conclude that the glycosites in H5N1 have become more complicated in HA and less influential in NA in the last five years.","Chen, Wentian; Zhong, Yaogang; Qin, Yannan; Sun, Shisheng; Li, Zheng",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3486865/,60
1148,Abortive Lytic Reactivation of KSHV in CBF1/CSL Deficient Human B Cell Lines,2013-05-16,"Since Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) establishes a persistent infection in human B cells, B cells are a critical compartment for viral pathogenesis. RTA, the replication and transcription activator of KSHV, can either directly bind to DNA or use cellular DNA binding factors including CBF1/CSL as DNA adaptors. In addition, the viral factors LANA1 and vIRF4 are known to bind to CBF1/CSL and modulate RTA activity. To analyze the contribution of CBF1/CSL to reactivation in human B cells, we have successfully infected DG75 and DG75 CBF1/CSL knock-out cell lines with recombinant KSHV.219 and selected for viral maintenance by selective medium. Both lines maintained the virus irrespective of their CBF1/CSL status. Viral reactivation could be initiated in both B cell lines but viral genome replication was attenuated in CBF1/CSL deficient lines, which also failed to produce detectable levels of infectious virus. Induction of immediate early, early and late viral genes was impaired in CBF1/CSL deficient cells at multiple stages of the reactivation process but could be restored to wild-type levels by reintroduction of CBF1/CSL. To identify additional viral RTA target genes, which are directly controlled by CBF1/CSL, we analyzed promoters of a selected subset of viral genes. We show that the induction of the late viral genes ORF29a and ORF65 by RTA is strongly enhanced by CBF1/CSL. Orthologs of ORF29a in other herpesviruses are part of the terminase complex required for viral packaging. ORF65 encodes the small capsid protein essential for capsid shell assembly. Our study demonstrates for the first time that in human B cells viral replication can be initiated in the absence of CBF1/CSL but the reactivation process is severely attenuated at all stages and does not lead to virion production. Thus, CBF1/CSL acts as a global hub which is used by the virus to coordinate the lytic cascade.","Scholz, Barbara A.; Harth-Hertle, Marie L.; Malterer, Georg; Haas, Juergen; Ellwart, Joachim; Schulz, Thomas F.; Kempkes, Bettina",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3656114/,60
1191,Enterococcus faecalis FK-23 affects alveolar-capillary permeability to attenuate leukocyte influx in lung after influenza virus infection,2013-06-20,"Infection with influenza A virus, one of the most common life-threatening viruses, causes the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lung, which is directly correlated with influenza-associated morbidity and mortality. In this study, we investigated the potential of lysozyme-treated Enterococcus faecalis FK-23 (LFK) to prevent influenza in influenza virus-infected mice. C57BL/6N mice were orally administered LFK and intranasally infected with influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) at lethal doses. After infection with influenza A virus, the survival rate of the LFK-administered mice was significantly higher than that of saline-administered mice. Staining of lung sections with hematoxylin-eosin, and cell counts of lung and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed that oral administration of LFK suppressed the excessive infiltration of leukocytes into the lung after viral infection. Extravasation assay revealed that the arrest was mediated by modulation of pulmonary alveolar-capillary permeability. Expression levels of genes involved in matrix degradation, which are correlated with vascular permeability, were downregulated in LFK-administered mice. These findings suggest that stabilizing the integrity of the alveolar-capillary barrier by the administration of LFK improves survival rate.

FINDINGS: A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus was administered by intranasal instillation to groups of mice and ferrets, and animals developed typical clinical signs including body weight loss (mice and ferrets), ruffled fur (mice), sneezing (ferrets), and death (mice). Peak virus shedding from respiratory tract was observed on 2 days post inoculation (d.p.i.) for mice and 3–5 d.p.i. for ferrets. Virus could also be detected in brain, liver, spleen, kidney, and intestine from inoculated mice, and in heart, liver, and olfactory bulb from inoculated ferrets. The inoculation of H7N9 could elicit seroconversion titers up to 1280 in ferrets and 160 in mice.

1267,Mucosal Vaccination with Recombinant Adenovirus Encoding Nucleoprotein Provides Potent Protection against Influenza Virus Infection,2013-09-25,"Influenza vaccines that target the highly variable surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase cause inconvenience of having vaccination every year. For this reason, development of universal vaccines targeting conserved viral components is needed. In this study, we generated recombinant adenovirus (rAd) vaccine encoding nucleoprotein (NP) of A/PR/8/34 influenza virus, designated rAd/NP. BALB/c mice were immunized intranasally or sublingually with rAd/NP vaccine and subsequently challenged with lethal doses of heterologous as well as homologous influenza viruses. We found that intranasal immunization of rAd/NP elicited strong mucosal IgA responses as well as stronger CD8 T-cell responses toward immunodominant K(d)-restricted NP(147-155) epitope than sublingual immunization. Importantly, only single intranasal but not sublingual immunization of rAd/NP provides potent protection against both homologous and heterologous influenza virus challenges. These results suggest that recombinant rAd/NP could be a universal vaccine candidate for mucosal administration against influenza virus.","Kim, So-Hee; Kim, Joo Young; Choi, Youngjoo; Nguyen, Huan H.; Song, Man Ki; Chang, Jun",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3783479/,60
1273,APOBEC3G Polymorphism as a Selective Barrier to Cross-Species Transmission and Emergence of Pathogenic SIV and AIDS in a Primate Host,2013-10-03,"Cellular restriction factors, which render cells intrinsically resistant to viruses, potentially impose genetic barriers to cross-species transmission and emergence of viral pathogens in nature. One such factor is APOBEC3G. To overcome APOBEC3G-mediated restriction, many lentiviruses encode Vif, a protein that targets APOBEC3G for degradation. As with many restriction factor genes, primate APOBEC3G displays strong signatures of positive selection. This is interpreted as evidence that the primate APOBEC3G locus reflects a long-term evolutionary “arms-race” between retroviruses and their primate hosts. Here, we provide direct evidence that APOBEC3G has functioned as a barrier to cross-species transmission, selecting for viral resistance during emergence of the AIDS-causing pathogen SIVmac in captive colonies of Asian macaques in the 1970s. Specifically, we found that rhesus macaques have multiple, functionally distinct APOBEC3G alleles, and that emergence of SIVmac and simian AIDS required adaptation of the virus to evade APOBEC3G-mediated restriction. Our evidence includes the first comparative analysis of APOBEC3G polymorphism and function in both a reservoir and recipient host species (sooty mangabeys and rhesus macaques, respectively), and identification of adaptations unique to Vif proteins of the SIVmac lineage that specifically antagonize rhesus APOBEC3G alleles. By demonstrating that interspecies variation in a known restriction factor selected for viral counter-adaptations in the context of a documented case of cross-species transmission, our results lend strong support to the evolutionary “arms-race” hypothesis. Importantly, our study confirms that APOBEC3G divergence can be a critical determinant of interspecies transmission and emergence of primate lentiviruses, including viruses with the potential to infect and spread in human populations.","Krupp, Annabel; McCarthy, Kevin R.; Ooms, Marcel; Letko, Michael; Morgan, Jennifer S.; Simon, Viviana; Johnson, Welkin E.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3789815/,60
1288,Defective Viral Genomes Arising In Vivo Provide Critical Danger Signals for the Triggering of Lung Antiviral Immunity,2013-10-31,"The innate immune response to viruses is initiated when specialized cellular sensors recognize viral danger signals. Here we show that truncated forms of viral genomes that accumulate in infected cells potently trigger the sustained activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB and the production type I IFNs through a mechanism independent of IFN signaling. We demonstrate that these defective viral genomes (DVGs) are generated naturally during respiratory infections in vivo even in mice lacking the type I IFN receptor, and their appearance coincides with the production of cytokines during infections with Sendai virus (SeV) or influenza virus. Remarkably, the hallmark antiviral cytokine IFNβ is only expressed in lung epithelial cells containing DVGs, while cells within the lung that contain standard viral genomes alone do not express this cytokine. Together, our data indicate that DVGs generated during viral replication are a primary source of danger signals for the initiation of the host immune response to infection.","Tapia, Karla; Kim, Won-keun; Sun, Yan; Mercado-López, Xiomara; Dunay, Emily; Wise, Megan; Adu, Michael; López, Carolina B.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3814336/,60
1293,Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases 25 Negatively Regulates Virus-Induced Type I Interferon Signaling,2013-11-18,"Ubiquitination and deubiquitination have emerged as critical regulatory processes in the virus-triggered type I interferon (IFN) induction pathway. In this study, we carried out a targeted siRNA screen of 54 ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) and identified USP25 as a negative regulator of the virus-triggered type I IFN signaling pathway. Overexpression of USP25 inhibited virus-induced activation of IFN-β, interferon regulation factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), as well as the phosphorylation of IRF3 and NF-κB subunit p65. Furthermore, Knockdown of USP25 potentiated virus-induced induction of the IFN-β. In addition, detailed analysis demonstrated that USP25 cleaved lysine 48- and lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains in vitro and in vivo, and its deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) activity, were dependent on a cysteine residue (Cys178) and a histidine residue (His607). USP25 mutants lacking DUB activity lost the ability to block virus-induced type I IFN to some degree. Mechanistically, USP25 deubiquitinated retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), tumornecrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), and TRAF6 to inhibit RIG-I-like receptor-mediated IFN signaling. Our findings suggest that USP25 is a novel DUB negatively regulating virus-induced type I IFN production.","Zhong, Huijuan; Wang, Dang; Fang, Liurong; Zhang, Huan; Luo, Rui; Shang, Min; Ouyang, Chao; Ouyang, Haiping; Chen, Huanchun; Xiao, Shaobo",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3832446/,60

Acidic genital secretions of HIV-1-infected women contain HIV-1 likely coated by antibody. We found that the combination of acidic pH and Env-specific IgG, including that from cervicovaginal and seminal fluids of HIV-1-infected individuals, augmented transcytosis across epithelial cells as much as 20-fold compared with Env-specific IgG at neutral pH or non-specific IgG at either pH. Enhanced transcytosis was observed with clinical HIV-1 isolates, including transmitted/founder strains, and was eliminated in Fc neonatal receptor (FcRn)-knockdown epithelial cells. Non-neutralizing antibodies allowed similar or less transcytosis than neutralizing antibodies. However, the ratio of total:infectious virus was higher for neutralizing antibodies, indicating that they allowed transcytosis while blocking infectivity of transcytosed virus. Immunocytochemistry revealed abundant FcRn expression in columnar epithelia lining the human endocervix and penile urethra. Acidity and Env-specific IgG enhance transcytosis of virus across epithelial cells via FcRn and could facilitate translocation of virus to susceptible target cells following sexual exposure.","Gupta, Sandeep; Gach, Johannes S.; Becerra, Juan C.; Phan, Tran B.; Pudney, Jeffrey; Moldoveanu, Zina; Joseph, Sarah B.; Landucci, Gary; Supnet, Medalyn Jude; Ping, Li-Hua; Corti, Davide; Moldt, Brian; Hel, Zdenek; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Ruprecht, Ruth M.; Burton, Dennis R.; Mestecky, Jiri; Anderson, Deborah J.; Forthal, Donald N.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836734/,60
1302,The Soluble Form of the EIAV Receptor Encoded by an Alternative Splicing Variant Inhibits EIAV Infection of Target Cells,2013-11-22,"Equine lentivirus receptor 1 (ELR1) has been identified as the sole receptor for equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) and is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily. In addition to the previously described membrane-associated form of ELR1, two other major alternative splicing variant mRNAs were identified in equine monocyte-derived macrophages (eMDMs). One major spliced species (ELR1-IN) contained an insertion of 153 nt, which resulted in a premature stop codon situated 561 nt upstream of the predicted membrane spanning domain. The other major species (ELR1-DE) has a deletion of 109 nt that causes a shift of the open reading frame and generates a stop codon 312 nt downstream. Because ELR1-DE presumably encodes a peptide of a mere 23 residues, only ELR1-IN was further analyzed. The expression of a soluble form of ELR1 (sELR1) by ELR1-IN was confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. Similar to ELR1, the transcription level of ELR1-IN varied among individual horses and at different time points in the same individuals. The ratio of ELR1-IN mRNA species to ELR1 mRNA was approximately 1∶2.5. Pre-incubation of the recombinant sELR1 with EIAV significantly inhibited EIAV infection in equine macrophages, the primary in vivo target cell of the virus. Fetal equine dermal (FED) cells are susceptible to EIAV in vitro, and the replication of EIAV in FED cells transiently transfected with ELR1-IN was markedly reduced when compared with replication in cells transfected with the empty vector. Finally, the expression levels of both forms of the EIAV receptor were significantly regulated by infection with this virus. Taken together, our data indicate that sELR1 acts as a secreted cellular factor that inhibits EIAV infection in host cells.","Lin, Yue-Zhi; Yang, Fei; Zhang, Shu-Qin; Sun, Liu-Ke; Wang, Xue-Feng; Du, Cheng; Zhou, Jian-Hua",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3838338/,60

Its genome comprises a 12 kb single-strand positive-sense RNA. In the present study, we report the patterns of synonymous codon usage in 141 CHIKV genomes by calculating several codon usage indices and applying multivariate statistical methods. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis showed that the preferred synonymous codons were G/C and A-ended. A comparative analysis of RSCU between CHIKV and its hosts showed that codon usage patterns of CHIKV are a mixture of coincidence and antagonism. Similarity index analysis showed that the overall codon usage patterns of CHIKV have been strongly influenced by Pan troglodytes and Aedes albopictus during evolution. The overall codon usage bias was low in CHIKV genomes, as inferred from the analysis of effective number of codons (ENC) and codon adaptation index (CAI). Our data suggested that although mutation pressure dominates codon usage in CHIKV, patterns of codon usage in CHIKV are also under the influence of natural selection from its hosts and geography. To the best of our knowledge, this is first report describing codon usage analysis in CHIKV genomes. The findings from this study are expected to increase our understanding of factors involved in viral evolution, and fitness towards hosts and the environment.","Butt, Azeem Mehmood; Nasrullah, Izza; Tong, Yigang",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3942501/,60

An important cellular defense mechanism against HSV-1 infection is autophagy. The autophagic response of the host cell was suggested to be regulated by HSV-1. In this study, we performed a detailed analysis of autophagy in multiple HSV-1-targeted cell types, and under various infection conditions that recapitulate a productive infection model. We found that autophagy was slightly inhibited in one cell type, while in other cell types autophagy maintained its basal levels mostly unchanged during productive infection. This study refines the concept of HSV-1-mediated autophagy regulation to imply either inhibition, or prevention of activation, of the innate immune pathway.","Yakoub, Abraam M.; Shukla, Deepak",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4403807/,60
1802,A Neuron-Specific Antiviral Mechanism Prevents Lethal Flaviviral Infection of Mosquitoes,2015-04-27,"Mosquitoes are natural vectors for many etiologic agents of human viral diseases. Mosquito-borne flaviviruses can persistently infect the mosquito central nervous system without causing dramatic pathology or influencing the mosquito behavior and lifespan. The mechanism by which the mosquito nervous system resists flaviviral infection is still largely unknown. Here we report that an Aedes aegypti homologue of the neural factor Hikaru genki (AaHig) efficiently restricts flavivirus infection of the central nervous system. AaHig was predominantly expressed in the mosquito nervous system and localized to the plasma membrane of neural cells. Functional blockade of AaHig enhanced Dengue virus (DENV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), but not Sindbis virus (SINV), replication in mosquito heads and consequently caused neural apoptosis and a dramatic reduction in the mosquito lifespan. Consistently, delivery of recombinant AaHig to mosquitoes reduced viral infection. Furthermore, the membrane-localized AaHig directly interfaced with a highly conserved motif in the surface envelope proteins of DENV and JEV, and consequently interrupted endocytic viral entry into mosquito cells. Loss of either plasma membrane targeting or virion-binding ability rendered AaHig nonfunctional. Interestingly, Culex pipien pallens Hig also demonstrated a prominent anti-flavivirus activity, suggesting a functionally conserved function for Hig. Our results demonstrate that an evolutionarily conserved antiviral mechanism prevents lethal flaviviral infection of the central nervous system in mosquitoes, and thus may facilitate flaviviral transmission in nature.","Xiao, Xiaoping; Zhang, Rudian; Pang, Xiaojing; Liang, Guodong; Wang, Penghua; Cheng, Gong",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411065/,60
1914,Tropism and Induction of Cytokines in Human Embryonic-Stem Cells-Derived Neural Progenitors upon Inoculation with Highly- Pathogenic Avian H5N1 Influenza Virus,2015-08-14,"Central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction caused by neurovirulent influenza viruses is a dreaded complication of infection, and may play a role in some neurodegenerative conditions, such as Parkinson-like diseases and encephalitis lethargica. Although CNS infection by highly pathogenic H5N1 virus has been demonstrated, it is unknown whether H5N1 infects neural progenitor cells, nor whether such infection plays a role in the neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. To pursue this question, we infected human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) differentiated from human embryonic stem cells in vitro with H5N1 virus, and studied the resulting cytopathology, cytokine expression, and genes involved in the differentiation. Human embryonic stem cells (BG01) were maintained and differentiated into the neural progenitors, and then infected by H5N1 virus (A/Chicken/Thailand/CUK2/04) at a multiplicity of infection of 1. At 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-infection (hpi), cytopathic effects were observed. Then cells were characterized by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, supernatants quantified for virus titers, and sampled cells studied for candidate genes.The hNPCs were susceptible to H5N1 virus infection as determined by morphological observation and immunofluorescence. The infection was characterized by a significant up-regulation of TNF-α gene expression, while expressions of IFN-α2, IFN-β1, IFN-γ and IL-6 remained unchanged compared to mock-infected controls. Moreover, H5N1 infection did not appear to alter expression of neuronal and astrocytic markers of hNPCs, such as β-III tubulin and GFAP, respectively. The results indicate that hNPCs support H5N1 virus infection and may play a role in the neuroinflammation during acute viral encephalitis.","Pringproa, Kidsadagon; Rungsiwiwut, Ruttachuk; Tantilertcharoen, Rachod; Praphet, Reunkeaw; Pruksananonda, Kamthorn; Baumgärtner, Wolfgang; Thanawongnuwech, Roongroje",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4537284/,60
1955,High-Throughput Ligand Discovery Reveals a Sitewise Gradient of Diversity in Broadly Evolved Hydrophilic Fibronectin Domains,2015-09-18,"Discovering new binding function via a combinatorial library in small protein scaffolds requires balance between appropriate mutations to introduce favorable intermolecular interactions while maintaining intramolecular integrity. Sitewise constraints exist in a non-spatial gradient from diverse to conserved in evolved antibody repertoires; yet non-antibody scaffolds generally do not implement this strategy in combinatorial libraries. Despite the fact that biased amino acid distributions, typically elevated in tyrosine, serine, and glycine, have gained wider use in synthetic scaffolds, these distributions are still predominantly applied uniformly to diversified sites. While select sites in fibronectin domains and DARPins have shown benefit from sitewise designs, they have not been deeply evaluated. Inspired by this disparity between diversity distributions in natural libraries and synthetic scaffold libraries, we hypothesized that binders resulting from discovery and evolution would exhibit a non-spatial, sitewise gradient of amino acid diversity. To identify sitewise diversities consistent with efficient evolution in the context of a hydrophilic fibronectin domain, >10(5) binders to six targets were evolved and sequenced. Evolutionarily favorable amino acid distributions at 25 sites reveal Shannon entropies (range: 0.3–3.9; median: 2.1; standard deviation: 1.1) supporting the diversity gradient hypothesis. Sitewise constraints in evolved sequences are consistent with complementarity, stability, and consensus biases. Implementation of sitewise constrained diversity enables direct selection of nanomolar affinity binders validating an efficient strategy to balance inter- and intra-molecular interaction demands at each site.","Woldring, Daniel R.; Holec, Patrick V.; Zhou, Hong; Hackel, Benjamin J.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4575168/,60

Rapid emergence of drug resistance has led to an urgent need to develop new anti-influenza inhibitors. In this study we established a 293T cell line that constitutively synthesizes a virus-based negative strand RNA, which expresses Gaussia luciferase upon influenza A virus infection. Using this cell line, an assay was developed and optimized to search for inhibitors of influenza virus replication. Biochemical studies and statistical analyses presented herein demonstrate the sensitivity and reproducibility of the assay in a high-throughput format (Z′ factor value>0.8). A pilot screening provides further evidence for validation of the assay.

2026,Interferon-γ Inhibits Ebola Virus Infection,2015-11-12,"Ebola virus outbreaks, such as the 2014 Makona epidemic in West Africa, are episodic and deadly. Filovirus antivirals are currently not clinically available. Our findings suggest interferon gamma, an FDA-approved drug, may serve as a novel and effective prophylactic or treatment option. Using mouse-adapted Ebola virus, we found that murine interferon gamma administered 24 hours before or after infection robustly protects lethally-challenged mice and reduces morbidity and serum viral titers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that interferon gamma profoundly inhibits Ebola virus infection of macrophages, an early cellular target of infection. As early as six hours following in vitro infection, Ebola virus RNA levels in interferon gamma-treated macrophages were lower than in infected, untreated cells. Addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, to interferon gamma-treated macrophages did not further reduce viral RNA levels, suggesting that interferon gamma blocks life cycle events that require protein synthesis such as virus replication. Microarray studies with interferon gamma-treated human macrophages identified more than 160 interferon-stimulated genes. Ectopic expression of a select group of these genes inhibited Ebola virus infection. These studies provide new potential avenues for antiviral targeting as these genes that have not previously appreciated to inhibit negative strand RNA viruses and specifically Ebola virus infection. As treatment of interferon gamma robustly protects mice from lethal Ebola virus infection, we propose that interferon gamma should be further evaluated for its efficacy as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic strategy against filoviruses. Use of this FDA-approved drug could rapidly be deployed during future outbreaks.","Rhein, Bethany A.; Powers, Linda S.; Rogers, Kai; Anantpadma, Manu; Singh, Brajesh K.; Sakurai, Yasuteru; Bair, Thomas; Miller-Hunt, Catherine; Sinn, Patrick; Davey, Robert A.; Monick, Martha M.; Maury, Wendy",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4643030/,60

With the number of sequenced genomes reaching tens of thousands, both tree inference and detailed comparison with taxonomy are great challenges. We now provide one solution in the latest Release 3.0 of the alignment-free and whole-genome-based web server CVTree3. The server resides in a cluster of 64 cores and is equipped with an interactive, collapsible, and expandable tree display. It is capable of comparing the tree branching order with prokaryotic classification at all taxonomic ranks from domains down to species and strains. CVTree3 allows for inquiry by taxon names and trial on lineage modifications. In addition, it reports a summary of monophyletic and non-monophyletic taxa at all ranks as well as produces print-quality subtree figures. After giving an overview of retrospective verification of the CVTree approach, the power of the new server is described for the mega-classification of prokaryotes and determination of taxonomic placement of some newly-sequenced genomes. A few discrepancies between CVTree and 16S rRNA analyses are also summarized with regard to possible taxonomic revisions.

2152,The Myeloid LSECtin Is a DAP12-Coupled Receptor That Is Crucial for Inflammatory Response Induced by Ebola Virus Glycoprotein,2016-03-04,"Fatal Ebola virus infection is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response similar to septic shock. Ebola glycoprotein (GP) is involved in this process through activating dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. However, the mechanism is unclear. Here, we showed that LSECtin (also known as CLEC4G) plays an important role in GP-mediated inflammatory responses in human DCs. Anti-LSECtin mAb engagement induced TNF-α and IL-6 production in DCs, whereas silencing of LSECtin abrogated this effect. Intriguingly, as a pathogen-derived ligand, Ebola GP could trigger TNF-α and IL-6 release by DCs through LSECtin. Mechanistic investigations revealed that LSECtin initiated signaling via association with a 12-kDa DNAX-activating protein (DAP12) and induced Syk activation. Mutation of key tyrosines in the DAP12 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif abrogated LSECtin-mediated signaling. Furthermore, Syk inhibitors significantly reduced the GP-triggered cytokine production in DCs. Therefore, our results demonstrate that LSECtin is required for the GP-induced inflammatory response, providing new insights into the EBOV-mediated inflammatory response.","Zhao, Dianyuan; Han, Xintao; Zheng, Xuexing; Wang, Hualei; Yang, Zaopeng; Liu, Di; Han, Ke; Liu, Jing; Wang, Xiaowen; Yang, Wenting; Dong, Qingyang; Yang, Songtao; Xia, Xianzhu; Tang, Li; He, Fuchu",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4778874/,60
2163,"Dissection and integration of the autophagy signaling network initiated by bluetongue virus infection: crucial candidates ERK1/2, Akt and AMPK",2016-03-15,"Bluetongue virus (BTV), a complex double-stranded segmented RNA virus, has been found to initiate cellular autophagy for its own benefit. Here, with a view to understanding the underlying mechanisms, we first systematically dissected the exact signaling network in BTV-induced autophagy. We found that the activity of mTOR, a crucial pivot, was inhibited by BTV1 infection, subsequently leading to downstream p70S6K suppression and autophagy initiation. We then explored the upstream regulators of mTOR and analyzed their activities via a series of assays. We found BTV1-induced autophagy to be independent of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. However, the BTV1-induced inhibition of PI3K/Akt was found to be partially responsible for mTOR inactivation and subsequent autophagy initiation. Furthermore, we found unexpectedly that AMPK seemed to play a more important role in BTV1-induced autophagy. Elevated [Ca(2+)](cyto)-mediated activation of CaMKKβ exactly managed the activation of AMPK, which then positively regulated autophagy through suppressing mTOR. We must emphasize that TSC2 is a fatal mediator between upstream Akt or AMPK and downstream mTOR through its phosphorylation. Taken together, our data suggested that the BTV1-induced inhibition of the Akt-TSC2-mTOR pathway and the upregulation of the AMPK-TSC2-mTOR pathway both contributed to autophagy initiation and further favored virus replication.","Lv, Shuang; Xu, Qing-Yuan; Sun, En-Cheng; Zhang, Ji-Kai; Wu, Dong-Lai",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4791558/,60
2165,Molecular Evolution and Spatial Transmission of Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus Based on Complete Genome Sequences,2016-03-21,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) was a novel tick-borne bunyavirus that caused hemorrhagic fever with a high fatality rate in East Asia. In this study we analyzed the complete genome sequences of 122 SFTSV strains to determine the phylogeny, evolution and reassortment of the virus. We revealed that the evolutionary rate of three genome segments were different, with highest in the S segment and lowest in the L segment. The SFTSV strains were phylogenetically classified into 5 lineages (A, B, C, D and E) with each genome segment. SFTSV strains from China were classified in all 5 lineages, strains from South Korea were classified into 3 lineages (A, D, and E), and all strains from Japan were classified in only linage E. Using the average evolutionary rate of the three genome segments, we found that the extant SFTSV originated 20–87 years ago in the Dabie Mountain area in central China. The viruses were then transmitted to other areas of China, Japan and South Korea. We also found that six SFTSV strains were reassortants. Selection pressure analysis suggested that SFTSV was under purifying selection according to the four genes (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, glycoprotein, nucleocapsid protein, non-structural protein), and two sites (37, 1033) of glycoproteins were identified as being under strong positive selection. We concluded that SFTSV originated in central China and spread to other places recently and the virus was under purifying selection with high frequency of reassortment.","Liu, Jian-Wei; Zhao, Li; Luo, Li-Mei; Liu, Miao-Miao; Sun, Yue; Su, Xiang; Yu, Xue-jie",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4801363/,60
2199,The Proteolytic Activation of (H3N2) Influenza A Virus Hemagglutinin Is Facilitated by Different Type II Transmembrane Serine Proteases,2016-04-14,"Cleavage of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) by host cell proteases is necessary for viral activation and infectivity. In humans and mice, members of the type II transmembrane protease family (TTSP), e.g., TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and TMPRSS11d (HAT), have been shown to cleave influenza virus HA for viral activation and infectivity in vitro. Recently, we reported that inactivation of a single HA-activating protease gene, Tmprss2, in knockout mice inhibits the spread of H1N1 influenza viruses. However, after infection of Tmprss2 knockout mice with an H3N2 influenza virus, only a slight increase in survival was observed, and mice still lost body weight. In this study, we investigated an additional trypsin-like protease, TMPRSS4. Both TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 are expressed in the same cell types of the mouse lung. Deletion of Tmprss4 alone in knockout mice does not protect them from body weight loss and death upon infection with H3N2 influenza virus. In contrast, Tmprss2(−/−) Tmprss4(−/−) double-knockout mice showed a remarkably reduced virus spread and lung pathology, in addition to reduced body weight loss and mortality. Thus, our results identified TMPRSS4 as a second host cell protease that, in addition to TMPRSS2, is able to activate the HA of H3N2 influenza virus in vivo. IMPORTANCE Influenza epidemics and recurring pandemics are responsible for significant global morbidity and mortality. Due to high variability of the virus genome, resistance to available antiviral drugs is frequently observed, and new targets for treatment of influenza are needed. Host cell factors essential for processing of the virus hemagglutinin represent very suitable drug targets because the virus is dependent on these host factors for replication. We reported previously that Tmprss2-deficient mice are protected against H1N1 virus infections, but only marginal protection against H3N2 virus infections was observed. Here we show that deletion of two host protease genes, Tmprss2 and Tmprss4, strongly reduced viral spread as well as lung pathology and resulted in increased survival after H3N2 virus infection. Thus, TMPRSS4 represents another host cell factor that is involved in cleavage activation of H3N2 influenza viruses in vivo.","Kühn, Nora; Bergmann, Silke; Kösterke, Nadine; Lambertz, Ruth L.

However, progress in therapeutic antibody development was slow and intermittent until recently. The first antibody therapy, murine-derived murononab OKT3 for acute organ rejection, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1986, more than a decade after César Milstein and Georges Köhler developed methods for the isolation of mouse monoclonal antibodies from hybridoma cells in 1975. As a result of the scientific, technological, and clinical breakthroughs in the 1980s and 1990s, the pace of therapeutic antibody discovery and development accelerated. Antibodies are becoming a major drug modality with more than two dozen therapeutic antibodies in the clinic and hundreds more in development.

2278,Type I Interferon Receptor Deficiency in Dendritic Cells Facilitates Systemic Murine Norovirus Persistence Despite Enhanced Adaptive Immunity,2016-06-21,"In order for a virus to persist, there must be a balance between viral replication and immune clearance. It is commonly believed that adaptive immunity drives clearance of viral infections and, thus, dysfunction or viral evasion of adaptive immunity is required for a virus to persist. Type I interferons (IFNs) play pleiotropic roles in the antiviral response, including through innate control of viral replication. Murine norovirus (MNoV) replicates in dendritic cells (DCs) and type I IFN signaling in DCs is important for early control of MNoV replication. We show here that the non-persistent MNoV strain CW3 persists systemically when CD11c positive DCs are unable to respond to type I IFN. Persistence in this setting is associated with increased early viral titers, maintenance of DC numbers, increased expression of DC activation markers and an increase in CD8 T cell and antibody responses. Furthermore, CD8 T cell function is maintained during the persistent phase of infection and adaptive immune cells from persistently infected mice are functional when transferred to Rag1 (-/-) recipients. Finally, increased early replication and persistence are also observed in mixed bone marrow chimeras where only half of the CD11c positive DCs are unable to respond to type I IFN. These findings demonstrate that increased early viral replication due to a cell-intrinsic innate immune deficiency is sufficient for persistence and a functional adaptive immune response is not sufficient for viral clearance.","Nice, Timothy J.; Osborne, Lisa C.; Tomov, Vesselin T.; Artis, David; Wherry, E.

IAV possessing a monobasic cleavage site in the haemagglutinin (HA) protein replicates poorly in TMPRSS2 knockout mice owing to insufficient HA cleavage. In the present study, human isolates of influenza B virus (IBV) strains and a mouse-adapted IBV strain were analysed. The data showed that IBV successfully underwent HA cleavage in TMPRSS2 knockout mice, and that the mouse-adapted strain was fully pathogenic to these mice.

However, development, production and quality control of antibodies is expensive and time consuming. To circumvent these difficulties, three peptides were derived from complementarity determining regions of an antibody heavy chain against influenza A spike glycoprotein. Their binding properties were studied experimentally, and by molecular dynamics simulations. Two peptide candidates showed binding to influenza A/Aichi/2/68 H3N2. One of them, termed PeB, with the highest affinity prevented binding to and infection of target cells in the micromolar region without any cytotoxic effect. PeB matches best the conserved receptor binding site of hemagglutinin.

Early studies showed that a monovalent formalin-inactivated HRV vaccine can be protective, and virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb) correlated with protection. However, co-circulation of many HRV types discouraged further vaccine efforts. Here, we test the hypothesis that increasing virus input titres in polyvalent inactivated HRV vaccine may result in broad nAb responses. We show that serum nAb against many rhinovirus types can be induced by polyvalent, inactivated HRVs plus alhydrogel (alum) adjuvant. Using formulations up to 25-valent in mice and 50-valent in rhesus macaques, HRV vaccine immunogenicity was related to sufficient quantity of input antigens, and valency was not a major factor for potency or breadth of the response. Thus, we have generated a vaccine capable of inducing nAb responses to numerous and diverse HRV types.","Lee, Sujin; Nguyen, Minh Trang; Currier, Michael G.; Jenkins, Joe B.; Strobert, Elizabeth A.; Kajon, Adriana E.; Madan-Lala, Ranjna; Bochkov, Yury A.; Gern, James E.; Roy, Krishnendu; Lu, Xiaoyan; Erdman, Dean D.; Spearman, Paul; Moore, Martin L.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5036149/,60

Existing interferon-signaling/receptor-deficient mouse models may not be suitable for evaluating treatment effects of recombinant interferons. METHODS: We developed a novel mouse model for ZIKV infection by immunosuppressing BALB/c mice with dexamethasone. RESULTS: Dexamethasone-immunosuppressed male mice (6–8 weeks) developed disseminated infection as evidenced by the detection of ZIKV-NS1 protein expression and high viral loads in multiple organs. They had ≥ 10% weight loss and high clinical scores soon after dexamethasone withdrawal (10 dpi), which warranted euthanasia at 12 dpi. Viral loads in blood and most tissues at 5 dpi were significantly higher than those at 12 dpi (P < 0.05). Histological examination revealed prominent inflammatory infiltrates in multiple organs, and CD45 + and CD8 + inflammatory cells were seen in the testis. These findings suggested that clinical deterioration occurred during viral clearance by host immune response. Type I interferon treatments improved clinical outcome of mice (100% vs 0% survival). CONCLUSIONS: Besides virus dissemination, inflammation of various tissues, especially orchitis, may be potential complications of ZIKV infection with significant implications on disease transmission and male fertility. Interferon treatment should be considered in patients at high risks for ZIKV-associated complications when the potential benefits outweigh the side effects of treatment.","Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Chan, Chris Chung-Sing; Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan; Mak, Winger Wing-Nga; Zhu, Houshun; Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man; Tee, Kah-Meng; Zhu, Zheng; Cai, Jian-Piao; Tsang, Jessica Oi-Ling; Chik, Kenn Ka-Heng; Yin, Feifei; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Kok, Kin-Hang; Jin, Dong-Yan; Au-Yeung, Rex Kwok-Him; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",EBioMedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5161441/,60

Most vaccination protocols adapt two or three doses to induce long-term lasting immunity. Our previous study showed that the naked DNA encoding the triple-antigen fusion TFP846 (Rv3615c-Mtb10.4-Rv2660c) induced robust T cellular immune responses accompanying four inoculations against mycobacteria infection. However, a number of compliance issues exist in some areas lacking the appropriate medical infrastructure with multiple administrations. In this study, a novel vesicular stomatitis virus expressing TFP846 (VSV-846) was developed and the immune responses elicited by VSV-846 were evaluated. We observed that intranasal delivery of VSV-846 induced a potent antigen-specific T cell response following a single dose and VSV-846 efficiently controlled bacterial growth to levels ~10-fold lower than that observed in the mock group 6 weeks post-infection in BCG-infected mice. Importantly, mice immunized with VSV-846 provided long-term protection against mycobacteria infection compared with those receiving p846 or BCG immunization. Increased memory T cells were also observed in the spleens of VSV-846-vaccinated mice, which could be a potential mechanism associated with long-term protective immune response.

2841,Characterization of Monoclonal Antibodies against HA Protein of H1N1 Swine Influenza Virus and Protective Efficacy against H1 Viruses in Mice,2017-08-08,"H1N1 swine influenza viruses (SIV) are prevalent in pigs globally, and occasionally emerge in humans, which raises concern about their pandemic threats. To stimulate hemagglutination (HA) of A/Swine/Guangdong/LM/2004 (H1N1) (SW/GD/04) antibody response, eukaryotic expression plasmid pCI-neo-HA was constructed and used as an immunogen to prepare monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Five mAbs (designed 8C4, 8C6, 9D6, 8A4, and 8B1) against HA protein were obtained and characterized. Western blot showed that the 70 kDa HA protein could be detected by all mAbs in MDCK cells infected with SW/GD/04. Three mAbs—8C4, 8C6, and 9D6—have hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neutralization test (NT) activities, and 8C6 induces the highest HI and NT titers. The protection efficacy of 8C6 was investigated in BALB/c mice challenged with homologous or heterologous strains of the H1 subtype SIV. The results indicate that mAb 8C6 protected the mice from viral infections, especially the homologous strain, which was clearly demonstrated by the body weight changes and reduction of viral load. Thus, our findings document for the first time that mAb 8C6 might be of potential therapeutic value for H1 subtype SIV infection.","Liu, Yun; Li, Hongtao; Xue, Yujia; Zhao, Shuang; Li, Chenxi; Qu, Liandong; Zhang, Yun; Liu, Ming",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5580466/,60
2888,Screening of FDA-Approved Drugs for Inhibitors of Japanese Encephalitis Virus Infection,2017-10-13,"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), an arthropod-borne flavivirus, is a major cause of acute viral encephalitis in humans. No approved drug is available for the specific treatment of JEV infections, and the available vaccines are not effective against all clinical JEV isolates. In the study described here, a high-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library for inhibitors of JEV was performed. Five hit drugs that inhibited JEV infection with a selective index of >10 were identified. The antiviral activities of these five hit drugs against other flavivirus, including Zika virus, were also validated. As three of the five hit drugs were calcium inhibitors, additional types of calcium inhibitors that confirmed that calcium is essential for JEV infection, most likely during viral replication, were utilized. Adaptive mutant analysis uncovered that replacement of Q130, located in transmembrane domain 3 of the nonstructural NS4B protein, which is relatively conserved in flaviviruses, with R or K conferred JEV resistance to manidipine, a voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (VGCC) inhibitor, without an apparent loss of the viral growth profile. Furthermore, manidipine was indicated to protect mice against JEV-induced lethality by decreasing the viral load in the brain, while it abrogated the histopathological changes associated with JEV infection. This study provides five antiflavivirus candidates and identifies cytoplasmic calcium to be a novel antiviral target for the treatment of JEV infection. The findings reported here provide therapeutic possibilities for combating infections caused by flaviviruses. IMPORTANCE No approved therapy for the treatment of Japanese encephalitis virus infection is currently available. Repurposing of approved drugs would accelerate the development of a therapeutic stratagem. In this study, we screened a library of FDA-approved drugs and identified five hit drugs, especially calcium inhibitors, exerting antiflavivirus activity that blocked viral replication. The in vivo efficacy and toxicity of manidipine were investigated with a mouse model of JEV infection, and the viral target was identified by generating an adaptive mutant.","Wang, Shaobo; Liu, Yang; Guo, Jiao; Wang, Peilin; Zhang, Leike; Xiao, Gengfu; Wang, Wei",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5640845/,60
2997,GM-CSF overexpression after influenza a virus infection prevents mortality and moderates M1-like airway monocyte/macrophage polarization,2018-01-05,"BACKGROUND: Influenza A viruses cause life-threatening pneumonia and lung injury in the lower respiratory tract. Application of high GM-CSF levels prior to infection has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality from pathogenic influenza infection in mice, but the mechanisms of protection and treatment efficacy have not been established. METHODS: Mice were infected intranasally with influenza A virus (PR8 strain). Supra-physiologic levels of GM-CSF were induced in the airways using the double transgenic GM-CSF (DTGM) or littermate control mice starting on 3 days post-infection (dpi). Assessment of respiratory mechanical parameters was performed using the flexiVent rodent ventilator. RNA sequence analysis was performed on FACS-sorted airway macrophage subsets at 8 dpi. RESULTS: Supra-physiologic levels of GM-CSF conferred a survival benefit, arrested the deterioration of lung mechanics, and reduced the abundance of protein exudates in bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid to near baseline levels. Transcriptome analysis, and subsequent validation ELISA assays, revealed that excess GM-CSF re-directs macrophages from an “M1-like” to a more “M2-like” activation state as revealed by alterations in the ratios of CXCL9 and CCL17 in BAL fluid, respectively. Ingenuity pathway analysis predicted that GM-CSF surplus during IAV infection elicits expression of anti-inflammatory mediators and moderates M1 macrophage pro-inflammatory signaling by Type II interferon (IFN-γ). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that application of high levels of GM-CSF in the lung after influenza A virus infection alters pathogenic “M1-like” macrophage inflammation. These results indicate a possible therapeutic strategy for respiratory virus-associated pneumonia and acute lung injury.

3034,Characterization of Influenza Virus Pseudotyped with Ebolavirus Glycoprotein,2018-01-30,"We have produced a new Ebola virus pseudotype, E-S-FLU, that can be handled in biosafety level 1/2 containment for laboratory analysis. The E-S-FLU virus is a single-cycle influenza virus coated with Ebolavirus glycoprotein, and it encodes enhanced green fluorescence protein as a reporter that replaces the influenza virus hemagglutinin. MDCK-SIAT1 cells were transduced to express Ebolavirus glycoprotein as a stable transmembrane protein for E-S-FLU virus production. Infection of cells with the E-S-FLU virus was dependent on the Niemann-Pick C1 protein, which is the well-characterized receptor for Ebola virus entry at the late endosome/lysosome membrane. The E-S-FLU virus was neutralized specifically by an anti-Ebolavirus glycoprotein antibody and a variety of small drug molecules that are known to inhibit the entry of wild-type Ebola virus. To demonstrate the application of this new Ebola virus pseudotype, we show that a single laboratory batch was sufficient to screen a library (LOPAC(1280); Sigma) of 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds for inhibition of virus entry. A total of 215 compounds inhibited E-S-FLU virus infection, while only 22 inhibited the control H5-S-FLU virus coated in H5 hemagglutinin. These inhibitory compounds have very dispersed targets and mechanisms of action, e.g., calcium channel blockers, estrogen receptor antagonists, antihistamines, serotonin uptake inhibitors, etc., and this correlates with inhibitor screening results obtained with other pseudotypes or wild-type Ebola virus in the literature. The E-S-FLU virus is a new tool for Ebola virus cell entry studies and is easily applied to high-throughput screening assays for small-molecule inhibitors or antibodies. IMPORTANCE Ebola virus is in the Filoviridae family and is a biosafety level 4 pathogen. There are no FDA-approved therapeutics for Ebola virus. These characteristics warrant the development of surrogates for Ebola virus that can be handled in more convenient laboratory containment to study the biology of the virus and screen for inhibitors. Here we characterized a new surrogate, named E-S-FLU virus, that is based on a disabled influenza virus core coated with the Ebola virus surface protein but does not contain any genetic information from the Ebola virus itself. We show that E-S-FLU virus uses the same cell entry pathway as wild-type Ebola virus. As an example of the ease of use of E-S-FLU virus in biosafety level 1/2 containment, we showed that a single production batch could provide enough surrogate virus to screen a standard small-molecule library of 1,280 candidates for inhibitors of viral entry.","Xiao, Julie Huiyuan; Rijal, Pramila; Schimanski, Lisa; Tharkeshwar, Arun Kumar; Wright, Edward; Annaert, Wim; Townsend, Alain",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5790926/,60
3076,Species-specific vulnerability of RanBP2 shaped the evolution of SIV as it transmitted in African apes,2018-03-08,"HIV-1 arose as the result of spillover of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) from great apes in Africa, namely from chimpanzees and gorillas. Chimpanzees and gorillas were, themselves, infected with SIV after virus spillover from African monkeys. During spillover events, SIV is thought to require adaptation to the new host species. The host barriers that drive viral adaptation have predominantly been attributed to restriction factors, rather than cofactors (host proteins exploited to promote viral replication). Here, we consider the role of one cofactor, RanBP2, in providing a barrier that drove viral genome evolution during SIV spillover events. RanBP2 (also known as Nup358) is a component of the nuclear pore complex known to facilitate nuclear entry of HIV-1. Our data suggest that transmission of SIV from monkeys to chimpanzees, and then from chimpanzees to gorillas, both coincided with changes in the viral capsid that allowed interaction with RanBP2 of the new host species. However, human RanBP2 subsequently provided no barrier to the zoonotic transmission of SIV from chimpanzees or gorillas, indicating that chimpanzee- and gorilla-adapted SIVs are pre-adapted to humans in this regard. Our observations are in agreement with RanBP2 driving virus evolution during cross-species transmissions of SIV, particularly in the transmissions to and between great ape species.","Meyerson, Nicholas R.; Warren, Cody J.; Vieira, Daniel A.

3121,Enterokinase Enhances Influenza A Virus Infection by Activating Trypsinogen in Human Cell Lines,2018-03-23,"Cleavage and activation of hemagglutinin (HA) by trypsin-like proteases in influenza A virus (IAV) are essential prerequisites for its successful infection and spread. In host cells, some transmembrane serine proteases such as TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT, along with plasmin in the bloodstream, have been reported to cleave the HA precursor (HA(0)) molecule into its active forms, HA(1) and HA(2). Some trypsinogens can also enhance IAV proliferation in some cell types (e.g., rat cardiomyoblasts). However, the precise activation mechanism for this process is unclear, because the expression level of the physiological activator of the trypsinogens, the TMPRSS15 enterokinase, is expected to be very low in such cells, with the exception of duodenal cells. Here, we show that at least two variant enterokinases are expressed in various human cell lines, including A549 lung-derived cells. The exogenous expression of these enterokinases was able to enhance the proliferation of IAV in 293T human kidney cells, but the proliferation was reduced by knocking down the endogenous enterokinase in A549 cells. The enterokinase was able to enhance HA processing in the cells, which activated trypsinogen in vitro and in the IAV-infected cells also. Therefore, we conclude that enterokinase plays a role in IAV infection and proliferation by activating trypsinogen to process viral HA in human cell lines.","Hayashi, Hideki; Kubo, Yoshinao; Izumida, Mai; Takahashi, Etsuhisa; Kido, Hiroshi; Sato, Ko; Yamaya, Mutsuo; Nishimura, Hidekazu; Nakayama, Kou; Matsuyama, Toshifumi",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5876233/,60
3350,Pretreatment Hepatitis C Virus NS5A/NS5B Resistance-Associated Substitutions in Genotype 1 Uruguayan Infected Patients,2018-08-14,"Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection treatment has dramatically changed with the advent of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). However, the efficacy of DAAs can be attenuated by the presence of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) before and after treatment. Indeed, RASs detected in DAA treatment-naïve HCV-infected patients could be useful for clinical management and outcome prediction. Although the frequency of naturally occurring HCV NS5A and NS5B RASs has been addressed in many countries, there are only a few reports on their prevalence in the South American region. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of RASs to NS5A and NS5B inhibitors in a DAA treatment naïve cohort of Uruguayan patients infected with chronic hepatitis C and compare them with reports from other South American countries. Here, we found that naturally occurring substitutions conferring resistance to NS5A and NS5B inhibitors were present in 8% and 19.2%, respectively, of treatment-naïve HCV genotype 1 infected patients. Importantly, the baseline substitutions in NS5A and NS5B herein identified differ from the studies previously reported in Brazil. Furthermore, Uruguayan strains subtype 1a clustered within all major world clades, showing that HCV variants currently circulating in this country are characterized by a remarkable genetic diversity.","Aldunate, Fabián; Echeverría, Natalia; Chiodi, Daniela; López, Pablo; Sánchez-Cicerón, Adriana; Fajardo, Alvaro; Soñora, Martín; Cristina, Juan; Hernández, Nelia; Moreno, Pilar",Dis Markers,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6112080/,60
3426,A polymorphic residue that attenuates the antiviral potential of interferon lambda 4 in hominid lineages,2018-10-11,"As antimicrobial signalling molecules, type III or lambda interferons (IFNλs) are critical for defence against infection by diverse pathogens, including bacteria, fungi and viruses. Counter-intuitively, expression of one member of the family, IFNλ4, is associated with decreased clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the human population; by contrast, a natural frameshift mutation that abrogates IFNλ4 production improves HCV clearance. To further understand how genetic variation between and within species affects IFNλ4 function, we screened a panel of all known extant coding variants of human IFNλ4 for their antiviral potential and identify three that substantially affect activity: P70S, L79F and K154E. The most notable variant was K154E, which was found in African Congo rainforest ‘Pygmy’ hunter-gatherers. K154E greatly enhanced in vitro activity in a range of antiviral (HCV, Zika virus, influenza virus and encephalomyocarditis virus) and gene expression assays. Remarkably, E154 is the ancestral residue in mammalian IFNλ4s and is extremely well conserved, yet K154 has been fixed throughout evolution of the hominid genus Homo, including Neanderthals. Compared to chimpanzee IFNλ4, the human orthologue had reduced activity due to amino acid K154. Comparison of published gene expression data from humans and chimpanzees showed that this difference in activity between K154 and E154 in IFNλ4 correlates with differences in antiviral gene expression in vivo during HCV infection. Mechanistically, our data show that the human-specific K154 negatively affects IFNλ4 activity through a novel means by reducing its secretion and potency. We thus demonstrate that attenuated activity of IFNλ4 is conserved among humans and postulate that differences in IFNλ4 activity between species contribute to distinct host-specific responses to—and outcomes of—infection, such as HCV infection. The driver of reduced IFNλ4 antiviral activity in humans remains unknown but likely arose between 6 million and 360,000 years ago in Africa.","Bamford, Connor G.

3537,γδ T Cells Provide Protective Function in Highly Pathogenic Avian H5N1 Influenza A Virus Infection,2018-12-04,"Given the high mortality rate (>50%) and potential danger of intrapersonal transmission, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 epidemics still pose a significant threat to humans. γδ T cells, which participate on the front line of the host immune defense, demonstrate both innate, and adaptive characteristics in their immune response and have potent antiviral activity against various viruses. However, the roles of γδ T cells in HPAI H5N1 viral infection remain unclear. In this study, we found that γδ T cells provided a crucial protective function in the defense against HPAI H5N1 viral infection. HPAI H5N1 viruses could directly activate γδ T cells, leading to enhanced CD69 expression and IFN-γ secretion. Importantly, we found that the trimer but not the monomer of HPAI H5N1 virus hemagglutinin (HA) proteins could directly activate γδ T cells. HA-induced γδ T cell activation was dependent on both sialic acid receptors and HA glycosylation, and this activation could be inhibited by the phosphatase calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A but not by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. Our findings provide a further understanding the mechanism underlying γδ T cell-mediated innate and adoptive immune responses against HPAI H5N1 viral infection, which helps to develop novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of H5N1 infection in the future.","Dong, Peng; Ju, Xiangwu; Yan, Yiwu; Zhang, Siya; Cai, Menghua; Wang, Huaishan; Chen, Hui; Hu, Yu; Cui, Lianxian; Zhang, Jianmin; He, Wei",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6288289/,60
3579,Methanolic Extract of Rhizoma Coptidis Inhibits the Early Viral Entry Steps of Hepatitis C Virus Infection,2018-11-27,"Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) remains an important public health threat with approximately 170 million carriers worldwide who are at risk of developing hepatitis C-associated end-stage liver diseases. Despite improvement of HCV treatment using the novel direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting viral replication, there is a lack of prophylactic measures for protection against HCV infection. Identifying novel antivirals such as those that target viral entry could help broaden the therapeutic arsenal against HCV. Herein, we investigated the anti-HCV activity of the methanolic extract from Rhizoma coptidis (RC), a widely used traditional Chinese medicine documented by the WHO and experimentally reported to possess several pharmacological functions including antiviral effects. Using the cell culture-derived HCV system, we demonstrated that RC dose-dependently inhibited HCV infection of Huh-7.5 cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations. In particular, RC blocked HCV attachment and entry/fusion into the host cells without exerting any significant effect on the cell-free viral particles or modulating key host cell entry factors to HCV. Moreover, RC robustly suppressed HCV pseudoparticles infection of Huh-7.5 cells and impeded infection by several HCV genotypes. Collectively, our results identified RC as a potent antagonist to HCV entry with potential pan-genotypic properties, which deserves further evaluation for use as an anti-HCV agent.","Hung, Ting-Chun; Jassey, Alagie; Lin, Chien-Ju; Liu, Ching-Hsuan; Lin, Chun-Ching; Yen, Ming-Hong; Lin, Liang-Tzung",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6315547/,60
3602,Rapid interferon independent expression of IFITM3 following T cell activation protects cells from influenza virus infection,2019-01-16,"Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is a potent antiviral protein that enhances cellular resistance to a variety of pathogens, including influenza virus. Classically defined as an interferon-stimulated gene, expression of IFITM3 on cells is rapidly up-regulated in response to type I and II interferon. Here we found that IFITM3 is rapidly up-regulated by T cells following their activation and this occurred independently of type I and II interferon and the interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7. Up-regulation of IFITM3 on effector T cells protected these cells from virus infection and imparted a survival advantage at sites of virus infection. Our results show that IFITM3 expression on effector T cells is crucial for these cells to mediate their effector function and highlights an interferon independent pathway for the induction of IFITM3 which, if targeted, could be an effective approach to harness the activity of IFITM3 for infection prevention.","Bedford, James G.; O’Keeffe, Meredith; Reading, Patrick C.; Wakim, Linda M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6334895/,60
3608,Chikungunya Virus Fidelity Variants Exhibit Differential Attenuation and Population Diversity in Cell Culture and Adult Mice,2019-01-17,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging global health threat that produces debilitating arthritis in people. Like other RNA viruses with high mutation rates, CHIKV produces populations of genetically diverse genomes within a host. While several known CHIKV mutations influence disease severity in vertebrates and transmission by mosquitoes, the role of intrahost diversity in chikungunya arthritic disease has not been studied. In this study, high- and low-fidelity CHIKV variants, previously characterized by altered in vitro population mutation frequencies, were used to evaluate how intrahost diversity influences clinical disease, CHIKV replication, and antibody neutralization in immunocompetent adult mice inoculated in the rear footpads. Both high- and low-fidelity mutations were hypothesized to attenuate CHIKV arthritic disease, replication, and neutralizing antibody levels compared to wild-type (WT) CHIKV. Unexpectedly, high-fidelity mutants elicited more severe arthritic disease than the WT despite comparable CHIKV replication, whereas a low-fidelity mutant produced attenuated disease and replication. Serum antibody developed against both high- and low-fidelity CHIKV exhibited reduced neutralization of WT CHIKV. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), the high-fidelity mutations were demonstrated to be genetically stable but produced more genetically diverse populations than WT CHIKV in mice. This enhanced diversification was subsequently reproduced after serial in vitro passage. The NGS results contrast with previously reported population diversities for fidelity variants, which focused mainly on part of the E1 gene, and highlight the need for direct measurements of mutation rates to clarify CHIKV fidelity phenotypes. IMPORTANCE CHIKV is a reemerging global health threat that elicits debilitating arthritis in humans. There are currently no commercially available CHIKV vaccines. Like other RNA viruses, CHIKV has a high mutation rate and is capable of rapid intrahost diversification during an infection. In other RNA viruses, virus population diversity associates with disease progression; however, potential impacts of intrahost viral diversity on CHIKV arthritic disease have not been studied. Using previously characterized CHIKV fidelity variants, we addressed whether CHIKV population diversity influences the severity of arthritis and host antibody response in an arthritic mouse model. Our findings show that CHIKV populations with greater genetic diversity can cause more severe disease and stimulate antibody responses with reduced neutralization of low-diversity virus populations in vitro. The discordant high-fidelity phenotypes in this study highlight the complexity of inferring replication fidelity indirectly from population diversity.","Riemersma, Kasen K.; Steiner, Cody; Singapuri, Anil; Coffey, Lark L.",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6340026/,60
3613,Probing the impact of nairovirus genomic diversity on viral ovarian tumor domain protease (vOTU) structure and deubiquitinase activity,2019-01-10,"Post-translational modification of host and viral proteins by ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like proteins, such as interferon stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15), plays a key role in response to infection. Viruses have been increasingly identified that contain proteases possessing deubiquitinase (DUB) and/or deISGylase functions. This includes viruses in the Nairoviridae family that encode a viral homologue of the ovarian tumor protease (vOTU). vOTU activity was recently demonstrated to be critical for replication of the often-fatal Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, with DUB activity suppressing the type I interferon responses and deISGylase activity broadly removing ISG15 conjugated proteins. There are currently about 40 known nairoviruses classified into fourteen species. Recent genomic characterization has revealed a high degree of diversity, with vOTUs showing less than 25% amino acids identities within the family. Previous investigations have been limited to only a few closely related nairoviruses, leaving it unclear what impact this diversity has on vOTU function. To probe the effects of vOTU diversity on enzyme activity and specificity, we assessed representative vOTUs spanning the Nairoviridae family towards Ub and ISG15 fluorogenic substrates. This revealed great variation in enzymatic activity and specific substrate preferences. A subset of the vOTUs were further assayed against eight biologically relevant di-Ub substrates, uncovering both common trends and distinct preferences of poly-Ub linkages by vOTUs. Four novel X-ray crystal structures were obtained that provide a biochemical rationale for vOTU substrate preferences and elucidate structural features that distinguish the vOTUs, including a motif in the Hughes orthonairovirus species that has not been previously observed in OTU domains. Additionally, structure-informed mutagenesis provided the first direct evidence of a second site involved in di-Ub binding for vOTUs. These results provide new insight into nairovirus evolution and pathogenesis, and further enhances the development of tools for therapeutic purposes.","Dzimianski, John V.; Beldon, Brianna S.; Daczkowski, Courtney M.; Goodwin, Octavia Y.; Scholte, Florine E.

3775,Dichloro-Phenyl-Benzotriazoles: A New Selective Class of Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus Entry Inhibitors,2019-04-16,"Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the primary cause of bronchopneumonia in infants and children worldwide. Clinical studies have shown that early treatments of RSV patients with ribavirin improve prognosis, even if the use of this drug is limited due to myelosuppression and toxicity effects. Furthermore, effective vaccines to prevent RSV infection are currently unavailable. Thus, the development of highly effective and specific antiviral drugs for pre-exposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of RSV infections is a compelling need. In the quest of new RSV inhibitors, in this work we evaluated the antiviral activity of a series of variously substituted 5,6-dichloro-1-phenyl-1(2)H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole derivatives in cell-based assays. Several 1- and 2-phenyl-benzotriazoles resulted fairly potent (μM concentrations) inhibitors of RSV infection in plaque reduction assays, accompanied by low cytotoxicity in human highly dividing T lymphoid-derived cells and primary cell lines. Contextually, no inhibitory effects were observed against other RNA or DNA viruses assayed, suggesting specific activity against RSV. Further results revealed that the lead compound 10d was active during the early phase of the RSV infection cycle. To understand whether 10d interfered with virus attachment to target cells or virus-cell fusion events, inhibitory activity tests against the RSV mutant strain B1 cp-52—expressing only the F envelope glycoprotein—and a plasmid-based reporter assay that quantifies the bioactivity of viral entry were also performed. The overall biological results, in conjunction with in silico modeling studies, supported the conclusion that the RSV fusion process could be the target of this new series of compounds.","Piras, Sandra; Sanna, Giuseppina; Carta, Antonio; Corona, Paola; Ibba, Roberta; Loddo, Roberta; Madeddu, Silvia; Caria, Paola; Aulic, Suzana; Laurini, Erik; Fermeglia, Maurizio; Pricl, Sabrina",Front Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6476926/,60
3798,"Human, Nonhuman Primate, and Bat Cells Are Broadly Susceptible to Tibrovirus Particle Cell Entry",2019-04-26,"In 2012, the genome of a novel rhabdovirus, Bas-Congo virus (BASV), was discovered in the acute-phase serum of a Congolese patient with presumed viral hemorrhagic fever. In the absence of a replicating virus isolate, fulfilling Koch’s postulates to determine whether BASV is indeed a human virus and/or pathogen has been impossible. However, experiments with vesiculoviral particles pseudotyped with Bas-Congo glycoprotein suggested that BASV particles can enter cells from multiple animals, including humans. In 2015, genomes of two related viruses, Ekpoma virus 1 (EKV-1) and Ekpoma virus 2 (EKV-2), were detected in human sera in Nigeria. Isolates could not be obtained. Phylogenetic analyses led to the classification of BASV, EKV-1, and EKV-2 in the same genus, Tibrovirus, together with five biting midge-borne rhabdoviruses [i.e., Beatrice Hill virus (BHV), Bivens Arm virus (BAV), Coastal Plains virus (CPV), Sweetwater Branch virus (SWBV), and Tibrogargan virus (TIBV)] not known to infect humans. Using individual recombinant vesiculoviruses expressing the glycoproteins of all eight known tibroviruses and more than 75 cell lines representing different animal species, we demonstrate that the glycoproteins of all tibroviruses can mediate vesiculovirus particle entry into human, bat, nonhuman primate, cotton rat, boa constrictor, and Asian tiger mosquito cells. Using four of five isolated authentic tibroviruses (i.e., BAV, CPV, SWBV, and TIBV), our experiments indicate that many cell types may be partially resistant to tibrovirus replication after virion cell entry. Consequently, experimental data solely obtained from experiments using tibrovirus surrogate systems (e.g., vesiculoviral pseudotypes, recombinant vesiculoviruses) cannot be used to predict whether BASV, or any other tibrovirus, infects humans.","Caì, Yíngyún; Yú, Shuǐqìng; Jangra, Rohit K.; Postnikova, Elena N.; Wada, Jiro; Tesh, Robert B.; Whelan, Sean P.

3814,Quantitative Temporal Proteomic Analysis of Vaccinia Virus Infection Reveals Regulation of Histone Deacetylases by an Interferon Antagonist,2019-05-07,"Vaccinia virus (VACV) has numerous immune evasion strategies, including multiple mechanisms of inhibition of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Here, we use highly multiplexed proteomics to quantify ∼9,000 cellular proteins and ∼80% of viral proteins at seven time points throughout VACV infection. A total of 265 cellular proteins are downregulated >2-fold by VACV, including putative natural killer cell ligands and IFN-stimulated genes. Two-thirds of these viral targets, including class II histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5), are degraded proteolytically during infection. In follow-up analysis, we demonstrate that HDAC5 restricts replication of both VACV and herpes simplex virus type 1. By generating a protein-based temporal classification of VACV gene expression, we identify protein C6, a multifunctional IFN antagonist, as being necessary and sufficient for proteasomal degradation of HDAC5. Our approach thus identifies both a host antiviral factor and a viral mechanism of innate immune evasion.","Soday, Lior; Lu, Yongxu; Albarnaz, Jonas D.; Davies, Colin T.R.; Antrobus, Robin; Smith, Geoffrey L.; Weekes, Michael P.",Cell Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6518873/,60

Recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSV) expressing foreign glycoproteins (GP) have shown promise as experimental vaccines for several viral hemorrhagic fevers. Here, we developed and assessed a replication competent rVSV vector expressing the CCHFV glycoprotein precursor (GPC), which encodes CCHFV structural glycoproteins. This construct drives strong expression of CCHFV-GP, in vitro. Using these vectors, we vaccinated STAT-1 knock-out mice, an animal model for CCHFV. The vector was tolerated and 100% efficacious against challenge from a clinical strain of CCHFV. Anti-CCHFV-GP IgG and neutralizing antibody titers were observed in surviving animals.

Nevertheless, the basis for the host-range restriction is unknown despite past systematic attempts to identify the relevant missing viral gene(s). The search for host-range factors is exacerbated by the large number of deletions, truncations and mutations that occurred during the long passage history of MVA in chicken embryo fibroblasts. By whole genome sequencing of a panel of recombinant host-range extended (HRE) MVAs generated by marker rescue with 40 kbp segments of vaccinia virus DNA, we identified serine protease inhibitor 1 (SPI-1) as one of several candidate host-range factors present in those viruses that gained the ability to replicate in human cells. Electron microscopy revealed that the interruption of morphogenesis in human cells infected with MVA occurred at a similar stage as that of a vaccinia virus strain WR SPI-1 deletion mutant. Moreover, the introduction of the SPI-1 gene into the MVA genome led to more than a 2-log enhancement of virus spread in human diploid MRC-5 cells, whereas deletion of the gene diminished the spread of HRE viruses by similar extents. Furthermore, MRC-5 cells stably expressing SPI-1 also enhanced replication of MVA. A role for additional host range genes was suggested by the restoration of MVA replication to a lower level relative to HRE viruses, particularly in other human cell lines. Although multiple sequence alignments revealed genetic changes in addition to SPI-1 common to the HRE MVAs, no evidence for their host-range function was found by analysis thus far. Our finding that SPI-1 is host range factor for MVA should simplify use of high throughput RNAi or CRISPR/Cas single gene methods to identify additional viral and human restriction elements.","Liu, Ruikang; Mendez-Rios, Jorge D.; Peng, Chen; Xiao, Wei; Weisberg, Andrea S.; Wyatt, Linda S.; Moss, Bernard",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6542542/,60
3866,Host–Microbe Interactions and Gut Health in Poultry—Focus on Innate Responses,2019-05-16,"Commercial poultry are continually exposed to, frequently pathogenic, microorganisms, usually via mucosal surfaces such as the intestinal mucosa. Thus, understanding host–microbe interactions is vital. Many of these microorganisms may have no or limited contact with the host, while most of those interacting more meaningfully with the host will be dealt with by the innate immune response. Fundamentally, poultry have evolved to have immune responses that are generally appropriate and adequate for their acquired microbiomes, although this is challenged by commercial production practices. Innate immune cells and their functions, encompassing inflammatory responses, create the context for neutralising the stimulus and initiating resolution. Dysregulated inflammatory responses can be detrimental but, being a highly conserved biological process, inflammation is critical for host defence. Heterogeneity and functional plasticity of innate immune cells is underappreciated and offers the potential for (gut) health interventions, perhaps including exogenous opportunities to influence immune cell metabolism and thus function. New approaches could focus on identifying and enhancing decisive but less harmful immune processes, improving the efficiency of innate immune cells (e.g., targeted, efficient microbial killing) and promoting phenotypes that drive resolution of inflammation. Breeding strategies and suitable exogenous interventions offer potential solutions to enhance poultry gut health, performance and welfare.","Broom, Leon J.",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6560434/,60
3871,Coxsackievirus B3 Responds to Polyamine Depletion via Enhancement of 2A and 3C Protease Activity,2019-04-30,"Polyamines are small positively-charged molecules abundant in eukaryotic cells that are crucial to RNA virus replication. In eukaryotic cells, polyamines facilitate processes such as transcription, translation, and DNA replication, and viruses similarly rely on polyamines to facilitate transcription and translation. Whether polyamines function at additional stages in viral replication remains poorly understood. Picornaviruses, including Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), are sensitive to polyamine depletion both in vitro and in vivo; however, precisely how polyamine function in picornavirus infection has not been described. Here, we describe CVB3 mutants that arise with passage in polyamine-depleted conditions. We observe mutations in the 2A and 3C proteases, and we find that these mutant proteases confer resistance to polyamine depletion. Using a split luciferase reporter system to measure protease activity, we determined that polyamines facilitate viral protease activity. We further observe that the 2A and 3C protease mutations enhance reporter protease activity in polyamine-depleted conditions. Finally, we find that these mutations promote cleavage of cellular eIF4G during infection of polyamine-depleted cells. In sum, our results suggest that polyamines are crucial to protease function during picornavirus infection. Further, these data highlight viral proteases as potential antiviral targets and highlight how CVB3 may overcome polyamine-depleting antiviral therapies.","Dial, Courtney N.; Tate, Patrick M.; Kicmal, Thomas M.; Mounce, Bryan C.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6563312/,60
3887,"The Group B Streptococcal surface antigen I/II protein, BspC, interacts with host vimentin to promote adherence to brain endothelium and inflammation during the pathogenesis of meningitis",2019-06-10,"Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) normally colonizes healthy adults but can cause invasive disease, such as meningitis, in the newborn. To gain access to the central nervous system, GBS must interact with and penetrate brain or meningeal blood vessels; however, the exact mechanisms are still being elucidated. Here, we investigate the contribution of BspC, an antigen I/II family adhesin, to the pathogenesis of GBS meningitis. Disruption of the bspC gene reduced GBS adherence to human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC), while heterologous expression of BspC in non-adherent Lactococcus lactis conferred bacterial attachment. In a murine model of hematogenous meningitis, mice infected with ΔbspC mutants exhibited lower mortality as well as decreased brain bacterial counts and inflammatory infiltrate compared to mice infected with WT GBS strains. Further, BspC was both necessary and sufficient to induce neutrophil chemokine expression. We determined that BspC interacts with the host cytoskeleton component vimentin and confirmed this interaction using a bacterial two-hybrid assay, microscale thermophoresis, immunofluorescent staining, and imaging flow cytometry. Vimentin null mice were protected from WT GBS infection and also exhibited less inflammatory cytokine production in brain tissue. These results suggest that BspC and the vimentin interaction is critical for the pathogenesis of GBS meningitis.","Deng, Liwen; Spencer, Brady L.; Holmes, Joshua A.; Mu, Rong; Rego, Sara; Weston, Thomas A.; Hu, Yoonsung; Sanches, Glenda F.; Yoon, Sunghyun; Park, Nogi; Nagao, Prescilla E.; Jenkinson, Howard F.; Thornton, Justin A.; Seo, Keun Seok; Nobbs, Angela H.; Doran, Kelly S.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6586375/,60

However, resistant strains may impose substantial challenges. Here, we report on the identification and characterization of a panel of HIV-1 strains with broad and potent resistance against a large number of bnAbs, particularly those targeting the CD4-binding site (CD4bs). Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that several key epitope mutations facilitate resistance and are located in the inner domain, loop D, and β23/loop V5/β24 of HIV-1 gp120. The resistance is largely correlated with binding affinity of antibodies to the envelope trimers expressed on the cell surface. Our results therefore demonstrate the existence of broadly resistant HIV-1 strains against CD4bs neutralizing antibodies. Treatment strategies based on the CD4bs bnAbs must overcome such resistance to achieve optimal clinical outcomes.","Zhou, Panpan; Wang, Han; Fang, Mengqi; Li, Yangyang; Wang, Hua; Shi, Shasha; Li, Zihao; Wu, Jiapeng; Han, Xiaoxu; Shi, Xuanling; Shang, Hong; Zhou, Tongqing; Zhang, Linqi",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6592578/,60
3979,Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans and Viral Attachment: True Receptors or Adaptation Bias?,2019-07-01,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) are composed of unbranched, negatively charged heparan sulfate (HS) polysaccharides attached to a variety of cell surface or extracellular matrix proteins. Widely expressed, they mediate many biological activities, including angiogenesis, blood coagulation, developmental processes, and cell homeostasis. HSPG are highly sulfated and broadly used by a range of pathogens, especially viruses, to attach to the cell surface. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on HSPG–virus interactions and distinguish viruses with established HS binding, viruses that bind HS only after intra-host or cell culture adaptation, and finally, viruses whose dependence on HS for infection is debated. We also provide an overview of the antiviral compounds designed to interfere with HS binding. Many questions remain about the true importance of these receptors in vivo, knowledge that is critical for the design of future antiviral therapies.","Cagno, Valeria; Tseligka, Eirini D.; Jones, Samuel T.; Tapparel, Caroline",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6669472/,60
3984,Viroporins in the Influenza Virus,2019-06-29,"Influenza is a highly contagious virus that causes seasonal epidemics and unpredictable pandemics. Four influenza virus types have been identified to date: A, B, C and D, with only A–C known to infect humans. Influenza A and B viruses are responsible for seasonal influenza epidemics in humans and are responsible for up to a billion flu infections annually. The M2 protein is present in all influenza types and belongs to the class of viroporins, i.e., small proteins that form ion channels that increase membrane permeability in virus-infected cells. In influenza A and B, AM2 and BM2 are predominantly proton channels, although they also show some permeability to monovalent cations. By contrast, M2 proteins in influenza C and D, CM2 and DM2, appear to be especially selective for chloride ions, with possibly some permeability to protons. These differences point to different biological roles for M2 in types A and B versus C and D, which is also reflected in their sequences. AM2 is by far the best characterized viroporin, where mechanistic details and rationale of its acid activation, proton selectivity, unidirectionality, and relative low conductance are beginning to be understood. The present review summarizes the biochemical and structural aspects of influenza viroporins and discusses the most relevant aspects of function, inhibition, and interaction with the host.","To, Janet; Torres, Jaume",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6679168/,60

However, this powerful technology is difficult to apply in diagnostic laboratories because of its computational and bioinformatic demands. We have developed DisCVR, which detects known human viruses in clinical samples by matching sample k-mers (twenty-two nucleotide sequences) to k-mers from taxonomically labeled viral genomes. DisCVR was validated using published HTS data for eighty-nine clinical samples from adults with upper respiratory tract infections. These samples had been tested for viruses metagenomically and also by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, which is the standard diagnostic method. DisCVR detected human viruses with high sensitivity (79%) and specificity (100%), and was able to detect mixed infections. Moreover, it produced results comparable to those in a published metagenomic analysis of 177 blood samples from patients in Nigeria. DisCVR has been designed as a user-friendly tool for detecting human viruses from HTS data using computers with limited RAM and processing power, and includes a graphical user interface to help users interpret and validate the output.

We find that NTZ enhances retinoic-acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I)-like-receptor, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, interferon regulatory factor 3, and interferon activities and induces transcription of the antiviral phosphatase GADD34. NTZ significantly inhibits EBOV replication in human cells through its effects on RIG-I and protein kinase R (PKR), suggesting that it counteracts EBOV VP35 protein's ability to block RIG-I and PKR sensing of EBOV. NTZ also inhibits a second negative-strand RNA virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), through RIG-I and GADD34, but not PKR, consistent with VSV's distinct host innate immune evasion mechanisms. Thus, NTZ counteracts varied virus-specific immune evasion strategies by generally enhancing the RNA sensing and interferon axis that is triggered by foreign cytoplasmic RNA exposure, and holds promise as an oral therapy against EBOV.","Jasenosky, Luke D.; Cadena, Cristhian; Mire, Chad E.; Borisevich, Viktoriya; Haridas, Viraga; Ranjbar, Shahin; Nambu, Aya; Bavari, Sina; Soloveva, Veronica; Sadukhan, Supriya; Cassell, Gail H.; Geisbert, Thomas W.; Hur, Sun; Goldfeld, Anne E.",iScience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6831822/,60
4152,Subclinical in utero Zika virus infection is associated with interferon alpha sequelae and sex-specific molecular brain pathology in asymptomatic porcine offspring,2019-11-14,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during human pregnancy may lead to severe fetal pathology and debilitating impairments in offspring. However, the majority of infections are subclinical and not associated with evident birth defects. Potentially detrimental life-long health outcomes in asymptomatic offspring evoke high concerns. Thus, animal models addressing sequelae in offspring may provide valuable information. To induce subclinical infection, we inoculated selected porcine fetuses at the mid-stage of development. Inoculation resulted in trans-fetal virus spread and persistent infection in the placenta and fetal membranes for two months. Offspring did not show congenital Zika syndrome (e.g., microcephaly, brain calcifications, congenital clubfoot, arthrogryposis, seizures) or other visible birth defects. However, a month after birth, a portion of offspring exhibited excessive interferon alpha (IFN-α) levels in blood plasma in a regular environment. Most affected offspring also showed dramatic IFN-α shutdown during social stress providing the first evidence for the cumulative impact of prenatal ZIKV exposure and postnatal environmental insult. Other eleven cytokines tested before and after stress were not altered suggesting the specific IFN-α pathology. While brains from offspring did not have histopathology, lesions, and ZIKV, the whole genome expression analysis of the prefrontal cortex revealed profound sex-specific transcriptional changes that most probably was the result of subclinical in utero infection. RNA-seq analysis in the placenta persistently infected with ZIKV provided independent support for the sex-specific pattern of in utero-acquired transcriptional responses. Collectively, our results provide strong evidence that two hallmarks of fetal ZIKV infection, altered type I IFN response and molecular brain pathology can persist after birth in offspring in the absence of congenital Zika syndrome.","Trus, Ivan; Udenze, Daniel; Cox, Brian; Berube, Nathalie; Nordquist, Rebecca E.; van der Staay, Franz Josef; Huang, Yanyun; Kobinger, Gary; Safronetz, David; Gerdts, Volker; Karniychuk, Uladzimir",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6855438/,60

METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from: two Blue and gold macaws, one positive and one negative for avian bornavirus by RT-PCR; a Cockatiel and a Monk parakeet prior to and following experimental infection; and, two Mallards, one positive and one negative for avian bornavirus by RT-PCR Samples were analyzed by Western blot and dot-blot ELISA that incorporated recombinant avian bornavirus nucleoprotein as the target analyte. Four species-specific anti-IgY secondary antibodies were used in the assays: goat anti-macaw IgY, goat anti-bird IgY, goat anti-duck IgY, and rabbit anti-chicken IgY. RESULTS: In the Western blot, anti-macaw IgY secondary antibody produced strong signals with Blue and gold macaw and Cockatiel positive plasma, but no signal with Mallard positive plasma. Anti-bird IgY secondary antibody produced strong signals with Blue and gold macaw, Cockatiel, and Mallard positive plasma. Anti-duck and anti-chicken IgY secondary antibody produced a strong and moderate signal, respectively, only with Mallard positive plasma. In the dot-blot ELISA, there was a distinct and significant difference (P<0.05) in the signal intensity between the different secondary antibodies within a bird species. Anti-macaw IgY secondary antibody produced significantly (P<0.05) stronger signals than the other secondary antibodies in Blue and gold macaw, Cockatiel, and Monk parakeet positive plasma, while anti-duck IgY secondary antibody produced significantly (P<0.05) stronger signals than the other secondary antibodies in Mallard positive plasma. CONCLUSION: In testing psittacines with immunoassays, and especially in assays that incorporate short incubation reaction times such as a dot-blot ELISA, species-specific anti-IgY secondary antibodies provided more accurate results.","Escandon, Paulina; Heatley, J Jill; Berghman, Luc R; Tizard, Ian; Musser, Jeffrey MB",Vet Med (Auckl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6858837/,60

Here, we map the endogenous in vivo ISGylome in the liver following Listeria monocytogenes infection by combining murine models of reduced or enhanced ISGylation with quantitative proteomics. Our method identifies 930 ISG15 sites in 434 proteins and also detects changes in the host ubiquitylome. The ISGylated targets are enriched in proteins which alter cellular metabolic processes, including upstream modulators of the catabolic and antibacterial pathway of autophagy. Computational analysis of substrate structures reveals that a number of ISG15 modifications occur at catalytic sites or dimerization interfaces of enzymes. Finally, we demonstrate that animals and cells with enhanced ISGylation have increased basal and infection-induced autophagy through the modification of mTOR, WIPI2, AMBRA1, and RAB7.

4181,The Establishment and Validation of the Human U937 Cell Line as a Cellular Model to Screen Immunomodulatory Agents Regulating Cytokine Release Induced by Influenza Virus Infection,2019-07-08,"Severe influenza infections are often associated with the excessive induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which is also referred to as “cytokine storms”. Several studies have shown that cytokine storms are directly associated with influenza-induced fatal acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Due to the narrow administration window, current antiviral therapies are often inadequate. The efforts to use immunomodulatory agents alone or in combination with antiviral agents in the treatment of influenza in animal models have resulted in the achievement of protective effects accompanied with reduced cytokine production. Currently, there are no immunomodulatory drugs for influenza available for clinical use. Animal models, despite being ideal to study the anti-inflammatory responses to influenza virus infection, are very costly and time-consuming. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish fast and economical screening methods using cell-based models to screen and develop novel immunomodulatory agents. In this study, we screened seven human cell lines and found that the human monocytic cell U937 supports the replication of different subtypes of influenza viruses as well as the production of the important pro-inflammatory cytokines and was selected to develop the cell-based model. The U937 cell model was validated by testing a panel of known antiviral and immunomodulatory agents and screening a drug library consisting of 1280 compounds comprised mostly of FDA-approved drugs. We demonstrated that the U937 cell model is robust and suitable for the high-throughput screening of immunomodulators and antivirals against influenza infection.

In this study, mouse pulmonary stem/progenitor cells (mPSCs) with capability to differentiate into type I or type II alveolar cells were used as an in vitro cell model to characterize replication and pathogenic effects of influenza viruses in PSCs. First, mPSCs and its immortalized cell line mPSCs(Oct4+) were shown to be susceptible to PR8, seasonal H1N1, 2009 pandemic H1N1, and H7N9 influenza viruses and can generate infectious virus particles, although with a lower virus titer, which could be attributed by the reduced vRNA replication and nucleoprotein (NP) aggregation in the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, a significant increase of interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon (IFN)-γ at 12 h and IFN-β at 24 h post infection in mPSCs implicates that mPSCs might function as a sensor to modulate immune responses to influenza virus infection. In summary, our results demonstrated mPSCs, as one of the target cells for influenza A viruses, could modulate early proinflammatory responses to influenza virus infection.","Chao, Tai-Ling; Gu, Sing-Yi; Lin, Pi-Han; Chou, Yu-Tien; Ling, Thai-Yen; Chang, Sui-Yuan",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6985155/,60
4414,Intracellular Vesicle Fusion Requires a Membrane-Destabilizing Peptide Located at the Juxtamembrane Region of the v-SNARE,2019-12-24,"Intracellular vesicle fusion is mediated by soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) and Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins. It is generally accepted that membrane fusion occurs when the vesicle and target membranes are brought into close proximity by SNAREs and SM proteins. In this work, we demonstrate that, for fusion to occur, membrane bilayers must be destabilized by a conserved membrane-embedded motif located at the juxtamembrane region of the vesicle-anchored v-SNARE. Comprised of basic and hydrophobic residues, the juxtamembrane motif perturbs the lipid bilayer structure and promotes SNARE-SM-mediated membrane fusion. The juxtamembrane motif can be functionally substituted with an unrelated membrane-disrupting peptide in the membrane fusion reaction. These findings establish the juxtamembrane motif of the v-SNARE as a membrane-destabilizing peptide. Requirement of membrane-destabilizing peptides is likely a common feature of biological membrane fusion.","Rathore, Shailendra S.; Liu, Yinghui; Yu, Haijia; Wan, Chun; Lee, MyeongSeon; Yin, Qian; Stowell, Michael H.B.; Shen, Jingshi",Cell Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6990648/,60

5176,Mechanism of Preferential Packaging of Negative Sense Genomic RNA by Viral Nucleoproteins in Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus,2015-01-30,"The frequency of dispersal of invertebrates among lakes depends upon perspective and spatial scale. Effective passive dispersal requires both the transport of propagules and the establishment of populations large enough to be detected. At a global scale, biogeographic patterns of cladoceran zooplankton species suggest that effective dispersal among continents was originally rare, but greatly increased in the past century with expanded commerce. Genetic analysis allows some reconstruction of past dispersal events. Allozyme and mitochondrial DNA comparisons among New World and Old-World populations of several exotic cladocerans have provided estimates for likely source populations of colonists, their dispersal corridors, and timing of earlier dispersal events. Detecting the Old-World tropical exotic Daphnia lumholtzi early in its invasion of North America has allowed detailed analysis of its spatial spread. Twelve years of collection records indicate a rapid invasion of reservoirs in the United States, by both regional spread and long-distance jumps to new regions. Combining landscape features with zooplankton surveys from south-central US reservoirs revealed higher colonization rates of D. lumholtzi at lower landscape positions, a result which can be explained by either greater propagule load or by higher susceptibility of these downstream reservoirs. Because invaded reservoirs provide a source of propagules for nearby floodplain ponds, the rarity of this species in ponds suggests limitation by local environments. Such analyses of invading species over multiple spatial scales allow a better understanding of ecological processes governing invasion dynamics.","Havel, John E.; Medley, Kim A.",Biol Invasions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088012/,60

RSV is responsible for annual disease outbreaks, usually during a defined winter seasonal period that can vary by community and year. RSV is recognized as the leading cause of hospitalization among young children worldwide. Infants of young chronologic age and children with predisposing factors, such as premature birth, pulmonary disease, or congenital heart disease, are most susceptible to serious illness. Unlike other viruses, immunity to RSV infection is incomplete and short lived, and reinfection is common throughout life. Initial attempts to develop a vaccine in the 1960s met with unexpected and tragic results; many children vaccinated with a formalin-inactivated wild-type virus developed serious pulmonary disease upon subsequent natural infection. Numerous other vaccine technologies have since been studied, including vectored approaches, virus-like particles, DNA vaccines, and live attenuated virus vaccine. As of early 2010, only two companies or institutions had RSV vaccine candidates in early clinical trials, and no vaccine is likely to be licensed for marketing in the immediate future.","Groothuis, Jessie R.; Hoopes, J.

Furthermore, in 33 strains of PRRSV, an identical detection rate was observed with the RT-LAMP assay to what were isolated using porcine alveolar macrophages. These findings demonstrated that the RT-LAMP assay has potential clinical applications for the detection of highly pathogenic PRRSV isolates, especially in developing countries.","Zhang, Lei; Liu, Ye-bing; Chen, Lei; Wang, Jian-huan; Ning, Yi-bao",Virol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091248/,60
5980,Structural basis of West Nile virus neutralization by a therapeutic antibody,2005,"Surfactant replacement therapy is a major breakthrough in neonatal medicine. Prophylaxis or treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) with various surfactant preparations is now a clinical reality. With either strategy the incidence of air leaks and mortality is reduced; more babies with RDS survive without signs of chronic lung disease. The earlier the treatment, the better the outcome. An initial dose of 100 mg/kg can be recommended for all natural preparations, and some babies may benefit from multiple dose treatment. Meta-analyses show a consistent advantage of natural surfactant preparations over the currently available synthetic ones. There is growing evidence that surfactant may also be beneficial in pulmonary diseases of the newborn which are characterized by inactivation of the surfactant system such as meconium aspiration syndrome or neonatal pneumonia.","Speer, C.

6556,"Differences in the epidemiology and virology of mild, severe and fatal human infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus",2016-02-18,"The role of bone marrow transplantation is to restore lymphohematopoietic function of a recipient whose marrow has been destroyed, either by disease or by the preparative therapy employed in an attempt to eradicate the patient's lymphohematopoietic malignancy. The restoration of lymphohematopoietic function through the donor graft occurs in stages, requires several months, and is often not completed until 1 to 2 years after transplantation. These sequential steps of immuno-reconstitution are associated with a number of definable and predictable immune deficiencies and seem to be responsible for the pattern of complications that emerges after transplantation. Most of these complications are either the result of, or associated with, infections that also occur in an almost predictable pattern. In the various phases of immune deficiency following sequentially after transplantation, the humoral immune system is greatly affected, thus raising the possibility that passively administered antibodies in the form of immune globulin therapy might be beneficial in all phases of the marrow transplant procedure. This paper attempts to summarize the use of immune globulin preparations in clinical bone marrow transplantation, showing the rationale for and some of the results of therapeutic immune globulin administration.","Tutschka, Peter J.",J Clin Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101739/,60

Ten days before symptoms onset, he was in direct contact with mice and working in a contaminated drain. Patient laboratory showed acute kidney injury and thrombocytopenia. Chest X-ray exhibited bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrates. First-line empirical antibiotics were started and influenza discarded. Patient evolved with severe respiratory failure, associated with hemoptysis, and rapidly severe hemodynamic compromise. Despite neuromuscular blockade and prone positioning, respiratory failure increased. Accordingly, veno-venous ECMO was initiated, with bilateral femoral extraction and jugular return. After ECMO connection, there was no significant improvement in oxygenation, and low pre-membrane saturations and low arterial PaO(2) of the membrane showed that we were out of the limits of the rated flow. Thus, a second membrane oxygenator was installed in parallel. Afterward, oxygenation improved, with subsequent perfusion enhancement. Regarding etiology, due to high suspicion index, Leptospira serology was performed, coming back positive and meropenem was maintained. The patient ultimately recovered and experience excellent outcome. The clinical relevance of the case is the scared evidence of leptospirosis-associated severe respiratory failure treated with ECMO. This experience emphasizes the importance of an optimal support, which requires enough membrane surface and flow for an obese, highly hyperdynamic patient, during this reversible disease. A high index of suspicion is needed for an adequate diagnosis of leptospirosis to implement the correct treatment, particularly in the association of respiratory failure, pulmonary hemorrhage, and an epidemiological-related context.","Cantwell, Tamara; Ferre, Andrés; Van Sint Jan, Nicolette; Blamey, Rodrigo; Dreyse, Jorge; Baeza, Cristian; Diaz, Rodrigo; Regueira, Tomás",J Artif Organs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102126/,60

10225,Retracted: Immunological properties reveal the monovalent and bivalent recombinant dengue virus‐like particles as candidate vaccine for dengue,2015-03-03,"Inteins are genetic elements found inside the coding regions of different host proteins and are translated in frame with them. The intein‐encoded protein region is removed by an autocatalytic protein‐splicing reaction that ligates the host protein flanks with a peptide bond. This reaction can also occur in trans with the intein and host protein split in two. After translation of the two genes, the two intein parts ligate their flanking protein parts to each other, producing the mature protein. Naturally split inteins are only known in the DNA polymerase III alpha subunit (polC or dnaE gene) of a few cyanobacteria. Analysing the phylogenetic distribution and probable genetic propagation mode of these split inteins, we conclude that they are genetically fixed in several large cyanobacterial lineages. To test our hypothesis, we sequenced parts of the dnaE genes from five diverse cyanobacteria and found all species to have the same type of split intein. Our results suggest the occurrence of a genetic rearrangement in the ancestor of a large division of cyanobacteria. This event fixed the dnaE gene in a unique two‐genes one‐protein configuration in the progenitor of many cyanobacteria. Our hypothesis, findings and the cloning procedure that we established allow the identification and acquisition of many naturally split inteins. Having a large and diverse repertoire of these unique inteins will enable studies of their distinct activity and enhance their use in biotechnology.","Caspi, Jonathan; Amitai, Gil; Belenkiy, Olga; Pietrokovski, Shmuel",Mol Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168405/,60

10639,Interferon‐α Production and Tissue Localization of Interferon‐α/β Producing Cells after Intradermal Administration of Aujeszky's Disease Virus–Infected Cells in Pigs,2006-06-29,"INTRODUCTION: Despite being a participating Solutions for Patient Safety (SPS) children’s hospital and having attempted implementation of the SPS hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs) prevention bundle, our hospital remained at a HAPI rate that was 3 times the mean for SPS participating children’s hospitals. This performance led to the launch of an enterprise-wide HAPI reduction initiative in our organization. The purpose of this article is to describe the improvement initiative, the key drivers, and the resulting decrease in the SPS-reportable HAPI rate. METHODS: We designed a hospital-wide HAPI reduction initiative with actions grouped into 3 key driver areas: standardization, data transparency, and accountability. We paused all individual hospital unit-based HAPI reduction initiatives. We calculated the rate of SPS-reportable HAPIs per 1,000 patient days during both the pre- and postimplementation phases and compared mean rates using a 2-sided t test assuming unequal variances. RESULTS: The mean SPS-reportable HAPI rate for the preimplementation phase was 0.3489, and the postimplementation phase was 0.0609. The difference in rates was statistically significant (P < 0.00032). This result equates to an 82.5% reduction in HAPI rate. CONCLUSIONS: Having an institutional pause and retooled initiative to reduce HAPI with key drivers in the areas of standardization, data transparency, and accountability had a statistically significant reduction in our organization’s SPS-reportable HAPI rate.","Johnson, Andrea K.; Kruger, Jenna F.; Ferrari, Sarah; Weisse, Melissa B.; Hamilton, Marie; Loh, Ling; Chapman, Amy M.; Taylor, Kristine; Bargmann-Losche, Jessey; Donnelly, Lane F.",Pediatr Qual Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190242/,60
10763,Analysis of Expression Profiles of Long Noncoding RNAs and mRNAs in A549 Cells Infected with H3N2 Swine Influenza Virus by RNA Sequencing,2019-11-27,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an enveloped RNA virus which is responsible for approximately 80% of lower respiratory tract infections in children. Current lines of evidence have supported the functional involvement of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in many viral infectious diseases. However, the overall biological effect and clinical role of lncRNAs in RSV infection remain unclear. In this study, lncRNAs related to respiratory virus infection were obtained from the lncRNA database, and we collected 144 clinical sputum specimens to identify lncRNAs related to RSV infection. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) detection indicated that the expression of lncRNA negative regulator of antiviral response (NRAV) in RSV-positive patients was significantly lower than that in uninfected patients, but lncRNA psoriasis-associated non-protein coding RNA induced by stress (PRINS), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1), and Nettoie Salmonella pas Theiler’s (NeST) showed no difference in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, overexpression of NRAV promoted RSV proliferation in A549 and BEAS-2B cells, and vice versa, indicating that the downregulation of NRAV was part of the host antiviral defense. RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed that NRAV was mainly located in the cytoplasm. Through RNA sequencing, we found that Rab5c, which is a vesicle transporting protein, showed the same change trend as NRAV. Subsequent investigation revealed that NRAV was able to favor RSV production indirectly by sponging microRNA miR-509-3p so as to release Rab5c and facilitate vesicle transportation. The study provides a new insight into virus-host interaction through noncoding RNA, which may contribute to exploring potential antivirus targets for respiratory virus. IMPORTANCE The mechanism of interaction between RSV and host noncoding RNAs is not fully understood. In this study, we found that the expression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) negative regulator of antiviral response (NRAV) was reduced in RSV-infected patients, and overexpression of NRAV facilitated RSV production in vitro, suggesting that the reduction of NRAV in RSV infection was part of the host antiviral response. We also found that NRAV competed with vesicle protein Rab5c for microRNA miR509-3p in cytoplasm to promote RSV vesicle transport and accelerate RSV proliferation, thereby improving our understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of RSV infection.","Li, Jian; Li, Miao; Wang, Xiuli; Sun, Mengfei; Ma, Cuiqing; Liang, Wenzhang; Gao, Xue; Wei, Lin",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7199404/,60
10965,"Characterization of HIV-1 subtypes and drug resistance mutations in Henan Province, China (2017–2019)",2020-04-11,"BACKGROUND: Prolonged empiric antibiotic use, resulting from diagnostic uncertainties, in suspected early onset sepsis (EOS) cases constitutes a significant problem. Unnecessary antibiotic use increases the risk of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, prolonged antibiotic use increases the risk of mortality and morbidity in neonates. Proactive measures including empiric antibiotic de-escalation are crucial to overcome these problems. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study conducted in the neonatal intensive care units of two public hospitals in Malaysia. Neonates with a gestational age greater than 34 weeks who were started on empiric antibiotics within 72 h of life were screened. The data were then stratified according to de-escalation and non-de-escalation practices, where de-escalation practice was defined as narrowing down or discontinuation of empiric antibiotic within 72 h of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 1045 neonates were screened, and 429 were included. The neonates were then divided based on de-escalation (n = 207) and non-de-escalation (n = 222) practices. Neonates under non-de-escalation practices showed significantly longer durations of antibiotic use compared to those under de-escalation practices (p < 0.05), with no difference in treatment outcomes. Five factors were found to be associated with de-escalation of antibiotics. They are cesarean section delivery, exposure to antenatal steroids, nil history of maternal pyrexia, absence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and normal C-reactive protein ≤ 0.5 mg/dL (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Empiric antibiotic de-escalation appears feasible as a routine form of treatment for EOS in late preterm and term neonates.","Ain Ibrahim, Nazedah; Makmor Bakry, Mohd; Mohd Tahir, Nurul Ain; Mohd Zaini, Nur Rashidah; Mohamed Shah, Noraida",Paediatr Drugs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222079/,60

The objective of the study was to evaluate the quality of evidence supporting the recommendations issued in CPGs for therapy, diagnosis, and prevention of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP). CPGs released by international scientific societies after year 2000, using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, were analyzed. Number and strength of recommendations and quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, and very low) were extracted and indexed in the aforementioned sections. High-quality evidence was based on randomized control trials (RCT) without important limitations and exceptionally on rigorous observational studies. Eighty recommendations were assessed, with 7 (8.7%), 24 (30.0%), 29 (36.3%), and 20 (25.0%) being supported by high, moderate, low, and very low-quality evidence, respectively. Highest evidence degree was reported for 26 prevention recommendations, with 7 (26.9%) supported by high-quality evidence and no recommendation based on very low-quality evidence. In contrast, among 9 recommendations for diagnosis and 45 for therapy, none was supported by high-quality evidence, in spite of being recommended as strong in 33.3% and 46.7%, respectively. Among HAP/VAP diagnosis recommendations, the majority of evidence was rated as low or very low-quality (55.6% and 22.2%, respectively) whereas among HAP/VAP therapy recommendations, 4/5 were rated as low and very low-quality (40% each). In conclusion, among HAP/VAP international guidelines, most recommendations, particularly in therapy, remain supported by observational studies, case reports, and expert opinion.

METHODS: From January 2014 to December 2018, 712 consecutive patients were enrolled in the study. These patients were divided into two groups according to whether or not needed postoperative CRRT: the CRRT group vs the control group. Univariate analysis and binary logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the risk factors of CRRT. To avoid the selection bias and confounders, baseline characteristics were matched for propensity scores. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to provide survival estimates at postoperative points in time. RESULTS: Before propensity score matching, univariate analysis showed that there were significant differences in age, preoperative hypertension, pericardial effusion, preoperative serum creatinine (sCr), intraoperative need for combined coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or mitral valve or tricuspid valve surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time, extracorporeal circulation assistant time, aortic cross-clamp time, drainage volume 24 h after surgery and ventilator time between two groups. All were higher in the CRRT group (P < 0.05). These risk factors were included in binary logistic regression. It showed that preoperative sCr and CPB time were independent risk factors for CRRT patients undergoing surgery for TA-AAD. And there were significant differences regarding 30-day mortality (P < 0.001) and long-term overall cumulative survival (P < 0.001) with up to a 6-year follow-up. After propensity scoring, 29 pairs (58 patients) were successfully matched. Among these patients, the analysis showed that CPB time was still significantly longer in the CRRT group (P = 0.004), and the 30-day mortality rate was also higher in this group (44.8% vs 10.3%; P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: CRRT after TA-AAD is common and worsened short- and long- term mortality. The preoperative sCr and CPB time are independent risk factors for postoperative CRRT patients. Shorten the CPB time as much as possible is recommended to reduce the risk of CRRT after the operation.","Wang, Zhigang; Ge, Min; Chen, Tao; Chen, Cheng; Zong, Qiuyan; Lu, Lichong; Wang, Dongjin",J Cardiothorac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7226713/,60

We introduced single disulfide bonds into NPC1 and NPC1L1 to explore the importance of inter-domain dynamics in cholesterol transport. Using a sensitive method to monitor lysosomal cholesterol efflux, we found that NPC1’s N-terminal domain need not release from the rest of the protein for efficient cholesterol export. Either introducing single disulfide bonds to constrain lumenal/extracellular domains or shortening a cytoplasmic loop abolishes transport activity by both NPC1 and NPC1L1. The widely prescribed cholesterol uptake inhibitor, ezetimibe, blocks NPC1L1; we show that residues that lie at the interface between NPC1L1's three extracellular domains comprise the drug’s binding site. These data support a model in which cholesterol passes through the cores of NPC1/NPC1L1 proteins; concerted movement of various domains is needed for transfer and ezetimibe blocks transport by binding to multiple domains simultaneously.","Saha, Piyali; Shumate, Justin L; Caldwell, Jenna G; Elghobashi-Meinhardt, Nadia; Lu, Albert; Zhang, Lichao; Olsson, Niclas E; Elias, Joshua E; Pfeffer, Suzanne R",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7228765/,60

However, recently, three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models have been heavily investigated as they provide better physiological relevance for studying various disease behaviors, cellular activity and pharmaceutical interactions. Typically, small-sized tumor spheroid models (100–500 μm) are used to study various biological and physicochemical activities. Larger, millimetric spheroid models are becoming more desirable for simulating native tumor microenvironments (TMEs). Here, we assess the use of ultra-large spheroid models (~2000 μm) generated from scaffolds made from a nozzle-free, ultra-high resolution printer; these models are explored for assessing chemotherapeutic responses with molecular doxorubicin (DOX) and two analogues of Doxil(Ⓡ) (Dox-NP(Ⓡ), Doxoves(TM)) on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines.

Analysis of both large and small MCF-7 spheroids revealed that Dox-NP tends to have the highest level of inhibition, followed by molecular doxorubicin and then Doxoves. The experimental advantages and drawbacks of using these types of ultra-large spheroids for cancer research are discussed.","Holub, Austin R.; Huo, Anderson; Patel, Kavil; Thakore, Vishal; Chhibber, Pranav; Erogbogbo, Folarin",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7352930/,60

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 88 practically healthy people living and working in the Arctic region were examined. An analysis of the results was carried out, depending on the concentration of lymphocytes in the peripheral venous blood: group 1—with lymphopenia, the content of lymphocytes below 1.5 × 10(9)cl/L (21 people); group 2—with a normal lymphocyte content from 1.5 to 3.5 × 10(9)cl/L (47 people); and group 3—with lymphocytosis, lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of more than 3.5 × 10(9)cl/L (20 people). RESULTS: It has been established that the main mechanism for the formation of lymphopenia in a person living in the Arctic is the activation of the migration of functionally active lymphocytes in the tissue. The decrease in the number of circulating lymphocytes is a consequence of their redistribution from the circulating pool to the marginal one and an increase in the activity of adhesive molecules, in particular, the selectin ligand. It was revealed that an increase in the content of lymphocytes in the blood occurs upon the activation of the intracellular energy‐intensive mechanisms of lymphoproliferation with an increase in the consumption of intracellular ATP and the participation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells 1. It was shown that the restoration of the circulating pool of mature neutrophils is ensured by the principle of reverse regulation in response to neutropenia by stimulating granulocyte‐colony stimulating factor granulopoiesis. CONCLUSIONS: The main mechanism for the formation of lymphopenia and lymphocytosis in healthy people was established.","Patrakeeva, Veronika P.; Dobrodeeva, Liliya K.",Immun Inflamm Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7416049/,60

The influence of three types of graphene family materials (GFM), i.e., graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and poly(ethylene glycol) grafted graphene oxide (GO-PEG), as well as hydroxyapatite (HAp) on the physicochemical and biological properties of the composite hydrogels was examined in view of their potential applicability as tissue engineering scaffolds. The substrates and the hydrogel samples were thoroughly characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, infrared spectroscopy, digital and scanning electron microscopy, rheological and mechanical analysis, in vitro chemical stability and bioactivity assays, as well as initial cytocompatibility evaluation with human umbilical cord Wharton’s jelly mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs). We followed the green-chemistry approach and avoided toxic cross-linking agents, using instead specific interactions of our polymer matrix with tannic acid, non-toxic physical cross-linker, and graphene derivatives. It was shown that the most promising are the gradient hydrogels modified with GO-PEG and HAp.","Kosowska, Karolina; Domalik-Pyzik, Patrycja; Sekuła-Stryjewska, Małgorzata; Noga, Sylwia; Jagiełło, Joanna; Baran, Magdalena; Lipińska, Ludwika; Zuba-Surma, Ewa; Chłopek, Jan",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7404139/,60

Here, as part of the mouse Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, we profiled 168 methylomes from 12 mouse tissues or organs at 9 developmental stages from embryogenesis to adulthood. We identified 1,808,810 genomic regions that showed variations in CG methylation by comparing the methylomes of different tissues or organs from different developmental stages. These DNA elements predominantly lose CG methylation during fetal development, whereas the trend is reversed after birth. During late stages of fetal development, non-CG methylation accumulated within the bodies of key developmental transcription factor genes, coinciding with their transcriptional repression. Integration of genome-wide DNA methylation, histone modification and chromatin accessibility data enabled us to predict 461,141 putative developmental tissue-specific enhancers, the human orthologues of which were enriched for disease-associated genetic variants. These spatiotemporal epigenome maps provide a resource for studies of gene regulation during tissue or organ progression, and a starting point for investigating regulatory elements that are involved in human developmental disorders.","He, Yupeng; Hariharan, Manoj; Gorkin, David U.; Dickel, Diane E.; Luo, Chongyuan; Castanon, Rosa G.; Nery, Joseph R.; Lee, Ah Young; Zhao, Yuan; Huang, Hui; Williams, Brian A.; Trout, Diane; Amrhein, Henry; Fang, Rongxin; Chen, Huaming; Li, Bin; Visel, Axel; Pennacchio, Len A.; Ren, Bing; Ecker, Joseph R.",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7398276/,60

METHODS: This was a multicentre prospective longitudinal study. Patients who met the Berlin definition of ARDS were included. Baseline data and data on ventilator management and the use of adjunct therapy were collected. RESULTS: Of the 18,793 patients admitted to participating ICUs during the study timeframe, 672 patients fulfilled the Berlin ARDS criteria and 527 patients were included in the analysis. The most common predisposing factor for ARDS in 402 (77.0) patients was pneumonia. The prevalence rates were 9.7% (51/527) for mild ARDS, 47.4% (250/527) for moderate ARDS, and 42.9% (226/527) for severe ARDS. In total, 400 (75.9%) patients were managed with invasive mechanical ventilation during their ICU stays. All ARDS patients received a tidal volume of 6.8 (5.8–7.9) mL/kg of their predicted body weight and a positive end-expository pressure (PEEP) of 8 (6–12) cmH(2)O. Recruitment manoeuvres (RMs) and prone positioning were used in 61 (15.3%) and 85 (16.1%) ventilated patients, respectively. Life-sustaining care was withdrawn from 92 (17.5%) patients. When these patients were included in the mortality analysis, 244 (46.3%) ARDS patients (16 (31.4%) with mild ARDS, 101 (40.4%) with moderate ARDS, and 127 (56.2%) with severe ARDS) died in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Among the 18 ICUs in mainland China, the incidence of ARDS was low. The rates of mortality and withdrawal of life-sustaining care were high. The recommended lung protective strategy was followed with a high degree of compliance, but the implementation of adjunct treatment was lacking. These findings indicate the potential for improvement in the management of patients with ARDS in China. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02975908.

Although NOA genes are acknowledged to be potential drug targets, there has been no large-scale attempt to identify and characterise them as a group across cancer types. Here we provide the first method for the identification of conditional NOA genes and their rewired neighbours using a systems approach. Using copy number data and expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) we performed comparative analyses between high and low genomic stress tumours for 15 cancer types. We identified 101 condition-specific differential coexpression modules, mapped to a high-confidence human interactome, comprising 133 candidate NOA rewiring hub genes. We observe that most modules lose coexpression in the high-stress state and that activated stress modules and hubs take part in homoeostasis maintenance processes such as chromosome segregation, oxireductase activity, mitotic checkpoint (PLK1 signalling), DNA replication initiation and synaptic signalling. We furthermore show that candidate NOA rewiring hubs are unique for each cancer type, but that their respective rewired neighbour genes largely are shared across cancer types.","Hjaltelin, Jessica Xin; Izarzugaza, Jose M.

Surveillance for respiratory diseases in domestic National Army and National Guard training camps began after the United States’ entry into World War I, 17 months before the “Spanish influenza” pandemic appeared. Methods. Morbidity, mortality, and case-fatality data from 605 625 admissions and 18 258 deaths recorded for 7 diagnostic categories of respiratory diseases, including influenza and pneumonia, were examined over prepandemic and pandemic periods. Results. High pandemic influenza mortality was primarily due to increased incidence of, but not increased severity of, secondary bacterial pneumonias. Conclusions. Two prepandemic incidence peaks of probable influenza, in December 1917–January 1918 and in March–April 1918, differed markedly from the September–October 1918 pandemic onset peak in their clinical-epidemiologic features, and they may have been caused by seasonal or endemic viruses. Nevertheless, rising proportions of very low incidence postinfluenza bronchopneumonia (diagnosed at the time as influenza and bronchopneumonia) in early 1918 could have reflected circulation of the pandemic virus 5 months before it emerged in pandemic form. In this study, we discuss the possibility of detecting pandemic viruses before they emerge, by surveillance of special populations.","Chertow, Daniel S.; Cai, Rongman; Sun, Junfeng; Grantham, John; Taubenberger, Jeffery K.; Morens, David M.",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4506031/,60

To detect the ORF3 protein, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated in this study. The mAb 7D3 binds to the ORF3 peptide (residues 35–66) and the native ORF3 protein in PCV2-infected PBMCs, as shown by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The data show that 3–5% of PBMCs were positive for ORF3 protein or p53 protein. Further, 78–82% of PBMCs were positive for the capsid. This study confirmed the ORF3 protein not only colocalized with the capsid protein but also colocalized with the p53 protein in PBMCs. Immunoassays were conducted in this study to detect the capsid protein, the ORF3 protein, anti-capsid IgG, and anti-ORF3 IgG. The data show the correlation (r = 0.758) of the ORF3 protein and the capsid protein in the blood samples from the PCV2-infected herd.

However, whether the new AR binding partner phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) in granulosa cells (GCs) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of PCOS remains unclear. METHODS: We identified the new AR binding partner PGK1 by co-IP (co-immunoprecipitation) in luteinized GCs, and reconfirmed by co-IP, co-localization and GST pull down assay, and checked PGK1 expression levels with qRT-PCR and western blotting. Pharmaceuticals rescue assays in mice, and metabolism assay, AR protein stability and RNA-seq of PGK1 targets in cells proved the function in PCOS. FINDINGS: PGK1 and AR are highly expressed in PCOS luteinized GCs and PCOS-like mouse ovarian tissues. PGK1 regulated glucose metabolism and deteriorated PCOS-like mouse metabolic disorder, and paclitaxel rescued the phenotype of PCOS-like mice and reduced ovarian PGK1 and AR protein levels. PGK1 inhibited AR ubiquitination levels and increased AR stability in an E3 ligase SKP2-dependent manner. Additionally, PGK1 promoted AR nuclear translocation, and RNA-seq data showed that critical ovulation-related genes were regulated by the PGK1-AR axis. INTERPRETATION: PGK1 regulated GCs metabolism and interacted with AR to regulate the expression of key ovulation genes, and also mediated cell proliferation and apoptosis, which resulted in the etiology of PCOS.

Cannabidiol (CBD), the non-psychoactive compound isolated from cannabis plants, was recently approved for treatment of two types of epilepsy associated with sodium channel mutations. This study used high-resolution X-ray crystallography to demonstrate the detailed nature of the interactions between CBD and the NavMs voltage-gated sodium channel, and electrophysiology to show the functional effects of binding CBD to these channels. CBD binds at a novel site at the interface of the fenestrations and the central hydrophobic cavity of the channel. Binding at this site blocks the transmembrane-spanning sodium ion translocation pathway, providing a molecular mechanism for channel inhibition. Modelling studies suggest why the closely-related psychoactive compound tetrahydrocannabinol may not have the same effects on these channels. Finally, comparisons are made with the TRPV2 channel, also recently proposed as a target site for CBD. In summary, this study provides novel insight into a possible mechanism for CBD interactions with sodium channels.","Sait, Lily Goodyer; Sula, Altin; Ghovanloo, Mohammad-Reza; Hollingworth, David; Ruben, Peter C; Wallace, BA",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7641581/,60

Objective To evaluate the chemical constituents and effects of QMY on ASO rabbit model. Materials and methods Forty-eight New Zealand rabbits were divided into six groups (n = 8): normal (normal rabbits treated with 0.5% CMC-Na), vehicle (ASO rabbits treated with 0.5% CMC-Na), positive (simvastatin, 1.53 mg/kg), and QMY treatment (300, 600, and 1200 mg/kg). ASO rabbit model was prepared by high fatty feeding, roundly shortening artery, and bovine serum albumin immune injury. QMY (300, 600 and 1200 mg/kg) was orally administered for 8 weeks. The effects and possible mechanisms of QMY on ASO rabbits were evaluated by pathological examination, biochemical assays, and immunohistochemical assays. The compositions of QMY were analysed using HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis. Results Compared to the vehicle rabbit, QMY treatment suppressed plaque formation and intima thickness in aorta, and decreased intima thickness, whereas increased lumen area of femoral artery. Additionally, QMY treatment decreased TC, TG and LDL, decreased CRP and ET, and increased NO and 6-K-PGF1α in serum. Furthermore, the potential mechanisms studied revealed that QMY treatment could suppress expression of TNF-α, IL-6, ICAM-1 and NF-κB in endothelial tissues, and increase IκB. In addition, HPLC analysis showed QMY had abundant anthraquinones, stilbenes, and flavonoids. Conclusion QMY has ameliorative effects on ASO rabbit, and the potential mechanisms are correlated to reducing inflammation and down-regulating NF-κB.

15095,Shotgun drug repurposing biotechnology to tackle epidemics and pandemics,2020-05-04,"During the current COVID-19 pandemic more than 160,000 people have died worldwide as of mid-April 2020, and the global economy has been crippled. Effective control of the SARS-CoV2 virus that causes the COVID-19 pandemic requires both vaccines and antivirals. Antivirals are particularly crucial to treat infected people during the period of time that an effective vaccine is being developed and deployed. Because the development of specific antiviral drugs can take a considerable length of time, an important approach is to identify existing drugs already approved for use in humans which could be repurposed as COVID-19 therapeutics. Here we focus on antivirals directed against the SARS-CoV2 M(pro) protease, which is required for virus replication. A structural similarity search showed that the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease has a striking three-dimensional structural similarity to the SARS-CoV2 M(pro) protease, particularly in the arrangement of key active site residues. We used virtual docking predictions to assess the hypothesis that existing drugs already approved for human use or clinical testing that are directed at the HCV NS3/4A protease might fit well into the active-site cleft of the SARS-CoV2 protease (M(pro)). AutoDock docking scores for 12 HCV protease inhibitors and 9 HIV-1 protease inhibitors were determined and compared to the docking scores for an α-ketoamide inhibitor of M(pro), which has recently been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV2 virus replication in cell culture. We identified eight HCV protease inhibitors that bound to the M(pro) active site with higher docking scores than the α-ketoamide inhibitor, suggesting that these protease inhibitors may effectively bind to the M(pro) active site. These results provide the rationale for us to test the identified HCV protease inhibitors as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV2 protease, and as inhibitors of SARS-CoV2 virus replication. Subsequently these repurposed drugs could be evaluated as COVID-19 therapeutics.","Bafna, Khushboo; Krug, Robert M.; Montelione, Gaetano T.",ChemRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7263768/,60

15268,A recombinase polymerase amplification assay for rapid detection of rabies virus,2021-02-04,"Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) are generally unable to cross species barriers, in part because prolonged coevolution with one host species limits their ability to evade restriction factors in other species. However, the limitation in host range is incomplete. For example, rhesus CMV (RhCMV) can replicate in human cells, albeit much less efficiently than in rhesus cells. Previously we reported that the protein kinase R (PKR) antagonist encoded by RhCMV, rTRS1, has limited activity against human PKR but is nonetheless necessary and sufficient to enable RhCMV replication in human fibroblasts (HF). We now show that knockout of PKR in human cells or treatment with the eIF2B agonist ISRIB, which overcomes the translational inhibition resulting from PKR activation, augments RhCMV replication in HF, indicating that human PKR contributes to the inefficiency of RhCMV replication in HF. Serial passage of RhCMV in HF reproducibly selected for viruses with improved ability to replicate in human cells. The evolved viruses contain an inverted duplication of the terminal 6.8 kb of the genome, including rTRS1. The duplication replaces ~11.8 kb just downstream of an internal sequence element, pac1-like, which is very similar to the pac1 cleavage and packaging signal found near the terminus of the genome. Plaque-purified evolved viruses produced at least twice as much rTRS1 as the parental RhCMV and blocked the PKR pathway more effectively in HF. Southern blots revealed that unlike the parental RhCMV, viruses with the inverted duplication isomerize in a manner similar to HCMV and other herpesviruses that have internal repeat sequences. The apparent ease with which this duplication event occurs raises the possibility that the pac1-like site, which is conserved in Old World monkey CMV genomes, may serve a function in facilitating rapid adaptation to evolutionary obstacles.","Child, Stephanie J.; Greninger, Alexander L.; Geballe, Adam P.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7864422/,60
15489,pH-dependent and dynamic interactions of cystatin C with heparan sulfate,2021-02-12,"BACKGROUND: Therapeutic antibodies targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis induce potent and durable anti-tumor responses in multiple types of cancers. However, only a subset of patients benefits from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. As a negative regulator of anti-tumor immunity, TGF-β impairs the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and induces drug resistance. Developing a novel treatment strategy to simultaneously block PD-1/PD-L1 and TGF-β would be valuable to enhance the effect of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and relieve drug resistance. METHODS: Based on the Check-BODY™ technology platform, we developed an anti-TGF-β/PD-L1 bispecific antibody YM101. The bioactivity of the anti-TGF-β moiety was determined by Smad-luciferase reporter assay, transwell assay, western blotting, CCK-8, and flow cytometry. The bioactivity of the anti-PD-L1 moiety was measured by T cell activation assays. EMT-6, CT26, and 3LL tumor models were used to investigate the anti-tumor activity of YM101 in vivo. RNA-seq, immunohistochemical staining, and flow cytometry were utilized to analyze the effect of YM101 on the tumor microenvironment. RESULTS: YM101 could bind to TGF-β and PD-L1 specifically. In vitro experiments showed that YM101 effectively counteracted the biological effects of TGF-β and PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, including activating Smad signaling, inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and immunosuppression. Besides, in vivo experiments indicated the anti-tumor activity of YM101 was superior to anti-TGF-β and anti-PD-L1 monotherapies. Mechanistically, YM101 promoted the formation of ‘hot tumor’: increasing the numbers of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and dendritic cells, elevating the ratio of M1/M2, and enhancing cytokine production in T cells. This normalized tumor immune microenvironment and enhanced anti-tumor immune response might contribute to the robust anti-tumor effect of YM101. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that YM101 could simultaneously block TGF-β and PD-L1 pathways and had a superior anti-tumor effect compared to the monotherapies.","Yi, Ming; Zhang, Jing; Li, Anping; Niu, Mengke; Yan, Yongxiang; Jiao, Ying; Luo, Suxia; Zhou, Pengfei; Wu, Kongming",J Hematol Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7885589/,60

In the absence of vaccines or effective treatments, a better characterization of the pathogenesis of RSV infection is required. To date, the pathophysiology of the disease and its diagnosis has mostly relied on chest X-ray and genome detection in nasopharyngeal swabs. The development of new imaging approaches is instrumental to further the description of RSV spread, virus–host interactions and related acute respiratory disease, at the level of the entire lung. Methods: By combining tissue clearing, 3D microscopy and image processing, we developed a novel visualization tool of RSV infection in undissected mouse lungs. Results: Whole tissue analysis allowed the identification of infected cell subtypes, based on both morphological traits and position within the cellular network. Furthermore, 3D imaging was also valuable to detect the cytoplasmic viral factories, also called inclusion bodies, a hallmark of RSV infection. Conclusions: Whole lung clearing and 3D deep imaging represents an unprecedented visualization method of infected lungs to allow insight into RSV pathophysiology and improve the 2D histology analyses.","Frétaud, Maxence; Descamps, Delphyne; Laubreton, Daphné; Rameix-Welti, Marie-Anne; Eléouët, Jean-François; Larcher, Thibaut; Galloux, Marie; Langevin, Christelle",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7912480/,60

As in many other European countries attendance had a U-shaped development with the lowest numbers in the mid-1980s. The developments in the Netherlands do not seem to have been affected by hooliganism but by socioeconomic factors. Furthermore, the association with stadium attendance in other European leagues in particular the English Premier League is very high. This suggests that stadium attendance is affected not only by national developments but also by common international trends in the interest in football matches.","van Ours, Jan C.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7928532/,60
16165,Immunoinformatics Design of Multi-Epitope Peptide-Based Vaccine Against Schistosoma mansoni Using Transmembrane Proteins as a Target,2021-03-02,"Consumer-based physical activity (PA) trackers, also known as wearables, are increasingly being used in research studies as intervention or measurement tools. One of the most popular and widely used brands of PA trackers is Fitbit. Since the release of the first Fitbit in 2009, hundreds of experimental studies have used Fitbit devices to facilitate PA self-monitoring and behavior change via goal setting and feedback tools. Fitbit’s ability to capture large volumes of PA and physiological data in real time creates enormous opportunities for researchers. At the same time, however, it introduces a number of challenges (eg, technological, operational, logistical), most of which are not sufficiently described in study publications. Currently, there are no technical reports, guidelines, nor other types of publications discussing some of these challenges and offering guidance to researchers on how to best incorporate Fitbit devices in their study design and intervention to achieve their research goals. As a result, researchers are often left alone to discover and address some of these issues during the study through “trial and error.” This paper aims to address this gap. Drawing on our cumulative experience of conducting multiple studies with various Fitbit PA trackers over the years, we present and discuss various key challenges associated with the use of Fitbit PA trackers in research studies. Difficulties with the use of Fitbit PA trackers are encountered throughout the entire research process. Challenges and solutions are categorized in 4 main categories: study preparation, intervention delivery, data collection and analysis, and study closeout. Subsequently, we describe a number of empirically tested strategies used in 4 of our interventional studies involving participants from a broad range of demographic characteristics, racial/ethnic backgrounds, and literacy levels. Researchers should be prepared to address challenges and issues in a timely fashion to ensure that the Fitbit effectively assists participants and researchers in achieving research and outcome goals.","Balbim, Guilherme M; Marques, Isabela G; Marquez, David X; Patel, Darshilmukesh; Sharp, Lisa K; Kitsiou, Spyros; Nyenhuis, Sharmilee M",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7961407/,60

The main treatment is chemotherapy (Ch). However, the addition of radiotherapy significantly improves overall survival (OS) in patients with non-metastatic SCLC and in those with metastatic SCLC who respond to Ch. Prophylactic cranial irradiation reduces the risk of brain metastases and improves OS in both metastatic and non-metastatic patients. The 5-year OS rate in patients with limited-stage disease (non-metastatic) is slightly higher than 30%, but less than 5% in patients with extensive-stage disease (metastatic). The present clinical guidelines were developed by Spanish radiation oncologists on behalf of the Oncologic Group for the Study of Lung Cancer/Spanish Society of Radiation Oncology to provide a current review of the diagnosis, planning, and treatment of SCLC. These guidelines emphasise treatment fields, radiation techniques, fractionation, concomitant treatment, and the optimal timing of Ch and radiotherapy.

The study presents the case of a 31-year-old Caucasian female whose recurrent hypoglycemia symptoms were the reason for further diagnostics. The final results revealed a positive test for insulin autoantibody and glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody. Therefore, not only the potential causes of hypoglycemia but also an active autoimmune process typical for latent autoimmune diabetes in adults were confirmed. It was concluded that autoimmune hypoglycemia can be a part of the autoimmune process associated with diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults.","Sutkowska, Edyta; Ostrowska, Malgorzata; Sutkowska, Magdalena",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8043793/,60

The objective of this study was to determine the incidence, risk factors, and mortality attributable to CRBSIs in those patients. METHODS: A population-based surveillance on suspected CRBSI was conducted from 2009 to 2018 in a tertiary care hospital in China. We used the results of catheter tip culture to identify patients with suspected CRBSIs. Demographics, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, interventions, and microorganism culture results were analysed and compared between patients with and without confirmed CRBSIs. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified the risk factors for CRBSIs, and attributable mortality was evaluated with a time-varying Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: In total, 686 patients with 795 episodes of suspected CRBSIs were included; 19.2% (153/795) episodes were confirmed as CRBSIs, and 17.4% (119/686) patients died within 30 days. The multifactor model shows that CRBSIs were associated with fever, hypotension, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hyperglycaemia and the use of continuous renal replacement therapy. The AUC was 77.0% (95% CI 73.3%–80.7%). The population attributable mortality fraction of CRBSI in patients was 18.2%, and mortality rate did not differ significantly between patients with and without CRBSIs (95% CI 0.464–1.279, P = 0.312). CONCLUSIONS: This initial model based on the SIRS criteria is relatively better at identifying patients with CRBSI but only in domains of the sensitivity. There were no significant differences in attributable mortality due to CRBSI and other causes in patients with suspected CRBSI, which prompt catheter removal and re-insertion of new catheter may not benefit patients with suspected CRBSIs.

16939,CB(1)-receptor-mediated inhibitory LTD triggers presynaptic remodeling via protein synthesis and ubiquitination,2020-09-09,"The burden of chronic disease in Europe continues to grow. A major challenge facing national governments is how to tackle the risk factors of sedentary lifestyle, alcohol abuse, smoking, and unhealthy diet. These factors are complex and necessitate intersectoral collaboration to strengthen health promotion, counter-act the social determinants of health, and reduce the prevalence of chronic disease. European countries have diverse intersectoral collaboration to encourage health promotion activities. In the Joint Action CHRODIS-PLUS success factors for intersectoral collaboration within and outside healthcare which strengthen health promotion activities were identified with a mixed method design via a survey of 22 project partners in 14 countries and 2 workshops. In six semi-structured interviews, the mechanisms underlying these success factors were examined. These mechanisms can be very context-specific but do give more insight into how they can be replicated. In this paper, 20 health promotion interventions from national programs in CHRODIS PLUS are explored. This includes community interventions, policy actions, integrated approaches, capacity building, and training activities. The interventions involved collaboration across three to more than six sectors. The conclusion is a set of seven recommendations that are considered to be essential for fostering intersectoral collaboration to improve health-promoting activities.","van Dale, Djoeke; Lemmens, Lidwien; Hendriksen, Marieke; Savolainen, Nella; Nagy, Péter; Marosi, Edit; Eigenmann, Michela; Stegemann, Ingrid; Rogers, Heather L.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7557573/,60

However, little is known about the impact of climate change on human health and effective adaptation methods in informal settlements in low- and middle-income countries. Objective: The objective of this scoping review was to identify, characterize, and summarize research evidence on the impact of climate change on human health in informal settlements and the available adaptation methods and interventions. Method: A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O’Malley framework. The four bibliographic databases PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched. Eligibility criteria were all types of peer-reviewed publications reporting on climate change or related extreme weather events (as defined by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), informal settlements (as defined by UN-Habitat), low- and middle-income countries (as defined by the World Bank) and immediate human health impacts. Review selection and characterization were performed by two independent reviewers using a predefined form. Results: Out of 1197 studies initially identified, 15 articles were retained. We found nine original research articles, and six reviews, commentaries, and editorials. The articles were reporting on the exposures flooding, temperature changes and perceptions of climate change with health outcomes broadly categorized as mental health, communicable diseases, and non-communicable diseases. Six studies had a geographical focus on Asia, four on Africa, and one on South America, the remaining four articles had no geographical focus. One article investigated an adaptation method for heat exposure. Serval other adaptation methods were proposed, though they were not investigated by the articles in this review. Conclusion: There is a paucity of original research and solid study designs. Further studies are needed to improve the understanding of the impact, the most effective adaptation methods and to inform policy making.","Borg, Frederikke Højgaard; Greibe Andersen, Johanne; Karekezi, Catherine; Yonga, Gerald; Furu, Peter; Kallestrup, Per; Kraef, Christian",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8049459/,60
17034,Melatonin Inhibits Dengue Virus Infection via the Sirtuin 1-Mediated Interferon Pathway,2021-04-11,"Background and Objectives: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains a worldwide management problem. Although there is a general effort for characterizing this population, few studies have assessed the predictive value of the echocardiographic E/e’ ratio in patients with acute HFpEF. The aim of the study was to identify groups with different prognosis in patients hospitalized with a first acute episode of HFpEF. Materials and Methods: The primary endpoint of the study was heart failure readmissions (HFR) at 6 months, while the secondary outcome was six-month mortality. We consecutively enrolled 91 patients hospitalized for the first time with acute HFpEF. We examined the E/e’ ratio as an independent predictor for HFR using univariate regression. Results: We identified and validated the E/e’ ratio as an independent predictor for HFR. An E/e’ ratio threshold value of 13.80 was calculated [(area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.693, sensitivity = 78.60%, specificity = 55%, p < 0.004)] and validated as an inflection point for an increased number of HFR. Thus, we divided the study cohort into two groups: group 1 with an E/e’ ratio < 13.80 (n = 39) and group 2 with an E/e’ ratio > 13.80 (n = 49). Compared to group 1, group 2 had an increased number of HFR (p = 0.003) and a shorter time to first HFR (p = 0.002). However, this parameter did not influence all-cause mortality within six months (p = 0.84). Conclusions: The dimensionless E/e’ ratio is a useful discriminator between patients with acute HFpEF. An E/e’ value over 13.80 represents a simple, yet effective instrument for assessing the HFR risk. However, all-cause mortality at six months is not influenced by the E/e’ ratio.","Zamfirescu, Marilena-Brîndușa; Ghilencea, Liviu-Nicolae; Popescu, Mihaela-Roxana; Bejan, Gabriel Cristian; Maher, Sean Martin; Popescu, Andreea-Catarina; Dorobanțu, Maria",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8070491/,60

In many ways, America’s history is a history of protest, but its history also shows the power and potential of demonstrations and dialogue to lead to broad coalitions for policy and public health action. The U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is one example that illustrates the collective power of demonstration and dialogue. To achieve the level of public support needed for meaningful and sustainable responses to major public health challenges, integrative policy negotiation should become a core public health competency. We have developed a series of hypothetical case-based role plays to practice integrative policy negotiation in the context of public health policy advocacy in a hypothetical country called Countryland. These tools are included as appendices and are free to use and adapt.

17431,Accelerated Evolution of H7N9 Subtype Influenza Virus under Vaccination Pressure,2021-05-11,"BACKGROUND: Alemtuzumab is a T cell depleting antibody agent used as induction immunosuppressant therapy in solid organ transplant recipients. In addition, it is being increasingly used to treat severe or glucocorticoid-resistant graft rejection. Despite the effectiveness of the treatment, severe adverse events have been reported related to alemtuzumab administration. We present a similar event illustrating the severity of this adverse drug reaction (ADR) and we highlight the structure causality assessment provides in approaching such a case. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of life-threatening respiratory failure after alemtuzumab administration in a 17 year old paediatric kidney transplant recipient. He developed near fatal severe respiratory and circulatory failure based on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with diffuse alveolar oedema and haemoptysis hours after his second alemtuzumab administration. As it was questionable whether alemtuzumab could be regarded as the origin of his reaction and in order to assess the causality of this reaction as well as to structure clinical reasoning, we applied a widely used ADR probability scale to systematically review our case. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our case shows a severe ADR after alemtuzumab administration. It illustrates the importance of proper causality assessment, the structure it provides and the benefit of a clinical pharmacology consultation when a severe reaction is suspected to be an ADR. By taking our case as an example, we demonstrate the added value of structured causality assessment to clinical reasoning and in generating differential diagnoses.","Smeets, Nori J. L.; Eijk, Ruud J.

Further, each breed was differentiated using multivariate analyses, including a machine learning algorithm designed to use metabolic information from each type of chicken obtained using (1)H-(13)C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (2D NMR). Breast meat from KNC-D chickens were superior to those of conventional KNC-H and WSB chickens in terms of both taste-active and bioactive compounds. In the multivariate analysis, meat portions (breast and thigh) and chicken breeds (KNCs and WSB) could be clearly distinguished based on the outcomes of the principal component analysis and partial least square-discriminant analysis (R(2)=0.945; Q(2)=0.901). Based on this, we determined the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for each of these components. AUC analysis identified 10 features which could be consistently applied to distinguish between all KNCs and WSB chickens in both breast (0.988) and thigh (1.000) meat without error. Here, both (1)H NMR and 2D NMR could successfully quantify various target metabolites which could be used to distinguish between different chicken breeds based on their metabolic profile.","Kim, Hyun Cheol; Yim, Dong-Gyun; Kim, Ji Won; Lee, Dongheon; Jo, Cheorun",Food Sci Anim Resour,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8115009/,60

The virus causes multiple epithelial tumors on the fish’s skin and fins that are liable for more than 50% of the mortality rate of fish around the world. Till now, no effective antiviral drug or vaccine candidates have been developed that can block the progression of the disease caused by the pathogen. It was found that the 582-amino-acid (aa) residues long internal structural gag polyprotein of the virus plays an important role in virus budding and virion maturation outside of the cell. Inhibition of the protein can block the budding and virion maturation process and can be developed as an antiviral drug candidate against the virus. Therefore, the study aimed to identify potential natural antiviral drug candidates from the tropical mangrove marine plant Avicennia alba, which will be able to block the budding and virion maturation process by inhibiting the activity of the gag protein of the virus. Initially, a homology modeling approach was applied to identify the 3D structure, followed by refinement and validation of the protein. The refined protein structures were then utilized for molecular docking simulation. Eleven phytochemical compounds have been isolated from the marine plant and docked against the virus gag polyprotein. Three compounds, namely Friedlein (CID244297), Phytosterols (CID12303662), and 1-Triacontanol (CID68972) have been selected based on their docking score −8.5 kcal/mol, −8.0 kcal/mol and −7.9 kcal/mol, respectively, and were evaluated through ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion), and toxicity properties. Finally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was applied to confirm the binding stability of the protein-ligands complex structure. The ADME and toxicity analysis reveal the efficacy and non-toxic properties of the compounds, where MD simulation confirmed the binding stability of the selected three compounds with the targeted protein. This computational study revealed the virtuous value of the selected three compounds against the targeted gag polyprotein and will be effective and promising antiviral candidates against the pathogen in a significant and worthwhile manner. Although in vitro and in vivo study is required for further evaluation of the compounds against the targeted protein.","Aljahdali, Mohammed Othman; Molla, Mohammad Habibur Rahman; Ahammad, Foysal",Mar Drugs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8145693/,60

In this study, we re-isolated the WUXV from wild sandflies collected from two villages in Yangquan County, China in 2019. Four virus isolates that caused cytopathic effects in BHK-21 cells were successfully isolated from sandfly specimens collected from chicken pens and sheep pens. Phylogenetic analyses of the L, M and S gene segments of the viruses revealed that the four virus strains represented the previously isolated WUXV. The minimum infection rate (MIR) of the virus isolated from the sheep pen was 3.21, and the MIR of the virus isolated from the chicken pen was 3.45. The positive rates of Wuxiang virus neutralizing antibodies in serum samples of local healthy people and domestic chickens were 8.7% (4/46) and 100% (4/4), respectively, suggesting that Wuxiang virus can infect human and animal.

Current influenza diagnosis and treatment relies upon patient visits to healthcare facilities, which may lead to under‐diagnosis and treatment delays. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of an at‐home approach to influenza diagnosis and treatment via home testing, telehealth care, and rapid antiviral home delivery. METHODS: We conducted a pilot interventional study of remote influenza diagnosis and treatment in Seattle‐area households with children during the 2019‐2020 influenza season using pre‐positioned nasal swabs and home influenza tests. Home monitoring for respiratory symptoms occurred weekly; if symptoms were reported within 48 hours of onset, participants collected mid‐nasal swabs and used a rapid home‐based influenza immunoassay. An additional home‐collected swab was returned to a laboratory for confirmatory influenza RT‐PCR testing. Baloxavir antiviral treatment was prescribed and delivered to symptomatic and age‐eligible participants, following a telehealth encounter. RESULTS: 124 households comprising 481 individuals self‐monitored for respiratory symptoms, with 58 home tests administered. 12 home tests were positive for influenza, of which eight were true positives confirmed by RT‐PCR. The sensitivity and specificity of the home influenza test were 72.7% and 96.2%, respectively. There were eight home deliveries of baloxavir, with 7 (87.5%) occurring within 3 hours of prescription and all within 48 hours of symptom onset.

18486,Inhibition of Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase by Pictilisib Blocks Influenza Virus Propagation in Cells and in Lungs of Infected Mice,2021-05-29,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinopathy. Nevertheless, non-genetic biological factors play a central role in its pathogenesis and progression, including inflammation, autophagy and oxidative stress. The retina is particularly affected by oxidative stress due to its high metabolic rate and oxygen consumption as well as photosensitizer molecules inside the photoreceptors being constantly subjected to light/oxidative stress, which induces accumulation of ROS in RPE, caused by damaged photoreceptor’s daily recycling. Oxidative DNA damage is a key regulator of microglial activation and photoreceptor degeneration in RP, as well as mutations in endogenous antioxidant pathways involved in DNA repair, oxidative stress protection and activation of antioxidant enzymes (MUTYH, CERKL and GLO1 genes, respectively). Moreover, exposure to oxidative stress alters the expression of micro-RNA (miRNAs) and of long non-codingRNA (lncRNAs), which might be implicated in RP etiopathogenesis and progression, modifying gene expression and cellular response to oxidative stress. The upregulation of the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) also seems to be involved, causing pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS release by macrophages and microglia, contributing to neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative progression in RP. The multiple pathways analysed demonstrate that oxidative microglial activation may trigger the vicious cycle of non-resolved neuroinflammation and degeneration, suggesting that microglia may be a key therapy target of oxidative stress in RP.","Gallenga, Carla Enrica; Lonardi, Maria; Pacetti, Sofia; Violanti, Sara Silvia; Tassinari, Paolo; Di Virgilio, Francesco; Tognon, Mauro; Perri, Paolo",Antioxidants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8229325/,60

Addressing SDOH in a healthcare setting can improve care, patient experience, health outcomes, and decrease cost. Therefore, screening for SODH in the pediatric setting has become an essential and evidence-based component of pediatric preventative care. Multiple barriers exist for its implementation, particularly for trainees. METHODS: Using resident-driven quality improvement (QI) methodology, we aimed to increase SDOH screening to >90% for 9 individual questions at newborn and 1-year well visits and completely screen for all 9 questions at more than 40% of visits. Parents were provided with a paper screening form upon arrival to be completed before visits. We performed tests of change to improve distribution, documentation, and quality of interventions. RESULTS: The primary outcome of complete screening for all 9 questions increased from 24% to 43% at newborn visits and 28% to 83% at 1-year visits. Screenings that identified at least 1 need increased from 8% to 19%, with provider response to an identified need increasing from 20% to 40%. These metrics were the secondary outcome measures.

19244,Development of a human antibody fragment directed against the alpha folate receptor as a promising molecule for targeted application,2021-07-08,"This study aimed to enhance the quality of broiler breast meat by adding pig skin collagen to feed. A total of 50 Ross 308 broilers were classified according to the following feeding regime for two weeks: basal diet (NC), basal diet+0.1% fish collagen (PC), basal diet+0.1% pig skin collagen (T1), basal diet+0.5% pig skin collagen (T2), and basal diet+1.0% pig skin collagen (T3). The moisture content was the highest in the PC group, and the protein content was the lowest in the T1 group (p<0.05). The fat content was higher in the T1 and PC groups, whereas the ash content was higher in the T3 group (p<0.05). Drip loss was the highest in the NC group and the lowest in the T2 group (p<0.05). Lightness was low in groups T2 and T3, redness was low in groups T2 and PC, and yellowness was low in groups T1, T2, and PC (p<0.05). The collagen content of the chicken breast was the highest in the T3 group, and that of the skin was the highest in the T1 group (p<0.05). The texture characteristics of springiness, cohesiveness, chewiness, and hardness were the highest in the T3 group (p<0.05). In conclusion, the supplementation of a broiler diet with pig skin collagen was found to increase the collagen content of the breast meat, indicating the improved quality of the broiler breast meat.","Park, Sanghun; Kim, Yun-a; Lee, Sanghun; Park, Yunhwan; Kim, Nahee; Choi, Jungseok",Food Sci Anim Resour,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8277177/,60
19431,Differential Diagnosis for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus Using Nanoparticles Expressing Chemiluminescence,2021-06-30,"Whilst randomised control trials are undoubtedly the best way to demonstrate whether plasma exchange or infusion alone is the best first-line treatment for patients with atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), individual case reports can provide valuable information. To that effect, we have had the unique opportunity to follow over a 10-year period three sisters with aHUS associated with a factor H mutation (CFH). Two of the sisters are monozygotic twins. A similar natural evolution and response to treatment would be expected for the three patients, as they all presented with the same at-risk polymorphisms for CFH and CD46 and no identifiable mutation in either CD46 or CFI. Our report of different modalities of treatment of the initial episode and of three transplantations and relapses in the transplant in two of them, strongly suggest that intensive plasma exchange, both acutely and prophylactically, can maintain the long-term function of both native kidneys and allografts. In our experience, the success of plasma therapy is dependent on the use of plasma exchange as opposed to plasma infusion alone, the prolongation of daily plasma exchange after normalisation of haematological parameters followed by prophylactic plasma exchange, the use of prophylactic plasma exchange prior to transplantation and the use of prophylactic plasma exchange at least once a week posttransplant with immediate intensification of treatment if there are any signs of recurrence.","Davin, Jean Claude; Strain, Lisa; Goodship, Tim H.

19473,"Method for safe Verres needle entry at the umbilicus, with modification for first trocar entry to reduce the complication rate of first entry",2021-04-09,"BACKGROUND: There is an unmet need for noninvasive imaging markers that can help identify the aggressive subtype(s) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) at diagnosis and at an earlier time point, and evaluate the efficacy of therapy prior to tumor reduction. In the past few years, there have been two major developments with potential for a significant impact in establishing imaging biomarkers for PDAC and pancreatic cancer premalignancy: (1) hyperpolarized metabolic (HP)-magnetic resonance (MR), which increases the sensitivity of conventional MR by over 10,000-fold, enabling real-time metabolic measurements; and (2) applications of artificial intelligence (AI). OBJECTIVE: Our objective of this review was to discuss these two exciting but independent developments (HP-MR and AI) in the realm of PDAC imaging and detection from the available literature to date. METHODS: A systematic review following the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines was performed. Studies addressing the utilization of HP-MR and/or AI for early detection, assessment of aggressiveness, and interrogating the early efficacy of therapy in patients with PDAC cited in recent clinical guidelines were extracted from the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. The studies were reviewed following predefined exclusion and inclusion criteria, and grouped based on the utilization of HP-MR and/or AI in PDAC diagnosis. RESULTS: Part of the goal of this review was to highlight the knowledge gap of early detection in pancreatic cancer by any imaging modality, and to emphasize how AI and HP-MR can address this critical gap. We reviewed every paper published on HP-MR applications in PDAC, including six preclinical studies and one clinical trial. We also reviewed several HP-MR–related articles describing new probes with many functional applications in PDAC. On the AI side, we reviewed all existing papers that met our inclusion criteria on AI applications for evaluating computed tomography (CT) and MR images in PDAC. With the emergence of AI and its unique capability to learn across multimodal data, along with sensitive metabolic imaging using HP-MR, this knowledge gap in PDAC can be adequately addressed. CT is an accessible and widespread imaging modality worldwide as it is affordable; because of this reason alone, most of the data discussed are based on CT imaging datasets. Although there were relatively few MR-related papers included in this review, we believe that with rapid adoption of MR imaging and HP-MR, more clinical data on pancreatic cancer imaging will be available in the near future. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of AI, HP-MR, and multimodal imaging information in pancreatic cancer may lead to the development of real-time biomarkers of early detection, assessing aggressiveness, and interrogating early efficacy of therapy in PDAC.","Enriquez, José S; Chu, Yan; Pudakalakatti, Shivanand; Hsieh, Kang Lin; Salmon, Duncan; Dutta, Prasanta; Millward, Niki Zacharias; Lurie, Eugene; Millward, Steven; McAllister, Florencia; Maitra, Anirban; Sen, Subrata; Killary, Ann; Zhang, Jian; Jiang, Xiaoqian; Bhattacharya, Pratip K; Shams, Shayan",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8277399/,60

19751,Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies for HIV-1 Prevention,2021-07-20,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a fatal inflammatory response syndrome. LncRNA XIST (XIST) is a lung cancer-related gene and participates in pneumonia. However, whether XIST participates in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced ALI remains unclear. LPS-induced inflammation model was constructed in vitro, then cell viability, cytokines, cell apoptosis, protein, and mRNA expressions were individually detected by cell counting kit-8, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry, Western blot, and qRT-PCR. A dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed the relationships among XIST, miR-132-3p, and MAPK14. Furthermore, inflammation and conditions after knockdown of XIST were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents using LPS-induced in vivo model. Our findings indicated that the LPS challenge decreased cell viability, increased cell apoptosis, and caused secretions of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Noticeably, LPS significantly upregulated XIST, MAPK14, and downregulated miR-132-3p. Mechanistically, XIST acted as a molecular sponge to suppress miR-132-3p, and MAPK14 was identified as a target of miR-132-3p. Functional analyses demonstrated that XIST silencing remarkably increased cell survival and alleviated cell death and lung injury through decreasing TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, accumulation of inflammatory cells, alveolar hemorrhage, MDA release, and increased PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, as well as upregulating Bcl-2, and downregulating Bax, MAPK14, and p-extracellular signal-regulated kinases ½. In contrast, inhibition of the miR-132-3p antagonized the effects of XIST silencing. In conclusion, inhibition of XIST exhibited a protective role in LPS-induced ALI through modulating the miR-132-3p/MAPK14 axis.","Li, Chen; Liu, Jian-Hua; Su, Jing; Lin, Wei-Jia; Zhao, Jian-Qing; Zhang, Zhi-Hua; Wu, Qi",Mol Cell Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8330477/,60
20320,Age-Associated Changes in Recombinant H5 Highly Pathogenic and Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza Hemagglutinin Tissue Binding in Domestic Poultry Species,2021-07-28,"Chronic pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience that persists or recurs more than three months and may extend beyond the expected time of healing. Recently, nociplastic pain has been introduced as a descriptor of the mechanism of pain, which is due to the disturbance of neural processing without actual or potential tissue damage, appearing to replace a concept of psychogenic pain. An interdisciplinary task force of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) compiled a systematic classification of clinical conditions associated with chronic pain, which was published in 2018 and will officially come into effect in 2022 in the 11th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11) by the World Health Organization. ICD-11 offers the option for recording the presence of psychological or social factors in chronic pain; however, cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions in the pathogenesis of chronic pain are missing. Earlier pain disorder was defined as a condition with chronic pain associated with psychological factors, but it was replaced with somatic symptom disorder with predominant pain in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) in 2013. Recently clinical nosology is trending toward highlighting neurological pathology of chronic pain, discounting psychological or social factors in the pathogenesis of pain. This review article discusses components of the pain pathway, the component-based mechanisms of pain, central and peripheral sensitization, roles of chronic inflammation, and the involvement of tryptophan-kynurenine pathway metabolites, exploring the participation of psychosocial and behavioral factors in central sensitization of diseases progressing into the development of chronic pain, comorbid diseases that commonly present a symptom of chronic pain, and psychiatric disorders that manifest chronic pain without obvious actual or potential tissue damage.","Tanaka, Masaru; Török, Nóra; Tóth, Fanni; Szabó, Ágnes; Vécsei, László",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8389666/,60

Collection of sufficient numbers of adult Simulium to detect infective O. volvulus larvae is hindered by limited sampling tools for these flies. Here, we tested for the first time the Host Decoy Trap (HDT), an exposure free method previously developed for Anopheles vectors of malaria parasites, as a potential sampling tool for adult Simulium. In three replicates of a randomized Latin square experimental design, the HDT was compared to Human Landing Catches (HLC) and the Esperanza Window Trap (EWT). A total of 8,531 adult S. damnosum sensu lato blackflies (S. squamosum group) were found in catches from the three different trapping methods. The HDT (mean catch 533 ± 111) caught significantly more S. squamosum than the EWT (mean catch 9.1 ± 2.2), a nearly 60-fold difference. There was no significant difference between the HLC (mean catch 385.6 ± 80.9) and the HDT. Larvae indistinguishable from those of O. volvulus were dissected from 2.86% of HDT samples (n = 70) and 0.35% of HLC samples (n = 285); a single infective third-stage larvae (L3) was found during dissection of a sample from the HDT. Owing to its very high capture rate, which was comparable to the HLC and significantly greater than EWT, alongside the presence of infected flies in its catch, the HDT represents a potentially valuable new tool for blackfly collection in elimination settings, where thousands of flies are needed for parasite screening.","Talom, Blaise Armand Defo; Enyong, Peter; Cheke, Robert A.; Djouaka, Rousseau; Hawkes, Frances M.",Acta Trop,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8326245/,60

Integrating primary care with social services could utilise resources more efficiently, and improve experiences for patients, their families, and carers. There is limited evidence on progress including key barriers to and drivers of integration to inform large-scale national change. AIM: To elicit stakeholder views on drivers and barriers of integrated primary care and social services, and highlight opportunities for successful implementation. DESIGN AND SETTING: A qualitative interview study. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews with maximum variation sampling to capture stakeholder views across services and professions. RESULTS: Thirty-seven interviews were conducted across England with people including GPs, nurses, social care staff, commissioners, local government officials, voluntary and private sector workers, patients, and carers. Drivers of integration included groups of like-minded individuals supported by good leadership, expanded interface roles to bridge gaps between systems, and co-location of services. Barriers included structural and interdisciplinary tension between professions, organisational self-interest, and challenges in record sharing. CONCLUSION: Drivers and barriers to integration identified in other contexts are also present in primary care and social services. Benefits of integration are unlikely to be realised if these are not addressed in the design and execution of new initiatives. Efforts should go beyond local- and professional-level change to include wider systems- and policy-level initiatives. This will support a more systems-wide approach to integrated care reform, which is necessary to meet the complex and growing needs of an ageing multimorbid population.","Dambha-Miller, Hajira; Simpson, Glenn; Hobson, Lucy; Olaniyan, Doyinsola; Hodgson, Sam; Roderick, Paul; Fraser, Simon DS; Little, Paul; Everitt, Hazel; Santer, Miriam",British Journal of General Practice,https://bjgp.org/content/bjgp/early/2021/05/14/BJGP.2020.1100.full.pdf,60

In this respect, it does not differ from the management of the natural emergence of an infectious disease (for example SARS). At all times it is necessary to establish precautions for the clinical management of severely ill persons. The possibility of professional clinical management depends on the number of affected people at one time and the necessary precautions for the medical personnel and the community. Kind, time, and region of the deliberate release of new or manipulated microorganisms or the natural emergence of an infectious disease are not predictable—the risk of human transmission is of course higher in regions with high population density. It is recommended that single cases of a highly contagious, lifethreatening disease be treated in central institutions with special technical support and facilities for staff protection (isolation unit). However, in terms of an epidemic situation, every single region must establish precautions for its own management of such cases.","Wirtz, A.; Gottschalk, R.; Weber, H.-J.",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080194/,60

The purified CVLP was immunogenic in rabbits. Sera containing antibodies against bovine enteric, canine, OC43, and 229E coronaviruses(CV) did not block binding of rabbit anti-CVLP to microtiter wells coated with purified CVLP. Immune EM using these antisera and nonaggregated CVLP also suggested that CVLP are antigenically distinct from other CV. False positives occurred when stools negative for CVLP by EM were tested. This nonspecific reaction was not blocked by sonicates of E.coli, Strep. fecalis, B.fragilis, or C.difficile, or by C.difficile antitoxin. Absorption of rabbit anti-CVLP serum with suckling mouse intestine did not improve specificity. More sophisticated purification of fecal CVLP is needed to improve ELISA sensitivity and specificity, and to characterize the antigen.","Lund, Mary E; Ray, C George; Payne, Claire; Minnich, Linda L",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086827/,60

Clinical signs and symptoms are nonspecific especially in infants and younger children and some even present with nonrespiratory complaints. Infectious agents causing pneumonia is not limited to viruses and bacteria, but it could also be due to Mycoplasma, Mycobacteria, fungi, protozoa, and parasites. Coinfection with two or more microbial agents can also occur. The etiologic agent of lower respiratory infection in a child is often difficult to obtain, but the patient’s age can help narrow the possible cause. Microbiological tests are important but could be difficult to obtain especially in younger children. Various medical imaging modalities not only play an important role as an aid in diagnosis but can also help during and after therapy. Imaging can also help evaluate complications to pneumonia and exclude other causes of respiratory distress including underlying developmental anomalies, foreign body, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and aspiration.

29006,Structure of SARS virus protease enzyme released to the public,2013-02-10,"Viruses have unique morphology and are therefore good candidates for negative staining. Negative staining with phosphotungstic acid (PTA) or uranyl acetate has facilitated the detection of many viruses in clinical specimens. Enhancement procedures have included the use of centrifugation and agar diffusion for concentrating virus particles, the use of solid phase capture reagents to trap virus particles and the use of secondary antibodies and electron dense markers to help visualize them. Techniques currently in use and employing negative staining include direct EM, immune electron microscopy (IEM), solid phase immune electron microscopy (SPIEM), colloidal gold-labeled protein A (PAG), solid phase IEM employing a second decorator antibody (SPIEMDAT), and solid phase IEM using colloided gold-labeled secondary antibodies (SPEIMDAGT). IEM methods assist with the detection of small viruses or viruses present in low numbers while PAG offers increased sensitivity over direct EM and IEM. In our experience the serum-in-agar (SIA) method is the most sensitive of the PAG IEM techniques for detection of rotavirus particles in clinical specimens. SPIEMDAT enhances the detection of small viruses which are often missed by other techniques due to background staining in specimens. SPEIMDAGT employing colloidal gold-labeled secondary antibody has increased sensitivity and offers the advantage of detecting viral antigen when whole virus particles are not visible. IEM techniques have recently been used for typing viruses using either monospecific antisera or monoclonal antibodies and colloidal gold-labeled secondary antibody.","Mahony, James B.; Chernesky, Max A.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148852/,60

Most viruses need to maintain high-level expression of their proteins for only a short time and need not be concerned with the viability of the host cell after infection. Attempts to modify a virus into a gene therapy vector can be hampered by this conflict. Virus-based methods of gene therapy are likely to be most useful in applications that require a burst of high-level expression in many of the patient's cells, such as in cancer therapy. Liposomal methods of gene therapy are flexible in that all the components of the system are controlled by designers. As these systems have become more sophisticated, they have begun to take on several characteristics of the viruses that they are intended to replace. The use of basic substances to condense DNA has increased the efficiency of encapsulation. The addition of nucleophilic proteins raises the efficiency of transfection. By adding antibodies or other targeting molecules to the surface of liposomes, preferential binding of vesicles to a desired cell type has been increased.","Hug, Peter; Sleight, Richard G.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148944/,60

The reaction occurred during initial challenge, resolved after discontinuation, and recurred during re-challenge. In patients who are appropriately being treated with ceftolozane/tazobactam for susceptible infections, consider a drug-induced reaction as a potential cause of rising leukocytosis; this should be differentiated from clinical failure if the patient is clinically stable.","Maniara, Bejoy P.; Wells, Ian",SN Compr Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7818065/,60
45650,Differences in Highly Pathogenic H5N6 Avian Influenza Viral Pathogenicity and Inflammatory Response in Chickens and Ducks,2021-01-29,"Victimology concerns victims of various traumas from accidents, disasters, assaults to wars. Survivors of trauma are also an area in clinical psychology since it is interested in the assessment and diagnosis of psychopathology and psychotherapy. Stress and mental health are intertwined; increased stress results in difficulties in feeling, thinking and behaving. The stress symptoms are an intrusion, avoidance, negative cognitions and mood, and arousal and reactivity. A trauma survivor might develop post-traumatic stress disorder. Healing trauma is so comprehensive that many professionals work from different aspects. From attorneys to mental health workers, many professionals deal with the aftereffects of trauma. Engaging with details of the trauma endangers not only the victims but also the professionals working with the victims. These professionals end up having psychological effects such as secondary trauma, vicarious trauma, compassion fatigue, countertransference and occupational burnout. Trauma has serious effects on its victims but not all effects are negative and paralyzing. Trauma victims might change their priorities in a way that they report more personal control over their life. This phenomenon is called posttraumatic growth. The paper aims to collaborate victimology with clinical psychology by highlighting psychopathology and psychological assessment.","Yılmaz, Tuğba",Curr Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7864618/,60

The study focusses on a Portuguese rural county, Penamacor, which, for several decades, has suffered a continuous exodus of population and the consequent aging of the remaining population but where, recently, there was a spontaneous phenomenon of foreign people arriving and settling in the area. Thus, through the case of Penamacor, this study aims to answer the following questions: Who are these migrants, and what are their motivations for mobility and to settle in the territory? Are they all the same? How do they make a living in Penamacor? In particular, it seeks to understand whether entrepreneurship (in tourism or other sectors) is a possibility of income generation for these immigrants. Furthermore, it intends to understand what the impact of these immigrants in the territory is, concerning the creation of wealth and well-being in the community. Do they act as community entrepreneurs? Does their presence in the territory generate other mobility flows, through the attraction of other (family and friends) tourists or immigrants?","Dinis, Anabela",The Impact of Tourist Activities on Low-Density Territories,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7968434/,60

51024,Dengue Virus Envelope Protein Domain III Induces Nlrp3 Inflammasome-Dependent NETosis-Mediated Inflammation in Mice,2021-03-17,"Most explanations for the crisis of the liberal order revolve around geopolitics, globalization, economic resentment fueling new forms of populism and nationalism, and Western states following their interests away from liberal values and institutions of their creation. But international orders are produced and legitimated by both material and spiritual forces. The spirit in liberalism is moral progress defined by practices of humanity. If the Liberal International Order (LIO) is in decline, then perhaps we should consider its moral foundations. Section “Introduction” briefly introduces the question of international order, categorizes international relations theories according to the mixture of consent and coercion, and how legitimacy often refers not only to the existing order but a vision of progress. This is particularly true of the liberal international order. Section “International Order, Legitimacy, and Progress” turns to the liberal international order, progress, and the possible spiritual decline of the liberal international order. After briefly considering the liberal in international liberalism and the late 20th-century emergence of the liberal international order, I argue that one reason for its declining moral foundations is because of the pronounced individualism that resides at the heart of the contemporary international order. In other words, the sources of decline are not exogenous but rather part of liberalism. The Conclusion asks: what is next? The conjunction of the decline of the LIO and COVID-19 has complicated the debate about the future international order, and much of the conversation hinges on whether and how the United States can recover from its self-destructive tendencies and China’s intentions.

To compensate for the suspension of in-person teaching, many universities mandated that teachers utilise video-conferencing software (VCS) to deliver synchronous online lessons conducted through VCS. This study explored the impact of ERT and the requirement to teach synchronously online through VCS on the motivation of university teachers at a major university in Hong Kong. In-depth interviews were conducted with nine teachers who had completed a full semester of ERT. The findings suggest that the teachers fell into two distinct groups. Teachers in one group (n = 5) seemed to thrive, reporting mainly positive effects of ERT on their motivation, while the others (n = 4) seemed to be just surviving, reported mainly negative effects. For members of the “thriving” group, the semester reinvigorated their teaching and provided them with new skills; members of the “surviving” group, by contrast, questioned their ability to teach, found it hard to build a rapport with learners, felt isolated, and struggled to find job satisfaction. The study concludes with a discussion of measures that could help university teachers to maintain their motivation during online instruction.","Moorhouse, Benjamin Luke; Kohnke, Lucas",Asia-Pacific Edu Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8047595/,60

According to international recommendations, we did not discontinue immunosuppressive or biologic drugs and reorganized biologic drug infusions’ administration to minimize the risk of infection. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the adherence to the scheduled biologic therapies in a single tertiary center including both IBD adult and pediatric patients treated with biological agents during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Demographic information, clinical data and the adherence to the therapy were collected in all consecutive IBD patients treated with biologic agents from March 2020 to February 2021. Moreover, we reported the clinical outcome of IBD patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A total of 278 subjects (171 male) treated with a biologic agent (34 children) were included. The mean age was 41.6 ± 17.3 years (range 5 – 88), and the mean disease duration was 12.7 ± 10.1 years (range 0.2 – 49). One hundred eleven patients (39.9 %) had ulcerative colitis, and 167 (60.0 %) had Crohn’s disease. About the therapy: 73 patients were receiving infliximab, 93 adalimumab, 20 golimumab, 59 vedolizumab, 29 ustekinumab, and 4 an experimental compound. 31 patient, including 1 child, (11.1 %) were treated with combination therapy. The mean Charlson Comorbidity Index was 1.5 (range 0 – 8). Twenty one patients (2 pediatrics and nineteen adults) (7.5 %) had a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 infection. Only one of them (an adult man) was hospitalized but did not require intensive care unit measures. Compared to cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population in our Region, the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort was significantly higher (7.5% vs 4.0%, p < 0.002). Twelve adult patients (4.3%) postponed biologic therapy for fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first wave of the pandemic, and two of them (16.6%) experienced a clinical relapse. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, the adherence to biologic therapy was high during the pandemic, but the rate of clinical relapse in patients who postponed the scheduled administration of therapy was relevant. Although the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly higher than in general population, the clinical impact was mild as no patients experienced a severe form of COVID-19.","Martino, G; Carparelli, S; Marseglia, A; Pastore, M R; Placentino, M; Nardella, M; Guerra, M; Palmieri, O; Latiano, A; Perri, F; Ercolino, F; Bossa, F",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194853/,60
56649,Quest for Novel Preventive and Therapeutic Options Against Multidrug-Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa,2021-08-09,"BACKGROUND: Caring for a preterm infant is known to be a stressful experience as these infants are at a high risk of medical sequelae and developmental delays. Early intervention is imperative for the best developmental outcome for the infant. Such interventions are often delivered through the mother or primary caregiver; however, healthcare professionals are seldom aware of all the factors that influence maternal well-being, potentially influencing her ability to provide optimal care. AIM: To explore the experiences of a group of vulnerable women, namely, isiXhosa-speaking mothers of preterm infants living in low socio-economic circumstances in the Western Cape province of South Africa, regarding having, caring for and feeding their preterm infants within the first 6 months of the infant’s life. SETTING: A follow-up clinic for preterm infants and their mothers at a public tertiary hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. METHODS: The study employed a qualitative, cross-sectional design that was explorative and contextual in nature. A discussion schedule was used to guide 15 in-depth interviews with mothers that were later thematically analysed. RESULTS: Social support and religion positively influenced maternal coping. The infant’s medical stability was the main concern for mothers and concerns regarding the infant’s development did not arise. Prematurity influenced mothers’ decisions to use traditional medicines and hospital care affected some traditional practices. CONCLUSION: The study findings highlighted the influence of traditional and religious beliefs, the importance of the cultural education of medical staff members and a support system to improve maternal experiences. CONTRIBUTION: The findings provide insights into maternal experiences with implications for healthcare practitioners’ continued education in an ethnically diverse setting.","Buys, Kristen; Gerber, Berna",Health SA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8335761/,60

60195,Label-free fluorometric detection of influenza viral RNA by strand displacement coupled with rolling circle amplification.,2021-01-07,"RATIONALE Eosinophils drive pathophysiology in stable and exacerbating eosinophilic asthma, and therefore treatment is focused on the reduction of eosinophil numbers. Mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that neutralizes IL-5 and efficiently attenuates eosinophils, proved clinically effective in severe eosinophilic asthma but not in mild asthma. OBJECTIVES To study the effect of mepolizumab on virus-induced immune responses in mild asthma. METHODS Patients with mild asthma, steroid-naive and randomized for eosinophil numbers, received 750 mg mepolizumab intravenously in a placebo-controlled double-blind trial, 2 weeks after which patients were challenged with rhinovirus (RV) 16. FEV1, FVC, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, symptom scores (asthma control score), viral load (PCR), eosinophil numbers, humoral (luminex, ELISA), and cellular (flow cytometry) immune parameters in blood, BAL fluid, and sputum, before and after mepolizumab and RV16, were assessed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Mepolizumab attenuated baseline blood eosinophils and their activation, attenuated trendwise sputum eosinophils, and enhanced circulating natural killer cells. Mepolizumab did not affect FEV1, FVC, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide, neither at baseline nor after RV16. On RV16 challenge mepolizumab did not prevent eosinophil activation but did enhance local B lymphocytes and macrophages and reduce neutrophils and their activation. Mepolizumab also enhanced secretory IgA and reduced tryptase in BAL fluid. Finally, mepolizumab affected particularly RV16-induced macrophage inflammatory protein-3a, vascular endothelial growth factor-A, and IL-1RA production in BAL fluid. CONCLUSIONS Mepolizumab failed to prevent activation of remaining eosinophils and changed RV16-induced immune responses in mild asthma. Although these latter effects likely are caused by attenuated eosinophil numbers, we cannot exclude a role for basophils.

However, there are few long-term data on intra-individual EOS count variability among patients with eosinophilic asthma. OBJECTIVE This post hoc analysis of two phase III clinical trials from the reslizumab BREATH program explored the variability of blood EOS counts in patients with eosinophilic asthma receiving placebo. METHODS Pooled data from study participants receiving placebo (previously randomized 1:1 to receive reslizumab or placebo) were analyzed for blood EOS count variability over 52 weeks. EOS counts were measured up to twice during screening, every 4 weeks from randomization to the end of treatment and at the 90-day follow-up visit. RESULTS Of 476 included patients, 31 (6.5%), 38 (8.0%), 55 (11.6%) and 352 (73.9%) patients had baseline blood EOS counts of <150 cells/μL, ≥150 to <300 cells/μL, ≥300 to <400 cells/μL and ≥400 cells/μL, respectively. Patients frequently shifted between EOS count categories during the 52-week treatment period, most often moving to the highest EOS category. Among patients in each of the lower three EOS categories, 27 to 56% of patients shifted to the ≥400 cells/μL category at some point during the treatment period. CONCLUSION Intra-individual variability in blood EOS count was high among eosinophilic asthma patients receiving placebo, with shifts to ≥400 cells/μL from lower categories frequently observed. Repeat determinations of blood EOS count may be important to ensure appropriate selection of therapy in patients with severe asthma.","Corren, Jonathan; Du, Evelyn; Gubbi, Ananda; Vanlandingham, Rebecca",The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

Emerging evidence indicates SIPOs have reduced COVID-19 cases. Using data starting at different dates in March through May 15, 2020, we examine effects of SIPOs on daily growth rates of COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations using event study models. We find that SIPOs reduced the daily mortality growth rate after nearly three weeks from enactment, and the daily growth rate of hospitalizations two weeks after enactment. After 42 days from enactment, the daily mortality growth rate declined by up to 6.1 percentage points. Projections suggest as many as 250,000-370,000 deaths possibly averted by May 15 in the 42 states plus the District of Columbia with statewide SIPOs. The daily hospitalization growth rate examined in 19 states with SIPOs and 3 states without SIPOs with data on hospitalizations has declined by up to 8.4 percentage points after 42 days. This evidence suggests that SIPOs have been effective in reducing the daily growth rates of COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations.

The DELTEX family ubiquitin ligases (DTX1 to DTX4 and DTX3L) are characterized by a RING domain followed by a C-terminal domain (DTC) of hitherto unknown function. Here, we use two label-free mass spectrometry techniques to investigate the interactome and ubiquitinated substrates of human DTX2 and identify a large proportion of proteins associated with the DNA damage repair pathway. We show that DTX2-catalyzed ubiquitination of these interacting proteins requires PARP1/2-mediated ADP-ribosylation and depends on the DTC domain. Using a combination of structural, biochemical, and cell-based techniques, we show that the DTX2 DTC domain harbors an ADP-ribose-binding pocket and recruits poly-ADP-ribose (PAR)-modified proteins for ubiquitination. This PAR-binding property of DTC domain is conserved across the DELTEX family E3s. These findings uncover a new ADP-ribose-binding domain that facilitates PAR-dependent ubiquitination.","Ahmed, Syed Feroj; Buetow, Lori; Gabrielsen, Mads; Lilla, Sergio; Chatrin, Chatrin; Sibbet, Gary J; Zanivan, Sara; Huang, Danny T",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abc0629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937373/,60
63647,Mammalian innate resistance to highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus infection is mediated through reduced proinflammation and infectious virus release.,2012,"Visualizations rely on highlighting to attract and guide our attention. To make an object of interest stand out independently from a number of distractors, the underlying visual cue, e.g., color, has to be preattentive. In our prior work, we introduced Deadeye as an instantly recognizable highlighting technique that works by rendering the target object for one eye only. In contrast to prior approaches, Deadeye excels by not modifying any visual properties of the target. However, in the case of 2D visualizations, the method requires an additional setup to allow dichoptic presentation, which is a considerable drawback. As a follow-up to requests from the community, this paper explores Deadeye as a highlighting technique for 3D visualizations, because such stereoscopic scenarios support dichoptic presentation out of the box. Deadeye suppresses binocular disparities for the target object, so we cannot assume the applicability of our technique as a given fact. With this motivation, the paper presents quantitative evaluations of Deadeye in VR, including configurations with multiple heterogeneous distractors as an important robustness challenge. After confirming the preserved preattentiveness (all average accuracies above 90 %) under such real-world conditions, we explore VR volume rendering as an example application scenario for Deadeye. We depict a possible workflow for integrating our technique, conduct an exploratory survey to demonstrate benefits and limitations, and finally provide related design implications.","Krekhov, Andrey; Cmentowski, Sebastian; Waschk, Andre; Kruger, Jens",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934370; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425106/,60
65363,Natural Products in Mitigation of SARS CoV Infections.,2020-10-27,"INTRODUCTION According to WHO, midwives are found competent to provide evidencebased and normalcy-facilitating maternity care. Models for midwifery care exist, but seem to be lacking explicit epistemological status, mainly focusing on the practical and organizational level of care delivery. To make the values and attitudes of care visible, it is important to implement care models with explicit epistemological status. The aim of this paper is to identify and gain an overview of publications of theoretical models for midwifery care. METHODS A mapping review was conducted with systematic searches in nine databases for studies describing a theoretical model or theory for midwifery care that either did or was intended to impact clinical practice. Eligibility criteria were refined during the selection process. RESULTS Six models from six papers originating from different parts of the world were included in the study. The included models were developed using different methodologies and had different philosophical underpinnings and complexity gradients. Some characteristics were common, the most distinctive being the emphasis of the midwife-woman relationship, secondly the focus on woman-centeredness, and thirdly the salutogenic focus in care. CONCLUSIONS Overall, scarcity exists regarding theoretical models for midwifery care with explicit epistemological status. Further research is needed in order to develop generic theoretical models with an epistemological status to serve as a knowledge base for midwifery healthcare.","Eri, Tine S; Berg, Marie; Dahl, Bente; Gottfreðsdóttir, Helga; Sommerseth, Eva; Prinds, Christina",European journal of midwifery,https://doi.org/10.18332/ejm/124110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33537631/,60

65857,Duck Interferon-Inducible Transmembrane Protein 3 Mediates Restriction of Influenza Viruses.,2016,"Future quantum repeater architectures, capable of efficiently distributing information encoded in quantum states of light over large distances, will benefit from multiplexed photonic quantum memories. In this work we demonstrate a temporally multiplexed quantum repeater node in a laser-cooled cloud of ^{87}Rb atoms. We employ the Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller protocol where pairs of photons and single collective spin excitations (so-called spin waves) are created in several temporal modes using a train of write pulses. To make the spin waves created in different temporal modes distinguishable and enable selective readout, we control the dephasing and rephasing of the spin waves by a magnetic field gradient, which induces a controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening of the involved atomic hyperfine levels. We demonstrate that by embedding the atomic ensemble inside a low finesse optical cavity, the additional noise generated in multimode operation is strongly suppressed. By employing feed forward readout, we demonstrate distinguishable retrieval of up to 10 temporal modes. For each mode, we prove nonclassical correlations between the first and second photon. Furthermore, an enhancement in rates of correlated photon pairs is observed as we increase the number of temporal modes stored in the memory. The reported capability is a key element of a quantum repeater architecture based on multiplexed quantum memories.","Heller, Lukas; Farrera, Pau; Heinze, Georg; de Riedmatten, Hugues",Physical review letters,https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.124.210504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530694/,60
66621,Human CD8⁺ and CD4⁺ T cell memory to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection.,2011,"OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to review the research literature for the emerging field of Integrative Medicine/Integrative Health Care (IM) using the methods of systematic review. METHODS We conducted an electronic literature search using PubMed, Allied and Complementary Medicine, BIOSIS Previews, EMBASE, the entire Cochrane Library, MANTIS, Social SciSearch, SciSearch Cited Ref Sci, PsychInfo, CINAHL, and NCCAM grantee publications listings from database inception to May 2009, as well as searches of the gray literature. Available studies published in English language were included. Three independent reviewers rated each article and assessed the methodological quality of studies using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. RESULTS Our initial search yielded 11 591 citations. Of these, only 660 were judged to be relevant to the purpose of our search. Most articles deal with implementing and implemented programs. They focus on practice models, strategies for integrative health, the business case, and descriptive studies. This is followed in terms of numbers by conceptual/philosophical writings. These in turn are followed by research articles including randomized controlled trials, program evaluations, and cost-effectiveness studies. The literature reflects an emerging field in that it is focused more on how to create IM than on researching outcomes. However, the lack of definition and clarity about the term integrative medicine (also known as integrative health care) and the absence of taxonomy for models of IM make it very difficult to efficiently conduct systematic reviews of this field at the moment. CONCLUSION Our review revealed that most articles focused on describing practice models and conceptual/philosophical models, whereas there are fewer randomized controlled trials and observation studies. The lack of consensus on a clear definition and taxonomy for integrative health care represents a major methodological barrier on conducting systematic literature reviews and meta-analysis in this emerging field.","Coulter, Ian D; Khorsan, Raheleh; Crawford, Cindy; Hsiao, An-Fu",Journal of manipulative and physiological therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmpt.2010.08.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21109060/,60

We study this phenomenon by exploring how nonphysician health care workers, who traditionally believed they were invisible and undervalued, perceive their newfound elevated status during the pandemic. Drawing from a qualitative study of 164 health care workers, we find that participants interpreted the sudden visibility and social valorization of their work as temporary and treated it with skepticism, incredulity, and as devoid of genuinely transformative power. We seek to contribute to the recent call to develop novel approaches to understanding the contours of the paradoxical nature of invisibility in the workplace by offering insights into what makes ""invisible"" workers accept or reject publicly driven elevation in their sudden social valorization.

However, since the introduction of total mesorectal excision (TME), local recurrence rates have been reduced significantly, and some patients can be spared from potentially toxic over treatment. The current study was designed to assess the factors that predict recurrence in an institutional series of patients with rectal cancer who had clinical T2 lymph node-positive (cT2N+) tumors or cT3N0/N+ tumors and underwent radical surgery without receiving preoperative chemoradiation. METHODS Between November 1997 and November 2008, the authors' multidisciplinary group preoperatively staged 398 patients with rectal cancer by using endorectal ultrasonography and/or magnetic resonance imaging. The analysis included 152 consecutive patients with cT2N+, cT3N0, or cT3N+ rectal cancer who underwent TME without receiving preoperative chemoradiation. Macroscopic assessment of the mesorectal excision and circumferential resection margins were determined. Factors potentially related to local recurrence (LR), disease-free survival (DFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were analyzed. RESULTS After a median follow-up of 39 months, the 5-year actuarial LR, DFS, and CSS rates were 9.5%, 65.4%, and 77.8%, respectively, for the whole group. Threatened mesorectal fascia at preoperative staging was the only independent preoperative factor that predicted a higher risk for LR (P = .007), shorter DFS (P = .007), and shorter CSS (P = .05). In particular, the 5-year LR rates for patients with and without preoperative threatened circumferential resection margins were 19.4% and 5.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The current results suggested that patients with rectal cancer clinically staged as T3N0/N+ or T2N+ with a free margin >2 mm from mesorectal fascia may undergo TME alone, avoiding over treatment with preoperative chemoradiation.","Frasson, Matteo; Garcia-Granero, Eduardo; Roda, Desamparados; Flor-Lorente, Blas; Roselló, Susana; Esclapez, Pedro; Faus, Carmen; Navarro, Samuel; Campos, Salvador; Cervantes, Andrés",Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.25866; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21264832/,60
74295,Protease-mediated entry via the endosome of human coronavirus 229E.,2009,"OBJECTIVE Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a common malignant tumor with a high mortality rate and poor prognosis. In this research, we investigated the exact role of long non-coding ribonucleic acids (lncRNA) MNX1-AS1 in the metastasis of ESCC and its possible mechanism. PATIENTS AND METHODS To investigate the functions of MNX1-AS1 in ESCC, quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was utilized to detect MNX1-AS1 expression of ESCC tissues and cells. Besides, functional assays, including transwell assay and wound healing assay, were performed. Furthermore, qRT-PCR and Western blot assay were used to explore the possible underlying regulatory mechanism. RESULTS The expression level of MNX1-AS1 was significantly increased in both ESCC tissues sample and cells. Moreover, knockdown of MNX1-AS1 markedly inhibited the migration and invasion of ESCC cells. Besides, knockdown of MNX1-AS1 remarkably down-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2). Furthermore, IGF2 expression was positively correlated with MNX1-AS1 expression in ESCC tissues. CONCLUSIONS MNX1-AS1 serves as a potential oncogene in ESCC, which can significantly promote ESCC cell migration and invasion by up-regulating IGF2. Our findings may provide a new therapeutic target of ESCC.","Zheng, D-N; Zhang, C-J; Sun, G-P",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_201907_18431; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31364117/,60
74746,Chikungunya virus envelope-specific human monoclonal antibodies with broad neutralization potency.,2011,"Rationale: Tamoxifen prevents the recurrence of breast cancer and is also beneficial against bone demineralization and arterial diseases. It acts as an Estrogen Receptor (ER) α antagonist in ER-positive breast cancers, whereas it mimics the protective action of 17β-estradiol (E2) in other tissues such as arteries. However, the mechanisms of these tissue-specific actions remain unclear.Objective: Here, we tested whether tamoxifen is able to accelerate endothelial healing and analyzed the underlying mechanisms. Methods and Results: Using three complementary mouse models of carotid artery injury, we demonstrated that both tamoxifen and estradiol accelerated endothelial healing, but only tamoxifen required the presence of the underlying medial smooth muscle cells. Chronic treatment with E2 and tamoxifen elicited differential gene expression profiles in the carotid artery. The use of transgenic mouse models targeting either whole ERα in a cell-specific manner or ERα sub-functions (membrane/extra-nuclear versus genomic/transcriptional) demonstrated that E2-induced acceleration of endothelial healing is mediated by membrane ERα in endothelial cells, while the effect of tamoxifen is mediated by the nuclear actions of ERα in smooth muscle cells. Conclusions: Whereas tamoxifen acts as an anti-estrogen and ERα antagonist in breast cancer, but also on the membrane ERα of endothelial cells, it accelerates endothelial healing through activation of nuclear ERα in smooth muscle cells, inviting to revisit the mechanisms of action of selective modulation of ERα.","Zahreddine, Rana; Davezac, Morgane; Smirnova, Natalia F; Buscato, Mélissa; Lhuillier, Emeline; Lupieri, Adrien; Solinhac, Romain; Vinel, Alexia; Vessieres, Emilie; Henrion, Daniel; Renault, Marie-Ange; Gadeau, Alain-Pierre; Flouriot, Gilles; Lenfant, Francoise; Laffargue, Muriel; Metivier, Raphael; Arnal, Jean-Francois; Fontaine, Coralie",Circulation research,https://doi.org/10.1161/circresaha.120.317062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33012251/,60

Among trauma-exposed mothers (Mage=32 years) and their young children (M=4 years), we tested whether genomic and proteomic biomarkers of pro-inflammatory imbalance prospectively predicted treatment response (PTSD and depression) to an empirically-supported behavioral treatment. Forty-three mother-child dyads without chronic disease completed Child Parent Psychotherapy (CPP) for roughly 9 months. Maternal blood was drawn pre-treatment, CD14+ monocytes isolated, gene expression derived from RNA sequencing (n=34; Illumina HiSeq 4000;TruSeqcDNA library), and serum assayed (n=43) for C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß). Symptoms of PTSD and depression decreased significantly from pre- to post-treatment for both mothers and children (all p's<.01). Nonetheless, a higher pre-treatment maternal pro-inflammatory imbalance of M1-like versus M2-like macrophage-associated RNA expression (M1/M2)(ß=.476, p=.004) and IL-1ß (ß=.333, p=.029), but not CRP, predicted lesser improvements in maternal PTSD symptoms, unadjusted and adjusting for maternal age, BMI, ethnicity, antidepressant use, income, education, and US birth. Only higher pre-treatment M1/M2 predicted a clinically-relevant threshold of PTSD non-response among mothers (OR=3.364, p=.015; ROC-AUC=.78). Additionally, higher M1/M2 predicted lesser decline in maternal depressive symptoms (ß=.556, p=.001), though not independent of PTSD symptoms. For child outcomes, higher maternal IL-1ß significantly predicted poorer PTSD and depression symptom trajectories (ß's=.318-.429, p's<.01), while M1/M2 and CRP were marginally associated with poorer PTSD symptom improvement (ß's=.295-.333, p's<.056). Pre-treatment pro-inflammatory imbalance prospectively predicts poorer transdiagnostic symptom response to an empirically-supported behavioral treatment for trauma-exposed women and their young children.","Aschbacher, Kirstin; Cole, Steve; Hagan, Melissa; Rivera, Luisa; Baccarella, Alyssa; Wolkowitz, Owen M; Lieberman, Alicia; Bush, Nicole R","Brain, behavior, and immunity",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2021.07.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34298096/,60

OBJECTIVES The current study aimed to study chewing features in adolescents as they naturally occur in home-based settings, and to test for a possible association with weight status. METHODS Forty-two adolescents (15.3 ± 1.3 years) were recruited (21 with healthy-weight/21 with overweight). Using a smartphone-assisted wearable electromyographic device, the chewing features of each participant were assessed over one evening, including the evening meal, in their natural home setting. RESULTS The mean (±SD) for chewing pace was 1.53 ± 0.22 Hz, chewing power 30.1% ± 4.8%, number of chewing episodes 63.1 ± 36.7 and chewing time 11.0 ± 7.7 minutes. The chewing pace of the group with overweight was slower than that of healthy weight (-0.20 Hz; 95% CI, -0.06 to -0.33; P = .005) while their chewing time was shorter (-4.9 minutes; 95% CI, 0.2-9.7; P = .044). A significant negative correlation was observed between BMI z-score and chewing pace (R = -.41; P = .007), and between BMI z-score and chewing time (R = -0.32; P = .039). CONCLUSION The current study suggests that adolescents who are overweight eat at a slower pace for a shorter period of time than their counterparts who are a healthy weight. This unexpected finding based on objective data appears to conflict with existing questionnaire findings but provides impetus for further work testing the effectiveness of changing eating behaviour as a weight-management intervention in youth.","Idris, Ghassan; Smith, Claire; Galland, Barbara; Taylor, Rachael; Robertson, Christopher J; Bennani, Hamza; Farella, Mauro",Pediatric obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijpo.12743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079494/,60

However, the detailed mechanism of this immune escape by CPSs is poorly understood. To pursue this question, polysaccharide dextran, ligand of SIGN-R1 as well as an appropriate model of the immunogenicity of many TI-2 polysaccharide antigens was used. SIGN-R1 bound to binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), a well-characterized endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone, primarily in non-ER compartments. Interestingly, SIGN-R1(+) macrophages in the MZ showed high expression of BiP, implying an important role of SIGN-R1 binding to BiP in vivo. To our surprise, dextran is rapidly transported into the ER and subsequently regurgitated out of cells in vitro or in vivo. BiP down-regulation in SIGN-R1 transfectant reduced the regurgitation of dextran, causing the accumulation of dextran in the ER. Therefore, these results demonstrated the first example to describe the intracellular trafficking and the regurgitation of TI-2 antigen dextran, suggesting the novel pathway of TI-2 antigen presentation to immune cells.","Choi, Hyeong-Jwa; Choi, Woo-Sung; Park, Jin-Yeon; Prabagar, Miglena G; Kang, Kyeong-Hyeon; Jeon, Se Jin; Park, Sang Gyu; Shin, Chan Young; Kang, Young-Sun",Immunobiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imbio.2010.09.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20951467/,60

The genetic-biasing hypothesis of language evolution postulates that genes and language features coevolve, such that a population that is genetically predisposed to perceiving a particular linguistic feature would tend to adopt that feature in their language. Statistical studies that correlated a large number of genetic variants and linguistic features not only generated this hypothesis but also specifically pinpointed a linkage between ASPM and lexical tone. However, there is currently no direct evidence for this association and, therefore, the hypothesis. In an experimental study, we provide evidence to link ASPM with lexical tone perception in a sample of over 400 speakers of a tone language. In addition to providing the first direct evidence for the genetic-biasing hypothesis, our results have implications for further studies of linguistic anthropology and language disorders.","Wong, Patrick C M; Kang, Xin; Wong, Kay H Y; So, Hon-Cheong; Choy, Kwong Wai; Geng, Xiujuan",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba5090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32537487/,60

The first case in Anhui, a province of China, was reported on January 10, 2020. In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. Different intervention measures have been implemented starting from different time nodes in the country and Anhui, the epidemic may be divided into three stages for January 10 to February 11, 2020, namely. We adopted interrupted time series method and develop an SEI/QR model to analyse the data. Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%. At the same time, the estimated basic reproduction number gradually decreased from the initial 2.9764 to 0.8667 and then to 0.5725. We conclude that the Wuhan lockdown and the centralized quarantine management policy in Anhui played a crucial role in the timely and effective mitigation of the epidemic in Anhui. One merit of this work is the adoption of morbidity data which may reflect the epidemic more accurately and promptly. Our estimated parameters are largely in line with the World Health Organization estimates and previous studies.","Tian, Jing Jing; Wu, Jia Bing; Bao, Yun Ting; Weng, Xiao Yu; Shi, Lei; Liu, Bin Bin; Yu, Xin Ya; Qi, Long Xing; Liu, Zhi Rong",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2020158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32987501/,60

The rehabilitation needs of people infected are receiving growing attention, as evidenced by the increasing number of publications, including those addressing the chronic consequences of infection. OBJECTIVES This rapid living systematic review reports the evidence published in November and December 2020 and summarises the entire body of literature on rehabilitation in COVID-19 patients published in 2020. METHODS This update was performed using the methodology reported by the second edition conducted by Cochrane Rehabilitation REH-COVER Action. We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and PEDro databases. Papers related to COVID-19 and rehabilitation were retrieved and summarised descriptively. RESULTS The search retrieved 4441 studies. After the removal of duplicates and the screening for title and abstract, we retained 105 studies. Of these, we included 54 in the qualitative synthesis of this update. According to OCEBM 2011 Levels of Evidence Table, most studies (64.8%) fall within the category of Level 4 evidence. Up to 40.7% of papers included COVID-19 patients in the post-acute phase. In 2020, our rapid living systematic review included 230 studies; most of these (73.9%) were Level 4 studies, 25.7% were Level 3, and only one study was Level 2. The evidence level improved over time. While most studies (44.8%) included patients with acute COVID-19, we observed a gradual increase in the number of reports about chronic symptoms and the long-term consequences of the infection. CONCLUSIONS The update of the rapid living systematic review by Cochrane Rehabilitation Field demonstrates an increase in the level of evidence of studies addressing the rehabilitation needs associated with COVID-19 infection. Although most studies are still case reports/series, there is a trend towards conducting prospective investigations of the early natural history of the disease (first months post- onset). High-quality-level studies on the efficacy of rehabilitation, and long-term monitoring of the disease and its sequelae are yet to emerge.","DE Sire, Alessandro; Andrenelli, Elisa; Negrini, Francesco; Patrini, Michele; Lazzarini, Stefano G; Ceravolo, Maria Gabriella",European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,https://doi.org/10.23736/s1973-9087.21.06870-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33599442/,60

Hierarchical regression analyses were performed. RESULTS Racial prejudice, maladaptive coping, and biased media use each explained stigmatization. Racial prejudice, comprising stereotypical beliefs and emotion toward Asian Americans, was a stronger predictor of stigmatization than maladaptive coping or biased media use. Fear concerning the ongoing COVID-19 situation and the use of social media and partisan cable TV also predicted stigmatization. Low self-efficacy in dealing with COVID-19, when associated with high estimated harm of COVID-19, increased stigmatization. High perceived institutional efficacy in the handling of COVID-19 increased stigmatization when linked to high estimated harm of COVID-19. On the other hand, high perceived collective efficacy in coping with COVID-19 was associated with low stigmatization. More indirect contacts with Asians via the media predicted less stigmatization. CONCLUSIONS Efforts to reduce stigmatization should address racial stereotypes and emotions, maladaptive coping, and biased media use by providing education and resources to the public. Fostering collective efficacy and media-based contacts with Asian Americans can facilitate these efforts.","Cho, Hyunyi; Li, Wenbo; Cannon, Julie; Lopez, Rachel; Song, Chi Chuck",Ethnicity & health,https://doi.org/10.1080/13557858.2020.1830035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33059486/,60
84330,The role of an active surveillance strategy of targeting household and neighborhood contacts related to leprosy cases released from treatment in a low-endemic area of China.,2020-08-14,"METHODS A systematic analysis was performed of the medical specialization academic programs of 20 different countries to establish which medical specialties take into account mental health issues in the specialty curricular design and which mental health content these programs address. The criteria that were explored in the educational programs include: 1) name of the medical specialties that take into account mental health content in curriculum design, 2) name of the mental health issues addressed by these programs. After independent review and data extraction, paired investigators compared the findings and reached consensus on all discrepancies before the final presentation of the data. Descriptive statistics evaluated the frequency of the data presented. RESULTS Internal medicine, family medicine, neurology, pediatrics and geriatrics were the specialties that included mental health topics in their programs. In four countries: Bangladesh, Serbia, the Netherlands and France, 50%of all graduate specialty training programs include mental health content. In ten countries: Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Belgium, India, Russia, Canada, Israel and Spain, between 20% and 49% of all graduate specialty training programs include mental health content. In six countries - Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Kenya, and the United States-less than 20% of all graduate specialty training programs include mental health content. DISCUSSION The proposal that we have made in this article should be taken into account by decision-makers, in order to complement the different postgraduate training programs with mental health issues that are frequently present with other physical symptoms. It is not our intention that the different specialists know how to treat psychiatric comorbidities, but rather pay attention to their existence and implications in the diagnosis, evolution and prognosis of many other diseases. The current fragmentation of medicine into ever finer specialties makes the management of comorbidity ever more difficult: a reorientation of post- graduate training might improve the situation.","Heinze, Gerhard; Sartorius, Norman; Guizar Sanchez, Diana Patricia; Bernard-Fuentes, Napoleón; Cawthorpe, David; Cimino, Larry; Cohen, Dan; Lecic-Tosevski, Dusica; Filipcic, Igor; Lloyd, Cathy; Mohan, Isaac; Ndetei, David; Poyurovsky, Michael; Rabbani, Golam; Starostina, Elena; Yifeng, Wei; EstefaníaLimon, Limón",International journal of psychiatry in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/00912174211007675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827304/,60

Here, we report atomic layer deposition of boron nitride (ALD-BN) using BCl3 and NH3 precursors directly on thermal SiO2 substrates at a relatively low temperature of 600 °C. The films were characterized by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy wherein the uniform, atomically smooth, and nanocrystalline layered-BN thin film growth is observed. The growth rate is ~0.042 nm/cycle at 600 °C, a temperature significantly lower than that of h-BN grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The dielectric properties of the ALD-BN measured from Metal Oxide Semiconductor Capacitors (MOSCAPs) are comparable with that of SiO2. Moreover, the ALD-BN exhibits a two-fold increase in carrier mobility of graphene field effect transistors (G-FETs/ALD-BN/SiO2) due to the less surface charge density and inert surface of ALD-BN in comparison to that of G-FETs fabricated on bare SiO2. Therefore, this work suggests that the transfer-free deposition of ALD-BN on SiO2 may be a promising candidate as a substrate for high performance graphene devices.","Lee, Jaebeom; Ravichandran, Arul Vigneswar; Mohan, Jaidah; Cheng, Lanxia; Lucero, Antonio T; Zhu, Hui; Che, Zifan; Catalano, Massimo; Kim, Moon J; Wallace, Robert M; Venugopal, Archana; Choi, Woong; Colombo, Luigi; Kim, Jiyoung",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c07548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32667778/,60

88214,Preferential cytolysis of peripheral memory CD4+ T cells by in vitro X4-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection before the completion of reverse transcription.,2008,"BACKGROUND Musculoskeletal specialists who attempt to discuss the connection between mental health (thoughts and emotions) and physical health (symptom intensity and activity tolerance) with patients, may fear that they risk offending those patients. In a search for language that creates comfort with difficult conversations, some specialists favor a biomedical framework, such as central sensitization, which posits abnormal central neuron activity. Without addressing the relative accuracy of mind- or brain-based conceptualizations, we addressed crafted and practiced communication strategies as conversation starters that allow specialists to operate within a biopsychosocial framework without harming the relationship with the patient. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We measured (1) patient resonance with various explanations of the mind-body connection, including examples of both mind- and brain-based communication strategies, and (2) factors associated with resonance and emotional reactions to the explanations. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, all adult new and returning patients who were literate in English and who attended several musculoskeletal specialty offices were invited to complete questionnaires addressing reactions to one of seven explanations of the mind-body connection assigned using a random number generator. Acknowledging that the relative accuracy of mind-based and nerve- or brain-based strategies are speculative, we developed the following conversation starters: two explanations that were cognitively framed (""the mind is a great story teller""; one positively framed and one negatively framed), two emotionally framed explanations (""stressed or down""; one positively framed and one negatively framed), one mentioning thoughts and emotions in more neutral terms (""mind and body work together … thoughts and emotions affect the way your body experiences pain""), and two biomedical neurophysiology-based explanations (""nerves get stuck in an over-excited state"" and ""overstimulated nerves""), all crafted with the assistance of a communication scholar. It was unusual for people to decline (although the exact number of those who did was not tracked) and 304 of 308 patients who started the questionnaires completed them and were analyzed. In this sample, 51% (155 of 304) were men, and the mean ± SD age was 49 ± 17 years. Reactions were measured as resonance (a 1 to 5 Likert scale regarding the degree to which the stated concept aligns with their understanding of health and by inference is a comfortable topic of discussion) and self-assessment manikins using circled figurines to measure feelings of happiness (frowning to smiling figures), stimulation/excitement (a relaxed sleepy figure to an energized wide-eyed figure), and security/control (small to large figures). These are commonly used to quantify the appeal and emotive content of a given message. Patients also completed surveys of demographics and mental health. Multilevel multivariable linear regression models were constructed to assess factors associated with resonance, happiness, excitement, and control. RESULTS Controlling for potential confounding variables such as demographics and mental health measures, a relatively neutral biopsychosocial explanation (""mind and body work together"") had the greatest mean resonance (4.2 ± 0.8 versus 3.8 ± 0.9 for the other explanations; p < 0.01) and the largest regression coefficient for resonance (0.78 [95% confidence interval 0.41 to 1.15]). The next-most-resonant explanations were biomedical (""excitable nerves"", ""over-excited state""). Biopsychosocial explanations that mention stress, distress, or cognitive bias (""mind is a great storyteller"") had lower resonance. People with greater unhealthy cognitive bias regarding pain (more catastrophic thinking) were less comfortable with all the explanations (lower resonance, regression coefficient -0.03 [95% CI -0.06 to -0.01]). Emotional reactions were relatively comparable with the exception that people felt less control and security with specific explanations such as ""excitable nerves"" and ""mind is a great storyteller."" CONCLUSION Crafted communication strategies allow musculoskeletal specialists to address health within the biopsychosocial paradigm without harming their relationship with the patient. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Musculoskeletal specialists may be the first clinicians to notice mental health opportunities. It may be helpful for them to develop and practice effective communication strategies that make mental health a comfortable topic of discussion.","Gonzalez, Amanda I; Kortlever, Joost T P; Brown, Laura E; Ring, David; Queralt, Mark",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,https://doi.org/10.1097/corr.0000000000001635; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411452/,60
88464,Modulation of Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling by Human Herpesvirus 8 Interferon Regulatory Factor 1.,2016,"UNLABELLED BACKGROUND Although the mechanism of fentanyl-induced cough is unclear, several lines of evidence suggest that allergic mediators, such as histamine, may play a role in the production of fentanyl-induced coughs. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of fentanyl on cough sensitivity to inhaled citric acid and on histamine release in BALF in mice. METHODS The cough reflex was induced by the inhalation of citric acid. Male ICR mice were exposed to a nebulized solution of citric acid at a concentration of 0.1 M under conscious and identical conditions using a body plethysmograph. The number of coughs produced per 3-min period of exposure to citric acid was counted. Histamine content in BALF was analyzed by HPLC post-column derivatization and fluorescence detection. RESULTS Intravenous administration of fentanyl increased the number of citric acid-induced coughs. The fentanyl-induced enhancement of the number of citric acid-induced coughs was abolished in mice that had been pretreated with moguisteine, a rapidly adapting receptor (RAR) antagonist or fexofenadine, a histamine H1 receptor antagonist. Fentanyl significantly increased the concentration of histamine in BALF. CONCLUSION The results of this study suggest that fentanyl enhances the excitability of RARs to cause cough, and enhancement of histamine release in the airways may some how be related to this change.","Kamei, Junzo; Nakanishi, Yuki; Asato, Megumi; Ikeda, Hiroko",Cough,https://doi.org/10.1186/1745-9974-9-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23369146/,60

Medical students are antibiotic consumers and prescribers in the future. This study aimed to assess antibiotic knowledge and utilization among medical students in the Republic of Mali, and to determine the relationship between knowledge and health-seeking behavior in relation to antibiotic use. METHODS : A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the only public medical university in Mali. The questionnaire explored knowledge about antibiotics of medical students, and health behaviors for self-limiting illness. Data were analyzed in SPSS. RESULTS : A total of 446 medical students completed the questionnaire. The average knowledge score was 4.12 out of 10. Students with clinical experience performed higher (4.79 vs 3.74, p<0.01); 391(87.7%) medical students reported experience of self-limiting diseases in the past year. Of these 197(50.4%) went to see a doctor, 160 (81.2%) of whom were prescribed antibiotics: 151 medical students self-treated, with 121(80.1%) using antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS : This study shows poor knowledge and massive misuse of antibiotics among medical students in Mali. Promoting education on the mechanism of antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance and rational antibiotic use among medical students should be a priority in the medical school curriculum.","Chen, Jie; Sidibi, Aissata Mahamadou; Shen, Xiaohui; Dao, Kalo; Maiga, Alain; Xie, Ying; Hesketh, Therese",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2021.1857731; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33251896/,60

Anti-Xa activity can be measured as a surrogate of LMWH efficacy. We present 52 patients treated with tinzaparin anticoagulation on HD, confirming that fixed dosing is safe and efficacious with sound pharmacodynamic reason in relation to anti-Xa profiling. METHODS We undertook a prospective audit in a single dialysis unit. All patients were established on a simple anticoagulation protocol for at least 1 month prior to the audit. Blood anti-Xa activity was measured at time 0, 30, 60 and 120 min into and at the end of HD. Efficacy and safety data were collected on the study day and the two sessions before and after it. RESULTS Fifty-two patients were included in the efficacy and safety analysis with 43 patients undergoing anti-Xa analysis (9 sampling errors). Using current consensus (an end-HD anti-Xa activity of <0.4 IU/ml), our fixed-dose protocol resulted in satisfactory safety in all patients tested. Of 260 HD sessions, 10 (4%) had reduced tinzaparin efficacy. During 105 dialysis sessions (21 patients) using an arteriovenous fistula, 4 patients had one episode of minor bleeding and there were 6 episodes (2 patients) of post-needle-compression time greater than 15 min. CONCLUSION Tinzaparin administered thrice weekly as a fixed dose has good efficacy and is well tolerated as an anticoagulant during HD when used according to our protocol.","Kirwan, Christopher J; Baig, Zahid F; Platton, Sean; MacCullum, Peter K; Ashman, Neil",Nephron.

93505,Potent In Vivo NK Cell-Mediated Elimination of HIV-1-Infected Cells Mobilized by a gp120-Bispecific and Hexavalent Broadly Neutralizing Fusion Protein.,2017,"PURPOSE Anticancer dendritic cell (DC) vaccines require the DCs to relocate to lymph nodes (LN) to trigger immune responses. However, these migration rates are typically very poor. Improving the targeting of ex vivo generated DCs to LNs might increase vaccine efficacy and reduce costs. We investigated DC migration in vivo in humans under different conditions. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN HLA-A*02:01 patients with melanoma were vaccinated with mature DCs loaded with tyrosinase and gp100 peptides together with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (NCT00243594). For this study, patients received an additional intradermal vaccination with (111)In-labeled mature DCs. The injection site was pretreated with nonloaded, activated DCs, TNFα, or Imiquimod; granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor was coinjected or smaller numbers of DCs were injected. Migration was measured by scintigraphy and compared with an intrapatient control vaccination. In an ex vivo tissue model, we measured CCL21-directed migration of (19)F-labeled DCs over a period of up to 12 hours using (19)F MRI to supplement our patient data. RESULTS Pretreatment of the injection site induced local inflammatory reactions but did not improve migration rates. Both in vitro and in vivo, reduction of cell numbers to 5 × 10(6) or less cells per injection improved migration. Furthermore, scintigraphy is insufficient to study migration of such small numbers of (111)In-labeled DCs in vivo. CONCLUSION Reduction of cell density, not pretreatment of the injection site, is crucial for improved migration of DCs to LNs in vivo.","Aarntzen, Erik H J G; Srinivas, Mangala; Bonetto, Fernando; Cruz, Luis J; Verdijk, Pauline; Schreibelt, Gerty; van de Rakt, Mandy; Lesterhuis, W Joost; van Riel, Maichel; Punt, Cornelius J A; Adema, Gosse J; Heerschap, Arend; Figdor, Carl G; Oyen, Wim J; de Vries, I Jolanda M",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-12-1879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23382117/,60

DESIGN Scoping review. DATA SOURCES Medline up to August 2017. STUDY SELECTION All English studies on humans, in which overdiagnosis was discussed as a dominant theme. DATA EXTRACTION Studies were assessed on clinical field, study aim (ie, methodological or non-methodological), article type (eg, primary study, review), the type and role of diagnostic test(s) studied and the context in which these studies discussed overdiagnosis. RESULTS From 4896 studies, 1851 were included for analysis. Half of all studies on overdiagnosis were performed in the field of oncology (50%). Other prevalent clinical fields included mental disorders, infectious diseases and cardiovascular diseases accounting for 9%, 8% and 6% of studies, respectively. Overdiagnosis was addressed from a methodological perspective in 20% of studies. Primary studies were the most common article type (58%). The type of diagnostic tests most commonly studied were imaging tests (32%), although these were predominantly seen in oncology and cardiovascular disease (84%). Diagnostic tests were studied in a screening setting in 43% of all studies, but as high as 75% of all oncological studies. The context in which studies addressed overdiagnosis related most frequently to its estimation, accounting for 53%. Methodology on overdiagnosis estimation and definition provided a source for extensive discussion. Other contexts of discussion included definition of disease, overdiagnosis communication, trends in increasing disease prevalence, drivers and consequences of overdiagnosis, incidental findings and genomics. CONCLUSIONS Overdiagnosis is discussed across virtually all clinical fields and in different contexts. The variability in characteristics between studies and lack of consensus on overdiagnosis definition indicate the need for a uniform typology to improve coherence and comparability of studies on overdiagnosis.","Jenniskens, Kevin; de Groot, Joris A H; Reitsma, Johannes B; Moons, Karel G M; Hooft, Lotty; Naaktgeboren, Christiana A",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29284720/,60

A total of 209 students were assigned to 50 groups (18 medical student groups, 13 nursing student groups, and 19 mixed medical/nursing student groups). Learners performed group work during the orientation for the course, which was hosted using an online video conferencing system. The learners first performed the activity individually (10 min) and then engaged in a group discussion to reach consensus on their answers (30 min). We calculated the scores before and after the group discussion and shared the results with the students. Scores were improved after the group discussion (mean ± SEM, 23.7 ± 0.9) compared with before (37.3 ± 1.3) (P < .0001). Lower scores after the group discussion, which indicated the effect of the group discussion on making better decisions, were observed most in the mixed medical/nursing student groups, followed by the nursing student and medical student groups. We noted only 3 groups in which the group discussion showed a negative effect on decision-making: all 3 of these groups were mixed (3 of 19 groups; 16%). These data demonstrated the power of group discussion for solving tasks when the participants' professional fields were mixed. However, the small size of the interdisciplinary groups might have resulted in less effective discussion, which might be due in part to psychological barriers arising from professional differences. Online group work is effective for facilitating discussion and building consensus about decisions in interprofessional education for medical and nursing students. Potential psychological barriers may exist in about 16% of mixed group students at the start, which should be kept in mind by instructors.

One of the major benefits which favours this examination, is that this is a non-invasive, low-cost and radiation-free imaging modality which allows repeated imaging. LUS plays an important role in a wide range of pathologies, including cardiogenic oedema, acute respiratory distress syndrome and fibrosis. Specific LUS findings have proved useful and predictive of acute respiratory distress syndrome which is of particular relevance in the suspicion and monitoring of patients with lung disease. Furthermore, several studies have confirmed the role of LUS in the screening of interstitial lung diseases in connective tissue diseases. Given these data, LUS will likely play an important role in the management of COVID-19 patients from identification of specific abnormalities corresponding to definite pneumonia phases and CT scans findings. In addition, LUS could allow reduction in the exposure of health-care workers to potential infection. Herein, we provide a summary on emerging role of lung ultrasound in COVID-19 pneumonia.","Lepri, Gemma; Orlandi, Martina; Lazzeri, Chiara; Bruni, Cosimo; Hughes, Michael; Bonizzoli, Manuela; Wang, Yukai; Peris, Adriano; Matucci-Cerinic, Marco",European journal of rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.5152/eurjrheum.2020.2063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32392461/,60

These longitudinal data were analyzed with a novel method, using a mathematical model to describe the observed responses, and their variation among subjects. This allowed us to estimate biologically meaningful characteristics of the serum antibody response, like peak level and decay rate, and to compare these among natural infections and vaccine responses. Compared to natural infection, responses to PT after vaccination with the tested vaccines are smaller in magnitude and tend to decay slightly faster. When present in vaccines, FHA and Prn tend to produce high peak levels, higher than those in naturally infected patients, but these decay faster. As expected, the Dutch whole cell vaccine produced lower antibody responses than the acellular vaccines. This model allows a better comparison of the kinetics of vaccine induced antibody responses and after natural infection over a long follow up period.","Berbers, G A M; van de Wetering, M S E; van Gageldonk, P G M; Schellekens, J F P; Versteegh, F G A; Teunis, P F M",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.05.073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23742995/,60

101232,Evaluation of automated nucleic acid extraction methods for virus detection in a multicenter comparative trial.,2009,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by COVID-19 is now a global catastrophic event. Currently there is no approved drug or vaccine for the disease. Methylene blue (MB, oxidized form, blue color) has been used in many different areas of clinical medicine, ranging from malaria to orthopedics. Leucomethylene Blue (reduced form of MB, colorless) may be applied for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the scientific evidences. In severe patients, there is a cytokine storm (hyperinflammation) and high oxidative stress (OS). Inflammation and OS has a mutual correlation and exacerbate each other. In human body, MB first induces OS through absorbing electron (like a free radical) from other molecules, if the body could counteract to this OS, then reduced MB decreases OS through other mechanisms. Reduced MB could prevent inflammation, propagation of the virus RNA, and also improves hypoxia through reducing methemoglobin. Therefore, to avoid the increment of OS, we suggest using Leucomethylene Blue through the following protocol: The IV cocktail contains 50 mg MB (1mg/kg, 50-kg weight), 1000-2000 mg vitamin C, 500-1000 mg N-Acetylcysteine (or glutathione or cysteine or α-lipoic acid) and 10-20 gr urea (optional) in 100 ml dextrose 5%. Before the injection, the cocktail should be kept in a dark place for 1-2 hour to become fade or colorless.","Hamidi Alamdari, Daryoush; Bagheri Moghaddam, Ahmad; Amini, Shahram; Hamidi Alamdari, Aida; Damsaz, Mohammadamin; Yarahmadi, Amir",The archives of bone and joint surgery,https://doi.org/10.22038/abjs.2020.47745.2349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32607398/,60

The aim of this study was to assess feasibility and acceptability of a newly-developed, manualised single-session CCC intervention delivered face-to-face with service users in acute and crisis psychology services in South London. The study adopted a within-subjects pre-post-test design. Participants (N=23) were recruited from five acute psychiatric wards and a crisis resolution home treatment team. Service users had a range of diagnoses of complex and severe mental health conditions, in particular mood, personality, and psychotic disorders. Feasibility data was gathered for number of times the CCC formulation was accepted, duration of CCC intervention, clinician adherence to manualised protocol, and frequency of goal-based activity completion. Acceptability data on pre- and post-CCC mood and post-CCC helpfulness were self-reported by participants. Findings indicated a significant increase in positive mood (large effect) and moderate-high helpfulness rating post-intervention. Most participants reported goal-based activity completion. There was high fidelity to the protocol, high percentage of acceptance of the formulation and formulation components completed, and frequent single-session completion. Single-session CCC appears feasible and acceptable in acute and crisis psychology services and yields formulation-driven goal-based activities intended to stabilise mental health crisis. High fidelity to formulation protocol suggests broader applications for single-session CCC, e.g. to support clinical staff to manage crisis situations in their work environment or to train non-psychologist clinicians to deliver the intervention for service users. A randomised-controlled trial of single-session CCC would increase validity and generalisability of findings.","Bullock, Jonathan; Whiteley, Christopher; Moakes, Kaylee; Clarke, Isabel; Riches, Simon",Clinical psychology & psychotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32833291/,60

Due to its rapid outbreak, units for the evaluation of febrile patients in the pre-hospital setting were created. OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to develop a sensitive and simple tool to assess the risk of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients and thus select which patients would require a chest imaging study. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study in a cohort of individuals with suspected COVID-19 evaluated in a public academic healthcare center in Buenos Aires city. All adult patients with positive RT-PCR assay for SARS-COV2 between April 24 and May 19 of 2020 were included in the study. Pneumonia was defined as the presence of compatible signs and symptoms with imaging confirmation. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed. A risk indicator score was developed. RESULTS One hundred and forty-eight patients were included, 71 (48%) received the diagnosis of pneumonia. The final clinical model included four variables: age >- 40 years, cough, absence of sore throat, and respiratory rate >- 22. To create the score, we assigned values to the variables according to their ORs: 2 points for respiratory rate >- 22 and 1 point to the other variables. The AUC of the ROC curve was 0.80 (CI 95% 0.73-0.86). A cutoff value of 2 showed a sensitivity of 95.7% and a specificity of 43.24%.

We assessed the associations between LCA and clinical characteristics, inflammatory serum markers, in-hospital mortality. METHODS Ten thousand eight hundred fifty-six adult patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in 13 hospitals in New York (1 March to 27 April 2020) were analyzed retrospectively. Abnormalities of liver chemistries [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin] were defined as absent, mild-moderate (at least one value up to four times elevated), or severe. RESULTS LCA were mild-moderate in 63.9% and severe in 7.6% at admission. Risk factors for severe LCA were male sex and chronic liver disease. Conversely, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were less likely associated with severe LCA. AST elevation correlated weakly to modestly with inflammatory markers. On adjusted analysis, in-hospital mortality was 1.56 times and 1.87 times increased in patients with mild-to-moderate and severe LCA, respectively. Diabetes, hypertension, male sex, and age greater than 60 years was associated with incremental risk of mortality with increase severity of LCA, especially in the first week of hospitalization. HTN was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality unless LCA was present. CONCLUSION Increasing severity of LCA on hospital admission predicts early in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. Mortality associated with the known risk factors, hypertension, diabetes, male sex, and old age was accentuated in the presence of LCA. AST correlated modestly with inflammatory markers.","Satapathy, Sanjaya K; Kuntzen, Christian; Qiu, He; Jiang, Yu; Bodenheimer, Henry C; Roth, Nitzan C; Lee, Tai-Ping; Hirsch, Jamie S; Trindade, Arvind J; Bernstein, David E",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/meg.0000000000002055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33560687/,60

Flow diversion represents a feasible treatment, but no consensus exists as to which stent deployment technique is more suitable. METHODS All patients with ACoA aneurysms treated with flow diverters between April 2014 and November 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Aneurysm characteristics, follow-up results, and clinical outcome data were recorded, and a new classification comparing the diameters of both A1 segments is proposed: H1=same diameters; H2=<50% difference in diameters; H3= ≥50% difference; and Y=no A1 segment. RESULTS We analyzed 30 procedures in 30 patients with ACoA aneurysms, including 16 ruptured aneurysms treated with coiling embolization and 4 previously unruptured aneurysms (two Medina and two Woven EndoBridge devices). Adequate aneurysm occlusion occurred in 86.9%; one patient (3.3%) experienced symptomatic ischemic stroke. The global thromboembolic complications for each group were 17.6% (H1), 25% (H2), and 60% (H3). CONCLUSION Flow diversion treatment in this region is safe, feasible, and effective. The most suitable anatomical configuration for flow diverter treatment seems to be the H1 configuration where the 'I technique' is suitable (from an A1 segment to the ipsilateral A2). There is a tendency that the H3 configuration is not a good indication for flow diverter treatment. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the feasibility of this anatomical classification and the reproducibility of our findings.","Pagiola, Igor; Mihalea, Cristian; Caroff, Jildaz; Ikka, Léon; Chalumeau, Vanessa; Yasuda, Thomas; Marenco de la Torre, Joaquin; Iacobucci, Marta; Ozanne, Augustin; Gallas, Sophie; Marques, Marcio Chaves; Carrete, Henrique; Frudit, Michel Eli; Moret, Jacques; Spelle, Laurent",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2019-014858; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975737/,60

Ocular effects may occur because of the ACE-2 receptor in the retina. BACKGROUND To investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the retinal layers and optic disc parameters in previously confirmed COVID-19 patients using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). METHODS This study included 60 eyes of 60 subjects; 35 of them were in the COVID-19 group and the remaining 25 were in the control group. Patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 that had a negative result after treatment were included in the study. Macular and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements, each retinal layer thickness of all participants were done 14-30 days after COVID-19 symptom onset, following the negative result of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test using SD-OCT. RESULTS The mean value of central macular thickness was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than the control group (p = 0.02). The mean values of the ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer thickness in the COVID-19 group were signiﬁcantly thinner than control group (p = 0.04 and p = 0.04, respectively). Even though mean RNFL thickness measurements in all sections in the COVID-19 group was thinner than controls, there were no significant differences between groups (p > 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION In the early recovery phase, changes in the macula, ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer could be seen. These patients should be followed up closely for the recognition of new pathologies that could be seen in the late recovery phase.","Oren, Burak; Aksoy Aydemır, Gozde; Aydemır, Emre; Atesoglu, Halil Ibrahim; Goker, Yasin Sakir; Kızıltoprak, Hasan; Ozcelık, Kazım Caglar",Clinical & experimental optometry,https://doi.org/10.1080/08164622.2021.1916389; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34016010/,60
110035,Optimization of conditions for secretion of dengue virus type 2 envelope domain III using Pichia pastoris.,2010,"Tracheal transplantation without immunosuppressive therapy has been accomplished with a tissue-engineering approach using decellularized biological scaffolds in combination with recipient progenitor cells. The mechanisms of immune response directed towards these tracheal allografts have not been fully determined. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity of these grafts at the protein level, and functionally, in vitro and in vivo in a large animal model. Long-segment circumferential tracheal allografts were decellularized using two different protocols and recellularized using recipient mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and tracheal epithelial progenitor cells (TEC). Residual MHCI and MHCII immunostaining was found surrounding the submucosal glands despite cyclical decellularization. In an in vitro lymphocyte proliferation assay, CD4+ T cells continued to proliferate on decellularized pieces and this proliferation was inhibited by co-culture with autologous MSC. Allografts were heterotopically transplanted under a muscle flap in the neck of the recipients and decellularization was found to delay leukocyte infiltration but resulted in eventual cartilage degradation. Recellularization prevented this infiltration up to 3 weeks post-transplantation and allowed for preservation of the cartilage. The immune cells found within these grafts included a significant number of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Furthermore, gene expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-β1, involved in proliferation, differentiation and function of regulatory T cells was found in these grafts. These results indicate that the immunological modification induced by recellularized tracheal scaffolds is an active process involving the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, rather than simply the removal of donor-derived antigenic components.","Haykal, Siba; Zhou, Yingzhe; Marcus, Paula; Salna, Michael; Machuca, Tiago; Hofer, Stefan O P; Waddell, Thomas K",Biomaterials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.04.044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23663928/,60
112319,SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates in rapid development.,2020-10-29,"Unravelling when divergent lineages constitute distinct species can be challenging, particularly in complex scenarios combining cryptic diversity and phylogenetic discordances between different types of molecular markers. Combining a phylogenetic approach with the study of contact zones can help to overcome such difficulties. The Podarcis hispanicus species complex has proven to be prosperous in independent evolutionary units, sometimes associated with cryptic diversity. Previous studies have revealed that one of the species of this complex, P. guadarramae, comprises two deeply divergent yet morphologically indistinguishable evolutionary units, currently regarded as subspecies (P. g. guadarramae and P. g. lusitanicus). In this study we used molecular data to address the systematics of the two lineages of Podarcis guadarramae and the closely related P. bocagei. Firstly, we reconstructed the species tree of these three and two additional taxa based on 30 nuclear loci using the multispecies coalescent with and without gene flow. Secondly, we used SNPs obtained from RADseq data to analyze the population structure across the distribution limits P. g. lusitanicus and P. g. guadarramae, and for comparison, a contact zone between P. bocagei and P. g. lusitanicus. Nuclear phylogenetic relationships between these three taxa are clearly difficult to determine due to the influence of gene flow, but our results give little support to the monophyly of P. guadarramae, potentially due to a nearly simultaneous divergence between them. Genetic structure and geographic cline analysis revealed that the two lineages of P. guadarramae replace each other abruptly across the sampled region and that gene flow is geographically restricted, implying the existence of strong reproductive isolation. Podarcis bocagei and P. g. lusitanicus show a similar degree of genetic differentiation and reproductive isolation, with very low levels of admixture in syntopy. These results support that all three forms are equally differentiated and reproductively isolated. In consequence, we conclude that the two former subspecies of Podarcis guadarramae constitute valid, yet cryptic species, that should be referred to as P. lusitanicus and P. guadarramae.","Caeiro-Dias, Guilherme; Rocha, Sara; Couto, Alvarina; Pereira, Carolina; Brelsford, Alan; Crochet, Pierre-André; Pinho, Catarina",Molecular phylogenetics and evolution,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2021.107270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352374/,60

113478,SARS-CoV-2 Entry inhibitors targeting virus-ACE2 or virus-TMPRSS2 interactions.,2021-04-19,"BACKGROUND Since August, 2019, US public health officials have been investigating a national outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). A spectrum of histological patterns consistent with acute to subacute lung injury has been seen in biopsies; however, autopsy findings have not been systematically characterised. We describe the pathological findings in autopsy and biopsy tissues submitted to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the evaluation of suspected EVALI. METHODS Between Aug 1, 2019, and Nov 30, 2019, we examined lung biopsy (n=10 individuals) and autopsy (n=13 individuals) tissue samples received by the CDC, submitted by 16 US states, from individuals with: a history of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use; respiratory, gastrointestinal, or constitutional symptoms; and either pulmonary infiltrates or opacities on chest imaging, or sudden death from an undetermined cause. We also reviewed medical records, evaluated histopathology, and performed infectious disease testing when indicated by histopathology and clinical history. FINDINGS 21 cases met surveillance case definitions for EVALI, with a further two cases of clinically suspected EVALI evaluated. All ten lung biopsies showed histological evidence of acute to subacute lung injury, including diffuse alveolar damage or organising pneumonia. These patterns were also seen in nine of 13 (69%) autopsy cases, most frequently diffuse alveolar damage (eight autopsies), but also acute and organising fibrinous pneumonia (one autopsy). Additional pulmonary pathology not necessarily consistent with EVALI was seen in the remaining autopsies, including bronchopneumonia, bronchoaspiration, and chronic interstitial lung disease. Three of the five autopsy cases with no evidence of, or a plausible alternative cause for acute lung injury, had been classified as confirmed or probable EVALI according to surveillance case definitions. INTERPRETATION Acute to subacute lung injury patterns were seen in all ten biopsies and most autopsy lung tissues from individuals with suspected EVALI. Acute to subacute lung injury can have numerous causes; however, if it is identified in an individual with a history of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use, and no alternative cause is apparent, a diagnosis of EVALI should be strongly considered. A review of autopsy tissue pathology in suspected EVALI deaths can also identify alternative diagnoses, which can enhance the specificity of public health surveillance efforts.

The potential life-long morbidity as a result of the infection and as a consequence of highly invasive critical care treatment needs to be factored into the rehabilitation of survivors. There are also many men whose lives will have been severely affected both physically and emotionally by the pandemic without ever contracting the disease, with the widespread disruption to normal existence and its impact on their social world and the economy. The implications of the closure of many healthcare services over the initial lockdown will also have both a shorter- and longer-term impact on other diseases due to missed early diagnosis and disrupted treatment regimes. Getting effective public health messages out to the population is critical and this current pandemic is demonstrating that there needs to be a more focused view on men's health behaviour. Without effective public support for preventative action the more likely the disease will continue its path unabated. This review explores the wider ramifications of the disease both for those men who have survived the disease and those that have been affected by the wider social effects of the pandemic. The pandemic should be a wake-up call for all involved in the planning and delivery of health and social care for the greater attention to the central role of sex and gender.","White, Alan",Postgraduate medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2020.1823760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32921214/,60
114161,Hapivirins and diprovirins: novel θ-defensin analogs with potent activity against influenza A virus.,2012,"This paper describes normative data for newly collected exemplar responses to 70 semantic categories described in previous norming studies (Battig & Montague, Journal of Experimental Psychology, 80(3, pt.2): 1-46, 1969; Van Overschelde, Rawson, & Dunlosky, Journal of Memory and Language, 50(3): 289-335, 2004; Yoon et al., Psychology and Aging, 19(3), 379-393, 2004). These categories were presented to 246 young (18-39 years), middle (40-59 years), and older (60 years and older) English-speaking adults living in the United States who were asked to generate as many category exemplars as possible for each of the 70 categories. In order to understand differences in normative responses, we analyzed these responses a) between age groups within the current sample and b) in comparison to three previously published sets of norms. Experimental studies using such norms typically assume invariance of normative likelihoods across age and historical time. We replicate previous findings such that exemplar frequency correlations suggest moderate stability in generated category members between age groups and cohorts for many, but not all, categories. Further, analyses of rank-order correlations highlight that the traditional measure of typicality may not capture all aspects of typicality, namely that for some categories there is high consistency in the frequency of exemplars across age groups and/or norms, but the ordering of those exemplars differs significantly. We include a cluster analysis to aid in grouping categories based on relative stability across time, cohort, and age groups. These results emphasize the importance of maintaining and updating age-differentiated category norms.","Castro, Nichol; Curley, Taylor; Hertzog, Christopher",Behavior research methods,https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-020-01454-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901344/,60

Although conventional vaccines are available, their protective efficacy is type or strain specific, and their production is time-consuming. For the control of an influenza pandemic in particular, agents that are immediately effective against a wide range of virus variants should be developed. Although pretreatment of various Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands have already been reported to be effective in the defense against subsequent IAV infection, the efficacy was limited to specific subtypes, and safety concerns were also raised. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of an attenuated bacterial outer membrane vesicle -harboring modified lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide (fmOMV) against IAV infection and the underlying mechanisms. Administration of fmOMV conferred significant protection against a lethal dose of pandemic H1N1, PR8, H5N2, and highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses; this broad antiviral activity was dependent on macrophages but independent of neutrophils. fmOMV induced recruitment and activation of macrophages and elicited type I IFNs. Intriguingly, fmOMV showed a more significant protective effect than other TLR ligands tested in previous reports, without exhibiting any adverse effect. These results show the potential of fmOMV as a prophylactic agent for the defense against influenza virus infection.","Bae, Eun-Hye; Seo, Sang Hwan; Kim, Chang-Ung; Jang, Min Seong; Song, Min-Suk; Lee, Tae-Young; Jeong, Yu-Jin; Lee, Moo-Seung; Park, Jong-Hwan; Lee, Pureum; Kim, Young Sang; Kim, Sang-Hyun; Kim, Doo-Jin",Journal of innate immunity,https://doi.org/10.1159/000494098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30844806/,60

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH An extensive review of existing literature on COVID-19 was conducted to ascertain the nature of the pandemic in prisons in sub-Saharan Africa. FINDINGS In line with empirical observations, the paper recommends regular disinfection of prisons and correctional facilities on the sub-continent. Again, there is the need for countries to resort to alternative punitive measures other than imprisonment, to curb the issue of overcrowding in prisons. Furthermore, there is the need for national governments to build ultramodern prison facilities, which would make room for emergency situations, as well as make provision for any future rise in the number of inmates while, at the same time, meeting fundamental needs as peculiar to prisoners. Finally, medical units in prisons need to be well-equipped against contemporary rise in COVID-19 cases.

Objective To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms, physical signs, and laboratory tests for suspected GCA. Data Sources PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched from November 1940 through April 5, 2020. Study Selection Trials and observational studies describing patients with suspected GCA, using an appropriate reference standard for GCA (temporal artery biopsy, imaging test, or clinical diagnosis), and with available data for at least 1 symptom, physical sign, or laboratory test. Data Extraction and Synthesis Screening, full text review, quality assessment, and data extraction by 2 investigators. Diagnostic test meta-analysis used a bivariate model. Main Outcome(s) and Measures Diagnostic accuracy parameters, including positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs). Results In 68 unique studies (14 037 unique patients with suspected GCA; of 7798 patients with sex reported, 5193 were women [66.6%]), findings associated with a diagnosis of GCA included limb claudication (positive LR, 6.01; 95% CI, 1.38-26.16), jaw claudication (positive LR, 4.90; 95% CI, 3.74-6.41), temporal artery thickening (positive LR, 4.70; 95% CI, 2.65-8.33), temporal artery loss of pulse (positive LR, 3.25; 95% CI, 2.49-4.23), platelet count of greater than 400 × 103/μL (positive LR, 3.75; 95% CI, 2.12-6.64), temporal tenderness (positive LR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.14-8.65), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 100 mm/h (positive LR, 3.11; 95% CI, 1.43-6.78). Findings that were associated with absence of GCA included the absence of erythrocyte sedimentation rate of greater than 40 mm/h (negative LR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.08-0.44), absence of C-reactive protein level of 2.5 mg/dL or more (negative LR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.25-0.59), and absence of age over 70 years (negative LR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.27-0.86). Conclusions and Relevance This study identifies the clinical and laboratory features that are most informative for a diagnosis of GCA, although no single feature was strong enough to confirm or refute the diagnosis if taken alone. Combinations of these symptoms might help direct further investigation, such as vascular imaging, temporal artery biopsy, or seeking evaluation for alternative diagnoses.","van der Geest, Kornelis S M; Sandovici, Maria; Brouwer, Elisabeth; Mackie, Sarah L",JAMA internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.3050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32804186/,60

As an unintentional consequence of greater prescription opioid utilization, there has been the parallel increase in misuse, abuse, and overdose, which are serious risks associated with all opioid analgesics. In response to these concerns, the Food and Drug Administration announced the requirement for a class-wide Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for long-acting and extended-release (ER) opioid analgesics in April 2011. An understanding of the details of this REMS will be of particular importance to primary care providers. The class-wide REMS is focused on educating health care providers and patients on appropriate prescribing and safe use of ER opioids. Support from primary care will be necessary for the success of this REMS, as these clinicians are the predominant providers of care and the main prescribers of opioid analgesics for patients with chronic pain. Although currently voluntary, future policy will likely dictate that providers undergo mandatory training to continue prescribing medications within this class. This article outlines the elements of the class-wide REMS for ER opioids and clarifies the impact on primary care providers with regard to training, patient education, and clinical practice.","Gudin, Jeffrey A",Therapeutics and clinical risk management,https://doi.org/10.2147/tcrm.s28764; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22570553/,60

Many studies have demonstrated the efficacy of ketamine in reducing depressive symptoms in adults with treatment-resistant mood disorders, though few studies utilizing ketamine in youth populations exist. This systematic review examines the current state of evidence for ketamine use in children with treatment-resistant mood disorders. We conducted a search utilizing two electronic databases for English-language studies investigating the therapeutic effects and side effect profile of ketamine in youth ≤ 19 years of age with a diagnosis of a treatment-resistant mood disorder. Analysis included subjects with treatment-resistant depression with and without psychotic features and with bipolar disorder. Primary outcome measures included the following scales: Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Children's Depression Rating Scale, Children's Depression Rating Scale Revised, Child Bipolar Questionnaire, Overt Aggression Scale, Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, and Scale for Suicidal Ideation. Four published studies were identified that investigated therapeutic ketamine use in youth for the primary purpose of treating a treatment-resistant psychiatric disorder. Three additional studies that did not meet eligibility criteria were identified and discussed. Ketamine was shown in youth to generally improve depressive symptoms, decrease acute suicidality, and reduce mood lability, though a number of subjects remained resistant to its treatment. These findings substantiate the need for further longitudinal studies investigating ketamine's long-term safety, its efficacy, and abuse potential in the youth.","Kim, Susan; Rush, Brittany S; Rice, Timothy R",European child & adolescent psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-020-01542-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385697/,60

However, thyroid antibodies have been repeatedly hypothesized to play a role in specific forms of mood disorders. Potentially related forms include treatment-refractory cases, severe or atypical depression, and depression at specific phases of a woman's life (early gestation, postpartum depression, perimenopausal). With regard to bipolar disorder, studies of specific subgroups (rapid cycling, mixed, or depressive bipolar) have reported associations with thyroid antibodies. Offspring of bipolar subjects were found more vulnerable to develop thyroid antibodies independently from the vulnerability to develop psychiatric disorders. A twin study suggested thyroid antibodies among possible endophenotypes for bipolar disorder. Severe encephalopathies have been reported in association with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Cases with pure psychiatric presentation are being reported, the antithyroid antibodies being probably markers of some other autoimmune disorders affecting the brain. Vasculitis resulting in abnormalities in cortical perfusion is one of the possible mechanisms.","Bocchetta, Alberto; Traccis, Francesco; Mosca, Enrica; Serra, Alessandra; Tamburini, Giorgio; Loviselli, Andrea",International journal of bipolar disorders,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40345-016-0046-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26869176/,60

METHODS We compared the accuracy and precision of a non-invasive cardiac output (NICO) monitor and of thermodilution with those of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to measure CO in 50 patients who underwent elective valvoplasty to treat TR (26 mild and 24 moderate-to-severe) and in 25 normal controls (without TR). We used TEE as a reference method to measure CO and to intraoperatively grade TR. RESULTS The differences between NICO monitor and TEE measurements in patients without TR and in those with mild and with moderate-to-severe TR were -0.17 +/- 0.88 (n = 150, r (2) = 0.75), -0.16 +/- 0.82 (n = 158, r (2) = 0.78), and 0.17 +/- 0.91 L/min (n = 155, r (2) = 0.78), respectively. The differences between bolus thermodilution cardiac output and TEE measurements in patients without TR and in those with mild and with moderate-to-severe TR were -0.08 +/- 0.55 (r (2) = 0.88), 0.05 +/- 0.61 (r (2) = 0.86), and 0.43 +/- 1.37 L/min (r (2) = 0.58), respectively. CONCLUSION These findings demonstrate that measuring CO using the thermodilution technique is less accurate in patients with moderate-to-severe TR and that the NICO monitor is more accurate for such patients. We postulate that the NICO monitor measures CO more accurately and reproducibly than thermodilution in patients with coexisting TR.","Imakiire, Naka; Omae, Takeshi; Matsunaga, Akira; Sakata, Ryuzo; Kanmura, Yuichi",Journal of anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-010-0951-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20490574/,60
121345,Case Report of Transmissible Gastroenteritis Coronavirus Infection Associated with Small Intestine and Brain Lesions in Piglets.,2019,"Perivascularly implanted matrix embedded endothelial cells (MEECs) are potent regulators of inflammation and intimal hyperplasia following vascular injuries. Endothelial cells (ECs) in collagen scaffolds adopt a reparative phenotype with significant therapeutic potential. Although the biology of MEECs is increasingly understood, tuning of scaffold properties to control cell-substrate interactions is less well-studied. It is hypothesized that modulating scaffold degradation would change EC phenotype. Scaffolds with differential degradation are prepared by cross-linking and predegradation. Vascular injury increases degradation and the presence of MEECs retards injury-mediated degradation. MEECs respond to differential scaffold properties with altered viability in vivo, suppressed smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation in vitro, and altered interleukin-6 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression. When implanted perivascularly to a murine carotid wire injury, tuned scaffolds change MEEC effects on vascular repair and inflammation. Live animal imaging enables real-time tracking of cell viability, inflammation, and scaffold degradation, affording an unprecedented understanding of interactions between cells, substrate, and tissue. MEEC-treated injuries improve endothelialization and reduce SMC hyperplasia over 14 d. These data demonstrate the potent role material design plays in tuning MEEC efficacy in vivo, with implications for the design of clinical therapies.","Unterman, Shimon; Freiman, Alina; Beckerman, Margarita; Abraham, Eytan; Stanley, James R L; Levy, Ela; Artzi, Natalie; Edelman, Elazer",Advanced healthcare materials,https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.201500457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26333178/,60

AIM In this paper, we discussed the psychological wellbeing of children during the COVID-19 outbreak through the art-based qualitative study using the drawing method among children in Iraqi Kurdistan. METHODS In this qualitative arts-based research study, 15 children aged 6 to 13 years old who were confined at home during the COVID-19 outbreak for at least 1 month were included following obtaining the consent from their parents. The children were asked to draw his/her feelings, reflections, and responses during the COVID-19 on a paper. The children were guided to paint their reflections during the COVID-19 based on the following criteria: if they experienced loneliness, tiredness, insomnia, depression, worry or anxiety, or have behavior changes and their relationship with their parents and other siblings. RESULTS This study showed that children have a high level of stress at home during the COVID-19 outbreak. The children had great fear about the coronavirus. They experienced loneliness and stress, and felt sad, depressed due to home confinement and social distancing. The possibility of infection by coronavirus has occupied their entire mind.

Because of its generalizability, the MV design has been widely adopted by the visualization community to help users examine and interact with large, complex, and high-dimensional data. However, although ubiquitous, there has been little work to categorize and analyze MVs in order to better understand its design space. As a result, there has been little to no guideline in how to use the MV design effectively. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of how MVs are designed in practice. We focus on two fundamental measures of multiple-view patterns: composition, which quantifies what view types and how many are there; and configuration, which characterizes spatial arrangement of view layouts in the display space. We build a new dataset containing 360 images of MVs collected from IEEE VIS, EuroVis, and PacificVis publications 2011 to 2019, and make fine-grained annotations of view types and layouts for these visualization images. From this data we conduct composition and configuration analyses using quantitative metrics of term frequency and layout topology. We identify common practices around MVs, including relationship of view types, popular view layouts, and correlation between view types and layouts. We combine the findings into a MV recommendation system, providing interactive tools to explore the design space, and support example-based design.","Chen, Xi; Zeng, Wei; Lin, Yanna; Al-Maneea, Hayder Mahdi; Roberts, Jonathan; Chang, Remco",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33048683/,60

The clinical signs of infection appeared in newborn piglets, including medium morbidity and low mortality rates. Rectal swabs were collected from five different affected litters for laboratory examinations. Samples from two dead piglets and two euthanized affected piglets were collected for gross and histopathological examinations. All fecal samples were tested TGEV positive by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Necropsy revealed nonspecific gross lesions. The histopathological examinations revealed villi fused with denuded tips and severe villus atrophy, leading to extensive epithelial flattening in middle and lower small intestine. The architecture pattern of villi presented columnar and cuboidal poorly differentiated enterocytes with mild subepithelial edema. In some enterocytes, pycnotic nuclei were detected. Microscopic examination of brain tissue revealed diffuse gliosis in the area of pia matter with mild congestion of the meningeal and parenchymal vessels and neuronal degeneration. In conclusion, this case study reported an epidemic TGEV infection in piglets, characterized by low mortality and medium morbidity rates accompanied by typical histopathological lesions in small intestine, as well as by coexisting brain lesions, that are described for the first time.","Papatsiros, Vasileios G; Stylianaki, Ioanna; Papakonstantinou, Georgios; Papaioannou, Nikolaos; Christodoulopoulos, Georgios",Viral immunology,https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2018.0095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30207926/,60

The aim of this study was to look at the outcomes of VSC and its role in the post COVID era. METHODS Prospective outcomes were collected for all patients referred to the VSC over a 6-year period (March 2014-April 2020). VSC is led by specialist stone nurses for on-going surveillance of KSD patients. RESULTS A total of 290 patients were seen (468 individual appointments; 1.6±1.0 per patient), with a mean age of 57.0±15.8 years (range:17-92) and a male:female ratio of 3:2. The referral was for surveillance of asymptomatic small renal stones (230,79.3%); history of recurrent stone disease (45,15.5%); solitary kidneys (5,1.7%); cystine stones, young age and other conditions (10,3.4%). The mean stone size was 5.0±2.7 mm, followed-up with XR KUB (225,77.6%) and USS (65,22.4%), for median duration of 12 months (range: 3-24 months). At the end, 132(45.6%) remained in VSC, 106(36.6%) were discharged, 47(16.2%) returned to face-to-face clinic or treatment, and 5(1.7%) had emergency admissions. Of 47 patients that returned, 23(48.9%) developed new symptoms, 21(44.6%) had stone growth, and 3 defaulted to face-to-face appointment. Thirty-five patients needed surgical intervention (URS-21, SWL-12 and PCNL-1) and 10 were managed conservatively. VSC reduced the cost per clinic appointment from £27.9 to £2/patient (93% reduction), equating to a total saving of £12,006 over the study period. CONCLUSION Nurse led VSC not only provided a safe follow-up, but also allowed to substantially reduce the cost of treatment by allowing patients to be either discharged or return to a face-to-face clinic or surgical intervention if needed. Post COVID, this model using telemedicine will have a much wider uptake and further help optimise healthcare resources.","Hughes, Thomas; Pietropaolo, Amelia; Archer, Matthew; Davis, Tania; Tear, Loretta; Somani, Bhaskar K",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2020.0708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32731751/,60

With its increasing global roles and broad range of regulatory responsibilities in ensuring the availability, safety, and security of medical and food products, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is engaged in a range of efforts in support of global health security. This article provides an overview of FDA's global health security roles, focusing on its responsibilities related to the development and use of medical countermeasures (MCMs) for preventing, detecting, and responding to global infectious disease and other public health emergency threats.

However, letters written by Inuit patients in Indian hospitals and their kin, and which were addressed to government officials and translated by government employees, challenge this assumption. By focusing on the harmful effects of the segregation and long-term detainment of Inuit peoples away from their communities, the letters theorize TB treatment as multiply harmful and iatrogenic. The letters also showcase how Inuit peoples resisted Indian Hospital treatment and articulated the need for care and treatment to occur within a network of intimate relations, rather than in distant sanatoriums.","Granzow, Kara",Anthropology & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/13648470.2021.1929832; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34169780/,60

Its lossless compression is pretty critical, which directly determines the requirement of local storage space and communication bandwidth of remote medical systems, so as to help the diagnosis and treatment of patients. There are two extraordinary properties related to medical images: lossless and similarity. How to take advantage of these two properties to reduce the information needed to represent an image is the key point of compression. In this paper, we employ the big data mining to set up the image codebook. That is, to find the basic components of images. We propose a soft compression algorithm for multi-component medical images, which can exactly reflect the fundamental structure of images. A general representation framework for image compression is also put forward and the results indicate that our developed soft compression algorithm can outperform the popular benchmarks PNG and JPEG2000 in terms of compression ratio.","Xin, Gangtao; Fan, Pingyi",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91920-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117350/,60
125803,Prediction of cross-clade HIV-1 T-cell epitopes using immunoinformatics analysis.,2018,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The introduction of liquid embolic agents has revolutionized endovascular approach to cranial vascular malformations. The aim of the study was to retrospectively assess the efficacy and safety of Precipitating Hydrophobic Injectable Liquid (PHIL), a new nonadhesive liquid embolic agent, in the treatment of patients with cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. The primary end point was the rate of complete occlusion of dural arteriovenous fistulas. Secondary end points included the incidence of adverse events and clinical status at 3-month follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective multicenter study. Twenty-six consecutive patients with dural arteriovenous fistulas (de novo or previously treated) treated by injection of PHIL only or with PHIL in combination with other embolization products (such as Onyx or detachable coils) were included in the study. Recruitment started in August 2014 and ended in September 2015. RESULTS Twenty-two (85%) patients were treated with PHIL only, with 3 patients treated with both PHIL and Onyx, and 1, with both PHIL and coils. Immediate complete angiographic occlusion was achieved in 20 (77%) patients. Of the 6 patients with residual fistulas, 3 were retreated with PHIL and 1 achieved angiographic cure. An adverse event was seen in 1 patient who developed worsening of preexisting ataxia due to acute thrombosis of the draining vein. CONCLUSIONS PHIL appears to be safe and effective for endovascular treatment of cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. Short-term angiographic and clinical results are comparable with those of Onyx, with the added advantage of easier preparation and improved homogeneous cast visualization. The use of iodine as a radio-opacifier also produces considerably less artifacts on CT compared with tantalum-based embolic materials.","Lamin, S; Chew, H S; Chavda, S; Thomas, A; Piano, M; Quilici, L; Pero, G; Holtmannspolter, M; Cronqvist, M E; Casasco, A; Guimaraens, L; Paul, L; Gil Garcia, A; Aleu, A; Chapot, R",AJNR.

Coronavirus's morbidity and its status as a global pandemic transmittable from one person to another has subsequently intensified the personal perception of distress. The projected shortage of vital medical equipment to fight coronavirus due to daily increases in COVID-19 cases creates social unrest. The world confronts perpetual news about high numbers of coronavirus cases, more people in quarantine, and more deaths; those not infected feel increasing fear about its proximity. Social media, print media, and electronic sources offer much advice on how to prevent coronavirus infection. Pandemics extend beyond pathophysiology and medical phenomena to associations with intense psychosocial impact. Studies have established that people with existing mental disorders are prone to relapses, the fear of faulty COVID-19 prevention measures, distress, and suicidal thoughts during pandemics. Precautionary measures aim to slow the spread of coronavirus, but these radical repetitive measures create great anxiety in the mental health of individuals suffering from OCD. Despite the nature of their conditions, these people must adhere to routine processes, such as washing hands, wearing masks and gloves, and sanitizing hands. Given the asymptomatic nature of people suffering from OCD, the routine measures for addressing COVID-19 have a hectic and adverse effect on their mental health and their state of relaxation. Through a systematic literature review, this paper provides insight into the coronavirus pandemic's implications for OCD symptoms.","Sulaimani, Mona F; Bagadood, Nizar H",Reviews on environmental health,https://doi.org/10.1515/reveh-2020-0054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32866131/,60

MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventy-nine consecutive patients (54.5 ± 11.2 years old) with 114 breast cancer metastases (28.9 ± 16.1 mm in diameter), involving the lungs, the liver, and/or the bone, were treated using PTA with a curative intent. The goal was to achieve a complete remission in association with systemic chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. We retrospectively evaluated the prognostic factors associated with 1- and 2-year local control and the 1- and 2-year DFS rates. RESULTS The 1- and 2-year local control rates were 83.0 and 76.1 %, respectively. Tumor burden was associated with a poorer outcome for local control after PTA (HR 1.027 by additional millimeter, p = 0.026; >4 cm HR 3.90). The 1- and 2-year DFS rates were 54.2 and 30.4 %, respectively. In multivariate analysis, triple-negative histological subtype and increased size of treated metastases were associated with a poorer DFS (HR 2.22; 95 % CI [1.13-4.36]; p = 0.02 and HR 2.43; 95 % CI [1.22-4.82]; p = 0.011, respectively). CONCLUSION PTA is effective for local control of breast cancer oligometastases.

The use of chemical fertilizer in agriculture, safe water and food, and improved sanitation and hygiene also contributed to the near eradication of endemic parasites. However, parasite infections continued to affect children mostly in resource-limited countries, of which the African continent has one of the highest burdens of diseases. The application of school-based approaches has several advantages where the structure of healthcare systems is not optimal. In Africa, soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomiasis are frequently targets for school-based public health intervention. Mass drug administration (MDA) by teachers at school can reach targeted children effectively and safely. Limitations of this approach include missing unattended children and absentee of teachers. Initially, MDA at school for parasitic infections was thought to improve health and even socioeconomic status of children in the community. However, more recently the socioeconomic impact has been questioned although the reduction of parasitic diseases is still apparent. Moreover, other basic public health measurements such as increased toilet use, assuring safe water access and avoiding human excrement as agricultural fertilizers, are equally important for control and prevention of parasitic diseases. Further global efforts should be continued to achieve equal health to every child in a sustainable way.","Horikoshi, Yuho; Ibrahim, Usman Muhammad; Morris, Shaun K",Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/ped.14535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33174267/,60

Methods A systematic search was conducted in bibliographic databases including PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection for English articles published from 1998 to 2018. The PICO strategy guided the assessment of study relevance and the bibliographical search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs in which (1) participants were adult workers with physically demanding work and MSD (including specific and non-specific MSD and musculoskeletal pain, symptoms, and discomfort), (2) interventions were initiated and/or carried out at the workplace, (3) a comparison group was included, and (4) a measure of MSD was reported (including musculoskeletal pain, symptoms, prevalence or discomfort). The quality assessment and evidence synthesis adhered to the guidelines developed by the Institute for Work & Health (Toronto, Canada) focusing on developing practical recommendations for stakeholders. Relevant stakeholders were engaged in the review process. Results Level of evidence from 54 high and medium quality studies showed moderate evidence of a positive effect of physical exercise. Within this domain, there was strong evidence of a positive effect of workplace strength training. There was limited evidence for ergonomics and strong evidence for no benefit of participatory ergonomics, multifaceted interventions, and stress management. No intervention domains were associated with ""negative effects"". Conclusions The evidence synthesis recommends that implementing strength training at the workplace can reduce MSD among workers with physically demanding work. In regard to workplace ergonomics, there was not enough evidence from the scientific literature to guide current practices. Based on the scientific literature, participatory ergonomics and multifaceted workplace interventions seem to have no beneficial effect on reducing MSD among this group of workers. As these interventional domains were very heterogeneous, it should also be recognized that general conclusions about their effectiveness should be done with care.Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42018116752 (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=116752).","Sundstrup, Emil; Seeberg, Karina Glies Vincents; Bengtsen, Elizabeth; Andersen, Lars Louis",Journal of occupational rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10926-020-09879-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32219688/,60

However, the metabolic response of a non-diabetic cohort to metformin treatment has not been studied. Here, we show in C. elegans and human primary cells that metformin shortens lifespan when provided in late life, contrary to its positive effects in young organisms. We find that metformin exacerbates ageing-associated mitochondrial dysfunction, causing respiratory failure. Age-related failure to induce glycolysis and activate the dietary-restriction-like mobilization of lipid reserves in response to metformin result in lethal ATP exhaustion in metformin-treated aged worms and late-passage human cells, which can be rescued by ectopic stabilization of cellular ATP content. Metformin toxicity is alleviated in worms harbouring disruptions in insulin-receptor signalling, which show enhanced resilience to mitochondrial distortions at old age. Together, our data show that metformin induces deleterious changes of conserved metabolic pathways in late life, which could bring into question its benefits for older individuals without diabetes.","Espada, Lilia; Dakhovnik, Alexander; Chaudhari, Prerana; Martirosyan, Asya; Miek, Laura; Poliezhaieva, Tetiana; Schaub, Yvonne; Nair, Ashish; Döring, Nadia; Rahnis, Norman; Werz, Oliver; Koeberle, Andreas; Kirkpatrick, Joanna; Ori, Alessandro; Ermolaeva, Maria A",Nature metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-020-00307-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33139960/,60

Previous studies have shown that the TGEV can lead to severe diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration in 2-week-old piglets and weaned piglets, resulting in a large number of piglet deaths. Antimicrobial peptides have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and a strong killing effect on bacteria, especially on the drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria, and it has attracted broad concern. However, there are very few reports on the effect of APB-13 (an antimicrobial peptide) on the intestinal microbes of piglets infected with TGEV. In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to compare the microbial phylum and the genus of piglet's enteric microorganism in different experimental groups, and to predict the metabolic function of the microbial flora. At the same time, the apparent digestibility of nutrients, digestive enzyme activity, daily weight gain and survival rate were also measured. TGEV infection could cause the imbalance of intestinal microbes in piglets, and increase of the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, and decrease of the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteri. With the addition of APB-13, this problem can be alleviated, which can reduce the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and improve the balance of intestinal microorganisms. At the microbial genus level, after adding APB-13, the relative abundance of Catenibacterium, Enterobacter and Streptococcus in the intestinal tract of piglets infected with TGEV showed significant decrease, while the relative abundance of Lactobacillus and Ruminococcus increased. Finally, we found that APB-13 can significantly increase the activity of digestive enzyme in the intestinal tract of piglet, thereby improving the apparent digestibility of nutrients and the growth performance of piglets. This study demonstrates that APB-13 can alleviate the adverse outcomes caused by TGEV infection by correcting the intestinal microbial disorders.","Liang, Xiuli; Wang, Pengtao; Lian, Kaiqi; Han, Fangfang; Tang, Yajie; Zhang, Shouming; Zhang, Wenju",Journal of animal physiology and animal nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1111/jpn.13555; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075636/,60

Time-sensitive treatments such as stroke interventions benefit from methodically developed protocols. Clearly defined roles in these protocols allow for parallel processing of tasks, resulting in consistent delivery of care. OBJECTIVE To present the outcomes of a quality-improvement (QI) process directed at reducing stroke treatment times in a tertiary level academic medical center. METHODS A Six-Sigma-based QI process was developed over a 3-month period. After an initial analysis, procedures were implemented and fine-tuned to identify and address rate-limiting steps in the endovascular care pathway. Prospectively recorded treatment times were then compared in two groups of patients who were treated 'before' (n=64) or 'after' (n=30) the QI process. Three time intervals were measured: emergency room (ER) to arrival for CT scan (ER-CT), CT scan to interventional laboratory arrival (CT-Lab), and interventional laboratory arrival to groin puncture (Lab-puncture). RESULTS The ER-CT time was 40 (±29) min in the 'before' and 26 (±15) min in the 'after' group (p=0.008). The CT-Lab time was 87 (±47) min in the 'before' and 51 (±33) min in the 'after' group (p=0.0002). The Lab-puncture time was 24 (±11) min in the 'before' and 15 (±4) min in the 'after' group (p<0.0001). The overall ER-arrival to groin-puncture time was reduced from 2 h, 31 min (±51) min in the 'before' to 1 h, 33 min (±37) min in the 'after' group, (p<0.0001). The improved times were seen for both working hours and off-hours interventions.

This sub-inquiry aimed to understand the experiences of persons with a history of substance use and incarceration in the Fraser East region of BC and how involvement with the criminal justice system affected their drug use and perceived risk of overdose. METHODS The Fraser East Overdose Response project utilized a community-based participatory action approach that included peer researchers with lived experience in all parts of the research process. This qualitative pilot study aimed to better understand individuals at risk of an unwitnessed overdose in order to prevent deaths and identify effective local responses. A snowball sampling technique was used to recruit persons aged 19 and over who used illicit drugs over the past 3 years in the Fraser East since 2016. In total, 22 participants were interviewed. Of these, 13 participants identified a history of incarceration. Interviews were analyzed using a framework analysis approach. RESULTS The perspectives that participants shared revealed that impacts from incarceration are influenced by policies but also highly individualized. Our inquiry found three broader themes, within which were situated differing and sometimes conflicting interpretations and experiences of systemic environments: (1) incarceration was associated with harms and was perceived to increase risk of overdose following release, (2) incarceration was perceived to have limited impact on substance use and overdose risk, and (3) incarceration was associated with a perceived reduction of substance use and overdose risk. CONCLUSIONS Understanding the complexities of the perceptions of those with lived experience of substance use and incarceration is of importance to better inform interventions in this population. The existing knowledge base urgently requires further inquiry into the intersections between qualitative perspectives, environments and policies, and quantitative outcomes of overdose vís-a-vís correctional institution.","McCaughran-Contreras, Celine; Fernando, Saranee; Sikora, Mike; Hawkins, Jennifer; Kniseley, Marinel; Snyder, Daniel; Long, Connie; Robson, James; Slaunwhite, Amanda; Salmon, Amy",Harm reduction journal,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-021-00525-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34320983/,60

To address these bottlenecks, I propose the use of 24-meric ferritin for the synthesis of mosaic nanocages to deliver a cocktail of antibodies or nanobodies alone or in combination with another therapeutic, like a nucleotide analogue, to mimic the viral entry process and deceive the virus, or to develop mosaic vaccines.

We present our experience of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transplant patients in one of the most affected parts of the UK with direct comparison to waitlisted patients. METHODS A single-center prospective study of symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive waitlisted and transplant patients was undertaken to compare these groups and assess clinical outcomes. RESULTS A total of 60 consecutive symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were identified with 32 active waitlisted patients and 28 functioning renal transplants. Demographics were similar. The incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in the waitlisted group was 9.9% compared to 1.9% in renal transplant patients (P < 0.001). Immunosuppression did not influence initial symptomology. Fifteen percent of patients in the waitlisted and 32% in the transplant groups died (P = 0.726). Mortality as proportion of total waitlisted (321 patients) and transplant population (1434 patients) of our centre was 1.5% and 0.6% (P < 0.001), respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) at 48 h and peak CRP were associated with mortality in both groups while quick sequential organ failure assessment score at 48 h (P = 0.036) was associated with mortality for transplant patients. CONCLUSIONS Incidence of COVID-19 is higher in the waitlisted population but transplant patients have more severe disease, reflected by higher mortality. CRP at 48 h can be used as a predictive tool. In the absence of effective treatments, the current strategy of shielding is arguably the most important factor in protecting patients while resuming transplantation.","Mohamed, Ismail H; Chowdary, Prashanth B; Shetty, Shraddha; Sammartino, Cinzia; Sivaprakasam, Rajesh; Lindsey, Ben; Thuraisingham, Raj; Yaqoob, Muhammad M; Khurram, Muhammad A",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33350626/,60

It formulates a professional educational relationship between a staff nurse (preceptor) and student nurse and is based on the provision of providing patient care. Preceptorship is widely acknowledged in the literature as a positive pedagogical approach in clinical nursing education in terms of knowledge and skill acquisition, confidence, and professional socialisation of undergraduate nursing students. However, the literature also widely reports negative interpersonal experiences within this professional educational relationship resulting in negative educational experiences and in some cases, negative patient experiences. Therefore, the authors set out to examine what teaching strategies are being implemented by nurse educators to encourage the development of interpersonal and communication skills in facilitating positive interpersonal relationships between the preceptor, nursing student and patient. This paper outlines the protocol for an exploratory scoping review that aims to systematically and comprehensively map out the available published and unpublished literature on the teaching strategies to develop interpersonal and communication skills in preceptorship education and training programmes. To conduct a systematic and comprehensive scoping review, the review will be guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute and Arksey & O' Malley (2005) six-stage iterative framework, as well as PRISMA-ScR framework guidelines, to ensure the quality of the methodological and reporting approaches to the review. It is anticipated that the results of the scoping review will inform nurse educators on the current educational practices for developing interpersonal and communication skills in preceptorship education and training programmes and identify any educational practices that are worthy of further consideration for future research.","Hardie, Philip; Darley, Andrew; Redmond, Catherine; Lafferty, Attracta; Jarvis, Suzi",HRB open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13201.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33665546/,60

It relies on the precise organization of nanomaterials to achieve unique functionality. There are no interactions more elegant than those governing nucleic acids via Watson-Crick base-pairing rules. The infinite combinations of DNA/RNA base pairs and their remarkable molecular recognition capability can give rise to interesting nanostructures that are only limited by our imagination. Over the past years, creative assembly of nucleic acids has fashioned a plethora of two-dimensional and three-dimensional nanostructures with precisely controlled size, shape and spatial functionalization. These nanostructures have been precisely patterned with molecules, proteins and gold nanoparticles for the observation of chemical reactions at the single molecule level, activation of enzymatic cascade and novel modality of photonic detection, respectively. Recently, they have also been engineered to encapsulate and release bioactive agents in a stimulus-responsive manner for therapeutic applications. The future of nucleic acid-based nanoengineering is bright and exciting.

Titers determined by this method demonstrated an excellent correlation with the results of neutralization test. Testing of serum potency with a panel of type 1 poliovirus strains altered antigenically was used to evaluate the composition of polyclonal sera with respect to the epitope specificity of constituent antibodies. Paratope profiles of various polyclonal sera determined by this new method differed, depending on the type of vaccine used for immunization. Antibodies induced in response to inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) contained antibodies directed primarily against antigenic site 1, while sera from recipients of the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) contained antibodies to site 3. Antibodies to antigenic sites 2 and 4 were minor constituents in both types of sera. Pre-immunization sera had paratope profiles similar to OPV-induced antisera, allowing the discrimination between antibodies induced by IPV and maternal antibodies.

148303,Respiratory syncytial virus induces host RNA stress granules to facilitate viral replication.,2010,"BACKGROUND For any new vaginal dosage form, the distribution and retention in the vagina has to be assessed by in vivo evaluation. We evaluated the vaginal distribution and retention of starch-based pellets in sheep as live animal model by gamma scintigraphy (using Indium-111 DTPA as radiolabel) and in women via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, using a gadolinium chelate as contrast agent). A conventional cream formulation was used as reference in both studies. METHOD Cream and pellets were administered to sheep (n=6) in a two period-two treatment study and to healthy female volunteers (n=6) via a randomized crossover trial. Pellets (filled into hard gelatin capsule) and cetomacrogol cream, both labeled with Indium-111 DTPA (for gamma scintigraphy) or with gadolinium chelate (for MRI) were evaluated for their intravaginal distribution and retention over a 24h period. Spreading in the vagina was assessed based on the part of the vagina covered with formulation (expressed in relation to the total vaginal length). Vaginal retention of the formulation was quantified based on the radioactivity remaining in the vaginal area (sheep study), or qualitatively evaluated (women study). RESULTS Both trials indicated a rapid distribution of the cream within the vagina as complete coverage of the vaginal mucosa was seen 1h after dose administration. Clearance of the cream was rapid: about 10% activity remained in the vaginal area of the sheep 12h post-administration, while after 8h only a thin layer of cream was detected on the vaginal mucosa of women. After disintegration of the hard gelatin capsule, the pellet formulation gradually distributed over the entire vaginal mucosa. Residence time of the pellets in the vagina was longer compared to the semi-solid formulation: after 24h 23 ± 7% radioactivity was detected in the vaginal area of the sheep, while in women the pellet formulation was still detected throughout the vagina. CONCLUSION A multi-particulate system containing starch-based pellets was identified as a promising novel vaginal drug delivery system, resulting in complete coverage of the vaginal mucosa and long retention time.","Mehta, Samata; Verstraelen, Hans; Peremans, Kathelijne; Villeirs, Geert; Vermeire, Simon; De Vos, Filip; Mehuys, Els; Remon, Jean Paul; Vervaet, Chris",International journal of pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2012.01.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22265911/,60

Nevertheless, research on beliefs about maternal sensitivity is still scarce, to an even greater extent in the context of child disability. This inquiry aimed to describe beliefs about sensitive parenting among mothers of children with developmental disabilities and to examine how those beliefs relate to sociodemographic factors and perceived stress. Participants included 40 mothers with a child up to 7 years of age with a developmental disability. Mothers reported on sociodemographic factors and daily hassles and sorted an adapted version of the Maternal Behavior Q-Sort. Results revealed a strong convergence between maternal beliefs about the ideal mother and the attachment theory's concept of sensitivity. Daily hassles predicted beliefs about the ideal mother.

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted in a PICU in Brazil. All patients aged 6 months to 18 years admitted with a diagnosis of sepsis were eligible for inclusion. Those with ferritin and C-reactive protein measured within 48 h and lactate and leukocytes within 24 h of admission were included in the prognostic performance analysis. RESULTS Of 350 eligible patients with sepsis, 294 had undergone all measurements required for analysis and were included in the study. PIM2, ferritin, lactate, and CRP had good discriminatory power for mortality, with PIM2 and ferritin being superior to CRP. The cutoff values for PIM2 (> 14%), ferritin (> 135 ng/mL), lactate (> 1.7 mmol/L), and CRP (> 6.7 mg/mL) were associated with mortality. The combination of ferritin, lactate, and CRP had a positive predictive value of 43% for mortality, similar to that of PIM2 alone (38.6%). The combined use of the three biomarkers plus PIM2 increased the positive predictive value to 76% and accuracy to 0.945. CONCLUSIONS PIM2, ferritin, lactate, and CRP alone showed good prognostic performance for mortality in pediatric patients older than 6 months with sepsis. When combined, they were able to predict death in three-fourths of the patients with sepsis. Total leukocyte count was not useful as a prognostic marker.","Tonial, Cristian Tedesco; Costa, Caroline Abud Drumond; Andrades, Gabriela Rupp Hanzen; Crestani, Francielly; Bruno, Francisco; Piva, Jefferson Pedro; Garcia, Pedro Celiny Ramos",Jornal de pediatria,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jped.2020.07.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991837/,60
148744,Memory CD4 T cells direct protective responses to influenza virus in the lungs through helper-independent mechanisms.,2010,"OBJECTIVES The Norwegian Cardiac Arrest Registry (NorCAR) was established in 2013 when cardiac arrest became a mandatory reportable condition. The aim of this cohort study is to describe how the world's first mandatory, population-based cardiac arrest registry evolved during its first 6 years. SETTING Norway has a total population of 5.3 million inhabitants with a population density that varies considerably. All residents are assigned a unique identifier number, giving nationally approved registries access to information about all births and deaths in the country. Data in the registry are entered by data processors; public employees with close links to the emergency medical services. All data processors undergo a standardised training and meet for yearly retraining and updates. PARTICIPANTS All events of cardiac arrest where bystanders or healthcare professionals have started cardiopulmonary resuscitation or performed defibrillation are included into the NorCAR. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Since the establishment of the registry, the number of reporting health trusts, the number of reported events and the corresponding population at risk were followed year by year. Outcome is measured as changes in inclusion rate, incidence per 100 000 inhabitants and survival to 30 days after cardiac arrest. RESULTS In total, 14 849 cases were registered over 6 years, between 2013 and 2018. The number of health trusts reporting rose steadily from 2013. Within 3 years, all trusts reported to the registry with an increasing number of events reported; going from 1101 to 3400 per year. The prevalence of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation increased slightly, but the population incidence of survival did not change. CONCLUSION Declaring cardiac arrest as a reportable condition and close follow-up of all reporting areas is essential when building a national registry.","Tjelmeland, Ingvild Beathe Myrhaugen; Alm-Kruse, Kristin; Andersson, Lars-Jøran; Bratland, Ståle; Hafstad, Arne-Ketil; Haug, Bjørn; Langørgen, Jørund; Larsen, Alf Inge; Lindner, Thomas Werner; Nilsen, Jan Erik; Olasveengen, Theresa M; Soreide, Eldar; Skogvoll, Eirik; Kramer-Johansen, Jo",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-038133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32641339/,60

This study developed a wearable plantar pressure force measurement and analysis (WPPFMA) system based on a flexible sensor matrix film to monitor plantar pressure force in real time. The developed system comprised a flexible sensor matrix film embedded in the insole of the shoe, a wearable data acquisition (DAQ) device with a Bluetooth module, and dedicated software with an intuitive graphical user interface for displaying the plantar pressure force data from receivers by using a terminal unit (laptop or smart-phone). The flexible sensor matrix film integrated 16 piezoresistive cell sensors to detect pressure force at different anatomical zones of the plantar and under different body positions. The signals from the flexible sensor matrix film were collected using the DAQ module embedded in the shoe and transmitted to the receivers through Bluetooth. The real-time display and analysis software can monitor, visualize, and record the detailed plantar pressure force data, such as average pressure force, maximum pressure force, and pressure force distributions and variations over time. The outcomes of the trials in which the system was worn revealed the applicability of the developed WPPFMA system for monitoring plantar pressure force under static and dynamic wearing conditions. The plantar pressure force data derived from this system provide valuable insights for personal foot care, gait analysis, and clinical diagnosis.","Zhao, Shumi; Liu, Rong; Fei, Chengwei; Zia, Abdul Wasy; Jing, Lingxiao",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764796/,60

From a gender-based standpoint, the article contends that it is necessary to note that cis heteronormative male socialization is guided by three core issues: 1) the submission to practices of care of self and others; 2) the rejection of preventive health practices, due to a distorted matrix of risk perception (and a certain sense of ""invulnerability""); 3) the domestic dynamics marked by postures of command, order, and honor. These dimensions of everyday life were profoundly upset in this first phase of the epidemic, in which confinement became the most recommended alternative. These issues are configured as recurring (though not recent) repertoires that glorify the central model of a male order that needs to become an object of reflection, insofar as they endanger the health of men and women and, more broadly, of the status quo of the accepted tenets of domestic and social order.","Medrado, Benedito; Lyra, Jorge; Nascimento, Marcos; Beiras, Adriano; Corrêa, Áurea Christina de Paula; Alvarenga, Eric Campos; Lima, Maria Lucia Chaves",Ciencia & saude coletiva,https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232020261.35122020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33533839/,60

DESIGN Scoping review. DATA SOURCES PEDro, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Library, Medline, ProQuest, PsycINFO, SportDISCUS and grey literature from inception to 10 April 2018. DATA SELECTION Using a modified Arksey and O'Malley framework, all English language studies in humans that met eligibility criteria using key search terms associated with sleep posture and spinal symptoms were included. DATA EXTRACTION Data were independently extracted by two reviewers and mapped to describe the current state of the literature. Articles meeting the search criteria were critically appraised using the Downs and Black checklist. RESULTS From 4186 articles, four articles were identified, of which three were epidemiological and one interventional. All studies examined three or more sleep postures, all measured sleep posture using self-report and one study also used infrared cameras. Two studies examined symptoms arising from the lumbar spine, one the cervical spine and one the whole spine. Waking pain and stiffness were the most common symptoms explored and side lying was generally protective against spinal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS This scoping review highlights the importance of evaluating sleep posture with respect to waking symptoms and has provided preliminary information regarding relationships between sleep posture and spinal symptoms. However, there were not enough high-quality studies to adequately answer our research question. It is recommended future research consider group sizes and population characteristics to achieve research goals, that a validated measure be used to assess sleep posture, that characteristics and location of spinal symptoms are clearly defined and that the side lying posture is subclassified.","Cary, Doug; Briffa, Kathy; McKenna, Leanda",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-027633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31256029/,60

Here, we found the deglycosylation and Maillard reaction with galactooligosaccharide (GOS) and fructooligosaccharide (FOS) can induce conformational transformation of OVM from other structures (β-turn, strang, and random coils) to α-helix. We also introduced an approach to reduce the allergenicity of Gallus domesticus OVM by Maillard reaction with GOS and FOS. However, the OVM glycated by mannosan (MOS) and deglycosylated OVM exhibited higher allergenicity than native OVM. Therefore, GOS and FOS, especially GOS, could be applied in the reduction of the potential allergenicity of OVM through glycation. Furthermore, these findings may provide new insights into the development of hypoallergenic egg products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, the allergenicity and conformation of OVM treated with deglycosylation and glycation (GOS, FOS, and MOS) were investigated. The results would provide a better understanding of the effects of deglycosylation and Maillard reaction with different reducing sugars on the molecular characteristics of OVM and further provide new insights into the development of hypoallergenic egg products.","Ma, Junjie; Zhou, Jinru; Chen, Lerong; Zhang, Hong; Wang, Yanbo; Fu, Linglin",Journal of food science,https://doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.15791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151424/,60

Temporary measures have made telemental health more readily available, including relaxing of regulations related to interstate licensure, controlled substance prescribing, patient privacy, and reimbursement. Though early efforts are underway to sustain these changes during and in the wake of the pandemic, there are important areas in which federal and institutional policy are still lacking. Additional steps are needed to successfully implement and sustain telemental health for college students include ensuring student access to technology and Internet; proactive outreach to optimize the student's home environment, addressing concerns about safety and confidentiality; developing the means to track rapidly shifting telemental health policy changes; and developing centralized resources that enable remote providers to become familiar with involuntary commitment laws and emergency protocols.","Huilgol, Yash S; Torous, John; Gold, Jessica A; Goldman, Matthew L",Journal of American college health : J of ACH,https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2021.1909040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33891526/,60

Although physiologic, environmental, and social factors influence the development of health conditions, routine decisions, such as food choice, also contribute substantially over time. Behavioral scientists believe that these routine decisions represent a key opportunity to improve population health. We conducted a scoping review of both health and business literature to identify themes in the food choices of young adults aged 19-24 y in the United States. Informed by the Joanna Briggs Institute processes for scoping reviews, we conducted a structured search of 8 health and business databases on 18 April 2017. The databases were PubMed, Business Source Complete, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and ABI/Inform Collection. Eligible literature captured real-world dietary choices of the general population of young adults between 1 January, 2007 and 31 December, 2017. Records were screened in Covidence. Data was extracted into Excel and key findings thematically analyzed. The search returned 9085 records. Ninety-nine records met the eligibility criteria. Themes identified in the foods chosen by young adults include inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption, choosing international flavors and food formats, convenience foods, frequent snacking, the selection of healthy foods based on perceptions of what is healthy rather than the nutrient or calorie content of foods, an interest in sustainable production methods, the desire to customize/tailor foods, foods young people find interesting, and regional foods. This research identified common food choices that can help inform the tailoring of health promotion efforts; however, more research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and principles shaping these choices.","Powell, Patricia K; Durham, Jo; Lawler, Sheleigh",Advances in nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmy116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31093651/,60

In these unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic, when guidance from public health epidemiologists and administrators is critical, it is incumbent on all of us to consider how we can use data to tell emotionally compelling stories aimed at improving public health. When informing the public about COVID-19 and other pressing public health issues, the author argues that we must begin with emotionally captivating stories, grounded in science. Supporting this approach is the work of psychologist Paul Slovic, who has shown that human beings are not only hard-wired to be story-driven, but that we are not, in general, moved by data. The challenge, then, is to tell emotionally captivating stories supported by data, especially in these divisive times.","Baer, Neal",Perspectives in biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1353/pbm.2020.0035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33416621/,60

Except for hyaluronan, they are sulfated to various extent, and covalently attached to proteins to form proteoglycans. GAGs interact with growth factors, morphogens, chemokines, extracellular matrix proteins and their bioactive fragments, receptors, lipoproteins, and pathogens. These interactions mediate their functions, from embryonic development to extracellular matrix assembly and regulation of cell signaling in various physiological and pathological contexts such as angiogenesis, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and infections. We give an overview of GAG-protein interactions (i.e., specificity and chemical features of GAG- and protein-binding sequences), and review the available GAG-protein interaction networks. We also provide the first comprehensive draft of the GAG interactome composed of 832 biomolecules (827 proteins and five GAGs) and 932 protein-GAG interactions. This network is a scaffold, which in the future should integrate structures of GAG-protein complexes, quantitative data of the abundance of GAGs in tissues to build tissue-specific interactomes, and GAG interactions with metal ions such as calcium, which plays a major role in the assembly of the extracellular matrix and its interactions with cells. This contextualized interactome will be useful to identify druggable GAG-protein interactions for therapeutic purpose.","Vallet, Sylvain D; Clerc, Olivier; Ricard-Blum, Sylvie",The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,https://doi.org/10.1369/0022155420946403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32757871/,60

METHODS A total of 36 fistulas were created by procedures that have been published previously. At fistula induction a skin biopsy was taken from which to culture fibroblasts. Four weeks after induction, when fistulas were well established, the fistula tracks were cored out. Collagen paste modified from Permacol injection (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) was then used as a solitary infill material in 11 tracks, cultured autologous fibroblasts being added to this in a further 18 tracks. The track was cored out in seven controls, but these tracks were not treated with infill material. All of the internal and external openings were closed. Anorectal excision was then carried out under terminal anesthesia at 2 to 12 weeks. Histologic examination of individual tracks was performed by an experienced pathologist. RESULTS In this quadruped all of the infilled tracks healed, autologous fibroblasts having the best tissue integration, but only two of seven control tracks healed. CONCLUSIONS Removal of the fistula track followed by injection of collagen healed all of the cases. The addition of autologous fibroblasts improved the histologic appearance of the tracks. A pilot study in human fistula patients is in progress.","Himpson, Rebecca C; Cohen, C Richard G; Sibbons, Paul; Phillips, Robin K S",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1007/dcr.0b013e31819ece3e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19404061/,60

OBJECTIVES To review and compare surgical outcomes for patients undergoing stand-alone anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) versus cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) for the treatment of cervical spine disease. METHODS A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Medline, and the Cochrane Library. Comparative trials measuring outcomes of patients undergoing CDA and stand-alone ACDF for degenerative spine disease in the last 10 years were selected for inclusion. After data extraction and quality assessment, statistical analysis was performed with R software metafor package. The random-effects model was used if there was heterogeneity between studies; otherwise, the fixed-effects model was used. RESULTS In total, 12 studies including 859 patients were selected for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Patients undergoing stand-alone ACDF had a statistically significant increase in postoperative segmental angles (mean difference 0.85° [95% confidence interval = 0.35° to 1.35°], P = .0008). Patients undergoing CDA had a decreased rate of developing adjacent segmental degeneration (risk ratio = 0.56 [95% confidence interval = -0.06 to 1.18], P = .0745). Neck Disability Index, Japanese Orthopedic Association score, Visual Analogue Scale of the arm and neck, as well as postoperative cervical angles were similar between the 2 treatments. CONCLUSIONS When compared with CDA, stand-alone ACDF offers similar clinical outcomes for patients and leads to increased postoperative segmental angles. We encourage further blinded randomized trials to compare rates of adjacent segmental degeneration and other postoperative outcomes between these 2 treatments options.","Gendreau, Julian L; Kim, Lily H; Prins, Payton N; D'Souza, Marissa; Rezaii, Paymon; Pendharkar, Arjun V; Sussman, Eric S; Ho, Allen L; Desai, Atman M",Global spine journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2192568219888448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32875831/,60

158825,Role of DC-SIGN in Lassa virus entry into human dendritic cells.,2013,"Paired associative stimulation (PAS) induces changes in the excitability of human sensorimotor cortex that outlast the procedure. PAS typically involves repeatedly pairing stimulation of a peripheral nerve that innervates an intrinsic hand muscle with transcranial magnetic stimulation over the representation of that muscle in the primary motor cortex. Depending on the timing of the stimuli (interstimulus interval of 25 or 10 ms), PAS leads to either an increase (PAS25) or a decrease (PAS10) in excitability. Both protocols, however, have been associated with an increase in excitability of nearby muscle representations not specifically targeted by PAS. Based on these spillover effects, we hypothesized that an additive, excitability-enhancing effect of PAS25 applied to one muscle representation may be produced by simultaneously applying PAS25 or PAS10 to a nearby representation. In different experiments prototypical PAS25 targeting the left thumb representation [abductor pollicis brevis (APB)] was combined with either PAS25 or PAS10 applied to the left little finger representation [abductor digiti minimi (ADM)] or, in a control experiment, with PAS10 also targeting the APB. In an additional control experiment PAS10 targeted both representations. The plasticity effects were quantified by measuring the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded before and after PAS. As expected, prototypical PAS25 was associated with an increase in MEP amplitude in the APB muscle. This effect was enhanced when PAS also targeted the ADM representation but only when a different interstimulus timing (PAS10) was used. These results suggest that PAS-induced plasticity is modified by concurrently targeting separate motor cortical representations with excitatory and inhibitory protocols.","Kamke, Marc R; Nydam, Abbey S; Sale, Martin V; Mattingley, Jason B",Journal of neurophysiology,https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00794.2015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26864761/,60

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between February 2009 and October 2017, 304 radical cystectomy cases were performed at a single institution (ORC, n = 54; robot-assisted radical cystectomy [RARC], n = 250). Data were prospectively collected. We identified 45 consecutive ORC cases performed without ERAS before the commencement of the RARC programme (Cohort A), 50 consecutive iRARC cases performed without ERAS (Cohort B) and 40 iRARC cases with ERAS (Cohort C). The primary outcome measure was LOS, while secondary outcome measures included peri-operative 90-day complications and readmission rate. Complications were accessed using the Clavien-Dindo system. RESULTS Patients in all cohorts were evenly matched with regard to age, sex, body mass index, neoadjuvant treatment, tumour stage, lymph node yield, previous pelvic radiotherapy and surgery, peri-operative anaemia, as well as physiological state. Patients who underwent iRARC with ERAS had a significantly higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score (III-IV) and were more likely to receive neobladder reconstruction. The median (interquartile range) LOS was shorter in the iRARC with ERAS group (7 [6-10]) days than in the iRARC without ERAS group (11 [8-15]) days and the ORC group (17 [14-21] days). In a propensity score-matched cohort of patients who underwent iRARC, patients who followed the ERAS pathway had significantly lower 90-day readmission rates. Additionally, implementing ERAS in an iRARC cohort resulted in a significantly lower 90-day all (P < 0.001) and gastrointestinal-related complications (P = 0.001). The ERAS pathway and younger patients were independently associated with an LOS of ≤10 days on multinomial logistic regression. CONCLUSION A comprehensive ERAS programme can significantly reduce LOS in patients undergoing iRARC without increasing 90-day readmission rates. An ERAS programme can augment the benefits of iRARC in improving peri-operative outcomes. In studies comparing ORC and RARC, the presence or absence of an ERAS programme will be a confounding factor and only level 1 evidence can be interpreted reliably.","Tan, Wei Shen; Tan, Mae-Yen; Lamb, Benjamin W; Sridhar, Ashwin; Mohammed, Anna; Baker, Hilary; Nathan, Senthil; Briggs, Timothy; Tan, Melanie; Kelly, John D",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.14073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29124853/,60

159603,Evaluation of an orthogonal pooling strategy for rapid high-throughput screening of proteases.,2008,"BACKGROUND Electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms vary widely among individuals, this decreases the usefulness of BIS™ monitors for assessing the effects of propofol. Practically, anesthesia is only seen as too deep when evidence of burst-suppression is seen. We designed an experiment to help towards better assessment of individual anesthetic needs. First, to mark the Ce (effect-site concentration) of propofol at loss of response to calling name and gently shaking shoulders (LOR), we defined Ce-LOR. To mark the transient power increase in the alpha range (9-14 Hz), common to all patients, when propofol concentration gradually increases, we defined Ce-alpha as the highest recorded alpha power for Ce. We also defined Ce-OBS as the Ce of propofol at initial observation of burst-suppression. Then we tried to predict Ce-LOR and Ce-alpha from Ce-OBS, vice versa, and considered the significance of these parameters. METHODS We enrolled 26 female patients (age 33-65) who were undergoing scheduled mastectomy. During anesthesia, we recorded all raw EEG packets as well as EEG-derived parameters on a computer from BIS-XP™ monitor. Propofol was infused using a TCI pump. Target concentration was adjusted so that Ce of propofol was gradually increased. RESULTS We obtained the following regression equation; Ce-alpha or Ce-OBS = Ce-LOR × 0.87 + 1.06 + dummy × 0.83 (for Ce-alpha dummy = 0, and for Ce-OBS = 1; adjusted r = 0.90, p < 2.2e-16) by ANCOVA. At Ce-alpha, BIS was 50.2 ± 7.7. CONCLUSION Ce-alpha and Ce-OBS could be estimated from Ce-LOR. Based on Ce-LOR it is possible to manage the hypnotic level of individual patients.","Kang, Hongling; Mohamed, Hassan Mamdouh Hassan; Takashina, Masaki; Mori, Takahiko; Fujino, Yuji; Hagihira, Satoshi",Journal of anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-017-2319-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28197775/,60

The virus affects not only the lungs but also other tissues, thus lending support to the idea that COVID-19 is a systemic disease. The current vaccine and treatment development strategies ought to consider such systems medicine perspectives rather than a narrower focus on the lung infection only. COVID-19 is associated with elevated levels of the inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). Elevated levels of cytokines and the cytokine storm have been linked to fatal disease. This suggests new therapeutic strategies through blocking the cytokine storm. IL-6 is one of the major cytokines associated with the cytokine storm. IL-6 is also known to display pleiotropic/diverse pathophysiological effects. We suggest the blockage of IL-6 signaling and its downstream mediators such as Janus kinases (JAKs), and signal transducer and activators of transcription (STATs) offer potential hope for the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19. Thus, repurposing of already approved IL-6-JAK-STAT signaling inhibitors as well as other anti-inflammatory drugs, including dexamethasone, is under development for severe COVID-19 cases. We conclude this expert review by highlighting the potential role of precision herbal medicines, for example, the Cannabis sativa, provided that omics technologies can be utilized to build a robust scientific evidence base on their clinical safety and efficacy. Precision herbal medicine buttressed by omics systems science would also help identify new molecular targets for drug discovery against COVID-19.","Dzobo, Kevin; Chiririwa, Harry; Dandara, Collet; Dzobo, Witness",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,https://doi.org/10.1089/omi.2020.0122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32857671/,60
161286,Varicella-zoster virus immediate-early protein ORF61 abrogates the IRF3-mediated innate immune response through degradation of activated IRF3.,2011,"IL-33 and ATP are alarmines which are released upon damage of cellular barriers or are actively secreted upon cell stress. Due to high density expression of the IL-33 receptor T1/ST2 (IL-33R), and the ATP receptor P2X7, mast cells (MCs) are one of the first highly sensitive sentinels recognizing released IL-33 or ATP in damaged peripheral tissues. Whereas IL-33 induces the MyD88-dependent activation of the TAK1-IKK2-NF-κB signaling, ATP induces the Ca2+ -dependent activation of NFAT. Thereby each signal alone only induces a moderate production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipid mediators (LMs). However, MCs which simultaneously sense (co-sensing) IL-33 and ATP display an enhanced and prolonged activation of the TAK1-IKK2-NF-κB signaling pathway. This resulted in a massive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and GM-CSF as well as of arachidonic acid-derived cyclooxygenase (COX)-mediated pro-inflammatory prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxanes (TXs), hallmarks of strong MC activation. Collectively, these data show that co-sensing of ATP and IL-33 results in hyperactivation of MCs which resembles to MC activation induced by IgE-mediated crosslinking of the FcεRI. Therefore, the IL-33/IL-33R and/ or the ATP/P2X7 signaling axis are attractive targets for therapeutical intervention of diseases associated to the loss of integrity of cellular barriers such as allergic and infectious respiratory reactions.","Jordan, Paul M; Andreas, Nico; Groth, Marco; Wegner, Philine; Weber, Franziska; Jäger, Ute; Küchler, Claudia; Werz, Oliver; Serfling, Edgar; Kamradt, Thomas; Dudeck, Anne; Drube, Sebastian",Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.13386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34142370/,60

METHODS AND TRIAL DESIGN The design was a prospective cohort study with a nested randomised, controlled intervention trial, using intra-operative BiSpectral index and cerebral oxygen saturation monitoring to enable optimisation of anaesthesia depth and cerebral oxygen saturation in older adults undergoing surgery. RESULTS In the 52 week prospective cohort study (192 surgical patients and 138 controls), mild (χ(2) = 17.9 p<0.0001), moderate (χ(2) = 7.8 p = 0.005) and severe (χ(2) = 5.1 p = 0.02) POCD were all significantly higher after 52 weeks in the surgical patients than among the age matched controls. In the nested RCT, 81 patients were randomized, 73 contributing to the data analysis (34 intervention, 39 control). In the intervention group mild POCD was significantly reduced at 1, 12 and 52 weeks (Fisher's Exact Test p = 0.018, χ(2) = 5.1 p = 0.02 and χ(2) = 5.9 p = 0.015), and moderate POCD was reduced at 1 and 52 weeks (χ(2) = 4.4 p = 0·037 and χ(2) = 5.4 p = 0.02).

164251,Rapid genotyping of tilapia lake virus (TiLV) using Nanopore sequencing,2021-05-28,"Collaborative learning (CL) has become a popular teaching and learning approach in higher education. The sudden transition from normal face-to-face (FTF) to online learning during the spread of COVID-19 has required consideration of one's digital competence to cope with online collaborative learning (OCL). This study investigates the perceptions of undergraduate engineering students and instructors -in a private university in Egypt- of using OCL tools, namely Google Suite or Quip to accomplish their assigned technical writing reports compared to other students who use the traditional FTF approach. The study adopts a quasi-experimental research design in which triangulation is applied for collecting data;the participants are 4 instructors and 133 students, divided into two disproportionate groups: 55 students represent the control group and 78 students represent the experimental treatment group which uses OCL to complete pretest and posttest report writing tasks. This paper focuses on stage one of the study. Two semi-structured questionnaires were distributed to students;the first indicated perceptions of students' digital competence before starting the treatment, while the second assessed their perceptions of CL using either method: FTF CL vs. OCL. Instructors were interviewed about their experience of monitoring student's progress through FTF CL or OCL. Results of the first questionnaire showed that most of students in both groups had adequate digital competence and would prefer FTF collaborative work to the online one. In the second questionnaire, results showed significant differences between FTF CL and OCL groups (p-value=0.01) in which the OCL group perceived 'Task completion and effectiveness of work' and 'Writing Skills' dimensions higher than the FTF group with mean differences (0.22) and (0.26), respectively. ANOVA test revealed significant differences between the 4 dimensions of CL in only the OCL (F(3, 308)=4.190, p=0.01) and Post HOC test showed that the 'writing skills' is the most highly perceived dimension in OCL compared to other ones. In stage two of the study which will be presented in a future research, statistical analysis will be conducted to compare significant differences between the pretest and posttest scores of students' collaborative report writing among FTF CL and OCL groups. © 2021 IEEE.","Morsi, W.

164504,Structural mapping of antibody landscapes to human betacoronavirus spike proteins,2021-10-01,"Lexical retrieval requires selecting and retrieving the most appropriate word from the lexicon to express a desired concept. Prior studies investigating the neuroanatomic underpinnings of lexical retrieval used lesion models that rely on stereotyped vascular distributions, functional neuroimaging methods that lack causal certainty, or awake brain mapping that is typically limited to narrow cortical exposures. Further, few studies have probed lexical retrieval with tasks other than picture naming and when non-picture naming lexical retrieval tasks have been applied, both convergent and divergent models emerged. Because of this existing controversy, we set out to test the hypothesis that cortical and subcortical brain regions specifically involved in lexical retrieval in response to visual and auditory stimuli represent overlapping neural systems. Fifty-three patients with dysnomic aphasia due to dominant-hemisphere brain tumors performed four language tasks: picture naming, auditory naming, text reading, and describing line drawings with correct syntax. A subset of participants also underwent the Quick Aphasia Battery which provides a validated measure of lexical retrieval via the word finding subtest. Generalized linear modeling and principal components analysis revealed multicollinearity between picture naming, auditory naming, and word finding, implying redundancies between the linguistic measures. Support vector regression lesion-symptom mapping across participants was used to model accuracies on each of the four language tasks. Picture naming and auditory naming survived cluster-level corrections. Specifically, lesions within overlapping clusters of 8,333 voxels and 21,512 voxels in the left lateral PFC were predictive of impaired picture naming and auditory naming, respectively. These data indicate a convergence of heteromodal lexical retrieval within the PFC. Importance of the Study Lexical retrieval (i.e., selecting and retrieving words to convey desired concepts) is a crucial component of language processing. However, existing studies of the neuroanatomic underpinnings of lexical retrieval lack causal relationships and have provided conflicting evidence, suggesting both convergent and divergent models. In order to resolve these conflicting models, we used lesion-symptom mapping to investigate lexical retrieval in 53 patients with dominant-hemisphere brain tumors. We observed significant associations between performance on visual and auditory naming tasks. Further, performance on these tasks predicted performance on a validated neuropsychological measure of lexical retrieval. Critically, multivariate, nonparametric lesion-symptom mapping within a brain tumor framework revealed that lesions in overlapping regions of the left lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) predict impaired visual and auditory naming. In a clinical context, this approach to identifying causal brain-behavior relationships could help to guide brain tumor therapies such as cytoreductive surgery and supportive rehabilitation services.","Aabedi, Alexander A.; Kakaizada, Sofia; Young, Jacob S.; Wiese, Olivia; Valdivia, Claudia; Berger, Mitchel S.; Weissman, Daniel H.; Brang, David; Hervey-Jumper, Shawn L.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.30.405746,60

Successful social restrictions are believed as a powerful way in controlling COVID-19 spread. This paper evaluated the social restriction that has been implemented in Indonesia and its connection to the spread of COVID-19 in the period 15 February 2020 to 10 January 2021. The social restriction is quantified by the changes in human movement, while the spread of COVID-19 is computed by a growth rate and doubling time of the COVID-19 cases. A statistic measure by linear regression is applied to investigate the dependency of the COVID-19 spread and human movement. This paper showed the social restriction reduced human mobility up to more than 50% when the restriction was started. It flattened the cases but it only lasted for approximately two months. Afterward, the growth rate and the doubling time showed an increase of the COVID-19 cases and it was getting much worse starting at the end of the year 2020. Moreover, we found that the implemented social restriction in Indonesia is less effective to reduce the COVID-19 spread in Indonesia as human mobility during a holiday, an especially long weekend is much stronger. © 2021 IEEE.","Syafarina, I.; Shabrina, A.; Latifah, A.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service (CMS) Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Bundle (SEP-1) is an evidence-based early management bundle focused on improving sepsis outcomes. It is unknown which quality improvement (QI) practices are associated with SEP-1 compliance and if those practices reduce sepsis mortality. The objectives of this study were to compare sepsis QI practices in SEP-1 reporting and non-reporting hospitals and to measure the association between specific elements of sepsis QI processes and SEP-1 performance and hospital-specific risk-adjusted sepsis mortality. Design, Setting, and Patients: This mixed methods study linked telephone survey data on QI practices from Iowa hospitals to SEP-1 performance data and risk-adjusted mortality from statewide all-payer administrative claims database. The survey assessed sepsis QI practices in eight categories. Characteristics of hospitals and sepsis QI practices were compared by SEP-1 reporting status. Univariable and multivariable logistic and linear regression estimated the association of QI practices with hospital SEP-1 performance and observed-to-expected sepsis mortality ratios. Interventions: None Measurements and Main Results: All 118 Iowa hospitals completed the survey (100% response rate). SEP-1 reporting hospitals were more likely to have sepsis QI practices, including reporting sepsis quality to providers (64% vs. 38%, p = 0.026) and using the case review process to develop sepsis care plans (87% vs. 64%, p = 0.013). Sepsis QI practices were not associated with increased SEP-1 scores. Two were associated with reduced mortality: having a sepsis committee B= -0.11, p = 0.036) and using case review results for sepsis care plans (B= -0.10, p = 0.049). Conclusions: Hospitals reporting SEP-1 compliance to CMS conduct more sepsis QI practices. Most QI practices are not associated with increased SEP-1 performance or decreased sepsis mortality. Future work could explore how to implement these performance improvement practices in hospitals not reporting SEP-1 compliance.","Bolte, T. B.; Swanson, M. B.; Kaldjian, A.; Mohr, N.

The aim of this study was to identify and compare the purchasing behaviors of furniture consumers in the period before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two surveys were conducted in Croatia, the first in April and May 2020 with the assumption that consumer purchasing behaviors will change during the COVID-19 pandemic in the following year and the second one during March 2021. Differences regarding consumer purchasing behaviors and preferences for wood furniture between respondents regarding demographic and economic factors before and during the pandemic were found. The coronavirus pandemic is teaching us all hard lessons about resilience and adaptability, and new opportunities and solutions are essential. Nowadays, it is becoming increasingly important to produce information. Research offers insights into future design and building communication to better meet the information needs of different types of consumers and to more broadly increase the acceptance and appeal of wood furniture in society in the spirit of sustainable and bio-based circular economy.","Pirc Barčić, Andreja Kitek Kuzman Manja Vergot Tihana Grošelj Petra",Forests,https://doi.org/10.3390/f12070873,60
169996,Cell entry inhibitor with sulfonated colloid gold as new potent broad-spectrum virucides,2021-06-12,"Abstract In conventional metal cutting, different tool wear modes, and their individual deterioration rates play vital roles in overall production performance. For a given tool (i.e., geometry or materials), many shop floors still follow a standard rule by pre-setting a tool life, which is conservative but not realistic. Premature failure of a tool can cause unexpected machine downtime and material losses, while another tool could serve beyond that pre-set life. As a result, optimized tool life and productivity cannot be achieved. Moreover, nowadays, there is an increased demand of process monitoring and optimization on the unmanned and the semi-automated shop floors. Tool condition monitoring (TCM) systems for process improvement and optimization have been in research for several decades. Both offline and online TCM systems are invented and discussed. A wide range of original publications are reported focusing on different sub-topics, e.g., specific machining process-based TCM methods, measurement or signal acquisition methods, processing methods, and classifiers. With the recent evolution of smart sensors in the era of Industry 4.0, development of online TCM systems received much attention to the researchers. Accordingly, research on some sub-topics also gets motivated into different directions, such as, feasibility of power or current sensors, machine vision technique, and combination of multi-sensors. Thus, from the industrial viewpoint, the current state of implementation of the proposed TCM systems for (near) real-time process monitoring and control needs to be clear. This paper presents the state-of-the-art of the TCM systems covering three major machining operations, discusses their application feasibility in industry environments, and states some current TCMS implementations. Challenges being faced by the industry are concluded, along with direction and suggestions for future researches.","Nath, Chandra",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315754; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315754,60

This brought into stark relief the fact that urban economic activity is no longer attached to specific workplaces. This detachment has been analysed in research on organisations and workers, but has not yet been incorporated into concepts used to document and plan the economic geography of cities. In this article, three questions are explored by way of an original survey: first, how can a shift in the location of economic activity be measured at the urban scale whilst incorporating the idea that work is not attached to a single location? Second, what is the nature of the shift that occurred in March 2020? Third, what does this tell us about concepts that have underpinned the study of urban economic form by geographers and planners? Applying concepts developed in organisation studies and sociology, we operationalise the idea that economic activity happens across multiple spaces: it occurs within a probability space, and since March 2020 it has shifted within this space. To better understand and interpret the longer-term impact of this shift on cities ? downtowns in particular ? we draw upon interviews with people working from home.","Shearmur, Richard Ananian Priscilla Lachapelle Ugo Parra-Lokhorst Manuela Paulhiac Florence Tremblay Diane-Gabrielle Wycliffe-Jones Alastair",Urban Studies,https://doi.org/10.1177/00420980211022895,60

While checkpoint inhibitor therapy has been effective for reactivating tumour immunity in some cancers, many solid cancers, including breast cancer, remain largely non-responsive. Understanding the way non-responsive cancers evolve to evade immunity, what resistance pathways are activated and whether this occurs at the clonal level will improve immunotherapeutic design. We tracked cancer cell clones during the immunoediting process and determined clonal transcriptional profiles that allow immune evasion in murine mammary tumour growth in response to immunotherapy with anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4. Clonal diversity was significantly restricted by immunotherapy treatment at both the primary and metastatic sites. These findings demonstrate that immunoediting selects for pre-existing breast cancer cell populations, that immunoediting is not a static process and is ongoing during metastasis and immunotherapy treatment. Isolation of immunotherapy resistant clones revealed unique and overlapping transcriptional signatures. The overlapping gene signature was predictive of poor survival in basal-like breast cancer patient cohorts. Some of these overlapping genes have existing small molecules which can be used to potentially improve immunotherapy response.","Baldwin, Louise A.; Bartonicek, Nenad; Yang, Jessica; Wu, Sunny Z.; Deng, Niantao; Roden, Daniel L.; Chan, Chia-Ling; Al-Eryani, Ghamdan; Swarbrick, Alexander; Junankar, Simon",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.11.426174,60

Because of the close closeness to the patient during dental care, the significant production of aerosols, and the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva, the oral cavity has been identified as a potential reservoir for COVID-19 transmission. Mouthwashes are popular because they help to reduce the amount of bacteria in the mouth. Despite the lack of clinical evidence, to minimize the amount of microorganisms in aerosols and drops during oral procedures, antimicrobial mouth rinses with chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, povidone-iodine, Listerine, and hydrogen peroxide have been prescribed before surgery.

173584,"Suppression of influenza virus infection by rhinovirus interference at the population, individual and cellular levels",2021-08-10,"Lyme disease, the most common tick-borne illness in the United States, is most frequently caused by infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. Although early antibiotic treatment can prevent development of severe illness and late manifestations, diagnosis is challenging in patients who do not present with a typical erythema migrans rash. To support a diagnosis of Lyme disease in such cases, guidelines recommend 2-tiered serologic testing. However, 2-tiered testing has numerous limitations, including ambiguity in interpretation and lower sensitivity in early disease. We developed a diagnostic approach for Lyme disease based on the T-cell response to B. burgdorferi infection by immunosequencing T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires in blood samples from 3 independent cohorts of patients with laboratory-confirmed or clinically diagnosed early Lyme disease, as well as endemic and non-endemic controls. We identified 251 public, Lyme-associated TCRs that were used to train a classifier for detection of early Lyme disease with 99% specificity. In a validation cohort of individuals with early Lyme disease, TCR testing demonstrated a 1.9-fold increase in sensitivity compared to standard 2-tiered testing (STTT; 56% versus 30%), with a 3.1-fold increase <=4 days from the onset of symptoms (44% versus 14%). TCR positivity predicted subsequent seroconversion in 37% of initially STTT-negative patients, suggesting that the T-cell response is detectable before the humoral response. While positivity for both tests declined after treatment, greater declines in posttreatment sensitivity were observed for STTT compared to TCR testing. Higher TCR scores were associated with clinical measures of disease severity, including abnormal liver function test results, disseminated rash, and number of symptoms. A subset of Lyme-associated TCRs mapped to B. burgdorferi antigens, demonstrating high specificity of a TCR immunosequencing approach. These results support the clinical utility of T-cell-based testing as a sensitive and specific diagnostic for early Lyme disease, particularly in the initial days of illness.","Greissl, J.; Pesesky, M.; Dalai, S.

Delta variant is less sensitive to serum neutralization from COVID-19 convalescent individuals or vaccine recipients, relative to Alpha strains. It was also resistant to neutralization by some anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) and anti-N-terminal domain (NTD) antibodies in clinics. Previously, we reported the discovery of nanobodies isolated from an alpaca immunized with spike protein, exhibiting ultrahigh potency against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutated variants, where a novel inhalable bispecific Nb15 protected SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2 mice. Here, we found that Nb22-Fc, among our previously reported nanobodies, exhibited 8.4-fold increased neutralization potency against Delta variant with an IC50 value of 0.41 ng/ml (5.13 pM) relative to Alpha variant. Furthermore, our crystal structural analysis reveals that the binding of Nb22 on SARS-CoV-2 RBD effectively blocks the binding of RBD to ACE2 during virus infection. Furthermore, the L452R mutation in RBD of Delta variant forms an additional hydrogen bond with the hydroxy group of T30 of Nb22, leading to the increased neutralization potency of Nb22 against Delta variant. Thus, Nb22 is a potential therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2, especially the highly contagious Delta variant.","Wu, Xilin; Wang, Yaxing; Cheng, Lin; Zhu, Linjing; Ma, Sen; Huang, Bilian; Xu, Shijie; Shi, Haixia; Zhang, Doudou; Liu, Linshuo; Nawaz, Waqas; Ye, Sheng; Wu, Zhiwei",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.06.459055,60

This paper aims to examine the suitability of analytical hierarchy process (AHP)-based tools for initial screening of manufacturing reshoring decisions.Design/methodology/approachTwo AHP-based tools for the initial screening of manufacturing reshoring decisions are developed. The first tool is based on traditional AHP, while the second is based on fuzzy-AHP. Six high-level and holistic reshoring criteria based on competitive priorities were identified through a literature review. Next, a panel of experts from a Swedish manufacturing company was involved in the overall comparison of the criteria. Based on this comparison, priority weights of the criteria were obtained through a pairwise analysis. Subsequently, the priority weights were used in a weighted-sum manner to evaluate 20 reshoring scenarios. Afterwards, the outputs from the traditional AHP and fuzzy-AHP tools were compared to the opinions of the experts. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the stability of the developed decision support tools.FindingsThe research demonstrates that AHP-based support tools are suitable for the initial screening of manufacturing reshoring decisions. With regard to the presented set of criteria and reshoring scenarios, both traditional AHP and fuzzy-AHP are shown to be consistent with the experts' decisions. Moreover, fuzzy-AHP is shown to be marginally more reliable than traditional AHP. According to the sensitivity analysis, the order of importance of the six criteria is stable for high values of weights of cost and quality criteria.Research limitations/implicationsThe limitation of the developed AHP-based tools is that they currently only include a limited number of high-level decision criteria. Therefore, future research should focus on adding low-level criteria to the tools using a multi-level architecture. The current research contributes to the body of literature on the manufacturing reshoring decision-making process by addressing decision-making issues in general and by demonstrating the suitability of two decision support tools applied to the manufacturing reshoring field in particular.Practical implicationsThis research provides practitioners with two decision support tools for the initial screening of manufacturing reshoring decisions, which will help managers optimize their time and resources on the most promising reshoring alternatives. Given the complex nature of reshoring decisions, the results from the fuzzy-AHP are shown to be slightly closer to those of the experts than traditional AHP for initial screening of manufacturing relocation decisions.Originality/valueThis paper describes two decision support tools that can be applied for the initial screening of manufacturing reshoring decisions while considering six high-level and holistic criteria. Both support tools are applied to evaluate 20 identical manufacturing reshoring scenarios, allowing a comparison of their output. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates the relative importance of the reshoring criteria.","Sequeira, Movin Hilletofth Per Adlemo Anders",Journal of Global Operations and Strategic Sourcing,https://doi.org/10.1108/jgoss-07-2020-0037,60

It seeks to identify the format and content of images used to illustrate online information about the pandemic, in particular, from websites of policy institutions, research promoters, and media in Portugal and Spain. By examining a sample containing 600 images, it aims to identify the messages being conveyed and the effects these images intend to provoke and to illuminate the differences in representations among the three sources of communication. Differences and similarities with visual images of previous pandemics (influenza, AIDS) are examined. This article ascertains that policy websites aim to be mostly prescriptive, relying on infographics to convey prevention and care instructions to its audiences. On the other hand, science websites rely mostly on stock photos and images from scientific articles to illustrate current research, while newspaper websites are the most diversified in terms of the images they use and the topics they cover. This study concludes that representations of science are still very much based on stereotypical imagery of labs and white coats, that representations of the medical side of the pandemic are focused on images of intensive care that aim to generate fear and stimulate responsible behavior, and that the social aspects of the pandemic are illustrated by images that focus either on pandemic prevention (e.g., washing hands) or on the impacts of the pandemic itself (e.g., empty streets during lockdown).","Delicado, A.; Rowland, J.",Frontiers in Communication,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomm.2021.645725,60

The purpose of this study was to determine how SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts histone levels, fibrin structure, and endogenous thrombin potential in the presence and absence of endothelial cells. Approach We studied individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome at the time of initiation of mechanical ventilation compared to healthy controls. Blood samples were assayed for levels of histone-DNA complexes. Confocal microscopy was used to evaluate fibrin structure in clots formed from recalcified plasma samples using fluorescently-labeled fibrinogen. Endogenous thrombin potential was measured by calibrated automated thrombin assays in the presence of tissue factor and phospholipid (PCPS) or cultured human endothelial cells. Results Circulating nucleosomes were elevated in the plasma of COVID-19 patients relative to healthy controls (n=6, each group). COVID-19 patient plasma thrombin generation was also altered. Despite having an increased endogenous thrombin potential, patient plasma samples exhibited prolonged lag times and times to peak thrombin in the presence of added tissue factor and PCPS. Strikingly different results were observed when endothelial cells were used in place of tissue factor and PCPS. Control plasma samples did not generate measurable thrombin (lag time >60 min); in contrast, plasma samples from COVID-19+ patients generated thrombin (mean lag time ∼20 min). Consistent with the observed alterations in thrombin generation, clots from COVID-19 subjects exhibited a denser fibrin network, thinner fibers and lower fibrin resolvability. Conclusions Elevated histones, aberrant fibrin formation, and increased endothelial-dependent thrombin generation in COVID-19 may contribute to coagulopathy. HIGHLIGHTS Histone-DNA complexes are significantly elevated in the plasma of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Measures of thrombin generation by calibrated automated thrombography and fibrin clots formed in situ are altered in severe COVID-19. Plasma from COVID-19 patients promotes thrombin generation on cultured endothelial cells in the absence of added tissue factor or phospholipids. The additive effects of histones on thrombin generation and endothelial cell function may play a major role in the thrombotic complications observed in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Bouchard, Beth A.; Colovos, Christos; Lawson, Michael; Osborn, Zachary; Sackheim, Adrian; Mould, Kara J.; Janssen, William J.; Cohen, Mitchell J.; Majumdar, Devdoot; Freeman, Kalev",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.03.450992,60

Occurring at the land–sea interface, estuarine habitats such as mangroves are at risk of plastic pollution. This study compared MP pollution (level, morphotype, polymer composition, size and colour) across four South African estuaries, in relation to the built and natural environment. Mouth status, surrounding human population densities and land-use practices influenced the level and type of MP pollution. Systems that were most at risk were predominantly open estuaries surrounded by high population densities and diverse land use types. Microplastic levels and the diversity of types detected increased with increasing levels of anthropogenic disturbance. Overall, microfibres dominated in estuarine water (69%) and mangrove sediment (51%). Polyethylene (43%) and polypropylene (23%) were the dominant polymers overall. Weathered fishing gear, weathered packaging items and run-off from urban/industrial centres are probable sources of MP pollution. Increased run-off and river input during the wet/rainy season may explain the markedly higher MP loads in estuarine waters relative to the dry season. By contrast, MP deposition in mangrove sediment was higher during the dry season. Sediment MP abundance was significantly positively correlated with both pneumatophore density and sediment size (500–2000 µm). This study highlights the role of mangroves as MP sinks, which may limit movement of MPs into adjacent environments. However, under conditions such as flooding and extreme wave action, mangroves may shift from sinks to sources of plastic pollution.","Govender, Joelene Naidoo Trishan Rajkaran Anusha Cebekhulu Senzo Bhugeloo Astika Sershen",Water,https://doi.org/10.3390/w12102802,60

178812,Small interfering RNAs are highly effective inhibitors regarding Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus replication in vitro,2020-05-14,"This research examines supply chain collaboration effects on organizational performance in global value chain (GVC) infrastructure by focusing on GVC disaggregation, market turbulence, inequality, market globalization, product diversity, exploitation, and technological breakthroughs. The research strives to develop a better understanding of global value chains through relational view, behavioral, and contingency theories along with institutional and stakeholder theories of supply chains. Based on conflicting insights from these theories, this research investigates how relationships and operational outcomes of collaboration fare when market turbulence is present. Data is obtained and analyzed from focal firms that are engaged in doing business in emerging markets (e.g., India), and headquartered in the United States. We investigate relational outcomes (e.g., trust, credibility, mutual respect, and relationship commitment) among supply chain partners, and found that these relational outcomes result in better operational outcomes (e.g., profitability, market share increase, revenue generation, etc.). From managerial standpoint, supply chain managers should focus on relational outcomes that can strengthen operational outcomes in GVCs resulting in stronger organizational performance. The research offers valuable insights for theory and practice of global value chains by focusing on the GVC disaggregation through the measurement of market turbulence, playing a key role in the success of collaborative buyer–supplier relationships (with a focus on US companies doing business in India) leading to an overall improved firm performance.","Arora, Amit Arora Anshu Anyu Julius McIntyre John R.",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13084151,60

For this purpose, a quantitative study with descriptive scope was carried out, based on statistical data from the Federation of Colombian Insurers - FASECOLDA, obtained from the different Occupational Risks Administrators. According to the above, a decrease in the number of companies affiliated to the General System of Occupational Risks was observed in November 2019, where a total of 882.283 affiliated companies were registered, while for this same month in 2020, only 826.950 were evidenced. In the same way, this brought with it a decrease in the number of affiliated workers, from 11.032.433 to 10.408.531 workers in the same period, representing a decrease of 6%. On the other hand, it was established that qualified as work-related illnesses increased exponentially from 8.202 illnesses in the year 2019 to a total of 49.788 in 2020, where the most representative increase was evidenced in the Health and Social Services Sector, which increased from 481 cases per year to 34.750, a value corresponding to 70% of the total diseases classified as work-related in 2020. In second place, the Real Estate Sector stands out, which presented an increase from 979 to 5.288 diseases, followed by the Transport, Storage and Communications sector with an increase from 381 to 1.489 cases. Regarding qualified as work related accidents in 2019 and 2020, a decrease of 172.139 cases was established, representing a variation of 28% less. In the same way, the mortality generated by work accidents ranged from 488 to 375, consolidating a 23% of decrease in deaths compared to the previous year, a situation that differs from deaths caused by occupational diseases, which increased from 4 to 76 cases. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Gutiérrez Bernal, L.

179648,DisCVR: Rapid viral diagnosis from high-throughput sequencing data,2019-01-23,"Purpose: Access to in-person diabetes self-management education (DSME) programs is limited in underserved immigrant communities. In this report, we examined the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of a social media-based DSME intervention in low-income older Chinese immigrants with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods: This was a single-group study in 30 Chinese immigrants with T2D living in NYC. The intervention included 24 culturally and linguistically tailored DSME videos. Over 12 weeks, participants received 2 brief videos each week via WeChat, a free social media app popular among Chinese immigrants. Feasibility was defined as ability to achieve: 1) the recruitment goal (n=30);2) >80% retention;and 3) >80% watch rate. Acceptability was assessed via a satisfaction survey at 6 months. HbA1c was collected at baseline and 6 months Results: Recruitment was completed prior to the NYC COVID-19 lockdown. Despite COVID-19, the intervention continued without interruption. Participants were mostly female (70.0%), married (63.3%), with limited English proficiency (86.7%), and a mean age of 61.2 (SD=6.7) years old. Most reported an annual household income of < $25,000 (84.0%) and an education of high school or less (63.3%). Thirty participants were recruited within 2 months, 93.3% were retained at 6 months, and a video watch rate of 92.2% was achieved. The mean baseline HbA1c was 7.4% (SD=1.2) and declined by 0.6% (95% CI: 0.3%-0.9%, p=0.001) to 6.8% (SD=0.8) at 6 months. Participants expressed high satisfaction (96.4%), and all strongly agreed or agreed that they preferred this video-based DSME to face-to-face visits. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated that a social media-based DSME intervention is feasible, acceptable, and potentially efficacious in an aging low-income immigrant population with T2D. These findings provide timely implications in the era of COVID-19, suggesting older low-income immigrants can be engaged in mHealth interventions.","Hu, Lu Islam Nadia Kharmats Anna Y.; Tamura, Kosuke Yang Shuwen Xu Xinyi Fan Baolun Sevick Mary Ann",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-1-or,60
180041,Collective cell sorting requires contractile cortical waves in germline cells,2020-01-06,"Mucormycosis, a deadly fungal infection, has affected thousands of COVID-19 patients in India. Mucormycosis, formerly known as zygomycosis, is caused by the many fungi that belong to the family ""Mucorales."" These molds are commonly found in soil, air, and damp walls and frequently colonize oral mucosa, nose, paranasal sinuses, and throat. The pathophysiological consequences of diabetes combined with the acute inflammatory surge in COVID-19 and steroid treatment weakens person's immunity and renders susceptibility to fungal infections. Patients treated for severe COVID-19 have damaged lungs and suppressed immune system, an environment that supports fungal infection. Fungal spores can grow in airways or sinuses, and invade bodies' tissues, explaining why the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses are the most common site of mucormycosis infection, the consequential spread to the eyes can cause blindness, or causing headaches or seizures if the infection spreads to the brain. Poorly controlled diabetes often results in acidosis in tissues a suitable environment for Mucorales fungi to grow, exacerbating the risk for mucormycosis. This becomes clinically important, especially in India that has an increased prevalence of undiagnosed and uncontrolled diabetes. Given that a significant increase in the cases of mucormycosis in the diabetic patients treated for COVID-19 is strongly associated with corticosteroid administration, there is a need to evaluate use of dietary nutraceuticals with immune boosting potentials that modulate metabolic abnormalities in the management of COVID-19 associated mucormycosis.","Agnihotri, A.

Both clinical and research uses of such data require co-analysis with large datasets, for which participant privacy and the need for data custodian controls must remain paramount. This is particularly challenging in multi-jurisdictional settings, such as Canada, where health privacy and security requirements are often heterogeneous. Data federation presents a solution to this, allowing for integration and analysis of large datasets from various sites while abiding by local policies. The Canadian Distributed Infrastructure for Genomics platform (CanDIG) enables federated querying and analysis of -omics and health data while keeping that data local and under local control. It builds upon existing infrastructures to connect five health and research institutions across Canada, relies heavily on standards and tooling brought together by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), implements a clear division of responsibilities among its participants and adheres to international data sharing standards. Participating researchers and clinicians can therefore contribute to and quickly access a critical mass of -omics data across a national network in a manner that takes into account the multi-jurisdictional nature of our privacy and security policies. Through this, CanDIG gives medical and research communities the tools needed to use and analyze the ever-growing amount of -omics data available to them in order to improve our understanding and treatment of various conditions and diseases. CanDIG is being used to make genomic and phenotypic data available for querying across Canada as part of data sharing for five leading pan-Canadian projects including the Terry Fox Comprehensive Cancer Care Centre Consortium Network (TF4CN) and Terry Fox PRecision Oncology For Young peopLE (PROFYLE), and making data from provincial projects such as POG (Personalized Onco- Genomics) more widely available.","Dursi, L.

However, our understanding of transcriptional and repertoire changes following full vaccination remains incomplete. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and functional assays to compare humoral and cellular responses to two doses of mRNA vaccine with responses observed in convalescent individuals with asymptomatic disease. Our analyses revealed enrichment of spike-specific B cells, activated CD4 T cells, and robust antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4 T cell responses in all vaccinees. On the other hand, CD8 T cell responses were both weak and variable. Interestingly, clonally expanded CD8 T cells were observed in every vaccinee, as observed following natural infection. TCR gene usage, however, was variable, reflecting the diversity of repertoires and MHC polymorphism in the human population. Natural infection induced expansion of larger CD8 T cell clones occupied distinct clusters, likely due to the recognition of a broader set of viral epitopes presented by the virus not seen in the mRNA vaccine. Our study highlights a coordinated adaptive immune response where early CD4 T cell responses facilitate the development of the B cell response and substantial expansion of effector CD8 T cells, together capable of contributing to future recall responses.","Sureshchandra, Suhas; Lewis, Sloan A.; Doratt, Brianna; Jankeel, Allen; Ibraim, Izabela; Messaoudi, Ilhem",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.14.452381,60

Amid this uncertainty, some philanthropic strategies have struggled to find their footing while others have adapted easily, harnessing previously unanticipated opportunities to achieve change. Why have some philanthropic strategies been more successful than others? What wisdom can we draw from this moment that can help us prepare for the future? • During times of crisis, the concept of resilience is frequently applied to nonprofit organizations and their leaders. This article flips the vantage point toward funders, proposing a theory to explain what makes some philanthropic strategies more durable than others in the face of disruptions. Drawing on case examples across diverse settings, literature on resilience, and the authors' own observations, it proposes five elements of resilient philanthropic strategies: They release control over pathways and outcomes;support networks rather than solutions;address systems, not symptoms;focus on transformative over transactional capacity;and align philanthropic power to supplement, not supplant. • Recognizing that COVID-19 is only one of many disruptions our world is likely to face, this article seeks to offer a new way of thinking about strategy resilience that centers people and organizations instead of the power of financial resources. At the core of this theory is the assumption that given today's complexities, philanthropy must use its power differently — releasing control over organizations and their change strategies while using its unique position, reach, and voice to work in solidarity with community leaders. © 2021.

The investigation of these dynamics can provide a better understanding of diffusing objects and their surrounding media, but a quantitative characterization from individual trajectories is often challenging. Efforts devoted to improving anomalous diffusion detection using classical statistics and machine learning have produced several new methods. Recently, the anomalous diffusion challenge (AnDi, https://www.andi-challenge.org) was launched to objectively assess these approaches on a common dataset, focusing on three aspects of anomalous diffusion: the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent; the classification of the diffusion model; and the segmentation of trajectories. In this article, I describe a simple approach to tackle the tasks of the AnDi challenge by combining extreme learning machine and feature engineering (AnDi-ELM).

The present work shows that it is possible to extract lung X-ray characteristics to improve the methods of examining and diagnosing patients with suspected COVID-19, distinguishing them from malaria, dengue, H1N1, tuberculosis, and Streptococcus pneumonia. More precisely, an intelligent computational model was developed to process lung X-ray images and classify whether the image is of a patient with COVID-19. The images were processed and extracted their characteristics. These characteristics were the input data for an unsupervised statistical learning method, PCA, and clustering, which identified specific attributes of X-ray images with Covid-19. The introduction of statistical models allowed a fast algorithm, which used the X-means clustering method associated with the Bayesian Information Criterion (CIB). The developed algorithm efficiently distinguished each pulmonary pathology from X-ray images. The method exhibited excellent sensitivity.

Detection by RT-PCR as the gold standard of WHO is still difficult to reach in some areas and has a low sensitivity issue. Many studies have focused on the detection of Covid-19 using computer vision, especially deep learning methods. However, it is necessary to evaluate the preprocessing stage before carrying out the classification to increase the accuracy of its detection. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the choice of the CT-Scan image pre-processing method and its effect on the results of covid-19 classification accuracy. The benefit of this study is that it can be used as a recommendation when considering the choice of a CT-Scan image preprocessing method to improve the accuracy of Covid-19 detection through more comprehensive deep learning. This study uses a CT scan image because it is considered to be of better quality than an X-ray image, although the price is relatively more expensive. The various methods used were resizing (deformed and non-deformed), enhancement(HE, CLAHE, EFF), and normalization ranges ([-1 1] and [0 1]). Meanwhile, the deep learning method used is the VGG-16 classifier. The results showed that there was an influence generated by the variations in the preprocessing methods on the precision of the Covid-19 classification. The highest accuracy results were obtained with 88.54% using the deformation ranges of size change, CLAHE improvement and normalization [0 1] and [-1 1].

METHODS A representative sample of women recruited through a commercial social research sampling organisation completed a detailed online questionnaire about menstruation. Specific detailed questions were asked about perceptions of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) and menstrual pain. RESULTS The questionnaire was completed by 1575 women aged 20-39 years. Most perceived their bleeding to be light (11.6%) or moderate (60.5%); 363 (22.5%) perceived it to be heavy and 86 (5.3%) very heavy. Women who experienced severe or very severe menstrual pain were significantly more likely to report periods as heavy or very heavy (p < .001). The prevalence ratios for being confined to bed during menstruation for women experiencing severe or very severe menstrual pain were 12.02 (95% CI: 5.71-25.31) and 15.93 (95% CI: 7.51-33.78), respectively, compared with women experiencing no pain. The prevalence ratios for being confined to bed were 1.58 (95% CI: 1.11-2.24) and 1.53 (95% CI: 1.04-2.25) for women with heavy or very heavy bleeding, respectively. Women who experienced severe or very severe menstrual pain associated with their HMB were >12 times more likely to be confined to bed for 0.5-1 day during menstruation than if they reported HMB without pain. CONCLUSION Severe menstrual pain with HMB has a much more profound effect on all aspects of women's QoL than HMB alone; it accounts for more days in bed and for loss of productivity.","Weisberg, Edith; McGeehan, Kevin; Fraser, Ian S",The European journal of contraception & reproductive health care : the official journal of the European Society of Contraception,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27623183/,60

The outbreak was centered in the Gulu district of northern Uganda, with secondary transmission to other districts. After the initial diagnosis of Sudan ebolavirus by the National Institute for Virology in Johannesburg, South Africa, a temporary diagnostic laboratory was established within the Gulu district at St. Mary's Lacor Hospital. The laboratory used antigen capture and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to diagnose Sudan ebolavirus infection in suspect patients. The RT-PCR and antigen-capture diagnostic assays proved very effective for detecting ebolavirus in patient serum, plasma, and whole blood. In samples collected very early in the course of infection, the RT-PCR assay could detect ebolavirus 24 to 48 h prior to detection by antigen capture. More than 1,000 blood samples were collected, with multiple samples obtained from many patients throughout the course of infection. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine the viral load in multiple samples from patients with fatal and nonfatal cases, and these data were correlated with the disease outcome. RNA copy levels in patients who died averaged 2 log(10) higher than those in patients who survived. Using clinical material from multiple EHF patients, we sequenced the variable region of the glycoprotein. This Sudan ebolavirus strain was not derived from either the earlier Boniface (1976) or Maleo (1979) strain, but it shares a common ancestor with both.

The reactions of the monoclonal antibodies showed that one (S1) of the two glycopolypeptides associated with the spike protein has a strain-specific region involved in neutralization and haemagglutination, and the membrane protein has antigenic determinants which are present on the three strains of IBV tested (M41, Beaudette and D41).","Mockett, A P; Cavanagh, D; Brown, T D",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6096499/,60
188123,"A multiplex RT-PCR for the detection of astrovirus, rotavirus, and reovirus in turkeys.",2012,"BACKGROUND Respiratory virus infections are the most important trigger of respiratory illnesses in childhood. Data on the occurrence and the clinical impact of respiratory pathogens in the general population of infants are scarce. Therefore, we described the occurrence and clinical impact of respiratory pathogens in infants with respiratory tract infections during the first year of life. METHODS In a prospective birth cohort study, infants were followed from birth through the first year of life with daily questionnaires about respiratory symptoms. Nose and throat swabs were collected during episodes with respiratory symptoms. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect an extensive panel of respiratory pathogens. RESULTS The parents reported a median of 5 respiratory episodes per infant per year. A total of 668 respiratory samples were collected in 305 infants. One or more respiratory pathogens were detected in 85% of the samples. The most common respiratory pathogens were human rhinovirus (HRV) (73% of the samples), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (11%), and coronavirus (8%). HRV infections were associated with a prolonged period of symptoms compared with RSV (P = 0.03). Infections with RSV were associated with more physician visits than HRV infections (P = 0.06). CONCLUSION We found a high prevalence of respiratory pathogens among infants with parent-reported respiratory illnesses in the first year of life, with HRV being the most prevalent. Although RSV infections seemed to be responsible for the most severe symptoms compared with HRV, the overall burden of disease was highest for HRV infections.","van der Zalm, Marieke M; Uiterwaal, Cuno S P M; Wilbrink, Berry; de Jong, Brita M; Verheij, Theo J M; Kimpen, Jan L L; van der Ent, Cornelis K",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19504730/,60

METHODS Seven patients with moderate COVID-19 met the discharge criteria enacted by National Health Commission were quarantined in hospital for 7 days, then continuously quarantined at home for 4 weeks after discharged. During the quarantined period, the symptoms and signs were documented, and sputum or nasal swab and feces samples were collected to test SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by RT-PCR method. RESULTS There was no symptoms and signs during the quarantine period in all 7 patients. However, respiratory swabs from 3 patients were confirmed positive of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid at 5 to 7 days after they met the discharge criteria. CONCLUSIONS There is a relatively high incidence of positive viral nucleic acid in patients met the discharge criteria, and it is suggested that patients met the current discharge criteria should be quarantined in hospital for another 7 days and the follow-up viral testing is necessary.","Li, Youjiang; Hu, Yingying; Zhang, Xiaodong; Yu, Yuanyuan; Li, Bin; Wu, Jianguo; Wu, Yingping; Xia, Xiaoping; Xu, Jian",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

This capacity has produced qualitative changes in the breadth of hypotheses that can be explored. In what has become the dominant mode of use, changes in the transcription rate of nearly all the genes in a genome, taking place in a particular tissue or cell type, can be measured in disease states, during development, and in response to intentional experimental perturbations, such as gene disruptions and drug treatments. The response patterns have helped illuminate mechanisms of disease and identify disease subphenotypes, predict disease progression, assign function to previously unannotated genes, group genes into functional pathways, and predict activities of new compounds. Directed at the genome sequence itself, microarrays have been used to identify novel genes, binding sites of transcription factors, changes in DNA copy number, and variations from a baseline sequence, such as in emerging strains of pathogens or complex mutations in disease-causing human genes. They also serve as a general demultiplexing tool to sort spatially the sequence-tagged products of highly parallel reactions performed in solution. A brief review of microarray platform technology options, and of the process steps involved in complete experiment workflows, is included.","Stoughton, Roland B",Annual review of biochemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15952881/,60

The purpose of this review is to provide the pathologist some familiarity with the clinical history, lesions, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of EVA. EVA is caused by an arterivirus (equine arteritis virus, EAV), and the vascular system is the principal but not unique viral target. EVA has variable presentations, including interstitial pneumonia, panvasculitis with edema, thrombosis and hemorrhage, lymphoid necrosis, renal tubular necrosis, abortion, and inflammation of male accessory genital glands. EAV antigen (EAVAg) can be demonstrated within the cytoplasm of epithelial cells such as alveolar pneumocytes, enterocytes, adrenal cortical cells, trophoblasts, thymus stroma, renal tubular cells, and male accessory genital gland cells. It can be also demonstrated within endothelia, in vascular, myometrial, and cardiac myocytes, macrophages, dendritelike cells of lymphoid organs, and chorionic mesenchymal stromal cells. In young and adult horses, following colonization of macrophages, the virus spreads systemically using circulating monocytes and enters the endothelium and tunica media of blood vessels, histiocytes, and dendritelike cells. Eventually, the virus multiplies within renal tubular cells. Lesions are uncommon in the aborted fetus; if present, they are mild, and EAVAg is frequently not detectable within fetal tissues and placenta. The clinical presentation and lesions of EVA may resemble those of other diseases. Complete pathologic examination associated with immunohistochemistry, virus isolation, and, especially in cases of abortion, serology will guarantee a directed and accurate diagnosis.","Del Piero, F",Veterinary pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10896389/,60
188711,Antiviral drug discovery against SARS-CoV.,2006,"This article aims to analyse the implementation of public procurement procedures in the context of national governments' fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and find solutions for adapting those public procurement procedures that are currently used in the healthcare sector to new challenges. For this above purpose, we have applied both theoretical methods such as analysis, synthesis, generalization, and empirical methods such as observation, etc. The research has yielded the following findings: 1) there are no one-size-fits-all solutions in the national governments' fight against the COVID-19 pandemic through the public procurement mechanism, except that national policies in this field intend to speed up the organisation of the public procurement procedures, which would shorten the time for the delivery of medical goods to healthcare facilities; 2) due to the current emergency conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, public procurements of medical supplies are taking place under the non-competitive procedure, i. e. with direct contracting of a specific vendor, which essentially increases corruption risks and allows for subjective decision making; 3) amid the increased corruption risks, there is a need to assign high priority to strengthening the public control (monitoring), as well as the governmental control over medical procurements; 4) saving of public funds as the underlying principle of some national public procurement systems becomes irrelevant in the face of such threats as the global COVID-19 pandemic; 5) it is quite difficult to speak of another principle - effective use of public funds - because we are now dealing with an emergency and the actors (both the government and the expert community) lack understanding of how things might potentially develop in the future. Thus, the authors offer the following solutions: 1) create temporary specialized bodies, with the cross-agency powers, at the national and regional levels, that would take on such functions as: coordination of procurements; needs analysis of particular areas in medical supplies; management of potential vendors. These measures may help make medical procurements as effective as possible in these current conditions; 2) develop special procedures (mechanisms), by national governments, for conducting checks of public procurements in the healthcare sector that are made as part of the response measures against the COVID-19 pandemic, because those check algorithms that are in place today cannot take into account the realities of this particular emergency situation and the conditions in which those procurements are made.","Ustymenko, V; Soshnykov, A; Tokarska, A; Makarenko, O; Nesterenko, K",Georgian medical news,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33964845/,60
188881,Comparison of infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) isolation on monolayers and in suspended cells.,2000,"International interest in the relationship between globalization and health is growing, and this relationship is increasingly figuring in foreign policy discussions. Although many globalizing processes are known to affect health, migration stands out as an integral part of globalization, and links between migration and health are well documented. Numerous historical interconnections exist between population mobility and global public health, but since the 1990s new attention to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases has promoted discussion of this topic. The containment of global disease threats is a major concern, and significant international efforts have received funding to fight infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome). Migration and population mobility play a role in each of these public health challenges. The growing interest in population mobility's health-related influences is giving rise to new foreign policy initiatives to address the international determinants of health within the context of migration. As a result, meeting health challenges through international cooperation and collaboration has now become an important foreign policy component in many countries. However, although some national and regional projects address health and migration, an integrated and globally focused approach is lacking. As migration and population mobility are increasingly important determinants of health, these issues will require greater policy attention at the multilateral level.","Macpherson, Douglas W; Gushulak, Brian D; Macdonald, Liane",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17486211/,60
189089,Novel SARS unique AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase.,2006,"The rubella virus (RUB) nonstructural (NS) protease is a papain-like cysteine protease (PCP) located in the NS-protein open reading frame (NSP-ORF) that cleaves the NSP-ORF translation product at a single site to produce two products, P150 (the N-terminal product) and P90 (the C-terminal product). The RUB NS protease was found not to function following translation in vitro in a standard rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, although all of the other viral PCPs do so. However, in the presence of divalent cations such as Zn2+, Cd2+, and Co2+, the RUB NS protease functioned efficiently, indicating that these cations are required either as direct cofactors in catalytic activity or for correct acquisition of three-dimensional conformation of the protease. Since other viral and cell PCPs do not require cations for activity and the RUB NS protease contains a putative zinc binding motif, the latter possibility is more likely. Previous in vivo expression studies of the RUB NS protease failed to demonstrate trans cleavage activity (J.-P. Chen et al., J. Virol. 70:4707-4713, 1996). To study whether trans cleavage could be detected in vitro, a protease catalytic site mutant and a mutant in which the C-terminal 31 amino acids of P90 were deleted were independently introduced into plasmid constructs that express the complete NSP-ORF. Cotranslation of these mutants in vitro yielded both the native and the mutated forms of P90, indicating that the protease present in the mutated construct cleaved the catalytic-site mutant precursor. Thus, RUB NS protease can function in trans.","Liu, X; Ropp, S L; Jackson, R J; Frey, T K",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9557742/,60

This led us to consider whether the observed heterogeneity is reflected by a quasispecies distribution of mutated RNA molecules within the infected organ. Coronavirus infection of rodents is a useful model system for investigating the pathogenesis of virus-induced central nervous system (CNS) disease. Here, we investigated whether genetic changes in the S gene occurred during virus persistence in vivo. We analysed the variability of S gene sequences directly from the brain tissue of Lewis rats infected with the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) variant JHM-Pi using RT-PCR amplification methods. The S gene sequence displayed a remarkable genetic stability in vivo. No evidence for a quasispecies distribution was found by sequence analysis of amplified S gene fragments derived from the CNS of Lewis rats. Furthermore, the S gene also remained conserved under the selection pressure of a neutralizing antibody. Only a few mutations predicted to result in amino acid changes were detected in single clones. The changes were not represented in the consensus sequence. These results indicate that to retain functional proteins under the constraints of a persistent infection in vivo, conservation of sequence can be more important than heterogeneity.","Stühler, A; Flory, E; Wege, H; Lassmann, H",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9129646/,60

The chromophoric crosslinkers are tetra-functionalized pyrazine molecules that bear a set of terminal aliphatic amine groups and a set of anilino amine groups, which demonstrate morphology-dependent reactivities towards the poly(acrylic acid) shell domain of the nano-objects. The extent to which the anilino amine groups react with the nano-object shell is shown to affect the hypsochromic shift (blue-shift). The ratio of fluorescence intensity at 496 nm over that of 560 nm is dependent upon the solution pH. We report, herein, observations on the pH-sensitive dual-emission photophysical properties of rod-shaped or spherical nano-objects, whose shell domains offer two distinct platforms for amidation reactions to occur-through formation of activated esters upon addition of carbodiimide or pre-installation of activated ester groups. We demonstrate that physical manipulations (changes in morphology or particle dimensions) or chemical manipulations of the crosslinking reaction (the order of installation of activated esters) lead to fine tuning of dual-emission over ca. 60 nm in a physiologically relevant pH range. Rod-shaped shell-crosslinked nanostructures with poly(p-hydroxystyrene) core show blue-shift as a function of increasing pH while spherical shell-crosslinked nanostructures with polystyrene core and poly(ethylene oxide) corona exhibit blue-shift as a function of decreasing pH.","Lee, Nam S; Sun, Guorong; Lin, Lily Yun; Neumann, William L; Freskos, John N; Karwa, Amolkumar; Shieh, Jeng J; Dorshow, Richard B; Wooley, Karen L",Journal of materials chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25506129/,60

Pro-inflammatory cytokines storm generated by Covid-19 infection hyper-activates inflammatory response in host body, resulting in elevated release of inflammatory biomarkers. Present article describes the characteristic profile of these inflammatory and related biomarkers in a total of 48 critically ill Covid-19 patients, (Male = 38, F = 10), with mildly ill to severe, critically ill status and thus grouped accordingly. Inflammatory Biomarkers, Ferritin, ProCalcitonin, C-Reactive Protein, coagulation marker-D-Dimer, chemical analytes, Protein, Albumin, BUN, Bilirubin, Creatinine, and enzymes, Lactate Dehydrogenase, γ-Glutamyl transpeptidases, Alkaline phosphatase were routine analyzed by standard methods described earlier. D-dimer, Ferritin, CRP and Procalcitonin exhibited variable alterations (P<0.05 to P<0.001), more markedly in critically ill patients than in the mild and severe. Biochemical analytes and enzymatic parameters showed elevated levels (P<0.05 to P<0.01) mostly in critically ill category of patients when compared with mild or severe, except total protein and albumin, which remained non-significant. It is concluded that cytokine, chemokines and pro-inflammatory markers, which released in abnormally high concentrations in Covid-19 patients of variable syndrome intensity, are significant indicators of disease severity, progression and success of treatments. As the pharmacological options may vary with the different stages of the disease therefore identifying the correct stage of the disease may be very useful in selecting the best option.","Alam, Junaid Mahmood; Asghar, Sarah Sughra; Ali, Humaira; Mahmood, Syed Riaz; Ansari, Maqsood Ali",Pakistan journal of pharmaceutical sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34275790/,60

By March 1999, the outbreak had spread to other pig-farming areas of the country, inclusive of the neighbouring country, Singapore. A total of 283 human cases of viral encephalitis with 109 deaths were recorded in Malaysia from 29 September 1998 to December 1999. During the outbreak period, a number of surveillances under three broad groups; Surveillance in Human Health Sector, Surveillance in Animal Health Sector, and Surveillance for the Reservoir Hosts, were carried out to determine the prevalence, risk of virus infections and transmission in human and swine populations as well as the source and reservoir hosts of Nipah virus. Surveillance data showed that the virus spread rapidly among pigs within infected farms and transmission was attributed to direct contact with infective excretions and secretions. The spread of the virus among pig farms within and between states of peninsular Malaysia was due to movement of pigs. The transmission of the virus to humans was through close contact with infected pigs. Human to human transmission was considered a rare event though the Nipah virus could be isolated from saliva, urine, nasal and pharyngeal secretions of patients. Field investigations identified fruitbats of the Pteropid species as the natural reservoir hosts of the viruses. The outbreak was effectively brought under control following the discovery of the virus and institution of correct control measures through a combined effort of multi-ministerial and multidisciplinary teams working in close co-operation and collaboration with other international agencies.","Chua, K B",The Malaysian journal of pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21329176/,60

Short-Term Studies: In 16-day studies, all five male and five female rats and mice dosed with 2,000 mg/kg benzyl alcohol died. Two of five male and 3/5 female rats and 1/5 male and 2/5 female mice dosed with 1,000 mg/kg died. Rats and mice of each sex in the two highest dose groups were lethargic after dosing. Other toxic responses to benzyl alcohol in these dose groups included blood around the mouth and nose, subcutaneous hemorrhages, and blood in the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts of rats and blood in the urinary bladder of mice. Animals administered lower doses of benzyl alcohol (125, 250, or 500 mg/kg) had no compound-related histologic lesions. Doses selected for the 13-week studies were 0, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg for rats and mice. Eight of 10 male rats dosed with 800 mg/kg died during weeks 7 and 8; four of these deaths were described as gavage related. Rats dosed with 800 mg/kg exhibited clinical signs indicative of neurotoxicity including staggering, respiratory difficulty, and lethargy. Hemorrhages occurred around the mouth and nose, and there were histologic lesions in the brain, thymus, skeletal muscle, and kidney. In mice, deaths were scattered among all dose levels, but none occurred in vehicle controls. Four male and six female mice died after being dosed; all deaths but one were described as gavage related. Staggering after dosing also occurred during the first 2 weeks of the studies in mice dosed with 800 mg/kg. Some of the deaths in the rats and mice may have been caused by a combination of the gavage procedure and chemical toxicity, since there was evidence that benzyl alcohol induced neurotoxic effects. There were reductions in relative weight gain in male rats dosed with 800 mg/kg benzyl alcohol, in female rats dosed with 200 mg/kg or more, in male mice dosed with 400 or 800 mg/kg, and in female mice dosed with 200 mg/kg or more. No notable changes in body weight gain or compound-related histopathologic lesions were observed in rats or mice from the lower dose groups. Based on mortality, reduction in relative body weight gain, and the histopathologic lesions, doses selected for 2-year studies in rats were 0, 200, and 400 mg/kg. Doses selected for 2-year studies in mice were 0, 100, and 200 mg/kg, based on mortality and depression in relative body weight gain. Body Weight and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Fifty animals of each species and sex were administered benzyl alcohol in corn oil by gavage 5 days per week for 103 weeks. Administration of benzyl alcohol did not affect survival in male rats (final survival rates: vehicle control, 28/50; low dose, 27/50; high dose, 24/50) but reduced survival of dosed female rats by half (36/50; 18/50; 17/50). Many of the early deaths were considered related to the gavage procedure. Survival in mice was not affected by benzyl alcohol administration (male: 34/50; 33/50; 35/50; female: 26/50; 32/50; 36/50). No effect of benzyl alcohol on body weight gain in rats or mice was observed. In the third month of the studies, clinical signs of sialodacryoadenitis virus infection were observed in rats. A positive serologic reaction for rat coronavirus was observed in sentinel animals at 6 months and again at 18 months. Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: No apparent compound-related nonneoplastic responses were observed. Dose-related negative trends in the incidences of anterior pituitary gland neoplasms were seen in female rats (vehicle control, 29/50; low dose, 17/47; high dose, 9/49) and of harderian gland adenomas in male mice (8/50; 3/50; 2/50). Adenomas of the adrenal cortex occurred at an increased incidence in high dose male mice (0/48; 0/44; 3/48), but this slight increase was not considered to be related to chemical expcal exposure. Genetic Toxicology: Benzyl alcohol was not mutagenic when tested by the preincubational protocol in the presence or absence of exogenous metabolic activation in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537. In the mouse L5178Y/TK± lymphoma assay, benzyl alcohol induced an increase in trifluorothymidine (Tft)-resistant cells in the absence, but not in the presence, of S9; the effect was associated with toxicity. In cytogenetic assays with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, treatment with benzyl alcohol produced an increase in sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) which was judged to be equivocal both with and without S9; a significant increase in chromosomal aberrations was observed after exposure to benzyl alcohol in the presence, but not the absence, of S9. Audit: The data, documents, and pathology materials from the 2-year studies of benzyl alcohol have been audited. The audit findings show that the conduct of the studies is documented adequately and support the data and results given in this Technical Report. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of benzyl alcohol for male or female F344/N rats dosed with 200 or 400 mg/kg. Survival in both dose groups of female rats was 50% that of vehicle controls, primarily due to an increased number of gavage-related deaths. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of benzyl alcohol for male or female B6C3F1 mice dosed with 100 or 200 mg/kg for 2 years.

METHODS We developed and tested a 29-question electronic questionnaire with Google forms asking respondents about their antimicrobial use and perceptions regarding appropriate antimicrobial use for real or perceived symptoms during the outbreak period. Respondents aged 18 years and above were recruited through crowd sourcing and they received the link to the survey tool through emails and social media including WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram. All data analysis was performed using SPSS version 26.0. RESULTS A total of 410 responses were received from the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria comprising 200 (48.8%) females and 210 (51.2%) males. Majority (62.9%) of the respondents had taken antimicrobials in the 3 months period preceding the survey, while less than half (46.8%) received prescription for it. Previous intake of antimicrobial for similar illness was a predictor of antimicrobial intake (OR: 0.55, 95%CI: 0.30-1.01). The most consumed antimicrobial was antimalarial drugs, specifically Artemisinin-based combination therapy (43.4%), followed by antibiotics [Ciprofloxacin (20.2%)]. CONCLUSION There was high levels of antimicrobial use for COVID-19 related symptoms by the Nigerian public. This is likely to escalate the already high prevalence of antimicrobial use previously reported and may further fuel the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.","Chukwu, E E; Musa, A Z; Enwuru, C; Ohihion, A; Bamidele, T; Olukosi, A; Idigbe, I; Osuolale, K A; Gab-Okafor, C; Salako, A; David, O; Otuonye, N; David, A; Toyosi, R; Aina, O; Adewale, B; Odunukwe, N N; Ezechi, O; Audu, R A; Salako, B L",West African journal of medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33764727/,60
190667,Identification and characterization of fully human anti-CD22 monoclonal antibodies.,2009,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), declared as a pandemic has affected millions of people and caused unprecedented number of death. The disease is caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronaviruses-2 virus which enters cells by binding with the host angiotensin converting enzyme-2 and CD147 protein. Among COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital, hypertension, diabetes and obesity are the most common co-morbidities. A majority of COVID-19 hospitalized patients are found to have proteinuria and hematuria which is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Studies have reported high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) among COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital (10 to 43%) and intensive care unit (43-75%). These patients with AKI have much higher need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use and critical care. In addition, proportion of patients with AKI who require renal replacement (RRT) therapy is greatly increased. Acute tubular injury, cytokine storm induced systemic inflammatory response, endothelial injury and dysfunction are the main mechanisms of AKI. In addition, direct viral invasion of tubules, lymphocytic infiltration and complement mediated (C5b- 9) related injury is also seen. Mortality risk among patients with AKI and those in need of RRT is greatly amplified. Appropriate timing and choice of RRT for these patients is not well defined but will need to take in account the clinical condition, anticipation of their clinical course and availability of dialysis resources. Risk of AKI and death is also increased among kidney recipients and patients with chronic kidney disease.","Goel, Narender; Jain, Deepika; Haddad, Danny B",Iranian journal of kidney diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33492298/,60

A patient with diabetes mellitus and hypertension for five years was admitted to the emergency unit with symptoms of fever, cough and dyspnoea. These symptoms were consistent with viral pneumonia and a COVID PCR test was performed, which tested positive three days later. The patient had chest pain on the eighth day of hospitalisation. On electrocardiography, simultaneous acute inferior and anterior STEMI were identified. High levels of stress and increased metabolic demand in these patients may lead to concomitant thrombosis of different coronary arteries, presenting with two different STEMIs.","Yolcu, Mustafa; Gunesdogdu, Fusun; Bektas, Metin; Bayirli, Derya Turan; Serefhanoglu, Kivanc",Cardiovascular journal of Africa,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32490506/,60

Low-neurovirulence TMEV result in a persistent central nervous system infection in mice, leading to an inflammatory demyelinating pathology and disease. Low- but not high-neurovirulence strains use sialic acid as an attachment factor. The recent resolution of the crystal structure of the low-neurovirulence DA virus in complex with the sialic acid mimic sialyllactose demonstrated that four capsid residues make contact with sialic acid through noncovalent hydrogen bonds. To systematically test the importance of these sialic acid-binding residues in viral entry and infection, we mutated three VP2 puff B amino acids proposed to make contact with sialic acid and analyzed the consequences of each amino acid substitution on viral entry and spread. The fourth residue is in the VP3-VP1 cleavage dipeptide and could not be mutated. Our data suggest that residues Q2161 and G2174 are directly involved in BeAn virus attachment to sialic acid and that substitutions of these two residues result in the loss of or reduced viral binding and hemagglutination and in the inability to spread among BHK-21 cells. In addition, a gain of function-revertant virus was recovered with the Q2161A mutation after prolonged passage in cells.","Kumar, A S Manoj; Kallio, Patricia; Luo, Ming; Lipton, Howard L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12552011/,60

Amiodarone, a drug used for the treatment of arrhythmias, has been shown to inhibit filovirus infection in vitro by acting at the early step of the viral replication cycle. Here we demonstrate that amiodarone reduces virus binding to target cells and slows down the progression of the viral particles along the endocytic pathway. Overall our data support the notion that amiodarone interferes with Ebola virus infection by affecting cellular pathways/ targets involved in the viral entry process.","Salata, Cristiano; Munegato, Denis; Martelli, Francesco; Parolin, Cristina; Calistri, Arianna; Baritussio, Aldo; Palù, Giorgio",The new microbiologica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29498743/,60
191523,Native nucleic acid electrophoresis as an efficient alternative for genotyping method of influenza virus.,2014,"The aim of the paper is to analyze the mechanism of compulsory licensing of medicines in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The methodological basis of the study encompasses the general and special methods of scientific inquiry (formal logical method, comparative law, structural-logical method, analysis and synthesis methods). The ways and possibilities of balancing the interests of rights-holders and society's interests (in particular patients' interests) have been studied. It is highlighted that compulsory licensing must be employed exclusively in view of the principle of proportionality, since any restrictions on human rights, including patent rights, must comply with the legislation in force and be proportionate to the potential threat. Comprehensive attention is paid to the interests of right holders (in our case, medicines manufacturers), their protection as well as the ways they abuse their patent rights. It is underlined that access to medicines and treatment is a prerequisite for the realization of the right to health and, consequently, is of social interest. However, in Ukraine today we face a situation in which the percentage of medicines purchased at patients' own expense is 88.2%. Such low medicines coverage on the part of the state is not characteristic of any European country. Compulsory licensing legislation, in particular, key international documents in this field, were thoroughly studied. The features of compulsory licensing have been formulated. The general trends regarding the use of this mechanism in the contemporary world have been determined. Based on the study, an evaluation of the effectiveness of compulsory licensing as a tool in the fight against abuse of patent rights is provided. There have been produced suggestions regarding amendments to the current legislation of Ukraine aiming to increase the effectiveness of compulsory licensing of medicines in general and under pandemic conditions in particular. First of all, it is an expansion of the sphere of compulsory licensing with respect to such intellectual property objects as industrial samples and trade secrets (know-hows). It is also suggested that the procedure for issuing compulsory licenses be expedited by the government's decision under pandemic or epidemic conditions.","Chepys, O",Georgian medical news,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33395660/,60

192064,Andes and Prospect Hill hantaviruses differ in early induction of interferon although both can downregulate interferon signaling.,2007,"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has impacted heavily on both Canada's society and its health care system. Quite unexpectedly, hospitals and health care workers became facilitators of disease diffusion. This experience has demonstrated the need for a comprehensive disease control strategy. AIMS The aims are threefold. First, to examine the subtle and changing spatial characteristics of SARS during the short but critical period of its rapid spread in the Greater Toronto Area. Second, to make salient three paradoxes, and their associated dilemmas, faced by nurses and other health care professionals challenged with caring for the sick and containing the rapid spread of the disease. Third, to propose some ways of approaching these dilemmas, as well as some broader preventative and mitigating strategies. METHODS The crosscutting concepts of 'clinical uncertainty' and 'flow of human contacts' are used to explain disease transmission characteristics and urban spatial diffusion and to guide the particular strategies developed. Evidence for the paper comes from public health records, governmental and non-governmental health statements and the initial epidemiological research on SARS. Direct insights are also gained from recent first-hand experiences of Toronto's health care system during the crisis. DISCUSSION The concepts of clinical uncertainty and the flow of human contacts provide in-depth insights that complement the findings of large-scale epidemiological studies, and help operationalize their general calls for enhanced control measures. The comprehensive disease control strategy proposed includes the creation of a hospital infrastructure specific to the containment of biological threats; an advisory coalition of disease control specialists; the development of a biological threat-and-containment simulation laboratory and three specific programmes in patient safety, risk assessment and community mobilization. CONCLUSION It is argued that containment alone, while a necessary and urgent priority, cannot be seen as an end in itself and might better be understood as one possible trajectory within a comprehensive problem-solving strategy. The experiences in Toronto may offer insights to other cities and countries that currently lack such strategies and hence may be vulnerable to similar outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases.","Affonso, Dyanne D; Andrews, Gavin J; Jeffs, Lianne",Journal of advanced nursing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15012634/,60

N protein is composed of three distinct regions containing RNA-binding motif(s), and appropriate signals for modulating cell signalling. The subcellular localization of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) N protein was studied. In infected cells, SARS-CoV N protein localized exclusively to the cytoplasm. In contrast to the avian coronavirus N protein, overexpressed SARS-CoV N protein remained principally localized to the cytoplasm, with very few cells exhibiting nucleolar localization. Bioinformatic analysis and deletion mutagenesis coupled to confocal microscopy and live-cell imaging, revealed that SARS-CoV N protein regions I and III contained nuclear localization signals and region II contained a nucleolar retention signal. However, cytoplasmic localization was directed by region III and was the dominant localization signal in the protein.","You, Jaehwan; Dove, Brian K; Enjuanes, Luis; DeDiego, Marta L; Alvarez, Enrique; Howell, Gareth; Heinen, Paul; Zambon, Maria; Hiscox, Julian A",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16298975/,60

Coronaviruses contain the largest single-stranded positive-polarity RNA genome in nature. The approximately 30-kb genome, coupled with regions of genomic instability, has hindered the development of a full-length infectious cDNA construct. We have assembled a full-length infectious construct of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), an important pathogen in swine. Using a novel approach, six adjoining cDNA subclones that span the entire TGEV genome were isolated. Each clone was engineered with unique flanking interconnecting junctions which determine a precise systematic assembly with only the adjacent cDNA subclones, resulting in an intact TGEV cDNA construct of approximately 28.5 kb in length. Transcripts derived from the full-length TGEV construct were infectious, and progeny virions were serially passaged in permissive host cells. Viral antigen production and subgenomic mRNA synthesis were evident during infection and throughout passage. Plaque-purified virus derived from the infectious construct replicated efficiently and displayed similar plaque morphology in permissive host cells. Host range phenotypes of the molecularly cloned and wild-type viruses were similar in cells of swine and feline origin. The recombinant viruses were sequenced across the unique interconnecting junctions, conclusively demonstrating the marker mutations and restriction sites that were engineered into the component clones. Full-length infectious constructs of TGEV will permit the precise genetic modification of the coronavirus genome. The method that we have designed to generate an infectious cDNA construct of TGEV could theoretically be used to precisely reconstruct microbial or eukaryotic genomes approaching several million base pairs in length.","Yount, B; Curtis, K M; Baric, R S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11044104/,60

This dual recognition of self and microbial ligands underlies innate-like antimicrobial functions mediated by CD40L induction and massive Th1 and Th2 cytokine and chemokine release. Through reciprocal activation of NKT cells and dendritic cells, synthetic NKT ligands constitute promising new vaccine adjuvants. NKT cells also regulate a range of immunopathological conditions, but the mechanisms and the ligands involved remain unknown.

DESIGN Prospective observational study of comatose cardiac arrest survivors. Subjects who survived to 1 month were included. SETTING Academic medical center ICU. PATIENTS Ninety-eight consecutive patients who remained comatose after resuscitation from cardiac arrest; 45 patients survived to 1 month. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patients' functional neurologic outcomes were assessed by phone call or in-person clinic visit at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postcardiac arrest using the modified Rankin Scale, Glasgow Outcome Scale, and Barthel Index. A ""good"" outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale 0-3, Barthel Index 70-100, and Glasgow Outcome Scale 4-5. Changes in dichotomized outcomes and shifts on each outcome scale were analyzed. The mean age of survivors was 51 ± 19 years and 18 (40%) were women. Five (19%) out of 26 patients with data available at all timepoints improved to good modified Rankin Scale outcome and none worsened to poor outcome between postarrest months 1 and 6 (p = 0.06). Thirteen patients (50%) improved on the modified Rankin Scale by 1-3 points and four (15%) worsened by 1-2 points between months 1 and 6 (overall improvement by 0.5 points; 95% CI, 0-1; p = 0.04). From postarrest months 6 to 12, there was no change in the number of patients with good versus poor outcomes. The modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index were more sensitive to detecting changes in outcome than the Glasgow Outcome Scale. CONCLUSIONS In initially comatose cardiac arrest survivors, improvements in functional status occur over the first 6 months after the event. There was no significant change in outcome between postarrest months 6 and 12. The modified Rankin Scale is a sensitive outcome scale in this population.","Tong, Julia T; Eyngorn, Irina; Mlynash, Michael; Albers, Gregory W; Hirsch, Karen G",Critical care medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27495816/,60

Depending on the strain of mouse and dose or strain of virus, infected mice may survive, become persistently infected, or die. We surveyed inbred mouse strains and found that for the majority tested the 50% lethal doses (LD(50)s) were >10(4.4) PFU. However, SJL/J mice were highly susceptible to MAV-1, with a mean LD(50) of 10(-0.32) PFU. Infected C3H/HeJ (resistant) and SJL/J (susceptible) mice showed only modest differences in histopathology. Susceptible mice had significantly higher viral loads in the brain and spleen at 8 days postinfection than resistant mice. Infection of primary macrophages or mouse embryo fibroblasts from SJL/J and C3H/HeJ mice gave equivalent yields of virus, suggesting that a receptor difference between strains is not responsible for the susceptibility difference. When C3H/HeJ mice were subjected to sublethal doses of gamma irradiation, they became susceptible to MAV-1, with an LD(50) like that of SJL/J mice. Antiviral immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels were measured in susceptible and resistant mice infected by an early region 1A null mutant virus that is less virulent that wild-type virus. The antiviral IgG levels were high and similar in the two strains of mice. Taken together, these results suggest that immune response differences may in part account for differences in susceptibility to MAV-1 infection.","Spindler, K R; Fang, L; Moore, M L; Hirsch, G N; Brown, C C; Kajon, A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11711594/,60

The insertion of an epidural catheter can provide continuous analgesia throughout labour. In addition, the catheter can be used to provide surgical anaesthesia, should operative delivery be required. Epidural local anaesthetics commonly produce maternal hypotension and motor blockade. However, opioids potentiate the effect of epidural local anaesthetics. Thus, concomitant epidural opioid injection allows the use of lower concentrations of local anaesthetics, decreasing the frequency and severity of hypotension and motor blockade. Epidural analgesia has other, potentially catastrophic, adverse effects but, with safe clinical practice, these problems are extremely rare. Intrathecal injection of opioids or local anaesthetics also effective labour analgesia. However, no single intrathecal drug or drug combination reliably provides analgesia for the duration of labour. Many clinicians use both intrathecal and epidural analgesia as a combined spinal-epidural technique. This approach provides the rapid onset of intrathecal drugs and the flexibility of continuous epidural block. Fetal heart rate decelerations occasionally follow the use of any of the above labour analgesic techniques. Most studies of the aetiology of fetal heart rate decelerations have focused on factors unique to each analgesic technique. However, the similar timing and appearance of fetal bradycardia suggests a common cause. Induction of maternal analgesia may transiently alter the balance between factors encouraging and inhibiting uterine contraction. A temporary increase in the uterotonic effects of endogenous or exogenous oxytocin may then produce a tetanic uterine contraction with subsequent decrease fetal oxygen delivery and resultant fetal bradycardia. Regardless of aetiology, these bradycardias are transient and should not produce maternal or fetal morbidity. Much controversy surrounds the effects of analgesia, especially epidural block, on the course and outcome of labour. Various studies have reported that epidural analgesia slows labour, increases the incidence of malposition of the fetal head, increases the need for forceps delivery and increases the risk of caesarean delivery. Most of the studies reporting these effects are retrospective and nonrandomised. More careful studies suggest that specific anaesthetic techniques (i.e. local anaesthetic-opioid mixtures) or obstetrical management can limit or eliminate these 'risks' of epidural labour analgesia.","Eberle, R L; Norris, M C",Drug safety,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8713692/,60

194850,Triaryl pyrazoline compound inhibits flavivirus RNA replication.,2006,"Several countries plan to introduce non-contact infrared thermometers (NCIT) at international airports in order to detect febrile passengers, thus to delay the introduction of a novel influenza strain. We reviewed the existing studies on fever screening by NCIT to estimate their efficacy under the hypothesis of pandemic influenza. Three Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or dengue fever interventions in airports were excluded because of insufficient information. Six fever screening studies in other gathering areas, mainly hospitals, were included (N= 176 to 72,327 persons; fever prevalence= 1.2% to 16.9%). Sensitivity varied from 4.0% to 89.6%, specificity from 75.4% to 99.6%, positive predictive value (PPV) from 0.9% to 76.0% and negative predictive value (NPV) from 86.1% to 99.7%. When we fixed fever prevalence at 1% in all studies to allow comparisons, the derived PPV varied from 3.5% to 65.4% and NPV was >or=99%. The low PPV suggests limited efficacy of NCIT to detect symptomatic passengers at the early stages of a pandemic influenza, when fever prevalence among passengers would be =or<1%. External factors can also impair the screening strategy: passengers can hide their symptoms or cross borders before symptoms occur. These limits should be considered when setting up border control measures to delay the pandemic progression.","Bitar, D; Goubar, A; Desenclos, J C",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19215720/,60

The results showed that LX4-type isolates are still the predominant IBVs circulating in chicken flocks in China, and these isolates could be grouped further into two clusters. Viruses in each cluster had favored amino acid residues at different positions in the S1 subunit of the spike protein. In addition, a recombination event was observed to have occurred between LX4- and tl/CH/LDT3/03I-type strains, which contributed to the emergence of a new strain. The most important finding of the study is the isolation and identification of Taiwan II-type (TW II-type) strains of IBV in mainland China in recent years. The genome of TW II-type IBV strains isolated in mainland China has experienced mutations and deletions, as demonstrated by comparison of the entire genome sequence with those of IBV strains isolated in Taiwan. Pathogenicity testing and sequence analysis of the 3' terminal untranslated region revealed that TW II-type IBV strains isolated in mainland China have a close relationship with the embryo-passaged, attenuated TW2296/95.","Ma, Huijie; Shao, Yuhao; Sun, Chuyang; Han, Zongxi; Liu, Xiaoli; Guo, Hongbo; Liu, Xiaozhen; Kong, Xiangang; Liu, Shengwang",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22545524/,60

Because many epidemic and bioterrorist agent illnesses involve respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation is a frequently required intervention but one that is in limited supply. In advance of such an event, we must develop triage criteria that depend on clinical indicators of survivability and resource utilization to allocate scarce health care resources to those who are most likely to benefit. These criteria must be tiered, flexible, and implemented regionally, rather than institutionally, with the backing of public health agencies and relief of liability.

These membranes were immunoisolated by using a monoclonal antibody against the viral nonstructural protein 2C. Biochemical analysis of the isolated membranes revealed that several organelles of the host cell (lysosomes, trans-Golgi stack and trans-Golgi network, and endoplasmic reticulum) contributed to the virus-induced membranous structures. Electron microscopy of infected cells preserved by high-pressure freezing revealed that the virus-induced membranes contain double lipid bilayers that surround apparently cytosolic material. Immunolabeling experiments showed that poliovirus proteins 2C and 3D were localized to the same membranes as the cellular markers tested. The morphological and biochemical data are consistent with the hypothesis that autophagy or a similar host process is involved in the formation of the poliovirus-induced membranes.","Schlegel, A; Giddings, T H; Ladinsky, M S; Kirkegaard, K",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8794292/,60

Despite the presence of backup generators, total electrical power failure may still occur. Life-support equipment should have a reliable internal battery to ensure patient safety. We tested the duration of operation of the internal battery of 4 intensive care ventilators. METHODS In our laboratory we evaluated one each of 4 ventilator models available in our facility (Evita XL, Puritan Bennett 840, Avea, and Servo 300), with volume-control and pressure-control ventilation, and with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of zero and 20 cm H(2)O. We then randomly selected and tested 6 Evita XL and 4 Servo 300 ventilators from our inventory to determine the variability of internal battery duration among ventilators of the same model. The ventilator settings were identical to the previous tests, other than fraction of inspired oxygen, which was set at 0.6, and PEEP was 5 cm H(2)O. RESULTS The battery-duration range of the tested ventilators was 20.5-170.5 min, and the mean +/- SD battery duration was 80.4 +/- 49.3 min. Changes in breath type and PEEP did not significantly impact battery duration. Among the ventilators of the same model, the battery-duration range was 5-69 min and the mean +/- SD battery duration was 28.9 +/- 21.4 min. Use of a compressor significantly shortened battery duration. There was no correlation between battery duration and battery age (r = -0.263). CONCLUSIONS The duration of ventilator operation on internal battery ranged widely among the tested devices. Clinicians need to be aware of these differences in the event of power failure.","Blakeman, Thomas C; Robinson, Bryce R H; Branson, Richard D",Respiratory care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20196881/,60

At present, there is no effective treatment or vaccine for COVID-19. Hand disinfection is a cost-effective way to prevent its transmission. According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, we should wash our hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs) with at least 60% alcohol are the alternative. With diligent hand disinfection reinforced during COVID-19, there is an increased prevalence of contact dermatitis. This commentary highlights the fact that contact dermatitis is a readily treatable condition and should not cause any deviation of proper hand hygiene. In irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), the management strategies are selection of less irritating hand hygiene products, frequent use of moisturisers to rebuild the skin barrier, and education on proper hand hygiene practices. In allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), the identification and avoidance of the contact allergen is the key to treatment. However, ACD is less common and only accounts for 20% of the cases. The identified allergens in hand cleansers are predominantly preservative excipients and ACD attributable to ABHR are very uncommon. Alcohol-free hand rubs are widely available on the market but it is not a recommended alternative to ABHRs by the CDC.","Tan, See Wei; Oh, Choon Chiat","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33241256/,60

In 2009, a novel strain of influenza A (H1N1) virus was identified, and pregnant women also were found to be at greater risk for influenza-related complications from this new virus. As a result, during the 2009--10 influenza season, two separate influenza vaccines were recommended to pregnant women: inactivated trivalent 2009--10 seasonal vaccine and influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine. To estimate influenza vaccination coverage among pregnant women during the 2009--10 influenza season, CDC analyzed data from 10 states from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which determined that vaccination coverage for pregnant women among the 10 states combined was 50.7% for seasonal influenza and 46.6% for 2009 H1N1. In addition, women to whom vaccination was offered or recommended by their health-care provider were significantly more likely to report being vaccinated against seasonal influenza (relative risk [RR] = 3.3) and 2009 H1N1 (RR = 10.1).

However, concerns such as insufficient cell engraftment in lungs and lack of large animal model data remain to be resolved. This study aimed to establish a simple method for evaluating cell retention in lungs and to develop reproducible approaches for efficient cell delivery into mouse and pig lungs. Human lung epithelial cells including normal human bronchial/tracheal epithelial (NHBE) cells and human lung epithelial cell line A549 were infected with pSicoR-green fluorescent protein (GFP) lentivirus. GFP-labeled NHBE cells were delivered via a modified intratracheal cell instillation method into the lungs of C57BL/6J mice. Two days following cell delivery, GFP ELISA-based assay revealed a substantial cell-retention efficiency (10.48 ± 2.86%, n = 7) in mouse lungs preinjured with 2% polidocanol. When GFP-labeled A549 cells were transplanted into Yorkshire pig lungs with a tracheal intubation fiberscope, a robust initial cell attachment (22.32% efficiency) was observed at 24 h. In addition, a lentiviral vector was developed to induce the overexpression and apical localization of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-GFP fusion proteins in NHBE cells as a means of ex vivo CFTR gene transfer in nonprogenitor (relatively differentiated) lung epithelial cells. These results have demonstrated the convenience and efficiency of direct delivery of exogenous epithelial cells to lungs in mouse and pig models and provided important background for future preclinical evaluation of intratracheal cell transplantation to treat lung diseases.","Gui, Liqiong; Qian, Hong; Rocco, Kevin A; Grecu, Loreta; Niklason, Laura E",American journal of physiology.

197302,Genetic variability of human respiratory coronavirus OC43.,2005,"The critical role of the cellular autophagy pathway in viral infection and pathogenesis has become increasingly apparent. Mounting evidences suggest that viruses have developed different strategies to meticulously modulate intracellular autophagy for their own benefits, thereby either promoting efficient viral replication or facilitating viral persistence. While our understanding of these strategies is still in its incipient stage, recent advances demonstrate that gamma herpesvirus Bcl-2 homolog (vBcl-2), which protects virus-infected cells from apoptosis, also suppresses cellular autophagy pathway through its direct interaction with the autophagy protein Beclin1. Interestingly, vBcl-2 has evolved to harbor the enhanced anti-autophagic activity compared to its host counterpart, suggesting an important role of cellular autophagy in response to viral infection and virus-associated pathogenesis. Thus, a detailed study of vBcl-2-mediated regulation of autophagy signal transduction pathway may lead to a better understanding of not only how virus escapes from host innate immunity but also how autophagy regulates viral infection and environmental stresses.","Liang, Chengyu; E, Xiaofei; Jung, Jae U",Autophagy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17993780/,60

According to the 'surviving sepsis campaign,' diagnosis of sepsis and infection is urgent; early and specific treatment is most effective to reduce complications and to decrease mortality. RECENT FINDINGS A variety of biomarkers of sepsis is presently available. The diagnostic spectrum of the various markers, however, is different. Some primarily indicate severity of inflammation (e.g. interleukin-6), others respond to infection, but do not indicate the host response well (endotoxin, lipoprotein binding protein, triggering receptor on myeloid cells). There are new markers with limited clinical experience, for example triggering receptor on myeloid cells or mid-pro atrial natriuretic peptide (Seristra, Brahms AG, Hennigsdorf, Germany). Procalcitonin is a well-established biomarker of sepsis that fulfills several criteria of clinical needs: it responds both to infection and severity of inflammation and thus has an impact on therapy. Recent studies indicate that antibiotic treatment can also be guided by procalcitonin. Further indications, including diagnosis of invasive bacterial infections and diagnosis of sepsis in neonates and children have been reported recently. SUMMARY Recent data and cumulative analyses indicate that biomarkers of sepsis improve diagnosis of sepsis. However, only a few markers have impact on therapy and fulfill the clinical requirements. Procalcitonin is a well-established marker, indicating infection, sepsis, and progression to the more severe stages of the disease. Today, this biomarker should be in the diagnostic portfolio of an intensive care unit or emergency ward.","Meisner, Michael",Current opinion in critical care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16175035/,60

Serum specimens from 10 SARS patients were analyzed by Western blotting and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using purified recombinant N and truncated S (S1, S2, and S3) proteins as antigens. Western blotting results demonstrated that 100% of the SARS patients tested positive for N protein-specific antibodies, 50% for S1 protein-specific antibodies, 30% for S2 protein-specific antibodies, and 70% for S3 protein-specific antibodies. The ELISA results, which showed positive rates of IgG reactivity against recombinant proteins N, S1, S2, and S3, were, respectively, 28.57, 14.29, 14.29, and 14.29% at week 1, 77.78, 55.56, 44.44, and 66.67% at week 2, 100, 75, 75, and 87.5% at week 3, and 100, 77.78, 77.78, and 88.89% after 3 weeks. The average titers of IgG against recombinant proteins N, S1, S2, and S3 were, respectively, 691, 56, 38, and 84 after 3 weeks. These results suggest that the recombinant proteins N and S3 are potentially useful antigens for a serological diagnosis of SARS. In consideration of possible cross-reactivity among N proteins of SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses, immunoassays using recombinant N protein in combination with S3 as antigens might improve the specificity of SARS diagnoses.","Wang, Yanbin; Chang, Zhaorui; Ouyang, Jing; Wei, Haiyan; Yang, Renquan; Chao, Yangong; Qu, Jianguo; Wang, Jianwei; Hung, Tao",DNA and cell biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16101351/,60

The guideline addresses six clinical questions: procedural efficacy as noted by relief of symptoms, resection weight, the impact of body mass index on surgical complications, use of prophylactic antibiotics, use of drains, and effect on quality of life. The evidence indicates that resection volume is not correlated directly to the degree of postoperative symptom relief. Increased breast resection weight may increase the risks of complication. The evidence is inconclusive on whether increased body mass index is associated with increased risk of complications. Perioperative antibiotics may reduce the risk of infection associated with reduction mammaplasty, and in standard reduction mammaplasty procedures without liposuction, the use of drains is not beneficial.

Twenty-five patients completed the full course of radiographs in the hospital. The initial radiographic features and the distribution of parenchymal, mediastinal, and pleural abnormalities for each patient were evaluated. Follow-up radiographic findings were correlated with clinical outcomes for these patients. RESULTS Initial chest radiographs showed abnormalities in 23 (88%) of 26 subjects. Eighteen patients (69%) had air-space consolidation, two (8%) had ground-glass attenuation, one (4%) had nodules, and two (8%) had mixed consolidation and nodules. Four patients (15%) had pleural effusion. Younger patients and those with normal initial radiographic findings or unifocal lung lesions had better outcomes. CONCLUSION The initial predominant radiographic feature of SARS was air-space consolidation in the lateral and lower lung zones.

200919,Minimal system for assembly of SARS-CoV-2 virus like particles,2020,"OBJECTIVE To study on the dynamics of peripheral blood lymphocytes and their subpopulations in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. METHODS Using flow cytometry, the absolute numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes and their subpopulations in 240 SARS patients (696 specimens) and 51 individuals as controls, were counted and compared. RESULTS The absolute numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes and their subpopulations (CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8) were 1298 +/- 785, 897 +/- 606, 510 +/- 372, 362 +/- 263/mm(3), respectively, significantly lower in SARS patients as compared to the normal controls (2024 +/- 423, 1391 +/- 289, 795 +/- 129, 551 +/- 183/mm(3)). Of SARS patients, severe group (1095 +/- 740, 740 +/- 562, 419 +/- 346, 304 +/- 244/mm(3)) had lower counts than that of mild group (1404 +/- 788, 991 +/- 612, 564 +/- 378, 396 +/- 267/mm(3)), and in group with deaths (587 +/- 493, 369 +/- 371, 204 +/- 191, 150 +/- 130/mm(3)) was lower than that of recovery group (1355 +/- 776, 948 +/- 603, 539 +/- 375, 382 +/- 263/mm(3)). There were significant differences (P < 0.01) for CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, but with no significant difference (P > 0.05) for CD4/CD8 ratio between severe and mild, recovery and death groups. The lymphocytes and their subpopulations (CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8) declined in the 1st week and to the lowest level (977 +/- 579, 641 +/- 466, 360 +/- 275, 270 +/- 216/mm(3)) in the 2nd week. Then the lymphocytes and their subpopulations gradually increased during the recovery of the disease. CONCLUSION The absolute numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes and their subpopulations in SARS patients might be used as one of the methods for diagnosis on the severity and prognosis of the disease.","He, Zhong-ping; Dong, Qing-ming; Zhuang, Hui; Song, Shu-jing; Liu, Zhi-ying; Feng, Xin",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15132864/,60

PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 28 patients with rectal lesions were treated using TAMIS at Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust. Outcome measures included feasibility of excision, negative margin (R0) resection rate, length of hospital stay, morbidity and mortality, and postoperative quality of life associated with anal incontinence. Results; TAMIS was feasible in 90% of cases. R0 resection was 82%. The mean length of hospital stay was 1.5 days. Six (21%) patients experienced acute urinary retention postoperatively. One (4%) patient was re-admitted with rectal bleeding. One patient experienced a perforation. Mortality was 0%. Postoperative quality of life indicated low severity of symptoms of anal incontinence. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that TAMIS is a feasible option in the treatment of rectal tumours and does not impair quality of life postoperatively.","Sumrien, Haytham; Dadnam, Christopher; Hewitt, Jonathan; McCarthy, Kathryn",Anticancer research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27069194/,60

201651,Label-free fluorometric detection of influenza viral RNA by strand displacement coupled with rolling circle amplification,2021,"The capacity of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) to replicate in vitro decreases tremendously when animal cell cultures are exposed to ligands of both the alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) receptor and IFN-gamma receptor prior to inoculation with low m.o.i.s of HSV-1. However, the available evidence provides no insight into the possible mechanisms by which co-activation of the IFN-alpha/beta- and IFN-gamma-signalling pathways produces this effect. Therefore, it has not been possible to differentiate between whether these observations represent an important in vitro model of host immunological suppression of HSV-1 infection or an irrelevant laboratory phenomenon. Therefore, the current study was initiated to determine whether co-activation of the host cell's IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma pathways either (i) induced death of HSV-1-infected cells such that virus replication was unable to occur; or (ii) disrupted one or more steps in the process of HSV-1 replication. To this end, multiple steps in HSV-1 infection were compared in populations of Vero cells infected with HSV-1 strain KOS (m.o.i. of 2.5) and exposed to ligands of the IFN-alpha/beta receptor, the IFN-gamma receptor or both. The results demonstrated that IFN-beta and IFN-gamma interact in a synergistic manner to block the efficient synthesis of viral DNA and nucleocapsid formation in HSV-1-infected cells and do so without compromising host-cell viability. It was inferred that IFN-mediated suppression of HSV-1 replication may be a central mechanism by which the host immune system limits the spread of HSV-1 infection in vivo.","Pierce, Amy T; DeSalvo, Joanna; Foster, Timothy P; Kosinski, Athena; Weller, Sandra K; Halford, William P",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16099899/,60

The objective of this study was to analyze its impact on pediatric surgical activity at a reference healthcare facility. MATERIAL AND METHODS A comparative study of activity in the pediatric surgery environment at a Spanish reference healthcare facility was carried out. It included outpatient consultations, scheduled surgeries, and activity at the emergency department during the lockdown period in Spain (March-May 2020) vs. the same 2019 period. Number of consultations and surgeries, type of surgery performed and/or cancelled, and stage of the pathologies treated were collected. RESULTS A 98% decrease in scheduled surgeries, an 84% decrease in healthcare burden from the pediatric emergency department, a 55.24% decrease in urgent surgeries, an 82% decrease in outpatient activity at external consultations, and a 94% decrease in inter-hospital referrals, along with a 66% increase in urgent pathology severity, were found. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic cancelled virtually all pediatric surgery activity, which caused treatment delays in severe pathologies and increased morbidity in regular urgent procedures.","Álvarez García, N; Núñez García, B; Pérez-Gaspar, M; Jiménez Gómez, J; Betancourth Alvarenga, J; Santiago Martínez, S; Jiménez Arribas, P; Esteva Miró, C; Güizzo, J",Cirugia pediatrica : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Cirugia Pediatrica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33507642/,60

It has been demonstrated that, besides the major canonical transcripts, the viral genome also codes for non-canonical RNA molecules. While the structural characterizations have revealed a detailed transcriptomic architecture of the virus, the kinetic studies provided poor and often misleading results on the dynamics of both the viral and host transcripts due to the low temporal resolution of the infection event and the low virus/cell ratio (MOI=0.1) applied for the infection. In this study, we used direct cDNA and direct RNA nanopore sequencings for the generation of high-coverage, high-temporal-resolution transcriptomic datasets on SARS-CoV-2 and on primate host cells infected with a high virus titer (MOI=5). Sixteen sampling time points ranging from 1 to 96h with a varying time resolution and three biological replicates were used in the experiment for both the infected and the non-infected cells.","Tombacz, Dora; Dormo, Akos; Gulyas, Gabor; Csabai, Zsolt; Prazsak, Istvan; Kakuk, Balazs; Harangozo, Akos; Jankovics, Istvan; Denes, Bela; Boldogkoi, Zsolt",,,60

Fe-Mn/AC catalysts with different Fe/Mn molar ratios were prepared by hydrothermal method, and the physical and chemical properties of the samples were explored by different characterization techniques, including XRD, SEM, TEM and XPS. The results showed that the combination of DBD with Fe2-Mn1/AC system had the highest effect, and the degradation efficiency of TCH could reach 98.8 % after 15 min treatment, which was 25.5 % higher than that of DBD-only. With the increase of discharge voltage and catalyst dosage, the degradation efficiency of TCH promoted. And initial pH had little effect on the degradation of TCH. In the combined system, the Fe2-Mn1/AC catalyst could retain an excellent stability and reusability. The addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) showed that ·OH participated in the TCH degradation. The generated O3 might be catalyzed by Fe-Mn/AC catalyst to produce more ·OH. And more H2O2 was produced in DBD-only system than that in DBD-catalytic system. Nine main degradation intermediate products in the combined system were detected by HPLC-MS, and three possible degradation pathways were proposed.","Cheng, Jian; Xie, Yirui; Wei, Ying; Xie, Dongrun; Sun, Wenbo; Zhang, Ying; Li, Menghong; An, Jiutao",Chemosphere,,60

217395,Understanding Human Coronavirus HCoV-NL63,2020,"The worldwide pandemic caused by the COVID-19 outbreak has led to an unprecedented burden on hospital structures, posing new challenges in terms of reshaping healthcare services. At the same time, the so-called 'lockdown' restrictions have decreased overall mobility, thereby challenging the traditional concept of clinical examination. Moreover, the need for security for both patients and healthcare personnel has posed a further limitation to face-to-face meeting. Telemedicine has provided a valuable solution for such issues, allowing the evaluation of oral and maxillofacial surgery patients through technological interfaces, restricting physical consultations to cases with high clinical priority, intercepting suspects, and maintaining contact with discharged patients. Thanks to the experience gained during the previous wave of infections, the purpose of this study was to present a reorganization of clinical services for oral and maxillofacial surgery in order to help cope with the latest COVID-19 resurgence. Using commonly available software for telecommunications and online meetings, the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department of the University Hospital of Udine has reshaped the organization of healthcare services, with telemedicine central to the continuity of assistance, while at the same time minimizing the risk of exposure for both patients and operators. Additionally, the high number of patients evaluated through telemedicine improved our ability to define signs and symptoms of diseases using informatic tools, thus allowing the introduction of the concept of 'telesemiology'. During our previous lockdown experience, between March and April 2020, 78 patients were evaluated using teleconsultation. All outpatient examinations were rescheduled and translated into a virtual platform, allowing each patient to undergo evaluation in the most appropriate setting. Special attention was paid to the follow-up of oncological patients. The rehabilitation team represented a crucial element in maintaining contact with more complex patients in this crucial time. This study was based on our previous lockdown experience - a situation that many will be facing again over the coming months. Our hope is that the organizational structure that our department applied during the previous wave of infections may offer other colleagues a solution to facing the current COVID-19 recrudescence.","Robiony, Massimo; Bocin, Elena; Sembronio, Salvatore; Costa, Fabio; Arboit, Lorenzo; Tel, Alessandro",J Craniomaxillofac Surg,,60

This study aims to identify Burnout in physicians working in COVID ICU and isolation Ward. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 physicians who had worked in either COVID ICU or Isolation ward. A survey of 23 questions was designed to assess the work-related Burnout using the Copenhagen burnout inventory and the implementation of NIH guidelines. RESULTS: Among the 200 physicians, 151 (75.5%) were well informed of the guidelines, of which 52 (34.4%) participants believed the guidelines were not sufficient. These 34.4% of individuals showed a mean burnout score of 70.05% (p-value 0.001). Medical registrars and Medical Officers suffered the highest burnout mean percentage score of 76% and 72.42%, respectively. 89 (44.5%) individuals arranged PPE suits on their own and suffered a burnout score of 71.3% ±14.35 (p-value &lt;0.001). Seventy-two (36%) claimed their administration was not cooperative in resolve safety issues. These individuals showed a mean burnout score of 74.3% ±13.82 (p-value &lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Lack of physician's faith in the adequacy of the NIH guidelines has been found to be a significant factor in contributing to work-related Burnout. Due to the shortage of PPE, a majority of physicians have to reuse their PPE multiple times and even have to personally arrange their PPE suits, which further compounds the burnout. Increase administrative cooperation in resolving issues related to safety measures should help elevate work-related burnout in physicians working in the ICU and isolation ward.","Hussain, M.; Amjad, M.

Prior to these, many Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) had embraced the concept of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and have either commenced or are in the process of implementing various models of health insurance in order to provide financial access to health care to their populations. While evidence of a relationship between experimentation with UHC and increased access to and utilisation of health care in LMICs is common, there is inadequate research evidence on the specific health financing model that is most appropriate for pursuing the objectives of UHC in these settings. Drawing on a synthesis of empirical and theoretical discourses on the feasibility of UHC in LMICs, this paper argues that the journey towards UHC is not a ‘one size fits all’ process, but a long-term policy engagement that requires adaptation to the specific socio-cultural and political economy contexts of implementing countries. The study draws on the WHO's framework for tracking progress towards UHC using the implementation of a mildly progressive pluralistic health financing model in Ghana and advocates a comprehensive discourse on the potential for LMICs to build resilient and responsive health systems to facilitate a gradual transition towards UHC. © 2021 The Author","Domapielle, M.

Among the 81 cemetery workers, 76 provided an NPS and five (6.6%) were PCR positive; 64 provided a blood sample and 22 (34.4%) were antibody positive, three (13.6%) who were seropositive were also PCR positive. Three (22.2%) and 20 (83.3%) of the infected mortuary and cemetery workers were asymptomatic, respectively. Age <30 years (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.7-14.6), community exposure with a known case (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.7-13.3), and presence of symptoms in the preceding 2 weeks (OR 9.0, 95% CI 1.9-42.0) were independently associated with an increased risk of infection (PCR or antibody positive). Of the 46 environmental and surface samples, all were negative or had a Ct value of >35. CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of mortuary and cemetery workers had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was incidentally detected upon serologic testing. These data are most consistent with community acquisition rather than occupational acquisition.","Alishaq, Moza; Jeremijenko, Andrew; Nafady-Hego, Hanaa; Al Ajmi, Jameela Ali; Elgendy, Mohamed; Fadel, Rayyan Abdulaziz Attya; Thomas, Anil George; Alahmed, Mohammed A A; Ammar, Adham; Bensaad, Meryem; Al-Barghouthi, Bayan; Coyle, Peter; Elgendy, Hamed; Abou-Samra, Abdul-Badi; Butt, Adeel A",Int J Infect Dis,,60
245977,COVID19 meets the antivaccine movement,2020,"The aim of this article is to study systematically current evidence on status of arthroscopic surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to study (1) changes in global arthroscopic practices, (2) recommendations on reducing risk to patients and health care workers (HCW), (3) changes in follow-up protocols of these patients. Systematic search was carried out by two different reviewers using three different online databases for all studies published in the English language before April 2020. The total number of abstracts screened initially was 314. After screening of these abstracts, a total of 13 studies were included for the systematic review. Numbers of orthopaedic injuries have seen a sharp fall during this time. Most elective surgical facilities were also closed at this time. Most studies have recommended telemedicine as an essential medium of providing continued care to patients during COVID-19. Studies have recommended that a conservative approach should be preferred for most patients with ligament injuries, and alternative procedures that have less requirement for an operating room should be explored. Common recommendation in all studies is that procedures of more elective nature should be postponed to a safer time frame when the transmission of COVID-19 virus in the population has declined. When surgeries are resumed, there is a need for triage of arthroscopy procedures from more important or urgent to less important ones. Elective surgical procedures should preferably be started with patients with no co-morbidities and lesser risk of peri-operative complications. All patients undergoing surgery and health care personnels should have some screening for disease. Attempts should be made to have shortest hospital stay. Choice of anaesthetic procedure should emphasize on minimal aerosolization of the virus. Regional anaesthesia is the preferred choice as far as possible. Most guidelines have recommended that patient follow up should be made telephonically or on video-conferencing.","Goyal, Tarun; Harna, Bushu; Taneja, Ashish; Maini, Lalit",J. Arthrosc. Jt. Surg.,,60

TRIAL DESIGN: Two separate multi-centre placebo-controlled parallel group randomized trials PARTICIPANTS: (1) Health care personnel working in the hospital or ambulance service where they will take care of patients with the COVID-19 infection and (2) elderly &#8805;60 years. The HCW trial is being undertaken in 9 hospitals. The elderly trial is being undertaken in locations in the community in Nijmegen, Utrecht, and Veghel, in the Netherlands, using senior citizen organisations to facilitate recruitment. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: For both trials the intervention group will be randomized to vaccination with 0.1 ml of the licensed BCG vaccine (Danish strain 1331, SSI, Denmark, equivalent to 0.075 mg attenuated M. bovis). The placebo group consists of 0.1 ml 0.9% NaCl, which is the same amount, and has the same colour and appearance as the suspended BCG vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES: (1) Number of days of unplanned work absenteeism in HCWs for any reason which can be continuously measured on a bi-weekly basis, and (2) the cumulative incidence of hospital admission due to documented COVID-19. RANDOMISATION: Participants will be randomized to BCG vaccine or placebo (1;1) centrally using a computer- based system, stratified by study centre. BLINDING (MASKING): Subjects, investigators, physicians and outcome assessors are blinded for the intervention. Only the pharmacist assistant that prepares- and research personnel that administers- study medicines are unblinded. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): (1) The sample size for the first trial is N=1500 HCWs randomised 1:1 to either BCG vaccine (n=750) and placebo (n=750) and (2) The sample size for the second trial is N=1600 elderly persons randomised to BCG vaccine (n=800) and the placebo group (n=800).

257184,Proteomics advances towards developing SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics using in silico drug repurposing approaches,2021,"Using the parameterized susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, we simulated the spread dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and impact of different control measures, conducted the sensitivity analysis to identify the key factor, plotted the trend curve of effective reproductive number (R), and performed data fitting after the simulation. By simulation and data fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59 769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with the coefficient of determination close to 1 and the fitting bias 3.02%, suggesting high precision of the data-fitting results. More rigorous government control policies were associated with a slower increase in the infected population. Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of the treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance. There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound, and another continuous decline. The feature of high infectiousness for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) led to an upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions. Evidence from the four-phase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients' being admitted to designated hospitals, and comprehensive therapeutic strategy. Collaborative efforts are required to combat the novel coronavirus, focusing on both persistent strict domestic interventions and vigilance against exogenous imported cases.","Fang, Yaqing; Nie, Yiting; Penny, Marshare",J Med Virol,,60
257935,Animal models for SARS-CoV-2,2021,"BACKGROUND: Primary rhesus monkey kidney cells (RhMK) can be used for the detection of respiratory viruses, including influenza and parainfluenza. The human colon adeno-carcinoma cell line, CACO-2, has been previously used for the growth of multiple influenza viruses, including seasonal, novel and avian lineages. OBJECTIVE: We compared CACO-2, Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK), and RhMK cells for the isolation of viruses from patients presenting with influenza like-illness (ILI). STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal specimens from patients with ILI in primary care settings were processed for conventional viral culture in MDCK, RhMK, and CACO-2. Cells were examined microscopically for cytopathic effect (CPE) and confirmatory testing included immunofluorescent antigen (IFA) detection and real-time RT-PCR. Additionally, 16 specimens positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by PCR were inoculated on CACO-2 cells. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square test with IBM Statistical Program. RESULTS: Of 1031 respiratory specimens inoculated, viruses were isolated and confirmed from 331 (32.1 %) in MDCK cells, 304 (29.5 %) in RhMk cells, and 433 (42.0 %) in CACO-2 cells. These included influenza A/(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), influenza B, parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1, 2, and 3, human coronavirus 229E (CoV-229E), human adenovirus (HAdV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV 1), and enterovirus (EV). Influenza A viruses grew best in the CACO-2 cell line. Time to observation of CPE was similar for all three cell types but unlike RhMK and MDCK cells, virus-specific morphological changes were indistinguishable in CACO-2 cells. None of the 16 specimens positive for RSV by PCR grew on CACO-2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The overall respiratory virus culture isolation rate in CACO-2 cells was significantly higher than that in RhMK or MDCK cells (p < 0.05). CACO-2 cells also supported the growth of some viruses that did not grow in either RhMK or MDCK cells. Except for RSV, CACO-2 cells provide a worthwhile addition to culture algorithms for respiratory specimens.","Ramani, Rama; Laplante, Jennifer M; Church, Theresa M; Farrell, Gregory M; Lamson, Daryl M; St George, Kirsten",J Virol Methods,,60

266388,"An overview of coronaviruses including the SARS-2 coronavirus - Molecular biology, epidemiology and clinical implications",2020,"During March 29-April 25, 2020, emergency department (ED) visits in the United States declined by 42% after the declaration of a national emergency for COVID-19 on March 13, 2020. Among children aged &#8804;10 years, ED visits declined by 72% compared with prepandemic levels (1). To assess the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on EDs, CDC examined trends in visits since December 30, 2018, and compared the numbers and types of ED visits by patient demographic and geographic factors during a COVID-19 pandemic period (December 20, 2020-January 16, 2021) with a prepandemic period 1 year earlier (December 15, 2019-January 11, 2020). After an initial decline during March-April 2020 (1), ED visits increased through July 2020, but at levels below those during the previous year, until December 2020-January 2021 when visits again fell to 25% of prepandemic levels. During this time, among patients aged 0-4, 5-11, 12-17, and &#8805;18 years, ED visits were lower by 66%, 63%, 38%, and 17%, respectively, compared with ED visits for each age group during the same period before the pandemic. Differences were also observed by region and reasons for ED visits during December 2020-January 2021; more visits during this period were for infectious diseases or mental and behavioral health-related concerns and fewer visits were for gastrointestinal and upper-respiratory-related illnesses compared with ED visits during December 2019-January 2020. Although the numbers of ED visits associated with socioeconomic factors and mental or behavioral health conditions are low, the increased visits by both adults and children for these concerns suggest that health care providers should maintain heightened vigilance in screening for factors that might warrant further treatment, guidance, or intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Adjemian, Jennifer; Hartnett, Kathleen P; Kite-Powell, Aaron; DeVies, Jourdan; Azondekon, Roseric; Radhakrishnan, Lakshmi; van Santen, Katharina L; Rodgers, Loren",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,60

Circulating monocytes and tissue macrophages participate in all stages of SARS COVID-19. They contribute to comorbidities predisposing to clinical infection, virus resistance and dissemination, and to host factors that determine disease severity, recovery and sequelae. Assays are available to detect viral infection and antibody responses, but no adequate tests have been developed to measure the activation level of monocytes and tissue macrophages, and the risk of progression to a fatal hyperinflammatory syndrome. Blood monocytes provide a window on the systemic immune response, from production to tissue recruitment, reflecting the impact of infection on the host. Ready availability of blood makes it possible to monitor severity and the risk of potentially lethal complications, by developing tests to assess the status of monocyte activation and its potential for further inflammatory dysregulation after recruitment to tissues and during recovery.","Martinez, Fernando O; Combes, Theo W; Orsenigo, Federica; Gordon, Siamon",EBioMedicine,,60
269255,The Challenges of Vaccine Development against a New Virus during a Pandemic,2020,"The rapid detection of ongoing outbreak - and the identification of causative pathogen - is pivotal for the early recognition of public health threats. The emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases are linked to several determinants, both human factors - such as population density, travel, and trade - and ecological factors - like climate change and agricultural practices. Several technologies are available for the rapid molecular identification of pathogens [e.g. real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)], and together with on line monitoring tools of infectious disease activity and behaviour, they contribute to the surveillance system for infectious diseases. Web-based surveillance tools, infectious diseases modelling and epidemic intelligence methods represent crucial components for timely outbreak detection and rapid risk assessment. The study aims to integrate the current prevention and control system with a prediction tool for infectious diseases, based on regression analysis, to support decision makers, health care workers, and first responders to quickly and properly recognise an outbreak. This study has the intention to develop an infectious disease regressive prediction tool working with an off-line database built with specific epidemiological parameters of a set of infectious diseases of high consequences. The tool has been developed as a first prototype of a software solution called Infectious Diseases Seeker (IDS) and it had been established in two main steps, the database building stage and the software implementation stage (MATLAB® environment). The IDS has been tested with the epidemiological data of three outbreaks occurred recently: severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in China (2002-2003), plague outbreak in Madagascar (2017) and the Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2018). The outcomes are promising and they reveal that the software has been able to recognize and characterize these outbreaks. The future perspective about this software regards the developing of that tool as a useful and user-friendly predictive tool appropriate for first responders, health care workers, and public health decision makers to help them in predicting, assessing and contrasting outbreaks.","Baldassi, F; Cenciarelli, O; Malizia, A; Gaudio, P",Journal of epidemiology and global health (Online),,60

The model considers the contribution to the dynamics by people who are susceptible, infectious, isolated, deceased but still infectious and not yet buried, as well as the dynamics of the pathogen at interacting nodes or patches. Humans can move between patches carrying the disease to any patch in a region of n communities (patches). Both direct and indirect transmission are accounted for in this model. Matrix and graph-theoretic methods and some combinatorial identities are used to construct appropriate Lyapunov functions to establish global stability results for both the disease-free and the endemic equilibrium of the model.

METHOD: A national survey was performed among all 148 hospitals providing CRC services. Information was collected about changes in referrals, diagnostic, staging and therapeutic procedures, as well as whether there was access to a 'cold site' (a hospital facility free of COVID-19). Clinicians in each hospital were also asked to give the 'single most important lesson learned' about keeping services safe and effective. RESULTS: Full responses were received from 123 (83%) hospitals, and information about 'cold sites' was available for 146 (99%). Eighty hospitals (54%) had access to a 'cold site' and this was increased in regions with higher COVID-19 infection rates (p <0.001). Of the 123 responding hospitals, 105 (85%) indicated that referrals of patients with suspected CRC had dropped by at least 30%, and 69 (56%) indicated that treatment plans were altered in at least 50% of CRC patients. However, 'cold site' availability protected the capacity for diagnostic colonoscopy (p = 0.013) and CRC resection (p = 0.010). Many 'lessons learned' highlighted the importance of adequate structural service organization, often mentioning 'cold sites' and regional coordination as examples, good communication and triage of patients based on clinical urgency. CONCLUSION: Access to 'cold sites', as well as regional coordination, clear communication and strong leadership, were found to be pivotal in maintaining capacity for diagnosis and treatment of CRC during the COVID-19 surge.","Boyle, Jemma M; Kuryba, Angela; Blake, Helen A; Aggarwal, Ajay; van der Meulen, Jan; Walker, Kate; Braun, Michael; Fearnhead, Nicola",Colorectal dis,,60

Results: Linear regressions indicated self-isolation and coping with depression motives for cannabis use during the pandemic were significant predictors of pandemic cannabis use levels after accounting for pre-pandemic use levels. There was no interaction between coping with depression motives and self-isolation on cannabis use during the pandemic. Conclusions: Those who engaged in self-isolation were found to use 20% more cannabis during the pandemic than those who did not. Our results suggest that self-isolation is a unique risk factor for escalating cannabis use levels during the pandemic. Thus, self-isolation may inadvertently lead to adverse public health consequences in the form of increased cannabis use.","Bartel, S J; Sherry, S B; Stewart, S H",Subst Abus,,60

This study aimed to assess the associations among emotional reactions toward COVID-19, knowledge about COVID-19, perceived susceptibility to this disease, and subjective health status. This study was a cross-sectional study conducted among 1,085 Israeli adults who completed an online survey between April 23 and May 5, 2020. The self-administered questionnaire included questions about emotional reactions to COVID-19, knowledge about COVID-19, perceived susceptibility, subjective health status, and sociodemographic variables. Participants (aged 18-96) reported high levels of emotional reactions to COVID-19. Most respondents were worried (77.4%), afraid (62.8%) or stressed (55.3%). Emotional reaction scores were higher among women than among men. In the regression model, emotional reactions were higher for older participants, those who rated their subjective health status as poorer, and those who were employed, with the final model explaining 11.6% of the variance in emotional reactions. Perceived susceptibility significantly mediated the relationship between subjective health status and emotional reactions. The high prevalence of emotional responses among women, older people and those with lower subjective health ratings points to the need for intervention programs primarily targeting these groups.","Inbar, Levkovich; Shinan-Altman, Shiri",Psychol Health Med,,60

305418,New insights on possible vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with stroke, particular characteristics of these patients are not fully understood. The adequate management of these patients depends on the comprehension of factors such as temporality, clinical presentation and etiology. We hypothesize there is a differential temporal relationship between COVID-19 severity and stroke onset. Methods: Considering PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review of the literature as of July 2020 was conducted and registered on PROSPERO. Pubmed and Scopus studies reporting patients with COVID-19 and stroke were included. Clinical, sociodemographic and laboratory characteristics of patients were extracted and analyzed. Results: Forty-seven studies and 176 patients were included, with a mean age of 63.1 years (SD= 16 n=122), most of them were males (63.2% n=171). The most frequent etiology was cryptogenic (40.9% n=66), and a mean National Institute of Health Stroke Scale of 14.4 points was found (SD= 8.6 n=73). Large vessel occlusion (LVO) was reported in 65.9% patients (n=91) and these patients were younger with greater stroke severity. D-dimer, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase were elevated in most patients with reported findings. Most patients had severe COVID-19. The mean time from onset of respiratory symptoms to stroke was 9 days (SD=9.9), a shorter time was noted in those with mild and moderate disease compared with the longest time in severe disease, this difference was statistically significant (p&lt; 0.001). Conclusions: There is a trend between the severity of COVID-19 and time to stroke onset, in which mild disease is associated with earlier stroke than severe disease. Age and stroke severity are related to the development of LVO. Inflammation and hypercoagulability markers are elevated in this disease, we propose to consider hypercoagulability secondary to COVID-19 as an underlying cause of stroke in these patients.","Valencia-Enciso, N.; Ortiz-Pereira, M.; Zafra-Sierra, M.

Coronaviruses are a large virus group of enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA. They are divided into four genera-alpha, beta, delta, and gamma-and alpha and beta coronaviruses are known to infect humans. Rapid and early diagnosis of COVID-19 is a challenging issue for physicians and other health care personnel.

313759,Interpretable detection of novel human viruses from genome sequencing data,2021,"Air pollution has happened to be one of the mounting alarms to be concerned with in many Indian cities. COVID-19 epidemic endow with a unique opportunity to report the degree of air quality improvement due to the nationwide lockdown in 10 most polluted cities across the country. National Air Quality Index (NAQI) based on continuous monitoring records of seven criteria pollutants (i.e. common air pollutants with known health impacts e.g. PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, SO2, NH3 and O3) for a total of 59 stations across the cities, satellite image derived Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and few statistical tools are employed to derive the outcomes. NAQI results convey that 8 cities out of the 10 air quality restored to good to satisfactory category during the lockdown period. Within week+1 of the lockdown period, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations have suppressed below the permissible limit in all cities. CO and NO2 have reduced to about -30% and -57% respectively during the lockdown period. Diurnal concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 have dropped drastically on the very 4th day of lockdown and become consistent with minor hourly vacillation. In April 2020 the AOD amount was reduced to about 36% and 18% in contrast to April 2018 and April 2019 respectively. This add-on reporting of the possible recovery extent in air quality may help to guide alternative policy intervention in form of short term lockdown so as to testify whether this type of unconventional policy decisions may be put forward to attain a green environment. Because, despite numerous restoration plans, air pollution levels have risen unabated in these cities. However, detailed inventory needs to be focused on identifying the localized pollution hotspots (i.e. source contribution).","Mahato, Susanta; Ghosh, Krishna Gopal",Environ Res,,60
319110,Targeting the SARS-CoV2 nucleocapsid protein for potential therapeutics using immuno-informatics and structure-based drug discovery techniques,2020,"Total 40 natural compounds were selected to perform the molecular docking studies to screen and identify the potent antiviral agents specifically for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The key targets of COVID-19, protease (PDB ID: 7BQY) and RNA polymerase (PDB ID: 7bV2) were used to dock our target compounds by Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) version 2014.09. We used 3 different conformations of protease target (6M0K, 6Y2F and 7BQY) and two different score functions to strengthen the probability of inhibitors discovery. After an extensive screening analysis, 20 compounds exhibit good binding affinities to one or both COVID-19 targets. 7 out of 20 compounds were predicted to overcome the activity of both targets. The top 7 hits are, flacourticin (3), sagerinic acid (16), hordatine A (23), hordatine B (24), N-feruloyl tyramine dimer (25), bisavenanthramides B-5 (29) and vulnibactins (40). According to our results, all these top hits was found to have a better binding scores than remdesivir, the native ligand in RNA polymerase target (PDB ID: 7bV2). Hordatines are phenolic compounds present in barley, were found to exhibit the highest binding affinity to both protease and polymerase through forming strong hydrogen bonds with the catalytic residues, as well as significant interactions with other receptor-binding residues. These results probably provided an excellent lead candidate for the development of therapeutic drugs against COVID-19. Eventually, animal experiment and accurate clinical trials are needed to confirm the preventive potentials of these compounds.","Dahab, Mohammed A; Hegazy, Mostafa M; Abbass, Hatem S",Nat Prod Bioprospect,,60

In mammals, body clocks are hierarchically organized, encompassing a so-called pacemaker clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), non-SCN brain and peripheral clocks, as well as cell-autonomous oscillators within virtually every cell type. A functional clock machinery on the molecular level, alignment among body clocks, as well as synchronization between endogenous circadian and exogenous environmental cycles has been shown to be crucial for our health and well-being. Yet, modern life constantly poses widespread challenges to our internal clocks, for example artificial lighting, shift work and trans-meridian travel, potentially leading to circadian disruption or misalignment and the emergence of associated diseases. For instance many of us experience a mismatch between sleep timing on work and free days (social jetlag) in our everyday lives without being aware of health consequences that may arise from such chronic circadian misalignment, Hence, this review provides an overview of the organization and molecular built-up of the mammalian circadian system, its interactions with the outside world, as well as pathologies arising from circadian disruption and misalignment.","Finger, Anna-Marie; Kramer, Achim",Acta Physiol (Oxf),,60

Interestingly, our approach to generating the malicious executables is not based on introducing a new packer but on the augmentation of the capabilities of an existing and widely used tool for packaging Python, PyInstaller but can be used for all similar packaging tools. As we prove, the problem is deeper and inherent in almost all antivirus engines and not PyInstaller specific. Second, our work exposes significant issues of well-known sandboxes that allow malware to evade their checks. As a result, we show that stealth and evasive malware can be efficiently developed, bypassing with ease state of the art malware detection tools without raising any alert.","Koutsokostas, Vasilios; Patsakis, Constantinos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00565v1.pdf,60

Such heterogeneity is thought to be dynamic, shifting over periods of minutes to hours in response to signaling inputs from the tumor microenvironment. However, models of this process have been inferred from indirect or post-hoc measurements of cell state, leaving the temporal details of signaling-driven heterogeneity undefined. Here, we developed a live-cell model system in which microenvironment-driven signaling dynamics can be directly observed and linked to variation in gene expression. Our analysis reveals that paracrine signaling between two cell types is sufficient to drive continual diversification of gene expression programs. This diversification emerges from systems-level properties of the EGFR-RAS-ERK signaling cascade, including intracellular amplification of amphiregulin-mediated paracrine signals and differential kinetic filtering by target genes including Fra-1, c-Myc, and Egr1. Our data enable more precise modeling of paracrine-driven transcriptional variation as a generator of gene expression heterogeneity.

METHODS: A survey was distributed to all 542 registered dentists in Nova Scotia, asking about dental care provision during 19-25 April 2020. Most answers were categorical, and descriptive analyses of these were performed. Data from the 1 open-ended question were analyzed using an inductive approach to identify themes. RESULTS: The response rate was 43% (n = 235). Most dentists (181) provided care but only 13 provided in-person care. From the open-ended question, 4 concerns emerged: communication from the regulatory authority;respondents' health and that of their staff;the health of and access to care for patients;and the future of their business. CONCLUSION: Most respondents remained engaged in non-in-person dental care using various modes. They expressed concerns about their health and that of their staff and patients as well as about the future of their practice. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Dentists and dental regulatory authorities should engage in discussions to promote the health of dental staff and patients and quality of care during the chronic phase of the pandemic.","Noushi, N.; Oladega, A.; Glogauer, M.; Chvartszaid, D.; Bedos, C.; Allison, P.",J Can Dent Assoc,,60

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most severe pSS complication worsening disease prognosis. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We summarized original articles published between April 2018 and May 2020 on this topic aiming to highlight novelties on lymphoma and lymphomagenesis. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Results have been grouped by epidemiology, etiopathogenesis and predictors of lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: NHL is the most severe complication of pSS and occurs in around 5-10% of patients. Over the last two years, several clinical, serological, and histopathological features have been proposed as predictive for lymphoma in pSS patients, allowing early diagnosis and consequently, better management and prognosis. Individual monitoring for disease activity and possible lymphoma development is a central clue in the evaluation of pSS patients.","Alunno, Alessia; Leone, Maria Comasia; Bartoloni, Elena; Gerli, Roberto; Carubbi, Francesco",Panminerva med,,60

The objective of the present study was to generate reliable information on the oxalate content and antioxidant activity in different foods and classify them by very low, low, medium, high and very high oxalate content and antioxidant activity. METHODS: The oxalate content of 109 foods including ethnic foods was assessed by an enzymatic assay, and the antioxidant activity was measured by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity to determine the oxalate/antioxidant activity ratio. Oxalate consumption was then evaluated in 400 subjects with overweight and obesity using 24-h dietary recalls. RESULTS: The main foods with high oxalate content were raw spinach, huanzontle, purslane, chard, almond, and toasted and sweetened roasted amaranth. The highest antioxidant activity was found in strawberries, all types of chocolates, roselle, morita peppers, and pinolillo. Subjects with overweight or obesity exceed the dietary oxalate daily intake recommendation. CONCLUSIONS: The classification of foods by their oxalate content and antioxidant activity will be very useful to generate nutritional recommendation in different diseases, mainly UL.","Avila-Nava, Azalia; Medina-Vera, Isabel; Rodríguez-Hernández, Pamela; Guevara-Cruz, Martha; Heredia-G Canton, Pamela K; Tovar, Armando R; Torres, Nimbe",J. renal nutr,,60

Genetic factors implicated in the host antiviral response provide for novel insights into its pathogenesis. We performed an in-depth genetic analysis of chromosome 21 exploiting the genome-wide association study data, including 6,406 individuals hospitalized for COVID-19 and 902,088 controls with European genetic ancestry from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. We found that five single nucleotide polymorphisms within TMPRSS2 and near MX1 gene show associations with severe COVID-19. The minor alleles of the five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) correlated with a reduced risk of developing severe COVID-19 and high level of MX1 expression in blood. Our findings demonstrate that host genetic factors can influence the different clinical presentations of COVID-19 and that MX1 could be a potential therapeutic target.","Andolfo, Immacolata; Russo, Roberta; Lasorsa, Vito Alessandro; Cantalupo, Sueva; Rosato, Barbara Eleni; Bonfiglio, Ferdinando; Frisso, Giulia; Abete, Pasquale; Cassese, Gian Marco; Servillo, Giuseppe; Esposito, Gabriella; Gentile, Ivan; Piscopo, Carmelo; Villani, Romolo; Fiorentino, Giuseppe; Cerino, Pellegrino; Buonerba, Carlo; Pierri, Biancamaria; Zollo, Massimo; Iolascon, Achille; Capasso, Mario",iScience,,60

This cross-sectional study assessed the preparedness and perception of infection control measures against the COVID-19 pandemic by dentists in Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This online survey addressed the impact and perception of the COVID-19 pandemic on dental practice in Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire comprised 26 closed-ended questions. Descriptive statistics included frequency distributions with percentages. In addition, the significance between the different demographic variables and questions about dentists' perception of the COVID-19 pandemic was tested using the Chi-square test. RESULTS: COVID-19 management in dental clinics varied in terms of adherence to the Ministry of Health (MOH) guidelines. Dental clinics' screening questionnaire for patients showed good adherence (67%), while the lowest agreement was detected with the question on the existence of an airborne infection in the isolation room (15%). Almost two-thirds of the respondents agreed that the dental reception area adopted the proper COVID-19 preventive measures. Greatest accord was observed in their answers on questions about dentists' perception of the COVID-19 pandemic, ranging from 64%-89%. In addition, there were statistically significant differences in questions about the perception of dentists towards the COVID-19 pandemic by different demographic variables such as age and years of work experience (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The response of most dentists regarding the preparedness and perception of infection control measures against the COVID-19 pandemic was positive. Dental clinics need to adhere more to the MOH recommendations in preparedness of their facilities or by educating their dentists and staff.","Al-Khalifa, Khalifa S; AlSheikh, Rasha; Al-Swuailem, Abdullah S; Alkhalifa, Muneera S; Al-Johani, Mahmoud H; Al-Moumen, Saud A; Almomen, Zainab I",PLoS One,,60

In this study, two assays that are correlated with NAbs were compared: the haemagglutination test (HAT) and the surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). METHODS: The specificity of the HAT was compared with the sVNT, and the sensitivity and persistence of antibodies in patients with varying severity of illness was assessed in a cohort of 71 patients at 4-6 weeks and 13-16 weeks. The kinetics were assessed in the first, second, and third weeks in patients with varying severity of acute illness. RESULTS: The specificity of the HAT was >99%, and sensitivity was similar to the sVNT. The levels of HAT were significantly and positively correlated with those of the sVNT (Spearman's r = 0.78, P < 0.0001). Patients with moderate and severe illness had higher HAT titres when compared to those with mild illness. Six of seven patients with severe illness had a titre of >1:640 during the second week of illness, whereas only five of 31 patients with a mild illness had a titre of >1:160 in the second week of illness.

According to the knowledge of infectious diseases such as SARS and MERS, many patients and health care workers suffered from depression and anxiety during and after the epidemic. In particular, post-epidemic survivors were more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Similar conditions could be occurred during and after COVID-19. Therefore, it is also an important task to reduce the prevalence of PTSD after COVID-19 as much as possible and to relieve the tension of infected patients, first-line medical staff, quarantine personnel and so on. Traditional Chinese medicine has unique advantages in the treatment of emotional diseases. Understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of PTSD by theory of traditional Chinese medicine and looking for effective methods to treat PTSD will be helpful to treat PTSD of survivors after COVID-19. It is found that Sini Powder has potential value in the treatment of PTSD by the summary and comparison of the research on traditional Chinese medicine related to the treatment of PTSD.

This article aims to discuss the pharmacotherapeutic considerations for the management of diabetes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. AREAS COVERED: We discussed various aspects of pharmacotherapeutic management in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: (i) susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 among individuals with diabetes, (ii) glycemic goals for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and concurrent diabetes, (iii) pharmacological treatment considerations for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and concurrent diabetes. EXPERT OPINION: The glycemic goals in patients with COVID-19 and concurrent type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are to avoid disruption of stable metabolic state, maintain optimal glycemic control, and prevent adverse glycemic events. Patients with T1DM require insulin therapy at all times to prevent ketosis. The management strategies for patients with T2DM include temporary discontinuation of certain oral antidiabetic agents and consideration for insulin therapy. Patients with T2DM who are relatively stable and able to eat regularly may continue with oral antidiabetic agents if glycemic control is satisfactory. Hyperglycemia may develop in patients with systemic corticosteroid treatment and should be managed upon accordingly.","Hasan, Syed Shahzad; Kow, Chia Siang; Bain, Amie; Kavanagh, Sallianne; Merchant, Hamid A; Hadi, Muhammad Abdul",Expert Opin Pharmacother,,60

Obesity, also known as the pandemic of the 21st century, has been evolving as an adverse prognostic marker. Obesity is associated with a higher risk of being SARS-CoV-2-positive (46%), as well as hospitalization (113%) and death (48%) due to COVID-19. It is especially true for subjects with morbid obesity. Also, observational studies suggest that in the case of COVID-19, no favorable ""obesity paradox"" is observed. Therefore, it is postulated to introduce a new entity, i.e., coronavirus disease-related cardiometabolic syndrome (CIRCS). In theory, it applies to all stages of COVID-19, i.e., prevention, acute proceedings (from COVID-19 diagnosis to resolution or three months), and long-term outcomes. Consequently, lifestyle changes, glycemic control, and regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway have crucial implications for preventing and managing subjects with COVID-19. Finally, it is crucial to use cardioprotective drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers and statins. Nevertheless, there is the need to conduct prospective studies and registries better to evaluate the issue of obesity in COVID-19 patients.","Bil, Jacek; Mozenska, Olga",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,,60

The rapid growth of IoT technology has revolutionized human life by inaugurating the concept of smart devices, smart healthcare, smart industry, smart city, smart grid, among others. IoT devices' security has become a serious concern nowadays, especially for the healthcare domain, where recent attacks exposed damaging IoT security vulnerabilities. Traditional network security solutions are well established. However, due to the resource constraint property of IoT devices and the distinct behavior of IoT protocols, the existing security mechanisms cannot be deployed directly for securing the IoT devices and network from the cyber-attacks. To enhance the level of security for IoT, researchers need IoT-specific tools, methods, and datasets. To address the mentioned problem, we provide a framework for developing IoT context-aware security solutions to detect malicious traffic in IoT use cases. The proposed framework consists of a newly created, open-source IoT data generator tool named IoT-Flock. The IoT-Flock tool allows researchers to develop an IoT use-case comprised of both normal and malicious IoT devices and generate traffic. Additionally, the proposed framework provides an open-source utility for converting the captured traffic generated by IoT-Flock into an IoT dataset. Using the proposed framework in this research, we first generated an IoT healthcare dataset which comprises both normal and IoT attack traffic. Afterwards, we applied different machine learning techniques to the generated dataset to detect the cyber-attacks and protect the healthcare system from cyber-attacks. The proposed framework will help in developing the context-aware IoT security solutions, especially for a sensitive use case like IoT healthcare environment.","Hussain, Faisal; Abbas, Syed Ghazanfar; Shah, Ghalib A; Pires, Ivan Miguel; Fayyaz, Ubaid U; Shahzad, Farrukh; Garcia, Nuno M; Zdravevski, Eftim",Sensors (Basel),,60

Periodic health monitoring, active case finding and early care for symptomatic patients contributed to positive post-infection outcomes. Such measures must be considered essential for the surveillance of COVID-19 in environments with limited capacity to promote social distance, such as penitentiary institutions.","Gouvea-Reis, Fernando A; Borja, Lairton S; Dias, Patrícia O; Silva, Danniely C S; Percio, Jadher; Peterka, Cássio; Silva, Guilherme O; Adjuto, Raphael N P; Tavares, Glaucia B; Cunha, Mayana B; Feres, Claudia; de Oliveira, Janaína; Sodré, Giselle; Dos Santos, Wallace; de Moraes, Camile",Int. j. infect. dis,,60
430799,Anti-Frameshifting Ligand Active against SARS Coronavirus-2 is Resistant to Natural Mutations of the Frameshift-Stimulatory Pseudoknot,2021,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammation in the lungs that causes obstruction in the airway, poor airflow, and irreversible loss of lung function. In clinical practice, comprehensive care for COPD patients includes the diagnosis using spirometry, clinical examination and comprehensive pharmacological and non-pharmacological management. The diagnosis is based on symptoms, dyspnea and lung function impairment and can be mild to very severe. Symptoms are examined using the COPD assessment test (CAT) score, and dyspnea grade are examined using a modified MRC from GOLD guidelines. When mild, the care includes self-management education, smoking cessation, lifestyle modifications, vaccination, and short-acting bronchodilators. Self-management education involves inhaler device training, breathing technique, early recognition of acute exacerbations and writing action plans. As the disease progresses, other care measures are added. These measures include the addition of long-acting inhaler therapies, pulmonary rehabilitation, oral therapies, oxygen and lung transplantation. During the final stages of COPD, patients receive end-of-life care (Bourbeau et al., 2019).1 The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is spread through respiratory droplets. This infectious disease has led to a pandemic and is affecting the lives of many around the world, including Canadians. During this pandemic, the non-essential health services, including caring for patients with COPD, have been put on hold to reduce the risk of spread. Other implications of this pandemic for COPD patients include the health risk in case of infection. A meta-analysis including studies from January to March 2020 in Wuhan showed that pre-existing COPD worsens the risk of COVID-19 progression and leads to poorer prognostics. The sub-group analysis showed a significantly higher risk of ICU requirements and death in COPD patients who are infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Studies suggest strong efforts to mitigate the risk of infection in this population (Zhao et al., May 2020).2 This makes caring for this population even more critical during the pandemic.","Elbeddini, Ali; Tayefehchamani, Yasamin",Res. soc. adm. pharm,,60

Given the high complexity many issues have to be taken into account. Simplification is urgently warranted not to loose focus of the important things to be done. Methods: To look at phase 3 from the endpoint—in this case hospital admission—should facilitate the focus on key variables upstream. Based on a simplified model of approximated and plausible parameters for the overall attack rate (AR), the AR(hospitalization) and the AR(ICU admission), the resources needed are compared with the available resources i.e. number of beds available in general and beds in ICU in particular. The calculations are carried out population-based for Ploen County as well as regionally together with the Kiel metropolitan area. Results: Since the ARs in the up do date available cohorts are overestimated, considerably lower AR(hospitalization) and AR(ICU) should be expected. An AR(hospitalization) of 10% could not be materialized in Ploen County; one with 5% could. In the regional analysis together with the University Hospital Kiel (UKSH) an AR(hospitalization) of up to 10% is feasible, as also an AR(ICU) of 3%. The kinetics of hospital admissions is, however, dependent from countermeasures in public health as well as admission habits of the family physicians. The available number of beds is determined by beds made available and by the mean duration of hospitalization. The latter depends from the age and underlying conditions of the patients. Conclusions: System failure has to be averted by clarity in regard to the key parameters and their independent variables. The regional management is crucial and should be coordinated by a so-called bed-coordinator. Close cooperation allover the health care system is needed in alliance with the local health departments.","Weigl, Josef",Pravent. Gesundheitsforderung,,60

OBJECTIVES: Investigate the relationship between ACE I/D polymorphism and the clinical severity of COVID-19. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included COVID-19 patients with asymptomatic, mild, and severe disease with clinical data and whole blood samples collected from 1 April 2020 to 1 July 2020. ACE I/D genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction and agarose gel electrophoresis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: ACE DD, DI and II genotypes frequencies. SAMPLE SIZE: 90 cases, 30 in each disease severity group. RESULTS: Age and the frequency of general comorbidity increased significantly from the asymptomatic disease group to the severe disease group. Advanced age, diabetes mellitus and presence of ischemic heart disease were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19 [OR and 95 % CI: 1.052 (1.021-1.083), 5.204 (1.006-26.892) and 5.922 (1.109-31.633), respectively]. The ACE II genotype was the dominant genotype (50%) in asymptomatic patients, while the DD genotype was the dominant genotype (63.3 %) in severe disease. The ACE II geno-type was protective against severe COVID-19 [OR and 95% CI: .323 (.112-.929)]. All nine patients (8.9%) who died had severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical severity of COVID-19 infection may be associated with the ACE I/D polymorphism. LIMITATIONS: Small sample size and single center.

Less focus has been placed on more localized contexts, such as carceral settings, where racial and ethnic inequities in COVID-19 health outcomes also exist, but the proximal drivers of inequality are different. In this study, we analyzed mortality rates among incarcerated people in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) to assess racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 mortality. We obtained monthly demographic and mortality information of the TDCJ population from April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2021 from TDCJ monthly reports and open record requests filed by the Texas Justice Initiative. We estimated the risk of COVID-19 mortality for the Hispanic and Black population relative to the White population using a Bayesian regression framework, adjusting for sex and age. In the first 12 months of the pandemic, Hispanic and Black all-cause mortality rates were higher than that of the White population, reversing the pattern observed the 12 months prior. Adjusted risk of COVID-19 mortality relative to the White population was 1.96 (CI 1.32-2.93) for the Hispanic population and 1.66 (CI 1.10-2.52) for the Black population. We find that COVID-19 mortality has disproportionately impacted Hispanic and Black individuals within the TDCJ population. As the proximal mechanisms which drive these inequalities are likely different than those which lead to racial inequalities in the non-incarcerated populations, future studies should look to assess and address the specific drivers of COVID-19 related disparities in carceral settings.","Marquez, Neal; Moreno, Destiny; Klonsky, Amanda; Dolovich, Sharon",,,60

An understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns and influencing factors of the COVID-19 epidemic on multiple scales could benefit the control of the outbreak. Therefore, we used spatial autocorrelation and Spearman's rank correlation methods to investigate these two topics, respectively. The COVID-19 epidemic data reported publicly and relevant open data in Hubei province were analyzed. The results showed that (1) at both prefecture and county levels, the global spatial autocorrelation was extremely significant for the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases (CCC) in Hubei province from 30 January to 18 February 2020. Further, (2) at both levels, the significant hotspot and cluster/outlier area was observed solely in Wuhan city and most of its districts/sub-cities from 30 January to 18 February 2020. (3) At the prefecture level in Hubei province, the number of CCC had a positive and extremely significant correlation (p < 0.01) with the registered population (RGP), resident population (RSP), Baidu migration index (BMI), regional gross domestic production (GDP), and total retail sales of consumer goods (TRS), respectively, from 29 January to 18 February 2020 and had a negative and significant correlation (p < 0.05) with minimum elevation (MINE) from 2 February to 18 February 2020, but no association with the land area (LA), population density (PD), maximum elevation (MAXE), mean elevation (MNE), and range of elevation (RAE) from 23 January to 18 February 2020. (4) At the county level, the number of CCC in Hubei province had a positive and extremely significant correlation (p < 0.01) with PD, RGP, RSP, GDP, and TRS, respectively, from 27 January to 18 February 2020, and was negatively associated with MINE, MAXE, MNE, and RAE, respectively, from 26 January to 18 February 2020, and negatively associated with LA from 30 January to 18 February 2020. It suggested that (1) the COVID-19 epidemic at both levels in Hubei province had evident characteristics of significant global spatial autocorrelations and significant centralized high-risk outbreaks, and had an extremely significant association with social and economic factors. (2) The COVID-19 epidemics were significantly associated with the natural factors, such as LA, MAXE, MNE, and RAE, -only at the county level, not at the prefecture level, from 2 February to 18 February 2020. (3) The COVID-19 epidemics were significantly related to the socioeconomic factors, such as RGP, RSP, TRS, and GDP, at both levels from 26 January to 18 February 2020.

Applying insights from the information processing view of organisation design theory to original survey data, we investigate how firms configure boundary-spanning government affairs (GA) activities in response to Brexit. Contrary to conventional organisation design thinking, we find the ability of GA units to monitor and influence Brexit-related developments improves when firms concentrate GA decision-making at clearly defined organisational levels, and coordinate GA units with the rest of the business.

476756,Insights into aphid prey consumption by ladybirds: Optimising field sampling methods and primer design for high throughput sequencing,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease was first discovered in China in December, 2019. The disease quickly spread globally, with the first US case identified in January, 2020; it was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Soon after, anecdotal reports indicated that many US hospitals and healthcare facilities were running low on personal protective equipment (PPE) and supplies. METHODS: An online survey was administered to all Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology members in March, 2020 to assess access to PPE, hand hygiene products, and disinfection supplies. RESULTS: In all, 1,201 infection preventionists participated. Participants reported running a bit low to almost being out of all PPE types. More had sufficient gloves (63.4%) compared to all other PPE types (P < .001 for all). Face shields and N95 respirators were the least available (13.6% and 18.2% had sufficient supplies, respectively; p < .001 for all). Many (66.9%) had sufficient hand soap, but far fewer had sufficient hand sanitizer (29.5%, X2â¯=â¯211.1, P < .001). Less than half (45.4%, nâ¯=â¯545) had sufficient disinfection supplies. CONCLUSIONS: Many US healthcare facilities had very low amounts of PPE, hand hygiene products, and disinfection supplies early on during the pandemic. A lack of these supplies can lead to occupational exposures and illness as well as healthcare-associated transmission of COVID-19 and other diseases.","Rebmann, Terri; Vassallo, Angela; Holdsworth, Jill E",Am. j. infect. control,,60

486698,Inhibition of coronavirus infection by a synthetic STING agonist in primary human airway system,2021,"Community responses to the SARS-CoV-2, or ""coronavirus"" outbreaks of 2020 reveal a great deal about society. In the absence of government mandates, debates over issues such as mask mandates and social distancing activated conflicting moral beliefs, dividing communities. Policy scholars argue that such controversies represent fundamental frame conflicts, which arise from incommensurable worldviews, such as contested notions of ""liberty"" versus ""equity"". This article investigates frames people constructed to make sense of coronavirus and how this affected social behavior in 2020. We conducted an interpretive framing analysis using ethnographic data from a predominately white, conservative, and rural midwestern tourist town in the United States from June to August 2020. We collected semi-structured interviews with 87 community members, observed meetings, events, and daily life. We identified four frames that individuals constructed to make sense of coronavirus: Concern, Crisis, Constraint, and Conspiracy. Concern frames illustrated how some individuals are uniquely affected and thus protect themselves. Crisis frames recognized coronavirus as a pervasive and profound threat requiring unprecedented action. Constraint frames emphasized the coronavirus response as a threat to financial stability and personal growth that should be resisted. Conspiracy frames denied its biological basis and did not compel action. These four conflicting frames demonstrate how social fragmentation, based on conflicting values, led to an incomplete pandemic response in the absence of government mandates at the national, state, and local levels in rural America. These findings provide a social rationale for public health mandates, such as masking, school/business closures, and social distancing, when contested beliefs impede collective action.","Koon, Adam D; Mendenhall, Emily; Eich, Lori; Adams, Abby; Borus, Zach A",Soc Sci Med,,60

489316,Nanoscale imaging and mechanical analysis of viral infection on cells by atomic force microscopy,2020,"The COVID-19 global health pandemic has led some 75 countries to restrict their exports of hundreds of products, ranging from antibiotics to cotton face masks and medical ventilators. The cost of these measures, which lead to global shortages, will be counted in human lives. Yet the multilateral trade regime lacks effective legal disciplines on export restrictions. In response, scholars have pinned their hopes on the prospect of potential retaliation working as a deterrent. Are such hopes warranted? Early evidence suggests not: the threat of retaliation cannot effectively deter most export controls, because the most flagrant country users are also shielded by the very characteristics that render them prone to imposing export restraints in the first place. The empirical evidence indicates the prospect of retaliation has played no role in the decision to restrict exports by the world’s biggest exporters of essential medical goods. Yet autarky is unlikely to be a workable solution to assure domestic supply. I suggest that attempts at limiting market consolidation of essential goods may be one way of reducing the incentive to implement export controls in the first place.","Pelc, Krzysztof",Can. J. Polit.

This study investigated the phenotypic and genotypic diversity of the nodule-forming rhizobial bacteria recovered from Pisum sativum subsp., Cicer pinnatifidum, and Lens culinaris subsp. orientalis exhibiting natural distribution in the Gaziantep province of Turkey. PCA analyses of rhizobial isolates, which were tested to be highly resistant to stress conditions, showed that especially pH and salt concentrations had an important effect on these bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA determined that these wild species were nodulated by at least 7 groups including Rhizobium and non-Rhizobium. The largest group comprised of Rhizobium leguminosarum and Rhizobium sp. while R. pusense, which was previously determined as non-symbiotic species, was found to nodulate C. pinnatifidum and L. culinaris subsp. orientalis. In recent studies, Klebsiella sp., which is stated to be able to nodulate different species, strong evidences have been obtained in present study exhibiting that Klebsiella sp. can nodulate C. pinnatifidum and Pseudomonas sp. was able to nodulate C. pinnatifidum and P. sativum subsp. Additionally, L. culinaris subsp. orientalis unlike other plant species, was nodulated by Burkholderia sp. and Serratia sp. associated isolates. Some isolates could not be characterized at the species level since the 16S rRNA sequence similarity rate was low and the fact that they were in a separate group supported with high bootstrap values in the phylogenetic tree may indicate that these isolates could be new species. The REP-PCR fingerprinting provided results supporting the existence of new species nodulating wild ancestors.","Basbuga, Sevil; Basbuga, Selcuk; Yayla, Fatih; Mahmoud, Ahmed M; Can, Canan",Int. microbiol,,60

500104,Is SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein impairing macrophage function via α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors?,2021,"Background: With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need arose to maintain treatment continuity for religious Jewish Ultra-Orthodox young women with eating disorders (EDs) previously hospitalized in the ED department at the Ultra-Orthodox ""Mayanei Hayeshua"" medical center in Israel. This need led to the development of home-based online treatment channels, previously unfamiliar, and unaccepted in this population. The implementation of this model had to take into consideration many of the difficulties inherent in the use of online treatment in Jewish Ultra-Orthodox mental health patients. Aims: We sought to investigate our online home-based treatment model implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic in previously hospitalized young Ultra-Orthodox women with EDs. Method: We briefly review the literature on: (1) The Jewish Israeli Ultra-Orthodox culture;(2) Young women in Ultra-Orthodox society;and (3) EDs in Jewish Israeli Ultra-Orthodox women. We then present the inpatient ED department for Ultra-Orthodox young women and describe the online treatment model adapted to this population during the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlight the difficulties, dilemmas, and advantages of our online model with the description of three patients. Findings: Online therapy can serve as a barrier to treatment in some cases, due to physical (lack of suitable online devices except phones), familial (over-crowded families), and religious circumstances, as well as because of the patients' reluctance to take part in this treatment. In other cases, virtual home-based treatment can lead to a positive change. This may be the case in patients who find the distancing online model suitable for them, and in parents who are committed to treatment, using their greater physical and emotional presence at home during the COVID-19 pandemic for the good if their ill-daughters. Discussion: This paper highlights the difficulties and possibilities inherent in a virtual home-based treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic for Ultra-Orthodox young women previously hospitalized because of an ED. This model can be effective for some patients and families if undertaken by a multidisciplinary team that is not only knowledgeable about the treatment of EDs and the use of online strategies but also knowledgeable and culturally sensitive to the specific needs and codes of Ultra-Orthodox populations.","Latzer, Y.; Herman, E.; Ashkenazi, R.; Atias, O.; Laufer, S.; Biran Ovadia, A.; Oppenheim, T.; Shimoni, M.; Uziel, M.; Stein, D.",Frontiers in psychiatry Frontiers Research Foundation,,60

Like other teaching faculties, we needed to quickly adapt the course material to an online platform. However, for psychiatric teaching, it was also essential to find alternatives to patient interviewing, and to provide support and containment in uncertain times. We aim to describe our philosophical stance and framework for the delivery of our online course. CONCLUSIONS: Key components in the delivery of our modified course were the transition to online learning and assessment, developing a suite of surrogate clinical learning experiences, using simulated patients for online interviewing, and attention to student well-being whilst providing a supportive and contained environment for student learning. Supportive leadership and good communication assisted the teaching staff to deliver the course during COVID-19.","Khoo, Taraneh; Warren, Nicola; Jenkins, Anna; Turner, Jane",Australas Psychiatry,,60

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente integrated healthcare delivery systems serving populations in northern California, southern California, and Washington state. PARTICIPANTS: 1840 people with a first acute hospital admission for confirmed covid-19 by 22 April 2020, among 9 596 321 healthcare plan enrollees. Analyses of hospital length of stay and clinical outcomes included 1328 people admitted by 9 April 2020 (534 in northern California, 711 in southern California, and 83 in Washington). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative incidence of first acute hospital admission for confirmed covid-19, and subsequent probabilities of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality, as well as duration of hospital stay and ICU stay. The effective reproduction number (RE ) describing transmission dynamics was estimated for each region. RESULTS: As of 22 April 2020, cumulative incidences of a first acute hospital admission for covid-19 were 15.6 per 100 000 cohort members in northern California, 23.3 per 100 000 in southern California, and 14.7 per 100 000 in Washington. Accounting for censoring of incomplete hospital stays among those admitted by 9 April 2020, the estimated median duration of stay among survivors was 9.3 days (with 95% staying 0.8 to 32.9 days) and among non-survivors was 12.7 days (1.6 to 37.7 days). The censoring adjusted probability of ICU admission for male patients was 48.5% (95% confidence interval 41.8% to 56.3%) and for female patients was 32.0% (26.6% to 38.4%). For patients requiring critical care, the median duration of ICU stay was 10.6 days (with 95% staying 1.3 to 30.8 days). The censoring adjusted case fatality ratio was 23.5% (95% confidence interval 19.6% to 28.2%) among male inpatients and 14.9% (11.8% to 18.6%) among female inpatients; mortality risk increased with age for both male and female patients. Reductions in RE were identified over the study period within each region. CONCLUSIONS: Among residents of California and Washington state enrolled in Kaiser Permanente healthcare plans who were admitted to hospital with covid-19, the probabilities of ICU admission, of long hospital stay, and of mortality were identified to be high. Incidence rates of new hospital admissions have stabilized or declined in conjunction with implementation of social distancing interventions.","Lewnard, Joseph A; Liu, Vincent X; Jackson, Michael L; Schmidt, Mark A; Jewell, Britta L; Flores, Jean P; Jentz, Chris; Northrup, Graham R; Mahmud, Ayesha; Reingold, Arthur L; Petersen, Maya; Jewell, Nicholas P; Young, Scott; Bellows, Jim",BMJ,,60

METHODS: After systematically searching PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 retrospective, 6 prospective observational, and 2 cross-sectional studies was performed according to the guidelines of the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) statement. RESULTS: Overall, 4382 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included. Men accounted for significantly more patients than did women (odds ratio [OR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-2.02; P < .001). The total incidence of VTE among the patients with COVID-19 was 28.3% (95% CI, 21.6%-35.4%), with an incidence of 38.0% (95% CI, 29.1%-47.4%) and 17.2% (95% CI, 11.4%-23.8%) among those with severe and general COVID-19, respectively. The total incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities was 18.3% (95% CI, 10.8%-27.2%). The incidence of DVT was 22.1% (95% CI, 11.0%-35.5%) and 12.8% (95% CI, 5.0%-23.3%) in those with severe and general COVID-19, respectively. The total incidence of pulmonary embolism was 17.6% (95% CI, 12.3%-23.5%), with a rate of 21.7% (95% CI, 14.8%-29.3%) in severe cases and 12.5% (95% CI, 6.1%-23.5%) in general cases. When COVID-19 severity was unclassified, the mortality for the patients with VTE was not significantly greater (25.2%; 95% CI, 12.2%-40.5%) than that for those without VTE (10.2%; 95% CI, 3.4%-19.5%; OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.46-7.64; P = .377). However, among the patients with severe COVID-19, those who had developed VTE had significantly greater mortality compared with those without VTE (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.15-3.53; P = .014). The patients with COVID-19 and VTE had significantly higher D-dimer levels than did similar patients without VTE in multiple studies. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of VTE, DVT, and pulmonary embolism has been substantial among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, especially among those with severe COVID-19. Patients with severe COVID-19 and VTE had significantly greater mortality compared with similar patients without VTE. An increased D-dimer level might be an indicator of the occurrence of VTE in patients with COVID-19.","Liu, Yandong; Cai, Jiawei; Wang, Chao; Jin, Jie; Qu, Lefeng",J. Vasc. Surg. Venous Lymphat.

590468,Receptor-Induced Thiolate Couples Env Activation to Retrovirus Fusion and Infection,2007-12-21,"Resistance to infection is the ability of the host to evoke a strong immune response sufficient to eliminate the infectious agent. In contrast, maternal tolerance to the fetus necessitates careful regulation of immune responses. Successful pregnancy requires the maternal host to effectively balance the opposing processes of maternal immune reactivity and tolerance to the fetus. However, this balance can be perturbed by infections which are recognized as the major cause of adverse pregnancy outcome including pre-term labor. Select pathogens also pose a serious threat of severe maternal illness. These include intracellular and chronic pathogens that have evolved immune evasive strategies. Murine models of intracellular bacteria and parasites that mimic pathogenesis of infection in humans have been developed. While human epidemiological studies provide insight into maternal immunity to infection, experimental infection in pregnant mice is a vital tool to unravel the complex molecular mechanisms of placental infection, congenital transmission and maternal illness.

However, it is not clear whether such relationships could be mitigated according to the physical activity level. AIM: To describe, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the relationship between depression and musculoskeletal pain according to the physical activity levels. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: This research was conducted in Brazil between May 5 and March 17, 2020. Participants (N = 1872; 58% women) were invited through social media to answer a structured online questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were assessed through self-report of perception of depression during quarantine. Musculoskeletal pain was assessed based on the Nordic questionnaire identifying nine possible pain points in the body. Physical activity was assessed based on the weekly frequency, intensity, and duration of each session of physical activity the participants engaged in during COVID-19. The logistic binary regression analyzed the associations between depressive symptoms and musculoskeletal pain according to the participants' level of physical activity. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms were associated with pain in six different regions of the body in physically inactive participants. In physically inactive participants, those with depressive symptoms 1.51 (95% CI = 1.04-2.19) and 2.78 (95% CI = 1.81-4.26) times more likely to have pain in one or two and ≥three regions body regions, respectively.

It can be divided into two main forms by the types of onsets, namely, chronic to subacute type showing nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) or NSIP with an organizing pneumonia (OP)/fibrosing OP (FOP) pattern and acute type showing acute lung injury (ALI) to diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) pattern. Anti-aminoacyl tRNA Synthetase antibody-positive cases mainly show an NSIP or FOP pattern, whereas anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 antibody-positive cases show ALI to DAD pattern. Bilateral consolidation with or without ground-glass opacification with lower lobe predominance is common as a major pattern in all types, but the distribution or extent is sometimes different. The early detection of findings that indicate a rapid progressive course is vital. Diffuse cranio-caudal distribution and multiple ground-glass opacifications with random distribution might indicate a poorer prognosis.","Egashira, Ryoko",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34356972/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57070692,60

Four antigenic sites have been defined (A, B, C, and D). The sites involved in the neutralization of TGEV are: A, D, and B, sites A and D being antigenically dominant for TGEV neutralization in vitro. These two sites have specific properties of interest: site A is highly conserved and is present in coronaviruses of three animal species, and site D can be represented by synthetic peptides. Both sites might be relevant in protection in vivo. PRCV does not have sites B and C, due to a genomic deletion. Complex antigenic sites, i.e., conformation and glycosylation dependent sites, have been represented by simple mimotopes selected from a library expressing recombinant peptides with random sequences, or by anti-idiotypic internal image monoclonal antibodies. An epidemiological tree relating the TGEVs and PRCVs has been proposed. The estimated mutation fixation rate of 7 ± 2 × 10−4 substitutions per nucleotide and year indicates that TGEV related coronaviruses show similar variability to other RNA viruses. In order to induce secretory immunity, different segments of the S gene have been expressed using avirulent forms of Salmonella typhimurium and adenovirus. These vectors, with a tropism for Peyer's patches may be ideal candidates in protection against TGEV.","Enjuanes, Luis; Suñé, Carlos; Gebauer, Fátima; Smerdou, Cristian; Camacho, Ana; Antón, Inés M.; González, Silvia; Talamillo, Ana; Méndez, Ana; Ballesteros, María L.; Sánchez, Carlos",Veterinary Microbiology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037811359290053V; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/037811359290053V; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1282756/,60

Health information systems (HIS) support the collection and use of health related data. However, HIS focus on reporting and are unfit to support decisions. Since data tools are paper-based in most primary healthcare settings, we have produced an innovative Paper-based Health Information System in Comprehensive Care (PHISICC) using a human-centred design approach. We are carrying out a cluster randomised controlled trial in three African countries to assess the effects of PHISICC compared with the current systems. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Study areas are in rural zones of Côte d’Ivoire, Mozambique and Nigeria. Seventy health facilities in each country have been randomly allocated to using PHISICC tools or to continuing to use the regular HIS tools. We have randomly selected households in the catchment areas of each health facility to collect outcomes’ data (household surveys have been carried out in two of the three countries and the end-line data collection is planned for mid-2021). Primary outcomes include data quality and use, coverage of health services and health workers satisfaction; secondary outcomes are additional data quality and use parameters, childhood mortality and additional health workers and clients experience with the system. Just prior to the implementation of the trial, we had to relocate the study site in Mozambique due to unforeseen logistical issues. The effects of the intervention will be estimated using regression models and accounting for clustering using random effects. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics committees in Côte d’Ivoire, Mozambique and Nigeria approved the trials. We plan to disseminate our findings, data and research materials among researchers and policy-makers. We aim at having our findings included in systematic reviews on health systems interventions and future guidance development on HIS.

In computer science, this represents a typical problem of machine learning over incomplete or limited data in early epidemic Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC) simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction of fuzzy rule induction techniques. As a result, decision makers are benefited from a better fitted MC outputs complemented by min–max rules that foretell about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.","Fong, Simon James; Li, Gloria; Dey, Nilanjan; Crespo, Rubén González; Herrera-Viedma, Enrique",Appl Soft Comput,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106282; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494620302222?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362799/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568494620302222,60

We aimed to understand the potential impact of health and demographic factors on the infection and mortality rates of COVID-19 at the population level. Methods We collected total number of confirmed cases and deaths related to COVID-19 at the county level in the US from January 21, 2020 to April 23, 2020. We extracted health and demographic measures for each US county. Multivariable linear mixed effects models were used to investigate potential correlations of health and demographic characteristics with the infection and mortality rates of COVID-19 in US counties. Results Our models showed that several health and demographic factors were positively correlated with the infection rate of COVID-19, such as low education level and percentage of Black. In contrast, several factors, including percentage of smokers and percentage of food insecure, were negatively correlated with the infection rate of COVID-19. While the number of days since first confirmed case and the infection rate of COVID-19 were negatively correlated with the mortality rate of COVID-19, percentage of elders (65 and above) and percentage of rural were positively correlated with the mortality rate of COVID-19.

594623,Thermal Image Scanning for the Early Detection of Fever Induced by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus Infection in Chickens and Ducks and Its Application in Farms,2021-05-25,"BACKGROUND: The functional state of glial cells, like astrocytes and microglia, critically modulates the course of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases and can have both detrimental and beneficial effects. Glial cell function is tightly controlled by cellular interactions in which cytokines are important messengers. Recent studies provide evidence that in particular chemokines are important modulators of glial cell function. During the course of CNS diseases like multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s disease, and in the corresponding animal models, the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 are abundantly expressed at sites of glial activation, arguing for an important role of these chemokines and their corresponding receptor CXCR3 in glial activation. To clarify the role of this chemokine system in glial cell activation, we characterized the impact of CXCR3 on glial activation in a model of toxic demyelination in which glial activation without a prominent influx of hematogenous cells is prototypical. METHODS: We investigated the impact of CXCR3 on cuprizone-induced demyelination, comparing CXCR3-deficient mice with wild type controls. The clinical course during cuprizone feeding was documented for five weeks and for the subsequent four days withdrawal of the cuprizone diet (5.5 weeks). Glial activation was characterized using histological, histomorphometric and phenotypic analysis. Molecular analysis for (de)myelination and neuroinflammation was applied to characterize the effect of cuprizone on CXCR3-deficient mice and control animals. RESULTS: CXCR3-deficient mice displayed a milder clinical course during cuprizone feeding and a more rapid body weight recovery after offset of diet. In the CNS, CXCR3 deficiency significantly attenuated the accumulation and activation of microglia and astrocytes. Moreover, a deficiency of CXCR3 reduced the expression of the microglial activation markers CD45 and CD11b. Compared to controls, we observed a vast reduction of RNA levels for proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines like Ccl2, Cxcl10, Tnf and Il6 within the CNS of cuprizone-treated mice. Lastly, CXCR3 deficiency had no major effects on the course of demyelination during cuprizone feeding. CONCLUSIONS: The CXCR3 chemokine system is critically involved in the intrinsic glial activation during cuprizone-induced demyelination, which significantly modulates the distribution of glial cells and the local cytokine milieu.","Krauthausen, Marius; Saxe, Simon; Zimmermann, Julian; Emrich, Michael; Heneka, Michael T; Müller, Marcus",J Neuroinflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930935/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-11-109,60

Yet, research has shown that encoding instructions affect the false memories we form. On the one hand, instructing participants to imagine themselves manipulating the to-be-recalled items increase false memories (imagination inflation effect). But on the other hand, instructions to imagine have reduced false memories in the DRM paradigm (imagination facilitation effect). Here, we explored the effect of imaginal encoding with pragmatic inferences, a way to study false memories for information about everyday actions. Across two experiments, we manipulated imaginal encoding through the instructions given to participants and the after-item filler task (none vs. math operations). In Experiment 1, participants were either assigned to the encoding condition of imagine+no filler; pay attention+math; or memorize+math. In Experiment 2, the encoding instructions (imagine vs. memorize) and the filler task (none vs. math) were compared across four separate conditions. Results from the two experiments showed that imagination instructions lead to better memory, by showing a higher proportion of correct responses and better performance in a memory benefit index. Similarly, a significant reduction of false memories was observed across both experiments, even though a complementary Bayesian analysis only supported this conclusion for Experiment 1. The findings show that imaginal encoding improves memory, suggesting the engagement of a distinctiveness heuristic and source-monitoring process.","Maraver, María J.; Lapa, Ana; Garcia-Marques, Leonel; Carneiro, Paula; Raposo, Ana",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.668899; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34489789/,60

As a result, there has been a collective effort to monitor, predict, and control the spread of this disease. Among this effort is the development of mathematical models that could capture accurately the available data and simulate closely the futuristic scenarios. In this paper, a fractional-order memory-dependent model for simulating the spread of COVID-19 is proposed. In this model, the impact of governmental interventions and public perception are incorporated as part of the nonlinear time-varying transmission rate. In addition, an algorithm for approximating the optimal values of the fractional order and strength of governmental interventions is provided. This approach makes our model suitable for capturing the given data set and consequently reliable for future predictions. The model simulation is performed using the two-step generalized exponential time-differencing method and tested for data from Mainland China, Italy, Saudi Arabia and Brazil. The simulation results demonstrate that the fractional order model calibrates to the data better than its integer order counterpart. This observation is further endorsed by the calculated error metrics.","Furati, K.M.; Sarumi, I.O.; Khaliq, A.Q.M.",Appl Math Model,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2021.02.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X21000834?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0307904X21000834; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619419/,60

Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) family of enzymes are endogenous sources of somatic mutations found in multiple human cancers. While these enzymes normally act as an intrinsic immune defence against viruses, they can also catalyse ‘off-target’ cytidine deamination in genomic single-stranded DNA intermediates. The deamination of cytosine forms uracil, which is promutagenic in DNA. Key factors to trigger the APOBEC ‘off-target’ activity are overexpression in a non-normal cell type, nuclear localization and replication stress. The resulting uracil-induced mutations contribute to genomic variation, which may result in neutral, beneficial or harmful consequences for the cancer. This review summarizes the functional and biochemical basis of the APOBEC3 enzyme activity and highlights their relationship with the most well-studied cancers in this particular context such as breast, lung, bladder, and human papillomavirus-associated cancers. We focus on APOBEC3A, APOBEC3B and APOBEC3H haplotype I because they are the leading candidates as sources of somatic mutations in these and other cancers.

This decision set the tone for the revision of the Wildlife Protection Law (WPL), planned for release in late 2020. Both the terrestrial wildlife ban and revised WPL have the potential to greatly reduce consumption of wildlife and aid in prevention of future zoonotic disease outbreaks. The government still faces severe challenges in reducing wildlife use in traditional medicine, strengthening habitat and ecosystem conservation, committing to long-term WPL enforcement, and promoting community education and institutional reforms. However, recent progress in establishing a stricter ban on wildlife consumption, consolidating fragmented protected areas, and increased openness to public oversight are promising developments. While it is clear that global pandemics like COVID-19 can cause massive human suffering and disruption of economies; governments can no longer allow business as usual for the wildlife industry, regardless of the monetary or cultural values it brings.

Like other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, the envelope (E) protein of all DTMUV strains was N-glycosylated at the amino acid position 154. Thus far, the biological roles of DTMUV E glycosylation have remained largely unexplored. Herein, we demonstrated the key roles of E glycosylation in the replication and pathogenicity of DTMUV in ducks by characterizing the reverse-genetics-derived DTMUV wild-type MC strain and MC bearing mutations (N154Q and N154I) that abolish the E glycosylation. Our data showed that the disruption of E glycosylation could substantially impair virus attachment, entry, and infectivity in DEFs and C6/36 cells. Notably, ducks inoculated intracerebrally with the wild-type virus exhibited severe disease onset. In contrast, those inoculated with mutant viruses were mildly affected as manifested by minimal weight loss, no mortality, lower viral loads in the various tissues, and reduced brain lesions. Attenuated phenotypes of the mutant viruses might be partly associated with lower inflammatory cytokines expression in the brains of infected ducks. Our study offers the first evidence that E glycosylation is vital for DTMUV replication, pathogenicity, and neurovirulence in vivo.","Liu, Dejian; Xiao, Xuyao; Zhou, Peng; Zheng, Huijun; Li, Yaqian; Jin, Hui; Jongkaewwattana, Anan; Luo, Rui",Virulence,https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2021.1974329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34506259/,60

To evaluate the early effect of the administration of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines in LTCFs, we monitored subsequent SARS-CoV-2 documented infections and deaths in Catalonia, a region of Spain, and compared them to counterfactual model predictions from February 6th to March 28th, 2021, the subsequent time period after which 70% of residents were fully vaccinated. We calculated the reduction in SARS-CoV-2 documented infections and deaths as well as the detected county-level transmission. We estimated that once more than 70% of the LTCFs population were fully vaccinated, 74% (58%–81%, 90% CI) of COVID-19 deaths and 75% (36%–86%) of all documented infections were prevented. Further, detectable transmission was reduced up to 90% (76–93%). Our findings provide evidence that high-coverage vaccination is the most effective intervention to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission and death. Widespread vaccination could be a feasible avenue to control the COVID-19 pandemic.","De Salazar, Pablo M; Link, Nicholas; Lamarca, Karuna; Santillana, Mauricio",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.08.21255108; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.08.21255108v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33880479/,60

It is now an evident trace of a dramatic social problem, the characteristics of which are not attributable to certain economic, cultural, or religious conditions of the people involved but affect indiscriminately, in a unanimous way, our society. The study is a survey about the number of hospital admissions due to episodes attributable to violence against women, recorded by the Niguarda Hospital in Milan in the period 1 March–30 May from 2017 to 2020. This period, in 2020, corresponds to the coronavirus Lockdown in Italy. All the medical records of the Emergency department were reviewed, and the extracted data classified in order to identify the episodes of violence against women and the features of the reported injuries and the characteristics of the victims. The data did not show an increase in the number of cases in 2020 compared to previous years, but we did find a notable increase in the severity of injuries.","Nittari, Giulio; Sagaro, Getu Gamo; Feola, Alessandro; Scipioni, Mattia; Ricci, Giovanna; Sirignano, Ascanio",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33917305/,60
598505,FGF10 and Lipofibroblasts in Lung Homeostasis and Disease: Insights Gained From the Adipocytes,2021-05-26,"The human microbiome has been a focus of intense study in recent years. Most of the living organisms comprising the microbiome exist in the form of biofilms on mucosal surfaces lining our digestive, respiratory, and genito-urinary tracts. While health-associated microbiota contribute to digestion, provide essential nutrients, and protect us from pathogens, disturbances due to illness or medical interventions contribute to infections, some that can be fatal. Myriad biological processes influence the make-up of the microbiota, for example: growth, division, death, and production of extracellular polymers (EPS), and metabolites. Inter-species interactions include competition, inhibition, and symbiosis. Computational models are becoming widely used to better understand these interactions. Agent-based modeling is a particularly useful computational approach to implement the various complex interactions in microbial communities when appropriately combined with an experimental approach. In these models, each cell is represented as an autonomous agent with its own set of rules, with different rules for each species. In this review, we will discuss innovations in agent-based modeling of biofilms and the microbiota in the past five years from the biological and mathematical perspectives and discuss how agent-based models can be further utilized to enhance our comprehension of the complex world of polymicrobial biofilms and the microbiome.","Koshy-Chenthittayil, Sherli; Archambault, Linda; Senthilkumar, Dhananjai; Laubenbacher, Reinhard; Mendes, Pedro; Dongari-Bagtzoglou, Anna",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9020417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33671308/,60

The impact of this study is that it resulted in a guiding framework for teacher professional development (TPD) for online and blended learning (OBL). The basis of this study may be applied to explore the quick shift to digital teaching and learning amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. A potential limitation of the resulting framework in this study is that TPD for OBL needs may currently differ, as teachers are experiencing appreciably different learning and performance contexts related to the mandated shift in professional practice to address continuity of instruction. The application of the methodology in this study combined with quick response research approaches (Quarantelli, in: Stallings (ed) Methods of disaster research, Philadelphia, Xlibris, 2002) could potentially extend the Philipsen et al.

They are learnable and teachable. The learning should be facilitated with the help of a longitudinal curriculum, which is planned at Leipzig University. Project: At the Medical Faculty of Leipzig University, the Longitudinal Communication Curriculum is established since 2016/17. Up to now, the curriculum consists of four parts in which students repeatedly practise their communication skills in curricular and extracurricular courses. Several formats help to teach an integrated learning of communication and physical examination skills. Assessment of communication skills is also performed. Curricular implementation is accompanied by concomitant evaluation. Results: Three parts of the curriculum already have taken place. Students report an increase in communication skills. Students rate the units as instructive and helpful. The assessment of communication skills occurs in two clinical practical examinations (OSCEs). Together with summative assessment a formative feedback was implemented. Students judge this practice as highly positive. Discussion: The curriculum is part of undergraduate medical education in Leipzig. It would be beneficial to add another simulated patient encounter, as well as interprofessional units. Student questionnaires will be evaluated and results will help to develop the curriculum. Conclusion: Consolidation of the curriculum accompanied by evaluation and adaption of content can help to assure the quality of the curriculum. Additional professions and study units shall be integrated in the Longitudinal Communication Curriculum in the future.","Zimmermann, Anja; Baerwald, Christoph; Fuchs, Michael; Girbardt, Christian; Götze, Heide; Hempel, Gunther; von Klitzing, Kai; Rotzoll, Daisy",GMS J Med Educ,https://doi.org/10.3205/zma001454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33824894/,60
598728,A recent origin of Orf3a from M protein across the coronavirus lineage arising by sharp divergence,2020-12-04,"BACKGROUND: Health-care workers constitute a high-risk population for acquisition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Capacity for acute diagnosis via PCR testing was limited for individuals with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and a substantial proportion of health-care workers with suspected infection were not tested. We aimed to investigate the performance of point-of-care and laboratory serology assays and their utility in late case identification, and to estimate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. METHODS: We did a prospective multicentre cohort study between April 8 and June 12, 2020, in two phases. Symptomatic health-care workers with mild to moderate symptoms were eligible to participate 14 days after onset of COVID-19 symptoms, as per the Public Health England (PHE) case definition. Health-care workers were recruited to the asymptomatic cohort if they had not developed PHE-defined COVID-19 symptoms since Dec 1, 2019. In phase 1, two point-of-care lateral flow serological assays, the Onsite CTK Biotech COVID-19 split IgG/IgM Rapid Test (CTK Bitotech, Poway, CA, USA) and the Encode SARS-CoV-2 split IgM/IgG One Step Rapid Test Device (Zhuhai Encode Medical Engineering, Zhuhai, China), were evaluated for performance against a laboratory immunoassay (EDI Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 IgG ELISA kit [Epitope Diagnostics, San Diego, CA, USA]) in 300 samples from health-care workers and 100 pre-COVID-19 negative control samples. In phase 2 (n=6440), serosurveillance was done among 1299 (93·4%) of 1391 health-care workers reporting symptoms, and in a subset of asymptomatic health-care workers (405 [8·0%] of 5049). FINDINGS: There was variation in test performance between the lateral flow serological assays; however, the Encode assay displayed reasonable IgG sensitivity (127 of 136; 93·4% [95% CI 87·8–96·9]) and specificity (99 of 100; 99·0% [94·6–100·0]) among PCR-proven cases and good agreement (282 of 300; 94·0% [91·3–96·7]) with the laboratory immunoassay. By contrast, the Onsite assay had reduced sensitivity (120 of 136; 88·2% [95% CI 81·6–93·1]) and specificity (94 of 100; 94·0% [87·4–97·8]) and agreement (254 of 300; 84·7% [80·6–88·7]). Five (7%) of 70 PCR-positive cases were negative across all assays. Late changes in lateral flow serological assay bands were recorded in 74 (9·3%) of 800 cassettes (35 [8·8%] of 400 Encode assays; 39 [9·8%] of 400 Onsite assays), but only seven (all Onsite assays) of these changes were concordant with the laboratory immunoassay. In phase 2, seroprevalence among the workforce was estimated to be 10·6% (95% CI 7·6–13·6) in asymptomatic health-care workers and 44·7% (42·0–47·4) in symptomatic health-care workers. Seroprevalence across the entire workforce was estimated at 18·0% (95% CI 17·0–18·9). INTERPRETATION: Although a good positive predictive value was observed with both lateral flow serological assays and ELISA, this agreement only occurred if the pre-test probability was modified by a strict clinical case definition. Late development of lateral flow serological assay bands would preclude postal strategies and potentially home testing. Identification of false-negative results among health-care workers across all assays suggest caution in interpretation of IgG results at this stage; for now, testing is perhaps best delivered in a clinical setting, supported by government advice about physical distancing.

After excluding malaria and dengue, which are common causative agents of acute undifferentiated febrile illness (AUFI) in Thailand, chest radiography was performed according to the patient triage protocol of our institute for AUFI during the COVID-19 outbreak. Chest radiography revealed findings compatible with pneumonia. Nasopharyngeal, throat, and sputum samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcriptase–PCR. The preadmission diagnosis of COVID-19 in this patient enabled appropriate management and isolation to prevent nosocomial transmission. Fever and nonspecific symptoms and laboratory results in early COVID-19 may be difficult to distinguish from tropical infectious diseases, especially when respiratory signs and symptoms are absent.

We aimed to describe the spatial distribution of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide and assess the effects of various socio-ecological factors on COVID-19 risk. METHODS: We collected COVID-19 pandemic infection data and social-ecological data of 178 countries/regions worldwide from three database. We used spatial econometrics method to assess the global and local correlation of COVID-19 risk indicators for COVID-19. To estimate the adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR), we modelled negative binomial regression analysis with spatial information and socio-ecological factors. FINDINGS: The study indicated that 37, 29 and 39 countries/regions were strongly opposite from the IR, CMR and DCI index ""spatial autocorrelation hypothesis"", respectively. The IRs were significantly positively associated with GDP per capita, the use of at least basic sanitation services and social insurance program coverage, and were significantly negatively associated with the proportion of the population spending more than 25% of household consumption or income on out-of-pocket health care expenses and the poverty headcount ratio at the national poverty lines. The CMR was significantly positively associated with urban populations, GDP per capita and current health expenditure, and was significantly negatively associated with the number of hospital beds, number of nurses and midwives, and poverty headcount ratio at the national poverty lines. The DCI was significantly positively associated with urban populations, population density and researchers in R&D, and was significantly negatively associated with the number of hospital beds, number of nurses and midwives and poverty headcount ratio at the national poverty lines. We also found that climatic factors were not significantly associated with COVID-19 risk. CONCLUSION: Countries/regions should pay more attention to controlling population flow, improving diagnosis and treatment capacity, and improving public welfare policies.","Su, Dai; Chen, Yingchun; He, Kevin; Zhang, Tao; Tan, Min; Zhang, Yunfan; Zhang, Xingyu",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20077545v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511588/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.23.20077545,60
599305,CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor for detection of tick-borne diseases,2018-11-10,"Antimalaria drugs such as chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been administered to several inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, and infectious diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome and influenza. Recently, several patients infected with novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were given HCQ, and showed a discrepant response. HCQ inhibits SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, and inflammatory cascade by interfering with lysosomal and endosomal activities, and autophagy, impeding virus-membrane fusion, and inhibiting cytokine production resulted from inflammatory pathways activation. Despite ongoing administration of HCQ in a wide spectrum of disorders, there are some reports about several side effects, especially retinopathy in some patients treated with HCQ. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and its isoforms are the main metabolizers of HCQ and CQ. Pharmacokinetic properties of CYP enzymes are influenced by CYP polymorphism, non-coding RNAs, and epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, and histone acetylation. Accumulating evidence about side effects of HCQ in some patients raise the possibility that different response of patients to HCQ might be due to difference in their genome. Therefore, CYP450 genotyping especially for CYP2D6 might be helpful to refine HCQ dosage. Also, regular control of retina should be considered for patients under HCQ treatment. The major focus of the present review is to discuss about the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of CQ and HCQ that may be influenced by epigenetic mechanisms, and consequently cause several side effects especially retinopathy during SARS-CoV-2 therapy.","Paniri, Alireza; Hosseini, Mohammad Mahdi; Rasoulinejad, Ahmad; Akhavan-Niaki, Haleh",Eur J Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173454; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001429992030546X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32763298/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001429992030546X,60

We established a human GI tract cell line model highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2. These cells, C2BBe1 intestinal cells with a brush border having high levels of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), showed robust viral propagation, and could be persistently infected with SARS-CoV-2, supporting the clinical observations of persistent GI infection in COVID-19 patients. Ectopic expression of viral receptors revealed that the levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression confer permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and TMPRSS2 greatly facilitates ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 dissemination. Interestingly, ACE2 but not TMPRSS2 expression was significantly promoted by enterocytic differentiation, suggesting that the state of enterocytic differentiation may serve as a determining factor for viral propagation.

However, less is known about effective prevention and management strategies. The main objectives of the current project were to determine the impact of physical and psychological aggression on the well-being, health, and work ability of employees in the child welfare service and to establish whether a strong psychosocial safety climate and an ethical infrastructure are effective with regard to protecting employees against aggression. This project may help identify the specific risks child welfare workers are exposed to, the impact of workplace aggression on their health and well-being, and the most effective strategies to manage the problem. Furthermore, the findings should be central for developing laws and regulations and to any political decision on measures to tackle aggression in the workplace. METHODS: The study will employ two prospective data collections. Firstly, a three-wave longitudinal survey with a 6-month time lag between measurement points will be conducted among all 1,500 employees in the child welfare services in Oslo Municipality, Norway. Data will have a multilevel structure and will be linked to registry data on sickness absence. Secondly, a quantitative daily diary study over a 14-day period will include 150 of the respondents from the main survey study. The survey questionnaires mainly comprise well-established and psychometrically validated indicators of workplace aggression, health and well-being, psychosocial safety climate, ethical infrastructure, and other relevant factors. The Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REC) in Norway (REC South East) have approved this project (project no. 28496).

Clinical knowledge of severe CAP and acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by HAdV-55 is still limited, though the pathogen has been fully characterized by whole-genome sequencing. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre retrospective review of all consecutive patients with severe CAP caused by HAdV in immunocompetent adults admitted to the Emergency Department Intensive Care Unit of two hospitals in Northern China between February 2012 and April 2014. Clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics, treatments and outcomes of these patients were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 15 consecutive severe CAP patients with laboratory-confirmed adenovirus infections were included. The median age was 30 years and all cases were identified during the winter and spring seasons. HAdV-55 was the most frequently (11/15) detected HAdV type. Persistent high fever, cough and rapid progression of dyspnea were typically reported in these patients. Significantly increased pneumonia severity index (PSI), respiratory rate, and lower PaO(2)/FiO(2), hypersensitive CRP were reported in non-survivors compared to survivors (P = 0.013, 0.022, 0.019 and 0.026, respectively). The rapid development of bilateral consolidations within 10 days after illness onset were the most common radiographic finding, usually accompanied by adjacent ground glass opacities and pleural effusions. Total mortality was 26.7% in this study. Corticosteroids were prescribed to 14 patients in this report, but the utilization rate between survivors and non-survivors was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: HAdV and the HAdV-55 sub-type play an important role among viral pneumonia pathogens in hospitalized immunocompetent adults in Northern China.

The analysis of the S1 gene has been used to determine IBV genotype. The aim of this study was genotyping of IBVs circulating among the Iranian broiler flocks in the period between 2015 to 2017. Trachea samples from 278 broiler flocks were collected from broiler farms in eight provinces of Iran. After Real-time RT-PCR, IBV-positive samples were further characterized based on S1 gene. The results of the Real-time RT-PCR showed that 52.16% of flocks were IBV positive. Four genotypes were detected and the frequency of occurrence rates of IS-1494-like, 793/B, QX and Massachusetts IBV genotypes were 70.34%, 19.31%, 7.58% and 2.75%, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that nucleotide identities within IS-1494-like group ranged between 98.86–100%, while each of the QX, Massachusetts and 793/B groups were 98.05–100%, 98.20–100% and 93.29–100% respectively. These results show that the IS-1494-like IBV is the dominant IBV genotype in Iran. Proper control strategies are essential to overcoming the high frequency of occurrence of IS-1494-like IBV. The phylogenetic relationship of the strains with respect to different sequences and geographical regions displayed complexity and diversity. Further studies are needed and should include the isolation and full-length molecular characterization of IBV in Iran.","Modiri Hamadan, Amir; Ghalyanchilangeroudi, Arash; Hashemzadeh, Masoud; Hosseini, Hossein; Karimi, Vahid; Yahyaraeyat, Ramak; Najafi, Hamideh",Virus Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2017.08.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28789874/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170217303891; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170217303891,60
605104,"Human microRNA‐30 inhibits influenza virus infection by suppressing the expression of SOCS1, SOCS3, and NEDD4",2019-12-26,"BACKGROUND: Pertussis is a highly contagious disease of public health interest caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. Although its incidence has decreased substantially after the introduction of a vaccination, the burden of the disease remains high. Although the paroxysmal phase is highly disabling, complications are uncommon and more prevalent in children than in adults. The most frequent neurological complication is encephalopathy, but seizures, paresis, paraplegia, ataxias, aphasias, and decerebration postures have also been described. The complication of decerebration postures has not been previously reported in adults. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a video case of an adult HIV patient with severe coughing paroxysms, post-tussive emesis and syncope, whose workup confirmed the diagnosis of a B. pertussis respiratory infection. During hospitalization, he had fluctuant encephalopathy and post-tussive decerebration postures following paroxysms. He was treated with antibiotic therapy and finally sent home without residual neurological deficits. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the biological plausibility of neurologic complications of pertussis in adults, which, albeit rare, can cause important morbidities. Future research should explore whether there are differences in the clinical presentation, risk factors and pathophysiology of the disease among adults or interventions aimed at preventing or treating pertussis encephalopathy.","Arango-Granados, María Camila; Trompa, Iván Mauricio",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05198-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32615931/,60

We describe (1) the ECHO Program infrastructure that was designed to facilitate collaboration across over 1200 investigators and support the development of a cohort-wide data collection protocol and (2) the many challenges that were overcome in rapidly launching this large-scale program. Guided by a commitment to transparency, team science, and end user stakeholder engagement, ECHO successfully launched a unified study protocol and is working across disciplines to generate high-impact, solution-oriented research to improve children’s lives for generations to come. IMPACT: Many children in the United States experience chronic health conditions or do not reach their developmental potential. The Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program brings together 69 existing cohort studies comprising over 57,000 children to identify modifiable aspects of the early environment associated with pediatric outcomes with high public health impact: pre-, peri-, and postnatal outcomes; upper and lower airway health; obesity; neurodevelopment; and positive health.

605557,Human coronavirus NL63: a clinically important virus?,2011-03-02,"BACKGROUND: Shoulder range-of-motion (ROM) assessment is vital for the follow-up evaluation of operated patients and for the outcome-based research studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy and reliability of a remote on-screen application (app)-based method of shoulder ROM measurement through a telehealth medium. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consultant shoulder surgeon, a board-certified orthopedic resident, and a graduate medical doctor served as the examiners. The cohort consisted of 24 healthy volunteers and 16 symptomatic patients with expected shoulder ROM deficits. Shoulder ROM was first examined physically using a goniometer in the clinic and then over Zoom remote conferencing using the protractor extension app of the Chrome browser. RESULTS: Instrument validity was examined by comparing the goniometer method with the protractor app-based method of the expert shoulder consultant using Bland-Altman analysis. It showed only minor mean differences between the healthy volunteers and the patients in elevation (2.0° and 5.0°, respectively), abduction (2.0° and 3.0°, respectively), external rotation with the elbow adducted (1.9° and 0.2°, respectively), external rotation with the elbow abducted at 90° (0.4° and 4°, respectively), and internal rotation with elbow abducted at 90° (2.3° and 1.2°, respectively), with limits of agreement that were below the well-established minimal clinically important difference values. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values varied between 0.83 and 0.96 for the volunteers and between 0.90 and 0.98 for the patients, indicating excellent correlation between the 2 methods. The interobserver reliability between 2 examiners for the protractor app-based method as evaluated by ICC scores was excellent; it ranged between 0.86 and 0.98 for the volunteers and between 0.88 and 0.99 for the patients. Comparison of the protractor app-based method with the gold-standard goniometer method for the resident and the graduate doctor showed excellent ICC values. CONCLUSION: A protractor app-based method of measuring shoulder ROM over a telehealth medium is accurate and reliable compared with a clinical goniometer method. This validated method can be used during remote telehealth consultation with significant benefits of saving patients travel and time during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and even later.","Sahu, Dipit; Shah, Darshil; Joshi, Moksha; Shaikh, Sana; Gaikwad, Priyanka; Shyam, Ashok",J. shoulder elbow surg,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jse.2021.06.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352402/,60

Yet, olfactory and taste dysfunction are rather common in COVID-19, especially in pauci-symptomatic patients which constitutes the most frequent clinical manifestation of the infection. We conducted a virologic, molecular, and cellular study of the olfactory system from COVID-19 patients presenting acute loss of smell, and report evidence that the olfactory epithelium represents a highly significant infection site where multiple cell types, including olfactory sensory neurons, support cells and immune cells, are infected. Viral replication in the olfactory epithelium is associated with local inflammation. Furthermore, we show that SARS-CoV-2 induces acute anosmia and ageusia in golden Syrian hamsters, both lasting as long as the virus remains in the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb. Finally, olfactory mucosa sampling in COVID-19 patients presenting with persistent loss of smell reveals the presence of virus transcripts and of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, together with protracted inflammation. Viral persistence in the olfactory epithelium therefore provides a potential mechanism for prolonged or relapsing symptoms of COVID-19, such as loss of smell, which should be considered for optimal medical management and future therapeutic strategies.","De Melo, Guilherme Dias; Lazarini, Françoise; Levallois, Sylvain; Hautefort, Charlotte; Michel, Vincent; Larrous, Florence; Verillaud, Benjamin; Aparicio, Caroline; Wagner, Sebastien; Gheusi, Gilles; Kergoat, Lauriane; Kornobis, Etienne; Cokelaer, Thomas; Hervochon, Rémi; Madec, Yoann; Roze, Emmanuel; Salmon, Dominique; Bourhy, Hervé; Lecuit, Marc; Lledo, Pierre-Marie",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.18.388819,60

DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study using publicly available data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. SETTING: Nationwide. PARTICIPANTS: 5857 patients younger than 20 years old, all of them hospitalised with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, from 1 January 2020 to 7 December 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: We used multilevel mixed-effects generalised linear models to study in-hospital mortality, stratifying the analysis by age, region of the country, presence of non-communicable diseases, ethnicity and socioeconomic development. RESULTS: Individually, most of the included comorbidities were risk factors for mortality. Notably, asthma was a protective factor (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.67). Having more than one comorbidity increased almost tenfold the odds of death (OR 9.67, 95% CI 6.89 to 13.57). Compared with white children, Indigenous, Pardo (mixed) and East Asian had significantly higher odds of mortality (OR 5.83, 95% CI 2.43 to 14.02; OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.51; OR 2.98, 95% CI 1.02 to 8.71, respectively). We also found a regional influence (higher mortality in the North—OR 3.4, 95% CI 2.48 to 4.65) and a socioeconomic association (lower mortality among children from more socioeconomically developed municipalities—OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.38) CONCLUSIONS: Besides the association with comorbidities, we found ethnic, regional and socioeconomic factors shaping the mortality of children hospitalised with COVID-19 in Brazil.

607671,SARS Coronavirus Spike Protein-Induced Innate Immune Response occurs via Activation of the NF-κB pathway in Human Monocyte Macrophages in vitro,2009-06-01,"BACKGROUND: Co-creation strategies, such as cooperative planning, are promising as a means to ensure that physical activity interventions address real-world problems and are tailored to the target group. This has already been validated in diverse settings. However, questions targeting the transferability of cooperative planning to new settings and the key factors influencing its success or failure remain unclear. At the same time, co-creation processes are complex, and evaluation can be challenging. Following calls for detailed reporting, this paper describes the programme activities, the underlying logic, and methodological design of a study that aims to evaluate the transfer of cooperative planning to new settings and to explore the associated key determinants. METHODS: Cooperative planning was utilized as a strategy to target physical activity promotion in three real-world German settings in the nursing care and automotive mechatronics sectors. This involved researchers working alongside stakeholders from practice and policy to conjointly develop new interventions to promote physical activity in physically demanding jobs. A pragmatic approach is used to evaluate both the transferability and key determinants of this strategy. We developed a logic model for this co-creation process that describes the underlying assumptions and guides the evaluation. The evaluation outcomes of this study include planning meetings, newly developed interventions, and the determinants that are likely to affect cooperative planning. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected using questionnaires, documents, and interviews. The quantitative data will be analysed descriptively, while the qualitative data will mainly be analysed using qualitative content analysis, split by settings. Subsequently, data triangulation will be used to integrate the quantitative and qualitative findings, which will then be compared across all three settings. DISCUSSION: The study findings will contribute to a better understanding of co-creation strategies, their transferability, and key determinants. The practical implications can include a checklist for assessing key determinants and a guideline for transferring cooperative planning into new settings to benefit more people. Ultimately, this study will help to advance co-creation strategies and may be relevant for researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers targeting physical activity promotion in various contexts.

Methods: Caldicott Guardian approval was obtained and requirement for ethical approval was waived by the local research ethics service. All pregnant or recently pregnant patients (within 6 weeks post-partum) within our health board area with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test between 16 March 2020 and 18 December 2020 were retrospectively identified from regional infection surveillance and local obstetric unit reports. Residential area deprivation was classified using the Scottish Index for Multiple Deprivation (SIMD), with quintile 1 representing the most deprived and quintile 5 representing the least deprived areas. R version 4.0.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) was used to perform analyses. Results: Over the study period, 97 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Comparison between those in the lowest and highest SIMD quintiles is as shown below. Those from a black or ethnic minority background accounted for 31.9% of positive test results and 50% of admissions to critical care. [Formula presented] Discussion: In this cohort of obstetric patients, mothers from socioeconomically disadvantaged areas accounted for a higher proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases (and hospital / critical care admissions) than those from more affluent areas. This is, to our knowledge, the first study to investigate this association in obstetric patients.

Proteolysis of OPN by thrombin, matrix metalloproteases, caspase 8/3, cathepsin D, plasmin, and enterokinase generates various cleaved OPNs with a variety of bioactivities by binding to different target cells. Moreover, OPN is susceptible to gradual proteolysis. During inflammation, one of the cleaved fragments, N-terminal thrombin-cleaved OPN (trOPN or OPN-Arg(168) [OPN-R]), induces dendritic cell (DC) adhesion. Further cleavage by carboxypeptidase B2 or carboxypeptidase N removes Arg(168) from OPN-R to OPN-Leu(167) (OPN-L). Consequently, OPN-L decreases DC adhesion. In particular, the differences in plasma level over time are observed between FL-OPN and its cleaved OPNs during inflammation. We found that the undefined OPN levels (mixture of FL-OPN and cleaved OPN) were elevated in plasma and reflected the pathology of TB and COVID-19 rather than FL-OPN. These infections are associated with elevated levels of various proteases. Inhibition of the cleavage or the activities of cleaved products may improve the outcome of the therapy. Research on the metabolism of OPN is expected to create new therapies against infectious diseases.","Hattori, Toshio; Iwasaki-Hozumi, Hiroko; Bai, Gaowa; Chagan-Yasutan, Haorile; Shete, Ashwnini; Telan, Elizabeth Freda; Takahashi, Atsushi; Ashino, Yugo; Matsuba, Takashi",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34440210/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9081006,60

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of HCQ treatment on QT interval METHODS: We retrospectively studied the electrocardiograms of 819 patients treated with HCQ for rheumatologic diseases from 2000 to 2020. The primary outcome was corrected QT (QTc) interval, by Bazett formula, during HCQ therapy. RESULTS: The patients were 64.0 (±10.9) years in age and 734 (90%) were men. The median dosage and duration of HCQ were 400mg daily and 1006 (471-2075) days, respectively. The mean on-treatment QTc was 430.9 (±31.8) msec. In total, 55 (7%) patients had QTc 470-500 msec and 12 (1.5%) had QTc >500msec. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure were independent risk factors for prolonged QTc. In a subset of 591 patients who also had a pre-treatment ECG, the mean QTc increased from 424.4 (±29.7) msec. to 432.0 (±32.3) msec (p<0.0001) during HCQ treatment. Of these, 23 (3.9%) patients had either prolongation of QTc >15% or an on-treatment QTc >500 msec. Over 5.97 (3.33-10.11) years of follow-up, 269 (33%) patients died. QTc >470 msec during HCQ treatment was associated with a greater mortality risk of (hazard ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.16-2.71; p=0.008) in univariable but not in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: Hydroxychloroquine is associated with QT prolongation in a significant fraction of patients. The risk of QT prolongation is higher among patients with CKD, AF and heart failure, who may benefit from greater scrutiny.","Hooks, Matthew; Bart, Bradley; Vardeny, Orly; Westanmo, Anders; Adabag, Selçuk",Heart Rhythm,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1547527120306287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32610165/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1547527120306287?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.06.029,60

In early January 2020, a novel strain of β-coronavirus was identified by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention from the pharyngeal swab specimens of patients, which was recently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is evidence of human-to-human transmission and familial cluster outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The World Health Organization(WHO) recently declared the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic a global health emergency. As of February 17, 2020, 71329 laboratory-confirmed cases (in 25 countries, including the United States and Germany) have been reported globally. Other than its rapid transmission, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain unclear. In December 2019, coronavirus disease (named COVID-19 by the WHO) associated with the SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China and spread quickly across the country. AIM: To analyze the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of confirmed cases of this disease in Liaoning province, a Chinese region about 1800 km north of Wuhan. METHODS: The clinical data of 56 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases due to 2019-nCoV infection were analyzed. The cases originated from eight cities in Liaoning province. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 45 years, and 57.1% of them were male. No patient had been in direct contact with wild animals. Among them, 23 patients (41.1%) had resided in or traveled to Wuhan, 27 cases (48.2%) had been in contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients, 5 cases (8.9%) had been in contact with confirmed patients with a contact history to COVID-19 patients, and 1 case (1.8%) had no apparent history of exposure. Fever (75.0%) and cough (60.7%) were the most common symptoms. The typical manifestations in lung computed tomography (CT) included ground-glass opacity and patchy shadows, with 67.8% of them being bilateral. Among the patients in the cohort, 78.6% showed reduction in their lymphocyte counts, 57.1% showed increases in their C-reactive protein levels, and 50.0% showed decreases in their blood albumin levels. Eleven patients (19.6%) were admitted to intensive care unit, 2 patients (3.5%) progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, 4 patients (7.1%) were equipped with non-invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1 patient (1.8) received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. There were 5 mild cases (5/56, 8.9%), 40 moderate cases (40/56, 71.4%), 10 severe cases (10/56, 17.9%), and 1 critical case (1/56, 1.8%). No deaths were reported. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted among humans. Most COVID-19 patients show symptoms of fever, cough, lymphocyte reduction, and typical lung CT manifestations. Most are moderate cases. The seriousness of the disease (as indicated by blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, oxygenation index, blood lymphocyte count, and lesions shown in lung CT) is related to history of living in or traveling to Wuhan, underlying diseases, admittance to intensive care unit, and mechanical ventilation.","Wang, Jing-Bo; Wang, Hai-Tao; Wang, Lei-Shi; Li, Lu-Ping; Xv, Jiao; Xv, Chun; Li, Xing-Hai; Wu, Yun-Hai; Liu, Hong-Yan; Li, Bai-Jun; Yu, Hong; Tian, Xia; Zhang, Zhi-Yu; Wang, Yan; Zhao, Rui; Liu, Jin-Yang; Wang, Wei; Gu, Ye",World J Clin Cases,https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v8.i21.5188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33269255/,60

Loss of Sia production can cause the developmental of defects and lethality in most animals; hence, animal cells are less prone to evolution of resistance to interactions by rapidly evolved Sia-binding viruses. Obligative intracellular viruses mostly have rapid evolution that allows escape from host immunity, leading to an epidemic variant, and that allows emergence of a novel strain, occasionally leading to pandemics that cause health-social-economic problems. Recently, much attention has been given to the mutual recognition systems via sialosugar chains between viruses and their host cells and there has been rapid growth of the research field “sialoglycovirology.” In this chapter, the structural diversity of sialoglycoconjugates is overviewed, and enveloped and non-enveloped viruses that bind to Sia are reviewed. Also, interactions of viral lectins-host Sia receptors, which determine viral transmission, host range, and pathogenesis, are presented. The future direction of new therapeutic routes targeting viral lectins, development of easy-to-use detection methods for diagnosis and monitoring changes in virus binding specificity, and challenges in the development of suitable viruses to use in virus-based therapies for genetic disorders and cancer are discussed.","Sriwilaijaroen, Nongluk; Suzuki, Yasuo",Lectin Purification and Analysis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32306355/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-0430-4_47,60

In contrast to a standard SIR model, we find that the incidence of COVID-19 spread is concave in the number of infectious individuals, as would be expected if people have inter-related social networks. This concave shape has a significant impact on forecasted COVID-19 cases. In particular, our model forecasts that the number of COVID-19 cases would only have an exponential growth for a brief period at the beginning of the contagion event or right after a reopening, but would quickly settle into a prolonged period of time with stable, slightly declining levels of disease spread. This pattern is consistent with observed levels of COVID-19 cases in the US, but inconsistent with standard SIR modeling. We forecast rates of new cases for COVID-19 under different social distancing norms and find that if social distancing is eliminated there will be a massive increase in the cases of COVID-19.","Liu, Meng; Thomadsen, Raphael; Yao, Song",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-77292-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33230234/,60

617630,Mapping host restriction of SARS-CoV-2,2020-12-01,"Filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and medical masks are widely used to reduce the inhalation exposure of airborne particulates and biohazardous aerosols. Their protective capacity largely depends on the fraction of these that are filtered from the incoming air volume. While the performance and physics of different filter materials have been the topic of intensive study, less well understood are the effects of mask sealing. To address this, we introduce an approach to calculate the influence of face-seal leakage on filtration ratio and fit factor based on an analytical model and a finite element method (FEM) model, both of which take into account time-dependent human respiration velocities. Using these, we calculate the filtration ratio and fit factor for a range of ventilation resistance values relevant to filter materials, 500–2500 Pa∙s∙m(−1), where the filtration ratio and fit factor are calculated as a function of the mask gap dimensions, with good agreement between analytical and numerical models. The results show that the filtration ratio and fit factor are decrease markedly with even small increases in gap area. We also calculate particle filtration rates for N95 FFRs with various ventilation resistances and two commercial FFRs exemplars. Taken together, this work underscores the critical importance of forming a tight seal around the face as a factor in mask performance, where our straightforward analytical model can be readily applied to obtain estimates of mask performance.","Xu, Mingxin; Lee, Peter; Collins, David",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33596228/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246720,60

We examined the major storylines that depicted this explosive spread of COVID-19 around the globe. METHODS: A detailed review of World Health Organization (WHO) situation reports, surveillance summaries, and online resources allowed us to quantify the increases in cases and deaths by region and by country throughout the month of March 2020. RESULTS: During March, COVID-19 was officially declared by the WHO to be a pandemic. COVID-19 emerged from a focalized outbreak in the Western Pacific Region and rapidly proliferated across all continents worldwide. Globally, cumulative numbers of confirmed cases increased by a factor of nine throughout the month. During the entire month, cases rose exponentially throughout Europe. Starting in mid-March, confirmed cases accelerated coast-to-coast throughout the United States and, on March 26, the United States surpassed all other nations to rank first in numbers of cases. COVID-19 mortality lagged several weeks behind but by month’s end, death tolls were also rising exponentially.

In last few decades, nanoscience has attracted the attention of the scientific community worldwide due to its potential uses in the pharmacy, medical diagnostics and disease treatment, energy, electronics, agriculture, chemical and space industries. The properties of nanoparticles (NPs) are size and shape dependent. These characteristic features of nanoparticles can be explored for various other applications such as computer transistors, chemical sensors, electrometers, memory schemes, reusable catalysts, biosensing, antimicrobial activity, nanocomposites, medical imaging, tumor detection and drug delivery. Therefore, synthesizing nanoparticles of desired size, structure, monodispersity and morphology is crucial for the aforementioned applications. Recent advancements in nanotechnology aim at the synthesis of nanoparticles/materials using reliable, innoxious and novel ecofriendly techniques. In contrast to the traditional methods, the biosynthesis of nanoparticles of a desired nature and structure using the microbial machinery is not only quicker and safer but more environmentally friendly. Various microbes, including bacteria, actinobacteria, fungi, yeast, microalgae and viruses, have recently been explored for the synthesis of metal, metal oxide and other important NPs through intracellular and extracellular processes. Some bacteria and microalgae possess specific potential to fabricate distinctive nanomaterials such as exopolysaccharides, nanocellulose, nanoplates and nanowires. Moreover, their ability to synthesize nanoparticles can be enhanced using genetic engineering approaches. Thus, the use of microorganisms for synthesis of nanoparticles is unique and has a promising future. The present review provides explicit information on different strategies for the synthesis of nanoparticles using microbial cells; their applications in bioremediation, agriculture, medicine and diagnostics; and their future prospects.","Koul, Bhupendra; Poonia, Anil Kumar; Yadav, Dhananjay; Jin, Jun-O",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34203733/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom11060886,60

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible effects of Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and social isolation process on individuals’ nutritional behaviours and body weight changes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Nutritional behaviours of the participants before the COVID-19 pandemic and in the social isolation process were evaluated with the Three Factor Nutrition Questionnaire. The changes in individuals’ body weight during this period were also evaluated. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1036 volunteer individuals (827 women, 209 men) aged 18 years and over participated in the study. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic and social isolation process, there was an increase in emotional eating and uncontrolled eating behaviours of individuals, but no significant change in cognitive restriction behaviour occurred (P = <0·00; P = <0·00 and P = 0·53, respectively). It was reported that the body weight of 35 % of the individuals who participated in the study increased during this period.

A common element of the activity of nutraceuticals is their ability to enhance the innate immune response against pathogens by acting on the major cellular subsets and inducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides. In some cases, this action is accompanied by a direct antimicrobial effect, as evidenced in the specific case of lactoferrin. Furthermore, nutraceuticals act through complex molecular mechanisms to minimize the damage caused by the activation of the immune system against pathogens, reducing the oxidative damage, influencing the antigen presentation, enhancing the differentiation and proliferation of regulatory T cells, driving the differentiation of lymphocyte subsets, and modulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this paper, we review the main molecular mechanisms responsible for the immunomodulatory function of nutraceuticals, focusing on the most relevant aspects for the prevention and treatment of viral infections.","Costagliola, Giorgio; Nuzzi, Giulia; Spada, Erika; Comberiati, Pasquale; Verduci, Elvira; Peroni, Diego G.",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34371920/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13072410,60

Background: Motherhood among Roma girls (RGM) in Europe impoverishes their lives, puts them at risk of poor physical and mental health and precipitates school dropouts. Overwhelming evidence affirms that the conditions of poverty and the social exclusionary processes they suffer have a very important explanatory weight in their sexual and reproductive decisions. Methods: Through a Community-based Participatory Action Research design, 20–25 Roma girls will be recruited in each one of the four impoverished communities in Bulgaria, Romania and Spain. Data collection and analysis: Desk review about scientific evidences and policies will be carried out to frame the problem. Narratives of Roma women as well as baseline and end line interviews of girl participants will be collected through both qualitative and quantitative techniques. Quantitative data will be gathered through reliable scales of mattering, socio–political agency, satisfaction with life and self. A narrative analysis of the qualitative information generated in the interviews will be carried out. Expected results: (1) uncover contextual and psychosocial patterns of girl-motherhood among Roma women; (2) build critical thinking among Roma girls to actively participate in all decisions affecting them and advocate for their own gender rights within their communities; and (3) empower Roma girls and their significant adults to critically evaluate their own initiatives and provide feedback to their relevant stakeholders.

Several reports indicate the possibility of viral shedding via faeces and the possibility of faecal‐oral transmission. AIMS: To critically assess the clinical relevance of testing stool samples and anal swabs and provide an overview of the potential faecal‐oral transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2. METHODS: A systematic literature search with MeSH terms was performed, scrutinising the Embase database, Google scholar, MEDLINE database through PubMed and The Cochrane Library, including articles from December 2019 until July 7 2020. Data were subsequently analysed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Ninety‐five studies were included in the qualitative analysis. 934/2149 (43%) patients tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 in stool samples or anal swabs, with positive test results up to 70 days after symptom onset. A meta‐analysis executed with studies of at least 10 patients revealed a pooled positive proportion of 51.8% (95% CI 43.8 ‐ 59.7%). Positive faecal samples of 282/443 patients (64%) remained positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 for a mean of 12.5 days, up to 33 days maximum, after respiratory samples became negative for SARS‐CoV‐2. Viable SARS‐CoV‐2 was found in 6/17 (35%) patients in whom this was specifically investigated. CONCLUSIONS: Viral shedding of SARS‐CoV‐2 in stool samples occurs in a substantial portion of patients, making faecal‐oral transmission plausible. Furthermore, detection in stool sample or anal swab can persist long after negative respiratory testing. Therefore, stool sample or anal swab testing should be (re)considered in relation to decisions for isolating or discharging a patient.","van Doorn, Amarylle S.; Meijer, Berrie; Frampton, Chris M.

A Review of the Literature,2020-09-03,"RNA motifs may promote interactions with exosomes (EXO-motifs) and lipid rafts (RAFT-motifs) that are enriched in exosomal membranes. These interactions can promote selective RNA loading into exosomes. We quantified the affinity between RNA aptamers containing various EXO- and RAFT-motifs and membrane lipid rafts in a liposome model of exosomes by determining the dissociation constants. Analysis of the secondary structure of RNA molecules provided data about the possible location of EXO- and RAFT-motifs within the RNA structure. The affinity of RNAs containing RAFT-motifs (UUGU, UCCC, CUCC, CCCU) and some EXO-motifs (CCCU, UCCU) to rafted liposomes is higher in comparison to aptamers without these motifs, suggesting direct RNA-exosome interaction. We have confirmed these results through the determination of the dissociation constant values of exosome-RNA aptamer complexes. RNAs containing EXO-motifs GGAG or UGAG have substantially lower affinity to lipid rafts, suggesting indirect RNA-exosome interaction via RNA binding proteins. Bioinformatics analysis revealed RNA aptamers containing both raft- and miRNA-binding motifs and involvement of raft-binding motifs UCCCU and CUCCC. A strategy is proposed for using functional RNA aptamers (fRNAa) containing both RAFT-motif and a therapeutic motif (e.g., miRNA inhibitor) to selectively introduce RNAs into exosomes for fRNAa delivery to target cells for personalized therapy.","Mańka, Rafał; Janas, Pawel; Sapoń, Karolina; Janas, Teresa; Janas, Tadeusz",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22179416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34502324/,60

They require integrated measures to both reduce the spread of COVID-19 and response to disasters. The measures to mitigate damage of disaster amid COVID-19 can become expensive and inefficient compared to single disaster responses, resulting in delays. Hence, a balance is crucial to successfully manage co-occurring disasters, and new holistic approaches are necessary to produce efficient responses during the COVID-19 outbreak.

622636,SARS coronavirus spike polypeptide DNA vaccine priming with recombinant spike polypeptide from Escherichia coli as booster induces high titer of neutralizing antibody against SARS coronavirus,2005-10-10,"BACKGROUND: In its pursuance of universal health coverage (UHC), the government of Benin is piloting a project of mandatory social insurance for health entitled “ARCH”. METHODS: We analysed budget data and ARCH documents, and conducted four observation missions in Benin between March 2018 and January 2020. Results are presented in terms of the three classical objectives of public expenditure management. RESULTS: The government of Benin faces important budgeting challenges when it comes to implementing the ARCH social insurance project: (i) the fiscal space is quite limited, there is a limited potential for new taxes and these may not benefit the ARCH funding, hence the need to prioritise fiscal resources without jeopardising other areas; (ii) the purchasing of health services should be more strategic so as to increase allocative efficiency and equity; (iii) the efficiency of the expenditure process needs to be improved, and more autonomy needs to be devoted to the operational level, so as to ensure that health facilities are reimbursed in a timely fashion in order to meet insured people’s health costs, in such a way as to avoid jeopardizing the financial equilibrium of these facilities. CONCLUSION: The important budgeting challenges faced by Benin when it comes to implementing its UHC policy are also faced by many other African countries. It is important to avoid a situation in which the resources dedicated by the government to the social health insurance system are at the expense of a reduction in the financing of preventive and promotional primary healthcare services.","Paul, Elisabeth; Sambiéni, N’koué Emmanuel; Wangbe, Jean-Pierre; Fecher, Fabienne; Bourgeois, Marc",Health Econ Rev,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13561-020-00286-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32889650/,60
623110,Isolation and characterization of a bat SARS-like coronavirus that uses the ACE2 receptor,2013-10-30,"[Image: see text] The rapid and relentless emergence of novel highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants, possibly decreasing vaccine efficacy, currently represents a formidable medical and societal challenge. These variants frequently hold mutations on the Spike protein’s receptor-binding domain (RBD), which, binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, mediates viral entry into host cells. Here, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and dynamical network theory of the wild-type and mutant RBD/ACE2 adducts disclose that while the N501Y mutation (UK variant) enhances the Spike’s binding affinity toward ACE2, the concomitant N501Y, E484K, and K417N mutations (South African variant) aptly adapt to increase SARS-CoV-2 propagation via a two-pronged strategy: (i) effectively grasping ACE2 through an allosteric signaling between pivotal RBD structural elements and (ii) impairing the binding of antibodies elicited by infected or vaccinated patients. This information unlocks the molecular terms and evolutionary strategies underlying the increased virulence of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, setting the basis for developing the next-generation anti-COVID-19 therapeutics.","Spinello, Angelo; Saltalamacchia, Andrea; Borišek, Jure; Magistrato, Alessandra",J Phys Chem Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34161095/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.1c01415,60

623337,Highly sensitive nanomechanical assay for the stress transmission of carbon chain,2013-06-19,"In Brazil, rabies surveillance is based on monitoring domestic and wild animals, although the most prevalent lineage of the rabies virus (RABV) currently diagnosed in Brazil is associated with bats, particularly non-haematophagous bats. Disease control is based on the mass vaccination of dogs and cats. We used data collected by the passive surveillance system of the city of Campinas from 2011 to 2015, to describe the temporal and geographic distributions of the bat specimens and RABV and discuss the current rabies surveillance with the advent of the declaration of canine and feline rabies-free areas in Brazil. We described the species, locations and health statuses of the collected bat specimens. Moreover, all samples were submitted for RABV diagnosis. Then, we performed a time series decomposition for each bat family. Additionally, we determined the spatiotemporal relative risk for RABV infection using the ratio of the kernel-smoothed estimates of spatiotemporal densities of RABV-positive and RABV-negative bats. From the 2537 bat specimens, the most numerous family was Molossidae (72%), followed by Vespertilionidae (14%) and Phyllostomidae (13%). The bat families behaved differently in terms of seasonal and spatial patterns. The distribution of bats varied geographically in the urban environment, with Molossidae and Phyllostomidae being observed downtown and Vespertilionidae being observed in peripheral zones. Concurrently, a significant relative risk of RABV infection was observed downtown for Vespertilionidae and in peripheral zones for Molossidae. No RABV-positive sample clusters were observed. As a result of the official declaration of RABV-free areas in southern Brazil, mass dog and cat vaccinations are expected to halt in the near future. This stoppage would make most dog and cat populations susceptible to other RABV lineages, such as those maintained by non-haematophagous bats. In this scenario, all information available on bats and RABV distribution in urban areas is essential. Currently, few studies have been conducted. Some local health authorities, such as that in Campinas, are spontaneously basing their surveillance efforts on bat rabies, which is the alternative in reality scenario of increased susceptibility to bat-associated RABV that is developing in Brazil.","Dias, R.

623498,Development of rhinovirus study model using organ culture of turbinate mucosa,2005-01-14,"We hypothesized that visits to green and blue spaces may have enabled respite, connection and exercise during the COVID-19 pandemic, but such benefits might have been inequitably distributed due to differences in financial difficulties, opportunities to work from home, and localized restrictions in spatial mobility generated by ‘lockdowns’. A nationally representative online and telephone survey conducted in 12–26 October on the Social Research Centre’s Life in Australia(TM) panel (aged ≥ 18 y, 78.8% response, N = 3043) asked about access, visitation, and felt benefits from green and/or blue spaces. Increasing financial difficulty was associated with less time in and fewer visits to green and/or blue spaces, as well as fewer different types visited. Financial difficulty was also associated with feelings that visits to green and/or blue space had less benefit for maintaining social connection. Working from home was associated with more frequent and longer visitation to green and/or blue spaces, as well as discovery of ones previously unvisited. Working from home was also associated with increased levels of exercise and respite resulting from visits to green and/or blue spaces. Residents of Melbourne, a city of 4.9 million who were in ‘lockdown’ at the time of the survey, appeared more likely to benefit from visits to green and/or blue spaces than residents of Sydney, Australia’s largest city at 5.2 million, who were not in lockdown. Residents of Melbourne compared with Sydney reported consistently increased visitation of, discovery of, and greater levels of various felt benefits derived from green and/or blue spaces, including more respite, connection, and exercise. Comparatively shorter distances to preferred green and/or blue spaces and closure of alternative settings at the time of the survey completion in Melbourne compared with Sydney may provide partial explanation, though more acute responses to experiencing green and/or blue spaces within highly cognitively demanding antecedent conditions posed by lockdown are also plausible and warrant further investigation with other health indicators. These results were robust to adjustment for a range of covariates including preferences for natural settings, which were consistently associated with greater levels of green and/or blue space visitation and felt benefits. Collectively, these results indicate that parallel efforts to generate (or renew) felt connection to natural settings, to increase working from home opportunities, and to mitigate financial difficulties may be important to help maximize the population health benefits of urban planning strategies intended to improve the availability of, and to reduce inequities in access to, green and blue spaces. Benefits felt more commonly by people living through lockdown underlines the role previous investments in green and blue space have played in enabling coping during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Astell-Burt, Thomas; Feng, Xiaoqi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33803166/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18052757,60

ELISA-reactive samples were further tested by indirect fluorescent antibody and microneutralization assays. Of the 443 tested samples, 12 (2.7%) had a reactive ELISA result, and 9 of the 12 had reactive indirect fluorescent antibody and microneutralization assay titers. Undertaking clinical trials of convalescent plasma for passive immunotherapy of MERS-CoV infection may be feasible, but such trials would be challenging because of the small pool of potential donors with sufficiently high antibody titers. Alternative strategies to identify convalescent plasma donors with adequate antibody titers should be explored, including the sampling of serum from patients with more severe disease and sampling at earlier points during illness.","Arabi, Yaseen M.; Hajeer, Ali H.; Luke, Thomas; Raviprakash, Kanakatte; Balkhy, Hanan; Johani, Sameera; Al-Dawood, Abdulaziz; Al-Qahtani, Saad; Al-Omari, Awad; Al-Hameed, Fahad; Hayden, Frederick G.; Fowler, Robert; Bouchama, Abderrezak; Shindo, Nahoko; Al-Khairy, Khalid; Carson, Gail; Taha, Yusri; Sadat, Musharaf; Alahmadi, Mashail",Emerg Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2209.151164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27532807/,60

DESIGN: A prospective quasiexperimental design with a control group. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 120 nurses were recruited and randomly divided into the control group and the intervention group. INTERVENTION: Participants underwent a 3-month training. The control group received the conventional training of emergency response (eg, theoretical lectures, technical skills and psychological training), while the intervention group underwent the virtual reality simulation training in combination with skills training. The COVID-19 cases were incorporated into the intervention group training, and the psychological training was identical to both groups. At the end of the training, each group conducted emergency drills twice. Before and after the intervention, the two groups were assessed for the knowledge and technical skills regarding responses to fulminate respiratory infectious diseases, as well as the capacity of emergency care. Furthermore, their pandemic preparedness was assessed with a disaster preparedness questionnaire. RESULTS: After the intervention, the scores of the relevant knowledge, the capacity of emergency care and disaster preparedness in the intervention group significantly increased (p<0.01). The score of technical skills in the control group increased more significantly than that of the intervention group (p<0.01). No significant difference was identified in the scores of postdisaster management in two groups (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: The virtual reality simulation training in combination with technical skills training can improve the response capacity of emergency reserve nurses as compared with the conventional training. The findings of the study provide some evidence for the emergency training of reserve nurses in better response to public health emergencies and suggest this methodology is worthy of further research and popularisation.","Zhang, Dandan; Liao, Hongwu; Jia, Yitong; Yang, Wenren; He, Pingping; Wang, Dongmei; Chen, Yongjun; Yang, Wei; Zhang, Yin-Ping",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34551944/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048611,60

The increase in crude COVID-19 mortality rates for the prison population has outpaced the rates for the general population. People in prison experienced a significantly higher mortality burden compared to the general population (standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 2.75; 95% confidence interval = 2.54, 2.96).

Under such circumstances, telepsychiatry is gaining importance and attracting a great deal of attention. However, few large pragmatic clinical trials on the use of telepsychiatry targeting multiple psychiatric disorders have been conducted to date. Methods: The targeted study cohort will consist of adults (>18 years) who meet the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for either (1) depressive disorders, (2) anxiety disorders, or (3) obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Patients will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either a telepsychiatry group (at least 50% of visits to be conducted using telemedicine, with at least one face-to-face treatment [FTF] every six months) or an FTF group (all visits to be conducted FTF, with no telemedicine). Both groups will receive the usual treatment covered by public medical insurance. The study will utilize a master protocol design in that there will be primary and secondary outcomes for the entire group regardless of diagnosis, as well as the outcomes for each individual disorder group. Discussion: This study will be a non-inferiority trial to test that the treatment effect of telepsychiatry is not inferior to that of FTF alone.

627463,Comparative Evaluation of Commercially Available Manual and Automated Nucleic Acid Extraction Methods for Rotavirus RNA Detection in Stool,2013-12-01,"BACKGROUND: Transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a worthwhile substitute in patients who might otherwise be inoperable; however, it is applied in <10% of TAVI cases. In patients with established carotid artery stenosis, the risk of complications is increased with the transcarotid access route. CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of concomitant transcarotid TAVI and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in a patient with bovine aortic arch and previous complex infrarenal EndoVascular Aortic Repair (EVAR). The integrity and positioning of the previous EVAR endograft was risked by transfemoral access. The right subclavian artery was only 4.5 mm and the left subclavian was totally occluded so transcarotid access was chosen. The patient recovered well, with no neurological deficit and was discharged home after 72 h. He was last seen and was doing well 6 months post-procedure. DISCUSSION: In patients with severe aortoiliac disease, or previous aortic endografting, transfemoral access for TAVI can be challenging or even prohibitive. Alternative access sites such as transapical or transaortic are associated with added risk because they carry increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, longer intensive care unit and hospital stay, and increased cost. A transcaval approach for TAVI has also been reported but was not suitable for our patient due to prior EVAR. Concomitant TAVI via transcarotid access and CEA can be successful in experienced hands. This case highlights the importance of a team-based approach to complex TAVI cases in high-risk patients with complex vascular access.","Sultan, Sherif; Pate, Gordon; Hynes, Niamh; Mylotte, Darren",Eur Heart J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33447700/,60

This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among HCWs amid the pandemic and their association with religious coping. A cross-sectional study design was applied. The scales utilized were Malay versions of the Brief Religious Coping Scale (Brief RCOPE M) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS M). In total, 200 HCWs were recruited. HCWs scored higher in positive religious coping (mean: 21.33) than negative religious coping (mean: 10.52). The prevalence of anxiety and depression was 36.5% and 29.5%. Both positive and negative religious coping were significantly associated with anxiety (p < 0.01) and depression (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Positive coping predicted reduction in anxiety (adjusted b = −0.15, p = 0.001) and log-transformed depression score (adjusted b = −0.019, p = 0.025). Negative coping predicted increment of anxiety (adjusted b = 0.289, p < 0.001) and log-transformed depression score (adjusted b = 0.052, p < 0.001). Positive religious coping is vital in reducing anxiety and depression among HCWs amid the pandemic.

628246,Mechanism of ligand recognition by human ACE2 receptor,2020-11-01,"INTRODUCTION: Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, intensive care units (ICU) can be overwhelmed by the number of hypoxemic patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This single centre retrospective observational cohort study took place in a French hospital where the number of patients exceeded the ICU capacity despite an increase from 18 to 32 beds. Because of this, 59 (37%) of the 159 patients requiring ICU care were referred to other hospitals. From 27th March to 23rd April, consecutive patients who had respiratory failure or were unable to maintain an SpO2 > 90%, despite receiving 10–15 l/min of oxygen with a non-rebreather mask, were treated by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) unless the ICU physician judged that immediate intubation was indicated. We describe the characteristics, clinical course, and outcomes of these patients. The main outcome under study was CPAP discontinuation. RESULTS: CPAP was initiated in 49 patients and performed out of ICU in 41 (84%). Median age was 65 years (IQR = 54–71) and 36 (73%) were men. Median respiratory rate before CPAP was 36 (30–40) and median SpO2 was 92% (90–95) under 10 to 15 L/min oxygen flow. Median duration of CPAP was 3 days (IQR = 1–5). Reasons for discontinuation of CPAP were: intubation in 25 (51%), improvement in 16 (33%), poor tolerance in 6 (12%) and death in 2 (4%) patients. A decision not to intubate had been taken for 8 patients, including the 2 who died while on CPAP. Two patients underwent less than one hour CPAP for poor tolerance.

629100,Influenza Antiviral Subversion: Now the Host Is in on the Act,2021-03-30,"AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic posed significant challenges to healthcare systems across the globe in 2020. There were concerns surrounding early reports of increased mortality among patients undergoing emergency or non-urgent surgery. We report the morbidity and mortality in patients who underwent arthroplasty procedures during the UK first stage of the pandemic. METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained for a review of prospectively collected data on consecutive patients who underwent arthroplasty procedures between March and May 2020 at a specialist orthopaedic centre in the UK. Data included diagnoses, comorbidities, BMI, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, length of stay, and complications. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality and secondary outcomes were prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, medical and surgical complications, and readmission within 30 days of discharge. The data collated were compared with series from the preceding three months. RESULTS: There were 167 elective procedures performed in the first three weeks of the study period, prior to the first national lockdown, and 57 emergency procedures thereafter. Three patients (1.3%) were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. There was one death (0.45%) due to SARS-CoV-2 infection after an emergency procedure. None of the patients developed complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection after elective arthroplasty. There was no observed spike in complications during in-hospital stay or in the early postoperative period. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between pre-COVID-19 and peri-COVID-19 groups (p = 0.624). We observed a higher number of emergency procedures performed during the pandemic within our institute. CONCLUSION: An international cohort has reported 30-day mortality as 28.8% following orthopaedic procedures during the pandemic. There are currently no reports on clinical outcomes of patients treated with lower limb reconstructive surgery during the same period. While an effective vaccine is developed and widely accepted, it is very likely that SARS-CoV2 infection remains endemic. We believe that this report will help guide future restoration planning here in the UK and abroad.

629737,Targeting N-Glycan Cryptic Sugar Moieties for Broad-Spectrum Virus Neutralization: Progress in Identifying Conserved Molecular Targets in Viruses of Distinct Phylogenetic Origins,2015-03-12,"Semliki Forest virus (SFV) is an arthropod-borne alphavirus that induces membrane invaginations (spherules) in host cells. These harbor the viral replication complexes (RC) that synthesize viral RNA. Alphaviruses have four replicase or nonstructural proteins (nsPs), nsP1–4, expressed as polyprotein P1234. An early RC, which synthesizes minus-strand RNA, is formed by the polyprotein P123 and the polymerase nsP4. Further proteolytic cleavage results in a late RC consisting of nsP1–4 and synthesizing plus strands. Here, we show that only the late RCs are highly active in RNA synthesis in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that active RCs can be isolated from both virus-infected cells and cells transfected with the wild-type replicase in combination with a plasmid expressing a template RNA. When an uncleavable polyprotein P123 and polymerase nsP4 were expressed together with a template, high levels of minus-strand RNA were produced in cells, but RCs isolated from these cells were hardly active in vitro. Furthermore, we observed that the uncleavable polyprotein P123 and polymerase nsP4, which have previously been shown to form spherules even in the absence of the template, did not replicate an exogenous template. Consequently, we hypothesize that the replicase proteins were sequestered in spherules and were no longer able to recruit a template.","Pietilä, Maija K.; Albulescu, Irina C.; van Hemert, Martijn J.; Ahola, Tero",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v9100292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28991178/,60

The aim of this study was to investigate the broad spectrum antiviral activity of a naturally existing sulfated polysaccharide, lambda-carrageenan ({lambda}-CGN), purified from marine red algae. Cell culture-based assays revealed that the macromolecule efficiently inhibited both influenza A and B viruses, as well as currently circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with EC50 values ranging from 0.3-1.4 g/ml. No toxicity to host cells was observed at concentrations up to 300 g/ml. Plaque titration and western blot analysis verified that {lambda}-CGN reduced expression of viral proteins in cell lysates and suppressed progeny virus production in culture supernatants in a dose-dependent manner. This polyanionic compound exerts antiviral activity by targeting viral attachment to cell surface receptors and preventing entry. Moreover, intranasal administration to mice during influenza A viral challenge not only alleviated infection-mediated reductions in body weight but also protected 60% of mice from virus-induced mortality. Thus, {lambda}-CGN could be a promising antiviral agent for preventing infection by several respiratory viruses.","Jang, Ye Jin; Shin, Heegwon; Lee, Myoung Kyu; Kwon, Oh Seung; Shin, Jin Soo; Kim, Yongil; Kim, Meehyein",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.23.255364,60

METHODS: This cross-sectional hospital-based study included patients presenting between March 23, 2020 and April 19, 2020. All patients who presented to the emergency department were included as cases. The data were collected using an electronic medical record system. RESULTS: Overall, 1,192 patients (mean 42.57 per day) presented to the ocular emergency department and were included for analysis. The median age of the patients was 35 (Interquartile range, IQR: 20-52) years and they were mostly adults (77.85%). The majority of patients were male (62.16%) and presented from the local metropolitan region (56.21%). On triaging based on the ocular disorders at presentation, the majority of the patients were emergency related (65.02%), followed by urgent (8.14%) and routine (26.85%) in nature. The most common emergencies were microbial keratitis (23.74%), followed by corneal trauma (16.39%). There was an increasing trend seen in emergency patients (46.11%; week 1 to 71.78%; week 4) and a decreasing trend seen in routine patients (45%; week1 to 21.20%; week 4). A subset of patients (23.49%) underwent surgery where indicated and the most commonly performed procedures were vitreo-retinal procedures (32.86%) followed by trauma related (31.43%). CONCLUSION: The enforcement of the nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19 resulted in a fewer patients presenting to the hospital. The majority of them presented from the local metropolitan region and the common emergencies were microbial keratitis and corneal trauma. About one fourth required a surgical intervention which was most commonly a vitreo-retinal procedure.","Das, Anthony Vipin; Narayanan, Raja",Indian J Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32587174/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_1171_20,60

METHODS: Thirty patients with lung cancer were recruited. Data was collected using a qualitative exploratory design with semi-structured interviews. Transcripts were thematically coded using NVivo software. RESULTS: Five key themes were identified: maintaining resilience, participants acknowledged that they were self-reliant prior to their diagnosis and that the sense of their own internal capabilities was a source of comfort for them; importance of pre-established relationships with healthcare professionals, the sense of connection established prior to the telehealth consultation supported participants to engage with healthcare professionals where the need for connectedness was amplified by a sense of isolation; seeking help, participants sought help from services that they perceived as being “expert”; convenience, factors such as costs and saving time were highlighted; and preferences for consultation type, majority of participants identified physical and emotional comfort being in their own space. For a small number of patients, continuing a face-to-face assessment was important due to expectation based on previous experience.

The psychopathological consequences of the pandemic and quarantine were anticipated to be of particular relevance, especially in patients with psychiatric disorders such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Aim of the present report was to describe the impact of COVID-19 pandemics within a sample of Italian patients affected by OCD. Sociodemographic and clinical variables of a sample of 123 OCD outpatients, currently attending three OCD tertiary clinics in Northern Italy, were assessed through telephone and in-person interviews. Patients showing a clinical worsening of OCD represented more than one third of the sample and reported a significant emergence of new obsessions and compulsions phenotypes along with a significant exacerbation of past ones. Moreover, they were more frequently found to experience suicidal ideation, increased Internet checking, sleep disturbances, avoidance behaviors, and work difficulties. A significantly increased need of therapy adjustment and family accommodation was also observed. Further research is warranted to clarify the potential risk and related consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic on OCD patients.","Benatti, Beatrice; Albert, Umberto; Maina, Giuseppe; Fiorillo, Andrea; Celebre, Laura; Girone, Nicolaja; Fineberg, Naomi; Bramante, Stefano; Rigardetto, Sylvia; Dell’Osso, Bernardo",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32793008/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00720,60

Recent developments in the health status of the population are characterized by continuous improvement in life expectancy, chronic diseases which absorb 90% of total health care expenditure, differences in the causes of mortality (more than 70% mortality from cancer, heart and brain, and external causes). The new trends in health indicators define the current health policies and lead to the necessity of adapting the health system so as to meet the changing health needs of the population. Especially in the context of the changes in the epidemiological spectrum and the variability in the indices of morbidity and mortality, the focus is not only to further prolong life expectancy but also to improve life expectancy without chronic diseases and without disabilities and to reduce the avoidable mortality, the potential years of life lost before the age of 65 years. According to this approach, the main strategic priorities of health policy in the European Union for the period 2014–2020 are: (1) Prevention and health promotion (to combat diseases associated with the modern way of life), (2) Protection from cross-border threats (to address the external impact from cross-border relations, combating epidemics, pandemics), (3) Viability (to address the lack of resources by adopting innovation), (4) Accessibility (to assure the access to medical expertise).Therefore, the key priorities are the prevention of disease and the improvement of life in good health, the patient safety and quality of health services, and the readiness to manage crises and health risks.","Soulis, Sotiris; Sarris, Marcos; Pierrakos, George; Goula, Aspasia; Koutitsas, George; Gkioka, Vasiliki",Cord Blood Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124077850000256; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124077850000256,60

Their genome encodes at least five proteins: large and small tumor antigens and the capsid proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3. The tumor antigens are expressed during early stages of the viral life cycle and are implicated in the regulation of viral transcription and DNA replication, while the capsid proteins are produced later during infection. Members of the Polyomaviridae family have been isolated in birds (Avipolyomavirus) and mammals (Orthopolyomavirus and Wukipolyomavirus). Some mammalian polyomaviruses encode an additional protein, referred to as agnoprotein, which is a relatively small polypeptide that exerts multiple functions.

It is not known to what extent the natural production of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is protective against re-infection. METHODS: A prospective observational study of HCWs in Scotland (UK) from May to September 2020 was performed. The Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay was used to establish seroprevalence in this cohort. Controls, matched for age and sex to the general local population, were studied for comparison. New infections (up to 2 December 2020) post antibody testing were recorded to determine whether the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies protects against re-infection. RESULTS: A total of 2063 health and social care workers were recruited for this study. At enrolment, 300 HCWs had a positive antibody test (14.5%). 11 out of 231 control sera tested positive (4.8%). HCWs therefore had an increased likelihood of a positive test (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.85–6.16; p<0.0001). Dentists were most likely to test positive. 97.3% of patients who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR had positive antibodies. 18.7% had an asymptomatic infection. There were 38 new infections with SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs who were previously antibody negative, and one symptomatic RT-PCR-positive re-infection. The presence of antibodies was therefore associated with an 85% reduced risk of re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 (hazard ratio 0.15, 95% CI 0.06–0.35; p=0.026).

There are currently no FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics for hantavirus-related diseases; however, it is evident that a robust neutralizing antibody response is critical for protection from severe disease. Although virologists first described this family of viruses in the 1950s, there is limited information on the neutralizing epitopes that exist on the hantavirus antigenic glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, and sites important for the design of effective therapeutics and vaccines. We provide a thorough summary of the hantavirus field from an immunological perspective. In particular, we discuss our current structural knowledge of antigenic proteins Gn and Gc, identification of B cell neutralizing epitopes, previously isolated monoclonal antibodies and their cross-reactivity between different hantavirus strains, and current developments toward vaccines and therapeutics. We conclude with some outstanding questions in the field and emphasize the need for additional studies of the human antibody response to hantavirus infection. IMPORTANCE Hantaviruses are pathogens that sometimes pass from animals to humans, and they are found in parts of Europe, Asia, and North and South America. When human infection occurs, these viruses can cause kidney or lung failure, and as many as 40% of infected people die. Currently, there are no vaccines or therapeutics for hantavirus-related diseases available. A first step in developing prevention measures is determining what type of immune response is protective. Increasingly it has become clear that the induction of a type of response called a neutralizing antibody response is critical for protection from severe disease. Although virologists first described this family of viruses in the 1950s, there is limited information on what features on the surface of hantaviruses are recognized by the immune system. Here, we review the current state of knowledge of this information, which is critical for the design of effective therapeutics and vaccines.","Engdahl, Taylor B.; Crowe, James E.",mSphere,https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00482-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32669473/,60

Correctional and detention facilities are at high risk of experiencing outbreaks. We aimed to evaluate cohort-based testing among detained persons exposed to laboratory-confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in order to identify presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases. METHODS: During 1–19 May 2020, 2 testing strategies were implemented in 12 tiers or housing units of the Cook County Jail, Chicago, Illinois. Detained persons were approached to participate in serial testing (n = 137) and offered tests at 3 time points over 14 days (day 1, days 3–5, and days 13–14). The second group was offered a single test and interview at the end of a 14-day quarantine period (day 14 group) (n = 87). RESULTS: 224 detained persons were approached for participation and, of these, 194 (87%) participated in ≥1 interview and 172 (77%) had ≥1 test. Of the 172 tested, 19 were positive for SARS-CoV-2. In the serial testing group, 17 (89%) new cases were detected, 16 (84%) on day 1, 1 (5%) on days 3–5, and none on days 13–14; in the day 14 group, 2 (11%) cases were identified. More than half (12/19; 63%) of the newly identified cases were presymptomatic or asymptomatic.

635424,An overview of the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus,2013-01-16,"In recent years, there has been a scholarly debate regarding the decrease in automobile-related mobility indicators (car ownership, driving license holding, VMT, etc.). Broadly speaking, two theories have been put forward to explain this trend: (1) economic factors whose impacts are well-understood in principle, but whose occurrence among young adults as a demographic sub-group had been overlooked, and (2) less well-understood shifts in cultural mores, values and sentiment towards the automobile. This second theory is devilishly difficult to study, due primarily to limitations in standard data resources such as the National Household Travel Survey and international peer datasets. In this study we first compiled a database of lyrics to popular music songs from 1956 to 2015 (defined by inclusion in the annual “top 40”), and subsequently identified references to automobiles within this corpus. We then evaluated whether there is support for theory #2 above within popular music, by looking at changes from the 1950s to the 2010s. We demonstrate that the frequency of references to automobility tended for many years to increase over time, however there has more recently been a decline after the late 2000s (decade). In terms of the sentiment of popular music lyrics that reference automobiles, our results are mixed as to whether the references are becoming increasingly positive or negative (machine analysis suggests increasing negativity, while human analysis did not find a significant association), however a consistent observation is that sentiment of automobile references have over time become more positive relative to sentiment of song lyrics overall. We also show that sentiment towards automobile references differs systematically by genre, e.g. automobile references within ‘Rock’ lyrics are in general more negative than similar references to cars in other music genres).

The pathogen etiology in regard of viral loads has never been investigated. In a prospective cohort study we investigated the correlation between virus type and quantity in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) and the clinical characteristics in pediatric patients with a FS. From January 2014 to April 2016, 184 children with a FS were prospectively enrolled. The mean age of all included children was 26.7 ± 18.3 months with a male to female ratio of 1.4:1. Males with an acute disease and a short duration or absence of prior symptoms had a higher risk for complex FS. The majority of patients with FS presented with a generalized convulsion (180; 98%) and was admitted to hospital (178; 97%). Overall, 79 (43%) single and in 59 (32%) co-infections were detected. Human herpes virus 6 (HHV6), influenza, adenovirus (AV) and rhinovirus (RV) were the dominant pathogens, all detected with clinically significant high viral loads. HHV6 positive cases were significantly younger and less likely to have a positive family/personal history for FS. Influenza positives showed a higher rate of complex seizures, lower leukocyte and higher monocyte counts. AV positive cases were more likely to have a positive family history for FS and showed higher C-reactive protein values.

636311,Immunoinformatics Approach for the Identification and Characterization of T Cell and B Cell Epitopes towards the Peptide-Based Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2,2021-01-29,"Emerging highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (CoVs) represent a serious ongoing threat to the public health worldwide. The spike (S) proteins of CoVs are surface glycoproteins that facilitate viral entry into host cells via attachment to their respective cellular receptors. The S protein is believed to be a major immunogenic component of CoVs and a target for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and most candidate vaccines. Development of a safe and convenient assay is thus urgently needed to determine the prevalence of CoVs nAbs in the population, to study immune response in infected individuals, and to aid in vaccines and viral entry inhibitor evaluation. While live virus-based neutralization assays are used as gold standard serological methods to detect and measure nAbs, handling of highly pathogenic live CoVs requires strict bio-containment conditions in biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) laboratories. On the other hand, use of replication-incompetent pseudoviruses bearing CoVs S proteins could represent a safe and useful method to detect nAbs in serum samples under biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) conditions. Here, we describe a detailed protocol of a safe and convenient assay to generate vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudoviruses to evaluate and measure nAbs against highly pathogenic CoVs. The protocol covers methods to produce VSV pseudovirus bearing the S protein of the Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), pseudovirus titration, and pseudovirus neutralization assay. Such assay could be adapted by different laboratories and researchers working on highly pathogenic CoVs without the need to handle live viruses in the BSL-3 environment.","Almahboub, Sarah A.; Algaissi, Abdullah; Alfaleh, Mohamed A.; ElAssouli, M-Zaki; Hashem, Anwar M.",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.02020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33013745/,60
636782,Inhibitory effect of silver nanomaterials on transmissible virus-induced host cell infections,2014-02-10,"The COVID-19 crisis has taken a significant toll on human life and the global economy since its start in early 2020. Healthcare professionals have been particularly vulnerable because of the unprecedented shortage of Facepiece Respirators (FPRs), which act as fundamental tools to protect the medical staff treating the coronavirus patients. In addition, many FPRs are designed to be disposable single-use devices, creating an issue related to the generation of large quantities of non-biodegradable waste. In this contribution, we describe a plasma-based decontamination technique designed to circumvent the shortages of FPRs and alleviate the environmental problems posed by waste generation. The system utilizes a Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) to generate ozone and feed it through the fibers of the FPRs. The flow-through configuration is different than canonical ozone-based sterilization methods, in which the equipment is placed in a sealed ozone-containing enclosure without any flow through the mask polymer fibers. We demonstrate the rapid decontamination of surgical masks using Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) as model pathogens, with the flow-through configuration providing a drastic reduction in sterilization time compared to the canonical approach. We also demonstrate that there is no deterioration in mask structure or filtration efficiency resulting from sterilization. Finally, we show that this decontamination approach can be implemented using readily available tools, such as a plastic box, a glass tube, few 3D printed components, and the high-voltage power supply from a plasma globe toy. The prototype assembled for this study is portable and affordable, with effectiveness comparable to that of larger and more expensive equipment.","Schwan, Joseph; Alva, Troy R.; Nava, Giorgio; Rodriguez, Carla Berrospe; Dunn, Zachary Spencer; Chartron, Justin W.; Morgan, Joshua; Wang, Pin; Mangolini, Lorenzo",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91735-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34112900/,60

Despite the rapid growth of scientific publications about medical aspects of the pandemic, less has been explored about the effects of media communication regarding COVID-19 on healthy behaviors. Yet, the scientific literature has widely debated on how media can influence people’s health-related evaluations, emotions, and behaviors. To fill this gap, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between media exposure, people’s attitudes and emotions toward media contents, and healthy behaviors related to the use of public spaces, such as avoiding crowded places, wearing face masks, and maintaining social distance. A questionnaire referring to these variables was administered to an opportunistic sample of 174 participants in Italy during the off-peak period of the COVID-19 outbreak and before restrictions to mobility were extended to the whole country. Results showed that media exposure, the perception of social initiatives of prevention, and moderate levels of fear increase healthier behaviors in the use of public spaces. Perceiving alarming information did not significantly predict healthy behaviors in the use of public spaces. Results are discussed with reference to the previous literature. Suggestions to media communication to increase preventive behaviors during emergencies are also provided.","Scopelliti, Massimiliano; Pacilli, Maria Giuseppina; Aquino, Antonio",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33671977/,60

640766,Predicted structural mimicry of spike receptor-binding motifs from highly pathogenic human coronaviruses,2021-07-02,"BACKGROUND: Older adults, including those with long-term conditions (LTCs), are vulnerable to social isolation. They are likely to have become more socially isolated during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, often due to advice to “shield” to protect them from infection. This places them at particular risk of depression and loneliness. There is a need for brief scalable psychosocial interventions to mitigate the psychological impacts of social isolation. Behavioural activation (BA) is a credible candidate intervention, but a trial is needed. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We undertook an external pilot parallel randomised trial (ISRCTN94091479) designed to test recruitment, retention and engagement with, and the acceptability and preliminary effects of the intervention. Participants aged ≥65 years with 2 or more LTCs were recruited in primary care and randomised by computer and with concealed allocation between June and October 2020. BA was offered to intervention participants (n = 47), and control participants received usual primary care (n = 49). Assessment of outcome was made blind to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was depression severity (measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)). We also measured health-related quality of life (measured by the Short Form (SF)-12v2 mental component scale (MCS) and physical component scale (PCS)), anxiety (measured by the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7)), perceived social and emotional loneliness (measured by the De Jong Gierveld Scale: 11-item loneliness scale). Outcome was measured at 1 and 3 months. The mean age of participants was aged 74 years (standard deviation (SD) 5.5) and they were mostly White (n = 92, 95.8%), and approximately two-thirds of the sample were female (n = 59, 61.5%). Remote recruitment was possible, and 45/47 (95.7%) randomised to the intervention completed 1 or more sessions (median 6 sessions) out of 8. A total of 90 (93.8%) completed the 1-month follow-up, and 86 (89.6%) completed the 3-month follow-up, with similar rates for control (1 month: 45/49 and 3 months 44/49) and intervention (1 month: 45/47and 3 months: 42/47) follow-up. Between-group comparisons were made using a confidence interval (CI) approach, and by adjusting for the covariate of interest at baseline. At 1 month (the primary clinical outcome point), the median number of completed sessions for people receiving the BA intervention was 3, and almost all participants were still receiving the BA intervention. The between-group comparison for the primary clinical outcome at 1 month was an adjusted between-group mean difference of −0.50 PHQ-9 points (95% CI −2.01 to 1.01), but only a small number of participants had completed the intervention at this point. At 3 months, the PHQ-9 adjusted mean difference (AMD) was 0.19 (95% CI −1.36 to 1.75). When we examined loneliness, the adjusted between-group difference in the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale at 1 month was 0.28 (95% CI −0.51 to 1.06) and at 3 months −0.87 (95% CI −1.56 to −0.18), suggesting evidence of benefit of the intervention at this time point. For anxiety, the GAD adjusted between-group difference at 1 month was 0.20 (−1.33, 1.73) and at 3 months 0.31 (−1.08, 1.70). For the SF-12 (physical component score), the adjusted between-group difference at 1 month was 0.34 (−4.17, 4.85) and at 3 months 0.11 (−4.46, 4.67). For the SF-12 (mental component score), the adjusted between-group difference at 1 month was 1.91 (−2.64, 5.15) and at 3 months 1.26 (−2.64, 5.15). Participants who withdrew had minimal depressive symptoms at entry. There were no adverse events. The Behavioural Activation in Social Isolation (BASIL) study had 2 main limitations. First, we found that the intervention was still being delivered at the prespecified primary outcome point, and this fed into the design of the main trial where a primary outcome of 3 months is now collected. Second, this was a pilot trial and was not designed to test between-group differences with high levels of statistical power. Type 2 errors are likely to have occurred, and a larger trial is now underway to test for robust effects and replicate signals of effectiveness in important secondary outcomes such as loneliness. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that BA is a credible intervention to mitigate the psychological impacts of COVID-19 isolation for older adults. We demonstrated that it is feasible to undertake a trial of BA. The intervention can be delivered remotely and at scale, but should be reserved for older adults with evidence of depressive symptoms. The significant reduction in loneliness is unlikely to be a chance finding, and replication will be explored in a fully powered randomised controlled trial (RCT).

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to 1) determine the extent of disruption in provision and utilization of health and nutrition services induced by the pandemic in Uttar Pradesh, India; and 2) identify how adaptations were made to restore service provision in response to the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted longitudinal surveys with frontline workers (FLWs, n = 313) and mothers of children <2 y old (n = 659) in December 2019 (in-person) and July 2020 (by phone). We also interviewed block-level managers and obtained administrative data. We examined changes in service provision and utilization using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests. RESULTS: Compared with prepandemic, service provision reduced substantially during lockdown (83–98 percentage points, pp), except for home visits and take-home rations (∼30%). Most FLWs (68%–90%) restored service provision in July 2020, except for immunization and hot cooked meals (<10%). Administrative data showed similar patterns of disruption and restoration. FLW fears, increased workload, inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE), and manpower shortages challenged service provision. Key adaptations made to provide services were delivering services to beneficiary homes (∼40%–90%), social distancing (80%), and using PPE (40%–50%) and telephones for communication (∼20%). On the demand side, service utilization reduced substantially (40–80 pp) during the lockdown, but about half of mothers received home visits and food supplementation. Utilization for most services did not improve after the lockdown, bearing the challenges of limited travel (30%), nonavailability of services (26%), and fear of catching the virus when leaving the house (22%) or meeting service providers (14%). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 disrupted the provision and use of health and nutrition services in Uttar Pradesh, India, despite adaptations to restore services.

642643,Automatic Identification of SARS Coronavirus using Compression-Complexity Measures,2020-03-27,"Study Objectives: Altered mental status (AMS) is frequently associated with poor outcomes across a wide spectrum of conditions including infections. This study aims to identify whether AMS in emergency department (ED) patients with COVID-19 is independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Methods: This was a retrospective multicenter cohort study. We included all patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR within 2 weeks of presentation, who were admitted from the ED of three hospitals in the greater Boston area between March and August 2020. The primary covariate of interest was ED AMS at ED arrival and the primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The ED charts were abstracted for demographics, comorbid conditions, symptoms, laboratory testing, and radiology testing along with in-hospital outcomes. AMS was defined by documentation of changes in mental status from baseline. We used logistic regression modeling with backwards elimination to determine an adjusted estimate for the independent association of AMS with mortality. Results: We included 824 visits with 51% male, a mean age was 67.1 (SD 17.0) and 153 (18.6%) had AMS. There were 132 deaths for an overall mortality rate of 16.1%. Patients with AMS had in-hospital mortality of 38.2% (95% CI 30.4%-46.4%), compared to 11.1% (8.8%-13.7%) for patients without AMS (p<0.0001). After adjusting for potential confounders, visits by patients with AMS during their stay at the ED had 3.1 (95% CI, 2.1-5.9) times the odds of death compared to those without AMS. Conclusion: Among patients with COVID-19, AMS in the ED was associated with three-fold increase in mortality compared to patients without AMS.","Olesen, T. W.; Tyler, P. D.; Lassen, A.

Production of SARS Coronavirus-Like Particles That Bind Host Cells and Serve as Vaccine Antigen,2005-05-31,"Biomimetics is an interdisciplinary field of science that deals with the analysis and systematic transfer of biological insights into technical applications. Moreover, the development of biomimetic products helps to improve our understanding of biological concept generators (reverse biomimetics). What does this mean for the education of kindergarten children, pupils, students, teachers, and others interested in biomimetics? The challenge of biomimetics is to have a solid knowledge base in the scientific disciplines involved and the competency to be open-minded enough to develop innovative solutions. This apparently contradictory combination ensures the transfer of knowledge from biology to engineering and vice versa on the basis of a common language that is perfectly understandable to everyone, e.g., the language of models, algorithms, and complete mathematical formulations. The opportunity within biomimetics is its ability to arouse student interest in technology via the fascination inherent in biological solutions and to awaken enthusiasm for living nature via the understanding of technology. Collaboration in working groups promotes professional, social, and personal skills. The variety of biomimetics is mirrored by the large number of educational modules developed with respect to existing biomimetic products and methods.","Speck, Olga; Speck, Thomas",Biomimetics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34449558/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomimetics6030049,60
643671,Engineering Infectious cDNAs of Coronavirus as Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes,2007-11-28,"The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 infection has had an unimaginable impact on health systems worldwide. Cardiorespiratory arrest remains a potentially reversible medical emergency that requires the performance of a set of maneuvers designed to replace and restore spontaneous breathing and circulation. Suspending cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) usually corresponds to an ethical-clinical dilemma that the health professional in charge must assume. The “Lazarus phenomenon” is an unusual syndrome with a difficult pathophysiological explanation, defined as the spontaneous return of circulation in the absence of any life support technique or after the cessation of failed CPR maneuvers. We present the case of a 79-year-old patient hospitalized in the intensive care unit for septic shock of pulmonary origin associated with COVID-19 infection who presented cardiorespiratory arrest that required unsuccessful resuscitation maneuvers for 40 minutes, declared deceased. After 20 minutes of death, he presented a return to spontaneous circulation. The pathophysiological changes of the Lazarus phenomenon remind us of the limitations we have in determining when to end cardiopulmonary resuscitation and that its interruption must be approached with more caution, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Martinez-Ávila, Maria Cristina; Almanza Hurtado, Amilkar; Trespalacios Sierra, Alvano; Rodriguez Yanez, Tómas; Dueñas-Castell, Carmelo",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34527476/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17089,60

Besides impacts of habitat changes caused by current rates of land conversion, climatic influences or predators, a contribution of infectious pathogens needs also to be considered. Infectious and non-infectious diseases in free-living populations of ring-necked pheasants have been scarcely investigated so far. In the present study, carcasses of 258 deceased free-ranging pheasants of different age groups, predominantly adult pheasants, collected over a period of 4 years in the states of Lower Saxony, North Rhine–Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein, were examined pathomorphologically, parasitologically, virologically and bacteriologically, with a focus set on infectious pathogens. A periocular and perinasal dermatitis of unknown origin was present in 62.3% of the pheasants. Additional alterations included protozoal cysts in the skeletal musculature (19.0%), hepatitis (21.7%), enteritis (18.7%), gastritis (12.6%), and pneumonia (11.7%). In single cases, neoplasms (2.6%) and mycobacteriosis (1.7%) occurred. Further findings included identification of coronaviral DNA from trachea or caecal tonsils (16.8%), siadenoviral DNA (7.6%), avian metapneumoviral RNA (6.6%), and infectious bursal disease viral RNA (3.7%). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on herpesvirus, avian influenza virus (AIV), paramyxovirus type 1 (PMV-1), avian encephalomyelitis virus (AEV), and chlamydia were negative. Based on the present results, there is no indication of a specific pathogen as a sole cause for population decline in adult pheasants. However, an infectious disease can still not be completely excluded as it may only affect reproduction effectivity or a certain age group of pheasants (e.g., chicks) which were not presented in the study.","Curland, N.; Gethöffer, F.; van Neer, A.; Ziegler, L.; Heffels-Redmann, U.; Lierz, M.; Baumgärtner, W.; Wohlsein, P.; Völker, I.; Lapp, S.; Bello, A.; Pfankuche, V.

Individual-based models (IBM) simulating the spread of infection in a population have a few advantages compared to classical equation-based approach. First, they use individuals as units, which represent the population, and reflect the local variations happening in real life. Second, the simplicity of modelling the interactions between the individuals, which may not be the case when using differential equations. We propose to use freely available population density maps to simulate the infection spread in the human population on the scale of an individual country or a city. We explore the effect of social distancing and show that it can reduce the outbreak when applied before or during peak time, but it can also inflict the second wave when relaxed after the peak. This can be explained by a large proportion of susceptible individuals, even in the large cities, after the first wave. The model can be adapted to any spatial scale from a single hospital to multiple countries.","Mashanov, Gregory I; Mashanova, Alla",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.24.20077289v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.20077289,60

The surgical technique and associated complications are also detailed. STUDY DESIGN: Observational and historical cohort. SETTING: Single center. METHODS: Eighty-three intubated COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Thirty bedside surgical tracheostomies had been performed following our safety protocol. RESULTS: Data from 83 patients admitted to the ICU in Infanta Leonor University Hospital were collected; 74.7% were male. The average age was 59.7 years. The main comorbidities found were hypertension in 51.8%, diabetes mellitus in 25.3%, asthma in 7.2%, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 3.6%. A surgical tracheostomy was carried out in 36.1% of patients who needed a prolonged intubation. The most frequent complication of the surgical procedure, bleeding, occurred in 30%, but the majority were mild and ceased with compression only. The most relevant complication was local infection, which occurred in 26.7% of patients. There were statistically significant differences in the time from the beginning of mechanical ventilation until weaning between tracheostomized and nontracheostomized patients. The mortality rate of patients who underwent tracheostomy was 56.7%. Despite severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 being highly contagious and tracheostomy being considered a high-risk procedure, our rate of infected ear, nose, and throat specialists was only 11.8%. CONCLUSION: In our experience, bedside surgical tracheostomy is a safe procedure in COVID-19 patients when safety protocols are followed.","Zuazua-Gonzalez, Alejandro; Collazo-Lorduy, Teresa; Coello-Casariego, Guadalupe; Collazo-Lorduy, Ana; Leon-Soriano, Elena; Torralba-Moron, Angel; Onrubia-Parra, Tomas; Gomez-Martin-Zarco, Jose-M; Echarri-SanMartin, Rosa; Ripolles-Melchor, Javier; Martinez-De-la-Gandara, Amalia; Domingo-Carrasco, Carlos",OTO Open,https://doi.org/10.1177/2473974x20957636; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32974425/,60

This presumes demand for international tourism can be influenced by “wealth effects” from real estate and financial assets. This study tested for the wealth effect on Korean outbound travelers during the 20 years between 1989 and 2009. Korea is a unique place to examine in that Korean households possess housing assets and financial assets that are traded actively in markets. The results of this study favored the possibility of a significant wealth effect from housing on outbound travel demand, but not from financial assets. This may be explained by data sensitivity and the relative importance of financial assets in the Korean people's wealth portfolios.

This paper argues that public policy decisions on how and if to implement decision-making processes based on machine learning and AI for public use are such decisions. Decisions on public policy on AI are uncertain due to three features specific to the current landscape of AI, namely (i) the vagueness of the definition of AI, (ii) uncertain outcomes of AI implementations and (iii) pacing problems. Given that many potential applications of AI in the public sector concern functions central to the public sphere, decisions on the implementation of such applications are particularly sensitive. Therefore, it is suggested that public policy-makers and decision-makers in the public sector can adopt strategies from the argumentative approach in decision theory to mitigate the established great uncertainty. In particular, the notions of framing and temporal strategies are considered.","Nordström, Maria",AI Soc,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-021-01263-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511737/,60

The participants (N = 44, M(age) = 31.93, SD = 8.09) were Greek adults who attended a 2-week, voluntary, online group intervention. To assess the effectiveness of the intervention, 1 week before and 1 week after implementation, participants completed several questionnaires measuring their demographic characteristics, empathy, resilience, affectivity, feelings of loneliness, depression and anxiety levels, and feelings of fear regarding the outbreak. One week after the intervention, they also completed two questionnaires evaluating the therapeutic factors and their satisfaction and impressions regarding telemental health counseling. Analyses showed that the most frequently cited therapeutic factor was guidance, followed by acceptance, self-disclosure, universality, and instillation of hope. Therapeutic factors of catharsis, self-disclosure, guidance, self-understanding, vicarious learning, and therapeutic alliance correlated with elements of empathy, resilience, loneliness, positive emotions, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and fear of the coronavirus. Satisfaction with the online format of the intervention was associated to universality, elements of empathy, and symptoms of depression. More specifically, member satisfaction was negatively correlated with improvement in personal distress and depression, an unexpected finding that may be attributed to the brief duration of the present intervention.

Although early therapies such as prophylactic antibodies and vaccines show great promise, there are concerns about the long-term efficacy and universal applicability of these therapies as the virus continues to mutate. Thus, protein-based immunogens that can quickly respond to viral changes remain of continued interest. The Spike protein, the main immunogen of this virus, displays a highly dynamic trimeric structure that presents a challenge for therapeutic development. Here, guided by the structure of the Spike trimer, we rationally design new Spike constructs that show a uniquely high stability profile while simultaneously remaining locked into the immunogen-desirable prefusion state. Furthermore, our approach emphasizes the relationship between the highly conserved S2 region and structurally dynamic Receptor Binding Domains (RBD) to enable vaccine development as well as the generation of antibodies able to resist viral mutation.","Riley, Timothy P.; Chou, Hui-Ting; Hu, Ruozhen; Bzymek, Krzysztof P.; Correia, Ana R.; Partin, Alexander C.; Li, Danqing; Gong, Danyang; Wang, Zhulun; Yu, Xinchao; Manzanillo, Paolo; Garces, Fernando",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.660198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33968063/,60

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort of patients with COVID-19 seen from 3 March to 29 October 2020. We described the distribution of underlying comorbidities, quality of care metrics, demographic and social determinants of health (SDOH) indicators across race groups. We also described clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients including length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, readmission and mortality. We performed multivariable analyses for hospitalisation risk among all patients with COVID-19 and stratifyied by race and sex. SETTING: KPGA, an integrated healthcare system. PARTICIPANTS: 5712 patients who all had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Of them, 57.8% were female, 58.4% black, 29.5% white, 8.5% Hispanic and 3.6% Asian. RESULTS: Black patients had the highest proportions of living in neighborhoods under the federal poverty line (12.4%) and in more deprived locations (neighbourhood deprivation index=0.4). Overall, 14.4% (n=827) of this cohort was hospitalised. Asian patients had the highest rates of ICU admission (53.1%) and mechanical ventilation (21.9%). Among all patients, Hispanics (adjusted 1.60, 95% CI (1.08, 2.37)), blacks (1.43 (1.13, 1.83)), age in years (1.03 (1.02, 1.04)) and living in a zip code with high unemployment (1.08 (1.03, 1.13)) were associated with higher odds of hospitalisation. COVID-19 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2.59 (1.67, 4.02)), chronic heart failure (1.79 (1.31, 2.45)), immunocompromised (1.77 (1.16, 2.70)), with glycated haemoglobin >8% (1.68 (1.19, 2.38)), depression (1.60 (1.24, 2.06)), hypertension (1.5 (1.21, 1.87)) and physical inactivity (1.25 (1.03, 1.51)) had higher odds of hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: Black and Hispanic KPGA patients were at higher odds of hospitalisation, but not mortality, compared with other race groups.

650930,Characterisation of cyclin D1 down-regulation in coronavirus infected cells,2007-04-03,"INTRODUCTION: Up to fifteen percent of patients with novel pandemic coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have acute respiratory failure (ARF). Ratio between arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), P/F, is currently used as a marker of ARF severity in Covid-19. P/F does not reflect the respiratory efforts made by patients to maintain arterial blood oxygenation, such as tachypnea and hyperpnea, leading to hypocapnia. Standard PaO2, the value of PaO2 adjusted for arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of the subject, better reflects the pathophysiology of hypoxemic ARF. We hypothesized that the ratio between standard PaO2 over FiO2 (STP/F) better predicts Covid-19 ARF severity compared to P/F. METHODS: Aim of this pilot prospectic observational study was to observe differences between STP/F and P/F in predicting outcome failure, defined as need of invasive mechanical ventilation and/or deaths in Covid-19 ARF. Accuracy was calculated using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis and areas under the ROC curve (AUROC) were compared. RESULTS: 349 consecutive subjects admitted to our respiratory wards due to Covid-19 ARF were enrolled. STP/F was accurate to predict mortality and superior to P/F with, respectively, AUROC 0.710 versus 0.688, p = 0.012.Both STP/F and PF were accurate to predict outcome failure (AUROC respectively of 0.747 and 0.742, p = 0.590). DISCUSSION: This is the first study assessing the role of STP/F in describing severity of ARF in Covid-19. According to results, STP/F is accurate and superior to P/F in predicting in-hospital mortality.","Prediletto, Irene; D'Antoni, Letizia; Carbonara, Paolo; Daniele, Federico; Dongilli, Roberto; Flore, Roberto; Pacilli, Angela Maria Grazia; Pisani, Lara; Tomsa, Corina; Vega, María Laura; Ranieri, Vito Marco; Nava, Stefano; Palange, Paolo",Eur J Intern Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0953620521002016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0953620521002016; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2021.06.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34175182/,60

Initial pulmonary failure does not exhibit classical features of ARDS; hypercoagulability is a common laboratory feature, and pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy has been reported post mortem1,2,3. Biomarkers cannot robustly identify such patients pre-emptively and no specific interventions exist to mitigate clinical deterioration. Mononuclear phagocytic cells are key immune cells and bind fibrinogen through the CD11b/CD18 dimer CR3, whose activated form can initiate microthrombus formation.

We aimed to describe patients’ demographic characteristics and COVID-19 disease outcomes in Portuguese cancer patients. We conducted a retrospective study in a cohort of cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19. A total of 127 individuals were included: 46.5% males and 53.5% females, with a median age of 72 years. Clinicopathological characteristics were used in univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses to estimate odds ratios for each variable with outcomes adjusting for potential confounders. Our cohort revealed that 84.3% of patients had more than one risk factor for severe disease rather than cancer. In total, 36.2% of patients were admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine, 14.2% developed severe disease, 1.6% required Intensive Care Unit, and mortality was observed in 11.8%. Severe COVID-19 disease was associated with unfit (ECOG PS > 2) patients (p = 0.009; OR = 6.39; 95% CI: 1.60–25.59), chronic kidney disease (p = 0.004; OR = 20.7; 95% CI: 2.64–162.8), immunosuppression (p < 0.001; OR = 10.3; 95% CI: 2.58–41.2), and presence of respiratory symptoms at diagnosis (p = 0.033; OR = 5.05; 95% CI: 1.14–22.4).

The old model explaining subgenomic mRNA synthesis, which was called leader-primed transcription, was based on erroneous evidence that only genome-length negative strands were present in replicative intermediates. To explain the discovery of subgenome-length minus strands, a related model, called the replicon model, was proposed: The subgenomic mRNAs would be produced initially by leader-primed transcription and then replicated into minus-strand templates that would in turn be transcribed into subgenomic mRNAs. We review the experimental evidence that led us to formulate a third model proposing that the discontinuous event in coronavirus RNA synthesis occurs during minus strand synthesis. With our model the genome is copied both continuously to produce minus-strand templates for genome RNA synthesis and discontinuously to produce minus-strand templates for subgenomic mRNA synthesis, and the subgenomic mRNAs do not function as templates for minus strand synthesis, only the genome does.","Sawicki, S.

654078,A Neutralizing Human Monoclonal Antibody Protects against Lethal Disease in a New Ferret Model of Acute Nipah Virus Infection,2009-10-30,"Fentanyl is now the primary driver of the current opioid crisis. Fentanyl and its analogues are subject to the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, the Controlled Substances Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986 (Federal Analogue Act), state laws, international treaties, and the laws of foreign countries. The appearance of novel psychoactive substances led to further legislative developments in scheduling. New fentanyl analogues proliferated in a manner previously unseen since about 2016. Overdose deaths of these fentanyl analogues prompted the Drug Enforcement Administration to reactively emergency schedule each new fentanyl analogue as it appeared. The international community also acted. Finally, on February 6, 2018, a proactive temporary (emergency) class‐wide scheduling of fentanyl‐related substances was implemented based upon the fentanyl core structure to save lives. This action spurred a similar action in China. Fentanyl analogues fell dramatically in the marketplace, despite further increases in fentanyl itself. Congress temporarily extended this scheduling, but it will soon expire. Opposition to permanent class‐wide was lodged due to concerns over law enforcement overreach, inadequate Health and Human Services input, and hindrance of research. This paper reaffirms the importance of a class‐based scheduling strategy while also arguing for increased research of schedule I controlled substances.","Weedn, Victor W.; Elizabeth Zaney, Mary; McCord, Bruce; Lurie, Ira; Baker, Andrew",J Forensic Sci,https://doi.org/10.1111/1556-4029.14712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33951192/,60
654539,Tetraspanins: Architects of Viral Entry and Exit Platforms,2018-12-19,"INTRODUCTION: Immersive Virtual Reality (iVR) is a novel technology which can enhance surgical training in a virtual environment without supervision. However, it is untested for the training to select, assemble and deliver instrumentation in orthopaedic surgery—typically performed by scrub nurses. This study investigates the impact of an iVR curriculum on this facet of the technically demanding revision total knee arthroplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten scrub nurses completed training in four iVR sessions over a 4-week period. Initially, nurses completed a baseline real-world assessment, performing their role with real equipment in a simulated operation assessment. Each subsequent iVR session involved a guided mode, where the software taught participants the procedural choreography and assembly of instrumentation in a simulated operating room. In the latter three sessions, nurses also undertook an assessment in iVR. Outcome measures were related to procedural sequence, duration of surgery and efficiency of movement. Transfer of skills from iVR to the real world was assessed in a post-training simulated operation assessment. A pre- and post-training questionnaire assessed the participants knowledge, confidence and anxiety. RESULTS: Operative time reduced by an average of 47% across the 3 unguided sessions (mean 55.5 ± 17.6 min to 29.3 ± 12.1 min, p > 0.001). Assistive prompts reduced by 75% (34.1 ± 16.8 to 8.6 ± 8.8, p < 0.001), dominant hand motion by 28% (881.3 ± 178.5 m to 643.3 ± 119.8 m, p < 0.001) and head motion by 36% (459.9 ± 99.7 m to 292.6 ± 85.3 m, p < 0.001). Real-world skill improved from 11% prior to iVR training to 84% correct post-training. Participants reported increased confidence and reduced anxiety in scrubbing for rTKA procedures (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: For scrub nurses, unfamiliarity with complex surgical procedures or equipment is common. Immersive VR training improved their understanding, technical skills and efficiency. These iVR-learnt skills transferred into the real world.","Edwards, Thomas C.; Patel, Arjun; Szyszka, Bartosz; Coombs, Alexander W.; Liddle, Alexander D.; Kucheria, Rakesh; Cobb, Justin P.; Logishetty, Kartik",Arch Orthop Trauma Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34319473/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00402-021-04050-4,60

In this study, multi-omics and systems pharmacology analyses were performed to unravel the multi-targeted mechanisms of novel bioactives to combat COVID-19. Immuno-transcriptomic dataset of healthy controls and COVID-19 cases was retrieved from ArrayExpress. Phytocompounds from ethnobotanical plants were collected from PubChem. Differentially expressed 98 immune genes associated with COVID-19 were derived through NetworkAnalyst 3.0. Among 259 plant derived compounds, 154 compounds were targeting 13 COVID-19 immune genes involved in diverse signaling pathways. In addition, pharmacological properties of these phytocompounds were compared with COVID-19 drugs prescribed by WHO, and 25 novel phytocompounds were found to be more efficient with higher bioactive scores. The current study unravels the virogenomic signatures which can serve as therapeutic targets and identified phytocompounds with anti-COVID-19 efficacy.

These diseases threaten the lives of many people and cause serious social and economic losses. Recent developments in information technology (IT) and connectivity have led to the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in many industries. These industries, where IoT and AI together are making significant impacts, are the healthcare and the diagnosis department. In addition, by actively communicating with smart devices and various biometric sensors, it is expanding its application fields to telemedicine, healthcare, and disease prevention. Even though existing IoT and AI technologies can enhance disease detection, monitoring, and quarantine, their impact is very limited because they are not integrated or applied rapidly to the emergence of a sudden epidemic. Especially in the situation where infectious diseases are rapidly spreading, the conventional methods fail to prevent large-scale infections and block global spreads through prediction, resulting in great loss of lives. Therefore, in this paper, various sources of infection information with local limitations are collected through virus disease information collector, and AI analysis and severity matching are performed through AI broker. Finally, through the Integrated Disease Control Center, risk alerts are issued, proliferation block letters are sent, and post-response services are provided quickly. Suppose we further develop the proposed integrated virus disease control model. In that case, it will be possible to proactively detect and warn of risk factors in response to infectious diseases that are rapidly spreading worldwide and strengthen measures to prevent spreading of infection in no time.","Sim, Sungho; Cho, Myeongyun",Pers Ubiquitous Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34121979/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00779-021-01577-6,60

No specific antiviral treatments or vaccines are currently available. A recent study has reported that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), the disease caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, is associated with neutrophil‐specific plasma membrane rupture, and release excessive neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and extracellular DNAs (eDNAs). This mechanism involves the activation of NETosis, a neutrophil‐specific programmed cell death, which is believed to play a crucial role in COVID‐19 pathogenesis. Further progression of the disease can cause uncontrolled inflammation, leading to the initiation of cytokine storms, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis. Herein, it is reported that DNase‐I‐coated melanin‐like nanospheres (DNase‐I pMNSs) mitigate sepsis‐associated NETosis dysregulation, thereby preventing further progression of the disease. Recombinant DNase‐I and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) are used as coatings to promote the lengthy circulation and dissolution of NET structure. The data indicate that the application of bioinspired DNase‐I pMNSs reduce neutrophil counts and NETosis‐related factors in the plasma of SARS‐CoV‐2 sepsis patients, alleviates systemic inflammation, and attenuates mortality in a septic mouse model. Altogether, the findings suggest that these nanoparticles have potential applications in the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2‐related illnesses and other beta‐CoV‐related diseases.","Park, Hee Ho; Park, Wooram; Lee, Yun Young; Kim, Hyelim; Seo, Hee Seung; Choi, Dong Wook; Kwon, Ho‐Keun; Na, Dong Hee; Kim, Tae‐Hyung; Choy, Young Bin; Ahn, June Hong; Lee, Wonhwa; Park, Chun Gwon",Adv Sci (Weinh),https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202001940; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173718/,60

Temporarily closing schools and other educational institutions has been adopted in many countries, including Saudi Arabia. This study aimed to assess academic staff satisfaction with suspending face-to-face teaching and turning to web-based education. Additionally, this study assessed how the suspension of face-to-face classes has affected the administrative work, research, and community at the College of Pharmacy, King Khalid University. METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional, self-administered, anonymous online questionnaire. A total of 59 academic staff were included. RESULTS: More than half the participants (55.9%) agreed or strongly agreed that the sudden shift to online education was done smoothly, more than half (57.6%) agreed or strongly agreed that virtual lectures were more flexible than face-to-face lectures, and a majority (79.7%) agreed or strongly agreed that the technology used for online education was reliable. A minority of participants agreed or strongly agreed that research (20.4%), community service (11.4%), and participation in scientific meetings (15.2%) had not been affected by the suspension. CONCLUSION: Suspending classes without stopping education has been implemented effectively, and administrative work has continued to run smoothly.

Statistical and geospatial analyses highlight greater impacts in the Great Plains, Southwestern and Southern regions based on cases and fatalities per 100,000 population. Significant case and fatality spatial clusters were most prevalent between November 2020 and January 2021. Distinct urban–rural differences in COVID-19 experiences uncovered higher rural cases and fatalities per 100,000 population and fewer government mitigation actions enacted in rural counties. High levels of social vulnerability and the absence of mitigation policies were significantly associated with higher fatalities, while existing community resilience had more influential spatial explanatory power. Using differences in percentage unemployment changes between 2019 and 2020 as a proxy for pre-emergent recovery revealed urban counties were hit harder in the early months of the pandemic, corresponding with imposed government mitigation policies. This longitudinal, place-based study confirms some early urban–rural patterns initially observed in the pandemic, as well as the disparate COVID-19 experiences among socially vulnerable populations. The results are critical in identifying geographic disparities in COVID-19 exposures and outcomes and providing the evidentiary basis for targeting pandemic recovery.","Jackson, Sarah L.; Derakhshan, Sahar; Blackwood, Leah; Lee, Logan; Huang, Qian; Habets, Margot; Cutter, Susan L.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444007/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168259,60
657258,Human Coronavirus 229E Remains Infectious on Common Touch Surface Materials,2015-11-10,"Sport and fitness have long been linked with healthy lifestyles, yet most sporting events and consumption practices are highly detrimental to the environment. While academics have examined the harmful effects of sporting mega-events and the production and consumption of sport equipment and clothing, there has been less engagement with the “mundane,” everyday activities of consuming, laundering, and recycling of fitness objects. In this paper, we explore the potential in feminist new materialisms for rethinking the complex relationships between sport, fitness, and the environment. In particular, we explain how our engagement with Karen Barad's theory of agential realism led us to rethink women's habitual fitness practices as connected to environmental degradation. Working with Barad's concept of entanglement, we came to notice new human-clothing-environment relationships, focusing on how athleisure clothing itself is an active, vital force that intra-acts with other non-human (and human) matter within the environment. Adopting a diffractive methodology that included reading interviews with women about their activewear practices, our own experiences, new materialist theory, and environmental literature through each other, we focus on two examples that emerged through this process: laundering and disposal practices. Through these examples, we demonstrate the ways in which new materialisms encouraged us to move toward non-anthropocentric understandings of the sport-environment relationship and toward new ethical practices in our everyday fitness lifestyles.","Brice, Julie E.; Thorpe, Holly",Front Sports Act Living,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34142083/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2021.660935,60

ORF8 is a rapidly evolving accessory protein that has been proposed to interfere with immune responses. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 was determined at 2.04 Å resolution by x-ray crystallography. The structure reveals a ~60 residue core similar to SARS-CoV ORF7a with the addition of two dimerization interfaces unique to SARS-CoV-2 ORF8. A covalent disulfide-linked dimer is formed through an N-terminal sequence specific to SARS-CoV-2, while a separate non-covalent interface is formed by another SARS-CoV-2-specific sequence, (73)YIDI(76). Together the presence of these interfaces shows how SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 can form unique large-scale assemblies not possible for SARS-CoV, potentially mediating unique immune suppression and evasion activities.","Flower, Thomas G.; Buffalo, Cosmo Z.; Hooy, Richard M.; Allaire, Marc; Ren, Xuefeng; Hurley, James H.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32869027/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.27.270637,60

METHODS: We collected data published day by daily from the first COVID-19 case until May 3, 2020, the end of lockdown, by Italy’s Protezione Civile Department. Linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate possible correlations between the number of confirmed cases/100.000 residents and the number of new cases/100.000/day before lockdown, with the number of deaths/100.000 residents at sixty days, in each Italian region. RESULTS: We found a significant positive correlation between the number of confirmed cases before lockdown and mortality up to sixty days (p < 0.001; R(2) = 0.57) as well as between the incidence rate of new cases per day and mortality up to sixty days (p < 0.001; R(2) = 0.73).

A common barrier to providing this evidence-based practice is diagnostic uncertainty. We sought to test the hypothesis that patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus disease 2019, in whom acute respiratory distress syndrome is easily recognized, would be more likely to receive low tidal volume ventilation than concurrently admitted acute respiratory distress syndrome patients without coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Five hospitals of a single health system. PATIENTS: Mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 or noncoronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome as identified by an automated, electronic acute respiratory distress syndrome finder in clinical use at study hospitals. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 333 coronavirus disease 2019 patients and 234 noncoronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, the average initial tidal volume was 6.4 cc/kg predicted body weight and 6.8 cc/kg predicted body weight, respectively. Patients had tidal volumes less than or equal to 6.5 cc/kg predicted body weight for a mean of 70% of the first 72 hours of mechanical ventilation in the coronavirus disease 2019 cohort, compared with 52% in the noncoronavirus disease 2019 cohort (unadjusted p < 0.001). After adjusting for height, gender, admitting hospital, and whether or not the patient was admitted to a medical specialty ICU, coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis was associated with a 21% higher percentage of time receiving tidal volumes less than or equal to 6.5 cc/kg predicted body weight within the first 72 hours of mechanical ventilation (95% CI, 14–28%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to low tidal volume ventilation during the first 72 hours of mechanical ventilation is higher in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 than with acute respiratory distress syndrome without coronavirus disease 2019.

METHODS: Following protein precipitation, samples were separated with a two-dimensional ultra high performance liquid chromatography (2D-UHPLC) setup, consisting of an online solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled to an analytical column. For quantification, stable isotope-labelled analogues were used as internal standards for all analytes. The method was validated on the basis of the European Medicines Agency bioanalytical method validation protocol. RESULTS: Detuning of lopinavir and ritonavir allowed simultaneous quantification of all analytes with different concentration ranges and sensitivity with a uniform injection volume of 5 µL. The method provided robust validation results with inaccuracy and imprecision values of ≤ 9.59 % and ≤ 11.1 % for all quality controls. CONCLUSION: The presented method is suitable for accurate and simultaneous quantification of remdesivir, its metabolite GS-441525, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, favipiravir and azithromycin in human serum. The quantitative assay may be an efficient tool for the therapeutic drug monitoring of these potential drug candidates in COVID-19 patients in order to increase treatment efficacy and safety.","Habler, Katharina; Brügel, Mathias; Teupser, Daniel; Liebchen, Uwe; Scharf, Christina; Schönermarck, Ulf; Vogeser, Michael; Paal, Michael",J Pharm Biomed Anal,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0731708521000479?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2021.113935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33548872/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0731708521000479,60

Vaginal lactobacilli and lactoferrin represent two essential actors in the vaginal environment. Lactobacilli represent the dominant bacterial species able to prevent facultative and obligate anaerobes outnumber in vaginal microbiota maintaining healthy microbial homeostasis. Several mechanisms underlie the protection exerted by lactobacilli: competition for nutrients and tissue adherence, reduction of the vaginal pH, modulation of immunity, and production of bioactive compounds. Among bioactive factors of cervicovaginal mucosa, lactoferrin, an iron-binding cationic glycoprotein, is a multifunctional glycoprotein with antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiparasitic activities, recently emerging as an important modulator of inflammation. Lactobacilli and lactoferrin are largely under the influence of female hormones and of paracrine production of various cytokines. Lactoferrin is strongly increased in lower genital tract mucosal fluid of women affected by Neisseria gonorrheae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis infections promoting both innate and adaptive immune responses. In vaginal dysbiosis characterized by low amounts of vaginal lactobacilli and increased levels of endogenous anaerobic bacteria, the increase in lactoferrin could act as an immune modulator assuming the role normally played by the healthy microbiota in vaginal mucosa. Then lactoferrin and lactobacilli may be considered as biomarkers of altered microbial homeostasis at vaginal level. Considering the shortage of effective treatments to counteract recurrent and/or antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, the intravaginal administration of lactobacilli and lactoferrin could be a novel efficient therapeutic strategy and a valuable tool to restore mucosal immune homeostasis.","Valenti, Piera; Rosa, Luigi; Capobianco, Daniela; Lepanto, Maria Stefania; Schiavi, Elisa; Cutone, Antimo; Paesano, Rosalba; Mastromarino, Paola",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29545798/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.00376,60
661028,Manipulation of the unfolded protein response: A pharmacological strategy against coronavirus infection,2021-06-17,"INTRODUCTION: Early detection of cognitive impairments is crucial for the successful implementation of preventive strategies. However, in rural isolated areas or so-called ‘medical deserts’, access to diagnosis and care is very limited. With the current pandemic crisis, now even more than ever, remote solutions such as telemedicine platforms represent great potential and can help to overcome this barrier. Moreover, current advances made in voice and image analysis can help overcome the barrier of physical distance by providing additional information on a patients’ emotional and cognitive state. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of a videoconference system for remote cognitive testing empowered by automatic speech and video analysis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 60 participants (aged 55 and older) with and without cognitive impairment will be recruited. A complete neuropsychological assessment including a short clinical interview will be administered in two conditions, once by telemedicine and once by face-to-face. The order of administration procedure will be counterbalanced so half of the sample starts with the videoconference condition and the other half with the face-to-face condition. Acceptability and user experience will be assessed among participants and clinicians in a qualitative and quantitative manner. Speech and video features will be extracted and analysed to obtain additional information on mood and engagement levels. In a subgroup, measurements of stress indicators such as heart rate and skin conductance will be compared. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The procedures are not invasive and there are no expected risks or burdens to participants. All participants will be informed that this is an observational study and their consent taken prior to the experiment. Demonstration of the effectiveness of such technology makes it possible to diffuse its use across all rural areas (‘medical deserts’) and thus, to improve the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative pathologies, while providing data crucial for basic research. Results from this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals.","König, Alexandra; Zeghari, Radia; Guerchouche, Rachid; Duc Tran, Minh; Bremond, François; Linz, Nicklas; Lindsay, Hali; Langel, Kai; Ramakers, Inez; Lemoine, Pascale; Bultingaire, Vincent; Robert, Philippe",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34475154/,60

The role of m(6)Am and the function of PCIF1 in regulating host–pathogens interactions are unknown. Here, we investigate the dynamics and reprogramming of the host m(6)Am RNA methylome during HIV infection. We show that HIV infection induces a dramatic decrease in m(6)Am of cellular mRNAs. By using PCIF1 depleted T cells, we identify 2237 m(6)Am genes and 854 are affected by HIV infection. Strikingly, we find that PCIF1 methyltransferase function restricts HIV replication. Further mechanism studies show that HIV viral protein R (Vpr) interacts with PCIF1 and induces PCIF1 ubiquitination and degradation. Among the m(6)Am genes, we find that PCIF1 inhibits HIV infection by enhancing a transcription factor ETS1 (ETS Proto-Oncogene 1, transcription factor) stability that binds HIV promoter to regulate viral transcription. Altogether, our study discovers the role of PCIF1 in HIV–host interactions, identifies m(6)Am modified genes in T cells which are affected by viral infection, and reveals how HIV regulates host RNA epitranscriptomics through PCIF1 degradation.","Zhang, Qiong; Kang, Yuqi; Wang, Shaobo; Gonzalez, Gwendolyn Michelle; Li, Wanyu; Hui, Hui; Wang, Yinsheng; Rana, Tariq M.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34545078/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25683-4,60

We argue that an evolutionary perspective is especially important for women’s health care providers, as selection will act strongly on reproductive parameters, and the biological costs of female reproduction are generally more resource expensive than for men (e.g. due to gestation and lactation) with greater effects on health and wellbeing. An evolutionary perspective is needed to understand antibiotic resistance, disease and health risks associated with mismatches between our evolved adaptations and current conditions, the importance of the microbiome and the maternal role in how infants acquire and develop their early-life microbiome (vaginal birth, lactation), and the importance of breastmilk as a biochemical signal from mothers to their babies.

661550,Virus against virus: a potential treatment for 2019-nCov (SARS-CoV-2) and other RNA viruses,2020-02-18,"BACKGROUND: Population health management (PHM) by hospital groups is not yet defined nor implemented in France. However, in 2019, the French Hospitals Federation launched a pilot program to experiment PHM in five territories around five Territorial Hospital Groups (GHT’s). In order to implement PHM, it is necessary to firstly define the population which healthcare facilities (hospitals) have responsibility for. In the French healthcare system, mapping of health territories however relies mainly on administrative data criteria which do not fit with the actual implementation of GHT’s. Mapping for the creation of territorial hospital groups (GHTs) also did not include medical criteria nor all healthcare offers particularly in private hospitals and primary care services, who are not legally part of GHT’s but are major healthcare providers. The objective of this study was to define the French population groups for PHM per hospital group. METHODS: A database study based on DRG (acute care, post-acute and rehabilitation, psychiatry and home care) from the French National Hospitals Database was conducted. Data included all hospital stays from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017. The main outcome of this study was to create mutually exclusive territories that would reflect an accurate national healthcare service consumption. A six-step method was implemented using automated analysis reviewed manually by national experts. RESULTS: In total, 2840 healthcare facilities, 5571 geographical zones and 31,441,506 hospital stays were identified and collated from the database. In total, 132 GHTs were included and there were 72 zones (1.3%) allocated to a different GHTs. Furthermore, 200 zones were manually reviewed with 33 zones allocated to another GHT. Only one area did not have a population superior to 50,000 inhabitants. Three were shown to have a population superior to 2 million. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated a feasible methodology to define the French population under the responsibility of 132 hospital groups validated by a national group of experts.","Malone, A.; Gomez, S.; Finkel, S.; Chourchoulis, D.; Morcos, E.; Loko, M.

The proposed algorithm relies on the depth channel of the camera to estimate the movements of the body’s trunk during breathing. It solves in fixed-time complexity, [Formula: see text] , as the acquisition relies on the mean depth value of the target regions only using the color channels to automatically locate them. This simplicity allows the extraction of real-time values of the respiration, as well as the synchronous assessment on multiple body parts. Two different experiments have been performed: a first one conducted on 10 users in a single region and with a fixed breathing frequency, and a second one conducted on 20 users considering a simultaneous acquisition in two regions. The breath rate has then been computed and compared with a reference measurement. The results show a non-statistically significant bias of [Formula: see text] breaths/min and [Formula: see text] limits of agreement of [Formula: see text] / [Formula: see text] breaths/min regarding the breath-by-breath assessment.

Although it was predicted that Africa would suffer a massive loss of life, the number of COVID-19 cases has been relatively low across the continent. Researchers have speculated that a number of factors could be responsible for this pattern in Africa, including the extensive experience that countries have with infectious diseases and the young median age of their populations. However, it is still important for African countries to adopt aggressive and bold approaches against COVID-19, in case the nature of the pandemic changes.

Robust antibody responses were detected in all survivors who had severe disease; responses remained detectable, albeit with some waning, for <1 year. The duration of viral RNA detection (but not viral load) in sputum significantly correlated with the antibody response magnitude. The MERS S1 ELISA antibody titers correlated well with the neutralizing antibody response. Antibody titers in 4 of 6 patients who had mild illness were undetectable even though most had evidence of pneumonia.

To test new molecules for shortening, alleviating the diseases or to develop new therapies, relevant human in vitro models are mandatory. MucilAir™, a human standardized air-liquid interface 3D airway epithelial culture holds in vitro specific mechanisms to counter invaders comparable to the in vivo situation, such as mucus production, mucociliary clearance, and secretion of defensive molecules. The objective of this study was to test the relevance of such a model for the discovery and validation of antiviral drugs. Fully differentiated 3D nasal epithelium cultures were inoculated with picornaviruses, a coronavirus and influenza A viruses in the absence or in the presence of reference antiviral drugs. Results showed that, rupintrivir efficiently inhibits the replication of respiratory picornaviruses in a dose dependent manner and prevents the impairment of the mucociliary clearance. Similarly, oseltamivir reduced the replication of influenza A viruses in a dose dependent manner and prevented the impairment of the epithelial barrier function and cytotoxicity until 4 days of infection. In addition we found that Rhinovirus B14, C15 and influenza A(H1N1) induce significant increase of β Defensins 2 and Cathelicidin release with different time course. These results reveal that a large panel of epithelial functions is modified upon viral infection and validate MucilAir™ as a pertinent tool for pre-clinical antiviral drug testing.","Boda, Bernadett; Benaoudia, Sacha; Huang, Song; Bonfante, Rosy; Wiszniewski, Ludovic; Tseligka, Eirini D.; Tapparel, Caroline; Constant, Samuel",Antiviral Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354217307350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29890184/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.06.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354217307350,60

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently finally determined in laboratory settings by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (rt-PCR). However, simple testing with immediately available results are crucial to gain control over COVID-19. The aim was to evaluate such a point-of-care antigen rapid test (AG-rt) device in its performance compared to laboratory-based rt-PCR testing in COVID-19 suspected, symptomatic patients. Methods. For this prospective study, two specimen each of 541 symptomatic female (54.7%) and male (45.3%) patients aged between 18 and 95 years tested at five emergency departments (ED, n=296) and four primary healthcare centres (PHC, n=245), were compared, using AG-rt (positive/negative/invalid) and rt-PCR (positive/negative and cycle threshold, Ct) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratios (LR+/-) of the AG-rt were assessed. Results. Differences between ED and PHC were detected regarding gender, age, symptoms, disease prevalence, and diagnostic performance. Overall, 174 (32.2%) were tested positive on AG-rt and 213 (39.4%) on rt-PCR. AG correctly classified 91.7% of all rt-PCR positive cases with a sensitivity of 80.3%, specificity of 99.1%, PPV of 98.3, NPV of 88.6%, LR(+) of 87.8, and LR(-) of 0.20. The highest sensitivities and specificities of AG-rt were detected in PHC (sensitivity: 84.4%, specificity: 100.0%), when using Ct of 30 as cut-off (sensitivity: 92.5%, specificity: 97.8%), and when the symptom onset was within the first three days (sensitivity: 82.9%, specificity: 99.6%). Conclusions. The highest sensitivity was detected with a high viral load.

Herein a rapid (<1 h), easy-to-implement, and accurate CRISPR-based evanescent wave fluorescence biosensing platform for detection of SARS-CoV-2 is reported. The collateral effect of Cas13a is combined with a universal autonomous enzyme-free hybridization chain reaction (HCR) by designing a cleavage hairpin reporter, which is cleaved upon target recognition, and hence releasing the initiator sequence to trigger the downstream HCR circuits. Detection of HCR assemblies is accomplished by first adsorbing to the desthiobiotin-modified optical fiber, followed by fluorescence emission induced by an evanescent field. Three Cas13a crRNAs targeting the genes of S, N and Orf1ab of SARS-CoV-2 are programmed to specifically target SARS-CoV-2 or broadly detect related coronavirus strains, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The HCR amplification coupled Cas13a-based biosensing platform is capable of rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 with attomolar sensitivity. This method is further validated by adding target RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in negative oropharyngeal swabs.

HBoV should be considered for inclusion in screening protocols for nosocomial childhood respiratory infections, especially in intensive care units.","Durigon, G.S.; Oliveira, D.B.L.; Vollet, S.B.; Storni, J.G.; Felício, M.C.C.; Finelli, C.; Piera, J.; Magalhães, M.; Caldeira, R.N.; Barbosa, M.L.; Durigon, E.L.; Berezin, E.N.",J Hosp Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670110002458; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2010.04.028; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670110002458; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20619493/,60
666109,Coronavirus Cell Entry Occurs through the Endo-/Lysosomal Pathway in a Proteolysis-Dependent Manner,2014-11-06,"OBJECTIVE: Prior to coronavirus disease (COVID-19), many Australians experienced extreme bushfires, droughts, and floods. A history of experiencing these events might be a risk factor for increased psychological distress during COVID-19. This study aimed to provide insight into the mental health of Australian workers during the initial COVID-19 outbreak, with an additional focus on whether previous disaster exposure and impact from that disaster is a risk factor for increased psychological distress. METHODS: A snowball recruitment strategy was used. Participants (n = 596) completed an online survey, which included the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21, and questions related to mental health and disaster exposure. RESULTS: Overall, 19.2%, 13.4%, and 16.8% of participants were experiencing moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. Multiple regression found that higher depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were associated with a pre-existing mental health diagnosis; only higher stress symptoms were associated with having experienced a disaster, with impact, in addition to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: People who have experienced impact from an additional disaster might need additional support to protect their mental health during COVID-19. A focus on the cumulative mental health impacts of multiple disasters and the implications for organizational communities where recovery work is undertaken, such as schools and workplaces, is needed.","Podubinski, Tegan; Glenister, Kristen M.",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34296670/,60

How do IFNLs impact COPD and its exacerbations? METHODS: Five hundred twenty eight patients were recruited in a prospective observational multicentre cohort (PROMISE) study. The genetic polymorphisms (rs8099917 and rs12979860) within the IFNL3/4 gene region and circulating levels of IFNL3 in COPD patients were determined and associated with disease activity and outcome during a median follow-up of 24 months. RESULTS: The GG genotype significantly influenced severe exacerbation rate (42 vs. 23%; p = 0.032) and time to severe exacerbation (HR = 2.260; p = 0.012). Compared to the TT or TG genotypes, the GG genotype was associated with severe dyspnoea (modified medical research council score ≥ median 3; 22 vs 42%, p = 0.030). The CC genotype of the rs12979860 SNP was associated with a poorer prognosis (body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea and exercise capacity index ≥ median 4; 46 vs. 36% TC vs. 20.5% TT; p = 0.031). Patients with stable COPD and at exacerbation had significantly lower circulating IFNL3 compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Circulating IFNL3 correlated to post-bronchodilator FEV(1)%predicted and the tissue maturation biomarker Pro-collagen 3. CONCLUSION: IFNL3/4 polymorphisms and circulating IFNL3 may be associated with disease activity and outcomes in COPD.

However, due to coronavirus disease 2019, many mass treatment campaigns for schistosomiasis have been halted, with uncertain implications for the programmes. METHODS: We use mathematical modelling to explore how postponement of MDA and various mitigation strategies affect achievement of the EPHP goal for Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium. RESULTS: For both S. mansoni and S. haematobium in moderate- and some high-prevalence settings, the disruption may delay the goal by up to 2 y. In some high-prevalence settings, EPHP is not achievable with current strategies and so the disruption will not impact this. Here, increasing SAC coverage and treating adults can achieve the goal. The impact of MDA disruption and the appropriate mitigation strategy varies according to the baseline prevalence prior to treatment, the burden of infection in adults and the stage of the programme. CONCLUSIONS: Schistosomiasis MDA programmes in medium- and high-prevalence areas should restart as soon as is feasible and mitigation strategies may be required in some settings.","Kura, Klodeta; Ayabina, Diepreye; Toor, Jaspreet; Hollingsworth, T Deirdre; Anderson, Roy M",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33515038/; https://doi.org/10.1093/trstmh/traa202,60

For COVID-19, we established a rapid production procedure for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein) by using the baculovirus-silkworm expression system. The baculovirus vector-derived S proteins were successfully secreted to silkworm serum, whereas those formed insoluble structure in the larval fat body and the pupal cells. The ectodomain of S protein with the native sequence was cleaved by the host furin-protease, resulting in less recombinant protein production. The S protein modified in furin protease-target site was efficiently secreted to silkworm serum and was purified as oligomers, which showed immunoreactivity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 S2 antibody. By using the direct transfection of recombinant bacmid to silkworms, we achieved the efficient production of SARS-CoV-2 S protein as fetal bovine serum (FBS)-free system. The resultant purified S protein would be useful tools for the development of immunodetection kits, antigen for immunization for immunoglobulin production, and vaccines.","Fujita, Ryosuke; Hino, Masato; Ebihara, Takeru; Nagasato, Takumi; Masuda, Akitsu; Lee, Jae Man; Fujii, Tsuguru; Mon, Hiroaki; Kakino, Kohei; Nagai, Ryo; Tanaka, Miyu; Tonooka, Yoshino; Moriyama, Takato; Kusakabe, Takahiro",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.06.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X20312146?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32703420/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X20312146,60
668601,Tackling influenza with broadly neutralizing antibodies,2017-05-18,"As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments encouraged or mandated homeworking wherever possible. This study examines the impact of this public health initiative on homeworkers’ well-being. It explores if the general factors such as job autonomy, demands, social support and work–nonwork conflict, which under normal circumstances are crucial for employees’ well-being, are outweighed by factors specific to homeworking and the pandemic as predictors of well-being. Using data from four-week diary studies conducted at two time periods in 2020 involving university employees in the UK, we assessed five factors that may be associated with their well-being: job characteristics, the work–home interface, home location, the enforced nature of the homeworking, and the pandemic context. Multi-level analysis confirms the relationship between four of the five factors and variability in within-person well-being, the exception being variables connected to the enforced homeworking. The results are very similar in both waves. A smaller set of variables explained between-person variability: psychological detachment, loneliness and job insecurity in both periods. Well-being was lower in the second than the first wave, as loneliness increased and the ability to detach from work declined. The findings highlight downsides of homeworking, will be relevant for employees’ and employers’ decisions about working arrangements post-pandemic, and contribute to the debate about the limits of employee well-being models centred on job characteristics.","Wood, Stephen James; Michaelides, George; Inceoglu, Ilke; Hurren, Elizabeth T.; Daniels, Kevin; Niven, Karen",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34300025/,60

Nutrition metrics calculated from quantitative food system projections can help focus policy actions. OBJECTIVES: To estimate future chronic and hidden hunger disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)—due to protein-energy undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies, respectively—using food systems projections to evaluate the potential impact of climate change and agricultural sector investment for adaptation. METHODS: We use a novel combination of a chronic and hidden hunger DALY estimation procedure and food system projections from quantitative foresight modeling to assess DALYs under alternative agricultural sector scenarios to midcentury. RESULTS: Total chronic and hidden hunger DALYs are projected to increase globally out to 2050—by over 30 million compared with 2010—even without climate change. Climate change increases total DALY change between 2010 and 2050 by nearly 10% compared with no climate change. Agricultural sector investments show promise for offsetting these impacts. With investments, DALY incidence due to chronic and hidden hunger is projected to decrease globally in 2050 by 0.24 and 0.56 per 1000 capita, respectively. Total global DALYs will still rise because projected population growth will outpace the rate reduction, especially in Africa south of the Sahara. However, projections also show important regional reductions in total DALYs due to chronic (13.9 million in South Asia, 4.3 million in East Asia and the Pacific) and hidden hunger (7.5 million in East Asia and the Pacific) with investments. CONCLUSIONS: Food system projections to 2050 show a decreasing DALY incidence from both chronic and hidden hunger. Population growth is projected to outpace these improvements and lead to increasing total chronic and hidden hunger DALYs globally, concentrated in Africa south of the Sahara. Climate change increases per-capita chronic and hidden hunger DALY incidence compared with no climate change.

Factors associated with AKI in COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients and their outcomes have not been previously explored. METHODS: Prospective observational study of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICUs of the Hospital Clínic of Barcelona (Spain), from March 25th to April 21st, 2020, who developed AKI stage 2 or higher (AKIN classification). The primary goal was to describe the characteristics of moderate-severe AKI of COVID-19 patients in an ICU context. As a secondary goal, we aimed to find independent predictors of AKI progression, Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) requirement and mortality among these patients. RESULTS: During the study period, 52 out of 237 ICU patients, developed AKIN stage 2 or higher and were included in the study. A Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at AKI diagnosis of 8 or higher was associated with RRT, OR 5.2, p 0.032. At the time of AKI diagnosis, patients had a worse liver profile and higher inflammation markers than at admission. Fifty per cent of the patients presented AKI progression from AKIN 2 to 3 and 28.85% required RRT. The use of corticosteroids in 69.2% of patients was associated with a reduced requirement of RRT, OR 0.13 (CI 95% 0.02–0.89), p 0.037. AKI was associated with high mortality (50%) and a longer hospital stay, median 35 vs 18 days (p 0.024).

High viral RNA titres were detected in the internal organs by a real-time RT-PCR assay specific for CCoV type II. Sequence analysis of the 3′ end (8.7 kb) of the genomic RNA of strain CB/05 revealed conserved structural as well as non-structural proteins, with the exception of a truncated form of non-structural protein 3b. The exceptional form was due to a 38-nucleotide deletion and a frame shift in ORF3b that introduced an early stop codon.

The objective of this study was to determine the health facility (HF) preparedness for RMNH service delivery during the outbreak from the perspective of RMNH providers and to determine what factors significantly predict this. An anonymous cross-sectional online survey of RMNH providers was conducted from 1st to 21st July 2020 in Lagos state Nigeria. We conducted a descriptive and ordinal regression analysis, with RMNH worker perception of HF preparedness for RMNH service delivery during the outbreak as the dependent variable. Two hundred and fifty-six RMNH workers participated, 35.2% reported that RMNH services were unavailable at some time since March 2020, 39% felt moderate or extreme work-related burnout, 84% were moderately or extremely concerned about the availability of PPE and related guidelines, and only 11.7% were extremely satisfied with the preparedness of their HFs. Our final model was a statistically significant predictor of RMNH worker perception of HF preparedness explaining 54.7% of the variation in the outcome variable. A one-unit increase in the level of satisfaction with the communication from HF management and level of concern about the availability of PPE and COVID-19 guidelines would increase the odds of observing a higher category of satisfaction with HF COVID-19 preparedness (OR 0.79-2.92, p<0.001 and 0.02-0.15 p<0.001 respectively).

Asymptomatic carriers of the virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19. The asymptomatic sub-population frequently escapes detection by public health surveillance systems. Because of this, the currently accepted estimates of the basic reproduction number (Ro) of the virus are inaccurate. It is unlikely that a pathogen can blanket the planet in three months with an Ro in the vicinity of 3, as reported in the literature. In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model taking into account asymptomatic carriers. Our results indicate that an initial value of the effective reproduction number could range from 5.5 to 25.4, with a point estimate of 15.4, assuming mean parameters. The first three weeks of the model exhibit exponential growth, which is in agreement with average case data collected from thirteen countries with universal health care and robust communicable disease surveillance systems; the average rate of growth in the number of reported cases is 23.3% per day during this period.","Aguilar, Jacob B; Faust, Jeremy Samuel; Westafer, Lauren M.; Gutierrez, Juan B.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.18.20037994,60

The symptoms of rhinosinusitis are nasal drainage, congestion, and sinus pressure. A bacterial sinus infection is more likely if these symptoms worsen after 5–7 days or do not improve after 10–14 days. The majority of bacterial episodes have been associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. In the current era of increasing resistance to β-lactams and macrolides, treatment guidelines have been formulated worldwide to assist clinicians in the selection of antibacterials. According to one model, the following antibacterials are most likely to provide desired outcomes (90%–92% predicted clinical efficacy) for adults: respiratory fluoroquinolones (i.e., moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and levofloxacin), ceftriaxone, and high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (4 g of amoxicillin/day and 250 mg of clavulanate/day). Although the role of the fluoroquinolones in the treatment of this condition is evolving, fluoroquinolones are often recommended as second-line therapy or as first-line therapy for selected patients (e.g., those who received antibacterials in the previous 4–6 weeks or adults with moderate-to-severe disease).","Anon, Jack B.",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15942883/,60

With simple mathematical models of YF transmission, we calculate the infection attack rate (IAR, the proportion of population infected over the course of an epidemic) under varying levels of transmissibility and five-fold fractional-dose vaccine efficacy for two vaccination scenarios: (i) random vaccination in a hypothetical population that is completely susceptible; (ii) the Kinshasa vaccination campaign in July–August 2016 with different age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines. FINDINGS: We estimate the effective reproductive number early in the Angola outbreak was between 5·2 and 7·1. If vaccine action is all-or-nothing (i.e. a proportion VE of vaccinees receives complete and the remainder receive no protection), n-fold fractionation can dramatically reduce IAR as long as efficacy VE exceeds 1/n. This benefit threshold becomes more stringent if vaccine action is leaky (i.e. the susceptibility of each vaccinee is reduced by a factor that is equal to the vaccine efficacy VE). The age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines chosen by the WHO for the Kinshasa vaccination campaign (namely, 2 years) provides the largest reduction in IAR if the efficacy of five-fold fractional-dose vaccines exceeds 20%. INTERPRETATION: Dose fractionation is a very effective strategy for reducing infection attack rate that would be robust with a large margin for error in case fractional-dose VE is lower than expected.","Wu, Joseph T.; Peak, Corey M.; Leung, Gabriel M.; Lipsitch, Marc",Lancet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27837923/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(16)31838-4,60

Very few cases of EV68 infection were described over the ensuing 40 years. However, in the past few years, an increase in severe respiratory tract infections associated with EV68 has been reported. We identified two clusters of EV68 infection in South London, UK, one each in the autumn/winters of 2009 and 2010. Sequence comparison showed significant homology of the UK strains with those from other countries including the Netherlands, Japan and the Philippines, which reported EV68 outbreaks between 2008 and 2010. Phylogenetic analysis of all available VP1 sequences indicated the presence of two modern EV68 lineages. The 2010 UK strains belonged to lineage 2. Lineage 1 could be further divided into two sub-lineages: some Japanese and Dutch strains collected between 2004 and 2010 form a distinct sub-lineages (sub-lineage 1.1), whereas other strains from the UK, Japan, Netherlands and Philippines collected between 2008 and 2010 represent sub-lineage 1.2. The UK 2009 strains together with several Dutch and Japanese strains from 2009/2010 represents one variant (1.2.1), whereas those from the Philippines a second variant (1.2.2). Based on specific deletions and substitutions, we suggest rules for the assignment of lineages and sub-lineages. Molecular epidemiological analysis indicates rapid recent evolution of EV68 and this may explain the recent findings of a global resurgence of EV68. Continuous global monitoring of the clinical and molecular epidemiology of EV68 is recommended.","Lauinger, Ina L.; Bible, Jon M.; Halligan, Eugene P.; Aarons, Emma J.; MacMahon, Eithne; Tong, Cheuk Y.

Report on communication and qualified listening in nursing work in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS. This descriptive, theoretical and reflexive report was developed by nurses between March 20th and May 25th 2020 at Emergency Care Services in the city of Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil. Health communication served as the theoretical background for this research. RESULTS. Two main thematic categories were highlighted: (i) Resignifications of communication in the work relationships of the health team and (ii) Guided listening to users by nurses at the Emergency Care Services during the pandemic. CONCLUSION. The experience revealed an excerpt of what is found under the conditions of the current situation resulting from COVID-19. Communication turned into an essential tool to maintain professional relationships and culminate in collaboration and cooperation of the team in order to provide a close relationship with the user and promote the quality of health care processes.","Nogueira Galeno Rodrigues, Maria Eunice; da Costa Belarmino, Adriano; Lopes Custódio, Lívia; Lima Verde Gomes, Ilvana; Rodrigues, Antonio",Invest Educ Enferm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33306899/; https://doi.org/10.17533/udea.iee.v38n3e09,60
672482,Computational Identification of a Putative Allosteric Binding Pocket in TMPRSS2,2021-04-30,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is considered the most frequent tumor that associated with high mortality rate. Several risk factors contribute to the pathogenesis of HCC, such as chronic persistent infection with hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus, chronic untreated inflammation of liver with different etiology, oxidative stress and fatty liver disease. Several treatment protocols are used in the treatment of HCC but they also associated with diverse side effects. Many natural products are helpful in the co-treatment and prevention of HCC. Several mechanisms are involved in the action of these herbal products and their bioactive compounds in the prevention and co-treatment of HCC. They can inhibit the liver cancer development and progression in several ways as protecting against liver carcinogens, enhancing effects of chemotherapeutic drugs, inhibiting tumor cell growth and metastasis, and suppression of oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. In this review, we will discuss the utility of diverse natural products in the prevention and co-treatment of HCC, through its capturing of the common risk factors known to lead to HCC and shed the light on their possible mechanisms of action. Our theory assumes that shutting down the risk factor to cancer development pathways is a critical strategy in cancer prevention and management. We recommend the use of these plants side by side to recent chemical medications and after stopping these chemicals, as a maintenance therapy to avoid HCC progression and decrease its global incidence.","Abdel-Hamid, Nabil M.; Abass, Shimaa A.; Mohamed, Ahmed A.; Muneam Hamid, Daniah",Biomed Pharmacother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30257339/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2018.08.104; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S075333221834280X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S075333221834280X,60

Méthodes: Il s’agit d’un audit de la conformité des communiqués de presse et des bulletins épidémiologiques, analysés via un référentiel de qualité, spécialement conçu par les auteurs. Ce référentiel, composé de cinq dimensions et de 50 items, cotés (0/1), a été appliqué par deux chercheurs en médecine préventive. La multiplication des notes par un coefficient de deux, a permis d’avoir un score partiel de 20 points pour chaque dimension et un score total de 100 points pour l’ensemble de la check list. La qualité des supports de communication a été jugée bonne au-delà des seuils de 15/20 pour les dimensions du référentiel et de 75/100 pour la totalité de la grille. Résultats: Un total de 141 supports de communication a été inclus dans cet audit (Tunisie: 60, Algérie: 60, Maroc: 21). Le score global médian de la qualité de ces supports a été seulement de 56/100 (IIQ: [46-58]), sans variabilité notable entre les pays. La dimension la plus appréciée a été le «maintien de la confiance de la population» avec un score médian global de 14/20 (12/20 pour les bulletins épidémiologiques et 16/20 pour les communiqués de presse). La dimension la moins bien notée a été le «renforcement de la participation communautaire», avec un score médian de seulement 4/20 (6/20 pour les bulletins épidémiologiques et 4/20 pour les communiqués de presse). Conclusion: La qualité des supports maghrébins de communication de crise, au cours de la COVID-19, a été insuffisante dans la majorité de ses dimensions et de ses items (dont surtout psychosociaux). Le renforcement des capacités des chargés de communication, dans l’élaboration des supports d’information, au cours des crises sanitaires, est indispensable et urgent. Objective: To objectively assess the quality of “crisis communication” media, during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the three Greater Maghreb countries (Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco). Methods: A compliance audit for press releases and epidemiological bulletins was analyzed against a quality benchmark, which had been specifically designed by the authors. This framework, made up of five dimensions and 50 items, graded (0/1), was applied by two researchers in preventive medicine. Multiplying the scores by a coefficient of two resulted in a partial score of 20 points for each dimension and a total score of 100 points for the checklist taken as a whole. The quality of the communication media was considered to be good when exceeding the thresholds of 15/20 for the different dimensions and 75/100 for the entire grid. Results: A total of 141 information media were included in this audit (Tunisia: 60; Algeria: 60; Morocco: 21). The overall median quality score for these media was only 56/100 (IIQ: [46-58]), without major variability between countries. The most appreciated dimension was “maintaining the confidence of the population”, with an overall median score of 14/20 (12/20 for epidemiological bulletins and 16/20 for press releases). The most poorly rated dimension was “strengthening community participation”, with a median score of only 4/20 (6/20 for epidemiological bulletins and 4/20 for press releases). Conclusion: The quality of the Maghreb crisis communication media during COVID-19 was insufficient in most of its dimensions and items, particularly from a psychosocial standpoint. Reinforcement of the capacities of communication officers to develop information material and supports during health crises is indispensable and should be considered as an urgent matter.","Ben Abdelaziz, A.; El Haddad, N.; Hannachi, H.; Nouira, S.; Melki, S.; Chebil, D.; Chelly, S.; Quessar, A.; Boussouf, N.",Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33966926/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0398762021000729; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0398762021000729?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respe.2021.03.001,60

There is a need to understand service response to share good practice and prepare for future care. AIM: To map and understand specialist palliative care services innovations and practice changes in response to COVID-19. DESIGN: Online survey of specialist palliative care providers (CovPall), disseminated via key stakeholders. Data collected on service characteristics, innovations and changes in response to COVID-19. Statistical analysis included frequencies, proportions and means, and free-text comments were analysed using a qualitative framework approach. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Inpatient palliative care units, home nursing services, hospital and home palliative care teams from any country. RESULTS: Four hundred and fifty-eight respondents: 277 UK, 85 Europe (except UK), 95 World (except UK and Europe), 1 missing country. 54.8% provided care across 2+ settings; 47.4% hospital palliative care teams, 57% in-patient palliative care units and 57% home palliative care teams. The crisis context meant services implemented rapid changes. Changes involved streamlining, extending and increasing outreach of services, using technology to facilitate communication, and implementing staff wellbeing innovations. Barriers included; fear and anxiety, duplication of effort, information overload and funding. Enablers included; collaborative teamwork, staff flexibility, a pre-existing IT infrastructure and strong leadership. CONCLUSIONS: Specialist palliative care services have been flexible, highly adaptive and have adopted low-cost solutions, also called ‘frugal innovations’, in response to COVID-19. In addition to financial support, greater collaboration is essential to minimise duplication of effort and optimise resource use.

The purpose of this study is to examine which socioeconomic status groups are most at risk of treatment interruption. Methods: This cross-sectional internet monitor study was conducted on December 22-26, 2020, when Japan experienced its third wave of COVID-19 infection. Out of a total of 33,302 participants in the survey, 9510 (5392 males and 4118 females) who responded that they required regular treatment or hospital visits were included in the analysis. A multilevel logistic model nested in the prefecture of residence was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for treatment disruption. We examined separate multivariate models for socioeconomic factors, health factors, and lifestyle factors. Results: During a period of rapid COVID-19 infection, about 11% of Japanese workers who required regular treatment experienced interruptions to their treatment. The OR of treatment interruption associated with not being married compared to being married was 1.44; manual labor work compared to desk work was 1.30; loss of employment when the COVID-19 pandemic started and continued unemployment compared to being employed over the entire pandemic period was 1.62 and 2.57, respectively; and feeling financially unstable was 2.92. Conclusion: Treatment interruption is a new health inequality brought about by COVID-19 with possible medium- and long-term effects, including excess mortality, morbidity, and productivity loss due to increased presenteeism.

In response, multinational partners have proposed programs to allocate vaccines to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Yet, there remains a substantial funding gap for such programs. Further, the optimal vaccine supply is unknown and the cost-effectiveness of investments into global vaccination programs has not been described. We used a validated COVID-19 simulation model8 to project the health benefits and costs of reaching 20%-70% vaccine coverage in 91 LMICs. We show that funding 20% vaccine coverage over one year among 91 LMICs would prevent 294 million infections and 2 million deaths, with 26 million years of life saved at a cost of US$6.4 billion, for an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$250/year of life saved (YLS). Increasing vaccine coverage up to 50% would prevent millions more infections and save hundreds of thousands of additional lives, with ICERs below US$8,000/YLS. Results were robust to variations in vaccine efficacy and hesitancy, but were more sensitive to assumptions about epidemic pace and vaccination costs. These results support efforts to fund vaccination programs in LMICs and complement arguments about health equity, economic benefits, and pandemic control11.","Siedner, M.

673666,Development of an Immunochromatographic Strip for Rapid Detection of Canine Adenovirus,2019-12-11,"One of the main roles of the prescription of physical activity for people with type 2 diabetes is to reduce hyperglycemia. The beneficial effect of physical training on glycemic levels is considered as the sum of the effects of each exercise session. A better understanding of acute responses to exercise, through short-term glycemic variability, could explain the differences in the results of distinct training protocols. The objective of this study was to analyze the scientific information on different exercise protocols and their association with short-term glycemic variability in patients with type 2 diabetes. A systematic review of studies published in English and Spanish was carried out. The databases used were PubMed, Cochrane, ScienceDirect, and Medline. Only studies conducted in adults (older than 18 years) were included. A total of 36 studies were identified, which were analyzed and completed using the Covidence® platform. The final analysis included 10 articles with 296 patients. The 10 included articles were divided according to the type of intervention protocol used: group 1, acute exercise, and group 2, training. Significant differences were found in glycemic variability in 71.4% of the articles in group 1 and in 100% of the articles included in group 2. Positive effects of acute exercise and physical training on short-term glycemic variability were demonstrated. The findings were more pronounced in the intervention protocols than in physical training.","von Oetinger G, A; Trujillo G, L M; Soto I, N",Rehabilitacion (Madr),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rh.2020.11.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33865613/,60

In this ecological study of 140 countries using publicly available national-level data, higher vaccine coverage, representing estimated proportion of people vaccinated during the last 15 years, was associated with lower COVID-19 deaths. The associations attenuated for both vaccine variables, and MCV coverage became no longer significant once adjusted for a validated summary score accounting for life expectancy and healthcare quality indicators, the Healthcare access and quality index (HAQI). The magnitude of association between BCG coverage and COVID-19 death rate varied according to HAQI, and MCV coverage had little effect on the association between BCG and COVID-19 deaths. While there are associations between live vaccine coverage and COVID-19 outcomes, the vaccine coverage variables themselves were strongly correlated with COVID-19 testing rate, HAQI, and life expectancy. This suggests that the population-level associations may be further confounded by differences in structural health systems and policies. Cluster randomized studies of booster vaccines would be ideal to evaluate the efficacy of trained immunity in preventing COVID-19 infections and mortality in vaccinated individuals and on community transmission.","Ogimi, Chikara; Qu, Pingping; Boeckh, Michael; Bender Ignacio, Rachel A.; Zangeneh, Sahar Z.",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.17.20214510; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.17.20214510v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33106815/,60
674112,Identification of cell lines permissive for human coronavirus NL63,2006-09-07,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) is a high-risk DNA tumour virus, which is a major causative agent of cervical cancer. Cellular transformation is associated with deregulated expression of the E6 and E7 oncogenes. E7 has been shown to bind a number of cellular proteins, including the cell cycle control protein pRb. In this study, RNA aptamers (small, single-stranded oligonucleotides selected for high-affinity binding) to HPV16 E7 were employed as molecular tools to further investigate these protein-protein interactions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study is focused on one aptamer (termed A2). Transfection of this molecule into HPV16-transformed cells resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation (shown using real-time cell electronic sensing and MTT assays) due to the induction of apoptosis (as demonstrated by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining). GST-pull down and bead binding assays were used to demonstrate that the binding of A2 required N-terminal residues of E7 known to be involved in interaction with the cell cycle control protein, pRb. Using a similar approach, A2 was shown to disrupt the interaction between E7 and pRb in vitro. Furthermore, transfection of HPV16-transformed cells with A2 appeared to result in the loss of E7 and rise in pRb levels, as observed by immunoblotting. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This paper includes the first characterisation of the effects of an E7 RNA aptamer in a cell line derived from a cervical carcinoma. Transfection of cells with A2 was correlated with the loss of E7 and the induction of apoptosis. Aptamers specific for a number of cellular and viral proteins have been documented previously; one aptamer (Macugen) is approved for clinical use and several others are in clinical trials. In addition to its role as a molecular tool, A2 could have further applications in the future.","Nicol, Clare; Cesur, Özlem; Forrest, Sophie; Belyaeva, Tamara A.; Bunka, David H. J.; Blair, G.

To date, little is known about how the restrictions affected sleep, which is commonly disturbed in bipolar disorder (BD). The aim of this study was to elucidate sleep patterns during the pandemic in Austrian BD individuals. METHODS: An online survey assessed sleep with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and COVID‐19‐associated attitudes, fears, and emotional distress of 20 BD individuals and 19 controls (HC) during the pandemic. The survey was conducted in April 2020, when very strict regulations were declared, and repeated in May, when they were loosened. RESULTS: Individuals with BD reported overall poor sleep according to PSQI sum at both time points. Subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, daytime sleepiness, and PSQI sum were worse in individuals with BD than in HC. Individuals with BD informed themselves more frequently about pandemic‐related topics. Higher information frequency and more COVID‐19 fears (about the virus, own infection, contracting others) correlated with worse PSQI values. Regression models found in BD group that higher information frequency as well as higher COVID‐19 fears in April predicted worse sleep characteristics in May, in particular subjective sleep quality, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and daytime sleepiness. CONCLUSION: As sufficient sleep duration and quality are essential for well‐being and particularly important for vulnerable BD individuals, it is important that information about the pandemic is gathered to a reasonable extent and mental health professionals include COVID‐19‐related fears when currently treating BD.","Fellendorf, Frederike T.; Reininghaus, Eva Z.; Ratzenhofer, Michaela; Lenger, Melanie; Maget, Alexander; Platzer, Martina; Bengesser, Susanne A.; Birner, Armin; Queissner, Robert; Hamm, Carlo; Pilz, Rene; Dalkner, Nina",Brain Behav,https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34409763/,60

It was found that there was a strong correlation between IgG antibody avidity and days since symptom onset (p < 0.0001). In addition, peak readings were significantly higher for specimens from ICU than non-ICU patients for the first month after symptom onset (1-4 weeks) and thereafter (p<0.0001). The findings are consistent for what has been reported for SARS-CoV. Given that SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG avidity is strong in ICU patients after 1 month, this suggests that antibody-mediated immune enhancement triggered by suboptimal antibodies may not play a role in COVID-19 disease progression and severity.","Luo, Y.

Design Observational cohort study. Setting An inner city NHS Hospital Trust in London, UK. Participants All adult inpatients hospitalised with COVID-19 who were referred to Speech and Language Therapy (SLT) for voice and/or swallowing assessment for 2 months from April 2020. Interventions SLT assessment, advice and therapy for dysphonia and dysphagia. Main Outcome Measures Evidence of delirium, neurological presentation, intubation, tracheostomy and proning history were collected, along with type of SLT provided and discharge outcomes. Therapy Outcome Measures (TOMs) were recorded for swallowing and tracheostomy pre/post SLT intervention and GRBAS for voice. Results 164 patients (104M), age 56.8±16.7y were included. Half (52.4%) had a tracheostomy, 78.7% had been intubated (mean 15±6.6days), 13.4% had new neurological impairment and 69.5% were delirious. Individualised compensatory strategies were trialled in all and direct exercises with 11%. Baseline assessments showed marked impairments in dysphagia and voice but there was significant improvement in all during the study (p<0.0001). On average patients started some oral intake 2 days after initial SLT assessment (IQR 0-8) and were eating and drinking normally on discharge but 29.3%(n=29)of those with dysphagia and 56.1% (n=37) of those with dysphonia remained impaired at hospital discharge. 70.9% tracheostomised patients were decannulated, median (IQR) time to decannulation 19 days(16-27).Across all (n=164), 37.3% completed SLT input while inpatients, 23.5% were transferred to another hospital, 17.1% had voice and 7.8% required community follow-up for dysphagia. Conclusions Inpatients with COVID-19 present with significant impairments of voice and swallowing, justifying responsive SLT. Prolonged intubations and tracheostomies were the norm and a minority had new neurological presentations. Patients typically improved with assessment that enabled treatment with individualised compensatory strategies. Services preparing for COVID-19 should target resources for tracheostomy weaning and to enable responsive management of dysphagia and dysphonia with robust referral pathways.","Archer, Sally K.; Iezzi, Christina M.; Gilpin, Louisa",Arch Phys Med Rehabil,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003999321000897; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2021.01.063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33529610/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003999321000897?v=s5,60

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional prospective study. SETTING: Tertiary hospital. METHODS: The fluctuations of respiratory virus detection were compared to the major climatic variables during a two-year period using adenoids and palatine tonsils from 172 children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy and clinical evidence of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome or recurrent adenotonsillitis, without symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI), by TaqMan real-time PCR. RESULTS: The rate of detection of at least one respiratory virus in adenotonsillar tissue was 87%. The most frequently detected viruses were human adenovirus in 52.8%, human enterovirus in 47.2%, human rhinovirus in 33.8%, human bocavirus in 31.1%, human metapneumovirus in 18.3% and human respiratory syncytial virus in 17.2%. Although increased detection of human enterovirus occurred in summer/autumn months, and there were summer nadirs of human respiratory syncytial virus in both years of the study, there was no obvious viral seasonality in contrast to reports with ARI patients in many regions of the world. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses are continuously highly detected during whole year, and without any clinical symptomatology, indicating that viral genome of some virus can persist in lymphoepithelial tissues of the upper respiratory tract.","Proença-Módena, José Luiz; Buzatto, Guilherme P.; Paula, Flávia E.; Saturno, Tamara H.; Delcaro, Luana S.; Prates, Mirela C.; Tamashiro, Edwin; Valera, Fabiana C.P.; Arruda, Eurico; Anselmo-Lima, Wilma T.",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2014.07.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25128448/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165587614004042; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165587614004042,60

678069,Immune responses in influenza A virus and human coronavirus infections: An ongoing battle between the virus and host,2018-02-01,"COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of deaths and a social-economic crisis. A worldwide effort was made to develop efficient vaccines for this disease. A vaccine should produce immune responses with specific and neutralizing antibodies, and without harmful effects such as the antibody-dependent enhancement that may be associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome. Vaccine design involves the selection of platforms that includes viral, viral-vector, protein, nucleic acid, or trained immunity-based strategies. Its development initiates at a pre-clinical stage, followed by clinical trials when successful. Only if clinical trials show no significant evidence of safety concerns, vaccines can be manufactured, stored, and distributed to immunize the population. So far, regulatory authorities from many countries have approved nine vaccines with phase 3 results. In the current pandemic, a paradigm for the COVID-19 vaccine development has arisen, as many challenges must be overcome. Mass-production and cold-chain storage to immunize large human populations should be feasible and fast, and a combination of different vaccines may boost logistics and immunization. In silico trials is an emerging and innovative field that can be applied to predict and simulate immune, molecular, clinical, and epidemiological outcomes of vaccines to refine, reduce, and partially replace steps in vaccine development. Vaccine-resistant variants of SARS-CoV-2 might emerge, leading to the necessity of updates. A globally fair vaccine distribution system must prevail over vaccine nationalism for the world to return to its pre-pandemic status.","Carneiro, Diego C.; Sousa, Jéssica D.; Monteiro-Cunha, Joana P.",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34015363/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170221001611; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.198454; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170221001611?v=s5,60
678175,Mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells,2021-10-05,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether video visits were being used as substitutes to clinic visits prior to COVID-19 at our institution's outpatient urology centers. METHODS: We reviewed 600 established patient video visits completed by 13 urology providers at a tertiary academic center in southeast Michigan. We compared these visits to a random, stratified sample of established patient clinic visits. We assessed baseline demographics and visit characteristics for both groups. We defined our primary outcome (“revisit rate”) as the proportion of additional healthcare evaluation (ie, office, emergency room, hospitalization) by a urology provider within 30 days of the initial encounter. RESULTS: Patients seen by video visit tended to be younger (51 vs 61 years, P <.001), would have to travel further for a clinic appointment (82 vs 68 miles, P <.001), and were more likely to be female (36 vs 28%, P = .001). The most common diagnostic groups evaluated through video visits were nephrolithiasis (40%), oncology (18%) and andrology (14.3%). While the 30-day revisit rates were higher for clinic visits (4.3% vs 7.5%, P = .01) primarily due to previously scheduled appointments, revisits due to medical concerns were similar across both groups (0.5% vs 0.67%; P = .60). CONCLUSIONS: Video visits can be used to deliver care across a broad range of urologic diagnoses and can serve as a substitute for clinic visits.","Andino, Juan J.; Lingaya, Mark-Anthony; Daignault-Newton, Stephanie; Shah, Parth K.; Ellimoottil, Chad",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2020.05.080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32619595/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0090429520307883; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090429520307883,60

678596,ProOmpA is stabilized for membrane translocation by either purified E. coli trigger factor or canine signal recognition particle,1988-09-23,"BACKGROUND: Italy was the first country to largely experience the COVID-19 epidemic among other Western countries during the so-called first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Proper management of an increasing number of home-quarantined individuals created a significant challenge for health care authorities and professionals. This was especially true when considering the importance of remote surveillance to detect signs of disease progression and consequently regulate access to hospitals and intensive care units on a priority basis. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we report on an initiative promoted to cope with the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Spring/Summer of 2020, in the Autonomous Province of Trento, Italy. A purposefully built app named TreCovid19 was designed to provide dedicated health care staff with a ready-to-use tool for remotely monitoring patients with progressive symptoms of COVID-19, who were home-quarantined during the first wave of the epidemic, and to focus on those patients who, based on their self-reported clinical data, required a quick response from health care professionals. METHODS: TreCovid19 was rapidly developed to facilitate the monitoring of a selected number of home-quarantined patients with COVID-19 during the very first epidemic wave. The app was built on top of an existing eHealth platform, already in use by the local health authority to provide home care, with the following functionalities: (1) to securely collect and link demographic and clinical information related to the patients and (2) to provide a two-way communication between a multidisciplinary health care team and home-quarantined patients. The system supported patients to self-assess their condition and update the multidisciplinary team on their health status. The system was used between March and June 2020 in the province of Trento. RESULTS: A dedicated multidisciplinary group of health care professionals adopted the platform over a period of approximately 3 months (from March-end to June 2020) to monitor a total of 170 patients with confirmed COVID-19 during home quarantine. All patients used the system until the end of the initiative. The TreCovid19 system has provided useful insights of possible viability and impact of a technological–organizational asset to manage a potentially critical workload for the health care staff involved in the periodic monitoring of a relevant number of quarantined patients, notwithstanding its limitations given the rapid implementation of the whole initiative. CONCLUSIONS: The technological and organizational model adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic was developed and finalized in a relatively short period during the initial few weeks of the epidemic. The system successfully supported the health care staff involved in the periodic monitoring of an increasing number of home-quarantined patients and provided valuable data in terms of disease surveillance.","Gios, Lorenzo; Crema Falceri, Giulia; Micocci, Stefano; Patil, Luigi; Testa, Sara; Sforzin, Simona; Turra, Ettore; Conforti, Diego; Malfatti, Giulia; Moz, Monica; Nicolini, Andrea; Guarda, Paolo; Bacchiega, Alessandro; Mion, Carlo; Marchesoni, Michele; Maimone, Rosa; Molini, Pietro Benedetto; Zanella, Alberto; Osmani, Venet; Mayora-Ibarra, Oscar; Forti, Stefano",JMIR Form Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33909586/; https://doi.org/10.2196/25713,60

This study aimed to assess the epidemiologic characteristics, risk factors, and outcomes of vRTI occurring in the period from conditioning to 100 days after allo-HSCT in the era of molecular testing. This study was a retrospective record review of patients who underwent allo-HSCT at Royal Melbourne Hospital between January 2010 and December 2015. Symptomatic patients were tested using respiratory multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to identify risk factors for vRTI and the risk of death or intensive care unit (ICU) admission, respectively. A total of 382 patients were reviewed, and 65 episodes of vRTI were identified in 56 patients (14.7%). Rhinovirus accounted for the majority of infections (69.2%). The majority of episodes presented initially with upper respiratory tract infection (58.5%), with 28.9% of them progressing to lower respiratory tract infection. Eleven episodes (16.9%) were associated with ICU admission. There were no deaths directly due to vRTI. Previous autologous HSCT was associated with an increased risk of vRTI (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 4.1). The risks of death (P = .47) or ICU admission (P = .65) were not significantly different by vRTI status. vRTI is common in the first 100 days after allo-HSCT and is associated with ICU admission.","Sim, Starling A.; Leung, Vivian K.Y.; Ritchie, David; Slavin, Monica A.; Sullivan, Sheena G.; Teh, Benjamin W.",Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1083879118301174; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1083879118301174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29530766/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2018.03.004,60
681905,Origin and cross-species transmission of bat coronaviruses in China,2020,"Introduction Covid-19 has placed an unprecedented demand on healthcare systems worldwide. A positive safety culture is associated with improved patient safety and in turn patient outcomes. To date, no study has evaluated the impact of Covid-19 on safety culture. Methods The Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) was used to investigate safety culture during Covid-19 at a large UK teaching hospital. Findings were compared with baseline data from 2017. Incident reporting from the year preceding the pandemic was also examined. Results Significant increases were seen in SAQ score for doctors and AHPs (p value) from baseline (p value). A decrease in SAQ was found in the nursing group. Largely due to perception of management and safety climate subscales. During Covid-19, on univariate regression analysis, female gender (p<0.001), age 40-49 years (p<0.01), non-white ethnicity (p<0.001), nursing job role (p<0.001) were all associated with lower SAQ scores. Training (p<0.001) and support (p<0.001) for redeployment were associated with higher SAQ scores. On multivariate analysis, non-disclosed gender (-0.13, -0.26-0.00), non-disclosed ethnicity (-0.11, -0.22-0.00), nursing role (-0.15, -0.24-0.06), and support (0.24, 0.07-0.4) persisted to significance. A significant decrease (p<0.003) was seen in error reporting after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Discussion Differences in reported safety culture may reflect perception of risk due to: occupational exposure, job function, or access to support services. Reductions in incident reporting may be due to increased workload, change in nature of work, or changing safety attitudes. Targeted high-quality support for redeployed staff may help improve safety during future pandemics.","Denning, M.; Goh, E.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with STEMI in the outbreak era (between January 23, 2020 and March 27, 2020), and the post era (between March 28, 2020, and July 31, 2020) in Suzhou Province, drawn from the China Chest Pain Center Database. RESULTS: 1965 STEMI admissions were enrolled. During the corresponding period of 2019 to the post COVID‐19 era, there were a 53% and 38% fall in admissions in outbreak and the post era. There remained a gap in actual number of admissions at 306 and the predicted number that might be at 497. An estimated 26 deaths due to STEMI would have been caused by not seeking health care while no one died from COVID‐19. The percentage of STEMI cases transferred by ambulance decreased from 9.3% to 4.2% (P=0.013). Door‐to‐balloon and the FMC‐to‐device median (q1, q3) time increased from 17.5 (10.0, 46.0) and 52.0 (12.0, 86.0) minutes to 34.0 (15.0, 48.0) and 63.0 (15.0, 94.0) minutes, respectively (p=0.001, p=0.005), and rate of PCI practice declined from 71.3% to 60.1% (p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The impact of public health restrictions in the post COVID‐19 era is significant, and may lead to unexpected out‐of‐hospital deaths and compromised quality of STEMI care. Delay or absence in presentation in STEMI patients should be continuously considered to avoid the secondary disaster of the pandemic. System delay should be modifiable for reversing the worse clinical outcomes from the COVID‐19 outbreak, by coordination measures with focus on the balance between timely PCI procedure and minimizing contamination of cardiac catheterization rooms.","Ma, Junxiong; Zhou, Suduo; li, Na; Dong, Xuejie; Maimaitiming, Mailikezhati; Jin, Yinzi; Zheng, Zhi‐Jie",Int J Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34022120/,60

Considering the barriers suffered by immigrants and non-English-speaking families, we tested whether children with a preferred language other than English was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Children from families with a preferred language other than English had a higher predicted probability of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity (adjusted odds ratio, 3.76; 95% CI, 2.07-6.67) during the first wave of the pandemic. This discrepancy continued into the second wave (adjusted odds ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.10-2.41), although the difference compared with families who prefer to speak English decreased over time.

In this work, our goal is to explore methods to estimate infection dates from sequence analysis. One such method, based on site stripping for clock detection, was proposed to unravel the clocklike molecular evolution in sequences showing high variability of evolutionary rates and in the presence of positive selection. Other alternatives imply accommodating heterogeneity in evolutionary rates at various levels, without eliminating any information from the data. Here we present the analysis of a data set of hepatitis C virus (HCV) sequences from 24 patients infected by a single individual with known dates of infection. We first used a simple criterion of relative substitution rate for site removal prior to a regression analysis. Time was regressed on maximum likelihood pairwise evolutionary distances between the sequences sampled from the source individual and infected patients. We show that it is indeed the fastest evolving sites that disturb the molecular clock and that these sites correspond to positively selected codons. The high computational efficiency of the regression analysis allowed us to compare the site-stripping scheme with random removal of sites. We demonstrate that removing the fast-evolving sites significantly increases the accuracy of estimation of infection times based on a single substitution rate. However, the time-of-infection estimations improved substantially when a more sophisticated and computationally demanding Bayesian method was used. This method was used with the same data set but keeping all the sequence positions in the analysis. Consequently, despite the distortion introduced by positive selection on evolutionary rates, it is possible to obtain quite accurate estimates of infection dates, a result of especial relevance for molecular epidemiology studies.","Wróbel, Borys; Torres-Puente, Manuela; Jiménez, Nuria; Bracho, María Alma; García-Robles, Inmaculada; Moya, Andrés; González-Candelas, Fernando",Mol Biol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16585120/,60

Several underlying pathologies have also been associated with splenic rupture, such as hematological diseases, malignancies, and infectious and inflammatory diseases. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 52-year-old man who referred to the Poursina Hospital in Rasht while complaining of abdominal pain from the day before hospitalization. The patient reported a history of lethargy, fever, and nausea. In the examinations performed, there was a brief tenderness in the patient’s epigastrium. The patient was monitored and about 12 h after hospitalization, ill appearance, respiratory (respiratory distress) symptoms, and high fever were reported for the patient. According to the examination, the patient was immediately transferred to the operating room and underwent laparotomy. During the operation, contrary to our expectations, a lot of blood (about 1000 cc) was observed in the patient’s abdomen. After blood suctioning, the left upper quadrant (LUQ) was bleeding and the rupture of the spleen could also be observed. Therefore, a splenectomy was performed. In the examinations performed for the patient, the patient’s rtPCR test confirmed COVID-19.

Studies on coronaviruses in general, and SARS in particular, have identified the virus spike protein (S) as being central to virus tropism, to the generation of a protective antibody response and to the unambiguous detection of past infections. As a result of this centrality SARS-CoV-2 S protein has a role in many aspects of research from vaccines to diagnostic tests. We describe a number of recombinant forms of SARS-CoV-2 S expressed in commonly available expression systems and their preliminary use in diagnostics and epitope mapping. These sources may find use in the current and future analysis of the virus and the Covid-19 disease it causes.","Jegouic, Sophie M.; Loureiro, Silvia; Thom, Michelle; Paliwal, Deepa; Jones, Ian M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.21.109298,60

This paper focuses on how residency programs have attempted to adjust to this vastly different application cycle by using social media to reach their applicants. A total of 138 programs were identified through the Electronic Residency Application Services. The presence of Departmental/Residency program Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook as well as web pages offering virtual opportunities was recorded for each program on October 30, 2020. A total of 132 social media accounts were found; the majority of which were on Twitter, while fewer were on Instagram and Facebook. All 138 pathology residency programs had websites. Sixteen (11.5%) of those advertised virtual open houses and 2 (1.4%) advertised virtual subinternships; social media were more often used for advertisement of these virtual experiences. A total of 58 open house opportunities were advertised on Twitter, 21 on Instagram, and 20 on Facebook. Innovative virtual subinternships ranging from 2 to 4 weeks were developed, but only represented 6% of the usual 126 away rotations available. Pathology programs across the country utilized websites and social media as a method of communication to interact with applicants as part of the #Path2Path in 2020 and to provide virtual opportunities in preparation for a drastically different recruitment cycle.","Cutshall, Hannah; Hattaway, Reagan; Singh, Nikhi P.; Rais-Bahrami, Soroush; McCleskey, Brandi",Acad Pathol,https://doi.org/10.1177/23742895211002783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192133/,60

The evolution of SARS-CoV-2, either in its natural reservoir or in the human population, is still unclear, but this knowledge is essential for effective prevention and control. We propose a new framework to systematically identify recombination events, excluding those due to noise and convergent evolution. We found that several recombination events occurred for SARS-CoV-2 before its transfer to humans, including a more recent recombination event in the receptor-binding domain. We also constructed a probabilistic mutation network to explore the diversity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 after human infection. Clustering results show that the novel coronavirus has diverged into several clusters that cocirculate over time in various regions and that several mutations across the genome are fixed during transmission throughout the human population, including D614G in the S gene and two accompanied mutations in ORF1ab. Together, these findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 experienced a complicated evolution process in the natural environment and point to its continuous adaptation to humans. The new framework proposed in this study can help our understanding of and response to other emerging pathogens.","Wang, Yinghan; Zeng, Jinfeng; Zhang, Chi; Chen, Cai; Qiu, Zekai; Pang, Jiali; Xu, Yutian; Dong, Zhiqi; Song, Yanxin; Liu, Weiying; Dong, Peipei; Sun, Litao; Chen, Yao-Qing; Shu, Yuelong; Du, Xiangjun",Brief Bioinform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33885735/; https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbab107,60

To facilitate antiviral screening against SARS-CoV-2 without requirement for high biosafety level facility, we developed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-vectored replicon of SARS-CoV-2, nCoV-SH01 strain, in which secreted Gaussia luciferase (sGluc) was encoded in viral subgenomic mRNA as a reporter gene. The replicon was devoid of structural genes spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E). Upon transfection, the replicon RNA replicated in various cell lines, and was sensitive to interferon alpha (IFN-α), remdesivir, but was resistant to hepatitis C virus inhibitors daclatasvir and sofosbuvir. Replication of the replicon was also sensitive overexpression of zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP). We also constructed a four-plasmid in-vitro ligation system that is compatible with the BAC system, which makes it easy to introduce desired mutations into the assembly plasmids for in-vitro ligation. This replicon system would be helpful for performing antiviral screening and dissecting virus-host interactions.","Zhang, Yang; Song, Wuhui; Chen, Shuiye; Yuan, Zhenghong; Yi, Zhigang",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.11.294330,60

We searched 5.7 million biologically diverse samples (10.2 petabases) for the hallmark gene RNA dependent RNA polymerase, identifying well over 105 novel RNA viruses and thereby expanding the number of known species by roughly an order of magnitude. We characterised novel viruses related to coronaviruses and to hepatitis δ virus, respectively and explored their environmental reservoirs. To catalyse a new era of viral discovery, we established a free and comprehensive database of these data and tools.

Robot assisted surgery (RAS) may help to reduce hospital stay for patients that urgently need complex-oncological-surgery, thus making room for COVID-19 patients. In comparison to open or conventional laparoscopic surgery, RAS potentially reduces not only contamination with body fluids and surgical gasses of the surgical area but also the number of directly exposed medical staff. A prerequisite is that general surgical precautions under COVID-19 circumstances must be taken, with the addition of prevention of gas leakage: • Use highest protection level III for bedside assistant, but level II for console surgeon. • Reduce the number of staff at the operation room. • Ensure safe and effective gas evacuation. • Reduce the intra-abdominal pressure to 8 mmHg or below. • Minimize electrocautery power and avoid use of ultrasonic sealing devices. • Surgeons should avoid contact outside theater (both in and out of the hospital).","Kimmig, Rainer; Verheijen, René H.M.; Rudnicki, Martin",J Gynecol Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3802/jgo.2020.31.e59; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32242340/,60

Current guidelines recommend low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for VTE prophylaxis in orthopaedic trauma patients. However, emerging literature in total joint arthroplasty patients suggests the potential clinical benefits of VTE prophylaxis with aspirin. The primary aim of this trial is to compare aspirin with LMWH as a thromboprophylaxis in fracture patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PREVENT CLOT is a multicentre, randomised, pragmatic trial that aims to enrol 12 200 adult patients admitted to 1 of 21 participating centres with an operative extremity fracture, or any pelvis or acetabular fracture. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality. We will evaluate non-inferiority by testing whether the intention-to-treat difference in the probability of dying within 90 days of randomisation between aspirin and LMWH is less than our non-inferiority margin of 0.75%. Secondary efficacy outcomes include cause-specific mortality, non-fatal PE and deep vein thrombosis. Safety outcomes include bleeding complications, wound complications and deep surgical site infections. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The PREVENT CLOT trial has been approved by the ethics board at the coordinating centre (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health) and all participating sites. Recruitment began in April 2017 and will continue through 2021. As both study medications are currently in clinical use for VTE prophylaxis for orthopaedic trauma patients, the findings of this trial can be easily adopted into clinical practice. The results of this large, patient-centred pragmatic trial will help guide treatment choices to prevent VTE in fracture patients.

To conduct population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in the United States, the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) was created using the existing infrastructure of the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) (4) and the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET). This report presents age-stratified COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates for patients admitted during March 1-28, 2020, and clinical data on patients admitted during March 1-30, 2020, the first month of U.S. surveillance. Among 1,482 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 74.5% were aged ≥50 years, and 54.4% were male. The hospitalization rate among patients identified through COVID-NET during this 4-week period was 4.6 per 100,000 population. Rates were highest (13.8) among adults aged ≥65 years. Among 178 (12%) adult patients with data on underlying conditions as of March 30, 2020, 89.3% had one or more underlying conditions; the most common were hypertension (49.7%), obesity (48.3%), chronic lung disease (34.6%), diabetes mellitus (28.3%), and cardiovascular disease (27.8%). These findings suggest that older adults have elevated rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and the majority of persons hospitalized with COVID-19 have underlying medical conditions. These findings underscore the importance of preventive measures (e.g., social distancing, respiratory hygiene, and wearing face coverings in public settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain)† to protect older adults and persons with underlying medical conditions, as well as the general public. In addition, older adults and persons with serious underlying medical conditions should avoid contact with persons who are ill and immediately contact their health care provider(s) if they have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) (5). Ongoing monitoring of hospitalization rates, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalized patients will be important to better understand the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 in the United States and the clinical spectrum of disease, and to help guide planning and prioritization of health care system resources.","Garg, Shikha; Kim, Lindsay; Whitaker, Michael; O’Halloran, Alissa; Cummings, Charisse; Holstein, Rachel; Prill, Mila; Chai, Shua J.; Kirley, Pam D.; Alden, Nisha B.; Kawasaki, Breanna; Yousey-Hindes, Kimberly; Niccolai, Linda; Anderson, Evan J.; Openo, Kyle P.; Weigel, Andrew; Monroe, Maya L.; Ryan, Patricia; Henderson, Justin; Kim, Sue; Como-Sabetti, Kathy; Lynfield, Ruth; Sosin, Daniel; Torres, Salina; Muse, Alison; Bennett, Nancy M.; Billing, Laurie; Sutton, Melissa; West, Nicole; Schaffner, William; Talbot, H.

The prepared filter media was analyzed through a scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The effectiveness of the filter media was evaluated through the zone of inhibition and antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus. The Box-Behnken design is experimented with three-level variables, namely areal density of substrate (GSM), electrospinning time (hours), and concentration of TNT (wt%) for investigating the bacterial filtration efficiency through an Andersen sampler. Among other statistical tests (STATs), PVDF + 15 wt% TNT has a bacterial filtration efficiency of 99.88% providing greater potentials upon application for clean air management.

689531,Evaluation of candidate vaccine approaches for MERS-CoV,2015-07-28,"PURPOSE: The on-going COVID-19 pandemic has curtailed the established practice norms of many ailments including clubfoot. We conducted a survey to study the changes in the clubfoot treatment practices, Achilles tenotomy methods, and the role along with the possible impact of teleconsultation during this pandemic. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted using a questionnaire prepared on Google forms. The link for this questionnaire was sent to Indian Orthopaedic specialists with a special interest in clubfoot management via a social messaging platform. RESULTS: 127 eligible responses were analysed. Of them, 67% respondents were in practice for more than 10 years. During the study period, 30.7% of doctors did not perform any casting; 66.9% performed casting in 1–5 cases per week and only 2.4% performed casting in more than five cases per week. A statistically significant difference was noted in the number of doctors who performed casting in less than five cases per week and the doctors who performed casting in more than five cases per week, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. 30.7% of doctors deferred doing Achilles tenotomy during the study period, and among those who performed one, a significant number of them avoided tenotomy under general anaesthesia. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted clubfoot treatment practices during the lockdown period in India. Significant reductions in the number of cases, and a reduction with changes in Achilles tenotomy practices were noted too. However, whether this had any adverse influence on the eventual outcome in these feet is yet to be determined.

The resulting parameter values were used to simulate lockdown outcomes for a wide range of start times and durations. Lockdowns were simulated as intervention strategies that modified weights assigned to social contact matrices for work, school and other places. Lockdown efficacy was assessed by the maximum number of infections recorded during a simulation run. Our analysis shows that lockdown outcomes depend sensitively on the timing of imposition and that it is possible to minimize lockdown durations while limiting case loads to numbers below the hospitalization thresholds.

It does so by deploying a multi-step investigation of the issues from four perspectives: transportation corridors, spheres of influence, centrality, and observed spatial patterns – each leading us to connections between retail spaces and planning of African cities. Our analyses of 22 traditional satellite markets in Kumasi are distilled into four key findings. First, these markets emerge along, and at the intersection of, intra- and inter-urban road networks as a means of granting local access to indigenous goods and services. Second, the spatial distribution and spheres of influence of the markets partly support Christaller's hypothesis regarding the willingness of people to travel far distances to access higher-order goods and services. The hypothesis fails, however, to recognize that some traditional markets can still have high spheres of influence without providing higher-order goods and services because they constitute vital nodes in the rural-urban food networks. Third, we find a spatial clustering of these markets, suggesting agglomerative tendencies among the markets. Finally, we argue that the observed spatio-social patterns of Kumasi's retailscape only make sense if they are situated within the city's modernist urban planning imaginaries. Specifically, the city's retailscape embodies ongoing placemaking strategies, which involve the expropriation of urban spaces from traders to modernize the cityscape.","Frimpong Boamah, Emmanuel; Amoako, Clifford; Asenso, Barbara Kuffuor",Appl Geogr,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622819305326; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0143622819305326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834206/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102265,60
