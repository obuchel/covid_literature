For the first time in modern history, a global vaccination campaign has started worldwide in a short period of time and with products that were recently developed. Consequently, legitimate concerns regarding the safety and tolerability of COVID-19 vaccines arise.In line with international allergy societies, the Belgian Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BelSACI) provides this statement to guide health care providers (general practitioners, specialists including allergists) and stakeholders.In this statement, we first review current evidence on allergic reactions to vaccines and the potential risk factors that have been identified.Second, we provide a risk stratification method that may be used as a worksheet during the vaccination campaign.Finally, we discuss the management of suspected or confirmed allergic reactions following vaccination.","Tuyls, Sebastiaan; Van Der Brempt, Xavier; Faber, Margaretha; Gadisseur, Romy; Dezfoulian, Bita; Schrijvers, Rik; Froidure, Antoine",Acta clinica Belgica,https://doi.org/10.1080/17843286.2021.1909447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33792500/,830

To explore caregivers' experiences managing MNTs in the postacute home health care (HHC) setting, we interviewed by phone 20 caregivers of older adults who received HHC following a hospitalization. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using directed content analysis. Caregivers highlighted the technical complexity and emotional impact of performing MNTs, as well as social (e.g., family, friends) and environmental (e.g., neighborhood, housing) resources they leveraged to meet the older adults' care needs. Caregivers also identified challenges coordinating care and services within HHC and the larger health care system. Caregiver engagement in the postacute HHC setting should incorporate tailored training and support, assessments of socioenvironmental context and resources, and facilitated navigation of the health care system. Future research should elucidate factors associated with successful collaborative relationships among HHC providers, older adults, and their caregivers in the postacute HHC setting.","Chase, Jo-Ana D; Russell, David; Kaplan, Daniel B; Bueno, Michael V; Khiewchaum, Rungnapha; Feldman, Penny H",Journal of applied gerontology : the official journal of the Southern Gerontological Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/0733464820961259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985303/,830

101225,ESCAIDE 2015: an operational scientific conference on infectious diseases for professionals from Europe and beyond.,2016,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Flow diverter stents (FDSs) are increasingly used for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Initially developed for the management of giant and large aneurysms, their indications have progressively expanded. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of FDSs for the treatment of anterior cerebral artery (ACA) aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Among the 94 consecutive patients treated for 100 intracranial aneurysms by means of FDSs in our institution from October 2010 to January 2015, eight aneurysms (8 %) in seven patients were located on the ACA. Three aneurysms were located on the A1 segment, three aneurysms on the anterior communicating artery (ACom) and two on the A2-A3 junction. In three cases, FDS was used for angiographic recurrence after coiling. Five patients were treated with a Pipeline embolization device, one with a NeuroEndograft and the last one with a Silk FDS. RESULTS Treatment was feasible in all cases. No technical difficulty was reported. No acute or delayed clinical complication was recorded. Modified Rankin Scale was 0 for six patients and one for one patient. Mean angiographic follow-up was 9.7 ± 3.9 months (range 6-15). Total exclusion was observed in five aneurysms (71.4 %) and neck remnant in two (28.6 %) cases. One patient refused the control DSA. CONCLUSION Our series shows the safety and effectiveness of FDSs for the treatment of ACA aneurysms.","Clarençon, F; Di Maria, F; Gabrieli, J; Shotar, E; Zeghal, C; Nouet, A; Chiras, J; Sourour, N-A",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-015-0441-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26250557/,830

In the case of Greece, health sector reform and health spending cuts have already had a major impact on costly interventions, particularly in surgical practice. An increase in utilization of public health resources, lack of basic and advanced surgical supplies, salary deductions, and emerging issues in patient management have contributed to serious dysfunction of a public health system unable to sustain current needs. In this context, significant implications arise for the surgeons and patients as proper perioperative management is directly affected by reduced public health funding. The surgical community has expressed concerns about the quality of surgical care and the future of surgical progress in the era of the European Union. Greek surgeons are expected to support reform while maintaining a high level of surgical care to the public. The challenge of cost control in surgical practice provides, nevertheless, an excellent opportunity to reconsider health economics while innovation through a more traditional approach to the surgical patient should not be precluded. A Greek case study on the extent of the current situation is presented with reference to health policy reform, serving as an alarming paradigm for the global community under the pressure of a profound financial recession.","Karidis, Nikolaos P; Dimitroulis, Dimitrios; Kouraklis, Gregory",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-011-1228-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21879425/,830

DESIGN Mixed methods study. SETTING A tertiary-care teaching hospital, Sydney, January 2018-February 2019. PARTICIPANTS 72 of 90 medical interns consented to participate. Of these, 39 completed all three time points. INTERVENTIONS Participants received a standard infection prevention and control (IPC) education module during their hospital orientation. They were then allocated alternately to a control or video group. At three time points (TPs) over the year, participants were asked to don/doff PPE items based on hospital protocol. At the first two TPs, all participants also participated in a reflexive discussion. At the second and third TPs, all participants were audited on their performance. The only difference between groups was that the video group was videoed while donning/doffing PPE, and they watched this footage as a stimulus for reflexive discussion. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES The efficacy and acceptability of the intervention were assessed using: (1) comparisons of audit performance between and within groups over time, (2) comparisons between groups on survey responses for evaluation of training and self-efficacy and (3) thematic analysis of reflexive discussions. RESULTS Both groups improved in their PPE competence over time, although there was no consistent pattern of significant differences within and between groups. No significant differences were found between groups on reported acceptability of training, or self-efficacy for PPE use. However, analysis of reflexive discussions shows that the effects of the video-reflexive intervention were tangible and different in important respects from standard training. CONCLUSIONS Video reflexivity in group-based training can assist new clinicians in engagement with, and better understanding of, IPC in their clinical practice. Our study also highlights the need for ongoing and targeted IPC training during medical undergraduate studies as well as regular workplace refresher training.","Wyer, Mary; Hor, Su-Yin; Barratt, Ruth; Gilbert, G L",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052985; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34635528/,830

The treatment of early glottic cancer includes radiotherapy, open surgery and laryngeal laser microsurgery. However, the preferred treatment for early glottic cancer is still controversial. OBJECTIVES To study the factors affecting the 5-year survival rate of Tis-2N0M0 early glottis cancer and to demonstrate the oncological safety of different treatments. METHODS 144 patients with early glottic cancer were analyzed retrospectively. All patients were clinically node negative. 53 patients underwent open surgery, transoral CO2 laser microsurgery in 46 cases and radiotherapy in 45 cases. The patients were followed up for 26 - 84 months, with an average follow-up period of 62.9 months. RESULTS The 5-year overall survival was 82.6%. The 5 year survival rates of open surgery, laser microsurgery and radiotherapy were 83.0%, 82.6% and 82.2%, respectively. There was no significant difference in 5-year survival rate among the three treatments (p = 0.987). In multivariate analysis, age, T-stage, pathological grading, and anterior commissure involvement were important prognostic factors for early glottic cancer. CONCLUSIONS There was no significant difference in 5 year survival rate among patients treated by either radiotherapy, laser microsurgery or open surgery for early glottic cancer. We urge more attention to the age, T-stage, pathological grade, and anterior commissure involvement of the patients.","Wang, Guanyu; Li, Guodong; Wu, Jianjun; Song, Penghui",Brazilian journal of otorhinolaryngology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjorl.2020.06.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830100/,830

147749,"Occupational risk of COVID-19 in the first versus second epidemic wave in Norway, 2020.",2021-10-01,"Nonstructural proteins 7 and 8 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have previously been shown by X-ray crystallography to form an 8:8 hexadecamer. In addition, it has been demonstrated that N-terminally His(6)-tagged SARS-CoV Nsp8 is a primase able to synthesize RNA oligonucleotides with a length of up to 6 nucleotides. We present here the 2.6-Å crystal structure of the feline coronavirus (FCoV) Nsp7:Nsp8 complex, which is a 2:1 heterotrimer containing two copies of the α-helical Nsp7 with conformational differences between them, and one copy of Nsp8 that consists of an α/β domain and a long-α-helix domain. The same stoichiometry is found for the Nsp7:Nsp8 complex in solution, as demonstrated by chemical cross-linking, size exclusion chromatography, and small-angle X-ray scattering. Furthermore, we show that FCoV Nsp8, like its SARS-CoV counterpart, is able to synthesize short oligoribonucleotides of up to 6 nucleotides in length when carrying an N-terminal His(6) tag. Remarkably, the same protein harboring the sequence GPLG instead of the His(6) tag at its N terminus exhibits a substantially increased, primer-independent RNA polymerase activity. Upon addition of Nsp7, the RNA polymerase activity is further enhanced so that RNA up to template length (67 nucleotides) can be synthesized. Further, we show that the unprocessed intermediate polyprotein Nsp7-10 of human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E is also capable of synthesizing oligoribonucleotides up to a chain length of six. These results indicate that in case of FCoV as well as of HCoV 229E, the formation of a hexadecameric Nsp7:Nsp8 complex is not necessary for RNA polymerase activity. Further, the FCoV Nsp7:Nsp8 complex functions as a noncanonical RNA polymerase capable of synthesizing RNA of up to template length.","Xiao, Yibei; Ma, Qingjun; Restle, Tobias; Shang, Weifeng; Svergun, Dmitri I; Ponnusamy, Rajesh; Sczakiel, Georg; Hilgenfeld, Rolf",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.06635-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22318142/,830

152681,Comparison of serological assays in human Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-coronavirus infection.,2015,"BACKGROUND As a common social phenomenon, nurses' occupational burnout has a high incidence rate, which seriously affects their mental health and nursing level. The current assessment mostly uses the total score model and explores the influence of external factors on burnout, while the correlation between burnout items or dimensions is less explored. Ignoring the correlation between the items or dimensions may result in a limited understanding of nurse occupational burnout. This paper explores the item and dimension network structure of the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS) in Chinese nurses, so as to gain a deeper understanding of this psychological construct and identify potential targets for clinical intervention. METHODS A total of 493 Chinese nurses were recruited by cluster sampling. All participants were invited to complete the survey on symptoms of burnout. Network analysis was used to investigate the item network of MBI-GS. In addition, community detection was used to explore the communities of MBI-GS, and then network analysis was used to investigate the dimension network of MBI-GS based on the results of community detection. Regularized partial correlation and non-regularized partial correlation were used to describe the association between different nodes of the item network and dimension network, respectively. Expected influence and predictability were used to describe the relative importance and the controllability of nodes in both the item and dimension networks. RESULTS In the item network, most of the strongly correlated edges were in the same dimension of emotional exhaustion (E), cynicism (C) and reduced professional efficacy (R), respectively. E5 (Item 5 of emotional exhaustion, the same below) ""I feel burned out from my work"", C1 ""I have become more callous toward work since I took this job"", and R3 ""In my opinion, I am good at my job"" had the highest expected influence (z-scores = 0.99, 0.81 and 0.94, respectively), indicating theirs highest importance in the network. E1 ""I feel emotionally drained from my work"" and E5 had the highest predictability (E1 = 0.74, E5 = 0.74). It shows that these two nodes can be interpreted by their internal neighbors to the greatest extent and have the highest controllability in the network. The spinglass algorithm and walktrap algorithm obtained exactly the same three communities, which are consistent with the original dimensions of MBI-GS. In the dimension network, the emotional exhaustion dimension was closely related to the cynicism dimension (weight = 0.65). CONCLUSIONS The network model is a useful tool to study burnout in Chinese nurses. This study explores the item and domain network structure of nurse burnout from the network perspective. By calculating the relevant indicators, we found that E5, C1, and R3 were the most central nodes in the item network and cynicism was the central node in the domain network, suggesting that interventions aimed at E5, C1, R3 and cynicism might decrease the overall burnout level of Chinese nurses to the greatest extent. This study provides potential targets and a new way of thinking for the intervention of nurse burnout, which can be explored and verified in clinical practice.","Wu, Lin; Ren, Lei; Wang, Yifei; Zhang, Kan; Fang, Peng; Liu, Xufeng; Yang, Qun; Wang, Xiuchao; Wu, Shengjun; Peng, Jiaxi",BMC nursing,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-021-00670-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34404401/,830
158655,"Preparing for imported Ebola cases in Israel, 2014 to 2015.",2015,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic calls for effective control and prevention. Chinese medicine (CM) has developed systematic theories and approaches for infectious disease prevention over 2000 years. Here, we review and analyze Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) used in infectious disease prevention from ancient pestilences to modern epidemics and pandemics to share cumulative preventive medical experience. A total of 829 formulas, including 329 herbs from 189 ancient books, 131 formulas with 152 herbs, and 13 Chinese patent medicines (CPM) from 30 official Chinese prevention programs used in ancient epidemics, SARS, influenza and COVID-19 prevention, were reviewed and analyzed. Preventive CHM mainly has four functions and can be taken orally or applied externally. CHM that kill pathogens (Realgar [Xionghuang], Cyrtomium Fortunei J. Sm[Guanzhong]) were commonly used externally for disinfection in ancient prevention while CHM tonifying Qi (Astragali Radix [Huangq], Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma [Gancao]) are used for modern prevention. Taking CHM that expel pathogens (Realgar [Xionghuang], Lonicerae Japonicae Flos[Jinyinhua]) and CHM eliminating dampness (Atractylodis Rhizoma [Cangzhu], Pogostemonis Herba[Guanghuoxiang]) have been commonly used from ancient times to COVID-19. Damp toxins are a common characteristic of infectious diseases such as SARS and COVID-19. Thus, taking CHM expelling damp toxins and tonifying Qi are the main methods for SARS and COVID-19 prevention. CHM with different approaches have been widely used in infectious disease prevention from ancient times to the present. Multiple CM prevention methods may provide new perspectives for future pandemics.","Wu, Xia-Qiu; Zhang, Wei-Na; Hao, Ming-Zhao; Liu, Xi-Ping; Xiao, Jing; Wang, Teng-Fei; Dong, Yi-Zhi; Zhao, Jing",The American journal of Chinese medicine,https://doi.org/10.1142/s0192415x2150049x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34107860/,830

Activist coalitions challenged the deadly impact of stigma, discrimination, and inadequate access to life-saving substance use disorder (SUD) and mental health care. Advocacy by coalitions resulted in federal and state funding and legislation, improving access to care. New York State is a model for these reforms. Occupational safety and health activists have largely been absent from this critical policy work even though 70% of people who are struggling with substance use are working. Antiquated workplace policies discipline workers who have substance use problems, silencing those who need support. Pain related to hazardous and stressful work are drivers of the crisis. Prevention and recovery-friendly workplace programs are part of the solution.

We tried to find ways to ensure the necessary continuation of treatment and to provide continuity in times of uncertainty. The vulnerable group of people treated for mental illnesses faced exceptional psychological demands and was in need for care in these moments. Telemedicine, more specifically telepsychiatry, through online therapy and telephone communication made it possible for people treated for psychotic disorders not to feel isolated and rejected. Health care professionals, in a state of distress themselves, should understand, support, be able to reduce anxiety, and provide stability and constancy. The psychotherapeutic approach and the capacity for mentalization allowed us to turn challenges into opportunities.

Timely and effective management can prevent disease progression to cirrhosis and reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Currently, there is no consensus on the clinical management of CHB in East Asia. AIM To establish an East Asia expert opinion on treatment initiation for CHB based on alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, hepatitis B virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) level, cirrhosis and HCC risk scores. METHODS A meeting was held online with a panel of 10 experts from East Asia to discuss ALT, HBV DNA, cirrhosis and HCC risk scores. Indications for CHB treatment in the latest international guidelines were reviewed. Consensus was summarised to provide recommendations on the initiation of treatment for CHB. RESULTS Anti-viral therapy is recommended for CHB patients with (a) HBV DNA ≥ 2000 IU/mL and ALT ≥ 1× upper limit of normal (ULN); (b) HBV DNA ≥ 2000 IU/mL, ALT < 1× ULN and ≥ F2 fibrosis and/or ≥ A2 necroinflammation occurs; (c) cirrhosis and detectable HBV DNA; or (d) HBV DNA ≥ 2000 IU/mL, ALT < 1× ULN and a family history of cirrhosis or HCC, extrahepatic manifestations or age > 40 years. Patients with cirrhosis and/or HCC should be treated regardless of ALT levels if HBV DNA level is detectable. Initiating anti-viral therapy or close monitoring at 3-month intervals is recommended for CHB patients with at least two HCC risk factors.

183349,"A case of imported Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus infection and public health response, Greece, April 2014.",2014,"Z-number that proposed by Zadeh is an effective tool to describe the information with uncertainty in decision-making problems. However, most of the researches on Z-numbers employed linguistic cardinalities with uniformly distributed scales. In fact, unbalance situation is much common in terms of the psychology of experts. In this paper, we propose a new computational method based on Probabilistic Linguistic Z-number with Unbalanced semantics(UPLZ), which can represent the linguistic evaluations of experts precisely combined with individual risk appetite. A new score function of UPLZs is provided based on hesitant degree and linguistic scale function to reduce the computational complexity. Afterward, a linear programming is constructed to determine weights of criteria by considering cross entropy maximization. The robust decision result can be obtained by applying MULTIMOORA method since it is specific with peculiarities of three subordinate models. Finally, a case study concerning medicine selection for the patients with mild symptoms of the COVID-19 is provided to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The advantages of it are highlighted by sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis with two outstanding multi-criteria decision-making methods.","Zhang, X. Z.; Mao, J. J.; Lu, Y.

Endoscopic activity has had frequent disruptions during this pandemic. The objective of the study was to see the influence of pandemic over the endoscopic activity. Methods: This retrospective analysis of endoscopic activity was undertaken at Nishtar Hospital Multan. Procedural analysis was done in the three months immediately after covid lockdown (1st April till 30th June 2020) and was compared to a similar period one year back. Results: Five hundred and fifty-four (68.5%) patients underwent endoscopic procedures during the three months of pre-COVID era, while this number reduced to half (n=255, 31.5%) patients during the covid pandemic. Even though the absolute number of Esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGDs) reduced during the pandemic, patients were more likely to undergo EGDs during the COVID pandemic in contrast to the era before the pandemic (79% versus 66%, p = 0.002). The most common indication for EGD was upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The percentage of EGDs done for UGIB rose from almost 60% to 80% during the covid pandemic (p < 0.001). The most common findings were esophageal varices and portal gastropathy (non-significant difference during and before the pandemic). Percentage of ERCPs done for obstructive jaundice doubled during the COVID pandemic (33% versus 65%, p = 0.002).The most common indication for sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy was lower gastrointestinal bleeding. However, no significant difference was found before and during the covid pandemic (41.7% and 45.8% respectively, p=0.72). Internal hemorrhoids were the most common endoscopic finding. Colon cancer diagnosis reduced from 10% to undetected during the pandemic period. Conclusion: COVID pandemic resulted in a considerable reduction in all types of endoscopic procedures. The majority of procedures were done for emergency indications like gastrointestinal bleeding. Rates of cancer detection were significantly reduced.

Patients admitted in the same time period in 2019 served as controls. All data were collected from the medical files. Admissions were classified as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non-ST-elevation ACS (NSTEACS). Total and weekly admissions and invasive procedures were assessed. Mean incidence difference (MID) in weekly ACS admissions and procedures was also calculated. RESULTS: Overall, 781 patients were included in this analysis: 321 patients (37%) were admitted during study period and 550 patients (63%) were admitted during the control period (overall reduction of 41.6%;weekly MID of 28.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 13.3 to 44.0;p = 0.001). The occurrence of all ACS types was reduced: STEMI, by 28.1%;weekly MID 7.3 [0.6-15.2];p = 0.048];NSTEACS by 50.5%, weekly MID 19.1 [13.9-24.4];p <0.001]. Invasive procedures were also reduced: coronary angiography by 42.5%, weekly MID 26.6 [13.4-39.2];p = 0.001];percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) by 42.3%, weekly MID 16.1 [5.9-26.3], p = 0.004]. Compared to 2019, during the COVID-19 period, there was a 2.4 fold increase in the inhospital death (3% vs 7.2%) with a significant weekly MID 1.4 [0.2-2.7) P=0.032]. A 2.6-fold increase in the occurrence of cardiogenic shock was also observed (13.1% vs. 5.1%, p <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The admissions for ACS and invasive revascularization procedures were significantly reduced, whereas the death rate was increased during COVID 19 pandemic outbreak in Albania compared with the same period in 2019. © 2021 Leonard Simoni, Ilir Alimehmeti, Astrit Ceka, Ermir Tafaj, Mirald Gina, Alban Dibra, Artan Goda.","Simoni, L.; Alimehmeti, I.; Ceka, A.; Tafaj, E.; Gina, M.; Dibra, A.; Goda, A.",Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3889/oamjms.2021.6269,830

184405,Why a burden of disease study?,2007,"Objectives: COVID-19 policies have been employed in Denmark since March 2020. We examined whether COVID-19 restrictions had an impact on Chlamydia trachomatis infections compared with 2018 and 2019. Methods: This retrospective nation-wide Danish observational study was performed using monthly incidences of laboratory confirmed chlamydia cases and number of tests, obtained from nation-wide surveillance data. Additionally, Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker data, and Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports were used to contextualise the behavioural adaptions seen as a result of COVID-19 policies. Testing rates were compared using Poisson regression and test positivity rates were compared using logistic regression. Results: The crude incidence rate (IR) of laboratory confirmed chlamydia infections was reduced to 66.5 per 105 during the first (March-April 2020) lockdown period as compared to 88.3 per 105 in March-April 2018-2019, but the testing rate was also reduced (Rate ratio 0.72 95% CI 0.71-0.73), whereas the odds ratio for a positive test between the two periods was 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-1.00). The period of eased COVID 19 restrictions (May-December 2020) and the second lockdown period (December 2020-March 2021) were characterised by marginally increased crude IRs, while the number of tests performed, and test positivity rates returned very close to the levels seen in 2018-2019. These results were independent of sex, age group, and geographical location. Conclusion: The first Danish COVID-19 lockdown resulted in a reduction in the number of chlamydia tests performed and a consequent reduction in the number of laboratory-identified cases. This period was followed by a return of testing and test positivity close to the level seen in 2018-2019. Altogether the Danish COVID-19 restrictions have had negligible effects on laboratory confirmed C. trachomatis transmission.","Hedley, P.

Here we provide theoretical evidence for the hypothesis that genetic fragility evolves as a consequence of the pervasive population bottlenecks experienced by viral populations at various stages of their life cycles. Modelling within-host viral populations as multi-type branching processes, we show that mutational fragility lowers the rate at which Muller’s ratchet clicks and increases the survival probability through multiple bottlenecks. In the context of a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered epidemiological model, we find that the attack rate of fragile viral strains can exceed that of more robust strains, particularly at low infectivities and high mutation rates. Our findings highlight the importance of demographic events such as transmission bottlenecks in shaping the genetic architecture of viral pathogens.","Merleau, Nono S.

The taste organs of phytophagous insects contain bitter gustatory receptors (GRs). To explore their function, we focused on PxylGr34, a bitter GR in Plutella xylostella (L.). We detected abundant PxylGr34 transcripts in the larval head and specific expression of PxylGr34 in the antennae of females. Analyses using the Xenopus oocyte expression system and two-electrode voltage-clamp recording showed that PxylGr34 is specifically tuned to the plant hormone brassinolide (BL) and its analog 24-epibrassinolide. Electrophysiological analyses revealed that the medial sensilla styloconica on the maxillary galea of the 4th instar larvae are responsive to BL. Dual-choice bioassays demonstrated that BL inhibits larval feeding and female ovipositing. Knock-down of PxylGr34 by RNAi abolished BL-induced feeding inhibition. These results shed light on gustatory coding mechanisms and deterrence of insect feeding and ovipositing, and may be useful for designing plant hormone-based pest management strategies.","Yang, Ke; Gong, Xin-Lin; Li, Guo-Cheng; Huang, Ling-Qiao; Ning, Chao; Wang, Chen-Zhu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.13.200048,830

Meanwhile, the availability of anonymized and aggregated mobility data provides an opportunity to obtain a deeper understanding of the impact of these measures. In this paper, we utilize an open mobility dataset called Community Mobility Report published by Google on the Internet and other external data sources (e.g., statistics on daily confirmed cases, demographics, etc.) to quantitatively characterize people’s collective responses and model it with a proposed metric called Lockdown Stringency Score (LSS) after the lockdown measures have been taken. Then, by investigating the correlations between LSS and the increase of new confirmed cases across different regions and countries in the world, we explore how people’s collective response in terms of mobility pattern changes affects the control of the virus. The analysis results show that lockdown and social distancing measures do have a positive impact on virus control, and the restriction on different types of Point-of-Interests (PoIs) has different weights (significance) in terms of virus control effectiveness. These results reveal important insights and implication on public health policy making, such as the phased start of the lockdown or reopen of the economy. © 2021 IEEE.","Li, K.; Wang, J.; Liu, Z.; Zhang, Y.; Xie, Z.","45th IEEE Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference, COMPSAC 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/compsac51774.2021.00089,830

185298,"Timeliness of epidemiological outbreak investigations in peer-reviewed European publications, January 2003 to August 2013.",2015,"Background: There is growing evidence that social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH) play a substantial effect in a wide range of health outcomes. Electronic health records (EHRs) have been widely employed to conduct observational studies in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). However, there has been little research into how to make the most of SBDH information from EHRs. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in six databases to find relevant peer-reviewed publications that had recently been published. Relevance was determined by screening and evaluating the articles. Based on selected relevant studies, a methodological analysis of AI algorithms leveraging SBDH information in EHR data was provided. Results: Our synthesis was driven by an analysis of SBDH categories, the relationship between SBDH and healthcare-related statuses, and several NLP approaches for extracting SDOH from clinical literature. Discussion: The associations between SBDH and health outcomes are complicated and diverse; several pathways may be involved. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to support the extraction of SBDH and other clinical ideas simplifies the identification and extraction of essential concepts from clinical data, efficiently unlocks unstructured data, and aids in the resolution of unstructured data-related issues. Conclusion: Despite known associations between SBDH and disease, SBDH factors are rarely investigated as interventions to improve patient outcomes. Gaining knowledge about SBDH and how SBDH data can be collected from EHRs using NLP approaches and predictive models improves the chances of influencing health policy change for patient wellness, and ultimately promoting health and health equity.

The article discusses variables affecting innovation adoption and analyses selected organisational culture factors in terms of their impact on innovation adoption in Polish IT companies. A novelty here is a study of their impact separately at each stage of innovation. The objective was to assess the perception of the impact of selected organisational culture factors on adoption of innovation by Polish IT industry staff at different stages. Due to the complexity of the different research aspects, a method triangulation strategy was used, combining survey techniques, desk research, expert opinions and statistical analysis. The survey used an original questionnaire called “The Process of Innovation Adoption and Perception” to examine opinions on 15 organisational culture factors in the context of innovation adoption. The research confirmed that selected organisational culture factors have a different impact on innovation adoption at different stages of innovation introduction in the Polish IT industry. On this basis, groups of factors perceived similarly in terms of innovation adoption at the individual stages were identified, forming guidelines for the proper implementation of innovation in Polish IT companies.","Ober, Józef",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12208630,830

We hypothesized that significantly more VLBW infants who were receiving dopamine > or =10 microg/kg per min could wean off vasopressor support 72 hours after treatment with hydrocortisone. METHODS A double-blind, randomized, controlled study was conducted in a university neonatal center. Forty-eight VLBW infants who had refractory hypotension and required dopamine > or =10 microg/kg per min were randomly assigned to receive a stress dose of hydrocortisone (1 mg/kg every 8 hours for 5 days; n = 24) or an equivalent volume of the placebo solution (isotonic saline; n = 24). RESULTS The baseline clinical characteristics were similar between the groups. Serum cortisol concentrations were very low immediately before randomization in both groups of infants. Significantly more VLBW infants who were treated with hydrocortisone weaned off vasopressor support 72 hours after starting treatment. The use of volume expander, cumulative dose of dopamine, and dobutamine were significantly less in hydrocortisone-treated infants compared with control infants. In addition, the median duration of vasopressor treatment was halved in hydrocortisone-treated patients. Two versus 11 infants in the hydrocortisone and control groups required a second vasopressor for treatment of refractory hypotension. The trend (linear and quadratic) of the mean arterial blood pressure was also significantly and consistently higher in hydrocortisone-treated infants. CONCLUSIONS A stress dose of hydrocortisone was effective in treating refractory hypotension in VLBW infants. Although routine and prophylactic use of systemic corticosteroids could not be recommended because of their potential adverse effects, this relatively low dose of hydrocortisone would probably be preferable to high-dose dexamethasone for treatment of refractory hypotension in emergency and life-threatening situations.","Ng, Pak C; Lee, Cheuk H; Bnur, Flora Liu; Chan, Iris H S; Lee, Anthony W Y; Wong, Eric; Chan, Hin B; Lam, Christopher W K; Lee, Benjamin S C; Fok, Tai F",Pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16452355/,830

This review highlights advances in our understanding of the etiology of Kawasaki's disease, the immune response leading to vascular damage, potential biomarkers, and insights into mechanisms of disease addressed by an animal model. Clinical dilemmas are discussed in the context of the new American Heart Association recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of Kawasaki's disease. RECENT FINDINGS Improved understanding of the mechanisms of disease will assist in identifying predisposed individuals and in development of more effective therapy. Most investigators agree that an infectious trigger leads to massive activation of the immune system, resulting in a prolonged self-directed immune response at the coronary arteries. The etiology debate has centered on the nature of and mechanisms involved in immune activation. Genetic studies have not provided conclusive answers to these questions. Mechanistic studies done in animal models have pointed to specific biologic factors critical for coronary artery damage and together with studies in children may lead to more rationally conceived biologically based interventions. Increasingly, the questions regarding clinical management address timing of therapy and the management of children presenting with atypical Kawasaki's disease. New guidelines and management algorithms have been proposed by the American Heart Association to address these concerns.

OBJECTIVES To examine the managerial challenges, actions taken, and insights of directors of ophthalmology departments in Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We conducted a cross sectional survey of directors of ophthalmology departments during the COVID-19 pandemic while the Israeli population was quarantined. RESULTS All 21 directors answered the survey. The majority of the COVID-19 admissions were located in the center of Israel (53%) and Jerusalem (30%). E-communication took a central role in coping with the pandemic with 80% of the directors satisfied with this form of communication; 75% reported a reduction in clinical and surgery volume of at least 25%, and 40% reported reallocations of manpower. Most of the medical staff used gloves, a face shield, disposable robe, and a mask with no uniformity across departments. Cross satisfaction was noted regarding a hospital's ability to equip the departments. Lack of preparation for post-pandemic era was reported by all directors, but one (95%).

187689,Public health crises: the development of a consensus document on their management in Spain.,2011,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW To review recent publications relevant to hospital disinfection (and cleaning) including the reprocessing of medical instruments. RECENT FINDINGS The key question as to whether the use of disinfectants on environmental surfaces rather than cleaning with detergents only reduces nosocomial infection rates still awaits conclusive studies. New disinfectants, mainly peroxygen compounds, show good sporicidal properties and will probably replace more problematical substances such as chlorine-releasing agents. The safe reprocessing of medical devices requires a well-coordinated approach, starting with proper cleaning. New methods and substances show promising activity for preventing the transmission of prions. Different aspects of virus inactivation have been studied, and the transmissibility, e.g. of norovirus, shows the need for sound data on how different disinfectant classes perform. Biofilms or other forms of surface-adherent organisms pose an extraordinary challenge to decontamination. Although resistance to biocides is generally not judged to be as critical as antibiotic resistance, scientific data support the need for proper use, i.e. the avoidance of widespread application, especially in low concentrations and in consumer products. SUMMARY Chemical disinfection of heat-sensitive instruments and targeted disinfection of environmental surfaces are established components of hospital infection control. To avoid danger to staff, patients and the environment, prudent use as well as established safety precautions are required. New technologies and products should be evaluated with sound methods. As emerging resistant pathogens will challenge healthcare facilities in the future even more than at present, there is a need for well-designed studies addressing the role of disinfection in hospital infection control.","Dettenkofer, Markus; Block, Colin",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15985828/,830

The UTRs are identical to those in the viral genome, since the 2.2-kb DI RNA is composed of only the two ends of the genome fused between an internal site within the 738-nucleotide (nt) 5'-most coding region (the nsp1, or p28, coding region) and a site just 4 nt upstream of the 3'-most open reading frame (ORF) (the N gene). The joined ends of the viral genome in the DI RNA create a single continuous 1,635-nt ORF, 288 nt of which come from the 738-nt nsp1 coding region. Here, we have analyzed features of the 5'-terminal 288-nt portion of the nsp1 coding region within the continuous ORF that are required for DI RNA replication. We observed that (i) the 5'-terminal 186 nt of the nsp1 coding region are necessary and sufficient for DI RNA replication, (ii) two Mfold-predicted stem-loops within the 186-nt sequence, named SLV (nt 239 to 310) and SLVI (nt 311 to 340), are supported by RNase structure probing and by nucleotide covariation among closely related group 2 coronaviruses, and (iii) SLVI is a required higher-order structure for DI RNA replication based on mutation analyses. The function of SLV has not been evaluated. We conclude that SLVI within the BCoV nsp1 coding region is a higher-order cis-replication element for DI RNA and postulate that it functions similarly in the viral genome.","Brown, Cary G; Nixon, Kimberley S; Senanayake, Savithra D; Brian, David A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17475638/,830

188892,Rabies remains a 'neglected disease'.,2005,"INTRODUCTION Wheezing in children not older than 24 months of age is a frequent event, and viruses are usually the causative agents. The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of respiratory viruses in wheezing children who were not older than 24 months of age and who had no history of asthma. METHODS Fifty-five Mexican children were included in an analytical cross-sectional study. Nasal secretions were obtained by using sterile rayon-tipped applicators to identify the virus by polymerase chain reaction or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction: adenovirus, bocavirus, human rhinovirus, influenza virus type A, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. The prevalence of viral etiology was estimated by dividing the frequency of the identified virus by the number of participants. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for proportions were calculated. RESULTS Most of the patients were male (35/55, 63.6%). The average time of evolution of wheezing episode was 3 days. The third part of enrolled population were receiving antibiotics. Respiratory viruses were detected in 33 (60%; 95% CI: 46.8-71.9%) out of 55 cases, and viral coinfection was detected in five cases (9.1%; 95% CI: 3.5-19.9%). Human metapneumovirus was the most frequently identified virus (23.6%), followed by bocavirus (14.5%), respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus (12.7% each), and to a lesser extent influenza virus type A and parainfluenza. Rhinovirus was the predominant virus in outpatient children (28.6%). In the inpatient emergency room and inhalotherapy room, human metapneumovirus predominated (41.2 and 16.1%, respectively). CONCLUSION bocavirus and human metapneumovirus were the most frequently identified viruses in Mexican children who were < 2 years of age, suffered from wheezing, and had no history of asthma.","Bedolla-Barajas, Martín; Montero, Hilda; Morales-Romero, Jaime; Landa-Cardeña, Adriana; Díaz, Jahaziel; Delgado-Figueroa, Netzahualpilli; Orozco-Alatorre, Luis Gustavo",Gaceta medica de Mexico,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28763071/,830

To enable the rapid and biosafe identification of coronavirus replicase inhibitors, we have generated a non-cytopathic, selectable replicon RNA (based on human CoV 229E) that can be stably maintained in eukaryotic cells. Most importantly, the replicon RNA mediates reporter gene expression as a marker for coronavirus replication. We have used a replicon RNA-containing cell line to test the inhibitory effect of several compounds that are currently being assessed for SARS treatment. Amongst those, interferon-alpha displayed the strongest inhibitory activity. Our results demonstrate that coronavirus replicon cell lines provide a versatile and safe assay for the identification of coronavirus replicase inhibitors.

191144,"Contact investigation of a case of human novel coronavirus infection treated in a German hospital, October-November 2012.",2013,"OBJECTIVE Internationally, there was a warning of the risk of increased domestic violence during lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including child-to-parent violence. The objective of our study was to assess the prevalence of different violent behaviors from children to parents during pre-lockdown, lockdown and immediately after, between March 14 and June 20, 2020, and to assess differences in behaviors between pre-lockdown and lockdown and between pre-lockdown and post-lockdown. METHODS The researchers developed a survey with closed questions about different violent behaviors of the children (poor responses, insults and physical aggression). This was distributed with the CAWI methodology during the months of August and September 2020 to a sample of Spanish parents stratified by autonomous communities. 1,500 families with 1,927 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years participated. The frequency of responses obtained between the pre-lockdown and lockdown and between pre-lockdown and post-lockdown was compared through the Mac Nemar test for comparison of related samples. RESULTS The prevalences of poor responses, insults and aggressions in a pre-lockdown setting were 30.1%, 3.8% and 0.6%, respectively. Poor responses and insults increased significantly between pre-lockdown and lockdown (p<0.001) and between pre-lockdown and post-lockdown (p<0.001) in all autonomous communities, age groups, genders, occupation type of the adolescent and type of household. No statistically significant differences were found in physical aggression for the periods evaluated. Single-parent families, adolescents residing in subsidized housing and those without an occupation or education (""NEET"") exhibited more violent behavior in the three periods. CONCLUSIONS Lockdown led to an increase in nonphysical violent behaviors, which were maintained to the end, warning of the potentially persistent risks of lockdown in this age group, especially in vulnerable families.","Royo Isach, Jordi; Masana Marín, Adela; Busquets Rams, Isabel; Feliu Zapata, M Angels; Baliarda Hernández, Cristina; Ivern, Jan; Vilella, Elisabet; Muntané, Gerard",Revista espanola de salud publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34620819/,830
191547,The ethics of sharing preliminary research findings during public health emergencies: a case study from the 2009 influenza pandemic.,2014,"We have obtained biochemical and electron microscopic evidence of conformational changes at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C in the coronavirus spike glycoprotein E2 (S). The importance of these changes is reflected in the loss of virus infectivity, the aggregation of virions, and increased virus-induced cell fusion at the same pH. Coronavirus (MHV-A59) infectivity is exquisitely sensitive to pH. The virus was quite stable at pH 6.0 and 37 degrees C (half-life, approximately 24 h) but was rapidly and irreversibly inactivated by brief treatment at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C (half-life, approximately 30 min). Virions treated at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C formed clumps and large aggregates. With virions treated at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C, the amino-terminal peptide E2N (or S1) was released from virions and the remaining peptide, E2C (S2), was aggregated. Viral spikes isolated from detergent-treated virions also aggregated at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C. Loss of virus infectivity and E2 (S) aggregation at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C were markedly enhanced in the presence of dithiothreitol. On the basis of the effects of dithiothreitol on the reactions of the peplomer, we propose that release of E2N (S1) and aggregation of E2C (S2) may be triggered by rearrangement of intramolecular disulfide bonds. The aggregation of virions and the isolated E2 (S) glycoprotein at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C or following treatment with guanidine and urea at pH 6.0 and 37 degrees C indicate that an irreversible conformational change has been induced in the peplomer glycoprotein by these conditions. It is interesting that coronavirus-induced cell fusion also occurred under mildly alkaline conditions and at 37 degrees C. Some enveloped viruses, including influenza viruses and alphaviruses, show conformational changes of spike glycoproteins at a low pH, which correlates with fusion and penetration of those viruses in acidified endocytic vesicles. For coronavirus MHV-A59, comparable conformational change of the spike glycoprotein E2 (S) and cell fusion occurred at a mildly alkaline condition, suggesting that coronavirus infection-penetration, like that of paramyxoviruses and lentiviruses, may occur at the plasma membrane, rather than within endocytic vesicles.","Sturman, L S; Ricard, C S; Holmes, K V",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2159562/,830

SIS is used to repair musculoskeletal tissue while promoting cell migration and supporting tissue regeneration. Polypropylene mesh is a non-resorbable synthetic material that can endure mechanical tension. Canine SIS was obtained from donor German shepherds, and its porous collagen fiber structure was identified using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A 2.50-cm(2) section of canine SIS (SIS group) or mesh (mesh group) was implanted in Sprague-Dawley rats. At 1, 2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks after surgery, the implants were histopathologically examined and tensile load was tested. One month after surgery, CD68+ macrophage numbers in the SIS group were increased, but the number of CD8+ T cells in this group declined more rapidly than that in rats treated with the mesh. In the SIS group, few adhesions and well-developed autologous abdominal muscle infiltration into the SIS collagen fibers were observed. No significant differences in the tensile load test results were found between the SIS and mesh groups at 24 weeks. Canine SIS may therefore be a suitable replacement for artificial biological scaffolds in small animals.","Lee, A-Jin; Lee, Sung-Ho; Chung, Wook-Hun; Kim, Dae-Hyun; Chung, Dai-Jung; Do, Sun Hee; Kim, Hwi-Yool",Journal of veterinary science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23628657/,830

We evaluated a cost-effective strategy for SARS-CoV-2 testing to determine point prevalence in a rural community with a generally low prevalence of infection. METHODS We voluntarily tested asymptomatic clinic employees and conducted 2 community SARS-CoV-2 testing events in Cashton, Wisconsin, that included testing for asymptomatic persons. We also partnered with local clinics and public health departments to conduct weekly drive-up clinics for asymptomatic, high-risk persons identified through enhanced contact tracing. This was possible as testing capacity in Wisconsin never reached its maximum, and we continued symptomatic testing through our clinic. RESULTS We tested 61 employees, 268 individuals at 2 community events, 36 high-risk asymptomatic people at drive-up clinic events, and 128 symptomatic people within our clinic. We observed 1 positive result in asymptomatic people and 5 positive results in symptomatic patients, confirming the low prevalence in our area. CONCLUSIONS Our testing events confirmed a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing prevalence information to local businesses and schools. We reinforced our partnership with local public health departments to facilitate enhanced contact tracing and test asymptomatic persons, and we provided a service to asymptomatic persons requiring testing for travel, school, or work.

191920,Evaluation of syndromic surveillance in the Netherlands: its added value and recommendations for implementation.,2011,"Coronaviruses have a positive-strand RNA genome and replicate through the use of a 3' nested set of subgenomic mRNAs each possessing a leader (65 to 90 nucleotides [nt] in length, depending on the viral species) identical to and derived from the genomic leader. One widely supported model for leader acquisition states that a template switch takes place during the generation of negative-strand antileader-containing templates used subsequently for subgenomic mRNA synthesis. In this process, the switch is largely driven by canonical heptameric donor sequences at intergenic sites on the genome that match an acceptor sequence at the 3' end of the genomic leader. With experimentally placed 22-nt-long donor sequences within a bovine coronavirus defective interfering (DI) RNA we have shown that matching sites occurring anywhere within a 65-nt-wide 5'-proximal genomic acceptor hot spot (nt 33 through 97) can be used for production of templates for subgenomic mRNA synthesis from the DI RNA. Here we report that with the same experimental approach, template switches can be induced in trans from an internal site in the DI RNA to the negative-strand antigenome of the helper virus. For these, a 3'-proximal 89-nt acceptor hot spot on the viral antigenome (nt 35 through 123), largely complementary to that described above, was found. Molecules resulting from these switches were not templates for subgenomic mRNA synthesis but, rather, ambisense chimeras potentially exceeding the viral genome in length. The results suggest the existence of a coronavirus 5'-proximal partially double-stranded template switch-facilitating structure of discrete width that contains both the viral genome and antigenome.","Wu, Hung-Yi; Brian, David A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17229702/,830

D-RNAs expressing the CAT gene were demonstrated to be capable of producing CAT protein in a helper-dependent expression system to about 1.6 microgram per 10(6) cells. The reporter genes were expressed from two different sites within the CD-61 sequence and expression was not affected by interruption of the CD-61-specific ORF. Expression of the reporter genes was under the control of a transcription-associated sequence (TAS) derived from the Beaudette gene 5, normally used for the transcription of IBV subgenomic mRNA 5. The Beaudette gene 5 TAS is composed of two tandem repeats of the IBV canonical consensus sequence involved in the acquisition of a leader sequence during the discontinuous transcription of IBV subgenomic mRNAs. It is demonstrated that only one canonical sequence is required for expression of mRNA 5 or for the expression of an mRNA from a D-RNA and that either sequence can function as an acceptor site for acquisition of the leader sequence.","Stirrups, K; Shaw, K; Evans, S; Dalton, K; Casais, R; Cavanagh, D; Britton, P",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10859373/,830
195706,A note from the editors: changes and stability--looking back to 2012 and forward to 2013.,2013,"Acute hypercytokinaemia represents an imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and is believed to be responsible for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure in severe cases of avian (H5N1) influenza. Although neuraminidase inhibitors are effective in treating avian influenza, especially if given within 48 h of infection, it is harder to prevent the resultant hypercytokinaemia from developing if the patient does not seek timely medical assistance. Steroids have been used for many decades in a wide variety of inflammatory conditions in which hypercytokinaemia plays a role, such as sepsis and viral infections, including severe acquired respiratory syndromes and avian influenza. However, to date, the results have been mixed. Part of the reason for the discrepancies might be the lack of understanding that low doses are required to prevent mortality in cases of adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency, as defined in the sepsis/shock literature, is a plasma cortisol rise of at least 9 microg dl(-1) following a 250 microg dose of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), or reaching a plasma cortisol concentration of >25 microg dl(-1) following a 1-2 microg dose of ACTH. In addition, in the case of hypercytokinaemia induced by potent viruses, such as H5N1, systemic inflammation-induced, acquired glucocorticoid resistance is likely to be present. Adrenal insufficiency can be overcome, however, with prolonged (7-10 or more days) supraphysiological steroid treatment at a sufficiently high dose to address the excess activation of NF-kappaB, but low enough to avoid immune suppression. This is a much lower dose than has been typically used to treat avian influenza patients. Although steroids cannot be used as a monotherapy in the treatment of avian influenza, there might be a potential role for their use as an adjunct treatment to antiviral therapy if appropriate dosages can be determined. In this paper, likely mechanisms of adrenal insufficiency are discussed, drawing from a broad background of literature sources.","Carter, Marissa J",Journal of medical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17577050/,830

We characterize visits with respect to symptoms and testing in the outpatient setting. METHODS A retrospective chart review of sick visits in a pediatric academic primary care clinic April-August 2020. We included possible COVID-19 cases, or ""persons under investigation"" (PUIs), recording symptoms, positive contacts, and COVID-19 testing. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for comparisons were used. RESULTS 32% (476/1,474) of sick visits were PUIs; 20% were telehealth. Symptoms most commonly reported were fever, congestion/rhinorrhea and cough. 76% of PUIs were tested for COVID-19. Only presence of COVID-19 contacts and loss of taste/smell were significantly associated with positive tests (p<0.001). CONCLUSION Nearly a third of sick visits in an academic pediatric practice were seen for possible COVID-19 symptoms and most were tested. The majority with and without COVID-19 had fever, congestion and/or cough. Our findings suggest low thresholds for testing in children.","Riese, Alison; Kelly, Jessica M; Chu, Tzu-Chun; Heinly, Allison; Kamath, Shuba; Golova, Natalia; Watts, Delma-Jean",Rhode Island medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323879/,830

The University of Miami Global Institute/Project Medishare (UMGI/PM) established the first field hospital in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, after the earthquake. To characterize injuries and surgical procedures performed by UMGI/PM and assess specialized medical, surgical, and rehabilitation needs, UMGI/PM and CDC conducted a retrospective medical record review of all available inpatient records for the period January 13-May 28, 2010. This report describes the results of that review, which indicated that, during the study period (when a total of 1,369 admissions occurred), injury-related diagnoses were recorded for 581 (42%) admitted patients, of whom 346 (60%) required a surgical procedure. The most common injury diagnoses were fractures/dislocations, wound infections, and head, face, and brain injuries. The most common injury-related surgical procedures were wound debridement/skin grafting, treatment for orthopedic trauma, and surgical amputation. Among patient records with documented injury-related mechanisms, 162 (28%) indicated earthquake-related injuries. Earthquake preparedness planning for densely populated areas in resource-limited settings such as Haiti should account for injury-related medical, surgical, and rehabilitation needs that must be met immediately after the event and during the recovery phase, when altered physical and social environments can contribute to a continued elevated need for inpatient management of injuries.",,MMWR.

Conjugated and unconjugated oligomers were tested to determine sequence-specific antiviral efficacy against a member of the Coronaviridae, Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Specific antisense activity designed to block translation of the viral replicase polyprotein was first confirmed by reduction of luciferase expression from a target sequence-containing reporter construct in both cell-free and transfected cell culture assays. Peptide-conjugated morpholino-oligomers exhibited low toxicity in DBT astrocytoma cells used for culturing MHV. Oligomer administered at micromolar concentrations was delivered to >80% of cells and inhibited virus titers 10- to 100-fold in a sequence-specific and dose-responsive manner. In addition, targeted viral protein synthesis, plaque diameter, and cytopathic effect were significantly reduced. Inhibition of virus infectivity by peptide-conjugated morpholino was comparable to the antiviral activity of the aminoglycoside hygromycin B used at a concentration fivefold higher than the oligomer. These results suggest that this composition of antisense compound has therapeutic potential for control of coronavirus infection.","Neuman, Benjamin W; Stein, David A; Kroeker, Andrew D; Paulino, Amy D; Moulton, Hong M; Iversen, Patrick L; Buchmeier, Michael J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15140987/,830

198159,"SARS: retrospective cohort study among German guests of the Hotel 'M', Hong Kong.",2003,"Human adenovirus serotype 4 (HAdV-4) is a reemerging viral pathogenic agent implicated in epidemic outbreaks of acute respiratory disease (ARD). This report presents a genomic and bioinformatics analysis of the prototype 35,990-nucleotide genome (GenBank accession no. AY594253). Intriguingly, the genome analysis suggests a closer phylogenetic relationship with the chimpanzee adenoviruses (simian adenoviruses) rather than with other human adenoviruses, suggesting a recent origin of HAdV-4, and therefore species E, through a zoonotic event from chimpanzees to humans. Bioinformatics analysis also suggests a pre-zoonotic recombination event, as well, between species B-like and species C-like simian adenoviruses. These observations may have implications for the current interest in using chimpanzee adenoviruses in the development of vectors for human gene therapy and for DNA-based vaccines. Also, the reemergence, surveillance, and treatment of HAdV-4 as an ARD pathogen is an opportunity to demonstrate the use of genome determination as a tool for viral infectious disease characterization and epidemic outbreak surveillance: for example, rapid and accurate low-pass sequencing and analysis of the genome. In particular, this approach allows the rapid identification and development of unique probes for the differentiation of family, species, serotype, and strain (e.g., pathogen genome signatures) for monitoring epidemic outbreaks of ARD.","Purkayastha, Anjan; Ditty, Susan E; Su, Jing; McGraw, John; Hadfield, Ted L; Tibbetts, Clark; Seto, Donald",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15681456/,830

655713,RBD-Fc-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate induces highly potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response,2020-11-27,"The coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses of animals and humans associated mostly with enteric and respiratory diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome and 10–20% of all common colds. A subset of CoVs uses the cell surface aminopeptidase N (APN), a membrane-bound metalloprotease, as a cell entry receptor. In these viruses, the envelope spike glycoprotein (S) mediates the attachment of the virus particles to APN and subsequent cell entry, which can be blocked by neutralizing antibodies. Here we describe the crystal structures of the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of two closely related CoV strains, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory CoV (PRCV), in complex with their receptor, porcine APN (pAPN), or with a neutralizing antibody. The data provide detailed information on the architecture of the dimeric pAPN ectodomain and its interaction with the CoV S. We show that a protruding receptor-binding edge in the S determines virus-binding specificity for recessed glycan-containing surfaces in the membrane-distal region of the pAPN ectodomain. Comparison of the RBDs of TGEV and PRCV to those of other related CoVs, suggests that the conformation of the S receptor-binding region determines cell entry receptor specificity. Moreover, the receptor-binding edge is a major antigenic determinant in the TGEV envelope S that is targeted by neutralizing antibodies. Our results provide a compelling view on CoV cell entry and immune neutralization, and may aid the design of antivirals or CoV vaccines. APN is also considered a target for cancer therapy and its structure, reported here, could facilitate the development of anti-cancer drugs.","Reguera, Juan; Santiago, César; Mudgal, Gaurav; Ordoño, Desiderio; Enjuanes, Luis; Casasnovas, José M.",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22876187/,830
