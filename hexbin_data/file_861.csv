Additionally, it has great potential to be used as an alternative to antimicrobial drugs, which is significant in the context of antibiotic abuse in food animal production. In this study, we isolated one strain of B. subtilis, named WS-1, from apparently healthy pigs growing with sick cohorts on one Escherichia coli endemic commercial pig farm in Guangdong, China. WS-1 can strongly inhibit the growth of pathogenic E. coli in vitro. The B. subtilis strain WS-1 showed typical Bacillus characteristics by endospore staining, biochemical test, enzyme activity analysis, and 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Genomic analysis showed that the B. subtilis strain WS-1 shares 100% genomic synteny with B. subtilis with a size of 4,088,167 bp. Importantly, inoculation of newborn piglets with 1.5 × 1010 CFU of B. subtilis strain WS-1 by oral feeding was able to clearly inhibit diarrhea (p < 0.05) and death (p < 0.05) caused by pathogenic E. coli in piglets. Furthermore, histopathological results showed that the WS-1 strain could protect small intestine from lesions caused by E. coli infection. Collectively, these findings suggest that the probiotic B. subtilis strain WS-1 acts as a potential biocontrol agent protecting pigs from pathogenic E. coli infection. Importance: In this work, one B. subtilis strain (WS-1) was successfully isolated from apparently healthy pigs growing with sick cohorts on one E. coli endemic commercial pig farm in Guangdong, China. The B. subtilis strain WS-1 was identified to inhibit the growth of pathogenic E. coli both in vitro and in vivo, indicating its potential application in protecting newborn piglets from diarrhea caused by E. coli infections. The isolation and characterization will help better understand this bacterium, and the strain WS-1 can be further explored as an alternative to antimicrobial drugs to protect human and animal health.","Du, Yunping; Xu, Zhichao; Yu, Guolian; Liu, Wei; Zhou, Qingfeng; Yang, Dehong; Li, Jie; Chen, Li; Zhang, Yun; Xue, Chunyi; Cao, Yongchang",Frontiers in microbiology,861,19

We recruited consecutive treatment naïve male patients with moderate to severe OSA from January to November of 2019. We excluded participants if they had dementia, stroke or heart disease. We collected demographic variables and vascular risk factors. We also obtained the insomnia severity index, the Epworth sleepiness scale and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index. We also obtained computerized neurocognitive testing with the go-no-go response inhibition test, Stroop interference test, catch game test, staged information processing speed test, verbal memory test and non-verbal memory test. We derived age and education adjusted domain-specific Z-scores for global cognition, memory, attention, processing speed and executive function. We used brain MRI T1-weighted images to derive total hippocampal and gray matter volumes. Partial correlations evaluated associations between variables from sleep questionnaires (e.g., insomnia severity index score), and polysomnographic variables (the apnea-hypopnea index, average oxygen levels during sleep) with cognitive domains and brain volumes. We examined 16 participants with an age range of 40-76 years, 73% Hispanic/Latino. The mean apnea-hypopnea index was 48.9 ± 25.5 and average oxygen saturation during sleep was 91.4% ± 6.9%. Hypertension was seen in 66% and diabetes mellitus in 27%. We found that the insomnia severity index score and average oxygen levels during sleep had the strongest correlations with brain volumes and cognition. These preliminary findings may aid in developing future strategies to improve age-related brain loss in patients with OSA.","Ramos, Alberto R; Alperin, Noam; Lee, Sang; Gonzalez, Kevin A; Tarraf, Wassim; Hernandez-Cardenache, Rene",Applied sciences,861,31

Public health guidelines in many countries are suggesting that people stay at home to avoid human-to-human transmission of the virus, which may lead to reduced physical activity and greater feelings of isolation. Such effects may be particularly problematic in older adults due to their reduced physical capacities and their potential for increased mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression. A potential way to minimize many of these side effects of stay-at-home guidelines may be progressive home-based resistance training. A simple way to provide progressive overload in home-based resistance training may involve elastic resistance, which has been demonstrated to provide similar benefits to traditional resistance training equipment typically found in gymnasiums. Recommendations on how older adults can safely and effectively perform elastic resistance training at home are provided.","Marcos-Pardo, Pablo Jorge; Espeso-García, Alejandro; López-Vivancos, Abraham; Abelleira Lamela, Tomás; Keogh, Justin W L",Journal of aging and physical activity,861,1

Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of revascularization therapy in patients with unclear-onset stroke in the anterior circulation and to identify the predictive factors for favorable clinical outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 41 consecutive patients presenting with acute stroke with unknown time of onset treated by intravenous thrombolysis and/or mechanical thrombectomy. Only patients without well-developed fluid-attenuated inversion recovery changes of acute diffusion lesions on MR imaging were enrolled. Twenty-one patients were treated by intravenous thrombolysis; 19 received, simultaneously, intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy (as a bridging therapy); and 1 patient, endovascular therapy alone. Clinical outcome was evaluated at 90 days by using the mRS. Mortality and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were also reported. RESULTS Median patient age was 72 years (range, 17-89 years). Mean initial NIHSS score was 14.5 ± 5.7. Successful recanalization (TICI 2b-3) was assessed in 61% of patients presenting with an arterial occlusion, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 2 patients (4.9%), and 3 (7.3%) patients died. After 90 days, favorable outcome (mRS 0-2) was observed in 25 (61%) patients. Following multivariate analysis, initial NIHSS score (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.13-1.82; P = .003) and bridging therapy (OR, 37.92; 95% CI, 2.43-591.35; P = .009) were independently associated with a favorable outcome at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS The study demonstrates the safety and good clinical outcome of acute recanalization therapy in patients with acute stroke in the anterior circulation and an unknown time of onset and a DWI/FLAIR mismatch on imaging. Moreover, bridging therapy versus intravenous thrombolysis alone was independently associated with favorable outcome at 3 months.","Mourand, I; Milhaud, D; Arquizan, C; Lobotesis, K; Schaub, R; Machi, P; Ayrignac, X; Eker, O F; Bonafé, A; Costalat, V",AJNR.

Women with opioid use disorder are at 2 to 3 times greater risk for unintended pregnancy than the general population and may face additional barriers to accessing and effectively using contraception compared to women without opioid use disorder, particularly highly effective long-acting reversible contraception. Additionally, women with opioid use disorder tend to use less effective forms of contraception such as condoms alone. Barriers to contraceptive access include patient misconceptions or knowledge gaps regarding reproductive health and family planning, cost, intimate partner violence, fear of criminalization, difficulty accessing care, comorbid health conditions, and health care provider misconceptions or practice limitations. Strategies that may assist women with opioid use disorder in achieving their family planning goals include colocation of family planning services within opioid treatment facilities, optimization of patient care services to minimize the need for costly and/or time consuming follow-up, increasing provider education and awareness of best practices in family planning and opioid use disorder treatment, and providing patient-centered family planning education and counseling. Additional research is needed to identify and develop strategies that empower women who use opioids to effectively access and use their preferred contraceptive method.","Stone, Rebecca H; Griffin, Brooke; Fusco, Rachel A; Vest, Kathy; Tran, Tran; Gross, Savannah",Journal of clinical pharmacology,861,10

Calves were offered 440 g of milk replacer DM for the first 42 d and grain for ad libitum intake throughout the study. Plasma was analyzed weekly for concentrations of glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Escherichia coli isolated from fecal samples collected every 2 weeks were used for determination of antibiotic resistance patterns. Calves receiving SC consumed more grain DM, had increased weight gain prior to weaning, and increased plasma glucose concentrations compared to controls. Days with diarrhea were reduced by feeding live yeast to calves. Antibiotic resistance in fecal E. coli was associated with the age of calves with highest levels of resistance observed in the 3 d calves. While calves receiving SCSB had higher levels of antibiotic resistance than controls, this effect was not associated with any of the other treatments. Improvements in performance of calves with failure of passive transfer were observed when live yeast was added only to the grain.","Galvão, Klibs N; Santos, José E P; Coscioni, Anelis; Villaseñor, Marcos; Sischo, William M; Berge, Anna Catharina B","Reproduction, nutrition, development",861,1

To this end, we create the BioLAMA benchmark, which is comprised of 49K biomedical factual knowledge triples for probing biomedical LMs. We find that biomedical LMs with recently proposed probing methods can achieve up to 18.51% Acc@5 on retrieving biomedical knowledge. Although this seems promising given the task difficulty, our detailed analyses reveal that most predictions are highly correlated with prompt templates without any subjects, hence producing similar results on each relation and hindering their capabilities to be used as domain-specific KBs.

Corticosteroids reduce the time on mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the intensive care unit and potentially also mortality in similar patient populations. However, corticosteroids have undesirable effects, including longer time to viral clearance. Clinical equipoise on the use of corticosteroids for COVID‐19 exists. METHODS: The COVID STEROID trial is an international, randomised, stratified, blinded clinical trial. We will allocate 1000 adult patients with COVID‐19 receiving ≥10 L/min of oxygen or on mechanical ventilation to intravenous hydrocortisone 200 mg daily vs placebo (0.9% saline) for 7 days. The primary outcome is days alive without life support (ie mechanical ventilation, circulatory support, and renal replacement therapy) at day 28. Secondary outcomes are serious adverse reactions at day 14; days alive without life support at day 90; days alive and out of hospital at day 90; all‐cause mortality at day 28, day 90, and 1 year; and health‐related quality of life at 1 year. We will conduct the statistical analyses according to this protocol, including interim analyses for every 250 patients followed for 28 days. The primary outcome will be compared using the Kryger Jensen and Lange test in the intention to treat population and reported as differences in means and medians with 95% confidence intervals.

Deep-learning (DL) techniques allow extremely precise image segmentation; yet, they necessitate huge volumes of manually labeled data to be trained in a supervised manner. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) paradigms tackle this issue by learning a novel category from a small number of annotated instances. We present an innovative semi-supervised few-shot segmentation (FSS) approach for efficient segmentation of 2019-nCov infection (FSS-2019-nCov) from only a few amounts of annotated lung CT scans. The key challenge of this study is to provide accurate segmentation of COVID-19 infection from a limited number of annotated instances. For that purpose, we propose a novel dual-path deep-learning architecture for FSS. Every path contains encoder–decoder (E-D) architecture to extract high-level information while maintaining the channel information of COVID-19 CT slices. The E-D architecture primarily consists of three main modules: a feature encoder module, a context enrichment (CE) module, and a feature decoder module. We utilize the pre-trained ResNet34 as an encoder backbone for feature extraction. The CE module is designated by a newly introduced proposed Smoothed Atrous Convolution (SAC) block and Multi-scale Pyramid Pooling (MPP) block. The conditioner path takes the pairs of CT images and their labels as input and produces a relevant knowledge representation that is transferred to the segmentation path to be used to segment the new images. To enable effective collaboration between both paths, we propose an adaptive recombination and recalibration (RR) module that permits intensive knowledge exchange between paths with a trivial increase in computational complexity. The model is extended to multi-class labeling for various types of lung infections. This contribution overcomes the limitation of the lack of large numbers of COVID-19 CT scans.

We investigated the bactericidal and virucidal efficacy of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) 7.5% scalp and skin cleanser, chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) 4% hand cleanser and the reference hand wash (soft soap) in 15 healthy volunteers following European Standard EN1499 (hygienic hand wash test method for bacteria), which was adapted for virucidal testing. METHODS: Separate test series were performed for bactericidal (Escherichia coli) and virucidal [murine norovirus (MNV)] testing. After pre-washing and artificial contamination of hands with test organisms, volunteers underwent testing with 3 and 5 mL of each product for contact times of 15, 30 and 60 s according to a Latin-square randomization. The number of test organisms released from fingertips into sampling fluids was assessed before and after hand washing and mean log(10) reduction factor (RF) was calculated. RFs (test-reference) were compared using a Wilcoxon–Wilcox multiple comparisons test per EN1499; efficacy was concluded if p ≤ 0.01. RESULTS: PVP-I 7.5% and CHG 4% cleansers both passed EN1499 requirements against E. coli, with statistically significantly greater (p ≤ 0.01) mean log(10) RFs compared with reference soft soap across all tests (PVP-I: 4.09–5.27; CHG: 4.12–5.22; soap: 2.75–3.11). The experimental design using EN1499 was applicable to testing with MNV as discriminatory and reproducible results were generated. Mean log(10) RFs of MNV were statistically significantly greater for PVP-I (1.57–2.57) compared with soft soap (1.24–1.62), while mean log(10) RFs with CHG (0.90–1.34) were lower than for soft soap across all tests. CONCLUSION: PVP-I 7.5% cleanser showed superior efficacy against MNV compared to soft soap and CHG 4% cleanser, while both PVP-I and CHG were superior to soft soap against E. coli. The experimental set-up may be applicable to future testing for antiviral hand washes. FUNDING: Mundipharma Manufacturing Pte Ltd.

This study aimed to compare physical and mental health between people from the United States (U.S.) and China, and to correlate mental health parameters with variables relating to physical symptoms, knowledge about COVID-19, and precautionary health behaviors. To minimize risk of exposure, respondents were electronically invited by existing study respondents or by data sourcing software and surveys were completed via online survey platforms. Information was collected on demographics, physical symptoms, contact history, knowledge about COVID-19, psychologic parameters (i.e. IES-R; DASS-21), and health behaviors. The study included a total of 1445 respondents (584 U.S.; 861 China). Overall, Americans reported more physical symptoms, contact history, and perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19. Americans reported more stress and depressive symptoms, while Chinese reported higher acute-traumatic stress symptoms. Differences were identified regarding face mask use and desires for COVID-19 related health information, with differential mental health implications. Physical symptoms that were possibly COVID-19 related were associated with adverse mental health. Overall, American and Chinese participants reported different mental and physical health parameters, health behaviors, precautionary measures, and knowledge of COVID-19; different risk and protective factors were also identified.
