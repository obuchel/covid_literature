1423,1423,1423,iNR-Drug: Predicting the Interaction of Drugs with Nuclear Receptors in Cellular Networking,9.160052,6.3139277,2014-03-19,"Nuclear receptors (NRs) are closely associated with various major diseases such as cancer, diabetes, inflammatory disease, and osteoporosis. Therefore, NRs have become a frequent target for drug development. During the process of developing drugs against these diseases by targeting NRs, we are often facing a problem: Given a NR and chemical compound, can we identify whether they are really in interaction with each other in a cell? To address this problem, a predictor called “iNR-Drug” was developed. In the predictor, the drug compound concerned was formulated by a 256-D (dimensional) vector derived from its molecular fingerprint, and the NR by a 500-D vector formed by incorporating its sequential evolution information and physicochemical features into the general form of pseudo amino acid composition, and the prediction engine was operated by the SVM (support vector machine) algorithm. Compared with the existing prediction methods in this area, iNR-Drug not only can yield a higher success rate, but is also featured by a user-friendly web-server established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iNR-Drug/, which is particularly useful for most experimental scientists to obtain their desired data in a timely manner. It is anticipated that the iNR-Drug server may become a useful high throughput tool for both basic research and drug development, and that the current approach may be easily extended to study the interactions of drug with other targets as well.","Fan, Yue-Nong; Xiao, Xuan; Min, Jian-Liang; Chou, Kuo-Chen",Int J Mol Sci,294,1
1632,1632,1632,Archaeal DnaG contains a conserved N-terminal RNA-binding domain and enables tailing of rRNA by the exosome,9.026859,6.3533616,2014-11-10,"The archaeal exosome is a phosphorolytic 3′–5′ exoribonuclease complex. In a reverse reaction it synthesizes A-rich RNA tails. Its RNA-binding cap comprises the eukaryotic orthologs Rrp4 and Csl4, and an archaea-specific subunit annotated as DnaG. In Sulfolobus solfataricus DnaG and Rrp4 but not Csl4 show preference for poly(rA). Archaeal DnaG contains N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) of unknown function flanking a TOPRIM domain. We found that the NT and TOPRIM domains have comparable, high conservation in all archaea, while the CTD conservation correlates with the presence of exosome. We show that the NTD is a novel RNA-binding domain with poly(rA)-preference cooperating with the TOPRIM domain in binding of RNA. Consistently, a fusion protein containing full-length Csl4 and NTD of DnaG led to enhanced degradation of A-rich RNA by the exosome. We also found that DnaG strongly binds native and in vitro transcribed rRNA and enables its polynucleotidylation by the exosome. Furthermore, rRNA-derived transcripts with heteropolymeric tails were degraded faster by the exosome than their non-tailed variants. Based on our data, we propose that archaeal DnaG is an RNA-binding protein, which, in the context of the exosome, is involved in targeting of stable RNA for degradation.","Hou, Linlin; Klug, Gabriele; Evguenieva-Hackenberg, Elena",Nucleic Acids Res,294,1

The factors responsible for specific RNA recognition are not well understood, in part because viral RNA synthesis takes place within enzyme complexes associated with modified cellular membrane compartments. Recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) from the human norovirus and the murine norovirus (MNV) were found to preferentially recognize RNA segments that contain the promoter and a short template sequence for subgenomic RNA synthesis. Both the promoter and template sequence contribute to stable RdRp binding, accurate initiation of the subgenomic RNAs and efficient RNA synthesis. Using a method that combines RNA crosslinking and mass spectrometry, residues near the template channel of the MNV RdRp were found to contact the hairpin RNA motif. Mutations in the hairpin contact site in the MNV RdRp reduced MNV replication and virus production in cells. This work demonstrates that the specific recognition of the norovirus subgenomic promoter is through binding by the viral RdRp.","Lin, Xiaoyan; Thorne, Lucy; Jin, Zhinan; Hammad, Loubna A.; Li, Serena; Deval, Jerome; Goodfellow, Ian G.; Kao, C.

1749,1749,1749,Impact of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea on Performance of Growing Pigs,9.121779,6.5849285,2015-03-13,"The impact of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) infection on the US pork industry has mainly been attributed to the mortality that it causes in suckling piglets, and, consequently, much effort has been invested in the quantification of its effect in sow farms. However, no information on the performance of surviving pigs that were exposed to the PEDv as piglets is available. Here, a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) infection on growing pigs’ performance, as indicated by mortality, average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) was performed using production records from weaned pigs in nursery and wean-to-finish sites from sow farms that became PEDv-infected between May 2013 and June 2014. Production records from the first batch of growing pigs weaned in infected flows after the PEDv outbreak (“infected batches”) were compared with those from pigs weaned within the previous 14 to 120 days (“control batches”). Performance records from infected and control batches, paired by flow, were compared using non-parametric paired tests. Mortality, ADG and FCR were significantly different in PEDv-positive (infected) compared with PEDv-negative (control) batches, with a mean increase of mortality and FCR of 11% and 0.5, respectively, and a decrease of ADG of 0.16 lb/day. Our results demonstrate a poorer performance of growing pigs weaned after a PEDv outbreak compared with those weaned within the previous 14-120 days, suggesting that in addition to the mortality induced by PEDv in suckling pigs, the disease also impairs the performance of surviving pig. These findings help to quantify the impact of PEDv infection in the US and, ultimately, contribute to efforts to quantify the cost-effectiveness of disease prevention and control measures.","Alvarez, Julio; Sarradell, Javier; Morrison, Robert; Perez, Andres",PLoS One,294,1
3054,3054,3054,Differences in the intestinal microbiota between uninfected piglets and piglets infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus,8.845207,6.4745674,2018-02-15,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea, a disastrous gastrointestinal disease, causes great financial losses due to its high infectivity, morbidity and mortality in suckling piglets despite the development and application of various vaccines. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to explore differences in the intestinal microbiota between uninfected piglets and piglets infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The results revealed that the small intestinal microbiota of suckling piglets infected with PEDV showed low diversity and was dominated by Proteobacteria (49.1%). Additionally, the composition of the small intestinal microbiota of sucking piglets infected with PEDV showed marked differences from that of the uninfected piglets. Some of the taxa showing differences in abundance between uninfected piglets and piglets infected with PEDV were associated with cellular transport and catabolism, energy metabolism, the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, and amino acid metabolism as determined through the prediction of microbial function based on the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Therefore, adjusting the intestinal microbiota might be a promising method for the prevention or treatment of PEDV.","Huang, Mei-Zhou; Wang, Sheng-Yi; Wang, Hui; Cui, Dong-An; Yang, Ya-Jun; Liu, Xi-Wang; Kong, Xiao-Jun; Li, Jian-Yong",PLoS One,294,28
3127,3127,3127,Time-series analysis for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome in the United States,8.696692,6.261522,2018-04-03,"Industry-driven voluntary disease control programs for swine diseases emerged in North America in the early 2000’s, and, since then, those programs have been used for monitoring diseases of economic importance to swine producers. One example of such initiatives is Dr. Morrison’s Swine Health Monitoring Project, a nation-wide monitoring program for swine diseases including the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). PRRS has been extensively reported as a seasonal disease in the U.S., with predictable peaks that start in fall and are extended through the winter season. However, formal time series analysis stratified by geographic region has never been conducted for this important disease across the U.S. The main objective of this study was to use approximately seven years of PRRS incidence data in breeding swine herds to conduct time-series analysis in order to describe the temporal patterns of PRRS outbreaks at the farm level for five major swine-producing states across the U.S. including the states of Minnesota, Iowa, North Carolina, Nebraska and Illinois. Data was aggregated retrospectively at the week level for the number of herds containing animals actively shedding PRRS virus. Basic descriptive statistics were conducted followed by autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling, conducted separately for each of the above-mentioned states. Results showed that there was a difference in the nature of PRRS seasonality among states. Of note, when comparing states, the typical seasonal pattern previously described for PRRS could only be detected for farms located in the states of Minnesota, North Carolina and Nebraska. For the other two states, seasonal peaks every six months were detected within a year. In conclusion, we showed that epidemic patterns are not homogeneous across the U.S, with major peaks of disease occurring through the year. These findings highlight the importance of coordinating alternative control strategies in different regions considering the prevailing epidemiological patterns.","Arruda, Andréia Gonçalves; Vilalta, Carles; Puig, Pere; Perez, Andres; Alba, Anna",PLoS One,294,9
3331,3331,3331,Oral administration of inactivated porcine epidemic diarrhea virus activate DCs in porcine Peyer’s patches,8.963153,6.6234665,2018-08-16,"BACKGROUND: Peyer’s patches (PPs) can be considered as the immune site of the intestine. Within PPs, Dendritic cells (DCs) can uptake antigens from the gut lumen by extending dendrites into epithelium, and process it and then present to lymphocytes, which effectively antigen produces an immune response. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), an acute and highly contagious enteric viral disease. The interaction between inactivated porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) has been reported. However, little is known about the interaction between inactivated PEDV and DCs in porcine PPs. RESULTS: In this study, for the first time we investigated the role of DCs in porcine PPs after oral administration inactivated PEDV. Firstly, a method to isolate DCs from porcine PPs was established, in which the purity of SWC3a(+)/MHC-II(+) DCs was more than 90%. Our findings clearly indicate that DCs in porcine PPs after oral administration of inactivated PEDV not only stimulated the proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes, but also secreted cytokines (IL-1, IL-4). Furthermore, the number of DCs and IgA(+) cells in porcine intestinal mucosal significantly increased and the levels of anti-PEDV specific IgG antibody in the serum and SIgA antibody in the feces increased after oral administration inactivated PEDV. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that oral administration of inactivated PEDV activate DCs in porcine Peyer’s patches and inactivated PEDV may be a useful and safe vaccine to trigger adaptive immunity.","Yuan, Chen; Zhang, En; Huang, Lulu; Wang, Jialu; Yang, Qian",BMC Vet Res,294,28
3382,3382,3382,Novel protein chip for the detection of antibodies against infectious bronchitis virus,9.050563,6.645697,2018-09-17,"BACKGROUND: Infectious bronchitis (IB) caused by the IB virus (IBV) can cause acute damage to chickens around the world. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and immune status determination are critical for controlling IBV outbreaks. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have been widely used in the detection of IBV antibodies in the early infection and continuous infection of IB because they are more sensitive and quicker than other diagnostic methods. RESULTS: We have developed two indirect microarray methods to detect antibodies against IBV: a chemiluminescent immunoassay test (CIT) and a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). IBV nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) was expressed, purified from Escherichia coli, and used to spot the initiator integrated poly(dimethylsiloxane), which can provide a near “zero” background for serological assays. Compared with the IDEXX IBV Ab Test kit, CIT and RDT have a sensitivity and specificity of at least 98.88% and 91.67%, respectively. No cross-reaction was detected with antibodies against avian influenza virus subtypes (H5, H7, and H9), Newcastle disease virus, Marek’s disease virus, infectious bursal disease virus, and chicken anemia virus. The coefficients of variation of the reproducibility of the intra- and inter-assays for CIT ranged from 0.8 to 18.63%. The reproducibility of RDT was consistent with the original results. The application of the IBV nsp5 protein microarray showed that the positive rate of the CIT was 96.77%, that of the nsp5 ELISA was 91.40%, and that of the RDT was 90.32%. Furthermore, the RDT, which was visible to the naked eye, could be completed within 15 min. Our results indicated that compared with nsp5 ELISA, the CIT was more sensitive, and the RDT had similar positive rates but was faster. Furthermore, the two proposed methods were specific and stable. CONCLUSIONS: Two microarray assays, which were rapid, specific, sensitive, and relatively simple, were developed for the detection of an antibody against IBV. These methods can be of great value for the surveillance of pathogens and monitoring the efficiency of vaccination.","Yan, Liping; Hu, Jianhua; Lei, Jing; Shi, Zhiyu; Xiao, Qian; Bi, Zhenwei; Yao, Lu; Li, Yuan; Chen, Yuqing; Fang, An; Li, Hui; Song, Suquan; Liao, Min; Zhou, Jiyong",BMC Vet Res,294,28

Blood samples were centrifuged to obtain sera. Serial serum dilutions were subjected to serological examination for PEDV presence using Neutralization test (NT). The cut-off titer was set at titer of 1:2 dilution and farms with at least one positive sample in duplicate were classified as PED-positive farms. Several non-case farms (9.4%, 6/64) and 100% (16/16) of the case farms were indeed positive for PEDV. The proportion of seropositive animals from case farms was 63.7%, significantly different from that of non-case farms (4.3%, P<0.05).

3664,3664,3664,Key Gaps in the Knowledge of the Porcine Respiratory Reproductive Syndrome Virus (PRRSV),8.856599,6.3122873,2019-02-20,"The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most important swine diseases in the world. It is causing an enormous economic burden due to reproductive failure in sows and a complex respiratory syndrome in pigs of all ages, with mortality varying from 2 to 100% in the most extreme cases of emergent highly pathogenic strains. PRRSV displays complex interactions with the immune system and a high mutation rate, making the development, and implementation of control strategies a major challenge. In this review, the biology of the virus will be addressed focusing on newly discovered functions of non-structural proteins and novel dissemination mechanisms. Secondly, the role of different cell types and viral proteins will be reviewed in natural and vaccine-induced immune response together with the role of different immune evasion mechanisms focusing on those gaps of knowledge that are critical to generate more efficacious vaccines. Finally, novel strategies for antigen discovery and vaccine development will be discussed, in particular the use of exosomes (extracellular vesicles of endocytic origin). As nanocarriers of lipids, proteins and nucleic acids, exosomes have potential effects on cell activation, modulation of immune responses and antigen presentation.

In order to manage and maintain stable productivity, it is important to establish policies for biosecurity. Infectious respiratory diseases are a major threat to poultry farming. Avian influenza and Newcastle disease have been reported in Myanmar, but no scientific information is available for other respiratory pathogens, such as mycoplasmas and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Identifying the genotypes and serotypes of IBVs is especially important to inform vaccination programs. In this study, we detected Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), M. synoviae (MS), and IBV in several poultry farms in Myanmar. RESULTS: Samples were collected from 20 farms in three major poultry farming areas in Myanmar, and MG, MS, and IBV were detected on two, four, and eight farms, respectively, by polymerase chain reaction. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the observed MG and MS isolates were not identical to vaccine strains. Three different genotypes of IBV were detected, but none was an unknown variant. CONCLUSIONS: Mycoplasmas and IBV were detected on poultry farms in Myanmar.

4070,4070,4070,Dietary 25-Hydroxyvitamin D(3) Supplementation Alleviates Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Infection by Improving Intestinal Structure and Immune Response in Weaned Pigs,8.968257,6.7480845,2019-08-29,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Porcine epidemic diarrhea is one of the major problems in current swine husbandry worldwide, and effective measures for prevention and treatment are scarce. We found that high dose 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) supplementation could ease intestinal injury and inhibit intestinal immune response induced by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), suggesting that feeding a high dose of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) could be used as an approach against PEDV infection. ABSTRACT: We conducted this experiment to determine if feeding 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (25(OH)D(3)) to weaned pigs would alleviate porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection and immune response. Forty-two weaned pigs were allotted to 1 of 6 dietary 25(OH)D(3) treatments (5.5, 5.5, 43.0, 80.5, 118.0, 155.5 μg 25(OH)D(3)/kg diet) for 26 days. On day 22 of the trial, all the treatments were orally administrated with PEDV except for one of the 5.5 μg 25(OH)D(3)/kg treatments, which was challenged with the same volume of sterile saline and served as control. Another 5.5 μg 25(OH)D(3)/kg group for PEDV challenge was named CON-PEDV. Average daily gain (p < 0.05) was reduced by PEDV infection. PEDV administration also induced severe diarrhea (p < 0.05), reduction of villous height and the ratio of villous height to crypt depth, and increase of crypt depth and serum diamine oxidase activity (p < 0.05). Serum IgM and complement component 4 levels were increased by PEDV challenge. However, 155.5 μg 25(OH)D(3)/kg supplementation alleviated intestinal damage (p < 0.05) compared with CON-PEDV. Furthermore, 155.5 μg 25(OH)D(3)/kg supplementation downregulated the mRNA abundance of inflammatory cytokines and interferon signal pathway-related genes (p < 0.05) compared with CON-PEDV. These results suggested that dietary supplementation of 155.5 μg 25(OH)D(3)/kg could alleviate intestinal damage and protect against PEDV-induced inflammatory status.","Yang, Jiwen; Tian, Gang; Chen, Daiwen; Zheng, Ping; Yu, Jie; Mao, Xiangbing; He, Jun; Luo, Yuheng; Luo, Junqiu; Huang, Zhiqing; Wu, Aimin; Yu, Bing",Animals (Basel),294,28

The large economic impact of PED on the swine industry worldwide has made the development of an effective PED vaccine a necessity. S0, a truncated region of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) spike protein, has been suggested as a candidate antigen for PED subunit vaccines; however, poor solubility problems when the protein is expressed in Escherichia coli, and the inherent problems of subunit vaccines, such as low immunogenicity, remain. Flagellin has been widely used as a fusion partner to enhance the immunogenicity and solubility of many difficult-to-express proteins; however, the conjugation effect of flagellin varies depending on the target antigen or the position of the fusion placement. Here, we conjugated flagellin, Vibrio vulnificus FlaB, to the N- and C-termini of S0 and evaluated the ability of the fusion to enhance the solubility and immunogenicity of S0. Flagellin conjugation in the presence of the trigger factor chaperone tig greatly improved the solubility of the fusion protein (up to 99%) regardless of its conjugation position. Of importance, flagellin conjugated to the N-terminus of S0 significantly enhanced S0-specific humoral immune responses compared to other recombinant antigens in Balb/c mice. The mechanism of this phenomenon was investigated through in vitro and in vivo studies. These findings provide important information for the development of a novel PED vaccine and flagellin-based immunotherapeutics.","Oh, Seo-ho; Kim Cho, Young-Saeng; Lee, Ho-Bin; Lee, Sang-Mok; Kim, Whee-Soo; Hong, Liang; Cho, Chong-Su; Choi, Yun-Jaie; Kang, Sang-Kee",J Vet Sci,294,28

However, total virus yield was low and infectious centers assays revealed that a minority (6%) of monocytes become productively infected. Viral yield from monocytes was lower than from the heterogeneous mononuclear cells; however, when uninfected lymphocytes were added back to infected monocytes, the higher viral yield was restored. The purity of the cells did not significantly affect the number of cells infected. These results suggest that more poliovirus is produced per cell from activated rather than unactivated monocytes.

In total, 3,706 proteins within false discovery rate of 1% were identified, including 119 significantly differentially expressed proteins. Functional analysis revealed that proteins related to immune response and muscle contraction were significantly enriched. With respect to the immune response, up-regulated proteins (like FGA) were pro-inflammatory, while down-regulated proteins participated in antigen processing and antigen presenting (like MYO1G), immunoglobulin and cathelicidin production (like fowlicidin-2), and immunodeficiency (like PTPRC). Regarding muscle contraction, all differentially expressed proteins (like TPM1) were up-regulated. An over-expression of mucin, which is a common feature of airway disease, was also observed. Additionally, the transcriptional alterations of 6 selected proteins were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Overall, proteomic changes suggested the onset of airway obstruction and diminished host defense in trachea after ammonia exposure.

In contrast, there was no change in the apparent affinity of the transport system forl-[(14)C]ascorbate. The increase inV (max) was reversed by addition ofl-ascorbate, but notD-isoascorbate, to the medium. The effects of external ascorbate on ascorbate transport activity were specific in that preincubation of cultures withl-ascorbate did not affect uptake of 2-deoxy-D-[(3)H(G)]glucose. We conclude that the astroglial ascorbate transport system is modulated by changes in substrate availability. Regulation of transport activity may play a role in intracellular ascorbate homeostasis by compensating for regional differences and temporal fluctuations in external ascorbate levels.","Wilson, John X.; Jaworski, Ewa M.; Kulaga, Andrew; Jeffrey Dixon, S.",Neurochem Res,294,28

The wasting of musculature and loss of nearly all adipose tissue suggested that even though the PEMS-infected poults were eating some feed, nutrient intake was not sufficient to meet body requirements for maintenance and growth. Because epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract appeared to be a target of the undefined etiological agent (or agents) that causes PEMS, a study was conducted in which PEMS-infected poults were evaluated for malabsorption through 3 wk of age. D-Xylose, a poorly metabolized pentose, was given per os as a bolus, and blood samples were obtained from the ulnar vein in the wing of control and PEMS-infected poults over a 3-h period to estimate intestinal absorption. D-Xylose absorption in control poults peaked 30 to 60 min after the oral treatment, similar to results reported earlier. The PEMS-infected poults did not show a peak in absorption. The PEMS-infected poults showed significant delays in D-xylose absorption at 4, 7, and 11 d after PEMS challenge. The severe malabsorption and metabolic deficiency problem associated with PEMS was postulated to be a direct effect of the undefined infectious agent or agents that cause the disease.","Doerfler, R.E.; Cain, L.D.; Edens, F.W.; Parkhurst, C.R.; Qureshi, M.A.; Havenstein, G.B.",Poult Sci,294,28

In this study, we investigate the capability of NDL-PCBs 101, 153, and 180, 3 of the 6 NDL-PCBs defined as indicators, to impair the immune response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated J774A.1 and primary murine macrophages. Our results clearly demonstrate that the exposure of J774A.1 and primary macrophages to NDL-PCB 153 or 180 or all NDL-PCBs mixtures causes a significant reduction in LPS-induced cytokine/chemokine synthesis, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6, together with monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, involved in cell recruitment. Moreover, PCBs were found to suppress LPS-stimulated NO production, and to reduce cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in J774A.1 and primary macrophages. At mechanistic level, PCBs significantly counteract the LPS-driven toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and CD14 upregulation, therefore inhibiting downstream nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in J774A.1. Furthermore, PCBs determine a significant loss of macrophage endocytic capacity, a prerequisite for efficient antigen presentation. Taken together, these data indicate that NDL-PCBs reduce macrophage responsiveness, particularly when they are combined at concentrations per se inactive, impairing the capability to orchestrate a proper immune response to an infectious stimulus, disrupting TLR4/NF-κB pathway.","Santoro, Anna; Ferrante, Maria C.; Di Guida, Francesca; Pirozzi, Claudio; Lama, Adriano; Simeoli, Raffaele; Clausi, Maria T.; Monnolo, Anna; Mollica, Maria Pina; Mattace Raso, Giuseppina; Meli, Rosaria",Toxicol Sci,294,28

Binding of the low cell culture passaged Miller-6 strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) to villous enterocytes from newborn piglets was at a high level, similar to that observed to culturedswine test is (ST) cells. Binding of the virus to cryptal enterocytes from newborn piglets or to villous or cryptal enterocytes from weaned piglets was significantly lower. In a competitive virus binding assay with radiolabelled virus, the binding of TGEV to ST cells was found to be saturable, while binding to MDBK cells, in which the virus fails to replicate, was at a lower level and was non-saturable. In the same assay, virus binding to the villous enterocytes from the jejunum of a newborn piglet was saturable, while binding to cryptal enterocytes from a newborn piglet, and to villous and cryptal enterocytes from a weaned piglet, was non-saturable. It was concluded that the high susceptibility of newborn piglets to TGEV infection, and the tropism of the virus for villous enterocytes, may relate to the presence of specific, saturable binding sites on the plasma membrane of villous enterocytes.","Weingartl, H.M.; Derbyshire, J.B.",Vet Microbiol,294,28

The donor piglets developed clinical signs of transmissible gastroenteritis which persisted for up to 3 days, and they developed peak serum titres of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies 2 weeks post-infection. The leukocytes were cultured in the presence of pokeweed mitogen (PWM), various dilutions of purified TGEV, or control media for 3 or 5 days, and the culture supernatants were tested for antiviral activity in MDBK cells challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus. The antiviral activity was characterized as porcine interferon (IFN)-α or porcine IFN-τ on the basis of its stability at pH 2.0 and neutralization by anti-human IFN-α antibodies. Viability of the leukocytes in culture, determined by trypan blue exclusion, was highest for the peripheral blood leukocytes and lowest for the mesenteric lymph node leukocytes. There were no consistent differences in antiviral activity between cultures incubated for 3 or 5 days. Porcine IFN-α was found in the supernatants of the leukocyte cultures stimulated with TGEV antigen, harvested before or after infection of the donor piglets with TGEV. Porcine IFN-τ was demonstrated in the supernatants of the leukocyte cultures stimulated with PWM, more frequently when the leukocytes were harvested post-infection.

To identify other antigens with serodiagnostic potential, immunoblot studies following sodium dodecyl sulphate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were carried out. Sera from pigs experimentally infected with Brucella suis and naturally infected feral pigs, sera from pigs from a farm with a known history of Yersinia enterocolitica 0:9 infection, Brucella Complement Fixation Test (CFT) reactor pigs (aetiology unknown) and pigs from consistently Brucella CFT negative farms were examined. Although B. suis infected pigs recognized a total of nine B. melitensis antigens, individual pigs rarely recognized more than three antigens in the range. A 62 kDa antigen was recognized by the majority (73%) of the Brucella infected pigs, but only by 10 to 23% of pigs from the other groups. This antigen was shown to be the Brucella homologue of the ubiquitous 65 kDa heat shock protein (HSP-65) family by immunoblot studies with 14 monoclonal antibodies to the Mycobacterium leprae HSP-65. Only four of these monoclones (Y1.2, ML-30, D7C and IIIC8) identified the B. melitensis 62 kDa protein suggesting that unshared, potentially Brucella specific, regions exist. Sera from Y. enterocolitica 0:9 infected pigs, CFT reactor pigs (aetiology unknown), CFT negative pigs and hyperimmune pig serum raised to Y. enterocolitica 0:9 also recognized B. melitensis antigens, most notably a 17 kDa protein.

Calves were orally inoculated at 6 days old with either rotavirus (5), ETEC (7), rotavirus and ETEC (5) or remained uninoculated controls (4), and their reactions were recorded by clinical, microbiological, and pathological observations. Rotavirus infection consistently produced diarrhoea, while ETEC inoculated alone did not colonise the intestine. In dual infections, both rotavirus and ETEC multiplied, although the severity of diarrhoea was not greater than that caused by rotavirus alone. Some ETEC-inoculated calves developed subsequent naturally-acquired rotavirus infections, but in these no ETEC multiplication occurred. The results suggest that prior or simultaneous rotavirus infection is necessary to enable ETEC colonisation of the intestine in convenstional calves of this age.","Snodgrass, D.R.; Smith, Megan L.; Krautil, Fiona L.",Vet Microbiol,294,28

The piglets were either nursed by the sow, artificially reared after sucking colostrum, or weaned on to creep feed. Colostrum-fed, artificially reared piglets obtained from two litters and exposed in the first week of life developed clinical signs of inappetence, vomiting and diarrhoea and shed oocysts in the faeces. Histologically the parasite was observed throughout the small and large intestine attached to epithelial cell surfaces and its presence was associated with extensive mucosal damage, particularly in the posterior small intestine, stunting and fusion of villi, immaturity of villous epithelial cells and oedema with increased cellularity of the lamina propria. Piglets from two other litters, both sucking and colostrum-fed artificially reared, exhibited similar but milder clinical signs. Histological lesions were less severe and Cryptosporidium infection less extensive. When weaned piglets were exposed they remained clinically healthy although histologically there was evidence of Cryptosporidium attachment in the small intestine and minor mucosal damage. There appears to be a good correlation between the extent of intestinal infection, the degree of mucosal damage and the severity of clinical disease induced by Cryptosporidium in piglets.","Tzipori, S.; McCartney, E.; Lawson, G.H.K.; Rowland, A.C.; Campbell, I.",Res Vet Sci,294,28

We followed PRISMA guidelines and searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify relevant articles published between January 2013 and December 2018.

Sporadic human infections have recently been reported, caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses detected in poultry. H7N9 AIVs resistant to adamantine and oseltamivir cause severe human infection by rapidly inducing progressive acute community-acquired pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction, and cytokine dysregulation; however, mechanisms via which the virus induces severe syndromes remain unclear. An H7N9 AIV vaccine is lacking; designs under evaluation include synthesized peptide, baculovirus-insect system, and virus-like particle vaccines.

To evaluate the impact of degradation processes on habitat quality, we investigated how succession from sparse vegetated sand ecosystems to grass‐invaded and tree‐dominated ecosystems and the environmental parameters associated with it influences carabid assemblages. We also determined to what extent typical xerophilic species assemblages still exist. Pitfall trapping at 28 study sites in northwestern Germany yielded 111 carabid species that were grouped using Kendall's W coefficient of concordance. Ordination revealed that the differences between the four species groups resulted from vegetation cover and soil humidity, indicating that carabid distribution clearly reflects degradation processes. Our results suggest that areas in which succession proceeds were unsuitable for assemblages typical of dry grasslands and heathlands. In all, 35 species are lost due to succession from dry grassland and heathland to grass‐invaded and tree‐dominated sites.

Additionally, these cytokines promote the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increased production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-3, in synoviocytes that result in joint destruction. There is limited information on how proteolytic enzymes such as MMP-3 can be regulated. We evaluated the effect of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on RA and identified the relationship between the c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and MMP-3. We hypothesized that elucidating this relationship would lead to novel therapeutic approaches to RA treatment and management. METHODS: We investigated the effect of administering a low dose (1000 μM or less) of an antioxidant (NAC) to human rheumatoid fibroblast-like synoviocytes (MH7A cells). We also investigated the response of antioxidant genes such as nuclear factor erythroid -derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Sequestosome 1 (p62). The influence of MMP-3 expression on the JNK pathway leading to joint destruction and the mechanisms underlying this relationship were investigated through primary dispersion culture cells collected from the synovial membranes of RA patients, consisting of rheumatoid arthritis-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS). RESULTS: Low-dose NAC (1000 μM) increased the expression of Nrf2 and phospho-p62 in MH7A cells, activating antioxidant genes, suppressing the expression of MMP-3, and inhibiting the phosphorylation of JNK. ROS, MMP-3 expression, and IL-6 was suppressed by administering 30 μM of SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) in MH7A cells. Furthermore, the administration of SP600125 (30 μM) to RA-FLS suppressed MMP-3. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the existence of an MMP-3 suppression mechanism that utilizes the JNK pathway in RA-FLS. We consider that the JNK pathway could be a target for future RA therapies.","Kanai, Tomotake; Kondo, Naoki; Okada, Masayasu; Sano, Hiroshige; Okumura, Go; Kijima, Yasufumi; Ogose, Akira; Kawashima, Hiroyuki; Endo, Naoto",J Orthop Surg Res,294,28

The multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and Bayesian analysis of Population Structure (BAPS) analyses were both conducted for phylogeny construction. Serotyping and pilus typing were determined in silico using the genomic sequences. The CPS and pilus typing results were generally consistent with MLST and BAPS clustering. GBS isolates of serotype II and of the PI-1 + PI-2b and PI-2a types were more prone to phylogenetic inconsistency than the others. Isolates of serotype Ib and of PI-1 + PI-2a were more likely to appear as colonizing strains, whereas PI-2b was more likely to appear in invasive strains.

METHODS: Screening of over 500 malaria cases admitted to the hospitals in 11 districts hospital within Aceh Province during 2013–2015, identified 90 cases of P. falciparum mono-infection without any co-morbidity. The subjects were clinically phenotyped and parasite DNA was extracted and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified for the msp1 and msp2 allelic subfamilies. RESULTS: Analysis of clinical manifestation revealed that fever-chill is the most frequent symptom. Based on WHO criteria showed 19 cases were classified as severe and 71 as mild malaria.

Has it offset agglomeration benefits and led to more dispersed spatial structures, or has it strengthened urban externalities and thus resulted in more concentrated spatial structures? Theoretical and empirical studies on this question have produced contradictory findings. The present study recognizes that assumptions made earlier about the evolution of technological capabilities do not necessarily hold today. As cutting-edge digital technologies have matured considerably, a fresh look at this question is called for. The paper addresses this issue by means of several data sets using instrumental variable methods. One is the UN data on Urban Settlements with more than 300, 000 inhabitants. Estimation methods with these data show that increased adoption of ICT has resulted in national urban systems that are less uniform in terms of city sizes and are characterized by higher population concentrations in larger cities, when concentration is proxied the Pareto (Zipf) coefficient for national city size distributions. Two, is disaggregated data for the urban systems of the US, defined as Micropolitan and Metropolitan Areas, and for the UK, defined as Built-up Areas in England and Wales, respectively.

Many factors involved in the neuropathology of AD in DS, including epigenetic factors, innate immunity and impaired haematopoiesis, contribute significantly towards the pathophysiology and the enhanced ageing processes seen in DS and as a consequence of the triplication of genes RUNX1, S100β and OLIG2, together with the influence of proteins that collectively protect from cellular defects and inflammation, which include hepcidin, ferritin, IL-6 and TREM2. This study is aimed at determining whether genetic variants and inflammatory proteins are involved in haematopoiesis and cellular processes in DS compared with age-matched control participants, particularly with respect to neuroinflammation and accelerated ageing. Serum protein levels from DS, AD and control participants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Blood smears and post-mortem brain samples from AD and DS subjects were analysed by immunohistochemistry. RUNX1 mRNA expression was analysed by RT-PCR and in situ hybridisation in mouse tissues. Our results suggest that hepcidin, S100β and TREM2 play a critical role in survival and proliferation of glial cells through a common shared pathway. Blood smear analysis showed the presence of RUNX1 in megakaryocytes and platelets, implying participation in myeloid cell development. In contrast, hepcidin was expressed in erythrocytes and in platelets, suggesting a means of possible entry into the brain parenchyma via the choroid plexus (CP). The gene product of RUNX1 and hepcidin both play a critical role in haematopoiesis in DS. We propose that soluble TREM2, S100β and hepcidin can migrate from the periphery via the CP, modulate the blood–brain immune axis in DS and could form an important and hitherto neglected avenue for possible therapeutic interventions to reduce plaque formation.","Raha-Chowdhury, Ruma; Raha, Animesh Alexander; Henderson, James; Ghaffari, Seyedeh Deniz; Grigorova, Monika; Beresford-Webb, Jessica; Allinson, Kieren; Chakraborty, Subhojit; Holland, Anthony; Zaman, Shahid H.",J Clin Med,294,1

We have previously reported that congenital asplenia in zebrafish reduces resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila infection. However, the molecular mechanism of systemic immune response in congenitally asplenic individuals is largely unexplored. In this study, we found that pro-inflammatory cytokines were more highly induced in congenitally asplenic zebrafish than wild-type after pathogenic A. hydrophila infection and lipopolysaccharide exposure. In addition, a higher aggregation of apoptotic cells was observed in congenitally asplenic zebrafish than that in wild-type. Next, we examined the transcriptome profiles of whole kidneys from wild-type and congenitally asplenic zebrafish to investigate the effects of congenital asplenia on innate and adaptive immune responses induced by the inactivated A. hydrophila. Congenital asplenia inactivated the splenic anti-inflammatory reflex, disrupted immune homeostasis, and induced excessive inflammation as evidenced by the highly induced stress response–related biological processes, inflammatory and apoptosis-associated pathways, and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in congenitally asplenic zebrafish compared with wild-type after vaccination. In addition, complement component genes (c3a.1, c3a.6, c4, c6, and c9) and several important immune-related genes (tabp.1, tap1, hamp, prg4b, nfil3, defbl1, psmb9a, tfr1a, and sae1) were downregulated in congenitally asplenic zebrafish. Furthermore, congenital asplenia impaired adaptive immunity as demonstrated by downregulation of biological processes and signaling pathways involved in adaptive immune response after vaccination in congenitally asplenic zebrafish. The expression of MHCII/IgM was also significantly reduced in the congenitally asplenic zebrafish when compared with wild-type. Together, our study provides an in-depth understanding of spleen function in controlling immune homeostasis and may offer insight into the pathological response in splenectomized or congenitally asplenic patients after infections.","Xie, Lang; Chen, Zheyu; Guo, Hui; Tao, Yixi; Miao, Xiaomin; Wu, Ronghua; Li, Yun",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,294,28

Twelve states without expanded Medicaid caused two million people who were under the poverty line into health insecurity. Principal Component-based logistical regression (PCA-LA) is used to consider health status (HS) as a dependent variable and fourteen social-economic indexes as independent variables. Four composite components incorporated health conditions (i.e., “no regular source of care” (NRC), “last check-up more than a year ago” (LCT)), demographic impacts (i.e., four categorized adults (AS)), education (ED), and marital status (MS). Compared to the unadjusted LA, direct adjusted LA, and PCA-unadjusted LA three methods, the PCA-LA approach exhibited objective and reasonable outcomes in presenting an odd ratio (OR). They included that health condition is positively significant to HS due to beyond one OR, and negatively significant to ED, AS, and MS. This paper provided quantitative evidence for the Medicaid gap in Texas to extend Medicaid, exposed healthcare geographical inequity, offered a sight for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to improve the Medicaid program and make political justice for the Medicaid gap.","Zhang, Jinting; Wu, Xiu",Healthcare (Basel),294,28

In vitro studies show that immunotherapy could be an effective strategy. However, these studies include strategies to enrich HBV-specific CD8 T cells, which could alter the expression of the anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibody targets. Our aim was to determine the efficacy of PD-L1 blockade ex vivo. METHODS: HBV-specific CD8 T cells were characterized ex vivo by flow cytometry for the simultaneous analysis of six immune populations and 14 activating and inhibitory receptors. Ex vivo functionality was quantified by ELISpot and by combining peptide pool stimulation, dextramers and intracellular flow cytometry staining. RESULTS: The functionality of HBV-specific CD8 T cells is associated with a higher frequency of cells with low exhaustion phenotype (LAG3(-)TIM3(-)PD-1(+)), independently of the clinical parameters. The accumulation of HBV-specific CD8 T cells with a functionally exhausted phenotype (LAG3(+)TIM3(+)PD-1(+)) is associated with lack of ex vivo functionality. PD-L1 blockade enhanced the HBV-specific CD8 T cell response only in patients with lower exhaustion levels, while response to PD-L1 blockade was abrogated in patients with higher frequencies of exhausted HBV-specific CD8 T cells. CONCLUSION: Higher levels of functionally exhausted HBV-specific CD8 T cells are associated with a lack of response that cannot be restored by blocking the PD-1:PD-L1 axis. This suggests that the clinical effectiveness of blocking the PD-1:PD-L1 axis as a monotherapy may be restricted. Combination strategies, potentially including the combination of anti-LAG-3 with other anti-iR antibodies, will likely be required to elicit a functional cure for patients with high levels of functionally exhausted HBV-specific CD8 T cells.","Ferrando-Martinez, Sara; Snell Bennett, Angie; Lino, Elisabete; Gehring, Adam J.; Feld, Jordan; Janssen, Harry L.

Families consider safety and cost along with the comfort and familiarity of birthing venues. A substantial literature addresses safety concerns, generally reporting that for low-risk mothers in the care of credentialed midwives, the safety of planned home births is comparable to that in birth centers and hospitals. The lack of notable safety tradeoffs for low-risk mothers elevates the relevance of the economic efficiency of home births. The available cost figures for home births are largely out of date or anecdotal. The purpose of this research is to offer scholars, policymakers, and families improved estimates of both the cost of home births and the potential savings from greater access to home births. On the basis of a nationwide study, we estimate that the average cost of a home birth in the United States is USD 4650, which is significantly below existing cost estimates for an uncomplicated birth center or hospital birth. Further, we find that each shift of one percent of births from hospitals to homes would represent an annual cost savings to society of at least USD 321 million.","Anderson, David A.; Gilkison, Gabrielle M.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,294,33

Tissue inflammation is partly orchestrated by macrophage responses to bacterial infection. Studies in monogastric species showed classical phenotype macrophages have proinflammatory responses and alternative phenotype macrophages have protective and restorative responses during disease. However, responses of diverse bovine macrophage phenotypes to lipopolysaccharide are unclear. The objective of this research was to compare the lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response in several phenotypes of bovine primary monocyte-derived macrophages. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood using Ficoll (n = 8 cows). Monocytes were identified using mouse anti-bovine CD172α monoclonal antibody and separated from lymphocytes using magnetic assisted cell sorting. Monocytes were cultured with interferon-γ or interleukins (IL) 4 and 13 to induce a classical or alternative macrophage phenotype, respectively, then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Macrophage mRNA was quantified in adipose using qPCR. Fold changes in mRNA concentration were calculated by 2(-ΔΔCt), using the untreated cells as calibrator and three endogenous control mRNA. Treatment differences in mRNA expression were identified using Fisher pairwise comparisons and ANOVA (P ≤ 0.05). Flow cytometry showed magnetic assisted cell sorting increased CD172α(+) cells from 22.3 ± 1.9 to 81.6 ± 2.8%. After 48 h in vitro, CD68 expression increased and CD172α(+) was 95.2 ± 0.4%. Lipopolysaccharide increased IL6, IL10, TNF, and CCL2 expression. Lipopolysaccharide stimulated IL6 and IL10 expression was decreased in alternative macrophages, whereas lipopolysaccharide stimulated TNF expression was increased in classical macrophages. Lipopolysaccharide stimulated CCL2 expression was not different between macrophage types. Together these results show an exacerbated proinflammatory cytokine profile in a model of classical bovine macrophages during gram negative bacterial disease. Results suggest that macrophage phenotype could be involved with severe inflammatory responses seen during dairy cow periparturient periods characterized by prolonged and exacerbated lipolysis and increased disease susceptibility. Ongoing research will describe macrophage phenotype during bovine disease and identify factors contributing to phenotype change. Such factors could ultimately be manipulated to control the bovine macrophage inflammatory response.","Raphael, W.; Contreras, G. A.",J Anim Sci,294,28

Of 582 respondents, 258 (45%) were in the US, and 314 (55%) were international. 80.4% were affiliated with academic institutions. 94% respondents reported changes in clinical practice; 95% reported conversion to telemedicine for at least some appointments. However, almost 10% practitioners felt the need to see patients in person specifically because of billing concerns and perceived institutional pressure. Over 50% believed neuro-oncology patients were at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. 67% practitioners suspended enrollment for at least one clinical trial: 53% suspended phase II and 62% suspended phase III trial enrollment. 71% clinicians feared for their or their families’ safety, specifically because of their clinical duties. 20% percent said they did not have enough PPE to work safely; about the same percentage were unhappy with their institutions’ response to the pandemic. 43% believed the pandemic would negatively affect their academic career, and 52% fellowship program directors were worried about losing funding for their training programs. While 69% respondents reported increased stress, 44% were offered no psychosocial support. 37% had their salary reduced. 36% researchers had to temporarily close their laboratories. In contrast, the pandemic created positive changes in perceived patient and family satisfaction, quality of communication, and use of technology to deliver care and interactions with other practitioners. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has altered standard treatment schedules and limited investigational treatment options for patients. In some cases, clinicians felt institutional pressure to continue conducting billable in-person visits when telemedicine visits would have sufficed. A lack of institutional support created anxiety among clinicians and researchers.

One of the key lessons from food processing and related industries is that without being designated as an essential service and targeted stimulus packages, the food industry could have fallen victim to the COVID‐19 crisis. Although the social and economic impacts of the interventions are not clear, being designated as an essential service was likely far more important to the food industry than the targeted stimulus packages. The pandemic and shutdown orders had a considerable production reallocation effect. Some processors have seen temporary closure and reduced capacity utilization. On the upside, disruptions in the food processing sector have not been as severe as in non‐essential sectors. The food processing sector has proven to be relatively stable during the pandemic – food was still processed and delivered to consumers and food price increases were minimal in most cases given the scale of the shock. Moving forward, because COVID‐19 is a global crisis, internationally targeted and coordinated efforts to tackle the virus could place the industry on a strong trajectory towards economic recovery and growth. Résumé Dans cet article, j'explore les activités économiques de l'industrie de la transformation des aliments pendant la pandémie COVID‐19. L'une des principales leçons tirées de la transformation des aliments et des industries connexes est que sans être désignée comme un service essentiel et visée par des plans de relance ciblés, l'industrie alimentaire aurait pu être victime de la crise du COVID‐19. Bien que les impacts sociaux et économiques des interventions ne soient pas clairs, être désigné comme un service essentiel était probablement beaucoup plus important pour l'industrie alimentaire que les plans de relance ciblés. La pandémie et les ordres d'arrêt ont eu un effet considérable de réallocation de la production. Certains transformateurs ont connu des fermetures temporaires et une utilisation réduite de leurs capacités. Les perturbations dans le secteur de la transformation des aliments n'ont pas été aussi graves que dans les secteurs non essentiels. Le secteur de la transformation des aliments s'est avéré relativement stable pendant la pandémie ‐ les aliments étaient encore transformés et livrés aux consommateurs et les augmentations des prix des denrées alimentaires ont été minimes dans la plupart des cas compte tenu de l'ampleur du choc. À l'avenir, parce que le COVID‐19 est une crise mondiale, des efforts coordonnés et ciblés au niveau international pour lutter contre le virus pourraient placer l'industrie sur une trajectoire solide vers la reprise économique et la croissance.","Hailu, Getu",,294,1

Over the last several years there have been advances that allowed for less invasive forms of interventions. Objective: Our hypothesis was that over the past decade the rate of procedures performed by Pediatric Critical Care Medicine Fellowship trainees decreased. Methods: Retrospective review at a single institution, tertiary, academic, children's hospital of patients admitted from July 1, 2007-June 30, 2017 to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit. A Poisson regression model with a scale adjustment for over-dispersion estimated by the square root of Pearson's Chi-Square/DOF was applied. Results: There has been a statistically significant decrease in the average rate of central venous lines (p = 0.004; -5.72; 95% CI: -9.45, -1.82) and arterial lines (p = 0.02; -7.8; 95% CI: -13.90, -1.25) per Fellow per years in Fellowship over the last 10 years.

RECENT FINDINGS Since October 2014, the results of five randomized controlled multicenter trials on the endovascular stroke treatment as adjunct to conservative treatment (largely including intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator) versus conservative treatment alone have been published. All of these trials largely used stent retrievers as endovascular device and included patients with proven large vessel occlusion (mostly distal internal carotid or proximal middle cerebral artery (M1), short time windows after stroke onset and mostly small infarctions on initial imaging. Over all there was an overwhelming beneficial effect on outcome measured as shift in the modified Rankin Scale score and independent survival, respectively. Moreover, the rate of adverse events, in particular hemorrhage rate, was not increased. These new findings contrast previous studies on endovascular stroke treatment using mostly first generation nonstent retriever devices, longer time windows and different imaging inclusion criteria, which were overall neutral for patient outcome. SUMMARY Endovascular stroke treatment with stent retrievers is the standard of care in large vessel occlusion. New randomized controlled trials should investigate safety and efficacy in extended indications as advanced time windows or more extensive signs of ischemia on initial imaging. The same applies for new devices apart from stent retrievers.","Bendszus, Martin; Hacke, Werner",Current opinion in neurology,294,1

RESULTS Forty veterans (mean (standard deviation (SD)) age = 72.4 (6.1) years; 100% male; 37.5% Black) and their care partners (mean (SD) age = 64.7 (10.8) years) were enrolled and randomized to telephone or video-enhanced care management. About a third of veteran participants indicated familiarity with relevant technology (regular tablet use and/or experience with videoconferencing); 53.6% of internet users were comfortable or very comfortable using the internet. Overall, 43 (71.7%) care management calls were completed in the video arm and 52 (86.7%) were completed in the telephone arm. Usability of the video telehealth platform was rated higher for participants already familiar with technology used to deliver the intervention (mean (SD) System Usability Scale scores: 65.0 (17.0) vs 55.6 (19.6)). Veterans, care partners, and study nurses reported greater engagement, communication, and interaction in the video arm. CONCLUSION Video-delivered care management calls were feasible and preferred over telephone for some complex older adults with mild CI and their care partners. Future research should focus on understanding how to assess and incorporate patient and family preferences related to uptake and maintenance of video telehealth interventions.","Hastings, Susan N; Mahanna, Elizabeth P; Berkowitz, Theodore S Z; Smith, Valerie A; Choate, Ashley L; Hughes, Jaime M; Pavon, Juliessa; Robinson, Katina; Hendrix, Cristina; Van Houtven, Courtney; Gentry, Pamela; Rose, Cynthia; Plassman, Brenda L; Potter, Guy; Oddone, Eugene",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,294,1

Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between the relative muscle thickness of late pregnant cows and their early lactation performance. At 35 d before expected calving (BEC), longissimus dorsi muscle thickness (LDT) was measured in forty-one multiparous Holstein cows via ultrasound. Tissue mobilization was evaluated via ultrasound images of LDT and backfat thickness (BFT) at 21 and 7 d BEC as well as at 0, 10, 30, and 60 DIM. Plasma concentrations of 3-methylhistidine (3-MH), creatinine (CRE), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) were evaluated weekly. Milk yield and milk component data were collected through 60 DIM. Cattle were assigned post hoc to high-muscle (HM; n = 20; LDT > 4.49 cm) or low-muscle (LM; n = 21; ≤4.37 cm) groups, with mean LDT at 35 d BEC greater in HM (5.05 ± 0.49) than in LM (3.52 ± 0.65) animals. Between 35 and 21 d BEC, LM cows gained LDT, whereas HM cows gained BFT. HM cows mobilized more muscle from 21 d BEC to 30 DIM, as reflected by a greater loss of LDT, greater 3-MH concentrations (532 vs. 438 ± 30 ng/mL), and a greater 3-MH:CRE ratio (0.164 vs. 0.131 ± 0.008) in the first three weeks postpartum. The LDT and BFT at 21 d BEC were related to the amount of respective tissue mobilized through 30 DIM (R2 = 0.37 and 0.88, respectively). Although calves born to HM cattle were larger (45.2 vs. 41.8 ± 0.7 kg), HM cows produced less milk (38.8 vs. 41.6 ± 0.8 kg/d) with a tendency towards higher fat content (4.33 vs. 4.05 ± 0.12%), likely related to the mobilization of more backfat from 0 to 60 DIM (1.78 vs. 0.68 ± 0.34 mm), compared to LM cattle. These findings suggest that a cow's metabolic status, as measured by LDT and BFT prepartum, may influence the metabolic strategy the animal uses to meet energy and amino acid requirements in late gestation and early lactation.","McCabe, Conor; Suarez-Trujillo, Aridany; Casey, Theresa; Boerman, Jacquelyn",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,294,16

This implies that, compared to uncuffed tracheal tubes, the cuffed tracheal tubes selected will be smaller and therefore have a shorter length. We hypothesized that cuffed tracheal tubes might be of insufficient length for selective endobronchial intubation if the tube cuff were fully immersed in the left or right mainstem bronchus. METHODS The distance from the proximal end of the tracheal tube to the upper border of the cuff in cuffed tracheal tubes and to the upper margin of the Murphy eye in uncuffed tracheal tubes, respectively, was assessed in sizes 3.0 - 7.0 mm internal diameter. The raw data sets of two previously performed studies obtained from 337 children aged from birth to 16 years, including the distances ""teeth to tracheal tube tip"" and ""tracheal tube tip to carina"", were used to calculate age-, weight- and height-related data for the distance from ""teeth to carina"". Tracheal tube dimensions were compared with age-related distances from ""teeth to carina"", applying published recommendations for the selection of uncuffed and cuffed tracheal tubes for selective endobronchial intubation in children. RESULTS The differences between the length of the age-related tracheal tube and the tracheal tube insertion length required to guarantee full insertion of the tracheal tube cuff or the Murphy eye within the mainstem bronchus ranged from -3.5 to 52.6 mm in cuffed tracheal tubes and from 42.3 to 83.3 mm in uncuffed tracheal tubes. CONCLUSIONS For many age groups of patients requiring selective endobronchial intubation, the lengths of cuffed tracheal tubes, in contrast to those of uncuffed tracheal tubes, were revealed to be critically short for safe taping outside the oral cavity with the cuff placed completely within the right or left mainstem bronchus.","Moser, Berthold; Kemper, Michael; Dullenkopf, Alexander; Dave, Mital H; Buehler, Philipp K; Weiss, Markus",Paediatric anaesthesia,294,29

Amyloid fibrils form above the solubility of amyloidogenic proteins or peptides upon breaking supersaturation, followed by a nucleation and elongation mechanism, which is similar to the crystallization of solutes. Many additives, including salts, detergents, and natural compounds, promote or inhibit amyloid formation. However, the underlying mechanisms of the opposing effects are unclear. We examined the effects of two polyphenols, i.e., epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and kaempferol-7-O-glycoside (KG), with high and low solubilities, respectively, on the amyloid formation of α-synuclein (αSN). EGCG and KG inhibited and promoted amyloid formation of αSN, respectively, when monitored by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence or transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis revealed that, although interactions of αSN with soluble EGCG increased the solubility of αSN, thus inhibiting amyloid formation, interactions of αSN with insoluble KG reduced the solubility of αSN, thereby promoting amyloid formation. Our study suggests that opposing effects of polyphenols on amyloid formation of proteins and peptides can be interpreted based on the solubility of polyphenols.

Many laparoscopic devices have evolved to provide vascular control and tissue dissection. METHODS This is a prospective randomized study comparing the intraoperative and postoperative complications and operative time of two groups of patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. In the first group after randomization, sleeve gastrectomy was performed using Ligasure™ and in the second group Harmonic Ace® was used. RESULTS In total, 94 patients were enrolled in the study allocated in two groups. In group 1, 43 patients were operated using Ligasure™, and in group 2, 51 patients were operated using Harmonic Ace®. No significant differences were highlighted between these two groups with regards to operative time (45.0 ± 15.0 vs 40.0 ± 20.0 min, p = 0.199), intraoperative complications (32.6 vs 15.7 %, p = 0.054) and postoperative complications (4.7 vs 17.6 %, p = 0.051). CONCLUSIONS Both Ligasure™ and Harmonic Ace® provide surgeons ergonomy, and no significant differences were shown in operative time and complications.

However, there is controversy surrounding this nomenclature. We will try to find the differences between different diagnoses of hypersomnia from the results of the long-term follow-up evaluation of a sleep study. We diagnosed teenagers who had developed excessive daytime sleepiness based on the criteria of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd edition. Each individual received the same clinical neurophysiologic testing every year for 5 years after the initial diagnosis of narcolepsy type 1 (n = 111) or type 2 (n = 46). The follow-up evaluation demonstrated that narcolepsy type 1 (narcolepsy-cataplexy) is a well-defined clinical entity, with very reproducible clinical neurophysiologic findings over time, whereas patients with narcolepsy type 2 presented clear clinical and test variability. By the fifth year of the follow-up evaluation, 17.6% of subjects did not meet the diagnostic criteria of narcolepsy type 2, and 23.9% didn't show any two sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods in multiple sleep latency during the 5-year follow-up. Therefore narcolepsy type 1 (narcolepsy-cataplexy) is a well-defined syndrome, with the presentation clearly related to the known consequences of destruction of hypocretin/orexin neurons. Narcolepsy type 2 covers patients with clinical and test variability over time, thus bringing into question the usage of the term ""narcolepsy"" to label these patients.","Huang, Yu-Shu; Guilleminault, Christian; Lin, Cheng-Hui; Chen, Chia-Hsiang; Chin, Wei-Chih; Chen, Tzu-Shuang",Journal of sleep research,294,24

METHODS Classical acoustic parameters, including jitter, shimmer and NHR, as well as the CPPS were obtained for each patient with a vocal cord motility impairment confirmed by means of a fiberoptic laryngoscopy. We calculated the S/E ratio of each patient to establish the glottal efficiency. An independent sample t test and a Pearson correlation test were used to compare data. RESULTS Patients presenting a vocal cord motility impairment present abnormal values of the CPPS. Those patients presenting a vocal cord paralysis present lower values of those presenting a vocal cord paresis, with statistically significant difference (P < 0.005). CPPS and the S/E ratio present a moderate negative correlation (- 0.29). CONCLUSIONS Subjects with a vocal cord motility impairment present abnormal values for CPPS and those values are lower, the greater the motility impairment is. Therefore, CPPS presents as an objective, measurable and reproducible acoustic parameter of dysphonia that will improve the evaluation of patients presenting vocal pathologies.","Delgado-Vargas, Beatriz; Acle-Cervera, Leticia; Sánz-López, Lorena; Bonet-Loscertales, Mireya; Pérez-Naranjo, Narcisa; Fuentes-Navajo, Patricia",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,294,1

Thus, the outbreak has forced HPSs to adapt their outpatient consultation services to Telepharmacy to optimize clinical outcomes and reduce the risk of contagion. The purpose of this article is to describe and analyze the experience of HPSs with outpatient Telepharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic and expose the lessons learned. Measures have been adopted in on-site outpatient pharmacy clinics to prevent exposure of patients and professionals to the virus. These measures are based on national and international recommendations on social distancing and hygiene. With regard to remote outpatient pharmacy services, teleconsultation with drug dispensing has been promoted based on five basic procedures, each with its advantages and limitations: home drug delivery from HPSs, with the advantage of universal access and the limitation of entailing a substantial investment in resources; HPS coordination with primary care pharmacists, which requires no investments but with limited access to some geographic areas; HPS coordination with community pharmacists based on a large network of pharmacies, which requires the patient to go to the pharmacy, without confidentiality being guaranteed for any patient; geolocation and hospital-based medication dispensing, which provides universal access and direct traceability, but entails investment in human resources; and HPS coordination with associations of patients, which does not entail any additional cost but limits the information available on the diseases of society members. Three main lessons have been learned during the pandemic: the satisfactory capacity of HPS to provide outpatient pharmacy consultation services in the setting of a public health crisis; the usefulness of Telepharmacy for the clinical follow-up, healthcare coordination, outpatient counseling, and informed dispensing and delivery of medication (with a high level of satisfaction among patients); and the need to foster Telepharmacy as a complementary tool through a mixed model of outpatient pharmacy consultation service that incorporates the advantages of each procedure and adapts to the individual needs of each patient in a context of humanized healthcare.","Margusino-Framiñán, Luis; Illarro-Uranga, Aitziber; Lorenzo-Lorenzo, Karina; Monte-Boquet, Emilio; Márquez-Saavedra, Esther; Fernández-Bargiela, Noelia; Gómez-Gómez, David; Lago-Rivero, Natividad; Poveda-Andrés, José Luis; Díaz-Acedo, Rocío; Hurtado-Bouza, Juan Luis; Sánchez-Gundín, Julia; Casanova-Martínez, Cristina; Morillo-Verdugo, Ramón",Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,294,32

METHODS Individuals who visited a primary healthcare service in Sollentuna (Sweden) and agreed to participate in the programme between 1988 and 1993 were followed. They had at least one CV risk factor but no prior myocardial infarction and received support to increase physical activity using the programme Physical Activity on Prescription and to adopt health-promoting behaviours including cooking classes, weight reduction, smoking cessation and stress management. Participants (n=5761) were compared with a randomly selected, propensity score-matched reference group from the general population in Stockholm County (n=34 556). All individuals were followed in Swedish registers until December 2011. RESULTS In the intervention group and the reference group there were 698 (12.1%) and 4647 (13.4%) first CV events, 308 (5.3%) and 2261 (6.5%) CV deaths, and 919 (16.5%) and 6405 (18.5%) all-cause deaths, respectively, during a mean follow-up of 22 years. The HR (95% CI) in the intervention group compared with the reference group was 0.88 (0.81 to 0.95) for first CV events, 0.79 (0.70 to 0.89) for CV deaths and 0.83 (0.78 to 0.89) for all-cause deaths. CONCLUSIONS Participation in a CVD prevention programme in primary healthcare focusing on promotion of physical activity and healthy lifestyle was associated with lower risk of CV events (12%), CV deaths (21%) and all-cause deaths (17%) after two decades. Promoting physical activity and healthy living in the primary healthcare setting may prevent CVD.","Journath, Gunilla; Hammar, Niklas; Vikström, Max; Linnersjö, Anette; Walldius, Göran; Krakau, Ingvar; Lindgren, Peter; de Faire, Ulf; Hellenius, Mai-Lis",British journal of sports medicine,294,16

METHODS Clinical data of 48 consecutive patients aged 70 years or older, who underwent surgical resection for GBM with intraoperative ultrasonography (IoUS) alone or combination with intraoperative MRI (IoMRI) at Yale New Haven Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Variables were analyzed, and comparative analyses were performed. RESULTS The addition of IoMRI was not superior to IoUS alone in terms of overall survival (OS) (P = 0.306), Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) at postoperative 6 weeks (P = 0.704) or extent of resection (P = 0.263). Length of surgery (LOSx), however, was significantly longer (P = 0.0002) in the IoMRI group. LOSx (P = 0.015) and hospital stay (P = 0.025) were predictors of postoperative complications. Increased EOR (GTR or NTR) (P = 0.030), postoperative adjuvant treatment (P < 0.0001) and postoperative complications (P = 0.006) were predictive for OS. Patients with relatively lower preoperative KPS scores (<70) showed significant improvement at postoperative 6 weeks (P<0.0001). Patients with complications (P = 0.038) were more likely to have lower KPS at postoperative 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS Aggressive management with surgical resection should be considered in older patients with GBM, even those with relatively poor KPS. The use of ioMRI in this population does not appear to confer any measurable benefit over ioUS in experienced hands, but prolongs the length of surgery significantly, which is a preventable prognostic factor for impeding care.","Barak, Tanyeri; Vetsa, Shaurey; Nadar, Arushii; Jin, Lan; Gupte, Trisha P; Fomchenko, Elena I; Miyagishima, Danielle F; Yalcin, Kanat; Vasandani, Sagar; Gorelick, Evan; Zhao, Amy Y; Antonios, Joseph; Theriault, Brianna Carusillo; Lifton, Nathan; Marianayagam, Neelan; Omay, Bulent; Omay, Zeynep Erson; Huttner, Anita; McGuone, Declan; Blondin, Nicholas A; Corbin, Zachary; Fulbright, Robert K; Moliterno, Jennifer",Journal of neuro-oncology,294,16

The ultimate goal of TPA system was to perform proper cancer operation with less invasive access and to complement technical limitations of minimally invasive surgery. METHODS The TPA system consisted of a single multi-channel port system at the umbilicus and an ancillary 5-mm trocar in the suprapubic area. Twenty-one consecutive patients who underwent TPA staging laparoscopy for endometrial cancers were enrolled in the study. Data coming from this group of patients were prospectively collected and compared with those coming from 42 consecutive patients who underwent conventional staging laparoscopy for the same period. The selected patients were matched (1:2 ratio) to control patients based on age (± 5 years), body mass index, and tumor stage. RESULTS Patient status was estimated in operative morbidity and surgical outcomes. All operations were completed laparoscopically, with no conversion to laparotomy. The TPA group had a significantly longer operating time (238 ± 51 minutes vs 188 ± 65 minutes; P = 0.001), more retrieved para-aortic lymph nodes (13 vs 5; P < 0.001), shorter postoperative hospital stay (5 vs 8 days; P = 0.001), and less postoperative pain (P = 0.045). There were no postoperative complications requiring further management. CONCLUSIONS Two-port access staging laparoscopy using a single multi-channel port system could be a feasible procedure in selected patients with endometrial cancer with only minimal skin incisions. Prospective randomized trials will permit the evaluation of potential benefits of this minimally invasive surgical technique.","Paek, Jiheum; Nam, Eun Ji; Lee, Maria; Yim, Ga Won; Kim, Sunghoon; Kim, Young Tae; Kim, Sang Wun",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,294,24

In such situations, pregnant women are suspected of being among the vulnerable groups. The aim of this study was to report clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and obstetrical complications, maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women. We searched the Cochrane library, MEDLINE/PubMed, and Web of Sciences from their inception to April 5, 2020. Any study involving pregnant women with COVID-19 which evaluated the effect of the disease on pregnancy outcomes and fetal and neonatal complications was included in the study. The outcomes were the symptoms and laboratory findings, obstetrical complications, mode of delivery, and maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications. The search resulted in 69 titles and abstracts, which were narrowed down to 12 studies involving 68 women. The three most common symptoms of patients were fever, cough, and fatigue. The most common laboratory findings were an increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) and lymphopenia. The most common obstetrical complication was preterm labor (33.3%). No maternal deaths were reported. The Cesarean section rate was 83.3% and the vertical transition rate was 2.23%. The findings showed that the clinical symptoms and laboratory measures of pregnant women affected by COVID-19 did not differ from the general population. In general, the prognosis of mothers who suffered from COVID-19 and their newborns was satisfactory. However, there is a need for further rigorous studies to confirm these findings as the pandemic progresses.","Makvandi, Somayeh; Mahdavian, Mitra; Kazemi-Nia, Goli; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Guest, Paul C; Karimi, Leila; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,294,31

OBJECTIVES To determine the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen in the treatment of the common cold in adults. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 1, Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to January week 5, 2013), EMBASE (1980 to February 2013), CINAHL (1982 to February 2013) and LILACS (1985 to February 2013). SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acetaminophen to placebo or no treatment in adults with the common cold. Studies were included if the trials used acetaminophen as one ingredient of a combination therapy. We excluded studies in which the participants had complications. Primary outcomes included subjective symptom score and duration of common cold symptoms. Secondary outcomes were overall well being, adverse events and financial costs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We performed standard statistical analyses. MAIN RESULTS We included four RCTs involving 758 participants. We did not pool data because of heterogeneity in study designs, outcomes and time points. The studies provided sparse information about effects longer than a few hours, as three of four included studies were short trials of only four to six hours. Participants treated with acetaminophen had significant improvements in nasal obstruction in two of the four studies. One study showed that acetaminophen was superior to placebo in decreasing rhinorrhoea severity, but was not superior for treating sneezing and coughing. Acetaminophen did not improve sore throat or malaise in two of the four studies. Results were inconsistent for some symptoms. Two studies showed that headache and achiness improved more in the acetaminophen group than in the placebo group, while one study showed no difference between the acetaminophen and placebo group. None of the included studies reported the duration of common cold symptoms. Minor side effects (including gastrointestinal adverse events, dizziness, dry mouth, somnolence and increased sweating) in the acetaminophen group were reported in two of the four studies. One of them used a combination of pseudoephedrine and acetaminophen. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Acetaminophen may help relieve nasal obstruction and rhinorrhoea but does not appear to improve some other cold symptoms (including sore throat, malaise, sneezing and cough). However, two of the four included studies in this review were small and allocation concealment was unclear in all four studies. The data in this review do not provide sufficient evidence to inform practice regarding the use of acetaminophen for the common cold in adults. Further large-scale, well-designed trials are needed to determine whether this intervention is beneficial in the treatment of adults with the common cold.","Li, Siyuan; Yue, Jirong; Dong, Bi Rong; Yang, Ming; Lin, Xiufang; Wu, Taixiang",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,294,16

The lack of effective therapeutics for the management of the pandemic calls for the discovery of new drugs and vaccines. OBJECTIVE In the present study, a chemical library was screened for molecules against three coronavirus 3CL-like protease enzymes (SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, SARS-CoV 3CLpro and MERS-CoV 3CLpro), which are a key player in the viral replication cycle. METHODS Extensive computational methods, such as virtual screening and molecular docking, were employed in this study. RESULTS Two lead molecules- ZINC08825480 (4-bromo-N'-{(E)-[1-phenyl-3-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]methylidene}benzene-1-sulfonohydrazide) and ZINC72009942 (N-[[2-[[(3S)-3-methyl-1-piperidyl]methyl]phenyl]methyl]-6-oxo-1-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-triazine-3-carboxamide) were identified with better affinity with the three target enzymes as compared to the approved antiviral drugs. Both the lead molecules possess favourable drug-like properties, fit well into the active site pocket close to His-Cys dyad and show a good number of hydrogen bonds with the backbone as well as side chains of key amino acid residues. CONCLUSION Thus, the present study offers two novel chemical entities against coronavirus infections, which can be validated through various biological assays.","Gurung, Arun Bahadur; Al-Anazi, Khalid Mashay; Ali, Mohammad Ajmal; Lee, Joongku; Farah, Mohammad Abul",Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,294,32

Living with a stoma has potential to impair the patient's quality of life, often with associated negative psychological effects. Objective To evaluate the quality of life among intestinal stoma patients under Mulago National Referral Hospital (MNRH), with emphasis on psychological effects and effects on family-social interactions. Methodology A cross-sectional study carried out at surgical outpatient clinics of MNRH between January and June 2018. Data was collected using Stoma-QOL questionnaire, PHQ-9 and GAD-7 from 51 participants who had lived with intestinal stomas for at least a month. Results Of the 51 participants, male: female ratio was 4:1 and aged 18-84 years (mean age 44.04+18.47 years). 76.5% had colostomy; 23.5% had ileostomy. Majority (88.2%) had temporary stomas. The overall mean Stoma-QOL score was 55.12+ 17.04. Only about a quarter (24%) of participants had Stoma-QOL scores >70 (best). Most patients exhibited negative psychological effects (anxiety-100%, concerns about changed body image - 96.1% and depression - 88.4%). Conclusion Most participants had low levels of stoma-related quality of life, suffered negative psychological effects and exhibited limited social interactions. This calls for efforts to support Stoma patients adapt beter life.","Ssewanyana, Yasin; Ssekitooleko, Badru; Suuna, Bashir; Bua, Emmanuel; Wadeya, Joseph; Makumbi, Timothy K; Ocen, William; Omona, Kizito",African health sciences,294,1

RECENT FINDINGS Precision medicine is most applicable to the timing of RRT in critically ill patients. As recent randomized controlled trials have failed to provide consensus on when to initiate acute RRT, the decision to start acute RRT should be based on individual patient clinical characteristics (e.g. severity of the disease, evolution of clinical parameters) and logistic considerations (e.g. organizational issues, availability of machines and disposables). The delivery of a dynamic dialytic dose is another application of precision medicine, as patients may require different and varying dialysis doses depending on individual patient factors and clinical course. Although regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) is recommended as first-line anticoagulation for continuous RRT, modifications to RCA protocols and consideration of other anticoagulants should be individualized to the patient's clinical condition. Finally, the evolution of RRT technology has improved precision in dialysis delivery through increased machine accuracy, connectivity to the electronic medical record and automated reduction of downtime. SUMMARY RRT has become a complex treatment for critically ill patients, which allows for the prescription to be precisely tailored to the different clinical requirements.","Ricci, Zaccaria; Tolwani, Ashita; Lumlertgul, Nuttha",Current opinion in critical care,294,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective, single center analysis of patients with acute ischemic stroke with occlusion of the internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery (M1 segment) who underwent endovascular therapy using a Penumbra system. The reperfusion success rate, puncture-to-revascularization time, and number of passes were assessed. Multivariate regression analysis was conducted to evaluate independent factors related to revascularization within 60 minutes. Successful revascularization was defined by a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score ≥2b. RESULTS The Penumbra 5MAX ACE was used in 24 of the 40 patients (60%). Although the revascularization success rate was similar between patient groups (P = .229), the number of passes was significantly lower (1.5 ± .8 versus 2.6 ± 1.3, P = .006) and the puncture-to-revascularization time was shorter (50 ± 26 minutes versus 116 ± 69 minutes, P = .002) in patients treated with the Penumbra 5MAX ACE. The Penumbra 5MAX ACE was identified as an independent factor for early revascularization (odds ratio, 5.80; P = .041). Among patients with a premorbid modified Rankin Scale score of 0-1, a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 3 months was observed in 15 of the 19 patients (79%) treated with the Penumbra 5MAX ACE and in 8 of the 16 (50%) who were not (P = .072). CONCLUSION Acute revascularization therapy using the Penumbra 5MAX ACE can achieve rapid successful recanalization and tend to improve clinical outcomes.","Suzuki, Kentaro; Aoki, Junya; Sakamoto, Yuki; Kanamaru, Takuya; Abe, Arata; Suda, Satoshi; Okubo, Seiji; Kimura, Kazumi",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,294,1

Owing to the rapid spread, almost 22 million people became infected and 700,000 died. Similar to other countries, the need for additional hospital beds and intensive care units required diversion of health care resources toward the care for those with COVID-19 in Turkey. Telemedicine appeared as a safe and low-cost alternative for the maintainability of pediatric health services during the pandemics. Within this context, we aimed to deliver the health services through telemedicine during the follow-up of chronic childhood diseases. Materials and Methods: This prospective study included five pediatric subspecialties, including allergy immunology, hematology and oncology, nephrology, rheumatology, and inborn metabolic disorders. After the interview, patients and involved physicians were requested to fill out a questionnaire designed to measure the level of satisfaction and the quality of the service we offered. Results: Of the 263 interviews, overall patient and physician satisfaction was 99% and 87%, respectively. As results of the interviews, 250 routine visits were performed, 181 acute complaints were assessed, drug changes were made in 118 patients, 9 patients were determined to be unable to get their drugs, and 12 who misused their drugs. The main advantage of the telemedicine declared by the patients was ""not to waste time for transportation."" The main concerns of the participants were inability to perform physical and laboratory examinations. Conclusion: Consequently, we considered telemedicine as a feasible alternative not only during pandemics but also in daily practice in Turkey.","Aydemir, Sezin; Ocak, Suheyla; Saygılı, Seha; Hopurcuoğlu, Duhan; Haşlak, Fatih; Kıykım, Ertuğrul; Aktuğlu Zeybek, Çiğdem; Celkan, Tiraje; Demirgan, Ebru Burcu; Kasapçopur, Özgür; Çokuğraş, Haluk; Kıykım, Ayça; Canpolat, Nur",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,294,1

Previous studies have shown a correlation between low renal tissue oxygenation (RrSO2) in the first 24 hours of age and the later development of AKI. In this prospective clinical trial, NIRS monitoring was used to identify changes in RrSO2 in comparison to traditional AKI markers, serum creatinine (SCr), and urine output (UOP). METHODS We enrolled 35 preterm neonates born less than 32 weeks' gestation and applied neonatal NIRS sensors at less than 48 hours of age. Neonates underwent 7 days of continuous monitoring. Renal and demographic information were collected for the first 7 days of age. AKI was determined by the modified neonatal Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition including UOP. RESULTS Three patients experienced AKI, all based on both SCr and UOP criteria. Each neonate with AKI had decreases in RrSO2 over 48 hours prior to changes in SCr and UOP. Patients with AKI had lower median RrSO2 values compared to patients without AKI over the first week of age, (32.4% vs. 60%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION RrSO2 monitoring identified preterm neonates at risk for AKI. NIRS detected a decline in RrSO2 prior to changes in SCr and UOP and was significantly lower in patients with AKI compared to those without AKI. Further studies are needed to evaluate the ability of RrSO2 monitoring to detect signs of kidney stress prior to the diagnosis of AKI.

Here, we perform a genome-wide CRISPR screen using an endogenous cholesterol reporter and identify >100 genes involved in LDL-cholesterol import. We characterise C18orf8 as a core subunit of the mammalian Mon1-Ccz1 guanidine exchange factor (GEF) for Rab7, required for complex stability and function. C18orf8-deficient cells lack Rab7 activation and show severe defects in late endosome morphology and endosomal LDL trafficking, resulting in cellular cholesterol deficiency. Unexpectedly, free cholesterol accumulates within swollen lysosomes, suggesting a critical defect in lysosomal cholesterol export. We find that active Rab7 interacts with the NPC1 cholesterol transporter and licenses lysosomal cholesterol export. This process is abolished in C18orf8-, Ccz1- and Mon1A/B-deficient cells and restored by a constitutively active Rab7. The trimeric Mon1-Ccz1-C18orf8 (MCC) GEF therefore plays a central role in cellular cholesterol homeostasis coordinating Rab7 activation, endosomal LDL trafficking and NPC1-dependent lysosomal cholesterol export.","van den Boomen, Dick J H; Sienkiewicz, Agata; Berlin, Ilana; Jongsma, Marlieke L M; van Elsland, Daphne M; Luzio, J Paul; Neefjes, Jacques J C; Lehner, Paul J",Nature communications,294,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS Hyperoxic lung injured mice were used as the disease model. Pulmonary fibrosis was determined by H&E and Masson's staining. Autophagy was investigated by western blot, immunofluorescence staining, and transmission electron microscopy. KEY FINDINGS We observed that increased CX3CR1 expression corresponded with increased pulmonary fibrosis. Additionally, silencing of CX3CR1 significantly alleviated the fibrosis when compared to the control. We observed that exposure of mouse to hyperoxic environment increased macrophage levels along with an increased CD11b expression in the lung tissues. Subsequently, we also observed an increased expression of LC3-II and decreased p62 expression in hyperoxic mice models, suggesting the potential role of hyperoxia induced autophagy. CD11b and LC3/CX3CR1 were expressed and co-localized in a manner indicating CX3CR1 indeed does regulate macrophage autophagy in the hyperoxic lung injury model. We observed a decrease in hyperoxia-associated fibrosis, along with a decrease in autophagy when we used 3-MA (autophagy inhibitor) in our hyperoxic lung injury model. To elucidate the pathway through which CX3CR1 regulated autophagy, we further analyzed the Akt1 pathway. Our experimental results indicated that the Akt1 inhibitor (A-674563) did significantly decrease macrophage autophagy and fibrosis in hyperoxic mice models. SIGNIFICANCE Thus, our data indicates a novel role of CX3CR1 in regulation of macrophage autophagy and promotion of pulmonary fibrosis in hyperoxic lung injured mice.","Chen, Yuqing; Zhang, Hai; Li, Feng; Wang, Xiaohui",Life sciences,294,8

Based on the upregulated proteins found in the proteomic analysis, we found that increased cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) levels promoted greater hydrogen sulfide (H2S) synthesis in the liver. This investigation provides novel evidence that sub-chronic administration of KRG can elevate H2S production by increasing protein expression of CBS and CSE in the liver.","Na, Ann-Yae; Jo, Jung Jae; Kwon, Oh Kwang; Cho, Piljoung; Gao, Yan; Kim, Ju-Hyun; Kim, Kyu Min; Ki, Sung Hwan; Lee, Sangkyu",Scientific reports,294,1

In the present study, we aimed to screen microRNA (miRNA) markers in serum exosomes for differential diagnosis of high-grade glioma and intracranial lymphoma using high-throughput sequencing technology. Methods Patients with intracranial lymphoma or high-grade glioma and healthy controls were included in this study (training cohort (n = 10) and validation cohort: intracranial lymphoma (n = 10), high-grade glioma (n = 32), and healthy controls (n = 20)). After RNA was extracted from serum exosomes, the high-throughput sequencing was used to determine the expression profiles of serum exosomal miRNAs and screen the differentially expressed miRNAs. RT-qPCR was used to verify the expressions of the selected miRNAs. The differences of miRNA expressions between groups were assessed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The diagnostic value was analyzed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results High-throughput sequencing demonstrated that 170 miRNAs, including 109 upregulated ones and 61 downregulated ones, were differentially expressed in serum exosomes between the patients with intracranial lymphoma and high-grade glioma. Compared with the healthy controls, the number of differential serum exosomal miRNAs in the high-grade glioma group and intracranial lymphoma group was 130 and 173, respectively. RT-qPCR proved that both miR-766-5p and miR-376b-5p were significantly downregulated in high-grade glioma and intracranial lymphoma patients compared with the healthy controls (all p < 0.001), and the expression of serum exosomal miR-766-5p in the intracranial lymphoma group was lower compared with the high-grade glioma group (p < 0.05). The areas under ROC curve (AUCs) of serum exosomal miR-766-5p and miR-376b-5p for the diagnosis of glioma were 0.8883 (p < 0.001) and 0.7688 (p = 0.001), respectively, and they were 0.9271 (p < 0.001) and 0.8542 (p < 0.001), respectively, for the diagnosis of intracranial lymphoma. Moreover, the AUC value of serum exosomal miR-766-5p for the differential diagnosis of glioma and intracranial lymphoma was 0.7201 (p = 0.026). Conclusions miR-766-5p and miR-376b-5p in serum exosomes might be used as auxiliary diagnostic indicators for high-grade glioma and intracranial lymphoma, and miR-766-5p might be used as a differential diagnostic marker for both diseases.","Wang, Shun; Xu, Zhenkuan; Zhang, Chao; Yu, Rui; Jiang, Jun; Wang, Chengwei; Qu, Chuncheng",BioMed research international,294,20

To investigate the totality of forces shaping dimorphism, we reparameterized the Lande equation to predict changes in trait averages and trait differences between the sexes. As genetic constraints on the evolution of dimorphism in response to antagonistic selection become larger, dimorphism will tend to respond more rapidly to concordant selection (which favors the same direction of change in male and female traits) than to antagonistic selection. When we apply this theory to four empirical estimates of B in Drosophila melanogaster, the indirect responses of dimorphism to concordant selection are of comparable or larger magnitude than the direct responses of dimorphism to antagonistic selection in two suites of traits with typical levels of intersex correlation. Antagonistic selection is more important in two suites of traits where the intersex correlations are unusually low. This suggests that the evolution of sexual dimorphism may sometimes be dominated by concordant selection rather than antagonistic selection.","Cheng 成常德, Changde; Houle, David",The American naturalist,294,16

The use of LUS is recommended to minimize transfers in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the pandemic. The clinical efficacies of bedside chest X-ray (CXR) and LUS have not been compared in these patients. Herein, we demonstrated serial LUS changes in a 75-year-old woman recovering from COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in need of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. LUS initially revealed extensive consolidation in the bilateral lower lung (BLL) fields with coalescent B-lines. While the patient recovered from ARDS, the findings gradually changed to discrete B-lines and small pleural consolidations. The LUS findings were more sensitive than those of the CXR in detecting re-expansion of the lungs by showing B-lines instead of consolidations in the BLL fields immediately after recruitment maneuver (RM). Compared with physiological parameters, LUS findings provided more precise information about the parts of the lungs that had been recruited by RM. Therefore, we encourage intensivists to extend their use of LUS in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS to acquire real-time information for a quick response and minimize the risk of viral transmission.","Hsiao, Yi-Han; Lin, Yi-Tsung; Liao, Hsien-Tzung; Yang, Kuang-Yao; Chen, Yuh-Min",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,294,16

Patients and carers require increasing input from specialist palliative care services to both manage symptoms and access support in the last year of life. An integrated clinical service between the local cardiology team at Princess Royal University Hospital and the palliative care team at St. Christopher's Hospice was piloted for patients with end-stage heart failure in Bromley in Kent, UK. This study explored views of patients and carers who participated in the integrated pilot service. METHODS A qualitative study was conducted in which a convenience sample of patients and carers were invited to participate in focus groups: two bereaved carer groups (n=2, n=2); one patient group (n=4), held between 14th December 2018 and 18th January 2019. Participants were asked to describe their experiences of care received facilitated by a topic guide. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded using thematic analysis to identify common themes. RESULTS Four patients (2:2 M:F) aged between 70 to 87 years and four female carers whom had cared for patients aged between 70 to 96 years who were since deceased, participated in this study. Overall, the service was positively received, and responses were mapped into four key areas; being diagnosed and living with heart failure, referral to palliative care, key helpful components of the care received and finally, unhelpful components of the new service in terms of care. Common themes emerged including understanding of heart failure and its trajectory, communication around palliative care, having a 'broker' for the system, recognition of carer's needs, service responsiveness, and feeling 'in control'. CONCLUSIONS This qualitative study highlighted important considerations when developing an integrated heart failure and palliative care service. Education about heart failure for patients and carers, but also the integrated multidisciplinary team is crucial to improving detection of deterioration and facilitating communication around Advance Care Planning. The value of the 'expert-carer' should also be promoted and supported in chronic conditions. We recommend a focus on development of integrated services that enable joined-up care or single point of contact for patients and carers.","Chester, Rosemary; Richardson, Heather; Doyle, Christopher; Hodson, Fiona; Ross, Joy R",Annals of palliative medicine,294,7

Multidrug-resistant Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus represents a major problem in Egyptian hospitals. The over-expression of efflux pumps is a main cause of multidrug resistance. The discovery of efflux pump inhibitors may help fight multidrug resistance by sensitizing bacteria to antibiotics. This study aimed to investigate the role of efflux pumps in multidrug resistance. Methods Twenty multidrug resistant S. aureus isolates were selected. Efflux pumps were screened by ethidium bromide agar cartwheel method and polymerase chain reaction. The efflux pump inhibition by seven agents was tested by ethidium bromide agar cartwheel method and the effect on sensitivity to selected antimicrobials was investigated by broth microdilution method. Results Seventy percent of isolates showed strong efflux activity, while 30% showed intermediate activity. The efflux genes mdeA, norB, norC, norA and sepA were found to play the major role in efflux, while genes mepA, smr and qacA/B had a minor role. Verapamil and metformin showed significant efflux inhibition and increased the sensitivity to tested antimicrobials, while vildagliptin, atorvastatin, domperidone, mebeverine and nifuroxazide showed no effect. Conclusion Efflux pumps are involved in multidrug resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. Efflux pump inhibitors could increase the sensitivity to antimicrobials.","Baiomy, Amr A; Shaker, Ghada H; Abbas, Hisham A",African health sciences,294,16

Our aim was to identify and collate all the available data and to assess for statistical differences in patient outcomes between the two treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies with a randomised controlled design which utilised stentrievers and intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischaemic stroke. RESULTS Five randomised controlled studies published in 2015 were identified. Second-generation thrombectomy devices constituted at least 80% of thrombectomy devices in the included studies, namely MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, EXTEND-IA, SWIFT PRIME and REVASCAT. No significant heterogeneity was seen in the included studies and the five trials were therefore included in the meta-analysis.A total of 46.10% of patients treated with stentrievers achieved an independent functional outcome (mRS < 2) at 90 days compared with 26.46% of those treated with intravenous thrombolysis with an odds ratio of 2.40 (p < 0.001). The weighted recanalisation mean in the thrombectomy arms was 76.02%.A lower mortality rate was observed with stentrievers compared to intravenous thrombolysis (15.33% vs 18.74%; OR 0.81, p = 0.15). Stentrievers were also associated with a lower risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (7.86% vs 8.64%; OR 1.02, p = 0.93). The differences in the secondary/safety outcomes were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION Stentrievers can achieve a high rate of recanalisation and functional independence in acute ischaemic stroke and have a relatively good safety profile. Our meta-analysis demonstrates a clear benefit of an intra-arterial mechanical approach vs standard treatment.","Grech, Reuben; Schembri, Mark; Thornton, John","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",294,28

Stimulation of the cholecystokinin-1 receptor-dependent vagal anti-inflammatory reflex with lipid-rich enteral nutrition was demonstrated to prevent tissue damage and attenuate inflammation. This study investigates the effects of nutritional activation of the vagal anti-inflammatory reflex on organ integrity, systemic inflammation, and microcirculation during hemolysis. DESIGN Prospective randomized controlled study. SETTING University research unit. SUBJECTS Male Sprague-Dawley rats. INTERVENTIONS Intravascular hemolysis was simulated by infusion of prelysed erythrocytes. Animals were fasted or received lipid-rich enteral nutrition. Pegylated (PEG)-CCK9A, A70104 (a cholecystokinin-1 receptor antagonist), and chlorisondamine (a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist) were applied to investigate involvement of the vagal reflex. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Nutritional intervention reduced hemolysis-related renal tubular cell damage, hepatocyte damage, ileal leakage of horseradish peroxidase, and bacterial translocation compared with food deprivation (all p < 0.05). Also circulating interleukin (IL)-6 levels were decreased by enteral nutrition (p < 0.05). Blockage of the cholecystokinin-1 receptor or the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor reversed the protective nutritional effects compared with vehicle (p < 0.05), whereas PEG-CCK9 mimicked the impact of enteral feeding in fasted animals (p < 0.05). Furthermore, nutritional intervention increased renal, hepatic, and intestinal blood flow compared with fasting (all p < 0.05), as evaluated using fluorescent microspheres. CONCLUSIONS Nutritional activation of the vagal anti-inflammatory reflex preserves tissue integrity and attenuates systemic inflammation in a rodent model of acute hemolysis. In addition, lipid-rich nutrition improves renal, hepatic, and intestinal microcirculation. These findings implicate stimulation of the autonomic nervous system by nutritional means as a potential therapy to prevent complications of acute hemolysis.

However, material synthesis techniques for producing CSSPs economically in batch processes remain elusive. In this report, a practical and straightforward method for the preparation of CSSPs is presented. By refluxing freshly prepared nonporous silica particles in ammonia-water solution in the presence of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) at 70-100 °C, CSSPs with shell thicknesses of up to 300 nm and pore sizes from 8 to 25 nm were easily prepared. The effects of the synthetic conditions on the shell thickness, surface area, and pore size were investigated in detail, and the method reproducibility was evaluated in scale-up experiments. A mechanism of CSSP formation is also proposed. The CSSPs were characterized via scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, laser particle size (dynamic light scattering) analysis, and nitrogen adsorption and desorption experiments. The synthesized 3.4-μm CSSPs were functionalized with dimethyloctadecylchlorosilane and used as an HPLC packing material, exhibiting excellent separation performance for both small molecules and large biomolecules. In summary, we report the simplest method developed thus far for the preparation of monodisperse core-shell silica particles suitable for HPLC column packing.","Wu, Yaling; Sun, Xiaotong; Zhu, Junchen; Shen, Jiawei; Wang, Huiying; Zhu, Lunan; Zhou, Yang; Ke, Yanxiong",Journal of chromatography.

We here test whether a meta-GGA that has recently been developed with a focus on capturing nonlocal response properties and the particle number discontinuity can realize such features in practice. To this end, we extended the frequency-dependent Sternheimer formalism to the meta-GGA case. Using the Krieger-Li-Iafrate (KLI) approximation, we calculate the optical response for the selected paradigm molecular systems and compare the meta-GGA Kohn-Sham response to the one found with exact exchange and conventional (semi-)local functionals. We find that the new meta-GGA captures important properties of the nonlocal exchange response.

To date, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We detected leukocyte DNA N6-methyladenine (6mA) levels in CKD patients with or without aortic arch calcification. We used arteries from CKD mice infected with vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)-targeted adeno-associated virus encoding alkB homolog 1 (Alkbh1) gene or Alkbh1 shRNA to evaluate features of calcification. We identified that leukocyte 6mA levels were significantly reduced as the severity of VC increased in CKD patients. Decreased 6mA demethylation resulted from the upregulation of ALKBH1. Here, ALKBH1 overexpression aggravated, whereas its depletion blunted VC progression and osteogenic reprogramming in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, ALKBH1-demethylated DNA 6mA modification could facilitate the binding of octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4) to bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) promoter and activate BMP2 transcription. This resulted in osteogenic reprogramming of VSMCs and subsequent VC progression. Either BMP2 or Oct4 depletion alleviated the pro-calcifying effects of ALKBH1. This suggests targeting ALKBH1 might be a therapeutic method to reduce the burden of VC in CKD.","Ouyang, Liu; Su, Xiaoyan; Li, Wenxin; Tang, Liangqiu; Zhang, Mengbi; Zhu, Yongjun; Xie, Changming; Zhang, Puhua; Chen, Jie; Huang, Hui",The Journal of clinical investigation,294,17

A way to handle such spreads is through a containment strategy, where the population in the affected area is isolated until the spread has been stopped. Under such circumstances, it is important to monitor whether the mutated virus is extinct via massive testing for the virus sub-type. If successful, the strategy will lead to lower and lower numbers of the sub-type, and it will eventually die out. An important question is, for how long time one should wait to be sure the sub-type is extinct? We use a hidden Markov model for infection spread and an approximation of a two stage sampling scheme to infer the probability of extinction. The potential of the method is illustrated via a simulation study. Finally, the model is used to assess the Danish containment strategy when SARS-CoV-2 spread from mink to man during the summer of 2020, including the Cluster-5 sub-type. In order to avoid further spread and mink being a large animal virus reservoir, this situation led to the isolation of seven municipalities in the Northern part of the country, the culling of the entire Danish 17 million large mink population, and a bill to interim ban Danish mink production until the end of 2021.","Schioler, H.; Knudsen, T.; Brondum, R.

A selectivity for SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease over human cathepsins B, S and L was also observed with the nitrile warhead, which was superior to that with the aldehyde warhead. A co-crystal structure with SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease and a reversibility study indicate that a reversible, thioimidate adduct is formed when the catalytic sulfur forms a covalent bond with the carbon of the nitrile. This effort also identified efflux as a property limiting antiviral activity of these compounds, and together with the positive attributes described these results provide insight for further drug development of novel nitrile peptidomimetics targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease.","Bai, B.; Arutyunova, E.; Khan, M.

Constitutive models of metallic materials are conventionally obtained by dynamic compression tests such as the Split-Hopkinson (Kolsky) bar test at lower strain (ε < 0.3) and strain rate (103/s to 104/s). To compare the flow stress obtained from both tests under identical conditions, the strain in the primary shear zone (PSZ) in orthogonal cutting tests has been lowered using high rake angle (α = 45°) cutting tools to ε ≈ 0.8, and by adding chip pulling to ε ≈ 0.5. To our knowledge this is the first time that flow stress estimates are obtained from machining at such low strain values. With some modifications, the strain in Kolsky bar testing has been increased up to ε = 0.8, and the stress-strain curve obtained is compared to flow stress estimates from orthogonal cutting tests under the same strain and similar strain rates. The results work, show for the first time, that the flow stress measured from cutting tests agree closely with those obtained from Kolsky bar testing.","Cui, Changlong; Bhavsar, Pavan; Lopez-Hawa, Homar; Madhavan, Vis; Moscoso-Kingsley, Wilfredo",Procedia Manufacturing,294,1

First, for the traffic volume and manufacturing PMI time-series data, unit root stability test and Johansen cointegration test are applied to determine the stability of single sequence and the long-term stable correlation between variables, respectively. Then, a time-varying vector autoregressive model (TVP-VAR) is developed to quantify the time-varying correlation between variables. The time-varying parameters of TVP-VAR are estimated using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) theory. Finally, the model is validated using examples from China. In the numeric example, three variables, i.e., expressway car traffic volume, expressway truck traffic volume, and manufacturing PMI, are selected for analysis. Results show that there is a positive interaction between expressway traffic volume (both car and truck) and manufacturing PMI. Express traffic volume slowly promotes the development of manufacturing industry. However, with the reform policy of road freight structure in China, the promotion effect of truck traffic on manufacturing PMI in the past two years has decreased significantly. Moreover, as affected by the China demand-led economic development model in recent years, the stimulus effect of manufacturing PMI on expressway passenger traffic volume has increased year by year. And, while the expressway freight structure remains stable, truck traffic volume is hardly affected by fluctuations in manufacturing PMI. These research results are helpful for policy makers to understand the time-varying coupling relationship between expressway traffic volume and manufacturing development and finally to improve the expressway management level.","Sun, Shuo Gu Mingchen Wang Yingping Lin Rongjie Xing Lifeng Xu Zhiyuan",Journal of Advanced Transportation,294,17

At the same time, it is possible that existing medications can help in the fight against this disease. The local antiseptic drug benzidamine hydrochloride in the early stages of illness can prevent the virus from entering the lower respiratory tract and potentially reduce the severe illness associated with pneumonia and, as a result, reduce COVID-19-related hospitalizations, which can significantly reduce the burden on the health care system. The aim: to evaluate the antiviral activity of benzidamine hydrochloride against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Material and methods. Antiviral properties of benzidamine hydrochloride were studied in vitro in non-toxic concentrations on monolayer of Vero-E6 cells infected with pandemic strain of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in treatment and prophylactic scheme of the compound and virus administration. Results. Benzidamine hydrochloride has antiviral activity (15,0 mcg/ml), the efficiency of its antiviral action is directly proportional to the concentration of the substance. Conclusions. Taking into account very limited range of antiviral drugs with direct action on SARS-CoV-2 virus, the studied preparation can be used in complex therapy at early stages of the disease, which can prevent virus penetration into lower respiratory tract and potentially reduce the number of complications. © 2021, Numikom.

In a preregistered study in a representative German-speaking Swiss sample (N = 757), the roles of individual risk perceptions, risk preferences, social preferences, and social values in the acceptance of and compliance with DCTA were compared. The results show a high compliance with the measures recommended by DCTAs but a comparatively low acceptance of DCTAs. Risk preferences and perceptions, but not social preferences, influenced accepting DCTAs;a high health-risk perception and a low data-security-risk perception increased acceptance. Additionally, support of political measures, technical abilities, and understanding the DCTA functionality had large effects on accepting DCTAs. Therefore, we recommend highlighting personal health risks and clearly explaining DCTAs, focusing on data security, to enhance DCTA acceptance.","Albrecht, Rebecca Jarecki Jana B.; Meier, Dominik S.; Rieskamp, Jörg",Humanities & Social Sciences Communications,294,28

Due to the development of advanced in vitro techniques, they have become an integral part of modern medicine. The sources of human stem cells are primarily bone marrow and adipose tissue, although non – embryonic stem cells are also scattered throughout the body. Notably, recent research has focused on stem cells found in the oral cavity, both in the dental pulp and oral mucosa. Furthermore, isolation of stem cells from umbilical cord blood is also becoming increasingly popular, while wharton’s jelly and amniotic fluid also seem to be an interesting source of stem cells. The safety and efficacy of stem cells use can be established by animal studies, which are a key element of preclinical research. Mouse, rat and pig models allow for testing of stem cell therapies. Recent studies primarily use mesenchymal stem cells such as mouse – adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells and mouse and rat hematopoietic stem cells. Great hope for future therapies is the use of bioengineering to program cells into induced stem cells, which have the biggest ability for differentiation and transdifferentiation, which carries no risk of teratogenesis. Stem cells are used in many areas of medicine, especially in regenerative medicine, with a growing interest in orthopedics and in the treatment of heart failure. Mesenchymal stem cells are the most used stem cell type, which despite their limited ability to differentiate, give great therapeutic results, mainly due to their immunomodulating effect. Recent studies have even shown that the use of mesenchymal stem cells may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, Research on the use of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of Crohn’s disease, acute-graft-versus-host disease and type I diabetes are also promising.

Approximately 15% of patients will develop a distress syndrome responsible in most cases of mortality. A host hyperinflammatory response induced by a cytokine storm, is the main cause of this severe complication. Chemotherapy myelosuppression is associated with higher risk of infections and mortality in cancer patients. There have been no previous reports about the clinical management of patients with neutropenia and concomitant COVID- 19. Herein, we present a multicenter experience in several hospitals during COVID-19 outbreak in neutropenic cancer patients infected by SARSCov- 2. Methods: Retrospective clinical data were collected from clinical reports. Protocol was approved by a Clinical Research Ethics Committee (HULP: PI-4194). Inclusion criteria were cancer patients with neutropenia (&lt;1500 cells/mm3) and concomitant COVID-19 infection. Comorbidities, tumor type and stage, treatment, neutropenia severity, filgrastim (G-CSF), COVID-19 parameters and mortality were analyzed. Exploratory analysis included a description of all data collected and bivariate analyses among different pairs of variables, including their impact in mortality in this cohort. In addition, multivariable logistic regression was used to predict respiratory failure and death as a function of multiple variables. Results: Among 943 patients with cancer screened in 14 hospitals in Spain, eighty-three patients (8%) had a febrile neutropenia and COVID-19 infection. Lung (26%), breast (22%), colorectal (13%) and digestive noncolorectal (17%) cancers were the main locations and most patients had advanced disease (67%). Fifty-three (63%) of patients included died because respiratory failure. Neumonia was presented in 76% of patients, bilateral in 47% and 12% of all patients had thrombotic events. The median of neutrophils was 650cls/mm3 and 49% received GCSF with a median of days on treatment around 4,5 days. Among all variables related with mortality in neutropenic cancer patients with COVID-19 infection, we found that the number of days with GCSF showed a significant trend toward worse outcome and higher mortality. In particular, a logistic regression model was developed to predict respiratory failure, as a function of the number of days of G-CSF treatment. As adjusting covariates, sex, age, treatment purpose (palliative vs curative, to adjust for patient status), tumor type, and the lowest level of neutrophils in the patient (to adjust for neutropenic status) were used.

Schools and universities shifted from classroom to online teaching, and the education system needed to adapt to the new form of organization. The paper provides a study on how teachers from Romania dealt with professional challenges, as part of a changing education system. The research aimed to analyse the impact of professional changes on teaching in Romania, between March and June 2020 and to identify the main predictors of work engagement, in the context of teleworking. The research was performed on a sample of 400 teachers from Romania, representative for the entire population of teachers from all Romanian forms of education, with a confidence interval of 5% and a confidence level of 95%. We collected data based on scales and indicators that were validated for the Romanian context and proposed a factorial model, tested subsequently with confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM). The results show that perceived student engagement and motivation are major determinants of work engagement in teaching. © 2021, Amfiteatru Economic.

The disease begins as a respiratory disease with varied outcomes, from complete recovery to long-standing complications, such as respiratory distress, heart ailments and stroke. The present study was undertaken to identify the derangements in liver function and inflammatory status which may be used to diagnose the severity and thus assess the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 infection. The present study was conducted at a tertiary care teaching hospital. The study population included 456 patients with COVID-19, confirmed by the reverse transcription-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2. Data were collected from patient files. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Data are expressed based on the normality of distribution. Variables were compared and correlation analyses were performed. Receiver operating characteristics and the Youden index were applied to obtain cut-off values. The results revealed an increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin levels. In addition, there was evidence of leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia and an increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). The NLR exhibited an area under the curve of 0.77, with a cut-off value of 2.23 mg/l. Collectively, the findings of the present study demonstrate that the CRP, LDH, neutrophil and eosinophil counts along with the total leucocyte counts and absolute lymphocyte counts, NLR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, D-dimer, ferritin and AST levels serve to predict the severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. AST appears to be a more sensitive marker than alanine aminotransferase. However, the De Ritis ratio, although not as sensitive as AST, may provide insight towards morbidity.

Importantly, we have identified a relaxation of peripheral tolerance within early antibody secreting cells that emerge in patients with COVID-19 as important drivers of those responses. While often viral-specific, these extrafollicular-derived cells also display cross reactivity to autoantigens present in the inflammatory lung environment, and despite resolution of most autoreactivity within 6 months, they persisted in some patients. These results raise questions regarding autoreactive antibodies that arise during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and their persistence in patients with symptoms in Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). Through clinical autoreactive antibody screening of 95 patients with PASC and no history of autoimmune disease, we identify significant autoreactive profiles in patients with ongoing symptoms post-recovery, with 80% of patients returning positive tests for at least one autoantigen, and 40% showing breaks in tolerance to 2 or more. Anti-nuclear antigen positivity was most common, displaying positivity in 63% of patients, however, positive tests were broad and included reactivities against carbamylated protein responses, RNA polymerase III, and phospholipids. We also identify patients with reactivity against dsDNA in the PASC cohort -- a reactivity not observed in acute infection even in the critically ill. These results demonstrate evidence of serum autoantibodies in patients who present to PASC clinics with persistent symptoms up 14 months following SARS-CoV-2 infection, and further confirm the growing linkage between COVID-19 and observed clinical autoreactivity -- even into the recovery phase of disease.","Woodruff, M.; Walker, T.; Truong, A.; Han, J.; Dixit, A.; Ramonell, R.; Runnstrom, M.; Rudoloph, M.; Khosroshahi, A.; Lee, F.

Aim We aimed to evaluate which independent parameters are associated with risk of mortality from COVID-19 in a series that includes all Italian cases, ie, more than 4 million individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Methods We analyzed factors associated with mortality using data from the Italian national database of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases, including more than 4 million cases, >415 thousand hospitalized for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and >127 thousand deceased. For patients for whom age, sex and date of infection detection were available, we determined the impact of these variables on mortality 30 days after the date of diagnosis or hospitalization. Results Multivariable Cox analysis showed that each of the analyzed variables independently affected COVID-19 mortality. Specifically, in the overall series, age was the main risk factor for mortality, with HR >100 in the age groups older than 65 years compared with a reference group of 15-44 years. Male sex presented an excess risk of death (HR = 2.1; 95% CI, 2.0-2.1). Patients infected in the first pandemic wave (before 30 June 2020) had a greater risk of death than those infected later (HR = 2.7; 95% CI, 2.7-2.8). Conclusions In a series of all confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected cases in an entire European nation, elderly age was by far the most significant risk factor for COVID-19 mortality, confirming that protecting the elderly should be a priority in pandemic management. Male sex and being infected during the first wave were additional risk factors associated with COVID-19 mortality.","Minnai, F.; De Bellis, G.; Dragani, T. A.; Colombo, F.",,294,28

By 2006, indigenous transmission of wild poliovirus (WPV) had been interrupted in all but four countries (Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan). However, outbreaks following WPV importations into previously polio-free countries remain an ongoing risk until polio is eradicated. The GPEI Strategic Plan for 2010-2012 set the following two goals for outbreak control: 1) end outbreaks occurring in 2009 by mid-2010 and 2) end outbreaks occurring during 2010 to mid-2012 within 6 months of confirmation. This report describes new outbreaks that have occurred in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region and updates previous reports on the status of outbreaks in Africa and Asia. In 2010, the first WPV importation into the European Region since the region was declared polio-free in 2002 resulted in 476 confirmed cases: 458 in Tajikistan, 14 in Russia, three in Turkmenistan, and one in Kazakhstan. In Africa and Asia, 11 new importations into six countries were observed in 2010; 30 WPV importations that occurred during 2008-2009 resulted in 215 cases in 15 African countries during 2009-2010. An outbreak is considered interrupted if 6 months have elapsed since the latest confirmed case and surveillance performance indicators meet WHO standards. All 2009 outbreaks in Africa appear to have been interrupted, and 2010 outbreaks in three countries appear to have been interrupted.

However, this would not appear to apply to all IBV strains, since one was unaffected by the drug. It would appear that some strains of IBV have the capacity to fuse with the plasma membrane at neutral pH, thereby leading to genome uncoating at that site.

Using high-preservation methods for electron microscopy, we have detected two previously unknown maturation steps in the morphogenesis of Bunyamwera virus in BHK-21 cells. The first maturation takes place inside the Golgi stack, where annular immature particles transform into dense, compact structures. Megalomicin, a drug that disrupts the trans side of the Golgi complex, reversibly blocks transformation, showing that a functional trans-Golgi is needed for maturation. The second structural change seems to take place during the egress of viral particles from cells, when a coat of round-shaped spikes becomes evident. A fourth viral assembly was detected in infected cells: rigid tubular structures assemble in the Golgi region early in infection and frequently connect with mitochondria. In Vero cells, the virus induces an early and spectacular fragmentation of intracellular membranes while productive infection progresses. Assembly occurs in fragmented Golgi stacks and generates tubular structures, as well as the three spherical viral forms. These results, together with our previous studies with nonrelated viruses, show that the Golgi complex contains key factors for the structural transformation of a number of enveloped viruses that assemble intracellularly.","Salanueva, Iñigo J; Novoa, Reyes R; Cabezas, Pilar; López-Iglesias, Carmen; Carrascosa, José L; Elliott, Richard M; Risco, Cristina",Journal of virology,294,1

The vaccine has been used under field conditions in different rearing units at the same time, mostly in the form of emergency vaccinations following the outbreak of disease. The outcome of vaccination was evaluated by recording the total numbers of piglets born alive and the piglet losses.

Methods Patients aged >18 years who were diagnosed with ACS in the emergency department were included in this study, which was planned as a cross-sectional study. Patients were divided into two groups of patients with high and low SSs according to coronary angiography results. Demographic and laboratory parameters were compared between the groups. Results Our study consisted of 78 patients diagnosed with ACS, who met the inclusion criteria. The average age of the study group was 59 years, and 67.9% of the patients were male. 21 patients (26.9%) had high SSs and 57 patients (73.1%) had low SSs. Mean IG% was significantly higher in high SS group compared to low SS group (0.71±0.25 vs 0.44±0.21 mg/dl, p<0.001). IG% can present a high SS with 76.2% sensitivity and 75.4% specificity at a cut-off value of 0.7. Conclusion IG was significantly higher in ACS patients with high SSs. It seems that IG can be used as a parameter, which is quickly accessible and cheap, in order to predict high SS in ACS patients in daily clinical practice.","Bedel, Cihan; Korkut, Mustafa; Aksoy, Fatih; Kuş, Görkem",Archives of academic emergency medicine,294,1

The factors causing exacerbation are largely unknown. This study was undertaken to determine the predominant bacterial pathogens cultured from sputum in community-based patients with AECOPD, to assess the risk factors associated with exacerbations and to compare these findings with published studies. METHODS Forty-five patients with stable COPD were prospectively followed in the outpatients' clinic of King Abdulaziz University Hospital. At the first visit, personal data, CXR and measurement of baseline PEF were obtained from each patient. In the subsequent visits, sputum culture and CXR were carried out during exacerbations. RESULTS Over a period of 24 months, patients made a total of 139 visits for exacerbations, and 69.8% had a positive sputum culture for a single pathogen. Moraxella catarrhalis (25.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.2%) and Haemophilus influenzae (11.5%) were the most common isolated organisms. Patients with a lower level of baseline PEF had a significantly increased frequency of exacerbations (r = 0.337, P = 0.024). However, there was a weak correlation between exacerbation frequency and duration of COPD and exposure to cigarette smoking. CONCLUSION There was a higher incidence of Moraxella catarrhalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than reported in previous studies. These findings should influence antibiotic selection for exacerbations. COPD patients with a low baseline PEF are at a higher risk of having repeated exacerbations and gram-negative pathogens.","Alamoudi, Omer S",Respirology,294,8

Here, we investigated the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), myeloid DCs (mDCs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and of NK cell stimulatory cytokines for the induction of an NK cell response to the protozoan parasite Leishmania infantum. In vitro, pDCs did not endocytose Leishmania promastigotes but nevertheless released interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta and interleukin (IL)-12 in a TLR9-dependent manner. mDCs rapidly internalized Leishmania and, in the presence of TLR9, produced IL-12, but not IFN-alpha/beta. Depletion of pDCs did not impair the activation of NK cells in L. infantum-infected mice. In contrast, L. infantum-induced NK cell cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production were abolished in mDC-depleted mice. The same phenotype was observed in TLR9(-/-) mice, which lacked IL-12 expression by mDCs, and in IL-12(-/-) mice, whereas IFN-alpha/beta receptor(-/-) mice showed only a minor reduction of NK cell IFN-gamma expression. This study provides the first direct evidence that mDCs are essential for eliciting NK cell cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma release in vivo and demonstrates that TLR9, mDCs, and IL-12 are functionally linked to the activation of NK cells in visceral leishmaniasis.","Schleicher, Ulrike; Liese, Jan; Knippertz, Ilka; Kurzmann, Claudia; Hesse, Andrea; Heit, Antje; Fischer, Jens A A; Weiss, Siegfried; Kalinke, Ulrich; Kunz, Stefanie; Bogdan, Christian",The Journal of experimental medicine,294,1

METHODS Children (ages 2-12) with normal tympanograms before onset of illness had bilateral tympanometry daily except weekends for 2 weeks after the onset of a cold. Nasopharyngeal secretion obtained at onset of illness was cultured for bacterial pathogens of otitis media using selective agars and tested for rhinovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, and parainfluenza 1-3 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction technology. Tympanometry was designated as abnormal with peak pressure of < or =-100 daPa or > or =50 daPa and/or a compliance peak of < 0.2 cm(3). RESULTS Eighty-six colds were studied, 82 in schoolchildren (5-12 years old) and 4 in 2- to 3-year-olds. Abnormal negative middle ear pressure occurred at least once during the 2 weeks after onset in 57 (66%) of the 86 colds. Tympanometry was abnormal in the first week after onset in 50 (88%) of the 57 colds and was abnormal on a single day in 17 (30%) of the 57. The middle ear pressure abnormalities were intermittent and shifted from one ear to the other ear from day to day. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was positive for a respiratory virus in 56 (65%) of the 86 illnesses. Rhinovirus was found in 48% and respiratory syncytial virus in 14%. Pathogenic bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis) were detected in nasopharyngeal secretion in 29 (34%) of the 86 colds; the bacteria were in high titer (> or =10(3) cfu/mL) in 26 of the 29 positive specimens. None developed illness that required a visit to a physician. Age, detection of a respiratory virus, and presence of bacterial pathogen in the nasopharyngeal secretion had a negligible effect on the occurrence of abnormal tympanometry. Occurrence of negative middle ear pressure in winter-spring colds was significantly greater than in fall colds for unexplained reasons. CONCLUSIONS Transient negative middle ear pressure occurred in two thirds of uncomplicated colds in healthy children. This negative pressure, which may facilitate secondary viral or bacterial otitis media, seems to result from viral infection of the nasopharynx and distal tube causing bilateral eustachian tube dysfunction. Tympanometry provides an objective measure of the potential beneficial effects of investigational treatments on the risk of eustachian tube dysfunction/otitis media.","Winther, Birgit; Hayden, Frederick G; Arruda, Eurico; Dutkowski, Regina; Ward, Penelope; Hendley, J Owen",Pediatrics,294,1

This study explored the knowledge, attitudes and practices among diabetics in Singapore with regard to influenza and influenza vaccination. METHODS A survey was conducted among type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus patients who attended three management centres of the Diabetic Society of Singapore in January 2007. The pilot-tested questionnaire covered influenza and influenza vaccination in terms of the patient demographics, medical history and knowledge, attitudes and practices. RESULTS A total of 307 diabetics participated in the study. Of these, 139 (45.3 percent) claimed to know the difference between influenza and the common cold, while 98 (31.9 percent) and 18 (5.9 percent) participants thought that influenza vaccines protected against all influenza strains and provided lifelong immunity, respectively. 247 (80.4 percent) participants were aware that they were at a moderate or higher risk for influenza-related complications, while 181 (58.9 percent) considered vaccination to be effective in preventing influenza and its complications. Only 94 (30.6 percent) participants were previously vaccinated. Among those unvaccinated, 117 (54.9 percent) did not think vaccination was necessary, while 104 (48.8 percent) had never considered it. As observed from the multivariate analysis, income was a key predictor of influenza vaccination. While 241 (78.5 percent) participants cited healthcare professional advice as the main guiding factor for getting vaccinated, 199 (64.8 percent) had never been advised on influenza vaccination. Of the 108 (35.1 percent) participants who had received previous advice on influenza vaccination, the majority had received it from their healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION Uptake of influenza vaccination among diabetics in Singapore is low, and the key predictor is income. Perception and knowledge are the main barriers, and hence, healthcare professionals should educate and encourage vaccination among diabetics.","Tan, E K; Lim, L H; Teoh, Y L; Ong, G; Bock, H L",Singapore medical journal,294,12

A sometimes fatal, often debilitating disease, MS features autoimmune inflammatory attack against the myelin insulation of neurons. Thymus derived (T) cells sensitized against myelin self-antigens secrete tumor necrosis factor, cytokines, prostaglandins, and other inflammatory mediators that strip away the myelin and sometimes destroy the axons. Familial and twin inheritance studies indicate MS is mildly heritable. No single MS locus has been identified, but an HLA haplotype has been implicated. Unique geographic distribution of the disease is best attributed to some combination of vitamin D abnormality and dietary patterns. No pharmaceutical or other therapies exist that confer prolonged remission on MS, and obvious interrelationships between toxic, infectious, and dietary factors make a persuasive case for integrative management. The time-proven MS diet meticulously keeps saturated fats low, includes three fish meals per week, and eliminates allergenic foods. Dietary supplementation for MS minimally requires potent vitamin supplementation, along with the thiol antioxidants, the anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids, and adaptogenic phytonutrients. Gut malabsorption and dysbiosis can be corrected using digestive enzymes and probiotics. Long-term hyperbaric oxygen therapy can slow or remit the disease. Transdermal histamine offers promise, and adenosine monophosphate may sometimes benefit. Chronic viruses and other infectious load must be aggressively treated and exercise should maintain muscle tone and balance. Early intervention with integrative modalities has the potential to make MS a truly manageable disease.","Kidd, P M",Alternative medicine review : a journal of clinical therapeutic,294,5

Novel models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) have demonstrated that T cells specific for various myelin and even nonmyelin proteins are potentially encephalitogenic. The encephalitogenic T cell response directed against different CNS antigens not only determines the lesional topography of CNS inflammation but also the composition of the inflammatory infiltrates. The heterogeneity of the lesional distribution seen in EAE might therefore be useful for the understanding of the various clinical subtypes seen in MS. In this review the possible candidate autoantigens in MS are discussed with special regard to the human T cell and B cell responses against various myelin and nonmyelin proteins.,"Schmidt, S",Multiple sclerosis,294,16

The murine susceptibility is noteworthy in that it persists beyond the development of resistance to other, nonfungal pathogens and the maturation of most immune functions. As the susceptibility to blastomycosis appeared to be related to an early event after infection, primary effector cell function was studied. We found that peritoneal inflammatory cells, enriched for neutrophils, from immature (3-week-old) mice killed nonphagocytizable Blastomyces dermatitidis cells less (25%) than did cells from mature (8-week) mice (70%) (P<0.01), a defect intrinsic to the neutrophils. This correlated with an impaired immature cell oxidative burst. Killing of phagocytizable Candida albicans was not significantly different, 73 versus 87%. Thioglycolate-elicited cells were more impaired; killing of B. dermatitidis was insignificant, and killing of C. albicans was more impaired in immature (16% killing) than in mature (45%) cells (P<0.02). Peripheral blood neutrophils from mature animals killed B. dermatitidis (41%) more than did those from immature animals (10%) (P<0.02); C. albicans was killed efficiently by both. Resting or activated peritoneal macrophages from both types of animals showed no differences in B. dermatitidis killing. These results suggest that the susceptibility of immature mice is related at least in part to the depressed capacity of their neutrophils to kill B. dermatitidis.","Ganer, A; Brummer, E; Stevens, D A",Infection and immunity,294,28

Innovative interventions such as 'serious games' have been proposed in other areas to educate and help clinicians adopt optimal behaviours. There is limited evidence about the application and evaluation of serious games in IPC. The purposes of the study were: a) to synthesise research evidence on the use of serious games in IPC to support healthcare workers' behaviour change and best practice learning; and b) to identify gaps across the formulation and evaluation of serious games in IPC. METHODS A scoping study was conducted using the methodological framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley. We interrogated electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase Classic + Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, Cochrane, Google Scholar) in December 2015. Evidence from these studies was assessed against an analytic framework of intervention formulation and evaluation. RESULTS Nine hundred sixty five unique papers were initially identified, 23 included for full-text review, and four finally selected. Studies focused on intervention inception and development rather than implementation. Expert involvement in game design was reported in 2/4 studies. Potential game users were not included in needs assessment and game development. Outcome variables such as fidelity or sustainability were scarcely reported. CONCLUSIONS The growing interest in serious games for health has not been coupled with adequate evaluation of processes, outcomes and contexts involved. Explanations about the mechanisms by which game components may facilitate behaviour change are lacking, further hindering adoption.","Castro-Sánchez, Enrique; Kyratsis, Yiannis; Iwami, Michiyo; Rawson, Timothy M; Holmes, Alison H",Antimicrobial resistance and infection control,294,20

Immunocompromised patients, including HIV-infected individuals, are at increased risk for NI, and 15-18.3% of them are represented by lower respiratory tract infections. Nosocomial pulmonary infections (NPI) appear to be more common in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), as a result of the degree of immunosuppression, prior use of antibiotics, and exposure to invasive procedures. RECENT FINDINGS This article reviews the epidemiologic and clinical evidences and reports on the occurrence of NPI in HIV-infected inpatients. SUMMARY Although underestimated, NI occur commonly in HIV-infected patients, and among them nosocomial pneumonia, including tuberculosis and bacterial pneumonia, are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The improvement of antiretroviral therapeutic options in developed countries has resulted in a decreased hospitalization rate of HIV-infected individuals. Healthcare delivery in the in- and outpatient setting represents a potential for infections, including lower respiratory tract ones, according to the degree of immunosuppression and the intensity of invasive procedures. To minimize the risk of acquisition of healthcare associated low respiratory tract infections, adherence of healthcare workers to common infection practices, specific respiratory precautions, and early identification of persons who have tuberculosis or are at high risk for active tuberculosis, should be strengthened.","Petrosillo, Nicola; Nicastri, Emanuele; Viale, Pierluigi",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,294,1

Complementary DNA was male double stranded and cloned into the pUC9 plasmid. Approximately 200 complementary DNA clones varying in length from 0.5 to 2.5 kilobases were obtained. Hybridization assays indicated that the sequences isolated were specific for bovine viral diarrhea virus and that at least 5.5 kilobases of bovine viral diarrhea virus genome was represented in the library of complementary DNA clones, the majority of which may have originated from the 3' end of the virus genome. One cloned complementary DNA sequence was used as a 32P-labelled hybridization probe for bovine viral diarrhea virus detection. The probe hybridized with all cytopathic and noncytopathic strains of bovine viral diarrhea virus tested and was 100 times more sensitive than infectivity assays for the detection of bovine viral diarrhea virus. Hybridization did not occur with nucleic acids from bovine coronavirus, bluetongue virus, bovine adenovirus or uninfected cell cultures. Native plasmid DNA sequences, labelled with 32P, did not hybridize with bovine viral diarrhea virus ribonucleic acid.","Brock, K V; Brian, D A; Rouse, B T; Potgieter, L N",Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,294,17

The N-terminal part of this cellular receptor (soR) is sufficient for S binding and for subsequent induction of the conformational changes required for virus-cell membrane fusion. Here we analyzed whether these characteristics can be used to redirect MHV to human cancer cells. To this end, the soR domain was coupled to single-chain monoclonal antibody 425, which is directed against the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), resulting in a bispecific adapter protein (soR-425). The soR and soR-425 proteins, both produced with the vaccinia virus system, were able to neutralize MHV infection of murine LR7 cells. However, only soR-425 was able to target MHV to human EGFR-expressing cancer cells. Interestingly, the targeted infections induced syncytium formation. Furthermore, the soR-425-mediated infections were blocked by heptad repeat-mimicking peptides, indicating that virus entry requires the regular S protein fusion process. We conclude that the specific spike-binding property of the CEACAM1a N-terminal fragment can be exploited to direct the virus to selected cells by linking it to a moiety able to bind a receptor on those cells. This approach might be useful in the development of tumor-targeted coronaviruses.","Würdinger, T; Verheije, M H; Broen, K; Bosch, B J; Haijema, B J; de Haan, C A M; van Beusechem, V W; Gerritsen, W R; Rottier, P J M",Journal of virology,294,1

The critical relationship between the health sector and other sectors is not well understood and addressed. Hospitals depend on critical infrastructure external to the organisation itself. Existing plans do not adequately consider the complexity and interdependency of systems upon which hospitals rely. The failure of one such system can trigger a failure of another, causing cascading breakdowns. Health is only one of the many systems that struggle at maximum capacity during ""normal"" times, as current business models operate with no or minimal ""excess"" staff and have become irreducible operations.

METHODS Nasal swabs and blood samples were collected from 45 foals or horses from five separate outbreaks of respiratory disease that occurred in New Zealand in 1996, and from 37 yearlings at the time of the annual yearling sales in January that same year. Virus isolation from nasal swabs and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) was undertaken and serum samples were tested for antibodies against equine herpesviruses (EHV-1, EHV-2, EHV-4 and EHV-5), equine rhinitis-A virus (ERAV), equine rhinitis-B virus (ERBV), equine adenovirus 1 (EAdV-1), equine arteritis virus (EAV), reovirus 3 and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3). RESULTS Viruses were isolated from 24/94 (26%) nasal swab samples and from 77/80 (96%) PBL samples collected from both healthy horses and horses showing clinical signs of respiratory disease. All isolates were identified as EHV-2, EHV-4, EHV-5 or untyped EHV. Of the horses and foals tested, 59/82 (72%) were positive for EHV-1 and/or EHV-4 serum neutralising (SN) antibody on at least one sampling occasion, 52/82 (63%) for EHV-1-specific antibody tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 10/80 (13%) for ERAV SN antibody, 60/80 (75%) for ERBV SN antibody, and 42/80 (53%) for haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody to EAdV-1. None of the 64 serum samples tested were positive for antibodies to EAV, reovirus 3 or PIV3. Evidence of infection with all viruses tested was detected in both healthy horses and in horses showing clinical signs of respiratory disease. Recent EHV-2 infection was associated with the development of signs of respiratory disease among yearlings [relative risk (RR)=2.67, 95% CI=1.59-4.47, p=0.017]. CONCLUSIONS Of the equine respiratory viruses detected in horses in New Zealand during this study, EHV-2 was most likely to be associated with respiratory disease. However, factors other than viral infection are probably important in the development of clinical signs of disease.","Dunowska, M; Wilks, C R; Studdert, M J; Meers, J",New Zealand veterinary journal,294,33

Although several studies have measured B. microti antibodies in blood donors, little is known about associated parasitemia and the inherent risk of transmitting the parasite by transfusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Donations from blood donors located in Babesia-endemic and nonendemic areas of Connecticut were tested for B. microti antibodies from July through September. Subsequently, an additional blood sample was collected from selected seropositive donors and tested by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for B. microti nucleic acids. RESULTS A total of 3490 donations, 1745 each from endemic and nonendemic areas, were tested for B. microti antibodies; 30 (0.9%) were confirmed as positive and seroprevalence rates peaked in July. Significantly more seropositive donations were from endemic areas (24, 1.4%) than nonendemic areas (6, 0.3%). Ten (53%) of 19 seropositive donors subsequently tested by PCR were positive. CONCLUSION B. microti seroprevalence was highest in those areas of Connecticut where the parasite is endemic. More than half of seropositive donors tested had demonstrable parasitemia, indicating that many are at risk for transmitting B. microti by blood transfusion. Three donors were identified as parasitemic in October, suggesting that donors may be at risk for transmitting the parasite outside of the peak period of community-acquired infection.","Leiby, David A; Chung, Amy P S; Gill, Jennifer E; Houghton, Raymond L; Persing, David H; Badon, Stanley; Cable, Ritchard G",Transfusion,294,9

Deletion analysis revealed that the sequence encoding the C terminus of the 100K polypeptide lies close to nucleotide 15120; it may therefore be generated by proteolysis at a potential QS cleavage site encoded by nucleotides 15129 to 15135. In contrast, expression of IBV sequences from nucleotides 10752 to 16980 generated two polypeptides of approximately 62 and 235 kDa, which represent the ORF 1a stop product and the 1a-1b fused product generated by a frameshifting mechanism, respectively, but no processed products were observed. Since the putative picornavirus 3C-like proteinase domain is located in ORF 1a between nucleotides 8937 and 9357, this observation suggests that deletion of the picornavirus 3C-like proteinase domain and surrounding regions abolishes processing of the 1b polyprotein. In addition, the in vitro translation and in vivo transfection studies also indicate that the ORF 1a region between nucleotides 8763 and 10720 contains elements that down-regulate the expression of ORF 1b.","Liu, D X; Brierley, I; Tibbles, K W; Brown, T D",Journal of virology,294,1

This study describes a sensitive and specific real-time RT-PCR method for the detection of influenza A subtype H5 and for monitoring virus loads. Using serial dilutions of influenza A H5N1 cultures, this assay reproducibly determined the lowest detection limit to be approximately 5 x 10(-2) 50 % egg infective doses (EID(50)). In contrast, the minimum detection limit was approximately 3 EID(50) in conventional RT-PCR with WHO primers and 10 EID(50) in antigen-capture ELISA. In tests of serial dilutions of in vitro-transcribed influenza A H5 gene RNA, there was linear amplification from 40 copies to 4 x 10(8) copies of target RNA per reaction and approximately six copies, and sometimes even as few as three copies, of target RNA tested positive in our assay. Thirty-five throat swabs from ill birds were tested: 33 samples tested positive using this assay. In comparison, 27, 13 and 19 samples tested positive using conventional RT-PCR, antigen-capture ELISA and virus isolation, respectively. To evaluate further the sensitivity of this real-time RT-PCR, a standard panel and 60 H5N1 isolates that contained different clades of influenza virus A/H5N1 were tested and all tested positive. To evaluate the specificity of the assay, 60 throat swabs from patients infected with influenza virus A H1 were tested; all were negative. Thirteen other viruses were also tested and all tested negative.","Chen, Weijun; He, Bo; Li, Changgui; Zhang, Xiaowei; Wu, Weili; Yin, Xuyang; Fan, Baoxing; Fan, Xingliang; Wang, Jian",Journal of medical microbiology,294,11

We determined to reduce length of stay and admissions in patients presenting with symptoms of possible myocardial infarction; the most common presentation group. After establishing stakeholder consensus, the existing accelerated diagnostic pathway (ADP) based on the ED Assessment of Chest-pain Score (EDACS), electrocardiogram, and troponin measurements with a high-sensitivity assay (hs-cTn) on presentation and two hours later (EDACS-ADP) was modified to stream patients following an initial troponin measure as follows: (i) to a very-low risk group who could be discharged home without follow-up or further testing, and (ii) to a low-risk group who could be discharged with next-day follow-up community troponin testing. Simulations were run in an extensive research database to determine appropriate hs-cTnI and EDACS thresholds for risk classification. This COVID-ADP was developed in ~2-weeks and was implemented in the ED within a further 3-weeks. A comparison of all chest pain presentations for the 3 months prior to implementation of the COVID-ADP to 3 months following implementation showed that there was a 64.7% increase in patients having only one troponin test in the ED, a 30-minute reduction of mean length of stay of people discharged home from the ED, and a 24.3% reduction in hospital admissions of patients ultimately diagnosed with non-cardiac chest pain.","Than, Martin P; Pickering, John W; Adamson, Philip; Clendon, Thomas; Florkowski, Christopher M; Lainchbury, John; Loubser, Jacques; Nankivel, Alison; Aldous, Sally J",EJIFCC,294,1

Our AI prognosis system, trained using data from 3,661 patients, achieves an AUC of 0.786 (95% CI: 0.742-0.827) when predicting deterioration within 96 hours. The deep neural network extracts informative areas of chest X-ray images to assist clinicians in interpreting the predictions, and performs comparably to two radiologists in a reader study. In order to verify performance in a real clinical setting, we silently deployed a preliminary version of the deep neural network at NYU Langone Health during the first wave of the pandemic, which produced accurate predictions in real-time.

These findings led us to use a new lightweight monofilament polyester mesh (Parietex TCM, Covidien). Here, we report our experience with this mesh in open incisional hernia repair. METHODS Patients undergoing incisional hernia repair with Parietex TCM were retrospectively identified within our prospectively maintained database. Patient demographics,operative characteristics, and follow-up were reviewed. Outcome parameters included 90-day wound morbidity and hernia recurrence. RESULTS In 2011, 36 patients (mean age 56.8; mean BMI32.4 kg/m2) underwent open incisional hernia repair with retrorectus mesh placement by two surgeons (MJR, YWN) at Case Medical Center. Anterior and posterior fascial closure was achieved in all cases. Wound morbidity included seven surgical site occurrences: four superficial infections that resolved with antibiotics, one wound dehiscence requiring wet-to-dry packing, and two seromas that resolved without intervention. With a mean follow-up of 13 months, 8 (22%) recurrences have occurred. On reoperation, 7 (19%) of these patients had mechanical failure or fracturing of the mesh. No confounding variables were identified by univariate analysis of patient demographics,operative characteristics, or wound morbidity. CONCLUSION Lightweight monofilament polyester mesh (Parietex TCM) appears to have a high incidence of mechanical failure in the context of open incisional hernia repair. While this limitation may ultimately be revealed asa weakness of all lightweight mesh, surgeons should be aware that these failures have already been documented.","Petro, C C; Nahabet, E H; Criss, C N; Orenstein, S B; von Recum, H A; Novitsky, Y W; Rosen, M J",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,294,8

Therefore, inhibition (anti-inflammatory) property of tocotrienols at low doses is useful for cardiovascular disease, whereas, activation (pro-inflammatory) property using high dose is found effective for treatments of various types of cancer. We have recently described plasma bioavailability of 125 mg/d, 250 mg/d and 500 mg/d doses of δ-tocotrienol in healthy fed subjects, which showed dose-dependent increases in area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax). Hence, in the current study, higher doses of tocotrienols have used to analyze its effect on plasma pharmacokinetic parameters. AIMS To evaluate the safety and bioavailability of higher doses (750 mg and 1000 mg) of annatto-based tocotrienols in healthy fed subjects. All four isomers (α-, β-, γ-, δ-) of tocols (tocotrienols and tocopherols) present in the plasmas of subjects were quantified and analyzed for various pharmacokinetic parameters. STUDY DESIGN An open-label, randomized study was performed to analyze pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of δ-tocotrienol in 6 healthy fed subjects. All subjects (3/dose) were randomly assigned to one of each dose of 750 mg or 1000 mg. Blood samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 h intervals and all isomers of α-,β-,γ-,δ-tocotrienols, and tocopherols in plasmas were quantified by HPLC. RESULTS Oral administration of 750 and 1000 mg/d of tocotrienols resulted in dose-dependent increases in plasmas (ng/ml) AUCt0-t8 6621, 7450; AUCt0-∞ 8688, 9633; AUMC t0-∞ 52497, 57199; MRT 6.04, 5.93; Cmax 1444, 1592 (P<0.05), respectively, of δ-tocotrienol isomer. Moreover, both doses also resulted in plasmas Tmax 3.33-4 h; elimination half-life (t1/2 h) 2.74, 2.68; time of clearance (Cl-T, l/h) 0.086, 0.078; volume of distribution (Vd/f, mg/h) 0.34, 0.30; and elimination rate constant (ke; h-1) 0.25, 0.17, respectively of δ- tocotrienol isomer. Similar results of these parameters were reported for γ-tocotrienol, β- tocotrienol, α-tocotrienol, δ-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, and β-tocopherol, except for α- tocopherol. CONCLUSIONS This study has described pharmacokinetics using higher doses of 750 mg/d and 1000 mg/d of δ-tocotrienol. These results confirmed earlier findings that Tmax was 3-4 h for all isomers of tocotrienols and tocopherols except for α-tocopherol (6 h). These higher doses of tocotrienols were found safe in humans and may be useful for treatments of various types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease.","Qureshi, Asaf A; Khan, Dilshad A; Silswal, Neerupma; Saleem, Shahid; Qureshi, Nilofer",Journal of clinical & experimental cardiology,294,1

One hundred percent of wolves developed and maintained a positive titer to CDV for 3 yr and 96.9% of wolves developed and maintained a positive titer to CPV for 3 yr. Seroconversion for canine adenovirus was sporadic. The results of this study support decreasing the frequency of vaccine administration in the red wolf population to a triennial basis.","Anderson, Kadie; Case, Allison; Woodie, Kathleen; Waddell, William; Reed, Holly H",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,294,10

Between 1990 and 1993, the dynamics of 10 wild dog packs in the southern district of the Kruger National Park in South Africa were monitored. Casual observations of the causes of disease and mortality in the entire population were also recorded. During the same period, 46 wild dogs were immobilised, weighed, and subjected to physical examination as well as the collection of blood and faecal specimens. External parasites were collected and blood smears were prepared. Serum specimens were subjected to routine blood chemistry analyses, hormone and serological assays and formalinised blood specimens and faeces were subjected to screening for endoparasites. The study population varied from 75 in 1990 to 123 in 1993 with a survival rate of 29.9% for pups, 64.3% for yearlings and 69% for adults. Eighty per cent or more of the population were under 4 years of age. The cause of death in all wild dogs in the Kruger National Park could be established only in a small number of cases. Lions were responsible for the death of 20/62 wild dogs and disease caused the death of 6/62 wild dogs. All immobilised dogs were in a good physical condition, but 85% of dogs had one or more skin lesions. Potential life-threatening lesions (bitewounds inflicted by other dogs and lesions inflicted by a snare) occurred in 4 dogs. One male dog had only one testicle in the scortum. Twenty-six (93%) blood smears were positive for gametocytes of Hepatozoon sp., presumably H. canis, and in 2 dogs trophozoites of Babesia canis were seen.

METHODS Children were recruited prospectively from the emergency department of the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne during peak RSV season in 1998. Information was collected regarding past and current asthma presentations, a nasopharyngeal asprirate was taken for viral isolation and all children were reviewed by telephone 1 week following presentation. RESULTS 73 children were included with a median age of 28 months. RSV was isolated from 33 (45%) of children, one child had adenovirus and in the remainder no virus was isolated. Children less than 12 months were more likely to have RSV (70%). RSV-positive children had a longer duration of illness prior to hospital presentation than RSV-negative children but were not more likely to be admitted or to have a longer duration of ongoing symptoms. CONCLUSION A high rate of RSV infection was demonstrated in young children with recurrent wheeze or asthma during the RSV season. This information has important implications for the control of nosocomial infection with RSV (i.e. isolation of patients) and in targeting another group to be included for RSV vaccine development.","Lazzaro, Teresa; Hogg, Geoff; Barnett, Peter",Journal of paediatrics and child health,294,12

The MAbs were specific for antigenic sites A, B and D of the haemagglutinin. Activities of the IgGs varied by up to 6-fold on a molar basis, apart from the HI activity of HC58 which was > 100-fold lower. This was not due to low functional affinity as HC58 had the second highest value (nM) as determined by an equilibrium method with whole virions. Conversion to the F(ab')2 reduced neutralization and HI by only 2- to 6-fold, indicating that the Fc region had little involvement in these processes. However, all Fabs had low neutralization and HI activity compared with their IgGs, neutralization being reduced by 86 to > 1912-fold, and HI by 13 to > 69-fold. Although decreased, their affinities remained high, in the nM range. Neutralization and HI by three of the Fabs (HC2, HC3W and HC61) were restored by the addition of anti-Fab IgG; however, HC10 Fab+anti-Fab IgG still had no detectable neutralization activity but gave HI, and HC58 Fab+anti-Fab IgG had no detectable HI activity but neutralized to the same extent as its IgG. The different properties of the antibodies are discussed in the light of their known mechanisms of action: HI by steric blocking of attachment of virus to the red cell receptor, and neutralization by the inhibition of post-attachment events (HC2, HC10 and HC61). The data demonstrate just how variable are the antiviral properties of individual IgGs.","Schofield, D J; Stephenson, J R; Dimmock, N J",The Journal of general virology,294,16

Analysis of the cDNA revealed that the S protein consists of 1376 amino acids, as does the S protein of mouse hepatitis virus 4. We inserted the cDNA into the genome of vaccinia virus to obtain a recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV). The S protein expressed in RK13 cells infected by the rVV was shown to be electrophoretically and immunologically indistinguishable from the S protein produced in DBT cells infected with cl-2 virus. RVV infection of rats and mice induced S protein-specific antibody production detectable by immunofluorescence and neutralization. Moreover, the S protein expressed by the rVV induced syncytium formation not only in mouse DBT and L cells, which are susceptible to cl-2 virus infection, but also in rabbit RK13 cells, which are not susceptible to cl-2 virus infection. This result suggests the possibility that RK13 cells have binding sites for the cl-2 virus S protein.","Taguchi, F; Ikeda, T; Shida, H",The Journal of general virology,294,19

Faecal samples were collected on alternate days and screened for the presence of rotaviruses, bovine coronavirus, Cryptosporidium oocysts, K99 positive strains of E. coli and Salmonella spp. Rotaviruses and Cryptosporidium were the most commonly detected agents (78% and 60% respectively of the calves). Bovine coronavirus was detected in the faeces of 18% of the calves, whilst K99 positive E. coli was only found in 2 samples from one calf. Salmonella spp. were not isolated from any of the 646 faecal samples examined. Shedding of rotaviruses occurred in a bimodal pattern beginning in the first week of the survey. Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected most frequently in the interval between the two peaks of rotavirus shedding. The presence of rotaviruses or Cryptosporidium oocysts in faeces was not strongly associated with scour, nor were combined infections with these agents or the cases of bovine coronavirus infection.

They were compared with commonly used vaccine strains, including 793/B, D274, and Massachusetts types. Reverse transcription-PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism, nucleotide sequencing, and GenBank BLAST database analyses of the hypervariable region of the S1 subunit of the virus spike gene showed that the three isolates, designated TN20/00, TN200/01, and TN335/01, share from 64% to 82% homologies between each other but are very different from the H120 strain, the only infectious bronchitis vaccine used in Tunisia. In addition, they showed from 57% to 78% similarities with the European genotypes, including D274 and 793/B. Phylogenetic data allowed classification of the three Tunisian isolates as new genotypes placed inside the same genetic group as the CR88121 and D274 genotypes but very distant from the Massachusetts genotype. Cross-virus neutralization tests confirmed the genotyping results and showed that both TN200/01 and TN335/01 isolates are serologically related, whereas the TN20/00 is closer to TN335/01 than to TN200/01. Moreover, all three Tunisian isolates are closely related to the European variant serotypes, including the CR88121 and the D274 strains, but none is serologically related to the H120 vaccine strain. These data demonstrated, for the first time in Tunisia, the cocirculation of IBV variant serotypes along with the Massachusetts type, causing severe clinical diseases and high economic losses to the poultry industry.","Bourogâa, Hager; Miled, Khaled; Gribâa, Latifa; El Behi, Imen; Ghram, Abdeljelil",Avian diseases,294,19

It is a new disease and researchers are trying to explore its clinical presentation and outcome to know more about the course of the disease. The objective of the present study was to determine the clinical and laboratory characteristics of Coronavirus disease-19 associated with severity of the disease. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted at Rehman Medical Institute, Peshawar from April to August 2020. All patients presented to the hospital and were diagnosed as COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Disease characteristics and clinical outcomes were noted in both mild and severe cases. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the disease severity and a comparison was made between these groups in terms of demographics, lab parameters and outcomes. Data were analysed by using SPSS version 24. Results Out of 227 patients, 80.2% (n=182) were males while 19.8% (n=45) were females. The mean age of the patients was 54.44±14.35 yrs. 61.2% (n=139) had co-morbidities with diabetes being the most common. 26.9% (n=61) had severe disease and 18.1% (n=41) died.20.7% (n=47) had lymphopenia, 48.45% (n=110) had leucocytosis and thrombocytopenia was seen in 11.89% (n=27). CRP, D-dimers, ferritin and LDH were raised in 83.25% (n=189), 80.17% (n=182), 81.05% (n=184), 77.09% (n=175) of the patients respectively. Comparing our designated patient groups revealed that old age, comorbidities, leucocytosis, lymphopenia, raised inflammatory markers were associated with severe disease and that mortality was high in the severe disease group. Conclusion Middle-aged males with comorbidities were the most affected subset of patients. Disease severity was associated with old age, comorbidities and certain lab abnormalities. The outcome was poor in case of severe disease. However, no gender correlation was found with disease severity.","Qayyum, Wajeeha; Khan, Shaheen Ali; Saeed, Laraib; Jawad, Mohammad; Khan, Muhammad Fozan; Ullah, Ihsan","Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC",294,8

ANIMALS 8 healthy Coonhound-cross dogs (mean ± SD weight, 27.2 ± 1.6 kg). PROCEDURES Thoracic CT of each dog was performed before placement of a TT and daily thereafter for 7 days. Thoracic fluid volume was calculated from CT images. Effusion was aspirated when detected; volume was recorded, and cytologic analysis and bacterial culture were performed. RESULTS Mean ± SD volume of pleural effusion detected by CT was 1.43 ± 0.59 mL/kg (range, 0.12 to 3.32 mL/kg). Mean volume collected via aspiration was 0.48 ± 0.84 mL/kg (range, 0 to 2.16 mL/kg). Cytologic analysis yielded results consistent with an exudate, characterized by septic suppurative inflammation in 6 dogs and mixed inflammation in 1 dog; there was insufficient volume for analysis in 1 dog. Sufficient volume was obtained for bacterial culture for 6 dogs, which yielded pure growths of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (n = 3) and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus (2) and mixed growth of both of these species (1). The TT was removed before day 7 in 4 dogs because of pyothorax (n = 3) and irreversible damage to the TT (1). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Presence of a TT induced a minimal volume of pleural effusion in healthy dogs. Pyothorax developed in most dogs between 4 and 6 days after TT placement. On the basis of these findings, a TT should be removed by the fourth day after placement, unless complications are detected sooner.","Hung, Germaine C; Gaunt, M Casey; Rubin, Joseph E; Starrak, Gregory S; Sakals, Sherisse A",American journal of veterinary research,294,5

Remarkably, a fraction of non-structural protein 1 (nsp1), a protein essential for transcription but dispensable for genome replication, is present in the host cell nucleus, in particular during the earlier stages of infection. Expression of GFP-tagged fusion proteins revealed that nsp1 is actively imported into the nucleus. Although the signals responsible for nsp1 transport could not be identified, our studies revealed that another EAV protein with a partially nuclear localization, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, utilizes the CRM1-mediated nuclear export pathway. Inactivation of this pathway with the drug leptomycin B resulted in the unexpected and immediate nuclear retention of all N protein molecules, thus revealing that the protein shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus before playing its role in cytoplasmic virus assembly.","Tijms, Marieke A; van der Meer, Yvonne; Snijder, Eric J",The Journal of general virology,294,9

To update data on state cigarette excise taxes in 2009, CDC conducted a survey of changes in state cigarette excise taxes during 2010-2011. During that period, eight states increased their cigarette excise taxes, and one state decreased its tax; as a result, the mean state tax increased from $1.34 in 2009 to $1.46 in 2011.

In the absence of vaccines and antivirals, several behavioural change and policy initiatives, such as physical distancing, have been implemented to control the spread of the coronavirus. Social media data can reveal public perceptions toward how governments and health agencies across the globe are handling the pandemic, as well as the impact of the disease on people regardless of their geographic locations in line with various factors that hinder or facilitate the efforts to control the spread of the pandemic globally. This paper aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people globally using social media data. We apply natural language processing (NLP) and thematic analysis to understand public opinions, experiences, and issues with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic using social media data. First, we collect over 47 million COVID-19-related comments from Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and three online discussion forums. Second, we perform data preprocessing which involves applying NLP techniques to clean and prepare the data for automated theme extraction. Third, we apply context-aware NLP approach to extract meaningful keyphrases or themes from over 1 million randomly selected comments, as well as compute sentiment scores for each theme and assign sentiment polarity based on the scores using lexicon-based technique. Fourth, we categorize related themes into broader themes. A total of 34 negative themes emerged, out of which 15 are health-related issues, psychosocial issues, and social issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic from the public perspective. In addition, 20 positive themes emerged from our results. Finally, we recommend interventions that can help address the negative issues based on the positive themes and other remedial ideas rooted in research.","Oyebode, Oladapo; Ndulue, Chinenye; Adib, Ashfaq; Mulchandani, Dinesh; Suruliraj, Banuchitra; Orji, Fidelia Anulika; Chambers, Christine; Meier, Sandra; Orji, Rita",,294,32

Methods: To explore the potential cis-acting control elements involved in the transcriptional regulation of the HLA-DPA1/DPB1 gene, we performed the expression analysis using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based transgenic humanized mice in the C57BL/6 background, which carried the entire HLA-DP401 gene locus. We further developed a mouse model of Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia in HLA-DP401 humanized transgenic mice, and performed the analysis on the expression pattern of HLA-DP401 and immunological responses in the model. Results: In this study, we screened and identified a BAC clone spanning the entire HLA-DP gene locus. DNA from this clone was analyzed for integrity by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and then microinjected into fertilized mouse oocytes to produce transgenic founder animals. Nine sets of PCR primers for regional markers with an average distance of 15 kb between each primer were used to confirm the integrity of the transgene in the five transgenic lines carrying the HLA-DPA1/DPB1 gene. Transgene copy numbers were determined by real-time PCR analysis. HLA-DP401 gene expression was analyzed at the mRNA and protein level. Although infection with S aureus Newman did not alter the percentage of immune cells in the spleen and thymus from the HLA-DP401-H2-Aß1 humanized mice. Increased expression of HLA-DP401 was observed in the thymus of the humanized mice infected by S aureus. Conclusions: We generated several BAC transgenic mice, and analyzed the expression of HLA-DPA1/DPB1 in those mice. A model of S aureus-induced pneumonia in the HLA-DP401-H2-Aß1-/- humanized mice was further developed, and S aureus infection upregulated the HLA-DP401 expression in thymus of those humanized mice. These findings demonstrate the potential of those HLA-DPA1/DPB1 transgenic humanized mice for developing animal models of infectious diseases and MHC-associated immunological diseases.","Li, Feng; Zhu, Meng-Min; Niu, Bo-Wen; Liu, Ling-Ling; Peng, Xiu-Hua; Yang, Hua; Qin, Bo-Yin; Wang, Meixiang; Ren, Xiaonan; Zhou, Xiaohui",Animal Model Exp Med,294,21

Nevertheless, there is a paucity of research on the COVID-19 impact on people with dementia and their care partners. OBJECTIVE: Using Twitter, the purpose of this study is to understand the experiences of COVID-19 for people with dementia and their care partners. METHODS: We collected tweets on COVID-19 and dementia using the GetOldTweets application in Python from February 15 to September 7, 2020. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the tweets. RESULTS: From the 5063 tweets analyzed with line-by-line coding, we identified 4 main themes including (1) separation and loss; (2) COVID-19 confusion, despair, and abandonment; (3) stress and exhaustion exacerbation; and (4) unpaid sacrifices by formal care providers. CONCLUSIONS: There is an imminent need for governments to rethink using a one-size-fits-all response to COVID-19 policy and use a collaborative approach to support people with dementia.

We investigated the role of tocilizumab (TCZ) on interleukin-6 (IL-6) trends and MV in patients with SARS-CoV-2. In this longitudinal observational study, 112 patients were evaluated from 1 February to 31 May 2020. TCZ was administered followed by methylprednisolone to patients with >3L oxygen requirement and pneumonia severity index score &#8804;130 with computed tomography scan changes. IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and procalcitonin were monitored on days 0, 3, and 6 of therapy. Statistical analyses were performed with significance &#8804;0.05. Eighty out of 112 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (45 males, 56.96%; 34 females, 43.04%) were included in this study. Seven patients expired (8.75%) and nine patients required MV (11.25%). Median IL-6 levels pre-administration of TCZ was 342.50 (78.25-666.25) pg/mL compared with post-administration on day 3 (563; 162-783) pg/mL (P < .00001). On day 6, the median dropped to 545 (333.50-678.50) pg/mL compared with day 3 (P = .709). CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D-dimer levels were reduced after TCZ therapy. Early use of TCZ may reduce the need for MV and decrease CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D-dimer levels. The sequential use of methylprednisolone for 72 hours seems to potentiate the effect and prolong the suppression of the cytokine storm. IL-6 levels may be helpful as a prognostic tool.","Antony, Suresh J; Davis, Michelle A; Davis, Monique G; Almaghlouth, Nouf K; Guevara, Roberto; Omar, Fahad; Del Rey, Fernando; Hassan, Ali; Arian, Muhammad U; Antony, Nishaal; Prakash, Bharat V",J. med. virol,294,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 and positive swab-test undergoing to a chest CT on third-generation DSCT were included. The imaging protocol included a dual-energy acquisition (HD-DECT, 90/150Sn kVp) and fast, low-dose, long-pitch CT, dual-source scan at 100Sn kVp (LDCT). Subjective (Likert Scales) and objective (signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios, SNR and CNR) analyses were performed; radiation dose and acquisition times were recorded. Nonparametric tests were used. RESULTS: The median radiation dose was lower for LDCT than HD-DECT (Effective dose, ED: 0.28 mSv vs. 3.28 mSv, p = 0.016). LDCT had median acquisition time of 0.62 s (vs 2.02 s, p = 0.016). SNR and CNR were significantly different in several thoracic structures between HD-DECT and LDCT, with exception of lung parenchyma.

Taking inspiration from real data of the Covid-19, for the case of cumulative confirmed positives and deaths, we propose an exponentially decaying transmission rate with two free parameters, one for its initial amplitude and another one for its decaying rate. The resultant time-dependent SI model, which under extra conditions recovers the standard Gompertz functional form, is then compared with data from selected countries and its parameters fit using Bayesian inference.

We used Standardized Mean Differences (SMD) to build forest plots of continuous data and assess differences in serum D-dimer concentrations between severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19 disease. We evaluated p-value < 0.05 as statistically significant and preferred 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Result: The pooled results of all studies revealed that the D-dimer concentrations were significantly higher in patients with more severe COVID-19 (SMD: 2.32 µg/mL; 95% CI, 0.72 3.92 µg/mL, p< 0.001).

No specific antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of COVID-19 till date. Drug repurposing strategy helps to find out the drugs for COVID-19 treatment from existing FDA approved antiviral drugs. In this study, FDA approved small molecule antiviral drugs were repurposed against the major viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: The 3D structures of FDA approved small molecule antiviral drugs were retrieved from PubChem. Virtual screening was performed to find out the lead antiviral drug molecules against main protease (Mpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) using COVID-19 Docking Server. Furthermore, lead molecules were individually docked against protein targets using AutoDock 4.0.1 software and their drug-likeness and ADMET properties were evaluated. RESULTS: Out of 65 FDA approved small molecule antiviral drugs screened, Raltegravir showed highest interaction energy value of -9 kcal/mol against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 and Indinavir, Tipranavir, and Pibrentasvir exhibited a binding energy value of &#8805;-8 kcal/mol. Similarly Indinavir showed the highest binding energy of -11.5 kcal/mol against the target protein RdRp and Dolutegravir, Elbasvir, Tipranavir, Taltegravir, Grazoprevir, Daclatasvir, Glecaprevir, Ledipasvir, Pibrentasvir and Velpatasvir showed a binding energy value in range from -8 to -11.2 kcal/mol. The antiviral drugs Raltegravir, Indinavir, Tipranavir, Dolutegravir, and Etravirine also exhibited good bioavailability and drug-likeness properties. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the screened small molecule antiviral drugs Raltegravir, Indinavir, Tipranavir, Dolutegravir, and Etravirine could serve as potential drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 with further validation studies.","Indu, Purushothaman; Rameshkumar, Marimuthu Ragavan; Arunagirinathan, Narasingam; Al-Dhabi, Naif Abdullah; Valan Arasu, Mariadhas; Ignacimuthu, Savarimuthu",J Infect Public Health,294,25

Pregnant women are exposed to additional pressure due to the indirect adverse effects of this pandemic on their physical and mental health. Since the psychological wellness framework is weak in developing countries, it is likely that geographical factors affect the prevalence. Therefore, the goal of this meta-analysis is to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We searched databases including PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library for articles. The quality of studies was determined based on the STROBE checklist. I2 and Cochrane Q-test were used to determine heterogeneity. Fixed effects and/or random effects models were also employed to estimate pooled prevalence. RESULTS: Since heterogeneity was fairly high in all analyses, the random effect model was used. According to the results of random effects in the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence was 18.7% (95% CI: 0.06-0.36%; I2=99%,P<0.001) for anxiety and 25.1% (95% CI: 0.18-0.33%; I2=97%, P<0.001) for depression. The results of continent subgroup analysis showed that the prevalence of anxiety was higher in western country (38%) than in Asia country (7.8%). The prevalence of anxiety in Italy (38%), Canada (56%), Pakistan (14%), Greece (53%), Sri Lanka (17.5%), and China (0.3-29%) and Iran 3.8% as well as the prevalence of depression in Canada (37%), Belgium (25%), Turkey (35.4%), Sri Lanka (19.5%), and China (11-29%) has been reported. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 may impose extra pressure on the emotional wellbeing of pregnant women. Therefore, there is an urgent need for resources to help mitigate anxiety and depression in pregnant women.","Ghazanfarpour, Masumeh; Bahrami, Fereshteh; Rashidi Fakari, Farzaneh; Ashrafinia, Farzane; Babakhanian, Masoudeh; Dordeh, Mohammad; Abdi, Fatemeh",J Psychosom Obstet Gynaecol,294,16

AIMS: Given the current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, it was the aim of this scope review to update knowledge on factors affecting seasonal influenza vaccine uptake among older adults to strengthen prevention approaches in the context of an overall burden of infectious diseases. METHODS: We searched bibliographic databases from 2012 to 2019. All studies reviewed one or more social determinant of health listed by WHO, or factors affecting the decision-making process whether to accept influenza vaccine or not. RESULTS: Overall, 44 studies were included, 41 determinants were extracted and summarized into six categories. Older age and constitutional factors including multiple chronic diseases as well as preventive lifestyle and frequent routine healthcare utilization positively affected vaccination uptake (VU). Living and working conditions are also researched determinants of influenza vaccine uptake. A small number of studies explored the role of social inclusion and system-based interventions. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This scope review provides a comprehensive overview on factors affecting seasonal influenza vaccination uptake among older citizens. The review also clearly shows gaps for evidence on system-based level or political strategies to improve vaccination uptake.","Roller-Wirnsberger, Regina; Lindner, Sonja; Kolosovski, Lea; Platzer, Elisabeth; Dovjak, Peter; Flick, Holger; Tziraki, Chariklia; Illario, Maddalena",Aging clin. exp. res,294,16

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the impact of initial government policies on this vulnerable older population between the UK and Australia during the first wave of attack. METHODS: We searched websites of governments in the UK and Australia and media outlets. We examined the key policies including the national lockdown dates and the distribution of some important resources (personal protective equipment and testing) and the effects of these initial policies on the mortality rates in the aged care homes during the first wave of attack of COVID-19. RESULTS: We found that both countries had prioritized resources to hospitals over aged care homes during the first wave of attack. Both countries had lower priority for aged care residents in hospitals (e.g. discharging without testing for COVID-19 or discouraging admissions). However, deaths in aged care homes were 270 times higher in the UK than in Australia as on 7 May 2020 (despite UK having a population only 2.5 times larger than Australia). The lower fatality rate in Australia may have been due to the earlier lockdown strategy when the total daily cases were low in Australia (118) compared to the UK (over 1000), as well as the better community viral testing regime in Australia. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the public health policy in Australia aimed towards earlier intervention with earlier national lockdown and more viral testing to prevent new cases. This primary prevention could have resulted in more lives being saved. In contrast, the initial policy in the UK focussed mainly on protecting resources for hospitals, and there was a delay in national lockdown intervention and lower viral testing rate, resulting in more lives lost in the aged care sector.","Chan, Daniel Kam Yin; Mclaws, Mary-Louise; Forsyth, Duncan Ronald",Int. j. qual. health care,294,24

We investigated changes in depression and anxiety symptoms (overall and severe) from before to during the pandemic, as well as whether these changes are linked to COVID-19-related stressors and pre-existing vulnerabilities in young adults followed in the context of a population-based cohort. METHOD: Participants (n = 1039) from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development reported on their depression (Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, short form) and anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale) symptoms and completed a COVID-19 questionnaire during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the summer of 2020 (age 22 years). Assessments at age 20 (2018) were used to estimate pre-pandemic depression and anxiety symptom severity. RESULTS: While mean levels of depression and anxiety symptoms did not change from before to during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., the mean of depressive symptoms was 9.30 in 2018 and 9.59 in 2020), we observed a slight increase in rates of severe depression (scores ≥ 21) from before (6.1%) to during (8.2%) the pandemic. Most COVID-19-related variables (e.g., loss of education/occupation, frequent news-seeking) – except living alone – and most pre-existing vulnerabilities (e.g., low SES, low social support) were not associated with changes in depression or anxiety symptoms. However, results varied as a function of pre-pandemic levels of depression and anxiety: depression and anxiety symptoms increased among adults with the lowest levels of symptoms before the pandemic, while they decreased among those with the highest levels of symptoms, possibly reflecting a regression to the mean. CONCLUSIONS: Depression and anxiety symptoms in young adults from Québec in Summer 2020 were mostly comparable to symptoms reported in 2018. Most COVID-19-related stressors and pre-existing vulnerabilities were not associated with changes in symptoms, except living alone and pre-existing symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, the increased rate of severe depression warrants further investigation.

DESIGN: Rapid antigen testing, viral culture, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) testing for up to 15 viruses in symptomatic residents and chart review. SETTING: A 120‐bed LTCF. MEASUREMENTS: Comparison of rapid antigen testing, respiratory viral cultures, and DFA testing and RT‐PCR in residents with symptoms of a respiratory tract infection. RESULTS: Twenty‐two of 52 residents developed symptoms of a respiratory tract infection between January 29, 2008, and February 26, 2008. RSV was detected using RT‐PCR in seven (32%) of the 22 cases. None of the seven cases had positive RSV rapid antigen testing, and only two had positive culture or DFA results. This outbreak occurred during a time when state wide RSV rates were rapidly declining. One patient was admitted to the hospital during the infection and subsequently died. CONCLUSION: RSV may cause outbreaks in LTCFs that traditional diagnostic methods do not detect. RT‐PCR can provide a more timely and accurate diagnosis of outbreaks, which allows for early symptomatic treatment, rational use of antibiotics, and improved infection control.","Caram, L.

This study aimed to understand the contextual, media, and economic factors associated with anticipated mental health consequences from the COVID-19 pandemic among Americans. A nationally representative survey of 1001 respondents was conducted in April 2020. Chi-square tests and logistic regressions examined anticipated emotional or psychological effects on respondents or members of their households should social distancing measures continue. Specific analyses focused on: 1) COVID-19 experience - knowing someone or being infected; living in a state with a high death rate; or state social distancing policies; 2) media exposure - source of coronavirus information and time spent on coronavirus news; and 3) economics - current economic effects; and anticipated long-term financial effects. 41% of respondents anticipated mental health consequences. Living in a state with a greater COVID-19 death rate (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.10, 2.72) and anticipating long-term financial difficulties (OR 2.98; 95% CI 1.93, 4.60) were both associated with greater likelihood of anticipated mental health consequences. Those whose primary news source was television, as opposed to print or online, were almost 50% less likely to anticipate mental health challenges (OR 0.52 CI 0.33, 0.81), while those who reported spending two or more hours daily on COVID-19 news were 90% more likely (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.27, 2.85).

The present paper examines this question by means of a set of cross-sectional studies conducted in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, in May, June, and July of 2020. Using stratified samples that mimic the demographic characteristics of the U.S. population, it seeks to understand to what extent Americans continued to adhere to social distancing measures in the period after the first lockdown ended. Moreover, it seeks to uncover which variables sustained (or undermined) adherence across this period. For this purpose, we examined a broad range of factors, relating to people’s (1) knowledge and understanding of the mitigation measures, (2) perceptions of their costs and benefits, (3) perceptions of legitimacy and procedural justice, (4) personal factors, (5) social environment, and (6) practical circumstances. Our findings reveal that adherence was chiefly shaped by three major factors: respondents adhered more when they (a) had greater practical capacity to adhere, (b) morally agreed more with the measures, and (c) perceived the virus as a more severe health threat. Adherence was shaped to a lesser extent by impulsivity, knowledge of social distancing measures, opportunities for violating, personal costs, and descriptive social norms. The results also reveal, however, that adherence declined across this period, which was partly explained by changes in people’s moral alignment, threat perceptions, knowledge, and perceived social norms. These findings show that adherence originates from a broad range of factors that develop dynamically across time. Practically these insights help to improve pandemic governance, as well as contributing theoretically to the study of compliance and the way that rules come to shape behavior.","Reinders Folmer, Christopher P.; Brownlee, Megan A.; Fine, Adam D.; Kooistra, Emmeke B.; Kuiper, Malouke E.; Olthuis, Elke H.; de Bruijn, Anne Leonore; van Rooij, Benjamin",PLoS One,294,26

Tanreqing Capsule (TRQC) was used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients in the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. This study aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy of TRQC in the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 82 patients who had laboratory-confirmed mild and moderate COVID-19; patients were treated with TRQC in one designated hospital. The treatment and control groups consisted of 25 and 57 cases, respectively. The treatment group was given TRQC orally three times a day, three pills each time, in addition to conventional Western medicine treatments which were also administered to the control group. The clinical efficacy indicators, such as the negative conversion time of pharyngeal swab nucleic acid, the negative conversion time of fecal nucleic acid, the duration of negative conversion of pharyngeal-fecal nucleic acid, and the improvement in the level of immune indicators such as T-cell subsets (CD3, CD4 and CD45) were monitored. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients in the treatment group, compared to the control group, had a shorter negative conversion time of fecal nucleic acid (4 vs. 9 days, P = 0.047) and a shorter interval of negative conversion of pharyngeal-fecal nucleic acid (0 vs. 2 days, P = 0.042). The level of CD3(+) T cells increased in the treatment group compared to the control group ([317.09 ± 274.39] vs. [175.02 ± 239.95] counts/μL, P = 0.030). No statistically significant differences were detected in the median improvement in levels of CD4(+) T cells (173 vs. 107 counts/μL, P = 0.208) and CD45(+) T cells (366 vs. 141 counts/μL, P = 0.117) between the treatment and control groups. CONCLUSION: Significant reductions in the negative conversion time of fecal nucleic acid and the duration of negative conversion of pharyngeal-fecal nucleic acid were identified in the treatment group as compared to the control group, illustrating the potential therapeutic benefits of using TRQC as a complement to conventional medicine in patients with mild and moderate COVID-19. The underlying mechanism may be related to the improved levels of the immune indicator CD3(+) T cells.","Zhang, Xing; Xue, Yan; Chen, Xuan; Wu, Jia-min; Su, Zi-jian; Sun, Meng; Liu, Lu-jiong; Zhang, Yi-bao; Zhang, Yi-le; Xu, Gui-hua; Shi, Miao-yan; Song, Xiu-ming; Lu, Yun-fei; Chen, Xiao-rong; Zhang, Wei; Chen, Qi",J Integr Med,294,16

Italy has one of the highest numbers of SARS-CoV-2-related deaths and one of the highest mortality rates. Worldwide, a more severe course of COVID-19 is associated with older age, comorbidities, and male sex. Hence, we searched for possible genetic components of COVID-19 severity among Italians by looking at expression levels and variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, crucial for viral infection. Exome and SNP-array data from a large Italian cohort were used to compare the rare-variants burden and polymorphisms frequency with Europeans and East Asians. Moreover, we looked into gene expression databases to check for sex-unbalanced expression. While we found no significant evidence that ACE2 is associated with disease severity/sex bias, TMPRSS2 levels and genetic variants proved to be possible candidate disease modulators, prompting for rapid experimental validations on large patient cohorts.","Asselta, Rosanna; Paraboschi, Elvezia Maria; Mantovani, Alberto; Duga, Stefano",Aging (Albany NY),294,21

Prior work has established that secreted NS1 levels in plasma correlates with viremia levels and hence can also be used to diagnose patients at the risk for developing dengue hemorrhagic fever. Thus detection of non-structural dengue antigens may be of benefit for an early rapid diagnosis of dengue infection due to its long half life in the blood. Here we describe a simple and efficient method for the expression of NS1 in Escherichia coli, which could potentially be used to develop monoclonal and bispecific antibodies for point of care diagnostics. E. coli codon optimized synthetic full-length NS1 gene of dengue serotype 1 (DEN-1) was successfully cloned and expressed in very high-level as inclusion bodies. The NS1 protein was successfully affinity purified and refolded as a recombinant NS1 (rNS1) protein in E. coli and yield was 230–250 mg/L of bacterial culture. The rNS1 protein was used to immunize mice for hybridoma development. The polyclonal antiserum from animals immunized with this rNS1 protein was found to specifically recognize the rNS1, thus demonstrating the immunogenic nature of the protein. The rNS1 protein purified from E. coli could be useful for developing a sensitive serum diagnostic assay to monitor dengue outbreaks.","Das, Dipankar; Mongkolaungkoon, Sunundha; Suresh, Mavanur R.",Protein Expr Purif,294,1

An RBD219-N1 formulation Alhydrogel® was also superior to the S protein, unadjuvanted RBD, and AddaVax (MF59-like adjuvant)-formulated RBD in inducing specific antibodies and preventing cellular infiltrates in the lungs upon SARS-CoV challenge. Specifically, a formulation with a 1:25 ratio of RBD219-N1 to Alhydrogel® provided high neutralizing antibody titers, 100% protection with non-detectable viral loads with minimal or no eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates.

Could Vitamin D, which modulates IL-6, be more effective than currently deployed IL-6 antagonists, including tocilizumab, thereby presenting a useful therapeutic option in COVID-19? A narrative review of published trials examining the effect of Vitamin D administration in COVID-19 patients was conducted, and the theoretical basis for the use of tocilizumab as an IL-6 antagonist was compared with the immunomodulatory effect of Vitamin D on IL-6 production. Four of the six included studies reported a positive effect of Vitamin D on outcomes. While tocilizumab non-selectively blocks both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory actions of IL-6, Vitamin D lowers immune cell IL-6 production, potentially reducing pro-inflammatory effects, but does not specifically target IL-6 receptors, avoiding any deleterious effect on the anti-inflammatory actions of IL-6. Vitamin D may have advantages over tocilizumab as an IL-6 immunomodulator, and, given that it is safe if administered under clinical supervision, there is a strong rationale for its use.","Silberstein, Morry",Eur J Pharmacol,294,20

METHODS AND MEASURES: Data were collected from 933 community-based adults without a previous diagnosis of PTSD in June 2020. The Primary Care PTSD Screen was adapted to assess pandemic-related PTSD symptoms. Participants were asked if alcohol or cannabis use had increased in the past month. Adjusted logistic regression models examined associations between pandemic-related PTSD symptoms and substance use. RESULTS: More women (19%) than men (13%) met criteria for high pandemic-related PTSD symptomology, while a similar percentage (13.4% of women, 13.2% of men) reported significant increases in substance use during the pandemic. Adults 18–35 years; those who believed they would become infected with the virus; and those with low income, education, or pandemic-related job loss were more likely to report PTSD symptoms. High pandemic-related PTSD symptomology was associated with a significant substance use increase among both women (OR = 2.2) and men (OR = 2.3) in adjusted models. Many adults (50% of women, 40% of men) reported they needed help to address these problems. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic-related PTSD symptoms were common among adults during Wave 1 of COVID-19. These symptoms were associated with a significant increase in substance use among women and men. Many adults voiced a need for help with these problems. Findings suggest substance use interventions that consider and address pandemic-related PTSD symptoms may be needed.","Currie, Cheryl L.",Addict Behav Rep,294,24

Moreover, the health monitoring system is preferred to be realized in a small form factor for convenient mass deployments. A CMOS-integrated coherent sensing platform is proposed to achieve the goal, which synergetically leverages quadrature coherent photoacoustic (PA) detection and coherent radar sensing for achieving universal healthcare. By utilizing configurable mixed-signal quadrature coherent PA detection, high sensitivity and enhanced specificity can be achieved. In-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) templates are specifically designed to accurately sense and precisely reconstruct the target PA signals in a coherent mode. By mixed-signal implementation leveraging an FPGA to generate template waveforms adaptively, accurate tracking and precise reconstruction on the target PA signal can be attained based on the early-late tracking principle. The multiplication between the received PA signal and the templates is implemented efficiently in analog-domain by the Gilbert cell on-chip. In vivo blood temperature monitoring was realized based on the integrated PA sensing platform fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process. With an integrated radar sensor deployed in the indoor scenario, noncontact monitoring on respiration and heartbeat rates can be attained based on electromagnetic (EM) sensing. By complementary usage of PA-EM sensing mechanisms, comprehensive health status monitoring and precise remote disease diagnostics can be achieved for the currentglobal COVID-19 pandemic and the future pervasive healthcare in the Internet of Everything (IoE) era.","Fang, Zhongyuan; Yang, Chuanshi; Zheng, Zesheng; Jin, Haoran; Tang, Kai; Lou, Liheng; Tang, Xiaoyan; Wang, Wensong; Zheng, Yuanjin",IEEE Trans Biomed Circuits Syst,294,20

METHOD: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Jimma University Medical Center among 249 healthcare professionals. The data were collected using self-administered questionnaires between 22 and 28 March 2020. The psychological impact was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale – Revised (IES-R) and symptoms of insomnia were measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Social support was evaluated using the three-item Oslo Social Support Scale. Data were analysed using logistic regression to examine mutually adjusted associations, expressed as adjusted odds ratios. The psychosocial status of the healthcare professionals was predicted using a classification tree model supported by the genetic search method. RESULTS: The prevalence of psychological distress among healthcare professionals was 78.3%. The mean IES-R score was 34.2 (s.d. = 19.4). The ISI score indicated that the prevalence of insomnia was 50.2%. Higher psychological distress was associated with younger age, having insomnia, not having a daily update on COVID-19, and feeling stigmatised and rejected in the neighbourhood because of hospital work.

In this axis, angiotensin (Ang)-(1–7) is finally produced from Ang I or Ang II by the catalytic activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Ang-(1–7) shows actions different from those of AT(1) receptor stimulation, such as vasodilatation, natriuresis, anti-proliferation and an increase in the bradykinin–NO (nitric oxide) system. As the catalytic efficiency of ACE2 is approximately 400-fold higher with Ang II as a substrate than with Ang I, this axis is possibly acting as a counter-regulatory system against the ACE/Ang II/AT(1) receptor axis. The signaling pathway of the ACE2–Ang-(1–7) axis has not yet been totally and clearly understood. However, a recent report suggests that the Mas oncogene acts as a receptor for Ang-(1–7). Intracellular signaling through Mas is not clear yet. Several factors such as Akt phosphorylation, protein kinase C activation and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibition seem to be involved in this signaling pathway. Further investigations are needed to clarify the regulation and mechanism of action of ACE2 and Ang-(1–7).

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of these conditions and is an increasing problem due to ageing of the world’s population and an increase in cardiovascular risk factors that predispose to AF. The goal of the AF roadmap was to provide guidance on priority interventions that are feasible in multiple countries, and to identify roadblocks and potential strategies to overcome them. Since publication of the AF Roadmap in 2017, there have been many technological advances including devices and artificial intelligence for identification and prediction of unknown AF, better methods to achieve rhythm control, and widespread uptake of smartphones and apps that could facilitate new approaches to healthcare delivery and increasing community AF awareness. In addition, the World Health Organisation added the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) to the Essential Medicines List, making it possible to increase advocacy for their widespread adoption as therapy to prevent stroke. These advances motivated the WHF to commission a 2020 AF Roadmap update. Three years after the original Roadmap publication, the identified barriers and solutions were judged still relevant, and progress has been slow. This 2020 Roadmap update reviews the significant changes since 2017 and identifies priority areas for achieving the goals of reducing death and disability related to AF, particularly targeted at low-middle income countries. These include advocacy to increase appreciation of the scope of the problem; plugging gaps in guideline management and prevention through physician education, increasing patient health literacy, and novel ways to increase access to integrated healthcare including mHealth and digital transformations; and greater emphasis on achieving practical solutions to national and regional entrenched barriers. Despite the advances reviewed in this update, the task will not be easy, but the health rewards of implementing solutions that are both innovative and practical will be great.","Freedman, Ben; Hindricks, Gerhard; Banerjee, Amitava; Baranchuk, Adrian; Ching, Chi Keong; Du, Xin; Fitzsimons, Donna; Healey, Jeff S.; Ikeda, Takanori; Lobban, Trudie C.

At this juncture, this paper examines the determinants of the adoption of mobile payment services among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in China. The study proposes four-dimensional factors (business factors, technological competence, environment, and consumers' intentions) based on the literature review findings to understand the challenges of adopting mobile payment. A questionnaire is designed to solicit information from the participants. The findings reveal that business factors, technological competencies of SMEs in China, and the environment positively influence mobile payment adoption. Consumer intention has almost no influence on the adoption of mobile payment. Potential implications for the COVID-19 era are also discussed.","Cao, Tianming",Front Public Health,294,16

As a result, there has been considerable economic distress globally and a significant loss of life. Sadly, the vulnerable and immunocompromised in our societies seem to be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 complications. Global public health bodies and governments have ignited strategies and issued advisories on various handwashing and hygiene guidelines, social distancing strategies, and, in the most extreme cases, some countries have adopted “stay in place” or lockdown protocols to prevent COVID-19 spread. Notably, there are several significant risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection. These include the presence of poor nutritional status and pre-existing noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes mellitus, chronic lung diseases, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), obesity, and various other diseases that render the patient immunocompromised. These diseases are characterized by systemic inflammation, which may be a common feature of these NCDs, affecting patient outcomes against COVID-19. In this review, we discuss some of the anti-inflammatory therapies that are currently under investigation intended to dampen the cytokine storm of severe COVID-19 infections. Furthermore, nutritional status and the role of diet and lifestyle is considered, as it is known to affect patient outcomes in other severe infections and may play a role in COVID-19 infection. This review speculates the importance of nutrition as a mitigation strategy to support immune function amid the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying food groups and key nutrients of importance that may affect the outcomes of respiratory infections.","Zabetakis, Ioannis; Lordan, Ronan; Norton, Catherine; Tsoupras, Alexandros",Nutrients,294,18

The survey included categorical socio-demographic and health-related variables. A total of 1830 participants were selected for statistical data processing (a response rate of 90.9%). We determined reasonable reliability of the survey section for clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Cronbach’s Alpha 0.671). Two meaningful dimensions were identified through CATPCA (Categorical Principal Component Analysis) for the survey’s items. We separated two significant clusters of items, each measuring a distinct factor: the sociodemographic characteristics linked to social distancing and the relevant clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Next, a two-step cluster analysis helped to classify the sample group taking into consideration the similarity of subjects. The clustering revealed a three-cluster solution, with significant differences between clusters and allowed the cluster detection of a group of individuals, possibly more affected by the infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Through binomial logistic regression analysis, we identified a statistically significant prediction model for the presumptive diagnostic of some relevant clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study validated a cost-effective model for rapid assessment of the health status of subjects, adapted to the context of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Ciucurel, Constantin; Iconaru, Elena Ioana",Int J Environ Res Public Health,294,14

Additionally, understanding the potential mechanisms of neurologic injury may guide efforts to better detect and ameliorate these complications. In this review, we synthesize a range of clinical observations and initial case series describing potential neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 and place these observations in the context of coronavirus neuro-pathophysiology as it may relate to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Reported nervous system manifestations range from anosmia and ageusia, to cerebral hemorrhage and infarction. While the volume of COVID-19-related case studies continues to grow, previous work examining related viruses suggests potential mechanisms through which the novel coronavirus may impact the CNS and result in neurological complications. Namely, animal studies examining the SARS-CoV have implicated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 receptor as a mediator of coronavirus-related neuronal damage and have shown that SARS-CoV can infect cerebrovascular endothelium and brain parenchyma, the latter predominantly in the medial temporal lobe, resulting in apoptosis and necrosis. Human postmortem brain studies indicate that human coronavirus variants and SARS-CoV can infect neurons and glia, implying SARS-CoV-2 may have similar neurovirulence. Additionally, studies have demonstrated an increase in cytokine serum levels as a result of SARS-CoV infection, consistent with the notion that cytokine overproduction and toxicity may be a relevant potential mechanism of neurologic injury, paralleling a known pathway of pulmonary injury. We also discuss evidence that suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be a vasculotropic and neurotropic virus. Early reports suggest COVID-19 may be associated with severe neurologic complications, and several plausible mechanisms exist to account for these observations. A heightened awareness of the potential for neurologic involvement and further investigation into the relevant pathophysiology will be necessary to understand and ultimately mitigate SARS-CoV-2-associated neurologic injury.","Aghagoli, Ghazal; Gallo Marin, Benjamin; Katchur, Nicole J.; Chaves-Sell, Franz; Asaad, Wael F.; Murphy, Sarah A.",Neurocrit Care,294,24

During purification, the full-length GST-RdRp was found to cleave into three main fragments: an N-terminal p12 fragment, a middle p30 fragment, and a C-terminal p64 fragment comprising the catalytic domain, presumably due to bacterial proteases. Biochemical assays show that the full-length GST-RdRp has RdRp activity and the p64 and p12 fragments form a complex that exhibits comparable RdRp activity, whereas the GST-p64 protein has no activity, suggesting that the p12 domain is required for polymerase activity possibly via involvement in template-primer binding.

We studied the historical development of the for-profit hospital sector across 4 nations with contrasting trends in for-profit hospital market share: the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands. We focused on 3 factors that we believed might help explain why the role of for-profits grew in some nations but not in others: (1) the treatment of for-profits by public reimbursement plans, (2) physicians’ financial interests, and (3) the effect of the political environment. We conclude that access to subsidies and reimbursement under favorable terms from public health care payors is an important factor in the rise of for-profit hospitals. Arrangements that aligned financial incentives of physicians with the interests of for-profit hospitals were important in stimulating for-profit growth in an earlier era, but they play little role at present.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the pathogen that causes COVID-19. It invades human tissues through the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, resulting in an imbalance in the angiotensin II (AngII) level and upregulation of renin-angiotensin system/AngII pathway activity. Furthermore, the binding of AngII to its receptor leads to vasoconstriction, endothelial injury and intravascular thrombosis.

Several vulnerabilities overlap with precarious housing conditions, lack of basic sanitation, malnutrition, and endemicity for neglected chronic diseases such as visceral leishmaniasis (VL). COVID-19 and VL evidently do not share clinical features, but exactly because of the distinct immunopathogenesis between the diseases, patients with VL may present a vulnerability in the immune system against antiviral responses. Considering that VL susceptibility seems to be related to an inefficient and polarized immune response, it is likely that in endemic areas, the overlap of social weaknesses added to individual vulnerability by immune polarization may aggravate the COVID-19 condition. In this sense, we reinforce that possible relationships between endemic neglected diseases such as VL and pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection need to be further considered and investigated.","Carvalho, Sílvio Fernando Guimarães; Vieira, Thallyta Maria; Moura, Ana Paula Venuto; Andrade, Marileia Chaves",Med Hypotheses,294,1

Socioeconomic position was defined according to highest level of education (post-16 qualifications: yes/no). Results: Compared with never smokers (0.3% [95%CI 0.2-0.3%]), prevalence of confirmed COVID-19 was higher among current (0.6% [0.4-0.8%]) but not ex-smokers (0.2% [0.2-0.3%]). The associations were similar before (current: OR 2.14 [1.49-3.08]; ex-smokers: OR 0.73 [0.47-1.14]) and after (current: OR 1.79 [1.22-2.62]; ex-smokers: OR 0.85 [0.54-1.33]) adjustment for potential confounders. For current smokers, this was moderated by socioeconomic position, with higher rates relative to never smokers only seen in those without post-16 qualifications (OR 3.53 [2.04-6.10]). After including suspected cases, prevalence was higher among current smokers (11.2% [10.6-11.9%], OR 1.11 [1.03-1.20]) and ex-smokers (10.9% [10.4-11.5%], OR 1.07 [1.01-1.15]) than never smokers (10.2% [9.9-10.6%]), but remained higher only among ex-smokers after adjustment (OR 1.21 [1.13-1.29]). Current and ex-smokers had higher odds than never smokers of reporting significant stress about catching (current: OR 1.43 [1.35-1.52]; ex-smokers: OR 1.15 [1.09-1.22]) or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 (current: OR 1.34 [1.27-1.43]; ex-smokers: OR 1.22 [1.16-1.28]). Adherence to recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 was generally high (96.3% [96.1-96.4%]), but lower among current than never smokers (OR 0.70 [0.62-0.78]). Conclusions: When assessed by self-report in a population sample, current smoking was independently associated with confirmed COVID-19 infection. There were socioeconomic disparities, with the association only apparent among those without post-16 qualifications. Smokers reported lower adherence to guidelines despite being more worried than non-smokers about catching or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19.","Jackson, Sarah E; Brown, Jamie; Shahab, Lion; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",,294,20

The ORS can be prepared in water or milk. The aim of the present study was to elucidate how fluid and acid-base balance change after feeding milk compared with ORS prepared in water or milk to diarrheic calves. Calves (n = 30) with naturally acquired diarrhea were sequentially assigned in a 2:1 ratio to the following pretreatments: milk and water-ORS (pretreatment 1; n = 20 calves) or milk-ORS (pretreatment 2; n = 10 calves), respectively. The assignment was done on the day of diarrhea diagnosis. On d 3 ± 1 following assignment to pretreatment group, and after a fasting period of 9 h, diarrheic calves were subjected to the following treatments: 2 L of milk (pretreatment 1; n = 10 calves), water-ORS (pretreatment 1; n = 10 calves), or milk-ORS (pretreatment 2; n = 10 calves). Blood samples were taken before and at several time points until 6 h after feeding. Plasma protein, osmolality, and electrolytes were determined and a blood gas analysis was performed. Change in plasma volume was calculated according to plasma protein, and water intake during the experimental period was recorded. Plasma volume was increased 30 min after feeding water-ORS or milk but the increase was less pronounced after feeding milk compared with water-ORS. After feeding milk-ORS, no significant increase in plasma volume could be detected. Because of the pretreatment, plasma osmolality was higher in calves fed milk-ORS, but no change in plasma osmolality after feeding was detected. No difference in water consumption between the treatment groups was noted within the observed 6-h period. The pH was increased after feeding milk-ORS, whereas water-ORS and milk-feeding did not increase pH in blood. Pretreatment with milk-ORS resulted in higher baseline d-lactate concentration, but feeding milk-ORS reduced d-lactate values after feeding. In calves with diarrhea, plasma volume increased more quickly and to a greater extent after feeding water-ORS; thus, we recommend treating diarrheic calves with water-ORS before supplying milk. Nevertheless, diarrheic calves need milk to fulfill their energy needs. The administration of ORS in milk combined with free water access is more advisable than feeding milk exclusively because milk has no alkalinizing ability and contains less sodium. However, the effects of milk-ORS feeding on d-lactate levels in diarrheic calves need further elucidation.","Wenge-Dangschat, J.; Steinhöfel, I.; Coenen, M.; Tuchscherer, A.; Hammon, H.M.; Bachmann, L.",J Dairy Sci,294,28

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Our goal was to identify COVID-19-related stressors that patients associated with worsening rheumatic disease symptoms. METHODS: With approval of their rheumatologists, patients at an academic medical center were interviewed with open-ended questions about the impact of COVID-19 on daily life. Responses were analyzed with qualitative methods using grounded theory and a comparative analytic approach to generate categories of stressors. RESULTS: Of 112 patients enrolled (mean age 50 years, 86% women, 34% non-white or Latino, 30% with lupus, 26% with rheumatoid arthritis), 2 patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients reported that coping with challenges due to the pandemic both directly and indirectly worsened their rheumatic disease symptoms. Categories associated with direct effects were increased fatigue (i.e., from multitasking, physical work, and taking precautions to avoid infection) and worsening musculoskeletal and cognitive function. Categories associated with indirect effects were psychological worry (i.e., about contracting SARS-COV-2, altering medications, impact on family, and impact on job and finances) and psychological stress (i.e., at work, at home, from non-routine family responsibilities, about uncertainty related to SARS-CoV-2, and from the media). Patients often reported several effects coalesced in causing more rheumatic disease symptoms. CONCLUSION: Coping with the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with rheumatic disease–related physical and psychological effects, even among patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2. According to patients, these effects adversely impacted their rheumatic diseases. Clinicians will need to ascertain the long-term sequelae of these effects and determine what therapeutic and psychological interventions are indicated.

We discuss limited transmissibility of the virus by asymptomatic and mild cases of COVID-19 patients in Bhutan. We followed up the secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the contacts of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients in Bhutan. Bhutan had 33 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country as of May 29, 2020. Of these, 22 (67%) were females. Except the first two cases (American tourists), the rest were Bhutanese living outside the country. The mean age of the Bhutanese patients was 26.3 (range 16–33) years. Close contacts of 27 of the 33 cases were followed up for signs and symptoms and COVID-19 positivity. The first two cases had 73 and 97 primary contacts, respectively, and equal number of secondary contacts (224). From the third case, a mandatory 21-day facility quarantine was instituted, all primary contacts were facility quarantined, and there were no secondary contacts. In total, the 27 cases had 1,095 primary contacts and 448 secondary contacts. Of these, 75 individuals were categorized as definite high-risk contacts. Secondary transmission occurred in seven high-risk contacts. Therefore, the overall secondary transmission was 9.0% (7/75) and 0.6% (7/1,095) among the high-risk and primary contacts, respectively. No transmission occurred in the secondary contacts. In contrast to several reports indicating high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in contacts of confirmed cases, the mostly young, asymptomatic, and mild cases of COVID-19 in Bhutan showed limited secondary transmission.","Tshokey, Tshokey; Choden, Jamyang; Dorjee, Kinley; Pempa, Pempa; Yangzom, Pema; Gyeltshen, Wangdi; Wangchuk, Sonam; Dorji, Tandin; Wangmo, Dechen",Am J Trop Med Hyg,294,5

The symptoms can be nonspecific; therefore, it can be difficult to identify and treat the cause. However, an understanding of the specific immune defect, clinical parameters such as speed of onset, and radiological findings, allows the logical diagnostic and treatment plan to be made. Radiological findings can include consolidation, nodules, and diffuse changes such as ground glass and tree-in-bud changes. Common infections that induce these symptoms include bacterial pneumonia, invasive fungal disease, Pneumocystis jirovecii and respiratory viruses. These infections must be differentiated from inflammatory complications that often require immune suppressive treatment. The diagnosis can be refined with the aid of investigations such as bronchoscopy, computed tomography (CT) guided lung biopsy, culture, and serological tests. This article gives a schema to approach patients with respiratory symptoms in this patient group; however, in the common scenario of a rapidly deteriorating patient, treatment often has to begin empirically, with the aim to de-escalate treatment subsequently after targeted investigations.","Periselneris, J; Brown, J S",Med Mycol,294,26

A SINDy-LM modeling method that can effectively balance model complexity and prediction accuracy is proposed based on data-driven technique. First, the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical systems (SINDy) method is used to discover and describe the nonlinear functional relationship between the dynamic terms in the model in accordance with the observation data of the COVID-19 epidemic. Moreover, the Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm is utilized to optimize the obtained model for improving the accuracy of the SINDy algorithm. Second, the obtained model, which is consistent with the logistic model in mathematical form with small errors and high robustness, is leveraged to review the epidemic situation in China. Otherwise, the evolution of the epidemic in Australia and Egypt is predicted, which demonstrates that this method has universality for constructing the global COVID-19 model. The proposed model is also compared with the extreme learning machine (ELM), which shows that the prediction accuracy of the SINDy-LM method outperforms that of the ELM method and the generated model has higher sparsity.","Jiang, Yu-Xin; Xiong, Xiong; Zhang, Shuo; Wang, Jia-Xiang; Li, Jia-Chun; Du, Lin",Nonlinear Dyn,294,20

We aimed to assess household transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and risk factors associated with infectivity and susceptibility to infection in Wuhan. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included the households of all laboratory-confirmed or clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases and laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections identified by the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention between Dec 2, 2019, and April 18, 2020. We defined households as groups of family members and close relatives who did not necessarily live at the same address and considered households that shared common contacts as epidemiologically linked. We used a statistical transmission model to estimate household secondary attack rates and to quantify risk factors associated with infectivity and susceptibility to infection, accounting for individual-level exposure history. We assessed how intervention policies affected the household reproductive number, defined as the mean number of household contacts a case can infect. FINDINGS: 27 101 households with 29 578 primary cases and 57 581 household contacts were identified. The secondary attack rate estimated with the transmission model was 15·6% (95% CI 15·2–16·0), assuming a mean incubation period of 5 days and a maximum infectious period of 22 days. Individuals aged 60 years or older were at a higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 than all other age groups. Infants aged 0–1 years were significantly more likely to be infected than children aged 2–5 years (odds ratio [OR] 2·20, 95% CI 1·40–3·44) and children aged 6–12 years (1·53, 1·01–2·34). Given the same exposure time, children and adolescents younger than 20 years of age were more likely to infect others than were adults aged 60 years or older (1·58, 1·28–1·95). Asymptomatic individuals were much less likely to infect others than were symptomatic cases (0·21, 0·14–0·31). Symptomatic cases were more likely to infect others before symptom onset than after (1·42, 1·30–1·55). After mass isolation of cases, quarantine of household contacts, and restriction of movement policies were implemented, household reproductive numbers declined by 52% among primary cases (from 0·25 [95% CI 0·24–0·26] to 0·12 [0·10–0·13]) and by 63% among secondary cases (from 0·17 [0·16–0·18] to 0·063 [0·057–0·070]). INTERPRETATION: Within households, children and adolescents were less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection but were more infectious than older individuals. Presymptomatic cases were more infectious and individuals with asymptomatic infection less infectious than symptomatic cases. These findings have implications for devising interventions for blocking household transmission of SARS-CoV-2, such as timely vaccination of eligible children once resources become available.

METHODS: All members of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology (SIGE) were invited to answer a web-based survey. RESULTS: Data of 121 hospitals from all 20 Italian regions were analyzed. Overall, 10.7% Gastroenterology Divisions have been converted to Covid Units. Outpatients consultations, endoscopic and ultrasound procedures were limited to urgencies and oncology indications in 85.1%, 96.2% and 72.2% of Units, respectively, and 46.7% of them suspended the screening for colorectal cancer. Moreover, 72.2% of the staff received a training for use of personal protective equipment, although 45.5% did not have sufficient devices for adequate replacement. Overall, 132 healthcare workers in 41 Gastroenterology Divisions were found to be infected.

Some of these tiny particles have caused disastrous pandemics that killed a large number of people with subsequent economic downturns. In addition, the quarantine situation itself encounters the challenges like the deficiency in the online educational system, psychiatric problems and poor international relations. Although viruses have a rather simple protein structure, they have structural heterogeneity with a high tendency to mutation that impedes their study. On top of the breadth of such worldwide worrying issues, there are profound scientific gaps, and several unanswered questions, like lack of vaccines or antivirals to combat these pathogens. Various detection techniques like the nucleic acid test, immunoassay, and microscopy have been developed; however, there is a tradeoff between their advantages and disadvantages like safety in sample collecting, invasiveness, sensitivity, response time, etc. One of the highly resolved techniques that can provide early-stage detection with fast experiment duration is plasmonics. This optical technique has the capability to detect viral proteins and genomes at the early stage via highly sensitive interaction between the biological target and the plasmonic chip. The efficiency of this technique could be proved using commercialized techniques like reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques. In this study, we aim to review the role of plasmonic technique in the detection of 11 deadliest viruses besides 2 common genital viruses for the human being. This is a rapidly moving topic of research, and a review article that encompasses the current findings may be useful for guiding strategies to deal with the pandemics. By investigating the potential aspects of this technique, we hope that this study could open new avenues toward the application of point-of-care techniques for virus detection at early stage that may inhibit the progressively hygienic threats.","Sohrabi, Foozieh; Saeidifard, Sajede; Ghasemi, Masih; Asadishad, Tannaz; Hamidi, Seyedeh Mehri; Hosseini, Seyed Masoud",Eur Phys J Plus,294,16

Statements relating to technology in education were coded for (1) the prioritized “action” and (2) the objective or “goal” of this strategy. Quantitative analysis of these codes revealed that the “action” was most frequently to introduce or improve technology (54.4%), and the “goal” most frequently related to enhancing teaching/course delivery/learning (34.2%). Strategic plans appeared to frequently focus on the technology itself, with little consideration for the human aspect of operating technology or readiness of programs to embrace technology. Moving forward, strategic priorities with respect to technology should be refocused towards system readiness and account for resources necessary for target user upskilling and acceptance.","Dresser, Jacob D.; Burmeister, Paul; Arya, Vibhuti; Wilby, Kyle John",Pharmacy (Basel),294,1

The construction of these clones is commonly based on high- or low-copy number plasmids, yeast artificial chromosomes, yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors, and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). Prokaryotic promoters have consistently been used for the transcription of these clones. The goal of this study was to develop a novel DENV infectious clone in a BAC under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter and to generate a virus with the fusion envelope-green fluorescent protein in an attempt to track virus infection. The transfection of Vero cells with a plasmid encoding the DENV infectious clone facilitated the recovery of infectious particles that increased in titer after serial passages in C6/36 cells. The plaque size and syncytia phenotypes of the recombinant virus were similar to those of the parental virus. Despite the observation of autonomous replication and the detection of low levels of viral genome after two passages, the insertion of green fluorescent protein and Renilla luciferase reporter genes negatively impacted virus rescue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using a DENV infectious clone under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter to facilitate the recovery of recombinant viruses without the need for in vitro transcription. This novel molecular clone will be useful for establishing the molecular basis of replication, assembly, and pathogenesis, evaluating potential antiviral drugs, and the development of vaccine candidates for attenuated recombinant viruses.","Usme-Ciro, Jose A.; Lopera, Jaime A.; Enjuanes, Luis; Almazán, Fernando; Gallego-Gomez, Juan C.",Virus Res,294,11

S(TR2) (an 88 kDa truncated SARS‐CoV TW1 S protein carrying the S fragments S‐74‐253, S‐294‐739, and S‐1129‐1255) is capable of expressing a major form of glycoprotein as endo H‐sensitive (∼115 kDa) in CHO cells. To establish stable expressing cell clones, we transfected CHO/dhFr‐cells with the amplifiable vectors ISID (IRES‐driven dhfr) and ISIZ (SV40‐driven dhfr) to select stepwise MTX, and observed enhanced ∼115 kDa glycoform generation through gene amplification. Following stepwise MTX selection, we compared gene amplification levels between two vectors in engineered CHO cell chromosomes. These results confirm that the IRES‐driven dhfr promoter generates greater gene amplification, which in turn enhances S(TR2) expression. Our results indicate that the ∼115 kDa glycoform of S(TR2) protein was capable of increasing after gene amplification. The S(TR2) glycoform did not change between suspension and serum‐free cultures, suggesting that the stable and amplified cell clones analyzed in this study have potential for producing homologous S(TR2) on a large scale. © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Methods: This single-center study included data concerning 658 COVID-19 patients, who were hospitalized in our institute, between April 20th, 2020 and July 30th, 2020. Demographic data, findings of the imaging studies, and laboratory test results were retrieved from the institutional digital database. Results: New onset AF (NOAF) was identified in 33 patients (5%). Patients who developed AF were older (72.42 ± 6.10 vs 53.78 ± 13.80, p < 0.001) and had higher frequencies of hypertension and heart failure compared to patients without NOAF (p < 0.001, for both). The CHA2DS2-VASc score was higher in patients, who developed NOAF, compared to those who did not during hospitalization for COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Subjects, who developed NOAF during hospitalization, had a higher leukocyte count, neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and procalcitonin levels compared to those without NOAF (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Diffuse lung infiltration was also more frequent in COVID-19 patients, who developed NOAF, during hospitalization (p = 0.015). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that age, CHA2DS2-VASc score, CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and presence of diffuse lung infiltration on thorax CT were predictive for NOAF. Conclusion: The prevalence of NOAF in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is higher than the general population. Age, CHA2DS2-VASc score, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and presence of diffuse lung infiltration on thorax CT may be used to identify patients at high risk for development of NOAF. Especially among these parameters, the presence of diffuse lung infiltration on thorax CT it was the most powerful independent predictor of NOAF development.","Kelesoglu, Saban; Yilmaz, Yucel; Ozkan, Eyup; Calapkorur, Bekir; Gok, Mustafa; Dursun, Zehra Bestepe; Kilic, Aysegul Ulu; Demirelli, Selami; Simsek, Ziya; Elcık, Deniz",J Electrocardiol,294,24

In March 2003, we reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) the discovery of a novel coronavirus (CoV) responsible for this newly emerged disease. SARS first emerged in Guangdong, China in November 2002, leading to major outbreaks in the Provincial capital Guangzhou in January. We first heard about these outbreaks in mid-February 2003. Hong Kong set up enhanced surveillance for all patients with severe pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Hong Kong, especially those with a travel history to Guangdong. Our investigation for known respiratory pathogens proved negative. We then started to look more broadly for unusual viruses, including attempting virus culture using a range of cell lines not normally used for respiratory viruses, broad-range PCR/RT-PCR, random primer RT-PCR methods as well as electron microscopy of a lung biopsy from a suspected patient. By March 17, 2003, we began to see subtle changes in FRhk 4 monkey kidney cells inoculated with specimens from two suspected patients. By electron microscopy, we could see virus particles within these cells and we then used fixed infected cells to demonstrate antibody responses in paired sera from a number of suspected SARS patients but not in controls. Using random RT-PCR, we were able to identify the virus as a novel coronavirus. The initial short RNA sequence of 646 nucleotides obtained from the random RT-PCR rapidly allowed the development of RT-PCR assays for detecting SARS patients (1). All these findings were shared in real-time via daily teleconferences organized by the WHO to link up laboratories working on this outbreak. Two other laboratories within the network (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA and Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg) reported similar findings from other SARS patients but others were still arguing for other aetiologies (e.g., human metapneumovirus). Sharing of data within the WHO network allowed a rapid consensus that the novel coronavirus was indeed the cause of SARS.","Peiris, Malik; Poon, Leo L M",Clin Chem,294,16

However, other marine mammal zoonoses, if left untreated, induce life‐threatening systemic diseases that could pose public health risks. As the number of zoonotic diseases rises, the diagnosis of and treatment for these emerging pathogens pose special challenges requiring the expertise of physicians, veterinarians and wildlife biologists.

OBJECTIVES: The incidence of newly diagnosed Ménière's disease (MD) patients before and during COVID-19 at our Institution was calculated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The period 2018-2020 was considered. Incidence was calculated as number of annual first MD diagnoses divided by the number of annual first audiological evaluations. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-three patients were considered. Annual incidence of MD at our institution was 1.3% in 2018, 1.2% in 2019, and 3.2% in 2020, resulting in a significant increase during COVID-19 pandemic (2018 vs. 2020, p=.00001; 2019 vs. 2020, p=.00001). MD patients in 2020 presented a higher number of vertigo attacks (2018 vs. 2020, p=.04; 2019 vs. 2020, p=.04) and higher Dizziness Handicap Inventory questionnaire (DHI) values (2018 vs. 2020, p=.02; 2019 vs. 2020, p=.03). During COVD-19 pandemic, MD patients reported significantly higher State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) - Y1 (2018 vs. 2020, p=.04; 2019 vs. 2020, p=.03). CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: A higher incidence of MD first diagnosis was calculated during COVID-19 pandemic; furthermore, MD patients presented with more vertigo attacks and higher DHI values.

The response strategy included early diagnosis, patient isolation, symptomatic monitoring of contacts as well as suspected and confirmed cases, and public health quarantine. In this context, telemedicine, particularly video consultations, has been promoted and scaled up to reduce the risk of transmission, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Based on a literature review, the first conceptual framework for telemedicine implementation during outbreaks was published in 2015. An updated framework for telemedicine in the COVID-19 pandemic has been defined. This framework could be applied at a large scale to improve the national public health response. Most countries, however, lack a regulatory framework to authorize, integrate, and reimburse telemedicine services, including in emergency and outbreak situations. In this context, Italy does not include telemedicine in the essential levels of care granted to all citizens within the National Health Service, while France authorized, reimbursed, and actively promoted the use of telemedicine. Several challenges remain for the global use and integration of telemedicine into the public health response to COVID-19 and future outbreaks. All stakeholders are encouraged to address the challenges and collaborate to promote the safe and evidence-based use of telemedicine during the current pandemic and future outbreaks. For countries without integrated telemedicine in their national health care system, the COVID-19 pandemic is a call to adopt the necessary regulatory frameworks for supporting wide adoption of telemedicine.","Ohannessian, Robin; Duong, Tu Anh; Odone, Anna",JMIR Public Health Surveill,294,18

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and the host's expression of this membrane-bound protein could affect susceptibility to infection. The RAAS is an important regulator of cardiovascular physiology and ACE2 has an essential role. People with hypertension and other traits have shown to have an imbalance in ACE/ACE2 levels and reduced levels of ACE2 could enhance the risk of adverse outcome in patients with COVID-19. It has been hypothesised that the RAAS may mediate the interplay between cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 severity. Evidence shows that antihypertensive drugs that target the RAAS have no significant effect on the risk of infection and disease outcome. Variations in RAAS genes have been associated with the risk of developing hypertension and cardiovascular disease and could partly explain the heterogenous response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This article explores the interplay between the RAAS and COVID-19, with emphasis on the possible relationship between genetic variations and disease severity.","Coto, Eliecer; Avanzas, Pablo; Gómez, Juan",Eur Cardiol,294,1

Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at high risk for pulmonary and other complications including acute chest syndrome (ACS) and have high rates of hospitalization from other viral respiratory infections, raising concern that COVID-19 would be associated with higher morbidity, mortality and health care utilization among those with SCD. Public health interventions such as social distancing, avoidance of large group activities, and widespread use of masks have been shown to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in the general population but have been inconsistently implemented. In Georgia, COVID-19 restrictions, including school closures, were implemented in mid-March, and on-site school instruction was replaced by virtual instruction for the remainder of the school year. At our institution, most routine, non-urgent outpatient clinic visits were cancelled or postponed from mid-March through May in order to minimize COVID-19 exposure risk. Efforts to initiate the use of telemedicine as an alternative to in-person office visits were rapidly instituted. We hypothesized that adherence to public health restrictions, especially sheltering in place, would be high among patients and families with SCD, and sought to measure the impact of COVID pandemic on healthcare utilization in children and adolescents with SCD in the Atlanta area. Methods The SCD Program at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) provides comprehensive outpatient, emergency and inpatient services at 3 locations in metropolitan Atlanta. CHOA's Sickle Cell Clinical Database (SCCD) contains prospectively collected demographic, diagnostic, treatment and other clinical information on all patients with SCD beginning in 2010, including all outpatient clinic, emergency department (ED) and inpatient hospital utilization. To assess the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare utilization, we tracked clinic, ED and inpatient utilization for the 4-month period (March through June) 2020 compared with the same 4-month period in 2018 and 2019. Results The figure shows utilization patterns for each four-month period from 2018-2020. As expected, face to face outpatient clinic visits fell dramatically from February to April 2020 (-25% in March, -64% in April) and then returned to pre-COVID levels by June. The addition of telemedicine visits raised total outpatient visits in June 2020 to above pre-COVID levels. Total utilization during the 4-month period in 2020 were compared to the mean for the same periods in 2018 and 2019. Face to face clinic visits decreased from 2971.5 to 2023 (-32%), ED visits from 1,217 to 687 (-44%), and total inpatient admissions from 699 to 410 (-41%). Admissions with a primary discharge diagnosis of pain decreased from a mean of 407 in 2018-2019 to 173 (-57%), fever/infection from 67.5 to 40 (-41%), and ACS from 101 to 75 (-26%). Patients with chronic pain and/or history of high utilization (>5 admissions in a given year) showed decreases in utilization similar to all other patients. Summary These data describe the significant changes in utilization among pediatric patients with SCD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Face to face outpatient clinic visits decreased during March and April but returned to pre-COVID levels in June. Unexpectedly, ED and inpatient hospital utilization for acute illness decreased dramatically through April and remained low through June. In March there was a significant decrease in the clinic setting due to a large number of cancelled or rescheduled outpatient visits, despite many being rescheduled as telemedicine visits. However, the largest unexpected decrease was seen in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for acute events, specifically fever and pain events. It is also important to note the decreased utilization of patients with chronic pain who are typically high utilizers. During clinic encounters, families mentioned that less stress from school, reduced respiratory infections, and better medication adherence with parents at home, were possible contributors to reduced sickle cell symptoms while sheltering in place. These observations will guide the development of a patient survey with the goal of obtaining qualitative data to explain the reasons for decreased utilization during the pandemic.

CKD has been associated with increased mortality in previous epidemics, and male sex has been correlated with worse outcomes during COVID-19 in the general population. Our aim was to describe the differential effect of sex as a risk factor for in-hospital mortality among non-dialysis CKD subjects. METHOD: Multicenter, observational cohort study including 136 adult patients with CKD and 136 age- and sex-matched controls who required admission for COVID-19 in three academic hospitals in Spain. Viral infection was confirmed by real-time RT-qPCR and/or serologic testing in all cases. Disease severity on admission was classified according to the WHO—China Joint Mission Report on COVID-19. The presence of CKD was defined as sustained eGFR <60 and >15 ml/min/1.73m2 within the 6 months prior to COVID-19 hospitalization. Demographic and clinical data were gathered from medical records. Outcomes were recorded during the following 28 days after admission. We applied Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes and severe or critical disease at presentation. RESULTS: Due to the matched design, no differences were found regarding age and sex between cohorts. CKD patients suffered more frequently from hypertension and diabetes and presented higher 28-day mortality after hospital admission due to COVID-19 compared with age- and sex-matched controls (40.4 vs. 24.3%; P=0.004). In adjusted Cox regression analysis among CKD patients, only age (HR: 1.087, 95% CI: 1.047-1.128) and male sex (HR: 1.883, 95% CI: 1.045-3.391) were independent predictors of 28-day mortality. Comparatively, among patients without CKD, only age acted as an independent predictor for 28-day mortality (HR: 1.082, 95% CI: 1.033-1.133). None of the variables included in adjusted regression was able to predict ICU admission in any of the cohorts. CONCLUSION: Male sex is associated with increased mortality, but not with ICU admission, after hospitalization due to COVID-19 among non-dialysis CKD patients. That effect was not observed among hospitalized controls without CKD.","Coca, Armando; Burballa, Carla; Centellas Pérez, Francisco Javier; Acosta-Ochoa, Isabel; Arenas, María Dolores; Pérez Martínez, Juan; Fidalgo, Veronica; Pascual, Julio; Ortega Cerrato, Agustin",Nephrol Dial Transplant,294,1

Traditional mechanisms of commissioning research are ill-suited to guide policy during a rapidly evolving pandemic. At the same time, contracting with a single centre of expertise has been criticized for failing to reflect challenges inherent in specific modelling approaches. INTERVENTION: This report describes an alternative approach to mobilizing scientific expertise. Ontario’s COVID-19 Modelling Consensus Table (MCT) was created in March 2020 to enable rapid communication of credible estimates of the impact of COVID-19 and to accelerate learning on how the disease is spreading and what could slow its transmission. The MCT is a partnership between the province and academic modellers and consists of multiple groups of experts, health system leaders, and senior decision-makers. Armed with Ministry of Health data, the MCT meets once per week to share results from modelling exercises, generate consensus judgements of the likely future impact of COVID-19, and discuss decision-makers’ priorities. OUTCOMES: The MCT has enabled swift access to data for participants, a structure for developing consensus estimates and communicating these to decision-makers, credible models to inform health system planning, and increased transparency in public reporting of COVID-19 data. It has also facilitated the rapid publication of research findings and its incorporation into government policy. IMPLICATIONS: The MCT approach is one way to quickly draw on scientific advice outside of government and public health agencies. Beyond speed, this approach allows for nimbleness as experts from different organizations can be added as needed. It also shows how universities and research institutes have a role to play in crisis situations, and how this expertise can be marshalled to inform policy while respecting academic freedom and confidentiality.","Hillmer, Michael P.; Feng, Patrick; McLaughlin, John R.; Murty, V.

Sensitivity of RT-PCR nasopharyngeal (NP) testing is presumed to be high, but there is no gold standard against which this has been determined. The objective was to determine whether lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), occurs in the absence of upper respiratory tract infection with clinical testing of both specimen types. METHODS: Between March 26, 2020 and April 17, 2020 at the University of Washington Medical Center all patients with BALF specimens clinically tested for SARS-CoV-2 were identified. We assessed the proportion of patients with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in BALF after negative NP testing. We describe 3 cases with positive testing in BALF. RESULTS: Among 16 patients with BALF samples, 3 cases (19%) had SARS-CoV-2 detected in BALF. In Case 1, negative NP testing occurred early in the infection and respiratory symptoms may have been missed due to neurologic injury. In Case 2, outpatient diagnosis was aspiration pneumonia, but clinical suspicion remained high for COVID-19 at hospitalization based on epidemiological and clinical features. All 3 cases involved older adults (age >65 years), one of whom was immunosuppressed in the setting of lung transplantation (Case 3). CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 LRTI occurs in the presence of negative NP testing. NP testing may underestimate the prevalence of COVID-19 and has implications for spread of SARS-CoV2 in the community and healthcare setting.","Ramos, Kathleen J.; Kapnadak, Siddhartha G.; Collins, Bridget F.; Pottinger, Paul S.; Wall, Richard; Mays, James A.; Perchetti, Garrett A.; Jerome, Keith R.; Khot, Sandeep; Limaye, Ajit P.; Mathias, Patrick C.; Greninger, Alexander",Respir Med Case Rep,294,16

While pandemic‐related stress has also been linked to increased insomnia, scarce research has examined this association in nationally representative samples of high‐risk populations, such as military veterans. We evaluated pre‐ and pandemic‐related factors associated with new‐onset and exacerbated insomnia symptoms in a nationally representative sample of 3,078 US military veterans who participated in the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study. Veterans were surveyed in the USA in 11/2019 (pre‐pandemic) and again in 11/2020 (peri‐pandemic). The Insomnia Severity Index was used to assess severity of insomnia symptoms at the pre‐ and peri‐pandemic assessments. Among veterans without clinical or subthreshold insomnia symptoms pre‐pandemic (n = 2,548), 11.5% developed subthreshold (10.9%) or clinical insomnia symptoms (0.6%) during the pandemic; among those with subthreshold insomnia symptoms pre‐pandemic (n = 1,058; 26.0%), 8.0% developed clinical insomnia symptoms.

Among the entire cohort, concern regarding COVID-19 was positively correlated with the occurrence of somatic symptoms. Somatic symptoms were more likely among college students expressing greater concern regarding the threat to life and health posed by COVID-19, and the efficacy of prevention and control measures. Among primary school students, only the concern for life and health was associated with a higher likelihood of somatic symptoms.

This research examined how individuals higher in perfectionism experienced missed and gained events during the pandemic, and how their perceptions of these events influenced their mental health. University students (N = 350) were surveyed in September 2020, assessing perfectionism, depression, missed/gained events, and need satisfaction related to these events, and then followed up in December. A combined missed and gained event score was created to better understand overall need satisfaction from these changes. Individuals higher in self-critical perfectionism were more likely to experience need dissatisfaction overall and this partially explained why these individuals experienced more depressive symptoms over time during the pandemic. Conversely, those higher in personal standards perfectionism experienced more need satisfaction overall and this was related to reduced depressive symptoms. Results suggest that individuals higher in self-critical perfectionism were less flexible when things did not go according to their plan. This may be one reason these individuals had a more difficult time coping during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Levine, Shelby L.; Andrade, Giovanni; Koestner, Richard",Pers Individ Dif,294,16

The advent of vaccinations heralded the turning of the tide. The Oxford jab, a vector-based vaccine was favoured due to its low cost and ease of storage. However, its potential association with thromboembolic adverse events resulted in controversy and disrupted its roll-out and use. The aetiopathogenesis of these thromboembolic events and its association with the Oxford vaccine are still speculative and uncertain, more so in the background of SARS-CoV-2 infection being highly thrombogenic in its own right. This paper presents a case of an otherwise healthy 50-year-old Caucasian man who developed acute abdominal pain 7 days following the first dose of Oxford vaccine and was found to have coeliac and splenic artery thrombosis complicated with splenic infarction.","Bandapaati, Sareesh; Bobba, Hemababu; Navinan, Mitrakrishnan Rayno",BMJ Case Rep,294,16

After having recently updated the vital status and mortality data in our exercise population (CLINIMEX cohort), we hypothesized that reviewing their evaluation reports would offer a unique opportunity to unearth some relevant information about the association between selected variables assessed in our comprehensive Exercise Medicine evaluation protocol; in particular, aerobic and musculoskeletal (MUSK) fitness, clinical variables, and death due to COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective study using data from the CLINIMEX cohort that included 6,101 non-athletic men and women aged >30 years who were alive as of March 12th, 2020 and who's vital status was followed up to December 14th, 2020. For data analysis, two approaches were used: 1) comparison of frequency of deaths and relative % of underlying causes of death between the last 18-months pre-pandemic and 9-month pandemic periods; and 2) data from 51 variables from the participant's most recent evaluation, including sex, age and clinical profile plus other variables obtained from physical examination, spirometry, (MUSK) fitness (e.g., sitting-rising test) and maximal cycling leg cardiopulmonary testing (e.g. maximal VO2 and cardiorespiratory optimal point) were selected for comparison between groups of non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 deaths. Results: Age at death varied from 51 to 102 years [mean = 80 years]. Only 4 participants that died, 3 COVID-19 and 1 non-COVID-19, were healthy at the time of their evaluation [p=.52]. COVID-19 was the most frequent (n=35; 36.5%) cause among the 96 deaths during this 9-month period. Comparing pre-pandemic and pandemic periods, there was a 35% increase in deaths and proportionately fewer deaths due to neoplasia and other causes but not from cardiovascular or endocrine diseases. Results of aerobic and MUSK fitness tests indicated that the majority of the study participants were relatively unfit when compared to available age and sex-reference values. Indeed, there were few differences in the 51 selected variables between the two groups, suggesting a somewhat healthier profile among COVID-19 death participants; lower body mass index [p=.04], higher % of predicted forced vital capacity [p=.04], lower number of previous percutaneous coronary interventions [p=.04] and lower resting supine diastolic blood pressure [p=.03], with no differences for aerobic/MUSK fitness variables or past history of exercise/sports [p>.05]. Conclusion: Our data support that COVID-19 was a frequent and premature cause of death in a convenience sample of primarily white, unhealthy, middle-age and elderly individuals and that data from exercise/sport history and physical fitness testing obtained some years earlier were unable to distinguish non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 deaths.","Araujo, C.

Indeed, low vaccination coverage among HCWs can lead to dangerous outbreaks of disease, reduce productivity, and increase absenteeism. The aim of this study was to investigate the vaccine coverage and attitudes toward vaccination among HCWs. Methods: A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs referred to all hospitals of the Local Health Authority 02 of Abruzzo Region, Italy. The survey was based on the questionnaire proposed by the H-ProImmune Project. Results: A total of 347 HCWs were enrolled in the study. Of these, 57.3% reported missing diphtheritis-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccination, 50.1% reported missing measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination, and 62.5% reported missing flu vaccination. Regarding attitudes, other healthcare professionals reported to believe more in natural immunization compared to vaccination (26.5%; p < 0.001), and they were worried about long-term effects of vaccination (10.2%; p = 0.044). Conclusions: This survey showed all vaccination coverage considered resulted below the 95% threshold.

There have been many pandemics caused by various viruses throughout the world over the years. Recently, the global outbreak of COVID-19 has had a catastrophic impact on human health and the world economy. Antiviral drug treatment has become another essential means to overcome pandemics in addition to vaccine development. How to quickly find effective drugs that can control the development of a pandemic is a hot issue that still needs to be resolved in medical research today. To accelerate the development of drugs, it is necessary to target the key target proteins in the development of the pandemic, screen active molecules, and develop reliable methods for the identification and characterization of target proteins based on the active ingredients of drugs. This article discusses key target proteins and their biological mechanisms in the progression of COVID-19 and other major epidemics. We propose a model based on these foundations, which includes identifying potential core targets, screening potential active molecules of core targets, and verifying active molecules. This article summarizes the related innovative technologies and methods. We hope to provide a reference for the screening of drugs related to pandemics and the development of new drugs.","Yu, Hongxin; Li, Chunyan; Wang, Xing; Duan, Jingyi; Yang, Na; Xie, Lijuan; Yuan, Yu; Li, Shanze; Bi, Chenghao; Yang, Bin; Li, Yubo",J Proteome Res,294,30

This study aimed to determine the extent to which the 24-h allocation of time to different physical behaviors changes between days working at the office (WAO) and days WFH in office workers during the pandemic. METHODS: Data were collected on 27 office workers with full-time employment at a Swedish municipal division during the COVID-19 outbreak in May–July 2020. A thigh-worn accelerometer (Axivity) was used to assess physical behavior (sedentary, stand, move) during seven consecutive days. A diary was used to identify periods of work, leisure and sleep. 24-h compositions of sedentary, standing and moving behaviors during work and non-work time were examined using Compositional data analysis (CoDA), and differences between days WAO and days WFH were determined using repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Days WFH were associated with more time spent sleeping relative to awake, and the effect size was large (F = 7.4; p = 0.01; η(p)(2) = 0.22). The increase (34 min) in sleep time during WFH occurred at the expense of a reduction in work and leisure time by 26 min and 7 min, respectively. Sedentary, standing and moving behaviors did not change markedly during days WFH compared to days WAO. CONCLUSION: Days working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden were associated with longer duration of sleep than days working at the office. This behavioral change may be beneficial to health.

This was attributed to communal living in high-density and unhygienic dormitory settings and a lack of inclusive protection systems. However, little is known about the roles of social and geospatial networks in COVID-19 transmission. The study examined the networks of nonwork-related activities among migrant workers to inform the development of lockdown exit strategies and future pandemic preparedness. METHODS: A population-based survey was conducted with 509 migrant workers across the nation, and it assessed dormitory attributes, social ties, physical and mental health status, COVID-19-related variables, and mobility patterns using a grid-based network questionnaire. Mobility paths from dormitories were presented based on purposes of visit. Two-mode social networks examined the structures and positions of networks between workers and visit areas with individual attributes. RESULTS: COVID-19 risk exposure was associated with the density of dormitory, social ties, and visit areas. The migrant worker hub in the city center was the most frequently visited for essential services of grocery shopping and remittance, followed by southcentral areas mainly for social gathering. The hub was positioned as the core with the highest degree of centrality with a cluster of workers exposed to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Social and geospatial networks of migrant workers should be considered in the implementation of lockdown exit strategies while addressing the improvement of living conditions and monitoring systems. Essential services, like remittance and grocery shopping at affordable prices, need to be provided near to dormitories to minimize excess gatherings.","Yi, Huso; Ng, Shu Tian; Farwin, Aysha; Low, Pei Ting Amanda; Chang, Cheng Mun; Lim, Jeremy",J Travel Med,294,16

Retrospective cohort study with patients evaluated for COVID-19 pneumonia in the ED, from March 3 to April 30, 2020. All of them were discharged home and controlled by HH. The main outcomes were ED revisit and the need for deferred hospital admission (protocol failure). Outcome predictors were analyzed by simple logistic regression model (OR; 95% CI). Potential savings of this medical care model were estimated. Of the 377 patients attended in the ED, 109 were identified as having mild pneumonia and were included in the ED/HH medical care model. Median age was 50.0 years, 52.3% were males and 57.8% had Charlson index ≥ 1. The median HH stay was 8 (IQR 3.7–11) days.

We illustrate this using a mathematical model that segments the vulnerable population and their closest contacts, the ‘shielders’. Effects of extending the duration of lockdown and faster or slower transition to post-lockdown conditions and, most importantly, the trade-off between increased protection of the vulnerable segment and fewer restrictions on the general population are explored. Our study shows that the most important determinants of outcome are: (i) post-lockdown transmission rates within the general and between the general and vulnerable segments; (ii) fractions of the population in the vulnerable and shielder segments; (iii) adherence to protective measures; and (iv) build-up of population immunity. Additionally, we found that effective measures in the shielder segment, e.g. intensive routine screening, allow further relaxations in the general population. We find that the outcome of any future policy is strongly influenced by the contact matrix between segments and the relationships between physical distancing measures and transmission rates. This strategy has potential applications for any infectious disease for which there are defined proportions of the population who cannot be treated or who are at risk of severe outcomes.

Here, we employed the detailed clinical, immunological and multi-omics data of the Human Functional Genomics Projects (HFGP) to explore the physiological significance of the host genetic variants that influence susceptibility to severe COVID-19. A functional genomics investigation based on functional characterization of individuals with high genetic risk for severe COVID-19 susceptibility identified several major patterns: i. a large impact of genetically determined innate immune responses in COVID-19, with increased susceptibility for severe disease in individuals with defective monocyte-derived cytokine production; ii. genetic susceptibility related to ABO blood groups is probably mediated through the von Willebrand factor (VWF) and endothelial dysfunction; and iii. the increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 in men is at least partially mediated by chromosome X-mediated genetic variation. These insights allow a physiological understanding of genetic susceptibility to severe COVID-19, and indicate pathways that could be targeted for prevention and therapy.","Kuijpers, Y.; Chu, X.; Jaeger, M.; Moorlag, S.; Koeken, V.; Mourits, V.; J. de Bree, L.

The current research is an attempt to develop and validate a tool to document falsified hand sanitizer in the UAE community. METHOD: A descriptive cross-sectional community-based study was conducted among 1280 randomly selected participants. Respondents were sent a web-based electronic link to the survey via email. Content validity, factor analyses and known group validity were used to develop and validate a new scale to identify falsified hand sanitizer. Test-retest reliability, internal consistency, item internal consistency (IIC), and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess the reliability of the scale. SPSS version 24 was used to conduct data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1280 participants were enrolled in the study. The content validity index (CVI) was 0.83 with the final scale of 12 items. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) value was 0.788, with the Bartlett test of sphericity achieving statistical significance (p < 0.001). Our factor analysis revealed a 3-component model. The 3-factor solution was confirmed by PCFA analysis and had associations with good fit values. The PCFA for NFI was 0.970, CFI 0.978, and TLI 0.967. All values were in excess of 0.95, with RMSEA values below 0.06 at 0.03; all of these values indicated a good model fit. The Cronbach’s alpha was good overall (0.867). All factors had a Cronbach’s alpha value in excess of 0.70. The instrument demonstrated that every item met the IIC correlation standard ≥0.40. The scale displayed good overall ICC statistics of 0.867 (95% CI 0.856–0.877) with statistical significance (p < 0.001). The scale’s test-retest reliability was assessed through correlation of the falsified hand sanitizer identification score of respondents at the two time points. The test-retest correlation coefficient was 0.770 (p value < 0.01). Participants with post-graduate education were more likely to identify the falsified hand sanitizer compared to those with high school education. (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study developed and validated a new scale for the measurement of falsified hand sanitizer. This is expected to improve and promote collaboration between the health regulators and the public and hereby encourage customer satisfaction and participation.","Jairoun, Ammar Abdulrahman; Al-Hemyari, Sabaa Saleh; Shahwan, Moyad; El-Dahiyat, Faris; Jamshed, Shazia",BMC Public Health,294,2

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate clinical applicability of multiplex real-time PCR. STUDY DESIGN: An assay targeting influenza virus A (IfA) and B (IfB), parainfluenza 1-3 (PIV), human metapneumovirus (MPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), enterovirus (EV), adenovirus (AdV), human coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63), M. pneumoniae and Ch. pneumoniae was developed and run daily on consecutive clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples. RESULTS: An etiology was identified in 48% of the 954 samples, with IfA in 25%, RV in 20%, MPV in 10% and M. pneumoniae in 10% of the positive. By a rational procedure costs could be reduced and the customer price set relatively low (€33 per sample). CONCLUSION: Streamlined testing and cost limitation is achievable and probably critical for implementation of a broad molecular diagnostics of respiratory infections.","Brittain-Long, Robin; Nord, Sandra; Olofsson, Sigvard; Westin, Johan; Anderson, Lars-Magnus; Lindh, Magnus",J Clin Virol,294,16

The second and main aim is to review and recommend that the concept (and measurement) of “emotional availability” may provide a new window in this continued exploration. Emotional availability (EA) refers to the capacity of a dyad to share an emotionally healthy relationship. The EA Scales assess this construct using a multi-dimensional framework, with a method to measure the affect and behavior of both the child and adult partner (caregiver). In this review, we first provide an overview of child development research, with regards to stress physiology, neuroendocrine system, genetics and epigenetics, and brain mechanisms. We then summarize the results of specific EA research in these areas, and propose a theoretical model integrating these constructs. Finally, we offer areas for future research in this area.","Clark, Emma L. M.; Jiao, Yuqin; Sandoval, Karen; Biringen, Zeynep",Brain Sci,294,5

Up to 24 pm, 25 January 2020, a total of 1975 cases of 2019‐nCoV infection were confirmed in mainland China with a total of 56 deaths having occurred. The latest mortality was approximately 2.84% with a total of 2684 cases still suspected. The China National Health Commission reported the details of the first 17 deaths up to 24 pm, 22 January 2020. The deaths included 13 males and 4 females. The median age of the people who died was 75 (range 48‐89) years. Fever (64.7%) and cough (52.9%) were the most common first symptoms among those who died.

To date, ∼463,000 people died worldwide due to this disease. Several attempts have been taken in search of effective drugs to control the spread of SARS CoV-2 infection. The main protease (Mpro) from SARS CoV-2 plays a vital role in viral replication and thus serves as an important drug target. This Mpro shares a high degree of sequence similarity (>96%) with the same protease from SARS CoV-1 and MERS. It was already reported that Broussonetia papyrifera polyphenols efficiently inhibit the catalytic activity of SARS CoV-1 and MERS Mpro. But whether these polyphenols exhibit any inhibitory effect on SARS CoV-2 Mpro is far from clear. To understand this fact, here we have adopted computational approaches. Polyphenols having proper drug-likeness properties and two repurposed drugs (lopinavir and darunavir; having binding affinity −7.3 to −7.4 kcal/mol) were docked against SARS CoV-2 Mpro to study their binding properties. Only six polyphenols (broussochalcone A, papyriflavonol A, 3'-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-3',4',7-trihydroxyflavane, broussoflavan A, kazinol F and kazinol J) had interaction with both the catalytic residues (His41 and Cys145) of Mpro and exhibited good binding affinity (−7.6 to −8.2 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamic simulations (100 ns) revealed that all Mpro-polyphenol complexes are more stable, conformationally less fluctuated; slightly less compact and marginally expanded than Mpro-darunavir/lopinavir complex. Even the number of intermolecular H-bond and MM-GBSA analysis suggested that these six polyphenols are more potent Mpro inhibitors than the two repurposed drugs (lopinavir and darunavir) and may serve as promising anti-COVID-19 drugs.

(2012) Prevention of influenza among travellers attending at a UK travel clinic: beliefs and perceptions. A cross‐sectional study. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 7(4), 574–583. Background Travellers’ compliance with measures to prevent influenza through the use of antivirals and influenza vaccine remains very poor despite influenza being one of the commonest travel and vaccine‐preventable diseases. A study was undertaken to assess travellers’ beliefs, perceptions and intentions to take antivirals for the treatment and prevention of influenza during the H1N1 pandemic. Methods A cross‐sectional survey (n = 96) of travellers who attended the Royal Free Travel Health Centre, London, UK was undertaken in September 2009. A self‐administered questionnaire was completed by a traveller in advance of their pre‐travel health consultation. Logistic regression identified variables independently associated with compliance. Results Influenza vaccination uptake for the 5 years preceding the study was found to be 20·8%. This was statistically significantly higher for older travellers and those with underlying health conditions (P < 0·005). Mean intention to comply with antiviral drugs on a preventive and therapeutic basis was 58% and 72%, respectively, and this varied markedly with age and with dispensed antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Conclusion This study identifies some beliefs and perceptions travellers consider with regard to the therapeutic and preventive influenza use of antivirals during the H1N1 pandemic; it underscores the importance of travellers receiving hemisphere appropriate influenza vaccination. The external validity of these study findings requires further corroboration involving other travel clinics and different cohorts of travellers during seasonal activity or outbreaks of influenza. These findings could guide the development of future strategies for the prevention of influenza in travellers.","Masuet‐Aumatell, Cristina; Toovey, Stephen; Zuckerman, Jane N.",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,294,1

The reason for the recurrent positivity of the test and the potential public health concern due to this occurrence are still unknown. Here, we analyzed the viral data and clinical manifestations of 289 domestic Chinese COVID-19 patients and found that 21 individuals (7.3%) were readmitted for hospitalization after detection of SARS-CoV-2 after discharge. First, we experimentally confirmed that the virus was involved in the initial infection and was not a secondary infection. In positive retests, the virus was usually found in anal samples (15 of 21, 71.4%). Through analysis of the intracellular viral subgenomic messenger RNA (sgmRNA), we verified that positive retest patients had active viral replication in their gastrointestinal tracts (3 of 16 patients, 18.7%) but not in their respiratory tracts. Then, we found that viral persistence was not associated with high viral titers, delayed viral clearance, old age, or more severe clinical symptoms during the first hospitalization. In contrast, viral rebound was associated with significantly lower levels of and slower generation of viral receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgA and IgG antibodies. Our study demonstrated that the positive retest patients failed to create a robust protective humoral immune response, which might result in SARS-CoV-2 persistence in the gastrointestinal tract and possibly in active viral shedding. Further exploration of the mechanism underlying the rebound in SARS-CoV-2 in this population will be crucial for preventing virus spread and developing effective vaccines.","Hu, Fengyu; Chen, Fengjuan; Ou, Zhihua; Fan, Qinghong; Tan, Xinghua; Wang, Yaping; Pan, Yuejun; Ke, Bixia; Li, Linghua; Guan, Yujuan; Mo, Xiaoneng; Wang, Jian; Wang, Jinlin; Luo, Chun; Wen, Xueliang; Li, Min; Ren, Peidi; Ke, Changwen; Li, Junhua; Lei, Chunliang; Tang, Xiaoping; Li, Feng",Cell Mol Immunol,294,20

Countries have adopted Non-pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) to slow down the spread. This study proposes an Agent Based Model that simulates the spread of COVID-19 among the inhabitants of a city. The Agent Based Model can be accommodated for any location by integrating parameters specific to the city. The simulation gives the number of daily confirmed cases. Considering each person as an agent susceptible to COVID-19, the model causes infected individuals to transmit the disease via various actions performed every hour. The model is validated by comparing the simulation to the real data of Ford county, Kansas, USA. Different interventions including contact tracing are applied on a scaled down version of New York city, USA and the parameters that lead to a controlled epidemic are determined. Our experiments suggest that contact tracing via smartphones with more than 60% of the population owning a smartphone combined with a city-wide lock-down results in the effective reproduction number (Rt) to fall below 1 within three weeks of intervention. In the case of 75% or more smartphone users, new infections are eliminated and the spread is contained within three months of intervention. Contact tracing accompanied with early lock-down can suppress the epidemic growth of COVID-19 completely with sufficient smartphone owners. In places where it is difficult to ensure a high percentage of smartphone ownership, tracing only emergency service providers during a lock-down can go a long way to contain the spread. No particular funding was available for this project.","Shamil, M. S.; Farheen, F.; Ibtehaz, N.; Khan, I. M.; Rahman, M. S.",,294,21

Methods RT-qPCR assays and molecular sequencing methods were used to identify HRV and HEV strains in nasopharyngeal aspirates of 309 hospitalized pediatric patients with microbiologically unexplained ARTIs and in 210 hospitalized pediatric patients without respiratory symptoms from September 2009 to June 2010 in France. Results Among the 309 ARTI cases, 15 HEV and 172 HRV strains were identified whereas only 1 HEV and 37 HRV strains were observed in control patients (187 vs. 38: P < 10−3). HRV strains were identified in 150 of the 164 lower ARTIs whereas HEV strains were identified in only 14 of these cases. Among bronchiolitis and asthma exacerbation cases (n = 133), HEV infected cases were older (Median age (months) 36 vs. 11, P = 0.003) and were more frequently associated with a respiratory distress (P = 0.01) and a need for oxygen supply at the time of admission (P = 0.01) than cases infected by HRV strains. Conclusion HRV and HEV strains were identified as potential etiological causes of 60.5% of microbiologically unexplained ARTIs diagnosed in hospitalized pediatric cases. A higher clinical severity was observed in HEV infected bronchiolitis or asthma exacerbation cases in comparison to HRV infected cases.","Renois, Fanny; Lévêque, Nicolas; Deliège, Pierre-Guillaume; Fichel, Caroline; Bouin, Alexis; Abely, Michel; N'Guyen, Yohan; Andréoletti, Laurent",Journal of Infection,294,1

It is proposed that the emergence of those cations in DNICs is related to disproportionation reaction of NO molecules, initiated by their binding with Fe(2+) ions (two NO molecules per one ion). At the same time, possible hydrolysis of iron-bound nitrosonium cations is prevented by the electron density transition to nitrosonium cations from sulfur atoms of thiol-containing ligands, which are included in the coordination sphere of iron. It allows supposing that iron in iron–nitrosyl complexes of DNICs has a d(7) electronic configuration. This supposition is underpinned by experimental data revealing that a half of nitrosyl ligands are converted into S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs) when those complexes decompose, with the other half of those ligands released in the form of neutral NO molecules.","Vanin, Anatoly F.",Appl Magn Reson,294,18

Several models have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, but all of them implicitly assume that the process of virus replication itself does not contribute to genetic drift. We developed an assay to measure the amount of genetic drift for HIV populations replicating in cell culture. The assay relies on creation of HIV populations of known size and measurements of variation in frequency of a neutral allele. Using this assay, we show that HIV undergoes approximately ten times more genetic drift than would be expected from its population size, which we defined as the number of infected cells in the culture. We showed that a large portion of the increase in genetic drift is due to non-synchronous infection of target cells. When infections are synchronized, genetic drift for the virus is only 3-fold higher than expected from its population size. Thus, the stochastic nature of biological processes involved in viral replication contributes to increased genetic drift in HIV populations. We propose that appreciation of these effects will allow better understanding of the evolutionary forces acting on HIV in infected patients.","Voronin, Yegor; Holte, Sarah; Overbaugh, Julie; Emerman, Michael",PLoS Genet,294,5

The ARCHITECT™ SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay was initially optimized for use with DBS, venous and capillary plasma, and venous whole blood collected from patients with symptoms and PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and negative asymptomatic controls. Linearity and reproducibility was confirmed with 3 contrived DBS samples, along with sample stability and signal recovery after 14 days. ARCHITECT™ SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM assay results showed high concordance between fingerstick DBS and venous DBS samples, and between fingerstick DBS and venous whole blood samples (n=61). Fingerstick plasma collected in Microtainer tubes (n=109) showed 100% concordant results (R(2)=0.997) with matched patient venous plasma on the ARCHITECT™ SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. High concordance of assay results (92.9% positive, 100% negative) was also observed for the PANBIO™ SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay compared to the ARCHITECT™ SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay run with matched venous plasma (n=61).

This is realized by considering a Monte Carlo discrete version of the previous model coupled via a complex network. Then, we apply optimal control theory to maximize the number of people returning to “normal life” and minimizing the number of active infected individuals with minimal economical costs while warranting a low level of hospitalizations. This work allows testing various scenarios of pandemic management (closure of sectors of the economy, partial/total compliance with protection measures by citizens, number of beds in intensive care units, etc.), ensuring the responsiveness of the health system, thus being a public health decision support tool.","Silva, Cristiana J.; Cruz, Carla; Torres, Delfim F.
