98,Designing and conducting tabletop exercises to assess public health preparedness for manmade and naturally occurring biological threats,2007-05-29,"BACKGROUND: Since 2001, state and local health departments in the United States (US) have accelerated efforts to prepare for high-impact public health emergencies. One component of these activities has been the development and conduct of exercise programs to assess capabilities, train staff and build relationships. This paper summarizes lessons learned from tabletop exercises about public health emergency preparedness and about the process of developing, conducting, and evaluating them. METHODS: We developed, conducted, and evaluated 31 tabletop exercises in partnership with state and local health departments throughout the US from 2003 to 2006. Participant self evaluations, after action reports, and tabletop exercise evaluation forms were used to identify aspects of the exercises themselves, as well as public health emergency responses that participants found more or less challenging, and to highlight lessons learned about tabletop exercise design. RESULTS: Designing the exercises involved substantial collaboration with representatives from participating health departments to assure that the scenarios were credible, focused attention on local preparedness needs and priorities, and were logistically feasible to implement. During execution of the exercises, nearly all health departments struggled with a common set of challenges relating to disease surveillance, epidemiologic investigations, communications, command and control, and health care surge capacity. In contrast, performance strengths were more varied across participating sites, reflecting specific attributes of individual health departments or communities, experience with actual public health emergencies, or the emphasis of prior preparedness efforts. CONCLUSION: The design, conduct, and evaluation of the tabletop exercises described in this report benefited from collaborative planning that involved stakeholders from participating health departments and exercise developers and facilitators from outside the participating agencies. While these exercises identified both strengths and vulnerabilities in emergency preparedness, additional work is needed to develop reliable metrics to gauge exercise performance, inform follow-up action steps, and to develop re-evaluation exercise designs that assess the impact of post-exercise interventions.","Dausey, David J; Buehler, James W; Lurie, Nicole",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1894789/,69

3434,Evaluation of Data Exchange Process for Interoperability and Impact on Electronic Laboratory Reporting Quality to a State Public Health Agency,2018-09-21,"BACKGROUND: Past and present national initiatives advocate for electronic exchange of health data and emphasize interoperability. The critical role of public health in the context of disease surveillance was recognized with recommendations for electronic laboratory reporting (ELR). Many public health agencies have seen a trend towards centralization of information technology services which adds another layer of complexity to interoperability efforts. OBJECTIVES: The study objective was to understand the process of data exchange and its impact on the quality of data being transmitted in the context of electronic laboratory reporting to public health. This was conducted in context of Minnesota Electronic Disease Surveillance System (MEDSS), the public health information system for supporting infectious disease surveillance in Minnesota. Data Quality (DQ) dimensions by Strong et al., was chosen as the guiding framework for evaluation. METHODS: The process of assessing data exchange for electronic lab reporting and its impact was a mixed methods approach with qualitative data obtained through expert discussions and quantitative data obtained from queries of the MEDSS system. Interviews were conducted in an open-ended format from November 2017 through February 2018. Based on these discussions, two high level categories of data exchange process which could impact data quality were identified: onboarding for electronic lab reporting and internal data exchange routing. This in turn comprised of ten critical steps and its impact on quality of data was identified through expert input. This was followed by analysis of data in MEDSS by various criteria identified by the informatics team. RESULTS: All DQ metrics (Intrinsic DQ, Contextual DQ, Representational DQ, and Accessibility DQ) were impacted in the data exchange process with varying influence on DQ dimensions. Some errors such as improper mapping in electronic health records (EHRs) and laboratory information systems had a cascading effect and can pass through technical filters and go undetected till use of data by epidemiologists. Some DQ dimensions such as accuracy, relevancy, value-added data and interpretability are more dependent on users at either end of the data exchange spectrum, the relevant clinical groups and the public health program professionals. The study revealed that data quality is dynamic and on-going oversight is a combined effort by MEDSS Informatics team and review by technical and public health program professionals. CONCLUSION: With increasing electronic reporting to public health, there is a need to understand the current processes for electronic exchange and their impact on quality of data. This study focused on electronic laboratory reporting to public health and analyzed both onboarding and internal data exchange processes. Insights gathered from this research can be applied to other public health reporting currently (e.g. immunizations) and will be valuable in planning for electronic case reporting in near future.","Rajamani, Sripriya; Kayser, Ann; Emerson, Emily; Solarz, Sarah",Online J Public Health Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6194099/,69

17683,Without Assumptions: Development of a Socio-Emotional Learning Framework That Reflects Community Values in Cameroon,2021-05-07,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pyogenes causes a profound global burden of morbidity and mortality across its diverse clinical spectrum. To support a new controlled human infection (challenge) model seeking to accelerate S. pyogenes vaccine development, we aimed to develop an accurate and reliable molecular method for quantifying bacterial load from pharyngeal swabs collected during experimental human pharyngitis. METHODS: Combined sequential RNA+DNA extraction from throat swabs was compared to traditional separate RNA-only and DNA-only extractions. An emm-type specific qPCR was developed to detect the emm75 challenge strain. Results from the qPCR were compared to culture, using throat swab samples collected in a human challenge study. RESULTS: The qPCR was 100% specific for the emm75 challenge strain when tested against a panel of S. pyogenes emm-types and other respiratory pathogens. Combined RNA+ DNA extraction had similar yield to traditional separate extractions. The combined extraction method and emm75 qPCR had 98.8% sensitivity compared to culture for throat swabs collected from challenge study participants. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a reliable molecular method for measuring S. pyogenes bacterial load from throat swabs collected in a controlled human infection model of S. pyogenes pharyngitis.

Five key results were identified: (1) Overall, 13 different phenolic acids and flavonoids were detected from among the 20 excellent jujube varieties tested, of which 12 were from the fruits, 11 from the leaves, and 10 from the stems. Seven phenolic acids and flavonoids, including (+)-catechin, rutin, quercetin, luteolin, spinosin, gallic acid, and chlorogenic acid, were detected in all tissues. (2) The total and individual phenolic acids and flavonoids contents significantly decreased during fruit development in Ziziphus jujuba cv.Hupingzao. (3) The total phenolic acids and flavonoids content was the highest in the leaves of Ziziphus jujuba cv.Hupingzao, followed by the stems and fruits with significant differences among the content of these tissues. The main composition of the tissues also differed, with quercetin and rutin present in the leaves; (+)-catechin and rutin in the stems; and (+)-catechin, epicatechin, and rutin in the fruits. (4) The total content of phenolic acid and flavonoid ranged from 359.38 to 1041.33 μg/g FW across all examined varieties, with Ziziphus jujuba cv.Jishanbanzao having the highest content, and (+)-catechin as the main composition in all 20 varieties, followed by epicatechin, rutin, and quercetin.

24680,Population and Public Health,2018-12-20,"Despite the formidable progress in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, quality assessment of NMR-derived structures remains as an important problem. Thus, validation of protein structures is essential for the spectroscopists, since it could enable them to detect structural flaws and potentially guide their efforts in further refinement. Moreover, availability of accurate and efficient validation tools would help molecular biologists and computational chemists to evaluate quality of available experimental structures and to select a protein model which is the most suitable for a given scientific problem. The (13)C(α) nuclei are ubiquitous in proteins, moreover, their shieldings are easily obtainable from NMR experiments and represent a rich source of encoded structural information that makes (13)C(α) chemical shifts an attractive candidate for use in computational methods aimed at determination and validation of protein structures. In this chapter, the basis of a novel methodology of computing, at the quantum chemical level of theory, the (13)C(α) shielding for the amino acid residues in proteins is described. We also identify and examine the main factors affecting the (13)C(α)-shielding computation. Finally, we illustrate how the information encoded in the (13)C chemical shifts can be used for a number of applications, viz., from protein structure prediction of both α-helical and β-sheet conformations, to determination of the fraction of the tautomeric forms of the imidazole ring of histidine in proteins as a function of pH or to accurate detection of structural flaws, at a residue-level, in NMR-determined protein models.","Vila, Jorge A.; Arnautova, Yelena A.",Computational Methods to Study the Structure and Dynamics of Biomolecules and Biomolecular Processes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121069/,69

In this study, the surfactant SDS was used to artificially destroy the cell membrane of Corynebacterium glutamicum, increase the permeability of the cell membrane, and increase the ability of the strain to secrete L-isoleucine. This is the first time that surfactants have been applied to the fermentation of Corynebacterium glutamicum. Results indicated that after optimization, the output of L-isoleucine reached 43.67 g/L, which was 13.01% higher than that without sodium dodecyl sulfate. The yield of the by-products, such as valine, leucine, and alanine, was reduced by 72.30%, 64.30%, 71.70%, respectively.

To be able to measure these skills is important in the assessment of surgeons, as it enables constructive feedback during training. The aim of this study was to test the validity of an objective and automatic assessment method using motion analysis during a laparoscopic procedure on an animal organ. MATERIAL AND METHODS Experienced surgeons in laparoscopy (experts) and medical students (novices) performed a cholecystectomy on a porcine liver box model. The motions of the surgical tools were acquired and analyzed by 11 different motion-related metrics, i.e., a total of 19 metrics as eight of them were measured separately for each hand. We identified for which of the metrics the experts outperformed the novices. RESULTS In total, two experts and 28 novices were included. The experts achieved significantly better results for 13 of the 19 instrument motion metrics. CONCLUSIONS Expert performance is characterized by a low time to complete the cholecystectomy, high bimanual dexterity (instrument coordination), a limited amount of movement and low measurement of motion smoothness of the dissection instrument, and relatively high usage of the grasper to optimize tissue positioning for dissection.","Hofstad, Erlend Fagertun; Våpenstad, Cecilie; Bø, Lars Eirik; Langø, Thomas; Kuhry, Esther; Mårvik, Ronald",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/13645706.2017.1284131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28635403/,69

84320,Dealing With Harassment in Public Health.,2021,"Importance Many policies designed to stop the spread of COVID-19 address formal gatherings, such as workplaces and dining locations. Informal social gatherings are a potentially important mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but studying their role in transmission is challenged by data and methodological limitations; birthdays offer an opportunity to empirically quantify the potential role of small social gatherings in COVID-19 spread. Objective To assess the association between social gatherings and SARS-CoV-2 transmission by studying whether COVID-19 rates increase after birthdays in a household. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study used nationwide data from January 1 to November 8, 2020, from 2.9 million US households with private insurance to compare COVID-19 infections between households with and without a birthday in the preceding 2 weeks, stratified according to county-level COVID-19 prevalence in that week and adjusting for household size and both week- and county-specific differences. The study also compared how birthday-associated infection rates differed by type of birthday (eg, child vs adult birthday, or a milestone birthday such as a 50th birthday), county-level precipitation on the Saturday of each week (which could move gatherings indoors), political leanings in the county, and state shelter-in-place policies. Main Outcomes and Measures Household-level COVID-19 infection. Results Among the 2.9 million households in the study, in the top decile of counties in COVID-19 prevalence, households with a birthday in the 2 weeks prior had 8.6 more diagnoses per 10 000 individuals (95% CI, 6.6-10.7 per 10 000 individuals) compared with households without a birthday in the 2 weeks prior, a relative increase of 31% above the county-level prevalence of 27.8 cases per 10 000 individuals, vs 0.9 more diagnoses per 10 000 individuals (95% CI, 0.6-1.3 per 10 000 individuals) in the fifth decile (P < .001 for interaction). Households in the tenth decile of COVID-19 prevalence had an increase in COVID-19 diagnoses of 15.8 per 10 000 persons (95% CI, 11.7-19.9 per 10 000 persons) after a child birthday, compared with an increase of 5.8 per 10 000 persons (95% CI, 3.7-7.9 per 10 000 persons) among households with an adult birthday (P < .001 in a test of interactions). No differences were found by milestone birthdays, county political leaning, precipitation, or shelter-in-place policies. Conclusions and Relevance This cross-sectional study suggests that birthdays, which likely correspond with social gatherings and celebrations, were associated with increased rates of diagnosed COVID-19 infection within households in counties with high COVID-19 prevalence.","Whaley, Christopher M; Cantor, Jonathan; Pera, Megan; Jena, Anupam B",JAMA internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.2915; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34152363/,69

However, despite the benefits of the ERAS program on short-term results, little is known about its impact on long-term results. OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to determine the association between adherence to the ERAS protocol and long-term survival after laparoscopic colorectal resection for non-metastatic cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODOLOGY Between 2013 and 2016, 350 patients underwent laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection in the 2nd Department of General Surgery, Jagiellonian University Medical College, and were enrolled for further analysis. The relationship between the rate of compliance with the ERAS protocol and 3-year survival was analyzed according to the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank tests. Patients were divided into two groups according to their degree of adherence to the ERAS interventions: Group 1 (109 patients), < 80% adherence, and Group 2 (241 patients), ≥ 80% adherence. The primary outcome was overall 3-year survival. The secondary outcomes were postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and recovery parameters. RESULTS The groups were similar in terms of demographics and surgical parameters. The median compliance to ERAS interventions was 85.2%. The Cox proportional model showed that AJCC III (HR 3.28, 95% CI 1.61-6.59, p = 0.0021), postoperative complications (HR 2.63, 95% CI 1.19-5.52, p = 0.0161), and compliance with ERAS protocol < 80% (HR 3.38, 95% CI 2.23-5.21, p = 0.0102) were independent predictors for poor prognosis. Additionally, analysis revealed that adherence to the ERAS protocol in Group 2 with ≥ 80% adherence was associated with a significantly shorter length of hospital stay (6 vs. 4 days, p < 0.0001), a lower rate of postoperative complications (44.7% vs. 23.3%, p < 0.0001), and improved functional recovery parameters: tolerance of oral diet (53.4% vs. 81.5%, p < 0.0001) and mobilization (77.7% vs. 96.1%, p < 0.0001) on the first postoperative day. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study reports an association between adherence to the ERAS protocol and long-term survival after laparoscopic colorectal resection for non-metastatic cancer. Lower adherence to the protocol, independent from stage of cancer and postoperative complications, was an independent risk factors for poorer survival rates.","Pisarska, Magdalena; Torbicz, Grzegorz; Gajewska, Natalia; Rubinkiewicz, Mateusz; Wierdak, Mateusz; Major, Piotr; Budzyński, Andrzej; Ljungqvist, Olle; Pędziwiatr, Michał",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-019-05073-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31286185/,69

We aimed to provide a cross-sectional overview of current limitations or adaptions in lung transplant programs in Germany in from January to May 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. A cross-sectional survey assessing various aspects of lung transplant activity was sent to all active lung transplant programs (n = 12) in Germany. Eight centers (66%) responded to the survey within the requested time frame. Four centers (50%) reported their activity is not restricted at all and four centers (50%) reported on moderate general limitations. The overall lung transplant activity in Germany from January to May 2020 contains 128 bilateral and 11 single lung transplantations, which is similar to the same period in the year 2019 (126 bilateral transplantations and 12 single lung transplantations). The results suggest that the influence of the COVID-19 pandemia on lung transplantation activity in Germany has been moderate so far. Nevertheless, adaptions such as extensive testing of donors and recipients were introduced to reduce the likelihood of infections and increase patient safety.

97574,Foot and mouth disease: the risks of the international trade in live animals.,2017,"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) represent a dynamic regulatory system that precisely modulates the functional organization of synapses. PTMs consist in target modifications by small chemical moieties or conjugation of lipids, sugars or polypeptides. Among them, ubiquitin and a large family of ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) share several features such as the structure of the small protein modifiers, the enzymatic cascades mediating the conjugation process and the targeted aminoacidic residue. In the brain, ubiquitination and two UBLs, namely sumoylation and the recently discovered neddylation orchestrate fundamental processes including synapse formation, maturation and plasticity, and their alteration is thought to contribute to the development of neurological disorders. Remarkably, emerging evidence suggests that these pathways tightly interplay to modulate the function of several proteins that possess pivotal roles for brain homeostasis as well as failure of this crosstalk seems to be implicated in the development of brain pathologies. In this review, we outline the role of ubiquitination, sumoylation, neddylation and their functional interplay in synapse physiology and discuss their implication in the molecular pathogenesis of Intellectual Disability (ID), a neurodevelopmental disorder that is frequently co-morbid with a wide spectrum of brain pathologies. Finally, we propose a few outlooks that might contribute to better understand the complexity of these regulatory systems in regard to neuronal circuit pathophysiology.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Ubiquitination, sumoylation and neddylation are related PTMs modulating cellular and molecular pathways that are essential to generate fully functional neuronal circuits. Their impairment is indeed implicated in the pathogenesis of several disorders, including ID. Growing evidence now indicates they also functionally cooperate to govern synapse development and function. The main goals of this review are (i) to provide an overview of the current knowledge on the role of ubiquitination, sumoylation and neddylation in synapse functions; (ii) discuss how altered ubiquitination or sumoylation pathways may contribute to ID development; (iii) highlight evidence of a dynamic crosstalk between these PTMs, which represent a novel mechanism that could lead to the identification of new principles underlying synaptic function and dysfunction in ID.","Folci, Alessandra; Mirabella, Filippo; Fossati, Matteo",eNeuro,https://doi.org/10.1523/eneuro.0137-20.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719102/,69

103351,Proficiency testing and ring trials.,2021-06-01,"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a fatal human prion disease. Surveillance systems operate globally with the goals of accurate in-life case ascertainment, appropriate public health interventions to minimise secondary transmission, and monitoring trends in disease epidemiology. The UK experienced the highest incidence of variant CJD (vCJD) in the world following widespread population exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). 178 cases of vCJD have been identified in the UK by the National CJD Research & Surveillance Unit (NCJDRSU), including three cases of secondary transmission via blood transfusion. The NCJDRSU performs high-fidelity surveillance, assessing all cases of suspected CJD referred to the unit. COVID-19 has caused widespread disruption to healthcare and poses a threat to services. The NCJDRSU converted to telehealth-based surveillance in March 2020. We report the results of the application of telehealth for comprehensive CJD surveillance during the first four months of the pandemic. 59 cases were assessed for suspected CJD. In 52 cases the relatives were interviewed for an informant history, by video conference or telephone call. 34 patients underwent video examination; 1 case was examined in-person. MRI images were assessed in all cases and 46 underwent CSF testing.

104690,"Response by Hopkins and Holmes to Letter Regarding Article, ""Public Health Urgency Created by the Success of Mechanical Thrombectomy Studies in Stroke"".",2017,"BACKGROUND The scientific evidence concerning pathogenesis and immunopathology of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly evolving in the literature. To evaluate the different tissues obtained by biopsy and autopsy from five patients who expired from severe COVID-19 in our medical center. METHODS This retrospective study reviewed five patients with severe COVID-19, confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and imaging, to determine the potential correlations between histologic findings with patient outcome. RESULTS Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and micro-thrombosis were the most common histologic finding in the lung tissues (4 of 5 cases), and immunohistochemical (IHC) findings (3 of 4 cases) suggested perivascular aggregation and diffuse infiltration of alveolar walls by CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Two of five cases had mild predominantly perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, single cell myocardial necrosis and variable interstitial edema in myocardial samples. Hypertrophic cardiac myocytes, representing hypertensive cardiomyopathy was seen in one patient and CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were detected on IHC in two cases. In renal samples, acute tubular necrosis was observed in 3 of 5 cases, while chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, crescent formation and small vessel fibrin thrombi were observed in 1 of 5 samples. Sinusoidal dilation, mild to moderate chronic portal inflammation and mild mixed macro- and micro-vesicular steatosis were detected in all liver samples. CONCLUSION Our observations suggest that clinical pathology findings on autopsy tissue samples could shed more light on the pathogenesis, and consequently the management, of patients with severe COVID-19.","Bidari Zerehpoosh, Farahnaz; Sabeti, Shahram; Bahrami-Motlagh, Hooman; Mokhtari, Majid; Naghibi Irvani, Seyed Sina; Torabinavid, Parham; Esmaeili Tarki, Farzad; Amirdosara, Mahdi; Rezaei, Omidvar; Mostafazadeh, Babak; Hajiesmaeili, Mohammadreza; Rabiei, Mohammad Mahdi; Alavi Darazam, Ilad",Archives of Iranian medicine,https://doi.org/10.34172/aim.2021.23; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33636984/,69
108024,"Cost of Tuberculosis Therapy Directly Observed on Video for Health Departments and Patients in New York City; San Francisco, California; and Rhode Island (2017-2018).",2020-09-17,"BACKGROUND Before the discovery of immunological and haematological functions of the spleen, it had for centuries been considered to be a digestive organ of variable size with a role in the portal vein system and nutritional metabolism. In the 19th and 20th centuries, volume changes in the spleen related to nutrition were studied using plethysmographic measurements. Rhythmical and regulatory functions of the spleen were demonstrated in the haemodynamics of the splanchnic region and were described as a ""hepatolienal pendulum,"" a ""Windkessel function,"" or a ""pressure compensation."" These studies were mainly published in German-speaking countries and have not, as far as is known, been discussed in the English-speaking world so far. SUMMARY This review explores the historical development of the rhythmical regulatory function of the spleen in the splanchnic region. Older studies and results are followed up in the modern literature, wherever possible, up to the present. The clinical relevance is illustrated with portal hypertension (with congestive or hyperdynamic splenomegaly), coeliac disease, and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (with functional hyposplenism). Key Message: The spleen's rhythmical regulatory function in nutrition is based on an autonomous rhythm comprising cycles of contractions and dilations of the spleen of around 1 min. These cycles can be influenced by sympathetically mediated single contractions with a release of pooled blood or by portal vein congestion. After food ingestion, the spleen responds either with contraction according to a vasomotor reaction or postprandial congestion with significant increases in volume. The spleen's rhythmical function is lost in the clinical picture of portal hypertension or in coeliac disease and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. In the aforementioned gastrointestinal diseases, we recommend taking more account of the haemodynamics between the spleen, liver, and intestine. New innovative techniques for recording splenograms are required which, besides elastographic measurements of spleen stiffness, could offer an important tool for early detection, diagnosis, and therapeutic evaluation.","Weinzirl, Johannes; Garnitschnig, Lydia; Scheffers, Tom; Andrae, Lukas; Heusser, Peter",Digestion,https://doi.org/10.1159/000507346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408299/,69
121379,Public health round-up.,2019,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Neurologic morbidity remains high in neonates with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury despite therapeutic hypothermia. DTI provides qualitative and quantitative information about the microstructure of the brain, and a near-infrared spectroscopy index can assess cerebrovascular autoregulation. We hypothesized that lower ADC values would correlate with worse autoregulatory function. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-one neonates with hypoxic-ischemic injury were enrolled. ADC scalars were measured in 27 neonates (age range, 4-15 days) in the anterior and posterior centrum semiovale, basal ganglia, thalamus, posterior limb of the internal capsule, pons, and middle cerebellar peduncle on MRI obtained after completion of therapeutic hypothermia. The blood pressure range of each neonate with the most robust autoregulation was identified by using a near-infrared spectroscopy index. Autoregulatory function was measured by blood pressure deviation below the range with optimal autoregulation. RESULTS In neonates who had MRI on day of life ≥10, lower ADC scalars in the posterior centrum semiovale (r = -0.87, P = .003, n = 9) and the posterior limb of the internal capsule (r = -0.68, P = .04, n = 9) correlated with blood pressure deviation below the range with optimal autoregulation during hypothermia. Lower ADC scalars in the basal ganglia correlated with worse autoregulation during rewarming (r = -0.71, P = .05, n = 8). CONCLUSIONS Blood pressure deviation from the optimal autoregulatory range may be an early biomarker of injury in the posterior centrum semiovale, posterior limb of the internal capsule, and basal ganglia. Optimizing blood pressure to support autoregulation may decrease the risk of brain injury in cooled neonates with hypoxic-ischemic injury.","Tekes, A; Poretti, A; Scheurkogel, M M; Huisman, T A G M; Howlett, J A; Alqahtani, E; Lee, J-H; Parkinson, C; Shapiro, K; Chung, S-E; Jennings, J M; Gilmore, M M; Hogue, C W; Martin, L J; Koehler, R C; Northington, F J; Lee, J K",AJNR.

Investigators compared the Numbee with a traditional inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) during a restorative procedure on mandibular teeth. A randomized, split-mouth design was conducted with 15 adult subjects receiving an IANB on one side and a Numbee injection on the same tooth type on the contralateral side. Subjects recorded injection pain using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and their preferred injection technique. Anesthesia was considered profound with 2 consecutive electric pulp tester readings of 80. If subjects became symptomatic during the restorative procedure, rescue anesthesia was administered. The difference in VAS scores for injection pain between the Numbee and the IANB was not significant (p = .078). For the IANB, the incidence of profound anesthesia was 46%, and required rescue anesthesia was 20%. For the Numbee, the incidence of profound anesthesia was 0%, and required rescue anesthesia was 60%. Subject preference was evenly split (50/50%) between the 2 techniques. The IANB outperformed the Numbee device for achieving profound anesthesia and requiring less rescue anesthesia.","Christensen, Coleman; Arnason, Stephen C; Oates, Ross; Crabtree, Michael; Kersey, John W; Vandewalle, Kraig S",Anesthesia progress,https://doi.org/10.2344/anpr-67-02-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33393602/,69

The occurrence of adverse outcomes is known to depend on both the mechanical properties and flow reduction effects of the flow diverter stent. OBJECTIVE To clarify the possibility of designing a flow diverter stent considering both hemodynamic performance and mechanical properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted based on an ideal aneurysm model with flow diverters. Structural analyses of two flow diverter models exhibiting similar flow reduction effects were performed, and the radial stiffness and longitudinal flexibility were compared. RESULTS In CFD simulations, two stents-Pore2-d35 (26.77° weave angle when fully expanded, 35 μm wire thickness) and Pore3-d50 (36.65°, 50 μm respectively)-demonstrated similar flow reduction rates (68.5% spatial-averaged velocity reduction rate, 85.0% area-averaged wall shear stress reduction rate for Pore2-d35, and 68.6%, 85.4%, respectively, for Pore3-d50). However, Pore3-d50 exhibited greater radial stiffness than Pore2-d35 (40.0 vs 21.0 mN/m at a 3.5 mm outer diameter) and less longitudinal flexibility (0.903 vs 0.104 N·mm bending moments at 90°). These measurements indicate that changing the wire thickness and weave angle allows adjustment of the mechanical properties while maintaining the same degree of flow reduction effects. CONCLUSIONS The combination of CFD and structural analysis can provide promising solutions for an optimized stent. Stents exhibiting different mechanical properties but the same flow reduction effects could be designed by varying both the weave angle and wire thickness.","Suzuki, Takashi; Takao, Hiroyuki; Fujimura, Soichiro; Dahmani, Chihebeddine; Ishibashi, Toshihiro; Mamori, Hiroya; Fukushima, Naoya; Yamamoto, Makoto; Murayama, Yuichi",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2016-012561; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27646987/,69

Recent evidence demonstrates that cancer neoantigens represent important targets of cancer immunotherapy. The goal of cancer neoantigen vaccines is to induce neoantigen-specific immune responses and antitumor immunity, while minimizing the potential for autoimmune toxicity. Advances in sequencing technologies, neoantigen prediction algorithms and other technologies have dramatically improved the ability to identify and prioritize cancer neoantigens. These advances have generated considerable enthusiasm for development of neoantigen vaccines. Several neoantigen vaccine platforms are currently being evaluated in early phase clinical trials including the synthetic long peptide (SLP), RNA, dendritic cell (DC), and DNA vaccine platforms. AREAS COVERED In this review, we describe, evaluate the mechanism(s) of action, compare the advantages and disadvantages, and summarize early clinical experience with each vaccine platform. We provide perspectives on the future directions of the neoantigen vaccine field. All data are derived from Pubmed and ClinicalTrials search updated in October 2020. EXPERT OPINION Although the initial clinical experience is promising, significant challenges to the success of neoantigen vaccines include limitations in neoantigen identification and the need to successfully target the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.","Supabphol, Suangson; Li, Lijin; Goedegebuure, S Peter; Gillanders, William E",Expert opinion on investigational drugs,https://doi.org/10.1080/13543784.2021.1896702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33641576/,69

PATIENTS AND METHODS CircRNA expression profiles were obtained by circRNA microarray of four matched pairs of pericystic tissues affected by CE and adjacent normal liver tissues. qRT-PCR was used to validate the differential expression of some circRNAs identified by the microarray analysis. The potential functions of the differentially expressed circRNAs in the CE pericystic tissues were predicted by bioinformatic analysis. RESULTS Compared with the adjacent normal liver tissues, 177 circRNAs were upregulated and 166 circRNAs were downregulated in CE pericystic tissues based on a ≥2.0-fold change. The top 10 upregulated circRNAs were hsa_circRNA_001654,hsa_circRNA_103361,hsa_circRNA_001490,hsa_circRNA_104310,hsa_circRNA_100395,hsa_circRNA_102485,hsa_circRNA_001459,hsa_circRNA_104193,hsa_circRNA_400043, and hsa_circRNA_006773; The top 10 downregulated circRNAs were hsa_circRNA_400633,hsa_circRNA_404974,hsa_circRNA_068482 ,hsa_circRNA_100974,hsa_circRNA_049637,hsa_circRNA_404798,hsa_circRNA_400064,hsa_circRNA_004045,hsa_circRNA_101379, and hsa_circRNA_016771;The circRNA-seq results for 15 selected differentially expressed circRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that hsa_circRNA_006773, hsa_circRNA_049637, hsa_circRNA_104349, and hsa_circRNA_406281 were differentially expressed in CE pericystic tissues when compared with their expression in the adjacent normal liver tissues. Interestingly, 319 miRNAs and 52 mRNAs were predicted to be adsorbed by these four differentially expressed circRNAs. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that these circRNAs may be involved in the response to organic cyclic compounds and endogenous stimuli and in cellular organismal processes. CONCLUSION Differential expression of circRNAs may be associated with the development and progression of CE, and these circRNAs might be useful as biomarkers for prognosis prediction and as treatment targets.","Kalifu, Baheti; Maitiseyiti, Abulaihaiti; Ge, Xiaohu; Chen, Xiong; Meng, Yuan",Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23687; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411343/,69

131626,Allying Public Health and Abolition: Lessons From the Campaign Against Jail Construction in Los Angeles.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND E-science technologies have significantly increased the availability of data. Research grant providers such as the European Union increasingly require open access publishing of research results and data. However, despite its significance to research, the adoption rate of open data technology remains low across all disciplines, especially in Europe where research has primarily focused on technical solutions (such as Zenodo or the Open Science Framework) or considered only parts of the issue. METHODS AND FINDINGS In this study, we emphasized the non-technical factors perceived value and uncertainty factors in the context of academia, which impact researchers' acceptance of open data-the idea that researchers should not only publish their findings in the form of articles or reports, but also share the corresponding raw data sets. We present the results of a broad quantitative analysis including N = 995 researchers from 13 large to medium-sized universities in Germany. In order to test 11 hypotheses regarding researchers' intentions to share their data, as well as detect any hierarchical or disciplinary differences, we employed a structured equation model (SEM) following the partial least squares (PLS) modeling approach. CONCLUSIONS Grounded in the value-based theory, this article proclaims that most individuals in academia embrace open data when the perceived advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Furthermore, uncertainty factors impact the perceived value (consisting of the perceived advantages and disadvantages) of sharing research data. We found that researchers' assumptions about effort required during the data preparation process were diminished by awareness of e-science technologies (such as Zenodo or the Open Science Framework), which also increased their tendency to perceive personal benefits via data exchange. Uncertainty factors seem to influence the intention to share data. Effects differ between disciplines and hierarchical levels.","Stieglitz, Stefan; Wilms, Konstantin; Mirbabaie, Milad; Hofeditz, Lennart; Brenger, Bela; López, Ania; Rehwald, Stephanie",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609767/,69

135862,A Look at When Dying Really Counts: An AJPH Supplement on Mortality Data in Public Health Surveillance.,2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND Since proof emerged that IA treatment (IAT) is beneficial for patients with acute ischemic stroke, it has become the standard method of care. Despite these positive results, recovery to functional independence is established in only about one-third of treated patients. The effect of IAT is commonly assessed by functional outcome, whereas its effect on brain tissue salvage is considered a secondary outcome measure (at most). Because patient and treatment selection needs to be improved, understanding the treatment effect on brain tissue salvage is of utmost importance. OBJECTIVE To introduce infarct probability maps to estimate the location and extent of tissue damage based on patient baseline characteristics and treatment type. METHODS Cerebral infarct probability maps were created by combining automatically segmented infarct distributions using follow-up CT images of 281 patients from the MR CLEAN trial. Comparison of infarct probability maps allows visualization and quantification of probable treatment effects. Treatment impact was calculated for 10 Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) and 27 anatomical regions. RESULTS The insular cortex had the highest infarct probability in both control and IAT populations (47.2% and 42.6%, respectively). Comparison showed significant lower infarct probability in 4 ASPECTS and 17 anatomical regions in favor of IAT. Most salvaged tissue was found within the ASPECTS M2 region, which was 8.5% less likely to infarct. CONCLUSIONS Probability maps intuitively visualize the topographic distribution of infarct probability due to treatment, which makes it a promising tool for estimating the effect of treatment.","Boers, A M M; Berkhemer, O A; Slump, C H; van Zwam, W H; Roos, Y B W E M; van der Lugt, A; van Oostenbrugge, R J; Yoo, A J; Dippel, D W J; Marquering, H A; Majoie, C B L M",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2016-012387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27112775/,69

The purpose of this article is to describe the clinical and angiographic results with an emphasis on visual outcomes following the endovascular treatment of ophthalmic segment ICA aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS The records of 1254 patients who presented for endovascular treatment of a cerebral aneurysm were retrospectively reviewed to identify 65 consecutive patients who underwent coil embolization of an ophthalmic segment ICA aneurysm. The clinical records, treatment reports, and imaging were reviewed with a focus on visual outcomes. RESULTS Twenty-two of the 65 patients (34%) who presented for treatment of an ophthalmic aneurysm reported a visual disturbance at presentation. Fifteen of the 22 patients (68%) experienced an improvement in their symptoms after treatment. Overall, patients with visual symptoms were significantly more likely to benefit from treatment than to have a decline in vision (P = .03). The overall morbidity was 4%, and mortality was 0%. The retreatment rate was high at 30%, though this was disproportionately weighted by an 86% retreatment rate in patients with ruptured aneurysms. CONCLUSIONS Patients with visual symptoms attributable to ophthalmic segment ICA aneurysms undergoing endovascular coil embolization were statistically more likely to experience an improvement in their vision than to have worsening or unchanged vision.

Decades of studies have led to the discovery of a broad set of carbohydrate and protein receptors for many animal and human coronaviruses. As the main determinant of coronavirus entry, the spike protein binds to these receptors and mediates membrane fusion. Prone to mutations and recombination, spike evolution has been studied extensively. The interactions between spike proteins and their receptors are often complex and despite many advances in the field, there remains many unresolved questions concerning coronavirus tropism modification and cross-species transmission, potentially leading to delays in outbreak responses.

This interview illustrated that grounded small businesses, while implored with challenges from natural disasters, also have the resiliency to overcome such challenges when the agency has the ability to provide “turn-key” services for their clients thereby providing clients a sense of agency and value-laden experiences via personalization of services.","Bledsoe-Gardner, Anita",Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes,https://doi.org/10.1108/whatt-01-2021-0021,69
185955,Climate change and animal diseases in South America.,2008,"Since the outbreak of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, much has been discussed about the effectiveness of treatments based on hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin or another macrolide. However, few articles have dealt with the possibility of using macrolides alone in treating the disease. In the present article, the authors' hypothesis centers on the possibility that macrolides are effective against SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting the virus protease. In support of this hypothesis, significant results are collected by following an in silico strategy based on a combination of molecular topology and docking. The results are in accordance with recent clinical data generated during the pandemic which indicate that macrolides are capable of significantly reducing the viral load, reinforcing the necessity of further clinical trials. Among the most effective macrolides identified by molecular topology are azithromycin, clarithromycin, lexithromycin, flurithromycin and neutramycin.","Zanni, R.; Galvez-Llompart, M.; Galvez, J.",New Journal of Chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0nj05983h,69

The structures of the reduced oligosaccharides were determined by successive exoglycosidase digestions and by methylation analyses involving combined capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and mass fragmentography after chemical ionization with ammonia. Oligosaccharide A (Neu5Ac alpha 2----3 Gal beta 1----3 GalNAc) comprised 35% of the total carbohydrate side chains, while the remaining 65% of the oligosaccharides of E1 had the branched structure B: Neu5Ac alpha 2----3 Gal beta 1----3 (Neu5Ac alpha 2----6) GalNAc. Both oligosaccharides were linked to the E1 polypeptide via N-acetylgalactosamine, and 20% of the sialic acids present in E1 glycopeptides were found to consist of N-acetyl-9-mono-O-acetylneuraminic acid. The reported structures of the O-linked glycans are discussed in the context of the amino acid sequence of E1, which exhibits a cluster of four hydroxyamino acids (Ser-Ser-Thr-Thr) as potential O-glycosylation sites at the amino terminus.

In this report we studied the role of the cell surface glycoaminoglycans (GAGs), chondroitin sulfates A, B, and C (CS-A, -B, and -C), and heparan sulfate (HS) in the initial binding of CSFV strain Brescia to cells. Removal of HS from the surface of swine kidney cells (SK6) by heparinase I treatment almost completely abolished infection of these cells with virus that was extensively passaged in swine kidney cells before it was cloned (clone C1.1.1). Infection with C1.1.1 was inhibited completely by heparin (a GAG chemically related to HS but sulfated to a higher extent) and by dextran sulfate (an artificial highly sulfated polysaccharide), whereas HS and CS-A, -B, and -C were unable to inhibit infection. Bound C1.1.1 virus particles were released from the cell surface by treatment with heparin. Furthermore, C1.1.1 virus particles and CSFV E(rns) purified from insect cells bound to immobilized heparin, whereas purified CSFV E2 did not. These results indicate that initial binding of this virus clone is accomplished by the interaction of E(rns) with cell surface HS. In contrast, infection of SK6 cells with virus clones isolated from the blood of an infected pig and minimally passaged in SK6 cells was not affected by heparinase I treatment of cells and the addition of heparin to the medium. However, after one additional round of amplification in SK6 cells, infection with these virus clones was affected by heparinase I treatment and heparin. Sequence analysis of the E(rns) genes of these virus clones before and after amplification in SK6 cells showed that passage in SK6 cells resulted in a change of an Ser residue to an Arg residue in the C terminus of E(rns) (amino acid 476 in the polyprotein of CSFV). Replacement of the E(rns) gene of an infectious DNA copy of C1.1.1 with the E(rns) genes of these virus variants proved that acquisition of this Arg was sufficient to alter an HS-independent virus to a virus that uses HS as an E(rns) receptor.","Hulst, M M; van Gennip, H G; Moormann, R J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11000226/,69

They directly affect mobility, gait stability, quality of life, and independence. OBJECTIVES To assess the nature of joint problems encountered in a geriatric inpatient population and evaluate the contribution of a rheumatologist. METHODS We reviewed the rheumatology consultation records that were conducted in a geriatric medical center over a 10 year period. RESULTS A total of 474 consultations were held; most of these patients (86%) were hospitalized in the acute geriatric departments, 10% in the rehabilitation ward and 4% in the long-term care wards. Some patients were seen more than once. A rheumatologic joint problem was the main reason for hospitalization in 53% of these patients. Monoarthritis was the most frequent complaint (50%), followed by pauciarticular arthritis (two to five joints) in 30% of patients. Arthrocentesis, diagnostic and therapeutic, was performed in 225 patients, most of them in knee joints (81%). The most frequent diagnosis was osteoarthritis with acute exacerbation (28%), followed by gout (18%), pseudo-gout (9%) and rheumatoid arthritis (9%). In 86 cases (18%) the diagnosis was a non-specific rheumatologic problem: arthralgia, nonspecific generalized pain, or fibromyalgia. CONCLUSIONS Prompt and appropriate evaluation, as well as arthrocentesis and treatment initiation, including local injections, were made possible by the presence of an in-house rheumatologist.","Lubart, Emily; Leibovitz, Arthur; Shapir, Vadim; Segal, Refael",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24575502/,69
189338,Public health monitoring tools for multiple data streams.,2005,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW We have examined studies published since the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak that elucidate the mode of transmission of respiratory pathogens and the optimal means of interrupting their transmission, focusing on transmission in the intensive care unit. RECENT FINDINGS The severe acute respiratory syndrome may be transmitted by the droplet, contact and occasionally the airborne route. Transmission occurred most frequently when healthcare workers failed to use standard precautions such as hand washing or personal protective equipment designed to limit droplet and contact transmission. Aerosol-generating procedures increased transmission, but incomplete use of personal protective equipment during procedures was common. Recent publications have stressed the benefits of appropriate staffing levels, the use of single occupancy rooms, the immunization of healthcare workers against influenza, and the importance of healthcare workers remaining home when ill in reducing the morbidity and mortality of respiratory infection within the intensive care unit. SUMMARY Most respiratory pathogens can be transmitted by more than one route. Despite this, healthcare worker awareness of clinical syndromes associated with respiratory pathogens that require airborne precautions, combined with the use of standard precautions for all patients, and contact/droplet precautions for patients with undifferentiated febrile respiratory illness should be effective in interrupting the transmission of respiratory pathogens within the intensive care unit.","Muller, Matthew P; McGeer, Allison",Current opinion in critical care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16394782/,69

We describe here the screening of Chinese herbal medicine-based, novel small molecules that bind avidly with the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV and thus can interfere with the entry of the virus to its host cells. We achieved this by using a two-step screening method consisting of frontal affinity chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with a viral infection assay based on a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-luc/SARS pseudotyped virus. Two small molecules, tetra-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose (TGG) and luteolin, were identified, whose anti-SARS-CoV activities were confirmed by using a wild-type SARS-CoV infection system. TGG exhibits prominent anti-SARS-CoV activity with a 50% effective concentration of 4.5 microM and a selective index of 240.0. The two-step screening method described here yielded several small molecules that can be used for developing new classes of anti-SARS-CoV drugs and is potentially useful for the high-throughput screening of drugs inhibiting the entry of HIV, hepatitis C virus, and other insidious viruses into their host cells.","Yi, Ling; Li, Zhengquan; Yuan, Kehu; Qu, Xiuxia; Chen, Jian; Wang, Guangwen; Zhang, Hong; Luo, Hongpeng; Zhu, Lili; Jiang, Pengfei; Chen, Lirong; Shen, Yan; Luo, Min; Zuo, Guoying; Hu, Jianhe; Duan, Deliang; Nie, Yuchun; Shi, Xuanling; Wang, Wei; Han, Yang; Li, Taisheng; Liu, Yuqing; Ding, Mingxiao; Deng, Hongkui; Xu, Xiaojie",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15452254/,69

194962,"Viral, parasitic and prion diseases of farmed deer and bison.",2002,"Individual responses to transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are varied and therefore potentially limit its application. There is evidence that this variability is related to the contributions of Indirect waves (I-waves) recruited in the cortex. The latency of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) can be measured through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), allowing an individual's responsiveness to tDCS to be determined. However, this single-pulse method requires several different orientations of the TMS coil, potentially affecting its reliability. Instead, we propose a paired-pulse TMS paradigm targeting I-waves as an alternative method. This method uses one orientation that reduces inter- and intra-trial variability. It was hypothesized that the paired-pulse method would correlate more highly to tDCS responses than the single-pulse method. In a randomized, double blinded, cross-over design, 30 healthy participants completed two sessions, receiving 20 min of either anodal (2 mA) or sham tDCS. TMS was used to quantify Short interval intracortical facilitation (SICF) at Inter stimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1.5, 3.5 and 4.5 ms. Latency was determined in the posterior-anterior (PA), anterior-posterior (AP) and latero-medial (LM) coil orientations. The relationship between latency, SICF measures and the change in suprathreshold MEP amplitude size following tDCS were determined with Pearson's correlations. TMS measures, SICI and SICF were also used to determine responses to Anodal-tDCS (a-tDCS). Neither of the latency differences nor the SICF measures correlated to the change in MEP amplitude from pre-post tDCS (all P > 0.05). Overall, there was no significant response to tDCS in this cohort. This study highlights the need for testing the effects of various tDCS protocols on the different I-waves. Further research into SICF and whether it is a viable measure of I-wave facilitation is warranted.","Nuzum, Nathan D; Hendy, Ashlee M; Russell, Aaron P; Teo, Wei-Peng",Frontiers in human neuroscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27766075/,69

It will also discuss innate and adaptive immune responses, by exploring the possible modulation/regulation of innate and adaptive immunity by Toll-like receptors, in view of recent findings observed in the ocular surface. RECENT FINDINGS Current knowledge indicates that Toll-like receptors represent essential elements in host defence against pathogens, a prerequisite to the induction of adaptive immune responses. The expression/distribution of Toll-like receptors in the healthy eye highlights the possible function of Toll-like receptors in both innate and adaptive responses during pathological conditions of the ocular surface. SUMMARY Recent findings have greatly increased the knowledge of the possible role of Toll-like receptors in innate and adaptive immune responses. Toll-like receptors seem to play different roles in a wide range of activities of the immune system, and might represent an exclusive link between innate and adaptive responses under pathological conditions. Recent studies in ophthalmology have highlighted the role of Toll-like receptors in infections (keratitis) as well as in allergic states of the ocular surface. This review thus describes the relationship between Toll-like receptors and the main immune/structural cells taking part in inflammatory disorders. Understanding the complex mechanisms underlying Toll-like receptor localization and function will provide additional data that might help devise novel therapeutic approaches involving Toll-like receptors and their agonists, in an attempt to modulate the biased immune system.","Micera, Alessandra; Stampachiacchiere, Barbara; Aronni, Silvia; dos Santos, Myrna Serapiao; Lambiase, Alessandro",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16131923/,69

The circumstance demanded online classes as the alternative strategy for continuation of education. Objective To assess current practice and perception about online education among faculties of dental colleges in Nepal. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted among 208 faculties of all dental colleges in Nepal. Data collection was done through structured online questionnaire comprising demographic information, practice and perception of the respondents towards online education. Descriptive statistics surveyed the frequency distribution and Chisquare test assessed the difference in perception among the faculties of different universities. Result The response rate was 74.3%. Faculties commonly used PowerPoint presentation (96.6%) on Zoom platform (83.3%) using laptop (94.7%) with Wi-Fi connection (91.8%). Majority of faculties had good or satisfactory access to internet (94.8%). The faculties believed that the online class environment was interactive (95.2%); but it was not effective (86.5%) as live classroom. Majority of the faculties (79.4%) felt tracking of students' presence was difficult. There was no significant difference on perception towards online class among the faculties of Kathmandu University, Tribhuvan University and BP Koirala Institute Health Sciences at p < 0.05. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has paved the way for e-learning in dental education in Nepal. Faculties agree to complete the theory syllabus and conduct sessional exams as an alternative during the lockdown period. However, they show strong reservations in carrying out practical/clinical simulations and university exams online.

196759,Transgenic farm animals: present and future.,2005,"Ribosomes can be programmed to shift from one reading frame to another during translation. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) uses such a mechanism to produce F protein from the -2/+1 reading frame. We now report that the HCV frameshift signal can mediate the synthesis of the core protein of the zero frame, the F protein of the -2/+1 frame, and a 1.5-kDa protein of the -1/+2 frame. This triple decoding function does not require sequences flanking the frameshift signal and is apparently independent of membranes and the synthesis of the HCV polyprotein. Two consensus -1 frameshift sequences in the HCV type 1 frameshift signal facilitate ribosomal frameshifts into both overlapping reading frames. A sequence which is located immediately downstream of the frameshift signal and has the potential to form a double stem-loop structure can significantly enhance translational frameshifting in the presence of the peptidyl-transferase inhibitor puromycin. Based on these results, a model is proposed to explain the triple decoding activities of the HCV ribosomal frameshift signal.","Choi, Jinah; Xu, Zhenming; Ou, Jing-hsiung",Molecular and cellular biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12588970/,69

Airborne infectious, allergic and pollution agents are among the most common inflammatory factors which may affect brain function via the brain-nose interface. The inflammatory processes triggered in the upper respiratory tract by these agents are positioned to influence the immune response of the brain and therefore, influence its function and alter behavior. Several clinical and epidemiological studies find an association between inflammatory factors affecting the intranasal pathway and neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases as well as mental disorders including anxiety and mood disorders. However the mechanisms of interaction between the immune response in the nasal epithelium and the brain are poorly understood.

197827,Ecological sources of zoonotic diseases.,2004,"Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in normal neural cell function. Dysregulated or overexpression of NO contributes to neurologic damage associated with various pathologies, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurological disease. Previous studies suggest that HIV-infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) produce low levels of NO in vitro and that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is expressed in the brain of patients with neurologic disease. However, the levels of NO could not account for the degree of neural toxicity observed. In this study, we found that induction of iNOS with concomitant production of NO occurred in primary human astrocytes, but not in MDM, when astrocytes were cocultured with HIV-1-infected MDM. This coincided with decreased HIV replication in infected MDM. Supernatants from cocultures of infected MDM and astrocytes also stimulated iNOS/NO expression in astrocytes, but cytokines known to induce iNOS expression (interferon-gamma, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) were not detected. In addition, the recombinant HIV-1 envelope protein gp41, but not rgp120, induced iNOS in cocultures of uninfected MDM and astrocytes. This suggests that astrocytes may be an important source of NO production due to dysregulated iNOS expression and may constitute one arm of the host response resulting in suppression of HIV-1 replication in the brain. It also leads us to speculate that neurologic damage observed in HIV disease may ensue from prolonged, high level production of NO.","Hori, K; Burd, P R; Furuke, K; Kutza, J; Weih, K A; Clouse, K A",Blood,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10068656/,69
198392,Vaccination in conservation medicine.,2007,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus papain-like protease (SARS-CoV PLpro) is involved in the processing of the viral polyprotein and, thereby, contributes to the biogenesis of the virus replication complex. Structural bioinformatics has revealed a relationship for the SARS-CoV PLpro to herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP), a ubiquitin-specific protease, indicating potential deubiquitinating activity in addition to its function in polyprotein processing (T. Sulea, H. A. Lindner, E. O. Purisima, and R. Menard, J. Virol. 79:4550-4551, 2005). In order to confirm this prediction, we overexpressed and purified SARS-CoV PLpro (amino acids [aa]1507 to 1858) from Escherichia coli. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed ubiquitin-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ub-AMC), a general deubiquitinating enzyme substrate, with a catalytic efficiency of 13,100 M(-1)s(-1), 220-fold more efficiently than the small synthetic peptide substrate Z-LRGG-AMC, which incorporates the C-terminal four residues of ubiquitin. In addition, SARS-CoV PLpro was inhibited by the specific deubiquitinating enzyme inhibitor ubiquitin aldehyde, with an inhibition constant of 210 nM. The purified SARS-CoV PLpro disassembles branched polyubiquitin chains with lengths of two to seven (Ub2-7) or four (Ub4) units, which involves isopeptide bond cleavage. SARS-CoV PLpro processing activity was also detected against a protein fused to the C terminus of the ubiquitin-like modifier ISG15, both in vitro using the purified enzyme and in HeLa cells by coexpression with SARS-CoV PLpro (aa 1198 to 2009). These results clearly establish that SARS-CoV PLpro is a deubiquitinating enzyme, thereby confirming our earlier prediction. This unexpected activity for a coronavirus papain-like protease suggests a novel viral strategy to modulate the host cell ubiquitination machinery to its advantage.","Lindner, Holger A; Fotouhi-Ardakani, Nasser; Lytvyn, Viktoria; Lachance, Paule; Sulea, Traian; Ménard, Robert",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16306591/,69

Infection control precautions for hospital visitors are needed to avoid cluster outbreaks, so this study investigated the visiting policies of all the hospitals in Taiwan in the time of COVID-19. METHODS: From March 15, 2020, through March 18, 2020, we searched the official websites of all 472 National Health Insurance contracted hospitals to determine their visiting policies. For those hospitals that had posted new visiting policies and still allowed visits to ordinary wards, we recorded the relevant details shown on their websites, including the number of visitors allowed at one time, the number of visiting slots per day, the total visiting hours per day, and the rules provided to visitors before visiting. RESULTS: During the study period, 276 (58.5%) hospitals had posted new visiting policies on their websites, with higher proportions of academic medical centers (92.0%, 23/25) and metropolitan hospitals (91.5%, 75/82) than local community hospitals (48.8%, 178/365) doing so. Visits to ordinary wards were forbidden in 83 hospitals of those hospitals. Among the 193 hospitals that had new visiting policies and still allowed visits to ordinary wards, 73.1% (n = 141) restricted visitors to two at a time and 54.9% (n = 106) restricted visits to two visiting slots per day. Furthermore, history taking regarding travel, occupation, contacts, and cluster information was mentioned by 82.4% (n = 159) of these 193 hospitals, body temperature monitoring by 78.2% (n = 151), hand hygiene by 63.2% (n = 122), and identity checks by 51.8% (n = 100). CONCLUSION: In the time of COVID-19 covered by this study, about three-fifths of the hospitals in Taiwan had posted their visiting policies for ordinary wards on their websites. Furthermore, the thoroughness with which such visiting policies have been enforced also requires investigation.","Liu, Ya-An; Hsu, Ya-Chuan; Lin, Ming-Hwai; Chang, Hsiao-Ting; Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Chou, Li-Fang; Hwang, Shinn-Jang",J Chin Med Assoc,,69

Thematic analysis of the data showed two sets of issues that the caregivers of persons with dementia faced in their experiences during the pandemic. The first set was unique to the caregivers that directly related to their caregiving role, while the second set did not relate directly to their caregiving role. These two sets also appeared to have a two-way interaction influencing each other. These issues generated needs, some of which required immediate support while others required longer-term support. The caregivers suggested several methods, such as use of video-consultations, telephone-based support and clinic-based in-person visits to meet their needs. They also wanted more services postpandemic. CONCLUSION: Caregivers of persons with dementia had multiple needs during the pandemic. Supporting them during these times require a pragmatic multilayered approach. Systemic changes, policies and frameworks, increased awareness, use of technology, and better access to health are necessary.","Vaitheswaran, Sridhar; Lakshminarayanan, Monisha; Ramanujam, Vaishnavi; Sargunan, Subashini; Venkatesan, Shreenila",Am. j. geriatr. psychiatry,,69

Since these are the main entrainment factors for biological rhythms [2], we hypothesized that the lockdown may have affected sleep and circadian rhythms. We indeed show that participants slept longer and later during lockdown weekdays, and exhibited lower levels of social jetlag. While this may seem to be an overall improvement of sleep conditions, chronotype was also delayed under the lockdown. This signature of a weaker light-dark cycle should be monitored attentively since it may progressively cause disruptive effects on sleep and circadian rhythms, affecting human performance and health [3].","Leone, María Juliana; Sigman, Mariano; Golombek, Diego Andrés",Curr Biol,,69

472395,Raising ethnicity recording in NHS Lothian from 3% to 90% in 3 years: processes and analysis of data from Accidents and Emergencies,2020,"Dwell time has been widely used in various fields to evaluate content quality and user engagement. Although many studies shown that content with long dwell time is good quality, contents with short dwell time have not been discussed in detail. We hypothesize that content with short dwell time is not always low quality and does not always have low user engagement, but is instead related to user interest. The purpose of this study is to clarify the meanings of short dwell time browsing in mobile news application. First, we analyze the relation of short dwell time to user interest using large scale user behavior logs from a mobile news application. This analysis was conducted on a vector space based on users click histories and then users and articles were mapped in the same space. The users with short dwell time are concentrated on a specific position in this space; thus, the length of dwell time is related to their interest. Moreover, we also analyze the characteristics of short dwell time browsing by excluding these browses from their click histories. Surprisingly, excluding short dwell time click history, it was found that short dwell time click history included some aspect of user interest in 30.87% of instances where the cluster of users changed. These findings demonstrate that short dwell time does not always indicate a low level of user engagement, but also level of user interest.","Homma, Ryosuke; Seki, Yoshifumi; Yoshida, Mitsuo; Umemura, Kyoji",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13992v1.pdf,69
486130,The COSMO-Spain Survey: Three First Rounds of the WHO Behavioral Insights Tool,2021,"The influence of introducing acrylic acid (AA) into the reaction mixture with acrylonitrile at the synthesis of copolymers by free-radical polymerization (FRP) and radical polymerization with reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) on the rheological properties of their solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide, as well as on the capability to spin fibers by the mechanotropic method, is analyzed. The influence of AA dosing conditions on the rheological properties of the solutions in the concentration range above the crossover point was not revealed. In the case of RAFT synthesis, the rheological properties differ distinctively in the high concentration region that is expressed by unusual viscoelastic characteristics. Dilute solution viscometry revealed the influence of the comonomer loading order on the interaction intensity of the copolymer macromolecules with a solvent, which is more pronounced for samples synthesized by FRP and can be associated with the copolymers' molecular structure. Fiber spinning from solutions of polyacrylonitrile and its copolymers (PAN) synthesized by the RAFT method was not able to achieve a high degree of orientation drawing, while for polymers with a wider molecular weight distribution synthesized by FRP, it was possible to realize large stretches, which led to high-quality fibers with strength values up to 640 MPa and elongation at a break of 20%.","Skvortsov, Ivan Y; Chernikova, Elena V; Kulichikhin, Valery G; Varfolomeeva, Lydia A; Kuzin, Mikhail S; Toms, Roman V; Prokopov, Nikolay I",,,69
513277,The Community Eligibility Provision: Continuing the Century-Long Debate Over Universal Free School Meals,2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the last few months has disrupted the healthcare system globally. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological and emotional well-being of healthcare workers (HCWs). Materials and methods: We conducted an online, cross-sectional, multinational survey, assessing the anxiety (using Generalized Anxiety Disorder [GAD-2] and GAD-7), depression (using Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression), and insomnia (using Insomnia Severity Index), among HCWs across India, the Middle East, and North America. We used univariate and bivariate logistic regression to identify risk factors for psychological distress. Results: The prevalence of clinically significant anxiety, depression, and insomnia were 41.4, 48.0, and 31.3%, respectively. On bivariate logistic regression, lack of social or emotional support to HCWs was independently associated with anxiety [odds ratio (OR), 3.81 (2.84-3.90)], depression [OR, 6.29 (4.50-8.79)], and insomnia [OR, 3.79 (2.81-5.110)]. Female gender and self-COVID-19 were independent risk factors for anxiety [OR, 3.71 (1.53-9.03) and 1.71 (1.23-2.38)] and depression [OR, 1.72 (1.27-2.31) and 1.62 (1.14-2.30)], respectively. Frontliners were independently associated with insomnia [OR, 1.68 (1.23-2.29)]. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic has a high prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia among HCWs. Female gender, frontliners, self-COVID-19, and absence of social or emotional support are the independent risk factors for psychological distress.","Jagiasi, B.

We derive the basic reproduction number R0 and study the local stability of the disease-free and endemic states. Since the condition R0 < 1 for our model does not determine if the disease will die out, we consider the backward bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation to understand the dynamics of the disease at the occurrence of a second wave and the kind of treatment measures needed to curtail it. Our results show that the limited availability of medical resources favours the emergence of complex dynamics that complicates the control of the outbreak.","Oluyori, D. A.; Perez, A. G.

METHODS: Fifteen patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from four hospitals were prospectively enrolled and matched samples of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs and saliva were collected at Day 1 of admission and every other day till consequently negative for two times. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was performed to detect the envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) genes. RESULTS: The cycle threshold values of saliva were comparable to those of NP/OP swabs overall (P = 0.720, Mann–Whitney U test). However, the overall sensitivity of rRT-PCR using saliva was 64% (34/53), which is lower than the 77% (41/53) using NP/OP swabs. The sensitivity of rRT-PCR using saliva was especially lower in early stage of symptom onset (1–5 days; 8/15; 53%) and in patients who did not have sputum (12/22; 55%). CONCLUSION: Saliva sample itself is not appropriate for initial diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to replace NP/OP swabs, especially for the person who does not produce sputum. COVID-19 cannot be excluded when the test using saliva is negative, and it is necessary to retest using NP/OP swabs.","Kim, Seong Eun; Lee, Ji Yeon; Lee, Ahrang; Kim, Soosung; Park, Kyung-Hwa; Jung, Sook-In; Kang, Seung-Ji; Oh, Tae Hoon; Kim, Uh Jin; Lee, Seung Yeob; Kee, Seung-Jung; Jang, Hee-Chang",J Korean Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32776725/,69
