131,131,131,Diagnosis and treatment of severe sepsis,18.535234,10.92242,2007-12-19,"The burden of infection in industrialized countries has prompted considerable effort to improve the outcomes of patients with sepsis. This has been formalized through the Surviving Sepsis Campaign 'bundles', derived from the recommendations of 11 professional societies, which have promoted global improvement in those practices whose primary goal it is to reduce sepsis-related death. However, difficulties remain in implementing all of the procedures recommended by the experts, despite the apparent pragmatism of those procedures. We summarize the main proposals made by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and focus on the difficulties associated with making a proper diagnosis and supplying adequate treatment promptly to septic patients.","Claessens, Yann-Erick; Dhainaut, Jean-François",Crit Care,84,12
339,339,339,Clinical review: Primary influenza viral pneumonia,18.488224,10.805009,2009-12-21,"Primary influenza pneumonia has a high mortality rate during pandemics, not only in immunocompromised individuals and patients with underlying comorbid conditions, but also in young healthy adults. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for this diagnosis in patients presenting with influenza-like symptoms that progress quickly (2 to 5 days) to respiratory distress and extensive pulmonary involvement. The sensitivity of rapid diagnostic techniques in identifying infections with the pandemic 2009 H1N1v influenza strain is currently suboptimal. The most reliable real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction molecular testing is available in limited clinical settings. Despite 6 months of pandemic circulation, most novel H1N1v pandemic strains remain susceptible to oseltamivir. Ensuring an appropriate oxygenation and ventilation strategy, as well as prompt initiation of antiviral therapy, is essential in management.","Rello, Jordi; Pop-Vicas, Aurora",Crit Care,84,12
663,663,663,Red blood cell transfusion in the critically ill patient,18.552668,10.4658985,2011-10-04,"Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is a common intervention in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Anemia is frequent in this population and is associated with poor outcomes, especially in patients with ischemic heart disease. Although blood transfusions are generally given to improve tissue oxygenation, they do not systematically increase oxygen consumption and effects on oxygen delivery are not always very impressive. Blood transfusion may be lifesaving in some circumstances, but many studies have reported increased morbidity and mortality in transfused patients. This review focuses on some important aspects of RBC transfusion in the ICU, including physiologic considerations, a brief description of serious infectious and noninfectious hazards of transfusion, and the effects of RBC storage lesions. Emphasis is placed on the importance of personalizing blood transfusion according to physiological endpoints rather than arbitrary thresholds.","Lelubre, Christophe; Vincent, Jean-Louis",Ann Intensive Care,84,12

1932,1932,1932,Severe Measles Infection: The Spectrum of Disease in 36 Critically Ill Adult Patients,18.290731,10.531645,2013-09-13,"France has recently witnessed a nationwide outbreak of measles. Data on severe forms of measles in adults are lacking. We sought to describe the epidemiologic, clinical, treatment, and prognostic aspects of the disease in adult patients who required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). We performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 36 adults admitted to a total of 64 ICUs throughout France for complications of measles from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2011. All cases of measles were confirmed by serologic testing and/or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The cohort consisted of 21 male and 15 female patients, with a median age of 29.2 years (25th–75th interquartile range [IQR], 27.2–34.2 yr) and a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) of 13 (IQR, 9–18). Among the 26 patients whose measles vaccination status was documented, none had received 2 injections. One patient had developed measles during childhood. Underlying comorbid conditions included chronic respiratory disease in 9 patients, immunosuppression in 7 patients, and obesity in 3 patients, while measles affected 5 pregnant women. Respiratory complications induced by measles infection led to ICU admission in 32 cases, and measles-related neurologic complications led to ICU admission in 2 cases. Two patients were admitted due to concurrent respiratory and neurologic complications. Bacterial superinfection of measles-related airway infection was suspected in 28 patients and was documented in 8. Four cases of community-acquired pneumonia, 6 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia, 1 case of tracheobronchitis, and 2 cases of sinusitis were microbiologically substantiated. Of 11 patients who required mechanical ventilation, 9 developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among the patients with ARDS, extraalveolar air leak complications occurred in 4 cases. Five patients died, all of whom were severely immunocompromised. On follow-up, 1 patient had severe chronic respiratory failure related to lung fibrosis, and 2 patients had mild lower limb paraparesis along with bladder dysfunction, both of which were ascribable to measles-induced encephalitis and myelitis. Among the 5 pregnant patients, the course of measles infection was uneventful, albeit 1 patient underwent emergent cesarean delivery because of fetal growth restriction. Measles is a disease with protean and potentially deceptive clinical manifestations, especially in the immunocompromised patient. Measles-associated pneumonitis and its complications, and less commonly postinfectious encephalomyelitis, are the main source of morbidity and mortality. In contrast with the usually benign course of the disease in immunocompetent patients, measles occurring in immunocompromised patients gives rise to lethal complications including ARDS, with or without bacterial superinfection. Other patients potentially at high risk for severe measles are young adults and pregnant women. Measles pneumonitis may predispose to air leak disease in patients using mechanical ventilation. To date, vaccination remains the most potent tool to control measles infection.","Rafat, Cédric; Klouche, Kada; Ricard, Jean-Damien; Messika, Jonathan; Roch, Antoine; Machado, Sonia; Sonneville, Romain; Guisset, Olivier; Pujol, Wilfried; Guérin, Claude; Teboul, Jean-Louis; Mrozek, Natacha; Darmon, Michaël; Chemouni, Frank; Schmidt, Matthieu; Mercier, Emmanuelle; Dreyfuss, Didier; Gaudry, Stéphane",Medicine (Baltimore),84,19
2417,2417,2417,New aspects in the management of pneumonia,18.52965,10.803122,2016-10-01,"Despite improvements in the management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), morbidity and mortality are still high, especially in patients with more severe disease. Early and appropriate antibiotics remain the cornerstone in the treatment of CAP. However, two aspects seem to contribute to a worse outcome: an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction and an inadequate immune response. Adjuvant treatments, such as corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulins, have been proposed to counterbalance these effects. The use of corticosteroids in patients with severe CAP and a strong inflammatory reaction can reduce the time to clinical stability, the risk of treatment failure, and the risk of progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The administration of intravenous immunoglobulins seems to reinforce the immune response to the infection in particular in patients with inadequate levels of antibodies and when an enriched IgM preparation has been used; however, more studies are needed to determinate their impact on outcome and to define the population that will receive more benefit.","Prina, Elena; Ceccato, Adrian; Torres, Antoni",Crit Care,84,12
2468,2468,2468,Septic shock with no diagnosis at 24 hours: a pragmatic multicenter prospective cohort study,18.596115,10.556348,2016-11-06,"BACKGROUND: The lack of a patent source of infection after 24 hours of management of shock considered septic is a common and disturbing scenario. We aimed to determine the prevalence and the causes of shock with no diagnosis 24 hours after its onset, and to compare the outcomes of patients with early-confirmed septic shock to those of others. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, prospective, multicenter observational cohort study in ten intensive care units (ICU) in France. We included all consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with suspected septic shock defined by clinical suspicion of infection leading to antibiotic prescription plus acute circulatory failure requiring vasopressor support. RESULTS: A total of 508 patients were admitted with suspected septic shock. Among them, 374 (74 %) had early-confirmed septic shock, while the 134 others (26 %) had no source of infection identified nor microbiological documentation retrieved 24 hours after shock onset. Among these, 37/134 (28 %) had late-confirmed septic shock diagnosed after 24 hours, 59/134 (44 %) had a condition mimicking septic (septic shock mimicker, mainly related to adverse drug reactions, acute mesenteric ischemia and malignancies) and 38/134 (28 %) had shock of unknown origin by the end of the ICU stay. There were no differences between patients with early-confirmed septic shock and the remainder in ICU mortality and the median duration of ICU stay, of tracheal intubation and of vasopressor support. The multivariable Cox model showed that the risk of day-60 mortality did not differ between patients with or without early-confirmed septic shock. A sensitivity analysis was performed in the subgroup (n = 369/508) of patients meeting the Sepsis-3 definition criteria and displayed consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of the patients admitted in the ICU with suspected septic shock had no infection identified 24 hours after its onset and almost half of them were eventually diagnosed with a septic shock mimicker. Outcome did not differ between patients with early-confirmed septic shock and other patients.

3149,3149,3149,Fungal infections in adult patients on extracorporeal life support,18.742388,10.697182,2018-04-17,"BACKGROUND: Patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are often among the most severely ill in the intensive care unit. They are often receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics; they have multiple entry points for pathogens; and their immune system is impaired by blood circuit interaction. These factors are thought to predispose them to fungal infections. We thus aimed to evaluate the prevalence, risk factors, and prognosis of fungal infections in adults on ECMO. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry, which compiles data on ECMO use from hundreds of international centers. We included all adult patients from 2006 to 2016 on any mode of ECMO with either a diagnosis of fungal infection or a positive fungal culture. RESULTS: Our study comprised 2129 adult patients (10.8%) with fungal colonization or infection. Aspergillus involvement (colonization or infection) was present in 272 patients (1.4%), of whom 35.7% survived to hospital discharge. There were 245 patients (1.2%) with Candida invasive bloodstream infection, with 35.9% survival. Risk factors for Aspergillus involvement included solid organ transplant (OR 1.83; p = 0.008), respiratory support (OR 2.75; p < 0.001), and influenza infection (OR 2.48; p < 0.001). Risk factors for candidemia included sepsis (OR 1.60; p = 0.005) and renal replacement therapy (OR 1.55; p = 0.007). In multivariable analysis, Aspergillus involvement (OR 0.40; p < 0.001) and candidemia (OR 0.47; p < 0.001) were both independently associated with decreased survival. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of Aspergillus involvement and Candida invasive bloodstream infection were not higher in patients on ECMO than what has been reported in the general intensive care population. Both were independently associated with a reduced survival. Aspergillus involvement was strongly associated with ECMO for respiratory support and influenza.

Patients/Method: In this pre-planned sub-study of the PermiT (Permissive Underfeeding vs. Target Enteral Feeding in Adult Critically Ill Patients) trial, we included critically ill patients who were expected to stay for ≥14 days in the intensive care unit. We measured FFAs level on day 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 of enrollment. Of 70 enrolled patients, 23 (32.8%) patients had high FFAs level (baseline FFAs level >0.45 mmol/L in females and >0.6 mmol/L in males). Results: Patients with high FFAs level were significantly older and more likely to be females and diabetics and they had lower ratio of partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen, higher creatinine, and higher total cholesterol levels than those with normal FFAs level. During the study period, patients with high FFAs level had higher blood glucose and required more insulin. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, the predictors of high baseline FFAs level were diabetes (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 5.36; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.56, 18.43, p = 0.008) and baseline cholesterol level (aOR, 4.29; 95% CI: 11.64, 11.19, p = 0.003). Serial levels of FFAs did not differ with time between permissive underfeeding and standard feeding groups. FFAs level was not associated with 90-day mortality (aOR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.09, 2.60, p = 0.40). Conclusion: We conclude that high FFAs level in critically ill patients is associated with features of metabolic syndrome and is not affected by short-term permissive underfeeding.","Arabi, Yaseen M.; Tamimi, Waleed; Jones, Gwynne; Jawdat, Dunia; Tamim, Hani; Al-Dorzi, Hasan M.; Sadat, Musharaf; Afesh, Lara; Sakhija, Maram; Al-Dawood, Abdulaziz",Nutrients,84,33
4407,4407,4407,Clinical and microbiological effect of pulsed xenon ultraviolet disinfection to reduce multidrug-resistant organisms in the intensive care unit in a Japanese hospital: a before-after study,18.583271,10.817854,2020-01-29,"BACKGROUND: No-touch environmental disinfection using ultraviolet devices has been highlighted in the past several years to control the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). However, its effectiveness in non-US healthcare settings is yet to be examined. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of disinfection by portable pulsed xenon ultraviolet (PX-UV) devices in controlling transmission of MDROs in a non-US healthcare setting. METHODS: All patients admitted in the intensive care unit in a 629-bed tertiary referral hospital in Japan from August 2016 to February 2019 were enrolled. During the study period, PX-UV disinfection was added to manual terminal cleaning after every patient transfer/discharge. For microbiological evaluation, surfaces were selected for sampling by contact plates before/after manual cleaning and after PX-UV. After overnight incubation, colonies on the plates were counted. RESULTS: The incidence of newly acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) declined significantly (13.8 to 9.9 per 10,000 patient days, incidence rate ratio 0.71, p = 0.002), as well as that of newly acquired drug-resistant Acinetobacter (48.5 to 18.1, 0.37, p < 0.001). The percent reduction of the microbiological burden by manual cleaning was 81%, but a further 59% reduction was achieved by PX-UV. CONCLUSIONS: PX-UV is effective in further reducing the microbial burden and controlling MDROs in a non-US healthcare setting.","Morikane, Keita; Suzuki, Shoko; Yoshioka, Jun; Yakuwa, Jun; Nakane, Masaki; Nemoto, Kenji",BMC Infect Dis,84,12
4420,4420,4420,Efficacy and safety of early prone positioning combined with HFNC or NIV in moderate to severe ARDS: a multi-center prospective cohort study,18.297024,10.568711,2020-01-30,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that prone positioning (PP) can increase PaO(2)/FiO(2) and reduce mortality in moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The aim of our study was to determine whether the early use of PP combined with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) can avoid the need for intubation in moderate to severe ARDS patients. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study was performed in two teaching hospitals. Non-intubated moderate to severe ARDS patients were included and were placed in PP with NIV or with HFNC. The efficacy in improving oxygenation with four support methods—HFNC, HFNC+PP, NIV, NIV+PP—were evaluated by blood gas analysis. The primary outcome was the rate of intubation. RESULTS: Between January 2018 and April 2019, 20 ARDS patients were enrolled. The main causes of ARDS were pneumonia due to influenza (9 cases, 45%) and other viruses (2 cases, 10%). Ten cases were moderate ARDS and 10 cases were severe. Eleven patients avoided intubation (success group), and 9 patients were intubated (failure group). All 7 patients with a PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 100 mmHg on NIV required intubation. PaO(2)/FiO(2) in HFNC+PP were significantly higher in the success group than in the failure group (125 ± 41 mmHg vs 119 ± 19 mmHg, P = 0.043). PaO(2)/FiO(2) demonstrated an upward trend in patients with all four support strategies: HFNC < HFNC+PP ≤ NIV < NIV+PP. The average duration for PP was 2 h twice daily. CONCLUSIONS: Early application of PP with HFNC, especially in patients with moderate ARDS and baseline SpO(2) > 95%, may help avoid intubation. The PP was well tolerated, and the efficacy on PaO(2)/FiO(2) of the four support strategies was HFNC < HFNC+PP ≤ NIV < NIV+PP. Severe ARDS patients were not appropriate candidates for HFNC/NIV+PP.

Unraveling the involvement of miRNA as a key cellular factor during in vitro canine parvovirus (CPV) infection may facilitate the discovery of potential intervention candidates. However, the examination of miRNA expression profiles in CPV in tissue culture systems has not been fully elucidated. METHOD: In the present study, we utilized high-throughput small RNA-seq (sRNA-seq) technology to investigate the altered miRNA profiling in miRNA libraries from uninfected (Control) and CPV-2c infected Crandell Reese Feline Kidney cells. RESULTS: We identified five of known miRNAs (miR-222-5p, miR-365-2-5p, miR-1247-3p, miR-322-5p and miR-361-3p) and three novel miRNAs (Novel 137, Novel 141 and Novel 102) by sRNA-seq with differentially expressed genes in the miRNA repertoire of CPV-infected cells over control. We further predicted the potential target genes of the aforementioned miRNAs using sequence homology algorithms. Notably, the targets of miR-1247-3p exhibited a potential function associated with cellular defense and humoral response to CPV. To extend the probing scheme for gene targets of miR-1247-3p, we explored and performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of its target genes. We discovered 229 putative targets from a total of 38 enriched GO terms. The top over-represented GO enrichment in biological process were lymphocyte activation and differentiation, marginal zone B cell differentiation, negative regulation of cytokine production, negative regulation of programed cell death, and negative regulation of signaling. We next constructed a GO biological process network composed of 28 target genes of miR-1247-3p, of which, some genes, namely BCL6, DLL1, GATA3, IL6, LEF1, LFNG and WNT1 were among the genes with obviously intersected in multiple GO terms. CONCLUSION: The miRNA-1247-3p and its cognate target genes suggested their great potential as novel therapeutic targets or diagnostic biomarkers of CPV or other related viruses.","Chuammitri, Phongsakorn; Vannamahaxay, Soulasack; Sornpet, Benjaporn; Pringproa, Kidsadagon; Patchanee, Prapas",PeerJ,84,12

As there is no previous study on antibiotic resistance in patients with clinical features of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in Sierra Leone, research is needed to inform public health policies. Our study aimed to assess antibiotic resistance rates from isolates in the urine and sputum samples of patients with clinical features of HAIs. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a cross-sectional study of adult inpatients aged ≥18 years at Connaught Hospital, an urban tertiary care hospital in Freetown between February and June 2018. RESULTS: Over the course of the study, we enrolled 164 patients. Risk factors for HAIs were previous antibiotic use (93.3%), comorbidities (58.5%) and age (≥65 years) (23.9%). Of the 164 samples, 89.6% were urine. Bacterial growth was recorded in 58.8% of cultured specimens; the type of specimen was an independent predictor of bacterial growth (p < 0.021). The most common isolates were Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae; 29.2% and 19.0% in urine samples and 18.8% and 31.3% in sputum samples, respectively. The overall resistance rates were 58% for all extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms, 13.4% for carbapenem-resistant non-lactose fermenting gram-negative bacilli, 8.7% for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) and 1.3% for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). There were no carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) isolates but all Staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a high prevalence rate of ESBL-producing organisms which are a significant burden at the main tertiary hospital in Sierra Leone.

Preventing future allergic reactions in patients who have already developed a systemic reaction is based on the correct management of the acute phase of the reaction followed by a correct diagnosis and, where indicated, prescription of adrenaline autoinjectors and VIT. A possible strategy to optimize care processes and to improve outcomes is the implementation of a Diagnostic and Therapeutic Care Pathways, also known as Integrated Care Pathways or Clinical Pathways (CPWs). The aim of the care pathway is to enhance the quality of care by improving risk‐adjusted patient outcomes, promoting patient safety, increasing patient satisfaction, and optimizing the use of resources. To our knowledge, currently in Italy as well as in Europe, there is no CPWs codified for the management of HVA patients. This paper describes the development of the clinical content of a care pathway for the management of HVA. METHODS: The methodology applied is based on the eight step method to build the clinical content of an evidence-based care pathway suggested by Lodewijckx et al. RESULTS: Three hundred and seventeen different clinical activities were extracted from the selected literature. The expert panel was involved in their evaluation, expressing a judgment of relevance through the Delphi study. As a result, 126 clinical activities were appraised to be valid and feasible. The final recommendations (126) were translated into 123 key interventions. Six indicators were produced by the clinical activities.

Our aim was to investigate the effects of thoracic trauma on the in-hospital course and outcome of patients with TBI. METHODS: We performed a matched pair analysis of the multicenter trauma database TraumaRegisterDGU® (TR-DGU) in the 5-year period from 2012 to 2016. We included adult patients (≥18 years of age) with moderate to severe TBI (abbreviated injury scale (AIS)= 3–5). Patients with isolated TBI (group 1) were compared to patients with TBI and varying degrees of additional blunt thoracic trauma (AIS(Thorax)= 2–5) (group 2). Matching criteria were gender, age, severity of TBI, initial GCS and presence/absence of shock. The χ(2)-test was used for comparing categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney-U-test was chosen for continuous parameters. Statistical significance was defined by a p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 5414 matched pairs (10,828 patients) were included. The presence of additional thoracic injuries in patients with TBI was associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation and a prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay. Additional thoracic trauma was also associated with higher mortality rates. These effects were most pronounced in thoracic AIS subgroups 4 and 5. Additional thoracic trauma, regardless of its severity (AIS(Thorax) ≥2) was associated with significantly decreased rates of good neurologic recovery (GOS = 5) after TBI. CONCLUSIONS: Chest trauma in general, regardless of its initial severity (AIS(Thorax)= 2–5), is associated with decreased chance of good neurologic recovery after TBI. Affected patients should be considered “at risk” and vigilance for the maintenance of optimal neuro-protective measures should be high.","Schieren, Mark; Wappler, Frank; Wafaisade, Arasch; Lefering, Rolf; Sakka, Samir G.; Kaufmann, Jost; Heiroth, Hi-Jae; Defosse, Jerome; Böhmer, Andreas B.",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,84,12

For safety reasons, modern vaccinology tends toward the usage of inactivated or attenuated microorganisms and uses predominantly subunit vaccines. The antigens need to be clearly defined, pure, stable, appropriately composed, and properly presented to the immune system of the host. Differing ratios of various proportions between specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses are essential for conferring the required protection in the case of individual vaccines. To stimulate both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, the antigens must be processed and presented to both antigen-presentation pathways, MHC I and MHC II. Protein antigens delivered by vaccination are processed as extracellular antigens. However, extracellularly delivered antigen can be directed towards intracellular presentation pathways in conjugation with molecules involved in antigen cross-presentation, e.g. heat shock proteins, or by genomic-DNA vaccination. In this overview, current knowledge of the host immune response to DNA vaccines is summarized in the introduction. The subsequent sections discuss techniques for enhancing DNA vaccine efficacy, such as DNA delivery to specific tissues, delivery of DNA to the cell cytoplasm or nucleus, and enhancement of the immune response using molecular adjuvants. Finally, the prospects of DNA vaccination and ongoing clinical trials with various DNA vaccines are discussed.","Běláková, Jana; Horynová, Milada; Křupka, Michal; Weigl, Evžen; Raška, Milan",Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),84,33

Adherent cells recovered from the feline lung and peritoneal cavity phagocytosed fixed red blood cells, and formed Fc-mediated rosettes. Enhancement of virus infection by MAb was investigated by inoculating alveolar macrophages with a mixtures of viral suspension and MAb, and examining the cells for intracellular viral antigen by the immunofluorescence assay and the amount of infectious virus in the supernatant fluid after incubation. The replication of FIPV in macrophages was enhanced by non-neutralizing MAbs recognizing peplomer protein (S) and transmembrane protein (M) of the virus. Even among the MAbs having the ability to neutralize FIPV strain 79-1146, some reversely enhanced virus infection when they were diluted. The enhancement was suppressed by pretreatment of the MAb with protein A. The enhancement was reduced by the use of F(ab′)(2) fragment of MAb. These results demonstrated antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection in macrophage. The replication of FIPV 79-1146 strain in macrophages from FIPV antibody-positive cats was more enhanced than in those from antibody-negative cats.","Hohdatsu, T.; Nakamura, M.; Ishizuka, Y.; Yamada, H.; Koyama, H.",Arch Virol,84,1

5664,5664,5664,Respiratory Muscle Rehabilitation in Patients with Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation: A Targeted Approach,18.472954,10.651823,2020-03-24,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have found only a weak to moderate correlation between oxygenation and lung aeration in response to changes in PEEP. This study aimed to investigate the association between changes in shunt, low and high ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, and computed tomography-measured lung aeration following an increase in PEEP in patients with ARDS. METHODS: In this preliminary study, 12 ARDS patients were subjected to recruitment maneuvers followed by setting PEEP at 5 and then either 15 or 20 cmH(2)O. Lung aeration was measured by computed tomography. Values of pulmonary shunt and low and high V/Q mismatch were calculated by a model-based method from measurements of oxygenation, ventilation, and metabolism taken at different inspired oxygen levels and an arterial blood gas sample. RESULTS: Increasing PEEP resulted in reduced values of pulmonary shunt and the percentage of non-aerated tissue, and an increased percentage of normally aerated tissue (p < 0.05). Changes in shunt and normally aerated tissue were significantly correlated (r = − 0.665, p = 0.018). Three distinct responses to increase in PEEP were observed in values of shunt and V/Q mismatch: a beneficial response in seven patients, where shunt decreased without increasing high V/Q; a detrimental response in four patients where both shunt and high V/Q increased; and a detrimental response in a patient with reduced shunt but increased high V/Q mismatch. Non-aerated tissue decreased with increased PEEP in all patients, and hyperinflated tissue increased only in patients with a detrimental response in shunt and V/Q mismatch. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that improved lung aeration following an increase in PEEP is not always consistent with reduced shunt and V/Q mismatch. Poorly matched redistribution of ventilation and perfusion, between dependent and non-dependent regions of the lung, may explain why patients showed detrimental changes in shunt and V/Q mismatch on increase in PEEP, despite improved aeration.

The evaluation of organ severity is difficult in patients considered for cannulation in a distant hospital. This study was designed to identify early factors associated with hospital mortality in ARDS patients treated with ECMO and retrieved from referring hospitals. METHODS: Data from 85 consecutive ARDS patients equipped with ECMO by our mobile team and consequently admitted to our ICU were prospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The main ARDS etiologies were community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (35 %), influenza pneumonia (23 %) (with 12 patients having been treated during the first half of the study period), and nosocomial pneumonia (14 %). The median (interquartile range) time between contact from the referring hospital and patient cannulation was 3 (1–4) h. ECMO was venovenous in 77 (91 %) patients. No complications occurred during transport by our mobile unit. Forty-eight patients died at the hospital (56 %). Based on a multivariate logistic regression, a score including age, SOFA score, and a diagnosis of influenza pneumonia was constructed. The probability of hospital mortality following ECMO initiation was 40 % in the 0–2 score class (n = 58) and 93 % in the 3–4 score class (n = 27). Patients with an influenza pneumonia diagnosis and a SOFA score before ECMO of less than 12 had a mortality rate of 22 %. CONCLUSIONS: Age, SOFA score, and a diagnosis of influenza may be used to accurately evaluate the risk of death in ARDS patients considered for retrieval under ECMO from distant hospitals.","Roch, Antoine; Hraiech, Sami; Masson, Elodie; Grisoli, Dominique; Forel, Jean-Marie; Boucekine, Mohamed; Morera, Pierre; Guervilly, Christophe; Adda, Mélanie; Dizier, Stéphanie; Toesca, Richard; Collart, Fréderic; Papazian, Laurent",Intensive Care Med,84,12

The aim of the study was to identify predictors of mortality and to develop a score allowing a better stratification of patients at the time of VV ECMO initiation. METHODS: This was a prospective multicenter cohort study on 60 patients with influenza A (H1N1)-associated respiratory distress syndrome participating in the Italian ECMOnet data set in the 2009 pandemic. Criteria for ECMO institution were standardized according to national guidelines. RESULTS: The survival rate in patients treated with ECMO was 68 %. Significant predictors of death before ECMO institution by multivariate analysis were hospital length of stay before ECMO institution (OR = 1.52, 95 % CI 1.12–2.07, p = 0.008); bilirubin (OR = 2.32, 95 % CI 1.52–3.52, p < 0.001), creatinine (OR = 7.38, 95 % CI 1.43–38.11, p = 0.02) and hematocrit values (OR = 0.82, 95 % CI 0.72–0.94, p = 0.006); and mean arterial pressure (OR = 0.92, 95 % CI 0.88–0.97, p < 0.001). The ECMOnet score was developed based on these variables, with a score of 4.5 being the most appropriate cutoff for mortality risk prediction. The high accuracy of the ECMOnet score was further confirmed by ROC analysis (c = 0.857, 95 % CI 0.754–0.959, p < 0.001) and by an independent external validation analysis (c = 0.694, 95 % CI 0.562–0.826, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality risk for patients receiving VV ECMO is correlated to the extrapulmonary organ function at the time of ECMO initiation. The ECMOnet score is a tool for the evaluation of the appropriateness and timing of VV ECMO in acute lung failure.

Aortic wall weakness and abnormal aortic hemodynamic profiles predispose these patients to dilatation of the thoracic aorta, which is generally silent but can precipitate aortic dissection or rupture with devastating and often fatal consequences. Current strategies to assess the future risk of aortic dissection or rupture are based primarily on monitoring aortic diameter. However, diameter alone is a poor predictor of risk, with many patients experiencing dissection or rupture below current intervention thresholds. Developing tools that improve the risk assessment of those with aortopathy is internationally regarded as a research priority. A robust understanding of the molecular pathways that lead to aortic wall weakness is required to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets that could improve patient management. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the genetically determined mechanisms underlying inherited aortopathies and critically appraise the available blood biomarkers, imaging techniques, and therapeutic targets that have shown promise for improving the management of patients with these important and potentially fatal conditions.","Fletcher, Alexander J.; Syed, Maaz B.J.; Aitman, Timothy J.; Newby, David E.; Walker, Niki L.",Circulation,84,27

METHODS: Medical records of patients ≤26 years old receiving CD19 CAR T-cell infusion (CTI) at a single institution between 2014 and 2017 were reviewed. The number of infections per 100 days-at-risk (infection density) in the 90 days preceding and 0–28 and 29–90 days after CTI was calculated. Poisson regression and Cox analyses were utilized to identify risk factors for infections. RESULTS: Eighty-three patients received CTI during the study period. Most patients (98%) had refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Infections occurred in 54% of patients in the 90 days before CTI (infection density, 1.23) and in 40% of patients in the first 28 days following CTI (infection density, 2.89). Infection density decreased to 0.55 in the 29–90 days post-CTI. Most infections were bacteremias (39%) or respiratory viral infections (43%). Pre-CTI risk factors associated with infection included prior hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), immunoglobulin G (IgG) level <400 mg/dL, and lymphodepletion other than cyclophosphamide plus fludarabine; post-CTI risk factors included higher-severity CRS and IgG <400 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: Infection rates in children and young adults receiving CD19 CAR T-cell therapy increase in the first month and then decline. Understanding types and timing of infections and contributing risk factors may help inform prophylactic and monitoring strategies. Specific attention should be given to patients with prior HCT, severe hypogammaglobulinemia, and severe CRS.","Vora, Surabhi B; Waghmare, Alpana; Englund, Janet A; Qu, Pingping; Gardner, Rebecca A; Hill, Joshua A",Open Forum Infect Dis,84,1

Modifiable risk factors of dementia and AD include lifestyle-related factors, vascular and metabolic disorders, and psychosocial factors. Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are needed to clarify whether modifying such factors can prevent or postpone cognitive impairment and dementia in older adults. Given the complex, multifactorial, and heterogeneous nature of late-onset AD and dementia, interventions targeting several risk factors and mechanisms simultaneously may be required for optimal preventive effects. The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) is the first large, long-term RCT to demonstrate that a multidomain lifestyle-based intervention ameliorating vascular and lifestyle-related risk factors can preserve cognitive functioning and reduce the risk of cognitive decline among older adults at increased risk of dementia. To investigate the multidomain intervention in other populations and diverse cultural and geographical settings, the World-Wide FINGERS (WW-FINGERS) network was recently launched (https://alz.org/wwfingers). Within this network, new FINGER-type trials with shared core methodology, but local culture and context-specific adaptations, will be conducted in several countries. The WW-FINGERS initiative facilitates international collaborations, provides a platform for testing multidomain strategies to prevent cognitive impairment and dementia, and aims at generating high-quality scientific evidence to support public health and clinical decision-making. Furthermore, the WW-FINGERS network can support the implementation of preventive strategies and translation of research findings into practice.","Rosenberg, A.; Mangialasche, F.; Ngandu, T.; Solomon, A.; Kivipelto, Miia",J Prev Alzheimers Dis,84,1

To aid clinicians in consistently selecting lung- and diaphragm-protective ventilation settings, a physiology-based decision support system is needed. To form the foundation of such a system, a comprehensive physiological model which captures the dynamics of ventilation has been developed. The Lung and Diaphragm Protective Ventilation (LDPV) model centers around respiratory drive and incorporates respiratory system mechanics, ventilator mechanics, and blood acid–base balance. The model uses patient-specific parameters as inputs and outputs predictions of a patient’s transpulmonary and esophageal driving pressures (outputs most clinically relevant to lung and diaphragm safety), as well as their blood pH, under various ventilator and sedation conditions. Model simulations and global optimization techniques were used to evaluate and characterize the model. The LDPV model is demonstrated to describe a CO(2) respiratory response that is comparable to what is found in literature. Sensitivity analysis of the model indicate that the ventilator and sedation settings incorporated in the model have a significant impact on the target output parameters. Finally, the model is seen to be able to provide robust predictions of esophageal pressure, transpulmonary pressure and blood pH for patient parameters with realistic variability. The LDPV model is a robust physiological model which produces outputs which directly target and reflect the risk of ventilator-induced lung and diaphragm injury. Ventilation and sedation parameters are seen to modulate the model outputs in accordance with what is currently known in literature.

Several studies have suggested that Tai Chi and Qigong (TQ) have positive impacts on the immune system and its response to inflammation. The aim of this review is to evaluate the current evidence of the effects of TQ on these parameters. Methods: Electronic searches were conducted on databases (Medline, PubMed, Embase and ScienceDirect). Searches were performed using the following keywords: “Tai Chi or Qigong” and “immune system, immune function, immunity, Immun*, inflammation and cytokines”. Studies published as full-text randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in English were included. Estimates of change in the levels of immune cells and inflammatory biomarkers were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis where randomised comparisons were available for TQ versus active controls and TQ versus non-active controls. Results: Nineteen RCTs were selected for review with a total of 1686 participants and a range of 32 to 252 participants within the studies. Overall, a random-effects meta-analysis found that, compared with control conditions, TQ has a significant small effect of increasing the levels of immune cells (SMD, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.43, p = 0.00), I(2) = 45%, but not a significant effect on reducing the levels of inflammation (SMD, −0.15; 95% CI, −0.39 to 0.09, p = 0.21), I(2) = 85%, as measured by the systemic inflammation biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP) and cell mediated biomarker cytokines. This difference in results is due to the bidirectional regulation of cytokines. An overall risk of bias assessment found three RCTs with a low risk of bias, six RCTs with some concerns of bias, and ten RCTs with a high risk of bias. Conclusions: Current evidence indicates that practising TQ has a physiologic impact on immune system functioning and inflammatory responses. Rigorous studies are needed to guide clinical guidelines and harness the power of TQ to promote health and wellbeing.","Oh, Byeongsang; Bae, Kyeore; Lamoury, Gillian; Eade, Thomas; Boyle, Frances; Corless, Brian; Clarke, Stephen; Yeung, Albert; Rosenthal, David; Schapira, Lidia; Back, Michael",Medicines (Basel),84,27

In 2018, China’s national medical security systems were integrated, while MIISs were facing reconstruction. We summarized China’s experience in medical insurance informatization over the past 20 years, aiming to provide a reference for the building of a new basic MIS for China and for developing countries. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to sort out medical insurance informatization policies throughout the years, use questionnaires to determine the status quo of provincial MIIS-building in China and the relevant policies, provide references and suggestions for the top-level design and implementation of the information systems in the transitional period of China’s MIS reform, and provide a reference for the building of MIISs in developing countries. METHODS: We conducted policy analysis by collecting the laws, regulations, and policy documents—issued from 1998 to 2020—on China's medical insurance and its informatization; we also analyzed the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and other relevant policies. We conducted a questionnaire survey by sending out questionnaires to 31 Chinese, provincial, medical security bureaus to collect information about network links, system functions, data exchange, standards and specifications, and building modes, among other items. We conducted a literature review by searching for documents about relevant laws and policies, building methods, application results, and other documents related to MIISs; we conducted searches using PubMed, Elsevier, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and other major literature databases. We conducted telephone interviews to verify the results of questionnaires and to understand the focus issues concerning the building of China’s national MIISs during the period of integration and transition of China's MIS. RESULTS: In 74% (23/31) of the regions in China, MIISs were networked through dedicated fiber optic lines. In 65% (20/31) of the regions in China, MIISs supported identity recognition based on both ID cards and social security cards. In 55% (17/31) of the regions in China, MIISs at provincial and municipal levels were networked and have gathered basic medical insurance data, whereas MIISs were connected to health insurance companies in 35% (11/31) of the regions in China. China’s MIISs are comprised of 11 basic functional modules, among which the modules of business operation, transregional referral, reimbursement, and monitoring systems are widely applied. MIISs in 83% (20/24) of Chinese provinces have stored data on coverage, payment, and settlement compensation of medical insurance. However, in terms of data security and privacy protection, pertinent policies are absent and data utilization is not in-depth enough. Respondents to telephone interviews universally reflected on the following issues and suggestions: in the period of integration and transition of MISs, close attention should be paid to the top-level design, and repeated investment should be avoided for the building of MIISs; MIISs should be adapted to the health care reform, and efforts should be made to strengthen the informatization support for the reform of payment methods; and MIISs should be adapted for the widespread application of mobile phones and should provide insured persons with more self-service functions. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, the building of China’s basic MIISs should be deployed at the national, provincial, prefectural, and municipal levels on a unified basis. Efforts should be made to strengthen the development of standard codes, data exchange, and data utilization. Work should be done to formulate the rules and regulations for security and privacy protection and to balance the right to be informed with the mining and utilization of big data. Efforts should be made to intensify the interconnectivity between MISs and other health systems and to strengthen the application of medical insurance information in public health monitoring and early warning systems; this would ultimately improve the degree of trust from stakeholders, including individuals, medical service providers, and public health institutions, in the basic MIISs.","Li, Yazi; Lu, Chunji; Liu, Yang",JMIR Med Inform,84,12

Our objective was to describe the respiratory, growth, and survival outcomes of infants with tracheostomy. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 204 infants born between 2005 and 2015 with tracheostomy at <1 year of age and follow-up in the Infant Tracheostomy and Home Ventilator Clinic up to 4 years of age. RESULTS: The mean age at tracheostomy was 4.5 months with median age of 3 months. Median age of decannulation was 32 months. The time from tracheostomy placement to complete discontinuation of mechanical ventilation was 15.4 months and from tracheostomy to decannulation was 33.8 months. Mortality rate was 21% and median age of death was 18 months. Preterm infants with acquired airway and lung disease (BPD) and born at <28 weeks’ gestation had a significantly higher survival rate compared to term infants. The z-scores for weight and weight for length improved from the time of discharge (mean chronological age 6.5 months) to first year and remained consistent through 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Premature infants had a higher rate of discontinuation of mechanical ventilation and decannulation compared to term infants. These infants showed consistent growth and comparable survival rate. IMPACT: Infants with tracheostomy and ventilator dependence followed in a multidisciplinary clinic model may have improved survival, growth, and earlier time to decannulation. Preterm infants with acquired airway and lung disease (BPD) with tracheostomy had a higher survival rate compared to term infants with various tracheostomy indications.

In the present study we demonstrate for the first time that 1-methyl nicotinamide (MNA), a derivative of vitamin B(3), significantly (1.6 to 1.9 times) prolonged survival of BALB/c mice irradiated at LD(30/30) (6.5 Gy), LD(50/30) (7.0 Gy) or LD(80/30) (7.5 Gy) of γ-rays when the MNA administration started as late as 7 days post irradiation. A slightly less efficient and only after the highest dose (7.5 Gy) of γ-rays was another vitamin B(3) derivative, 1-methyl-3-acetylpyridine (1,3-MAP) (1.4-fold prolonged survival). These pro-survival effects did not seem to be mediated by stimulation of haematopoiesis, but might be related to anti-inflammatory and/or anti-thrombotic properties of the vitamin B(3) derivatives.

Traditional healers in SSA are frequently exposed to bloodborne pathogens through the widespread practice of traditional ‘injections’, in which the healers perform dozens of subcutaneous incisions to rub herbs directly into the bloodied tissue with their hands. Healers who report exposure to patient blood have a 2.2-fold higher risk of being HIV-positive than those who do not report exposure. We propose a randomized controlled trial (61 healers in the intervention group and 61 healers in the control group) in Mpumalanga Province. Healers will receive personal protective equipment (PPE) education and training, general HIV prevention education, and three educational outreach visits at the healer’s place of practice to provide advice and support for PPE use and disposal. Healers in the control arm will be trained by health care providers, while participants in the intervention arm will receive training and outreach from a team of healers who were early adopters of PPE. We will evaluate intervention implementation using data from surveys, observation, and educational assessments. Implementation outcomes of interest include acceptability and feasibility of PPE use during clinical encounters and fidelity of PPE use during treatments that involve blood exposure. We will test our two intervention strategies to identify an optimal strategy for PPE education in a region with high HIV prevalence.","Audet, Carolyn M.; Shepherd, Bryan E.; Aliyu, Muktar H.; Moshabela, Mosa; Pettapiece-Phillips, Mariah J.; Wagner, Ryan G.",,84,12

Due to their lower tidal volumes and functional residual capacities the deposited mass is smaller while the tissue concentrations are larger in the infant and child subjects, compared to the adult. Furthermore, we find that dose cannot be predicted by simply scaling by tidal volumes. These results highlight the need for additional clinical and computational studies that investigate the efficiency of treatment, while optimizing dosage levels in order to alleviate side effects, in youth.","Poorbahrami, Kamran; Vignon-Clementel, Irene E.; Shadden, Shawn C.; Oakes, Jessica M.",Sci Rep,84,12

However, different visions, based on distinct biological interests, have led to the development of multiple ways to describe and annotate causal molecular interactions. It can therefore be challenging to efficiently explore various resources of causal interaction and maintain an overview of recorded contextual information that ensures valid use of the data. This review lists the different types of public resources with causal interactions, the different views on biological processes that they represent, the various data formats they use for data representation and storage, and the data exchange and conversion procedures that are available to extract and download these interactions.

A rationale approach is to target antigen to specific receptors on dendritic cells (DC) via fused monoclonal antibodies (mAb). In mouse and non-human primate models, targeting of skin Langerhans cells (LC) with anti-Langerin mAbs fused with HIV-1 Gag antigen drives antigen-specific humoral responses. The development of these immunization strategies in humans requires a better understanding of early immune events driven by human LC. We therefore produced anti-Langerin mAbs fused with the HIV-1 gp140z Envelope (αLC.Env). First, we show that primary skin human LC and in vitro differentiated LC induce differentiation and expansion of naïve CD4(+) T cells into T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Second, when human LC are pre-treated with αLC.Env, differentiated Tfh cells significantly promote the production of specific IgG by B cells. Strikingly, HIV-Env-specific Ig are secreted by HIV-specific memory B cells. Consistently, we found that receptors and cytokines involved in Tfh differentiation and B cell functions are upregulated by LC during their maturation and after targeting Langerin. Finally, we show that subcutaneous immunization of mice by αLC.Env induces germinal center (GC) reaction in draining lymph nodes with higher numbers of Tfh cells, Env-specific B cells, as well as specific IgG serum levels compared to mice immunized with the non-targeting Env antigen. Altogether, we provide evidence that human LC properly targeted may be licensed to efficiently induce Tfh cell and B cell responses in GC.","Kervevan, Jérôme; Bouteau, Aurélie; Lanza, Juliane S.; Hammoudi, Adele; Zurawski, Sandra; Surenaud, Mathieu; Dieudonné, Lydie; Bonnet, Marion; Lefebvre, Cécile; Hocini, Hakim; Marlin, Romain; Guguin, Aurélie; Hersant, Barbara; Hermeziu, Oana; Menu, Elisabeth; Lacabaratz, Christine; Lelièvre, Jean-Daniel; Zurawski, Gerard; Godot, Véronique; Henri, Sandrine; Igyártó, Botond Z.; Levy, Yves; Cardinaud, Sylvain",PLoS Pathog,84,19

Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is commonly used in patients with ARDS but the best method to select the optimal PEEP level and reduce all-cause mortality is unclear. The primary objective of this network meta-analysis is to summarize the available evidence and to compare the effect of different PEEP selection strategies on all-cause mortality in adult patients with ARDS. METHODS: We will search MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, and LILACS from inception onwards for randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of PEEP selection strategies in adult patients with moderate to severe ARDS. We will exclude studies that did not use a lung-protective ventilation approach as part of the comparator or intervention strategy. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality (at the longest available follow-up and up to 90 days). Secondary outcomes will include barotrauma, ventilator-free days, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, and changes in oxygenation. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and extract study-data. We will assess the risk of bias for each of the outcomes using version 2 of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized controlled trials. If feasible, Bayesian network meta-analyses will be conducted to obtain pooled estimates of all potential head-to-head comparisons. We will report pairwise and network meta-analysis treatment effect estimates as risk ratios and risk differences, together with the associated 95% credible intervals. We will assess certainty in effect estimates using GRADE methodology. DISCUSSION: The present study will inform clinical decision-making for adult patients with ARDS and will improve our understanding of the limitations of the available literature assessing PEEP selection strategies.

There is still no effective vaccine or treatment to date. Previous studies showed that mosquito-derived factors present in saliva or salivary gland extract (SGE) contribute to the pathogenesis of dengue. In this study, we aimed to investigate the interplay between mosquito vector and DENV and to address the question of whether the mosquito vector alters the virus that leads to consequential disease manifestations in the mammalian host. DENV2 cultured in C6/36 cell line (culture-DENV2) was injected to Aedes aegypti intrathoracically. Saliva was collected from infected mosquitoes 7 days later. Exploiting the sensitivity of Stat1(-/-) mice to low dose of DENV2 delivered intradermally, we showed that DENV2 collected in infected mosquito saliva (msq-DENV2) induced more severe hemorrhage in mice than their culture counterpart. Msq-DENV2 was characterized by smaller particle size, larger plaque size and more rapid growth in mosquito as well as mammalian cell lines compared to culture-DENV2. In addition, msq-DENV2 was more efficient than culture-DENV2 in inducing Tnf mRNA production by mouse macrophage. Together, our results point to the possibility that the mosquito vector provides an environment that alters DENV2 by changing its growth characteristics as well as its potential to cause disease.","Cheang, Ka Wan; Chen, Wen-Yu; Wu-Hsieh, Betty A.; Shiao, Shin-Hong",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,84,12

The standard medical treatment is the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). All characterized SSRIs are competitive inhibitors of the serotonin transporter (SERT). A non-competitive inhibitor may produce a more favorable therapeutic profile. Vilazodone is an antidepressant with limited information on its molecular interactions with SERT. Here we use molecular pharmacology and cryo-EM structural elucidation to characterize vilazodone binding to SERT. We find that it exhibits non-competitive inhibition of serotonin uptake and impedes dissociation of [(3)H]imipramine at low nanomolar concentrations. Our SERT structure with bound imipramine and vilazodone reveals a unique binding pocket for vilazodone, expanding the boundaries of the extracellular vestibule. Characterization of the binding site is substantiated with molecular dynamics simulations and systematic mutagenesis of interacting residues resulting in decreased vilazodone binding to the allosteric site. Our findings underline the versatility of SERT allosteric ligands and describe the unique binding characteristics of vilazodone.","Plenge, Per; Yang, Dongxue; Salomon, Kristine; Laursen, Louise; Kalenderoglou, Iris E.; Newman, Amy H.; Gouaux, Eric; Coleman, Jonathan A.; Loland, Claus J.",Nat Commun,84,3

However, whether and how Dex affects breast cancer metastasis remain to be furtherly understood. In this study, we established several mouse breast cancer metastatic models to study the effect of Dex in vitro and in vivo. Transwell, Western Blot and RNA interference were applied to study the molecular mechanism of Dex in promoting breast cancer cell migration. Meanwhile, the effect of Dex on lung metastasis of breast cancer in Dex combined with PTX chemotherapy was discussed. Our results confirmed that Dex could promote breast cancer cell metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that this pro-metastatic effect of Dex was mediated by the GR-PI3K-SGK1-CTGF pathway in tumor cells. Ligation of Dex and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) on tumor cells activated the PI3K signaling pathway and upregulated serum glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) expression, and then increased the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) through Nedd4l-Smad2. Moreover, Dex was the leading factor for lung metastasis in a standard regimen for breast cancer treatment with paclitaxel and Dex. Importantly, targeting SGK1 with the inhibitor GSK650394 remarkably reduced lung metastasis in this regimen. Our present data provide new insights into Dex-induced breast cancer metastasis and indicate that SGK1 could be a candidate target for the treatment of breast cancer metastasis.","Zhang, Yujing; Shi, Gang; Zhang, Hantao; Xiong, Qi; Cheng, Fuyi; Wang, Huiling; Luo, Jieyan; Zhang, Yong; Shi, Pengyi; Xu, Jia; Fu, Jiamei; Chen, Na; Cheng, Lin; Li, Yiming; Dai, Lei; Yang, Yang; Yu, Dechao; Zhang, Shuang; Deng, Hongxin",Oncogene,84,1

In the present paper, we focus on a method to estimate inner soil structure via wave propagation analysis. It is regarded as one of the parameter optimization approaches using observation data on the surface. This application is in great demand to ensure better reliability in numerical simulations. Typical optimization requires many forward analyses; thus, massive computation cost is required. We propose an approach to substitute evaluation using neural networks for most cases of forward analyses and to reduce the number of forward analyses. Forward analyses in the proposed method are used for producing the training data for a neural network; thereby they can be computed independently, and the actual elapsed time can be reduced by using a large-scale supercomputer. We demonstrated that the inner soil structure was estimated with the sufficient accuracy for practical damage evaluation. We also confirmed that the proposed method achieved estimating parameters within a shorter timeframe compared to a typical approach based on simulated annealing.","Yamaguchi, Takuma; Ichimura, Tsuyoshi; Fujita, Kohei; Hori, Muneo; Wijerathne, Lalith; Ueda, Naonori",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,84,12

In the shorter run, most SMEs have faced logistical challenges in addition to demand disruptions, although the severity has differed across firms and industries. We argue that in the longer-term, there will be different challenges and opportunities depending on the type of SME. Policy interventions will also need to be sensitive to the different types of SMEs, rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all approach.

MAIN BODY: The article offers a legal analysis of the SA MTA and focuses on its substantive fit with the broader legal environment in South Africa, and the clarity and practicality of its terms. The following problematic aspects of the SA MTA are highlighted: (a) Where only data and no human biological material are transferred, the SA MTA does not apply, leaving a lacuna; (b) Health Research Ethics Committees are required to be parties to a MTA despite it being outside their legal mandate and undermining their oversight function; (c) the SA MTA’s consent provisions are not aligned with extant law; and, similarly, (d) its provision on donor ownership is misaligned with extant law; (e) its creation of fictitious performance can only cause frustration on the part of an injured party; (f) its benefit-sharing provision is vague and will have little practical effect; (g) its dispute-resolution provisions fail to adequately protect South African research institutions and research participants; (h) it fails to provide substantive guidance regarding intellectual property as its provisions relating to intellectual property may cause practical problems; and, finally, (i) its data privacy provision is insufficiently specific, is overbroad, and fails to provide terms that in general would facilitate the international sharing of human biological material and associated data in terms of existing privacy law. CONCLUSIONS: While some of the problematic aspects of the SA MTA are intricate and require consultative processes with stakeholders and others, to develop comprehensive solutions, most of the problematic aspects can be resolved immediately through amendments by the South African Minister of Health. The formulation of such amendments is proposed and, where possible, interim measures are suggested that may ameliorate the problems presented by the SA MTA.","Thaldar, Donrich W.; Botes, Marietjie; Nienaber, Annelize",BMC Med Ethics,84,12

Prior research shows that bootstrap financing is an important enabler for the growth of resource-constrained early-stage ventures. However, little is known about the use of bootstrap financing in crises, during which the preservation of liquidity is particularly salient. We investigate the determinants of bootstrap financing in the 2020 COVID-19 crisis using a sample of 17,046 German entrepreneurial ventures. We formulate hypotheses about the determinants of bootstrap financing from a necessity, human capital, and opportunity cost perspective. Among others, our results show that the severity of the crisis for the venture, the level of private consumption, and self-employment experience are positively associated with an increased use of bootstrap financing measures. Our study contributes to the literature on bootstrap financing and illuminates how entrepreneurial ventures maintain liquidity in crises. Plain English Summary Economic downturns or crises often lead to financial distress for ventures. To survive such tumultuous times, ventures need to preserve their liquidity. Bootstrap financing refers to measures that entrepreneurial ventures take to preserve liquidity (like sending payment reminders, paying invoices later, reducing tax advances, reducing commercial rent). Because little is known about how bootstrap financing is used during crises, we investigate how it was used during the COVID-19 crisis. Our study builds on a survey of 17,046 German entrepreneurial ventures and self-employed individuals. We find that the use of bootstrap financing is positively related to how severe the crisis was for the venture along with the level of private consumption and self-employment experience of the venture’s owner. In contrast, a negative association exists with private liquidity, business liquidity, how long before the owner retires, and part-time self-employment. The positive association between self-employment experience and bootstrap financing indicates that targeted entrepreneurship education programs or webinars should focus on inexperienced entrepreneurs so that these individuals are prepared to use bootstrapping methods to maintain liquidity during crises.","Block, Joern H.; Fisch, Christian; Hirschmann, Mirko",Small Bus Econ,84,0

OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy of indirect immunofluorescence technique (IIF) with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify respiratory viruses in children hospitalized for ARI. METHODS 47 nasopharyngeal aspirates of children ≤ 2 years with ARI were included. IFI included respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, influenza A and B and parainfluenza. PCR also included the detection of metapneumovirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus, bocavirus and coronavirus. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (VPP/NPV) and kappa correlation for RSV were estimated by IIF compared to PCR. RESULTS The IIF detected only RSV (29; 61.7%). PCR detected several viruses, including RSV in 26 cases (55.3%), followed by bocavirus (29.8%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (21.3%), adenovirus (14.9%) and parainfluenza (4,3%) among others, with 35.5% of coinfection. The IIF presented sensitivity: 85.7%, specificity: 73.6%, PPV: 82.7%, NPV: 77.7% and kappa: 0.5990 (95% CI, 0.3636-0.8346) for RSV. CONCLUSION The IIF presents good sensitivity, but moderate specificity for RSV. However, IIF fails to detect other respiratory viruses.

The most prominent of these viruses is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which causes acute respiratory and gastrointestinal infection in humans. The coronavirus main protease, 3CL(pro), is a key target for broad-spectrum antiviral development because of its critical role in viral maturation and high degree of structural conservation among coronaviruses. Dimerization is an indispensable requirement for the function of SARS 3CL(pro) and is regulated through mechanisms involving both direct and long-range interactions in the enzyme. While many of the binding interactions at the dimerization interface have been extensively studied, those that are important for long-range control are not well-understood. Characterization of these dimerization mechanisms is important for the structure-based design of new treatments targeting coronavirus-based infections. Here we report that Asn28, a residue 11 A from the closest residue in the opposing monomer, is essential for the enzymatic activity and dimerization of SARS 3CL(pro). Mutation of this residue to alanine almost completely inactivates the enzyme and results in a 19.2-fold decrease in the dimerization K(d). The crystallographic structure of the N28A mutant determined at 2.35 A resolution reveals the critical role of Asn28 in maintaining the structural integrity of the active site and in orienting key residues involved in binding at the dimer interface and substrate catalysis. These findings provide deeper insight into complex mechanisms regulating the activity and dimerization of SARS 3CL(pro).","Barrila, Jennifer; Gabelli, Sandra B; Bacha, Usman; Amzel, L Mario; Freire, Ernesto",Biochemistry,84,16

In the present study, we consider assessing stress response in emergency health workers, measuring related biomarkers such as cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and salivary α-amylase during the whole working day. METHOD An analytical, descriptive and cross-sectional study was carried out. The study was conducted in the emergency rooms of two public hospitals. Ninety-seven professionals participated, 45 corresponding to one hospital and 52 to the other. Four salivary samples were obtained according to circadian rhythms: at 8:00, 12:00, 15:00 and 00:00 h/24 h. The data were subsequently analyzed. RESULTS Cortisol levels decreased throughout the working day, with minimum values being at 24 h. A similar pattern was observed in DHEA. The α-amylase levels increased throughout the working day, reaching its peak at 15:00 h, and decreasing at 24 h, compared to the data from the rest of the working day. CONCLUSIONS Since reference/baseline values are not presented, this work is focused on a stress situation experienced during one regular working day in emergency rooms with no extreme situations. In this context, stress, measured through cortisol and α-amylase, is present in emergency room doctors and nurses. However, the increase in DHEA, due to its anabolic condition, could counteract their effect, suggesting a positive effect on their professional actions.","Pérez-Valdecantos, Daniel; Caballero-García, Alberto; Del Castillo-Sanz, Teodosia; Bello, Hugo J; Roche, Enrique; Córdova, Alfredo",International journal of environmental research and public health,84,19

METHODS We included 10,861 patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to the Northwell Health system hospitals during the period of March 1 to April 27, 2020. BMI was classified as: underweight, normal, overweight, obesity class I, II, and III. Primary outcomes are invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and death. RESULTS There were 243 (2.2%) underweight, 2,507 (23.1%) normal weight, 4,021 (37.0%) overweight, 2,345 (21.6%) obesity class I, 990 (9.1%) obesity class II, and 755 (7.0%) obesity class III patients. Patients who are overweight (OR=1.27[95% CI, 1.11-1.46]), obesity class I (OR=1.48 [95% CI, 1.27-1.72]), obesity class II (OR=1.89[95% CI, 1.56-2.28]), and obesity class III (OR=2.31 [95% CI, 1.88-2.85]) had increased risk of requiring IMV. Underweight and obesity classes II and III were statistically associated with death (OR=1.44 [95% CI, 1.08-1.92]; OR=1.25 [95% CI 1.03-1.52]; OR=1.61 [95% CI 1.30-2.00], respectively). Among patients who were on IMV, BMI was not associated with inpatient deaths. CONCLUSION Patients who are underweight or with obesity are at a risk for mechanical ventilation and death, suggesting pulmonary complications (indicated by IMV) is a significant contributor for poor outcomes in COVID-19 infection.","Kim, Tara; Roslin, Mitchell; Wang, Jason J; Kane, Jamie; Hirsch, Jamie S; Ji Kim, Eun",Obesity,84,29

Patients commonly present with negative beliefs about low back pain and this can have detrimental effects on their health outcomes. Providing evidence-based, patient-centred education that meets patient needs could help address these negative beliefs and alleviate the substantial low back pain burden. The primary aim of this review is to investigate the effectiveness of patient education materials on immediate process, clinical and health system outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The search strategy was developed in collaboration with a librarian and systematic searches will be performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and SPORTDiscus. We will also search trial registries and grey literature through the OpenGrey database. Study selection will include a title and abstract scan and full-text review by two authors. Only randomised controlled trials will be included in this review. Trials must include patients with low back pain or sciatica and investigate educational interventions with at least one of the following contrasts: (1) education alone versus no intervention; (2) education alone versus another intervention; (3) education in addition to another intervention versus the same intervention with no education. Data extraction, risk of bias and grading of the quality of evidence will be performed independently by two reviewers. Risk of bias will be assessed using the PEDro scale, and the quality of evidence will be assessed with the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. A random-effects model will be used for each contrast, and results will be pooled if the participants, interventions, and outcomes are homogeneous. If heterogeneity is high (I2 >75%), we will evaluate the magnitude and direction of the differences in effect sizes across studies to determine if it remains reasonable to pool the results. Analyses of acute and subacute low back pain (less than 12 weeks duration) will be performed separately from chronic low back pain (12 weeks or greater duration). Likewise, analyses of short-term (less than 6 months) and long-term (6 months or greater) follow-up will be performed separately. Subgroup analyses will be performed on non-specific low back pain, sciatica and mixed populations. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required for this review.

This study analyzed EDA changes due to pain stimulus in sedated adult critical care patients Methods: Skin conductance variability, selected hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, Bispectral index (BIS) and ambient noise level, were monitored during 4 hour routine daytime in an adult ICU. 4h-Measurements were divided into 2 groups, based upon the sedation level of the patients: Group A - Ramsay Sedation Score 2-4 and Group B - Ramsay Sedation Score of 5-6. Selected recordings before and after pain stimulus were performed. The stimulus chosen was the pressure applied to nail bed for 10 sec, which was performed routinely during neurological examination. Patients' demographics, laboratory exams and severity scores were recorded. Pain status evaluation before every event was also performed by 2 independent observers via Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) and Adult Non Verbal Pain Score (ANVPS) Results: In both groups the rate of EDA changes was greater than other monitoring parameters: more in Group A than in Group B. Yet, the difference between groups was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION EDA measurements are greater to pain stimuli, than cardiovascular, respiratory or even BIS monitoring. These encouraging results suggest that, further studies are needed to better define EDA role in ICU.","Aslanidis, Theodoros; Grosomanidis, Vasilios; Karakoulas, Konstantinos; Chatzisotiriou, Athanasios",Acta medica,84,31

Proportional assist ventilation (PAV) offers inspiratory assistance proportional to patient effort, minimizing patient-ventilator asynchrony. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of respiratory mechanics and patient effort on patient-ventilator asynchrony during PSV and PAV plus (PAV+). METHODS We used a mechanical lung simulator and studied 3 respiratory mechanics profiles (normal, obstructive, and restrictive), with variations in the duration of inspiratory effort: 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 s. The Auto-Trak system was studied in ventilators when available. Outcome measures included inspiratory trigger delay, expiratory trigger asynchrony, and tidal volume (VT). RESULTS Inspiratory trigger delay was greater in the obstructive respiratory mechanics profile and greatest with a effort of 2.0 s (160 ms); cycling asynchrony, particularly delayed cycling, was common in the obstructive profile, whereas the restrictive profile was associated with premature cycling. In comparison with PSV, PAV+ improved patient-ventilator synchrony, with a shorter triggering delay (28 ms vs 116 ms) and no cycling asynchrony in the restrictive profile. VT was lower with PAV+ than with PSV (630 mL vs 837 mL), as it was with the single-limb circuit ventilator (570 mL vs 837 mL). PAV+ mode was associated with longer cycling delays than were the other ventilation modes, especially for the obstructive profile and higher effort values. Auto-Trak eliminated automatic triggering. CONCLUSIONS Mechanical ventilation asynchrony was influenced by effort, respiratory mechanics, ventilator type, and ventilation mode. In PSV mode, delayed cycling was associated with shorter effort in obstructive respiratory mechanics profiles, whereas premature cycling was more common with longer effort and a restrictive profile. PAV+ prevented premature cycling but not delayed cycling, especially in obstructive respiratory mechanics profiles, and it was associated with a lower VT.","Vasconcelos, Renata S; Sales, Raquel P; Melo, Luíz H de P; Marinho, Liégina S; Bastos, Vasco Pd; Nogueira, Andréa da Nc; Ferreira, Juliana C; Holanda, Marcelo A",Respiratory care,84,1

Albeit curable, PTB continues to negatively affect patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and functioning even after cure. Objectives To describe the demographics, respiratory symptoms, pulmonary airflow patterns, HRQoL and exercise capacity of cured PTB patients, in the Breede Valley district of South Africa. Methods A cross-sectional study conducted at five primary health care facilities included adult patients diagnosed with PTB, who had completed anti-tuberculosis treatment. Post-treatment bronchodilator lung function, HRQoL and 6-min walk distance (6MWD) were measured. Results Three hundred and twenty-four patients were screened. Specific challenges resulted in 45 patients being included (male n = 25 [56%]; mean population age 39.9 [± 10.2]). HRQoL was assessed using the short-form 12v2, part of the burden of lung disease core questionnaire. In general, self-reported physical scores (physical health component summary score = 45) were higher than mental scores (mental health component summary score = 39). The mean 6MWD was 294.5 m (± 122.7) m (range 110 m - 600 m), which is well below normal reference values. Forty-eight percent (48%) of the sample presented with abnormal lung function, including obstructive (n = 9; 21%), restrictive (n = 11; 25%) and mixed (n = 1; 2%). Conclusions This pilot study suggests that most cured PTB patients have decreased HRQoL, exercise capacity and abnormal lung function. This study is the first to describe the combination of these three outcomes in a South African population. Clinical implications Clinicians must recognise that holistic management of PTB patients is required after cure.","Daniels, Kurt J; Irusen, Elvis; Pharaoh, Hamilton; Hanekom, Susan",The South African journal of physiotherapy,84,33

In our University Hospital Unit, the first patient with COVID-19 was admitted on the 8th of March 2020. We aimed to investigate the predictors of death among inpatients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective, monocentric study, consecutively enrolling patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were collected from the 8th of March to the 8th of April 2020. We aimed to describe the most frequent clinical and laboratory features and predictors of death among patients admitted to our Unit. RESULTS 87 patients were enrolled, 56 (64.4%) were male, with a median age of 72 (IQR 62.5-83.5) years. The majority of our population had at least one comorbidity in their medical anamnesis. Hypertension and cardiovascular disease were the most frequent, followed by obesity. Eighty (92%) patients had at least one symptom, whereas 7 (8%) were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were fever and dyspnoea. Overall, 53 patients had lung disease confirmed at CT scan (60.9%). Twenty-five (28.7%) deaths occurred. Statistically significant predictors of death at multivariate analysis were lymphocytes count <900 cells/mm3, moderate ARDS, and lack of compliance at baseline. CONCLUSIONS This is the first Italian experience available. Our results seem to be in line with international literature. As highlighted by our data, more studies are needed to investigate the role of lymphocytes subsets, CT scan values. Furthermore, therapy choice and timing in this challenging setting should be urgently investigated in randomized clinical trials.","De Vito, A; Geremia, N; Fiore, V; Princic, E; Babudieri, S; Madeddu, G",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,84,16

Knowledge about the influence of baseline clinical and analytical factors on therapy outcomes is scarce. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a multicenter retrospective study involving 119 previously treated or untreated mUC patients under anti-PD-(L)1 therapy in a real-world scenario. The objectives of this study were to confirm the safety and efficacy of anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy and to identify pretreatment factors influencing therapy outcomes. In addition, an independent prognostic model for overall survival (OS) was developed and internally validated. RESULTS Median OS was 7.8 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.4-10.4], median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.80 months (95% CI, 2.4-3.4), disease control rate (DCR) was 40% (95% CI, 31-49), and overall response rate (ORR) was 24% (95% CI, 15-31). Presence of peritoneal metastases was associated with poor OS [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.40, 95% CI, 1.08-5.33; P = 0.03]. Use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) was associated with poor OS (HR = 1.83, 95% CI, 1.11-3.02; P = 0.02) and PFS (HR = 1.94, 95% CI, 1.22-3.09; P = 0.005), and lower DCR (OR = 0.38, 95% CI, 0.17-0.89; P = 0.03) and ORR (OR = 0.18, 95% CI, 0.02-1.60; P = 0.002). The three risk category prognostic model developed included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, PPI use, albumin level, presence of liver metastases, and presence of peritoneal metastases variables and was associated with higher risk of death (HR = 3.00, 95% CI, 1.97-4.56; P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS This study confirms anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy as a safe and effective treatment option in daily clinical practice for mUC patients. It also describes the presence of peritoneal metastases as an independent prognostic factor for OS and underlines the association between PPI use and worse therapeutic outcomes. Finally, it proposes a new easy-to-use risk-assessment model for OS prediction.","Ruiz-Bañobre, J; Molina-Díaz, A; Fernández-Calvo, O; Fernández-Núñez, N; Medina-Colmenero, A; Santomé, L; Lázaro-Quintela, M; Mateos-González, M; García-Cid, N; López-López, R; Vázquez, S; Anido-Herranz, U",ESMO open,84,5

Recombination produces RNA populations distinct from full-length gene segments and can influence viral population dynamics, persistence, and host immune responses. Viruses in the Reoviridae family, including rotavirus and mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus), have been reported to package segments containing rearrangements or internal deletions. Rotaviruses with RNA segments containing rearrangements have been isolated from immunocompromised and immunocompetent children and in vitro following serial passage at relatively high multiplicity. Reoviruses that package small, defective RNA segments have established chronic infections in cells and in mice. However, the mechanism and extent of Reoviridae RNA recombination are undefined. Towards filling this gap in knowledge, we determined the titers and RNA segment profiles for reovirus and rotavirus following serial passage in cultured cells. The viruses exhibited occasional titer reductions characteristic of interference. Reovirus strains frequently accumulated segments that retained 5' and 3' terminal sequences and featured large internal deletions, while similarly fragmented segments were rarely detected in rotavirus populations. Using next-generation RNA-sequencing to analyze RNA molecules packaged in purified reovirus particles, we identified distinct recombination sites within individual viral genome segments. Recombination junctions were frequently but not always characterized by short direct sequence repeats upstream and downstream that spanned junction sites. Taken together, these findings suggest that reovirus accumulates defective gene segments featuring internal deletions during passage and undergoes sequence-directed recombination at distinct sites.IMPORTANCE Viruses in the Reoviridae family include important pathogens of humans and other animals and have segmented RNA genomes. Recombination in RNA virus populations can facilitate novel host exploration and increased disease severity. The extent, patterns, and mechanisms of Reoviridae recombination and the functions and effects of recombined RNA products are poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that mammalian orthoreovirus regularly synthesizes RNA recombination products that retain terminal sequences but contain internal deletions, while rotavirus rarely synthesizes such products. Recombination occurs more frequently at specific sites in the mammalian orthoreovirus genome, and short regions of identical sequence are often detected at junction sites. These findings suggest that mammalian orthoreovirus recombination events are directed in part by RNA sequences. An improved understanding of recombined viral RNA synthesis may enhance our capacity to engineer improved vaccines and virotherapies in the future.","Smith, Sydni Caet; Gribble, Jennifer; Diller, Julia R; Wiebe, Michelle A; Thoner, Timothy W; Denison, Mark R; Ogden, Kristen M",Journal of virology,84,8

In this review, we focus on picornaviruses, a family of positive-strand RNA viruses, and discuss the mechanisms by which these viruses hijack the cellular machinery to form and operate membranous replication complexes. Studies aimed at revealing factors required for the establishment of viral replication structures identified several cellular-membrane-remodeling proteins and led to the development of models in which the virus used a preexisting cellular-membrane-shaping pathway ""as is"" for generating its replication organelles. However, as more data accumulate, this view is being increasingly questioned, and it is becoming clearer that viruses may utilize cellular factors in ways that are distinct from the normal functions of these proteins in uninfected cells. In addition, the proteincentric view is being supplemented by important new studies showing a previously unappreciated deep remodeling of lipid homeostasis, including extreme changes to phospholipid biosynthesis and cholesterol trafficking. The data on viral modifications of lipid biosynthetic pathways are still rudimentary, but it appears once again that the viruses may rewire existing pathways to generate novel functions. Despite remarkable progress, our understanding of how a handful of viral proteins can completely overrun the multilayered, complex mechanisms that control the membrane organization of a eukaryotic cell remains very limited.","Belov, George A; Sztul, Elizabeth",Journal of virology,84,33

Women with BD presented even higher levels than those affected by MDD. This study attempted to verify, in line with a dimensional approach, if the possible differences in neurohormonal levels may be directly linked to some syndromal clusters (dimensions) of the mood spectrum disorders indipendently of diagnosis. METHODS Premenstrual concentrations of allopregnanolone, THDOC, progesterone, and cortisol were measured in 3 groups of women: 17 BD and 14 MDD outpatients, and 16 control subjects. Psychiatric evaluation was performed with the SCID-I interview and the SCI-MOODS-SR questionnaire. The correlation between steroid levels and mood disorder syndromal cluster (SCI-MOODS-SR domains and sub-domains) was evaluated by means of analysis of main components with Varimax rotation and Kaiser's normalization (which provided for inclusion of all components with an Eigen value >1). RESULTS Analysis of the main components evidenced the presence of 3 components: 1) mania, 2) depression both with mixed component 3) steroid + manic cognitivity and suicidal ideas. CONCLUSION Levels of allopregnanolone and progesterone do not correlate with the association of the depressive and manic syndromes, but rather with mixed symptomatological aspects, and in particular with cognitive manic and depressive (with suicidal thoughts) dimensions. Further studies should be carried out to confirm these findings.","Hardoy, Maria Carolina; Sardu, Claudia; Dell'osso, Liliana; Carta, Mauro Giovanni",Clinical practice and epidemiology in mental health : CP & EMH,84,1

This study aimed to determine whether placing capnometer distant from the endotracheal tube by connecting direct connect catheter mount (DCCM) is effective in yielding reliable end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) by reducing capnometer malfunctioning caused by water exposure. Methods In 25 healthy adults, a prospective, open label, crossover study was conducted to examine the effect of DCCM in mainstream and microstream capnometers under water exposing conditions. The primary endpoint was the comparison of ETCO2 between proximal DCCM (pDCCM) and distal DCCM (dDCCM). Results For mainstream capnometers, mean ETCO2 was significantly (p < 0.001) higher in dDCCM compared to pDCCM under water exposing conditions (29.5 vs. 19.0 with 5 ml; 33.8 vs. 21.2 with 10 ml; mmHg). Likewise, for microstream capnometers, ETCO2 was greatly higher (p < 0.001) in dDCCM compared to pDCCM (30.5 vs. 13.9 with 5 ml; 29.9 vs.11.4 with 10 mL; mmHg). ETCO2 measured by dDCCM was reliable in microstream settings, whereas it was unreliable in mainstream (correlation coefficient 0.88 vs. 0.27). Conclusions Application of DCCM onto the capnometer setting seems to be effective in reducing capnometer malfunctioning under fluid exposing conditions, which is obvious in microstream capnometer by producing more reliable ETCO2.","Cho, Yongil; Kim, Wonhee; Lim, Tae Ho; Choi, Hyuk Joong; Oh, Jaehoon; Kang, Bossng; Kim, Youjin; Kim, In Young",Emergency medicine international,84,5

METHODS The influences of noni juice on cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, migration and the activity of AKT/nuclear factor- κ B (NF- κ B) signaling pathway in A549 human lung cancer cells were detected by MTT, cell counting kit-8, colony formation, Annexin V/PI double labeling, transwell, scratch test and immunoblotting assay, respectively. A549 cells were inoculated into the right axilla of nude mice, followed by noni juice treatment. The body weight of the nude mice was weighed, and the tumor volume and weight were measured. Cell proliferation and expression of apoptosis-related proteins were measured by immunohistochemistry, and the activity of NF- κ B signaling pathway was measured by immunoblotting. RESULTS The in vitro studies showed that noni juice inhibited the A549 cells proliferation, migration and invasion. Noni juice also promoted cells apoptosis in A549 cells. Immunoblotting assay showed that the phosphorylation level of AKT, p50, and STAT3 proteins was inhibited to different extents after noni juice treatment. The in vivo studies showed that noni juice effectively suppressed tumor formation of A549 cells in nude mice. Noni juice treatment inhibited the expression of Ki67, PCNA, and Bcl-2 protein in the tumor; while promoted the expression of caspase-3 protein. Additionally, we also found that noni juice treatment could restrain the activity of AKT/NF- κ B signaling pathway in the tumor tissue.

We investigated how a 40S subunit was recruited by the cricket paralysis virus intergenic region (CrPV IGR) IRES to form a stable 40S-IRES complex. Kinetic binding studies revealed that formation of the complex between the CrPV IGR and the 40S subunit consisted of two-steps: an initial fast binding step of the IRES to the 40S ribosomal subunit, followed by a slow unimolecular reaction consistent with a conformational change that stabilized the complex. We further showed that the ribosomal protein S25 (eS25), which is required by functionally and structurally diverse IRESs, impacts both steps of the complex formation. Mutations in eS25 that reduced CrPV IGR IRES activity either decreased 40S-IRES complex formation, or increased the rate of the conformational change that was required to form a stable 40S-IRES complex. Our data are consistent with a model in which eS25 facilitates initial binding of the CrPV IGR IRES to the 40S while ensuring that the conformational change stabilizing the 40S-IRES complex does not occur prematurely.","Walters, Beth; Axhemi, Armend; Jankowsky, Eckhard; Thompson, Sunnie R",Nucleic acids research,84,1

In recent years, there has been effort to characterize the nature of paediatric bone and joint infection for New Zealand due to rising incidence of osteomyelitis and staphylococcal sepsis [1, 2]. We have sought to identify trends in presentation, diagnosis and management of paediatric septic arthritis, with added focus on ethnicity and access to healthcare. METHODS A ten year retrospective review of all cases < 16 years with presumed septic arthritis presenting to a tertiary referral centre between 2008 and 2018 was performed. RESULTS A total of 103 cases met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 5.9 years (SD +/- 4.17) with a male predominance (64%). Traditional laboratory culture method isolated an organism in 66% of cases: Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen identified (61%). Incidence varied greatly by ethnicity 1:16,000 for NZ European children; 1:8760 for Pacifica and 1:4300 for Māori. Mean distance travelled by patients to reach the nearest emergency department was 38.3 km, ranging from 2 to 188 km. Assessment using NZ deprivation scores showed the Māori paediatric population were likely to reside in areas of worse socioeconomic deprivation (p = 0.0005). The majority (66%) of cases were treated surgically with a low recurrence rate (2.9%). Delayed presentation was associated with worse outcomes and more likely in patients residing > 20 km away from the nearest emergency department. CONCLUSION The incidence of paediatric septic arthritis in New Zealand is concerningly high within Māori and Pacific populations. Future health interventions should consider environmental, socioeconomic, and microbiological trends in the burden of disease.","Hunter, Sarah; Baker, Joseph F",International orthopaedics,84,28

For this study, 19 newborn calves were divided into two groups. The control group consisted of 10 animals; and the treated group consisted of nine animals that received copper edetate (Cu-ed) and zinc edetate (Zn-ed) subcutaneously at the first day of life at doses of 0.3 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg respectively. Blood and faecal samples were collected for laboratory analyses (seric biochemistry, proteinogram, antioxidant enzymes and parasitological examination) on days 10, 20 and 30 after birth. On day 10, treated animals showed increased levels of total proteins, as well as increased globulin levels compared to the control group, a finding probably related to the increase in ceruloplasmin and IgG heavy chain. Thirty days after mineral metaphylactic administration, IgG light chain and acid glycoprotein levels significantly increased in treated animals (p < .05). There were no significant differences between groups regarding the biochemical analyses (triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose and urea). On the other hand, the superoxide dismutase and catalase activities increased on day 10 after treatment. In the control group, eight animals showed severe diarrhoea and one died 8 days after birth. Two animals from this group showed mild diarrhoea. Only three treated animals had severe diarrhoea, and six showed signs of mild diarrhoea. All animals that showed severe diarrhoea (control = 8; treated = 3) had hyperthermia (over 39.5°C), and therefore, antibiotic therapy was administered (sulfadiazine and trimethoprim) for five consecutive days. In summary, Zn-ed and Cu-ed decreased the frequency and intensity of diarrhoea, modulated superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzymes and also heightened the immune responsiveness of newborn calves, suggesting a new approach to improve cattle performance and minimize the occurrence of diarrhoea.","Tomasi, T; Volpato, A; Pereira, W A B; Debastiani, L H; Bottari, N B; Morsch, V M; Schetinger, M R C; Leal, M L R; Machado, G; Da Silva, A S",Journal of animal physiology and animal nutrition,84,16

In many countries, use of vaccines is restricted due to limitations of subunit vaccines with regard to efficacy and onset of protection as well as failure of live vaccines to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA principle). Chimeric pestiviruses based on CSF virus (CSFV) and the related bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) have been licensed as live marker vaccines in Europe and Asia, but cross-reactive antibodies can cause problems in DIVA application due to close antigenic relationship. To develop marker vaccine candidates with improved DIVA properties, three chimeric viruses were generated by replacing Erns of CSFV Alfort-Tübingen with homologue proteins of only distantly related pestiviruses. The chimeric viruses ""Ra"", ""Pro"", and ""RaPro"" contained Erns sequences of Norway rat and Pronghorn pestiviruses or a combination of both, respectively. In porcine cells, the ""Pro"" chimera replicated to high titers, while replication of the ""Ra"" chimera was limited. The ""RaPro"" chimera showed an intermediate phenotype. All vaccine candidates were attenuated in a vaccination/ challenge trial in pigs, but to different extents. Inoculation induced moderate to high levels of neutralizing antibodies that protected against infection with a genetically heterologous, highly virulent CSFV. Importantly, serum samples of vaccinated animals did not show any cross-reactivity in a CSFV Erns antibody ELISA. In conclusion, the Erns antigen from distantly related pestiviruses can provide a robust serological negative marker for a new generation of improved CSFV marker vaccines based on the chimeric pestivirus concept.","Postel, Alexander; Becher, Paul",Emerging microbes & infections,84,4

The primary aim of this preliminary systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the effect of CRT for AN relative to control treatments in randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) on neuropsychological inefficiencies at end-of-treatment. Secondary aims were to assess the effect of CRT for AN on dropout, eating-disorder-related, and other psychological outcomes at end-of-treatment. Systematic review and meta-analytic procedures were conducted in accordance with PRISMA Guidelines. RCTs evaluating CRT for AN compared to a control treatment were identified via ProQuest, PsycINFO, PubMed, and SCOPUS. Seven RCTs and one quasi-RCT of CRT for AN were included. RCT quality ratings ranged from fair (n = 3) to good (n = 4). Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted using Hedge's g. Study heterogeneity was assessed using I2 and publication bias was assessed with Begg's adjusted-rank correlation and the trim-and-fill method. CRT was not associated with improvement in central coherence compared to control treatments at end-of-treatment (g = 0.25, 95% CI = -0.35, 0.85, k = 3). Set-shifting outcomes were mixed due to heterogeneity of set-shifting measures across studies. CRT may prevent dropout; yet, more studies are needed to draw conclusions. CRT did not confer advantage over control treatments for eating-disorder-related and other psychological outcomes at end-of-treatment.

We performed a retrospective study to characterize pial arterial supply to dural arteriovenous fistulas and the implications for treatment. METHODS Consecutive patients evaluated over a 12-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Angiograms were reviewed to characterize dAVF angioarchitecture and the presence of pial artery supply. Pial artery supply was categorized as dilated pre-existing dural branches and pure pial supply. We then studied the association between pial artery supply and clinical, angiographic, and treatment features. RESULTS A total of 201 patients were included of which 27 (13.4%) had pial artery supply. Of these, 11 had supply from dilated pre-existing dural branches, nine had pure pial supply,and seven had both. There was a higher rate of dAVF rupture in the pial supply group (30.8% vs 9.8%, P=0.003) and these fistulas had a higher rate of Borden 2 and 3 (88.9% vs 38.4%, P<0.0001). Fistulas with pial artery supply had similar rates of endovascular and gamma knife treatment, but were more likely to undergo surgery than those without pial supply (25.9% vs 10.4%, P=0.03). Major complication rates were similar between groups (0% vs 1.1%, P=0.55). CONCLUSIONS More than 10% of dAVFs also have pial supply but this is not a contraindication to embolization.

PPSTs are routinely resected by a transcervical approach using blind finger dissection. Large PPSTs or those located high at the skull base, often require transmandibular or infratemporal fossa approaches, associated with considerable morbidity. Objective Here, we describe an approach for PPST removal that comprises transcervical endoscopic, with or without transoral robotic technique. Materials and Methods We retrospectively studied the demographic, clinical, surgical, and outcome data of 11 consecutive patients who underwent PPST excision between June 2013 and July 2017 at our center. Patients either underwent a transcervical endoscopic procedure ( n = 4), a transoral robotic procedure ( n = 2) or a combination of the two procedures ( n = 5). Results Complete tumor excision was achieved in all cases, with no intra-, peri-, or postoperative complications. Final histopathologic findings demonstrated pleomorphic adenoma for seven patients, cavernous hemangioma for one patient, and malignant tumors for three patients. The average tumor size was 44.22 ± 31.9 cm 3 (range: 7.5-111 cm 3 ). At follow-up (range: 3-42 months), there was no evidence of recurrence. Conclusions The approach described provides improved visualization and safe vascular control with minimum tumor stress, preventing the need for blind finger dissection, and allowing complete tumor removal while minimizing tumor spillage, nerve injury, and blood loss, maintaining excellent cosmetic and functional results. This approach could be utilized for the removal of large benign PPST, or small PPST located high.","Duek, Irit; Sviri, Gill E; Billan, Salem; Gil, Ziv","Journal of neurological surgery.

At a community hospital, we compared outcomes in patients aged ≥80 and patients in the age range 55-79 years receiving IAT following ischemic stroke. METHODS Data were retrospectively abstracted for ischemic stroke patients ≥55 years treated with IAT at an urban comprehensive stroke center between 2010 and 2013. Baseline demographics, incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), in-hospital mortality, discharge modified Rankin scale (mRS) score (favorable ≤2) and improvement in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score (NIHSS; decreased score at discharge) were compared between patients in the age range 55-79 and patients ≥80 years. Data were analyzed using univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS IAT was performed in 239 patients with ischemic stroke; 63 (26.4%) were ≥80 years. When compared to patients aged 55-79, the elderly patients were more often female and non-smokers, with a history of atrial fibrillation. No differences were observed in those ≥80 years compared to patients in the age range 55-79 years for sICH (10 vs. 5%, p = 0.23), mortality (24 vs. 18%, p = 0.28), favorable discharge mRS score (13 vs. 19%, p = 0.27), or improvement in NIHSS (83 vs. 92%, p = 0.10). The nonsignificant association of age with the outcomes persisted after adjusting for covariates and when analyzing the subset of patients who received IAT only.

Near-infrared spectroscopy is commonly used to assess cerebral tissue oxygenation, especially during cardiac surgery. Recent studies have suggested an association between cerebral desaturation and postoperative cognitive dysfunction. We therefore studied cerebral oxygen desaturation, defined as area under the cerebral oxygenation curve < 40% of > 10 min.%, with respect to cognitive performance at 4 days (early) and 3 months (late) postoperatively, compared with baseline, using a computerised cognitive test battery. We included 60 patients, of mean (SD) age 62.8 (9.4) years, scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting, who were randomly allocated to surgery with or without cardiopulmonary bypass. Cerebral desaturation occurred in only three patients and there was no difference in cerebral oxygenation between the two groups at any time. Among patients who received cardiopulmonary bypass, 18 (62%) had early cognitive decline, compared with 16 (53%) in the group without cardiopulmonary bypass (p = 0.50). Three months after surgery, 11 patients (39%) in the cardiopulmonary bypass group displayed cognitive dysfunction, compared with four (14%) in the non-cardiopulmonary bypass group (p = 0.03).

Infrared spectroscopy of molecules trapped in helium nanodroplets is a promising methodology for the measurement of thermochemical parameters. When molecules are captured in a helium nanodroplet, the rate of cooling to an equilibrium temperature of ca. 0.4 K is generally faster than the rate of isomerization, resulting in ""shock-freezing"" that kinetically traps molecules in local conformational minima. This unique property enables the study of temperature-dependent conformational equilibria via infrared spectroscopy at 0.4 K, thereby avoiding the deleterious effects of spectral broadening at higher temperatures. Herein, we demonstrate the first application of this approach to ionic species by coupling electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with helium nanodroplet infrared action spectroscopy to probe the structure and thermochemistry of deprotonated DNA dinucleotides. Dinucleotide anions were generated by ESI, confined in an ion trap at temperatures between 90 and 350 K, and entrained in traversing helium nanodroplets. The infrared action spectra of the entrained ions show a strong dependence on pre-pickup ion temperature, consistent with the preservation of conformer population upon cooling to 0.4 K. Non-negative matrix factorization was utilized to identify component conformer infrared spectra and determine temperature-dependent conformer populations. Relative enthalpies and entropies of conformers were subsequently obtained from a van't Hoff analysis. IR spectra and conformer thermochemistry are compared to results from ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) and electronic structure methods. The implementation of ESI-MS as a source of dopant molecules expands the diversity of molecules accessible for thermochemical measurements, enabling the study of larger, non-volatile species.","Thomas, Daniel A; Chang, Rayoon; Mucha, Eike; Lettow, Maike; Greis, Kim; Gewinner, Sandy; Schöllkopf, Wieland; Meijer, Gerard; von Helden, Gert",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,84,17

Evidence suggests that sonification could be a viable strategy to maximize learning and rehabilitation. Recent studies investigated sonification of action observation, reporting beneficial effects, especially in Parkinson's disease. However, research on simulation training-a training regime based on action observation and motor imagery, in which actions are internally simulated, without physical execution-suggest that action observation alone is suboptimal, compared to the combined use of action observation and motor imagery. In this study, we explored the effects of sonified action observation and motor imagery on corticospinal excitability, as well as to evaluate the extent of practice-dependent plasticity induced by this training. Nineteen participants were recruited to complete a practice session based on combined and congruent action observation and motor imagery (AOMI) and physical imitation of the same action. Prior to the beginning, participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups, one group (nine participants) completed the practice block with sonified AOMI, while the other group (ten participants) completed the practice without extrinsic auditory information and served as control group. To investigate practice-induced plasticity, participants completed two auditory paired associative stimulation (aPAS) protocols, one completed after the practice block, and another one completed alone, without additional interventions, at least 7 days before the practice. After the practice block, both groups significantly increased their corticospinal excitability, but sonification did not exert additional benefits, compared to non-sonified conditions. In addition, aPAS significantly increased corticospinal excitability when completed alone, but when it was primed by a practice block, no modulatory effects on corticospinal excitability were found. It is possible that sonification of combined action observation and motor imagery may not be a useful strategy to improve corticospinal, but further studies are needed to explore its relationship with performance improvements. We also confirm the neuromodulatory effect of aPAS, but its interaction with audiomotor practice remain unclear.","Castro, Fabio; Osman, Ladan; Di Pino, Giovanni; Vuckovic, Aleksandra; Nowicky, Alexander; Bishop, Daniel",Experimental brain research,84,16

These enzymes inactivate or activate other soluble or membrane-expressed mediator molecules, which enables them to control developmental processes, tissue remodelling, inflammatory responses and proliferative signalling pathways. The dysregulation of MMPs and ADAMs has long been recognized in acute kidney injury and in chronic kidney disease, and genetic targeting of selected MMPs and ADAMs in different mouse models of kidney disease showed that they can have detrimental and protective roles. In particular, MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, ADAM10 and ADAM17 have been shown to have a mainly profibrotic effect and might therefore represent therapeutic targets. Each of these proteases has been associated with a different profibrotic pathway that involves tissue remodelling, Wnt-β-catenin signalling, stem cell factor-c-kit signalling, IL-6 trans-signalling or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling. Broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitors have been used to treat fibrotic kidney diseases experimentally but more targeted approaches have since been developed, including inhibitory antibodies, to avoid the toxic side effects initially observed with broad-spectrum inhibitors.

Using air purifiers with a HEPA filter H14, a 4.6-6.1 Log reduction of test viruses can be achieved if bacteriophages are directly aerosolised into the air purifier, which corresponds to a reduction of 99.9974-99.9999%. Due to the complexity and individuality of air flow, an experimental approach was used in which all outside influences were minimised. The experimental setup was practical and chosen to project a scenario of direct transmission by an emitting source to a recipient. The experiments were performed with and without the air purifier at a distance of 0.75 m and 1.5 m each. Using the air purifier at a setting of 1000 m3/h, the concentration of the phiX174 phages in the air could be reduced by 2.86 Log (mean value). Nevertheless, the experiments without the air purifier showed a similar reduction rate of 2.61 Log (mean value) after 35 min. The concentration of phiX174 phages in the air could be additionally reduced up to 1 log step (maximum value) by the use of the air purifier in comparison to the experiments without.

It introduces health impact assessment methods, used to predict the benefits that can be expected from implementation of interventions to reduce emissions of pollutants. It also explains the estimation of annual mortality burdens attributable to current levels of pollution. Burden estimates are intended to meet the need to communicate the size of the effect of air pollution on public health to policy makers and others. The implications, for the interpretation of the estimates, of the assumptions and approximations underlying the methods are discussed. The paper starts with quantification based on results obtained from studies of the association of mortality risk with long-term average concentrations of particulate air pollution. It then tackles the additional methodological considerations that need to be addressed when also considering the mortality effects of other pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Finally, approaches that could be used to integrate morbidity and mortality endpoints in the same assessment are touched upon.

METHODS Participants of a 1-year open-label phase 1b study of IT delivered rituximab to patients with PMS were offered extended treatment with follow-up for an additional 2 years. During the extension phase, treatment with 25 mg rituximab was administered every 6 months via a subcutaneous Ommaya reservoir connected to the right frontal horn with a ventricular catheter. RESULTS Mild to moderate vertigo and nausea occurred in 4 out of 14 participants as temporary adverse events associated with IT rituximab infusion. During the entire 3-year period, two cases of low-virulent bacterial meningitis occurred, which were successfully treated. Walking speed deteriorated significantly during the study. CONCLUSIONS IT administration of rituximab via a ventricular catheter was well tolerated. Considering the meningitis cases, the risk of infection was not negligible. The continued loss of walking speed indicates that IT rituximab was not able to stop disease progression. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides class IV evidence that intraventricularly administered rituximab in progressive MS is associated with a risk for bacterial meningitis and does not halt disease progression.

However, workers, especially in the construction industry, have shown some aversion towards the use of WSDs due to their ability to capture specific information that may be considered personal and private. However, this revered information may provide some critical insight needed by management to plan and optimize worksite safety and support technology adoption in decision making. Therefore, there is a need to develop personalized WSD systems that are mutually beneficial to workers and management to ensure successful WSD integration. The present study aims to contribute to knowledge and practice by filling this critical gap using insight from 330 construction workers with experience using WSDs. The results from this study indicate that all 11 WSD functions identified through this study play a vital role in improving worker safety and health and that approximately two out of three workers are open to sharing the physiological and environmental information captured using these WSDs with their management. However, functions for detecting workers' proximity to workplace hazards, specifically energized electrical materials, toxic gas, and fire/smoke, were the most critical functions that had mutual value to workers and management. Finally, the present study proposed and evaluated a phased personalized WSD system that should encourage successful WSD integration.","Nnaji, Chukwuma; Awolusi, Ibukun; Park, Jee Woong; Albert, Alex",Sensors,84,31

METHODS A cross-sectional study was designed. All women aged up to 24 years, who delivered between April 25, 2020 and June 24, 2020 at Women's Hospital, University of Campinas, Brazil were considered. The ENG-implant or other contraceptive methods were offered prior to hospital discharge. The participants were split into two groups: 1) those who chose the ENG-implant and 2) those that refused the implant. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS 151 women were included, with 76.2% selecting the implant. The average age was 19.5 years; 73.2% of pregnancies were unplanned, 32.5% already had a previous pregnancy, 74% were single, and 75.5% were not in full time education. Further, 70.5% had previously used contraceptives, with 89.1% unsatisfied that opted for the ENG-implant (P=0.07). CONCLUSION Offering the ENG-implant to youths during the immediate postnatal period is evidence-based care, and contraceptive provision is an essential health promotion tool, even during a pandemic.

METHOD Subjects in this analysis were adult outpatients (18-65 years) enrolled from 2 acute, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials comparing adjunctive L-methylfolate and placebo for DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD) with an inadequate response to monotherapy selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Subjects who completed the acute trial were offered to enroll in a 12-month, open-label treatment phase with L-methylfolate and continued SSRI treatment, with scheduled visits for efficacy, safety, and tolerability every 12 weeks. Subjects were enrolled between September 2006 and February 2010. Efficacy outcomes included predefined criteria for response, remission, recovery, relapse, and recurrence. Subjects treated with adjunctive L-methylfolate 15 mg were included in the efficacy analysis. RESULTS Of 68 subjects who met criteria for the 12-month open-label phase, 38% (n = 26) achieved full recovery, and none experienced a recurrence of MDD. For subjects entering the open-label phase in remission (n = 11), 91% (n = 10) achieved full recovery with L-methylfolate 15 mg, and none experienced a relapse or recurrence. Among 57 subjects who entered the open-label phase as nonremitted, 61% (n = 35) achieved remission. Of subjects who entered the open-label phase with a response without remission (n = 4), 50% (n = 2) had full recovery, and of subjects entering the open-label phase with no response (n = 53), 26% (n = 14) met recovery criteria. CONCLUSIONS Adjunctive L-methylfolate 15 mg/d may be an early option in patients who fail to adequately respond to antidepressant monotherapy, with preliminary evidence demonstrating sustained remission and sustained recovery.

The gasless abdominal wall-lifting method for laparoscopic splenectomy was introduced as an alternative. This retrospective study was undertaken to compare results using the two techniques. METHODS Between 1995 and 2010, 54 patients underwent laparoscopic splenectomy at a single institution; 30 underwent the procedure using the gasless technique and 24 using pneumoperitoneum. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding age, sex or BMI, but more patients underwent concurrent operations in the pneumoperitoneum group. The abdominal wall-lift system with subcutaneous K-wires was used for the gasless method. RESULTS Intraoperative blood loss was similar in the two groups (193.0 ± 196.7 mL gasless, 217.3 ± 296.6 mL pneumoperitoneum; P > 0.05), but operative time (182.1 ± 92.1 min, 135.1 ± 46.1 min; P < 0.05), and resected spleen weight (306.1 ± 297.7 g, 138 ± 81.0 g; P < 0.05) were significantly different. In the gasless group, additional procedures included conversion (n = 1), mini-laparotomy (n = 2), and CO(2) insufflation (n = 2). Excluding the concurrent living-related kidney donor patients, hospital stay was similar (6.9 ± 2.5 days, 6.3 ± 2.0 days, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Although gasless laparoscopic splenectomy is feasible, there are disadvantages, particularly the restricted operative working space in some patients. These results suggest that either technique may be used on an individual basis in patients undergoing laparoscopic splenectomy.","Hyodo, M; Sata, N; Koizumi, M; Sakuma, Y; Kurihara, K; Lefor, A T; Ohki, J; Nagai, H; Yasuda, Y",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,84,16

This study evaluated the wait time to diagnose non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the cost of diagnosis and treatment based on the stage at diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS Adult patients diagnosed with NSCLC between January 2007 and September 2011 were identified from a proprietary oncology registry and linked to health insurance claims from a large US health insurance company. Continuous enrollment in the health plan was required for at least 12 months prediagnosis (baseline) and at least 3 months postdiagnosis (follow-up). Use of diagnostic tests and time to diagnosis were examined. The rates of health care utilization and per-patient per-month (PPPM) health care costs were calculated. RESULTS A total of 1,210 patients with NSCLC were included in the analysis. Most patients (93.6%) had evidence of diagnostic tests beginning 5 to 6 months prior to diagnosis, and most were diagnosed at an advanced stage (23% Stage IIIb and 46% Stage IV). The PPPM total health care costs in USD pre- and postdiagnosis were $2,407±$3,364 (mean±standard deviation) and $16,577±$33,550, respectively. PPPM total health care costs and utilization after lung cancer diagnosis were significantly higher among patients diagnosed at Stage IV disease and lowest among patients diagnosed at Stage I disease ($7,239 Stage I, $9,484 Stage II, $11,193 Stage IIIa, $17,415 Stage IIIb, and $21,441 Stage IV). CONCLUSION This study showed that most patients experienced long periods of delay between their first diagnostic test for lung cancer and a definitive diagnosis, and the majority were diagnosed at advanced stages of disease. Costs associated with the management of lung cancer increased substantially with higher stages at diagnosis. Procedures that diagnose lung cancer at earlier stages may allow for less resource use and costs among patients with lung cancer.","Gildea, Thomas R; DaCosta Byfield, Stacey; Hogarth, D Kyle; Wilson, David S; Quinn, Curtis C",ClinicoEconomics and outcomes research : CEOR,84,1

Smoke generated by the interaction between lasers or electrocautery devices with biological tissue contains several toxic and carcinogenic substances, but only a few studies so far have provided quantitative data necessary for risk assessment. METHODS With laser and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, we investigated the chemical composition of smoke produced with a vessel-sealing device in an anoxic environment during laparoscopic surgery. RESULTS Harmless concentrations of methane (<34 ppm), ethane (<2 ppm), and ethylene (<10 ppm) were detected. Traces of carbon monoxide (<3.2 ppm) and of the anesthetic sevoflurane (<450 ppm) were also found. CONCLUSIONS. Gas leaking or gas being released from the pneumoperitoneum could therefore increase pollution by waste anesthetic gas in the operating room. Most toxic compounds found in earlier studies remained undetected. Adverse health effects for operating room personnel due to some of those substances (e.g., toluene, styrene, xylene) can be excluded, assuming no significant losses or changes in the chemical composition of the samples occurred between our sampling and measurements.","Gianella, Michele; Hahnloser, Dieter; Rey, Julien M; Sigrist, Markus W",Surgical innovation,84,16

The aim of the current study was to explore the intracellular and potent systemic effects of TcdB on human colon epithelial cells utilizing Gene Expression Omnibus and bioinformatic methods. METHODS Two datasets (GSE63880 and GSE29008) were collected to extract data components of mRNA of TcdB-treated human colon epithelial cells; ""limma"" package of ""R"" software was used to screen the differential genes, and ""pheatmap"" package was applied to construct heat maps for the differential genes; Metascape website was utilized for protein-protein interaction network and Molecular Complex Detection analysis, and Genome Ontology (GO) was used to analyze the selected differential genes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were performed to validate the expression of hub genes. RESULTS GO terms involved in DNA replication and cell cycle were identified significantly enriched in TcdB-treated human colon epithelial cells. Moreover, the decreased expression of DNA replication-related genes, MCM complex, and CDC45 in C. difficile (TcdA-/TcdB+)-infected Caco-2 cells were validated via qRT-PCR and Western blot assays. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the integrated analysis of different gene expression datasets allowed us to identify a set of genes and GO terms underlying the mechanisms of CDI induced by TcdB.

A prospective, randomized clinical trial.",18.341892,10.4757805,2014,"BACKGROUND Mefloquine is one of four antimalarial agents commonly recommended for preventing malaria in travellers to malaria-endemic areas. Despite its high efficacy, there is controversy about its psychological side effects. OBJECTIVES To summarize the efficacy and safety of mefloquine used as prophylaxis for malaria in travellers. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published on the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase (OVID); TOXLINE (https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/toxline.htm); and LILACS. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home) for trials in progress, using 'mefloquine', 'Lariam', and 'malaria' as search terms. The search date was 22 June 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials (for efficacy and safety) and non-randomized cohort studies (for safety). We compared prophylactic mefloquine with placebo, no treatment, or an alternative recommended antimalarial agent. Our study populations included all adults and children, including pregnant women. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of trials, extracted and analysed data. We compared dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prespecified adverse outcomes are included in 'Summary of findings' tables, with the best available estimate of the absolute frequency of each outcome in short-term international travellers. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS We included 20 RCTs (11,470 participants); 35 cohort studies (198,493 participants); and four large retrospective analyses of health records (800,652 participants). Nine RCTs explicitly excluded participants with a psychiatric history, and 25 cohort studies stated that the choice of antimalarial agent was based on medical history and personal preference. Most RCTs and cohort studies collected data on self-reported or clinician-assessed symptoms, rather than formal medical diagnoses. Mefloquine efficacyOf 12 trials comparing mefloquine and placebo, none were performed in short-term international travellers, and most populations had a degree of immunity to malaria. The percentage of people developing a malaria episode in the control arm varied from 1% to 82% (median 22%) and 0% to 13% in the mefloquine group (median 1%).In four RCTs that directly compared mefloquine, atovaquone-proguanil and doxycycline in non-immune, short-term international travellers, only one clinical case of malaria occurred (4 trials, 1822 participants). Mefloquine safety versus atovaquone-proguanil Participants receiving mefloquine were more likely to discontinue their medication due to adverse effects than atovaquone-proguanil users (RR 2.86, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.31; 3 RCTs, 1438 participants; high-certainty evidence). There were few serious adverse effects reported with mefloquine (15/2651 travellers) and none with atovaquone-proguanil (940 travellers).One RCT and six cohort studies reported on our prespecified adverse effects. In the RCT with short-term travellers, mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.04, moderate-certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.42, 95% CI 2.56 to 7.64, moderate-certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 6.12, 95% CI 1.82 to 20.66, moderate-certainty evidence), and depressed mood during travel (RR 5.78, 95% CI 1.71 to 19.61, moderate-certainty evidence). The cohort studies in longer-term travellers were consistent with this finding but most had larger effect sizes. Mefloquine users were also more likely to report nausea (high-certainty evidence) and dizziness (high-certainty evidence).Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect sizes for mefloquine versus atovaquone-proguanil are 6% versus 2% for discontinuation of the drug, 13% versus 3% for insomnia, 14% versus 7% for abnormal dreams, 6% versus 1% for anxiety, and 6% versus 1% for depressed mood. Mefloquine safety versus doxycyclineNo difference was found in numbers of serious adverse effects with mefloquine and doxycycline (low-certainty evidence) or numbers of discontinuations due to adverse effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.87; 4 RCTs, 763 participants; low-certainty evidence).Six cohort studies in longer-term occupational travellers reported our prespecified adverse effects; one RCT in military personnel and one cohort study in short-term travellers reported adverse events. Mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 10.49, 95% CI 3.79 to 29.10; 4 cohort studies, 2588 participants, very low-certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.14, 95% CI 1.19 to 14.44; 4 cohort studies, 3212 participants, very low-certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 18.04, 95% CI 9.32 to 34.93; 3 cohort studies, 2559 participants, very low-certainty evidence), and depressed mood (RR 11.43, 95% CI 5.21 to 25.07; 2 cohort studies, 2445 participants, very low-certainty evidence). The findings of the single cohort study reporting adverse events in short-term international travellers were consistent with this finding but the single RCT in military personnel did not demonstrate a difference between groups in frequencies of abnormal dreams or insomnia.Mefloquine users were less likely to report dyspepsia (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.74; 5 cohort studies, 5104 participants, low certainty-evidence), photosensitivity (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.11; 2 cohort studies, 1875 participants, very low-certainty evidence), vomiting (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.27; 4 cohort studies, 5071 participants, very low-certainty evidence), and vaginal thrush (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.16; 1 cohort study, 1761 participants, very low-certainty evidence).Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect for mefloquine versus doxycyline were: 2% versus 2% for discontinuation, 12% versus 3% for insomnia, 31% versus 3% for abnormal dreams, 18% versus 1% for anxiety, 11% versus 1% for depressed mood, 4% versus 14% for dyspepsia, 2% versus 19% for photosensitivity, 1% versus 5% for vomiting, and 2% versus 16% for vaginal thrush.Additional analyses, including comparisons of mefloquine with chloroquine, added no new information. Subgroup analysis by study design, duration of travel, and military versus non-military participants, provided no conclusive findings. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The absolute risk of malaria during short-term travel appears low with all three established antimalarial agents (mefloquine, doxycycline, and atovaquone-proguanil).The choice of antimalarial agent depends on how individual travellers assess the importance of specific adverse effects, pill burden, and cost. Some travellers will prefer mefloquine for its once-weekly regimen, but this should be balanced against the increased frequency of abnormal dreams, anxiety, insomnia, and depressed mood.","Tickell-Painter, Maya; Maayan, Nicola; Saunders, Rachel; Pace, Cheryl; Sinclair, David",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,84,5

Forthcoming large international events will expose female athletes to hot environments, and studies evaluating aerobic exercise performance in such environments across the menstrual cycle are sparse, with mixed findings. We have identified that autonomic heat loss responses at rest and during fixed-intensity exercise in well-trained women are not affected by menstrual cycle phase, but differ between dry and humid heat. Furthermore, exercise performance is not different across the menstrual cycle, yet is lower in humid heat, in conjunction with reduced evaporative cooling. Menstrual cycle phase does not appear to affect exercise performance in the heat in well-trained women, but humidity impairs performance, probably due to reduced evaporative power. ABSTRACT We studied thermoregulatory responses of ten well-trained [V̇O2 max , 57 (7) ml min-1 kg-1 ] eumenorrheic women exercising in dry and humid heat, across their menstrual cycle. They completed four trials, each of resting and cycling at fixed intensities (125 and 150 W), to assess autonomic regulation, then self-paced intensity (30 min work trial), to assess behavioural regulation. Trials were in early-follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases in dry (DRY) and humid (HUM) heat matched for wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT, 27°C). During rest and fixed-intensity exercise, rectal temperature was ∼0.2°C higher in ML than EF (P < 0.01) independent of environment (P = 0.66). Mean skin temperature did not differ between menstrual phases (P ≥ 0.13) but was higher in DRY than HUM (P < 0.01). Local sweat rate and/or forearm blood flow differed as a function of menstrual phase and environment (interaction: P ≤ 0.01). Exercise performance did not differ between phases [EF: 257 (37), ML: 255 (43) kJ, P = 0.62], but was 7 (9)% higher in DRY than HUM [263 (39), 248 (40) kJ; P < 0.01] in conjunction with equivalent autonomic regulation and thermal strain but higher evaporative cooling [16 (6) W m2 ; P < 0.01]. In well-trained women exercising in the heat: (1) menstrual phase did not affect performance, (2) humidity impaired performance due to reduced evaporative cooling despite matched WBGT and (3) behavioural responses nullified thermodynamic and autonomic differences associated with menstrual phase and dry vs. humid heat.","Lei, Tze-Huan; Stannard, Stephen R; Perry, Blake G; Schlader, Zachary J; Cotter, James D; Mündel, Toby",The Journal of physiology,84,30

Findings from previous theoretical studies often suggest that pathogens will evolve to be specialists in specific host environments. However, several of these studies make unrealistic assumptions regarding demographic stochasticity and the ability of pathogens to select their hosts. Here, an individual-based model was used to predict how population size, virulence and pathogen mutation rate affected the evolution niche specialism in pathogens. Pathogen specialism evolved regardless of virulence or populations size; thus, the findings of this study are somewhat consistent with those of previous work. However, because specialist pathogens had only a weak selective advantage over generalist pathogens, high mutation rates caused random trait variation to accumulate, preventing the evolution of specialism. Mutation rate varies greatly across different species and strains of pathogen. By showing that high mutation rates may prevent pathogen specialism evolving, this study highlights an intrinsic pathogen trait that may influence the evolution of pathogen niche width.","Fisher, Adam M",Journal of evolutionary biology,84,26

Time, path length and smoothness are often used parameters, but are not very informative on the quality of the performance. This study aims to validate a newly developed assessment method for laparoscopic suturing on the ProMIS augmented reality simulator, and compares it with scores of objective observers. METHODS Twenty-four participants practised their suturing skills on the augmented reality suturing module: experienced participants (n = 10), >50 clinical laparoscopic suturing experience; and novice participants (n = 14), without laparoscopic experience. The performances were recorded and assessed by two unrelated observers and compared with the assessment scores. The assessment score was a calculation of time spent in the correct area and quality (strength) of the knot. To test the accuracy of the individual assessment parameters, we compared these with each other. RESULTS The experienced participants had significantly higher performance scores than the novice participants in the beginner-level mode (mean 95.73 vs. 60.89, standard deviation 2.63 vs. 17.09, p < 0.001, independent t-test). The performance scores of the assessment method (n = 43) correlated significantly with the scorings of the objective observers (Spearman's rho 0.672; p < 0.001). The parameter time spent in correct area had a calculated significant correlation with the strength of the knot (n = 229, Spearman's rho 0.257, p < 0.001), but this was clinically irrelevant. CONCLUSION This assessment method is a valid tool for objectively assessing laparoscopic suturing skills. Although assessment parameters can correlate, to provide informative feedback it is important to combine meaningful measurements in the assessment of suturing skills.","Botden, Sanne M B I; de Hingh, I H J T; Jakimowicz, J J",Surgical endoscopy,84,15

Beyond motor execution impairments, they exhibit motor planning deficits contributing to their difficulties. The objective of this review is to synthesize the behavioral evidence of motor planning deficits during an upper limb motor task in children, adolescents and young adults with cerebral palsy aged between 3 and 21 years. METHODS The inclusion criteria were: (1) including individuals with cerebral palsy from 3 to 21 years old; (2) assessing upper limb motor planning. Six databases were screened. The quality assessment of the studies was performed. RESULTS Forty-six studies and 686 participants were included. Five articles have been identified as very high quality, 12 as high, 20 as moderate, six as low, three as very low. Force planning studies reported a deficit for the more affected hand but adequate performances for the less affected hand. Object-manipulation studies reported hand posture planning deficits irrespectively of the hand assessed. CONCLUSIONS Motor planning deficits has been shown in the more affected hand for force scaling, while the results for other variables showed overall deficits. Hence, variables affected by motor planning deficits in both hands should be considered in children with cerebral palsy to optimize intervention.","Martinie, Ophélie; Mercier, Catherine; Gordon, Andrew M; Robert, Maxime T",Brain sciences,84,26

To investigate the DNA faecal prevalence of the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum, we sampled 23 lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) maternity colonies located in buildings (churches, barns) in rural villages of eastern France. A total of 552 faecal samples were collected from 278 individuals. Anaplasma phagocytophilum DNA was detected in the faeces of 63 individuals (22.7%). Such high prevalence might suggest persistent infection in bats and/or a frequent consumption of insect preys carrying bacteria. Faecal DNA prevalence varied highly among colonies but was not related to the colony size. Faecal DNA prevalence was the highest in the Jura Department, where the density of ticks is known to be the highest across the study area. Because the sampled bats live in close proximity to humans, we discuss how concerning the presence of A. phagocytophilum DNA in bat guano is for humans frequenting places of worship that shelter bats. We also advocate future research to understand what a high faecal DNA prevalence in bat guano really implicates in terms of bacteria transmission.","Afonso, E; Goydadin, A-C",Epidemiology and infection,84,16

Research shows residents in these homes make significant, sustained improvements. However, descriptions of recovery environments within the homes have been limited. PURPOSE The current study assessed psychometric properties for the Recovery Home Environment Scale (RHES), which assessed social environments within one type of recovery home, sober living houses (SLHs). METHODS 373 residents were interviewed at entry into the house, 1-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up. Measures included the RHES, other measures of the social environment, days of substance use, and length of stay. RESULTS Principal components analysis suggested the RHES was largely unidimensional. Exploratory factor analysis suggested items could be grouped into recovery support (3 items) and recovery skills (5 items). Cronbach's alphas for the full scale and the recovery support and recovery skills subscales were 0.91, 0.89, and 0.87, respectively. As hypothesized, construct validity of the RHES was supported by correlations with other measures of the social environment and predictive validity was supported by associations with length of stay and substance use. CONCLUSIONS SLHs have been described as ""the setting is the service."" However, the field has lacked a way to capture characteristics of the social environment. The RHES represents a new way to measure the recovery environment by focusing on social interactions among residents within SLHs and shared activities in the community.","Polcin, Douglas L; Mahoney, Elizabeth; Mericle, Amy A",Substance use & misuse,84,27

METHODS This international, observational cohort study comprised 1137 consecutive patients with head and neck cancer undergoing primary surgery with curative intent in 26 countries. Factors associated with severe pulmonary complications in COVID-19-positive patients and infections in the surgical team were determined by univariate analysis. RESULTS Among the 1137 patients, the commonest sites were the oral cavity (38%) and the thyroid (21%). For oropharynx and larynx tumors, nonsurgical therapy was favored in most cases. There was evidence of surgical de-escalation of neck management and reconstruction. Overall 30-day mortality was 1.2%. Twenty-nine patients (3%) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within 30 days of surgery; 13 of these patients (44.8%) developed severe respiratory complications, and 3.51 (10.3%) died. There were significant correlations with an advanced tumor stage and admission to critical care. Members of the surgical team tested positive within 30 days of surgery in 40 cases (3%). There were significant associations with operations in which the patients also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 30 days, with a high community incidence of SARS-CoV-2, with screened patients, with oral tumor sites, and with tracheostomy. CONCLUSIONS Head and neck cancer surgery in the COVID-19 era appears safe even when surgery is prolonged and complex. The overlap in COVID-19 between patients and members of the surgical team raises the suspicion of failures in cross-infection measures or the use of personal protective equipment. LAY SUMMARY Head and neck surgery is safe for patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic even when it is lengthy and complex. This is significant because concerns over patient safety raised in many guidelines appear not to be reflected by outcomes, even for those who have other serious illnesses or require complex reconstructions. Patients subjected to suboptimal or nonstandard treatments should be carefully followed up to optimize their cancer outcomes. The overlap between patients and surgeons testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is notable and emphasizes the need for fastidious cross-infection controls and effective personal protective equipment.",,Cancer,84,16

Geriatric assessment (GA) has been increasingly recognised as a predictive and prehabilitative tool for older adults with cancer. However, GA has been notoriously difficult to implement in oncological settings due to workforce, economic, logistical, and practical barriers. We aimed to review the heterogenous literature on implementation of GA in oncology settings to understand the different implementation context configurations of GA and the mechanisms they trigger to enable successful implementation. A systematic realist review was undertaken in two stages: i) systematic searches with structured data extraction combined with iterative key stakeholder consultations to develop programme theories for implementing GA in oncology settings; ii) synthesis to refine programme theories. Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, ASSIA, Epistemonikos, JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports, DARE and Health Technology Assessment were searched. Four programme theories were developed from 53 included articles and 20 key stakeholder consultations addressing the major barriers of GA implementation in oncology practice: time (leveraging non-specialists), funding (creating favourable health economics), practicalities (establishing the use of GA in cancer care), and managing limited resources. We demonstrate that a whole system approach is required to improve the implementation of GA in cancer settings. This review will help inform policy decisions regarding implementation of GA and provide a basis for further implementation research.","McKenzie, Gordon A G; Bullock, Alex F; Greenley, Sarah L; Lind, Michael J; Johnson, Miriam J; Pearson, Mark",Journal of geriatric oncology,84,1

We aimed to understand what factors influence the successful implementation of indicated psychological interventions within schools and colleges to help guide increased provision of mental health support within education settings. METHODS Systematic search for studies that have reported barriers or facilitators to the implementation of indicated interventions for adolescent emotional disorders delivered within schools and further education/sixth form colleges (CRD42018102830). Databases searched were EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, British Nursing Index, ASSIA, ERIC and British Education Index. A thematic synthesis of factors reported to impact implementation was conducted. RESULTS Two thousand five hundred and sixty-nine records and 177 full texts were screened. Fifty studies were identified for inclusion, all of which were of school-based interventions. Eleven analytic themes were developed encompassing intervention characteristics, organisational capacity, training and technical assistance, provider characteristics and community-level factors. Findings indicate the need to select appropriate interventions, consider logistical challenges of the school context and provide training and supervision to enable staff to deliver interventions with fidelity. However, structural and environmental support is required for these facilitators to have the greatest impact on successful implementation. CONCLUSIONS Implementing indicated school-based mental health interventions is challenging. Those involved in planning school-based mental health initiatives must be alert to the impact of factors on multiple interacting levels. There is a lack of research on implementing mental health support within further education and sixth form colleges. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE Increased utilisation of schools and colleges as a setting for early intervention has been proposed as a means of improving access to mental health treatment, but successful implementation of mental health interventions within educational settings is challenging. Based on a synthesis of current evidence, we recommend that young people and education professionals should be involved in the selection of school-based interventions to ensure they are acceptable and practical to deliver within the logistical constraints of the school environment. Those delivering interventions within schools, as well as staff involved in identifying young people who might benefit from these interventions, must receive high-quality ongoing training and support. Senior school leaders play an important role in championing mental health interventions and developing a school culture that prioritises mental well-being. Health and education policy should be designed to promote a cross-sector focus on the emotional health of young people. There is a lack of evidence on the implementation of indicated psychological interventions within sixth form and further education colleges.","Gee, Brioney; Wilson, Jon; Clarke, Tim; Farthing, Sophie; Carroll, Ben; Jackson, Christopher; King, Kahfee; Murdoch, Jamie; Fonagy, Peter; Notley, Caitlin",Child and adolescent mental health,84,1

This study aimed to investigate the vascular anatomy of the muscle-sparing variant and to describe its application as a free flap based on the descending branch of the thoracodorsal artery. METHODS Twelve fresh cadavers underwent anatomical dissection and angiographic injection studies of the thoracodorsal arterial system. The musculocutaneous territories of the descending and transverse branches to the latissimus dorsi muscle were identified and assessed using three-dimensional reconstruction software of computed tomography imaging results. In the clinical study, five patients underwent reconstruction of a variety of defects using the free descending branch muscle-sparing latissimus dorsi flap. RESULTS Three- and four-dimensional (computed tomography) angiography demonstrated perfusion of the latissimus dorsi muscle by the transverse and descending branches, with overlap of vascular territories via cross-linking vessels. The descending branch supplied a slightly greater cutaneous area overlying the muscle, although differences between both branches were not significant (p = 0.76). In the clinical study, the free muscle-sparing latissimus dorsi flap provided excellent coverage with no flap complications or seroma. CONCLUSIONS The free muscle-sparing latissimus dorsi flap based on the descending branch of the thoracodorsal artery is a viable reconstructive option. Significant collateral flow between vessels allows for larger flap harvest than would be expected. The flap is technically simple to harvest, provides a large perfusion area, and is a reliable variant of the full latissimus dorsi flap.

Selected critical material attributes were amount of phospholipid (X1), concentration of ethanol (X2), and amount of sodium cholate (X3). The prepared transethosomal vesicles were incorporated into carbopol gel base and evaluated. Ultraviolet radiation-induced skin-aging and oxidative stress model in Swiss Albino mice was used to evaluate the clinical potential of the developed formulation and compared with conventional gel. Levels of SOD, Catalase, Glutathione peroxidase, protein content, and malondialdehyde were measured to assess the extent of lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species inhibition in different groupsResult: DoE was successfully employed to optimize the vesicular formulation. Vesicle size was found to be 158.9 ± 7.65 nm, while values of entrapment efficiency and skin deposition were found to be 77.83 ± 2.87% and 371.84 ± 5.12 µg cm-2 respectively. Visual skin grading and histopathological studies confirmed the higher efficacy of transethosomal resveratrol against oxidative stress.

In May 2020, the adult UVA CF program redesigned the care model to adjust to the reopening of ambulatory operations and introduced hybrid clinics. The goal remained to minimize person-to-person contacts for patients and care team members (CTMs) while ensuring patient access to quarterly, coproduced, synchronous, multidisciplinary CF care, similar to pre-COVID-19 era regular CF care. Methods: Using quality improvement tools, the UVA adult CF program created a standardized hybrid model of care for in-clinic visits, which included combined components of in-person and synchronous virtual interactions with members of the multidisciplinary team. Results: A total of 16 hybrid visits occurred between May 14 and June 11, 2020. All hybrid visits were multidisciplinary and fulfilled patient requests to see CTMs. All patients seen by hybrid encounter participated in coproduced agenda setting, underwent spirometry, and obtained blood work; 75% provided sputum for surveillance culture. Each hybrid visit type was attended by an average of four CTMs and amounted to 63 separate interactions. Of these interactions, 28 were completed virtually, reducing in-person contacts and personal protection equipment utilization by 44% compared with a fully in-person model of care. Conclusions: Combining in-person and telehealth components in a multidisciplinary CF care model reduces patient and staff interactions and personal protective equipment utilization. The hybrid model of in-person/remote combined care enables reliable access to biological data to support medical decision making while mitigating the risks of person-to-person contact for patients and staff.","List, Rhonda; Compton, Martina; Soper, Morgan; Bruschwein, Heather; Gettle, Lucy; Bailey, Molly; Starheim, Elissa; Kalmanek, John; Somerville, Lindsay; Albon, Dana",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,84,26

Nevertheless, very elderly patients aged ≥90 years were either excluded or under-represented in previous trials. It remains uncertain whether MT is warranted for this population or whether there should be an upper age limit. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 79 patients with stroke aged ≥90 years from three neurointerventional centers who underwent MT between 2013 and 2017. Good functional outcome was defined as modified Rankin scale (mRS) ≤2 and assessed at 90-day follow-up. Successful recanalization was graded by Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Scale (TICI) ≥2 b. Feasibility and safety assessments included unsuccessful recanalization attempts (TICI 0), time from groin puncture to recanalization, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), mortality, and intervention-related serious adverse events. RESULTS Only occlusions within the anterior circulation were included. Median time from groin puncture to recanalization was 39 min (IQR 25-57 min). The rate of successful recanalization (TICI ≥2 b) was 69.6% (55/79). Good functional outcome (mRS ≤2) at 90 days was observed in 16% (12/75) of patients. In-hospital mortality was 29.1% (23/79) and increased significantly at 90 days (46.7%, 35/75; p<0.001). sICH occurred in 5.1% (4/79) of patients. No independent predictor for good functional outcome (mRS ≤2) at 90 days was identified through logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION MT in nonagenarians leads to high mortality rates and less frequently good functional outcome compared with younger patient cohorts in previous large randomized trials. However, MT appears to be safe and beneficial for a certain number of very elderly patients and therefore should generally not be withheld from nonagenarians.","Meyer, Lukas; Alexandrou, Maria; Leischner, Hannes; Flottmann, Fabian; Deb-Chatterji, Milani; Abdullayev, Nuran; Maus, Volker; Politi, Maria; Roth, Christian; Kastrup, Andreas; Thomalla, Goetz; Mpotsaris, Anastasios; Fiehler, Jens; Papanagiotou, Panagiotis",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,84,17

The innominate vein has been considered to be the vessel that is most frequently injured especially at the orifice of the thymic veins. We also suggest that the orifice of the left internal thoracic vein is the second dangerous location that requires special care. In addition, postoperative pericarditis occurred in this patient. Pericardial drainage was necessary. No additional complications have been found in the 9 months since the operation. Though VATS thymectomy using the subxiphoid approach is a safe and less-invasive operation, intraoperative and postoperative complications were possible to be occurred.","Yano, Motoki; Numanami, Hiroki; Yamaji, Masayuki; Taguchi, Rumiko; Furuta, Chihiro; Haniuda, Masayuki",Surgical case reports,84,22

Deciding to stop or continue anticoagulant therapy indefinitely after completing 3 to 6 months of initial treatment requires balancing the long-term risk of recurrent VTE if anticoagulation is stopped against the long-term risk of major bleeding if anticoagulation is continued. However, knowledge of the long-term risk for major bleeding events during extended anticoagulation in this patient population is limited. We plan to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the risk for major bleeding events during extended oral anticoagulation in patients with first unprovoked VTE. METHODS Electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be systematically searched with the assistance of an information specialist (from inception to March 1, 2019) to identify randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies reporting major bleeding during extended oral anticoagulation in patients with first unprovoked VTE, who have completed at least 3 months of initial anticoagulant therapy. Study selection, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction will be performed independently by at least two investigators. The number of major bleeding events and person-years of follow-up will be used to calculate the rate (events per 100 person-years) with its 95% confidence interval for each study cohort, during clinically relevant time periods of extended anticoagulant therapy. Results will be pooled using random effect meta-analysis. DISCUSSION The planned systematic review and meta-analysis will provide reliable estimates of the risk for major bleeding events during extended anticoagulation. This information will help inform patient prognosis and assist clinicians with balancing the risks and benefits of treatment to guide management of unprovoked VTE.

Three approaches were utilized to enhance the thermal-hydraulic performance-the variation of geometrical properties of a single canonical insert to find the optimized shape; the use of nanofluids and analysis of the effect of both the aforementioned approaches; the use of swirl generators and nanofluids together. Results revealed that using the straight conical strips alone enhanced the Nusselt number by 47.13%. However, the use of nanofluids along with the swirl generators increased the Nusselt number by 57.48%. These improvements reduced the thermal losses by 22.3% for swirl generators with nanofluids, as opposed to a reduction of only 15.7% with nanofluids alone. The investigation of different swirl generator designs showed various levels of improvements in terms of the overall thermal efficiency and thermal exergy efficiency. The larger swirl generator (H30mm-θ30°-N4) with 6% SiO2 nanofluids was found to be the optimum configuration, which improved the overall collector efficiency and thermal exergy by 14.62% and 14.47%, respectively.","Abed, Nabeel; Afgan, Imran; Iacovides, Hector; Cioncolini, Andrea; Khurshid, Ilyas; Nasser, Adel",Nanomaterials,84,1

The purpose of this study is to review and critically appraise evidence on the effectiveness of adherence therapy as an intervention in adults with type 2 diabetes. A systematic search of clinical trials published between 2005 and January 2020 in databases was undertaken in October 2018 and updated in August 2020. Inclusion criteria were any clinical trials where the population under investigation was adults with type 2 diabetes and the experimental intervention was adherence therapy. Version 2 of the Cochrane risk of bias was used to determine the quality of the included studies. No studies met our inclusion criteria. However, four studies that we excluded at full text screening tested some of the components (e.g., problem solving) of adherence therapy. As is recommended when reporting empty reviews, those studies were synthesized to determine if useful information can be extracted. That no trials of adherence therapy have been reported in type 2 diabetes establishes a potentially important gap in knowledge.

The purpose of this explanatory case study was to determine what, if any, impact the triad team would have on commonly measured operational and quality metrics: observed to expected length of stay, likelihood to recommend the hospital, hand-washing compliance, all-cause 30-day readmission rates, percent of discharges by noon, and percent of discharge to skilled nursing facilities. Over the course of a year triad units demonstrated improvement in most metrics in comparison to the baseline period. While trends for the metrics were favorable, most striking was a statistically significant improvement in the observed to expected length of stay ratio (1.25 to 1.15, p < 0.001) which is the organization's most widely used marker for efficient hospital patient flow. As a result of these sustained operational, safety, quality, and financial performance metrics the model is being generalized to other medical as well as surgical units, including our observation unit.

In order to prevent suicidal and other self-injurious behaviors, research on the multiple factors involved in these behaviors with comprehensive and user-friendly instruments is necessary. The aim of the current study was to construct a self-report instrument with emphasis on items describing suicide-related behavior itself rather than strongly related clinical features on the basis of a general population study. METHODS Twelve items comprising a new scale were applied to 734 subjects from the general population (40.6% males and 59.4% females) aged 40.8±11.5 along with the STAI and the CES-D. RESULTS The scoring method was developed on the basis of frequency table of responses to the individual scale items. The factor analysis returned 3 factors explaining 59.19% of total variance (Intention, Life, and History). The Cronbach's alpha was 0.85 for the Intention, 0.69 for the Life and 0.52 for the History subscale. LIMITATION The findings need replication in clinical and epidemiologic studies.

The risk of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 increases dramatically in the presence of co-existing medical conditions while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Furthermore, there are no proven effective therapies for COVID-19. This study aims to identify SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, diseases manifestations, and COVID-19 therapies using network medicine methodologies along with clinical and multi-omics observations. We incorporate SARS-CoV-2 virus-host protein-protein interactions, transcriptomics, and proteomics into the human interactome. Network proximity measure revealed underlying pathogenesis for broad COVID-19-associated manifestations. Multi-modal analyses of single-cell RNA-sequencing data showed that co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was elevated in absorptive enterocytes from the inflamed ileal tissues of Crohn's disease patients compared to uninflamed tissues, revealing shared pathobiology by COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel disease. Integrative analyses of metabolomics and transcriptomics (bulk and single-cell) data from asthma patients indicated that COVID-19 shared intermediate inflammatory endophenotypes with asthma (including IRAK3 and ADRB2).

OBJECTIVE To report initial experience with endovascular treatment of these aneurysms using flow-diverting stents (FDS). METHODS Ten patients with FDS treatment of complex vertebrobasilar junction aneurysms were collected from 4 large cerebrovascular centers. Clinical/angiographic presentation and outcome were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS Of 10 aneurysms, 7 presented with brainstem compression, 2 with ischemia, and 1 with subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 3 were recurrent after stent-assisted treatments. Eight were giant. Morphology was fusiform in 5, fusiform dissecting in 1, and multilobulated saccular in 4. Six were partially thrombosed. In addition to FDS (mean number of devices, 3.9; range, 1-9), contralateral vertebral artery sacrifice and adjunctive coiling were performed in 9 and 5 of the 10 patients, respectively. At follow-up, 5 of 10 were completely occluded, 4 showed minimal residual filling, and 1 was retreated with an additional FDS. Postinterventionally, worsening mass effect and ischemic complications were seen in 2 and 4 of 10, respectively. Clinical outcome was good in 6 (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2). Four fatalities were related to sequelae of subarachnoid hemorrhage, late FDS thrombosis, progressive mass effect, and delayed intracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSION FDS may be used to treat complex vertebrobasilar junction aneurysms with overall good angiographic outcome. A combined reconstructive/deconstructive approach appears useful to avoid endoleaks. FDS strategies, like other endovascular and neurosurgical approaches to these lesions, are associated with significant risk and therefore should be reserved for those cases in which alternative approaches either are deemed unsafe or are likely to be ineffective.

Even though hospitals are not as well placed to follow recommended standards of TB care, a significant proportion of people with TB symptoms seek care from hospitals. In spite of having a policy and mandate in place, the Ministry of Health had little success in encouraging hospitals to refer suspected TB cases to dispensaries. Following the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, the government set up a nationwide Internet-based communicable diseases reporting system. This achieved productive collaboration between hospitals and TB dispensaries. From 2004 to 2007, the percentage of TB suspects and patients needing referral from hospitals who arrived in TB dispensaries increased substantially from 58.7% to 77.8% and the contribution of hospitals to diagnosing sputum smear-positive TB cases doubled from 16.3% to 32.9%. Using the Internet-based reporting system, hospitals in China contributed to finding about one third of all sputum smear-positive TB cases and helped meet the global TB control target of detecting 70% of such cases. Based on the data available from routine surveillance facilitated by this Internet-based system, this paper details the process and outcomes of strengthening collaboration between hospitals and TB dispensaries using the Internet as a tool and its potential application to other country settings.","Wang, Lixia; Liu, Xiaoqiu; Huang, Fei; Hennig, Cornelia; Uplekar, Mukund; Jiang, Shiwen",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,84,5

The complex contouring between the orbital roof and frontal bone creates significant design challenges for prefabricated cranio-orbital reconstructions. In describing the first reported patient of combined skull and orbital roof reconstruction with a single-piece titanium plate cranioplasty, the authors present a new method of combined complex cranio-orbital reconstruction. METHODS A 63-year-old lady presented with a large, right-sided frontal en-plaque meningioma involving the right orbit and sphenoid wing. Complete resection would require reconstruction of both the skull and the orbital roof. Surgical preplanning involved marking resection margins on a three-dimensional (3D) printed acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene model. This margin was used to virtually resect the tumor and generate a repaired surface. A titanium plate was then fabricated using hydrostatic pressing into a 3D-printed mold and the orbital roof portion (a reentrant surface) was hand-finished. Lateral canthus and temporalis muscle suspension holes were prefabricated into the cranioplasty plate. RESULTS The patient underwent hemicraniectomy and tumor resection guided by a custom-made 3D-printed cutting guide. The surgical defect was reconstructed with the prefabricated titanium plate achieving a good functional and cosmetic result.

Within the neuroimaging community, Open Science practices are taking the form of open data repositories and open lab notebooks. The broad sharing of data that accompanies Open Science, however, raises some difficult ethical and legal issues. With neuroethics as a focusing lens, we explore eight central concerns posed by open data with regard to human brain imaging studies: respect for individuals and communities, concern for marginalized communities, consent, privacy protections, participatory research designs, contextual integrity, fusions of clinical and research goals, and incidental findings. Each consideration assists in bringing nuance to the potential benefits for open data sharing against associated challenges. We combine current understandings with forward-looking solutions to key issues. We conclude by underscoring the need for new policy tools to enhance the potential for responsible open data.","Beauvais, Michael J S; Knoppers, Bartha Maria; Illes, Judy",NeuroImage,84,17

People with HF experience substantial burden that includes low exercise tolerance, poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL), increased risk of mortality and hospital admission, and high healthcare costs. The previous (2014) Cochrane systematic review reported that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) compared to no exercise control shows improvement in HRQoL and hospital admission among people with HF, as well as possible reduction in mortality over the longer term, and that these reductions appear to be consistent across patient and programme characteristics. Limitations noted by the authors of this previous Cochrane Review include the following: (1) most trials were undertaken in patients with HF with reduced (< 45%) ejection fraction (HFrEF), and women, older people, and those with preserved (≥ 45%) ejection fraction HF (HFpEF) were under-represented; and (2) most trials were undertaken in the hospital/centre-based setting. OBJECTIVES To determine the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation on mortality, hospital admission, and health-related quality of life of people with heart failure. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and three other databases on 29 January 2018. We also checked the bibliographies of systematic reviews and two trial registers. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials that compared exercise-based CR interventions with six months' or longer follow-up versus a no exercise control that could include usual medical care. The study population comprised adults (> 18 years) with evidence of HF - either HFrEF or HFpEF. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened all identified references and rejected those that were clearly ineligible for inclusion in the review. We obtained full papers of potentially relevant trials. Two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials, assessed their risk of bias, and performed GRADE analyses. MAIN RESULTS We included 44 trials (5783 participants with HF) with a median of six months' follow-up. For this latest update, we identified 11 new trials (N = 1040), in addition to the previously identified 33 trials. Although the evidence base includes predominantly patients with HFrEF with New York Heart Association classes II and III receiving centre-based exercise-based CR programmes, a growing body of studies include patients with HFpEF and are undertaken in a home-based setting. All included studies included a no formal exercise training intervention comparator. However, a wide range of comparators were seen across studies that included active intervention (i.e. education, psychological intervention) or usual medical care alone. The overall risk of bias of included trials was low or unclear, and we downgraded results using the GRADE tool for all but one outcome.Cardiac rehabilitation may make little or no difference in all-cause mortality over the short term (≤ one year of follow-up) (27 trials, 28 comparisons (2596 participants): intervention 67/1302 (5.1%) vs control 75/1294 (5.8%); risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.21; low-quality GRADE evidence) but may improve all-cause mortality in the long term (> 12 months follow up) (6 trials/comparisons (2845 participants): intervention 244/1418 (17.2%) vs control 280/1427 (19.6%) events): RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.02; high-quality evidence). Researchers provided no data on deaths due to HF. CR probably reduces overall hospital admissions in the short term (up to one year of follow-up) (21 trials, 21 comparisons (2182 participants): (intervention 180/1093 (16.5%) vs control 258/1089 (23.7%); RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.83; moderate-quality evidence, number needed to treat: 14) and may reduce HF-specific hospitalisation (14 trials, 15 comparisons (1114 participants): (intervention 40/562 (7.1%) vs control 61/552 (11.1%) RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.84; low-quality evidence, number needed to treat: 25). After CR, a clinically important improvement in short-term disease-specific health-related quality of life may be evident (Minnesota Living With Heart Failure questionnaire - 17 trials, 18 comparisons (1995 participants): mean difference (MD) -7.11 points, 95% CI -10.49 to -3.73; low-quality evidence). Pooling across all studies, regardless of the HRQoL measure used, shows there may be clinically important improvement with exercise (26 trials, 29 comparisons (3833 participants); standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.60, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.39; I² = 87%; Chi² = 215.03; low-quality evidence). ExCR effects appeared to be consistent different models of ExCR delivery: centre vs. home-based, exercise dose, exercise only vs. comprehensive programmes, and aerobic training alone vs aerobic plus resistance programmes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This updated Cochrane Review provides additional randomised evidence (11 trials) to support the conclusions of the previous version (2014) of this Cochane Review. Compared to no exercise control, CR appears to have no impact on mortality in the short term (< 12 months' follow-up). Low- to moderate-quality evidence shows that CR probably reduces the risk of all-cause hospital admissions and may reduce HF-specific hospital admissions in the short term (up to 12 months). CR may confer a clinically important improvement in health-related quality of life, although we remain uncertain about this because the evidence is of low quality. Future ExCR trials need to continue to consider the recruitment of traditionally less represented HF patient groups including older, female, and HFpEF patients, and alternative CR delivery settings including home- and using technology-based programmes.","Long, Linda; Mordi, Ify R; Bridges, Charlene; Sagar, Viral A; Davies, Edward J; Coats, Andrew Js; Dalal, Hasnain; Rees, Karen; Singh, Sally J; Taylor, Rod S",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,84,24

DESIGN Exploratory study. SUBJECTS Dutch children (age 5-19 years) with spina bifida who use a manual wheelchair. METHODS For the dependent variable physical activity, data from 2 physical activity monitors were analysed: VitaMove data for 34 participants and Actiheart data for 36 participants. Time sedentary, time physically active, and time in moderate to vigorous physical activity were analysed. The Wheelchair Shuttle Test was used to measure VO2peak. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed. Independent variables were VO2peak, age, sex, and Hoffer classification. RESULTS Time sedentary and time physically active during a school day were influenced by age (β=0.326/β=-0.320) and Hoffer classification (β=0.409/β=-0.534) and during a weekend day by Hoffer classification (β=0.617/β=-0.428). Time in moderate to vigorous physical activity was influenced by Hoffer classification (β=-0.527) during a school day and by age (β=-0.600) during a weekend day. CONCLUSION Older age and the inability to walk negatively influence physical activity. Sex and VO2peak were not associated with physical activity. These results imply that increasing cardiorespiratory fitness alone will not improve physical activity in young wheelchair-users with spina bifida.","Bloemen, Manon A T; Takken, Tim; de Groot, Janke F; Kruitwagen, Cas L J J; Rooks, Rosanne A; van den Berg-Emons, Rita H J G; Backx, Frank J G",Journal of rehabilitation medicine,84,29

Dome-down laparoscopic cholecystectomy provides the ability to evaluate the cystic duct circumferentially prior to its division, thus minimizing the risks of bile duct injury. This study assesses the feasibility and safety of SILC using a modified dome-down approach with all conventional laparoscopic instruments. METHODS Three low-profile 5-mm trocars are placed via a single transumbilical incision. The two working trocars are aimed laterally via the rectus to achieve adequate triangulation. An extralong 5-mm 30º laparoscope with an L-shaped light-cord adaptor is used to yield more external working space. Cephalic liver retraction is achieved with one transabdominal suture through the gallbladder fundus. Leaving the gallbladder fundus attached to the liver bed, a window is first created between the gallbladder body and the liver. The dissection is then carried down retrograde toward the porta hepatis. A 360º view of the gallbladder-cystic duct junction is achieved prior to transecting the cystic duct. The gallbladder is then freed by separation of the fundal attachments. The specimen is retrieved by enlarging the fascial incision. All fascial defects are then primarily closed. RESULTS Sixteen patients (mean age 31 years, mean BMI 26.3 kg/m(2)) were enrolled in this study. Thirteen had elective surgery for symptomatic cholelithiasis, and three had emergency surgery for acute cholecystitis. Mean operating time was 80.3 min, and blood loss was minimal. All patients were discharged within 24 h without complications. Follow-up at 1 month revealed a barely visible scar within the umbilicus. CONCLUSIONS SILC using a modified dome-down approach is technically feasible with all straight instruments, and it is safe because of good delineation of ductal anatomy. Adoption of this approach may minimize the risk of bile duct injury during early experience of SILC.","Cui, Hongyi; Kelly, John J; Litwin, Demetrius E M",Surgical endoscopy,84,11

The current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlights the devastating toll that respiratory viruses have on humanity and the desperate need to understand the biological characteristics that define them in order to develop efficacious treatments and vaccines. To date, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected nearly 600 times more people and resulted in 200 times more deaths relative to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) combined. OBJECTIVE Through this review, we aim to summarize the key characteristics of respiratory viruses that hold global significance, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2. Our goal is to disseminate our current knowledge of these infectious agents to otolaryngologists, in particular rhinologists, practicing in the COVID-19 era. METHODS The general and clinical characteristics of selected respiratory viruses along with available viral treatments and vaccines are reviewed. RESULTS There has been significant progress in our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of various respiratory viruses. However, despite the advancement in knowledge, efficacious vaccines and antiviral treatments remain elusive for most respiratory viruses. The dire need for these scientific discoveries is highlighted by the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which has prompted investigators worldwide to conduct clinical trials at an accelerated timeline in an effort to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rhinologists will continue to remain on the front-lines of pandemics associated with respiratory viruses. CONCLUSION In light of these unprecedented times, the need to understand the nuances of these viral respiratory pathogens, especially SARS-CoV-2, cannot be overemphasized. This knowledge base is of particular importance to otolaryngologists, whose expertise in the upper airway coincides with the anatomic tropism of these infectious agents.","Yuen, Erick; Gudis, David A; Rowan, Nicholas R; Nguyen, Shaun A; Schlosser, Rodney J",American journal of rhinology & allergy,84,1

It is unclear whether people perceive this principle as ethically more legitimate than some other principle such as ""saving more life-years"". Understanding the answer to this question is particularly relevant to the allocation of scarce medical resources during public health emergencies. Different principles typically lead to different allocations, and consequently have dramatically different implications as to who survives and who dies. We fielded an online randomized controlled survey experiment in the context of scarce ventilator allocation with a demographically representative sample of US adults (n = 700) from October 22 to October 30, 2020. Participants faced hypothetical situations where they had to allocate few available ventilators among several needy patients. The experiment was designed such that the allocation decision made by a participant can be used to infer the principle in line with their personal ethical values. We interpret this inferred principle as the one that the participant perceives to be most legitimate. The treatment group, but not the control group, was provided balanced information that described the ethical dilemmas faced by experts in developing ventilator allocation guidelines. Nearly half of the participants in the control group perceive saving more lives the most legitimate principle. Despite the balanced nature of the information, the perceived legitimacy of saving more lives was 7·6 percentage points higher in the treatment group. The magnitude of this impact was particularly strong among republican-leaning participants, a subgroup that has less trust in experts according to previous research. Our findings suggest that enhancing public awareness of ethical dilemmas faced by health experts can increase the perceived legitimacy of their proposed guidelines even among those with lower trust in experts.","Rai, Birendra; Wang, Liang Choon; Pandit, Simone; Handfield, Toby; So, Chiu Ki",Social science & medicine,84,16

We report the in-hospital characteristics of patients with acute myocardial infarction and concomitant COVID-19. METHODS This was a registry-based retrospective analysis of patients admitted with positive COVID-19 tests who suffered acute myocardial infarction either before or during hospitalization; from 1 March 2020 to 1 April 2020 in a tertiary cardiovascular center-Tehran Heart Center. We performed an exploratory analysis to compare the clinical characteristics of patients who died during hospitalization or were discharged alive. RESULTS In March 2020, 57 patients who had acute myocardial infarction and a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in the study. During hospitalization, 13 patients (22.8%) died after a mean hospital stay of 8.4 days. The deceased were older than the survivors. No significant association between mortality and sex or length of hospital stay was observed. Hypertensive individuals were more likely to have a fatal outcome. Previously receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers did not show any association with mortality. Regarding the laboratory data during hospitalization, higher cardiac troponin T, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, urea, and blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio were observed in the mortality group. The deceased had a lower lymphocyte count than the survivors.

Treatment is focused on accurately disconnecting the fistula point. We present our experience with the double-cone-beam CT fusion technique successfully applied to evaluate treatment results in a series of SDAVFs. METHODS Between November 2011 and December 2015 we performed double-DynaCT acquisition (pre- and post-embolisation) in 12 cases of SDAVF. RESULTS A successful DynaCT fusion technique was only achieved in the group of patients with pre- and post-treatment images acquired at the same time as the treatment session, under general anaesthesia (4/12). DynaCT performed on different days proved to be inadequate for the automated fusion technique because of changes in the body position (8/12). CONCLUSIONS A pre-treatment flat-panel cone-beam CT with contrast, at the time of diagnostic angiography, can be very helpful to detect the correct level of the fistula and the relationship between the fistula and the surrounding structures. In case of the endovascular approach, additional post-treatment native acquisition merged with the pre-treatment acquisition (double-cone-beam CT fusion technique) permits to immediately evaluate the distribution of the glue cast and to confirm the success of the procedure. KEY POINTS • SDAVF treatment must be aimed to occlude the fistula point shunt. • Native post-operative cone-beam CT permits high-spatial-resolution imaging of the embolic cast. • The automated double-cone-beam CT fusion technique (pre/post) accurately demonstrates intravascular glue distribution after embolisation. • Patient movements should be avoided to obtain good technical results.","Faragò, Giuseppe; Caldiera, V; Antozzi, C; Bellino, A; Innocenti, A; Ciceri, E",European radiology,84,16

The role of retromer in the retrograde sorting of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR, also known as IGF2R) from endosomes back to the trans-Golgi network remains controversial. Here, by applying knocksideways technology, we develop a method for acute retromer inactivation. While retromer knocksideways in HeLa and H4 human neuroglioma cells resulted in time-resolved defects in cell surface sorting of GLUT1, we failed to observe a quantifiable defect in CI-MPR sorting. In contrast, knocksideways of the ESCPE-1 complex - a key regulator of retrograde CI-MPR sorting - revealed time-resolved defects in CI-MPR sorting. Together, these data are consistent with a comparatively limited role for retromer in ESCPE-1-mediated CI-MPR retrograde sorting, and establish a methodology for acute retromer and ESCPE-1 inactivation that will aid the time-resolved dissection of their functional roles in endosomal cargo sorting.","Evans, Ashley J; Daly, James L; Anuar, Anis N K; Simonetti, Boris; Cullen, Peter J",Journal of cell science,84,10

The perioperative clinician is faced with a myriad of devices promising to deliver relevant physiologic data to better guide fluid therapy. The goal of this review is to provide concise information to enable the clinician to make an informed decision when choosing a device to guide goal-directed fluid therapy. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS The focus of many devices used for advanced hemodynamic monitoring is on providing measurements of cardiac output, while other, more recent, devices include estimates of fluid responsiveness based on dynamic indices that better predict an individual's response to a fluid bolus. Currently available technologies include the pulmonary artery catheter, esophageal Doppler, arterial waveform analysis, photoplethysmography, venous oxygen saturation, as well as bioimpedance and bioreactance. The underlying mechanistic principles for each device are presented as well as their performance in clinical trials relevant for goal-directed therapy in ERAS. CONCLUSIONS The ERAS protocols typically involve a multipronged regimen to facilitate early recovery after surgery. Optimizing perioperative fluid therapy is a key component of these efforts. While no technology is without limitations, the majority of the currently available literature suggests esophageal Doppler and arterial waveform analysis to be the most desirable choices to guide fluid administration. Their performance is dependent, in part, on the interpretation of dynamic changes resulting from intrathoracic pressure fluctuations encountered during mechanical ventilation. Evolving practice patterns, such as low tidal volume ventilation as well as the necessity to guide fluid therapy in spontaneously breathing patients, will require further investigation.","Thiele, Robert H; Bartels, Karsten; Gan, Tong-Joo",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,84,16

However, some items of the CAS-BR were stronger indicators of the coronavirus anxiety construct for women and younger adults. Although the CAS-BR demonstrated evidence of discrimination ability for functional impairment (AUC = .77), Youden indexes were low to identify a clinical cut-score.

However, the contribution of SEB towards S. aureus pathogenesis has never been directly demonstrated with genetically defined mutants in clinically relevant strains. Many isolates of the predominant Asian community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) lineage ST59 harbor seb, implying a significant role of SEB in the observed hypervirulence of this lineage. We created an isogenic seb mutant in a representative ST59 isolate and assessed its virulence potential in mouse infection models. We detected a significant contribution of seb to systemic ST59 infection that was associated with a cytokine storm. Our results directly demonstrate that seb contributes to S. aureus pathogenesis, suggesting value of including SEB as a target in multi-pronged anti-staphylococcal drug development strategies. Furthermore, they indicate that seb contributes to fatal exacerbation of CA-MRSA infection.","Bae, Justin S; Da, Fei; Liu, Ryan; He, Lei; Lv, Huiying; Fisher, Emilie L; Rajagopalan, Govindarajan; Li, Min; Cheung, Gordon Y C; Otto, Michael",The Journal of infectious diseases,84,19

In the elderly, the potential benefit of conjugate vaccines is unclear. Here, we explore the early kinetics of serum antibody and circulating plasma and memory B cell responses to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (PPS) in older adults (n=37) immunised a PPV vaccine, Pneumovax or a PCV: Prevenar. All individuals had serum evidence of pre-existing serotype-specific immunity. Following immunisation, a day 7 rise in circulating PPS-specific plasma and memory antibody secreting cells (AbSCs) was detected in both vaccine groups and this was sustained to day 28 in some PCV recipients. There was no difference between vaccine groups in serum antibody responses or the kinetics of the early PBMC-derived B cell responses. Although our sample cohort was small, these data are different from profiles in younger individuals at early time points post-immunisation and suggest that pneumococcal conjugate vaccines may not quantitatively enhance the generation of memory responses in the elderly.","Baxendale, Helen E; Keating, Sheila M; Johnson, Marina; Southern, Jo; Miller, Elizabeth; Goldblatt, David",Vaccine,84,31

It is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) originating in Wuhan, China. It has been seen that fewer children contract COVID-19 and among infected, children have less severe disease. Insights in pathophysiological mechanisms of less severity in children could be important for devising therapeutics for high-risk adults and elderly. Early closing of schools and day-care centers led to less frequent exposure and hence, lower infection rate in children. The expression of primary target receptor for SARS-CoV-2, i.e. angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), decreases with age. ACE-2 has lung protective effects by limiting angiotensin-2 mediated pulmonary capillary leak and inflammation. Severe COVID-19 disease is associated with high and persistent viral loads in adults. Children have strong innate immune response due to trained immunity (secondary to live-vaccines and frequent viral infections), leading to probably early control of infection at the site of entry. Adult patients show suppressed adaptive immunity and dysfunctional over-active innate immune response in severe infections, which is not seen in children. These could be related to immune-senescence in elderly. Excellent regeneration capacity of pediatric alveolar epithelium may be contributing to early recovery from COVID-19. Children, less frequently, have risk factors such as co-morbidities, smoking, and obesity. But young infants and children with pre-existing illnesses could be high risk groups and need careful monitoring. Studies describing immune-pathogenesis in COVID-19 are lacking in children and need urgent attention.","Dhochak, Nitin; Singhal, Tanu; Kabra, S K; Lodha, Rakesh",Indian journal of pediatrics,84,31

Methods Individuals of age more than or equal to 5 years were recruited from 274 wards of the state (population ~ 19.6 million) during January 11 to January 22, 2021. A total of 100 participants each were included from all the wards for a net sample size of ~28,000. A multi-stage sampling technique was applied for selection of participants for the household serosurvey. Anti SARS CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected by using the VITROS assay (90% Sn, 100% Sp). Results Antibody positivity was observed in 14,298 (50.76%) of the 28,169 samples. The age, sex and district population weighted seroprevalence of the IgG SARS-CoV-2 was 50.52% (95% C.I. 49.94-51.10) and after adjustment for assay characteristics was 56.13% (95% C.I. 55.49- 56.77). On adjusted analysis, participants aged more than or equal to 50 years, of female gender, housewives, having ever lived in containment zones, urban slum dwellers, and diabetes or hypertensive patients had significantly higher odds of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity. The peak infection rate and the test positivity rate since October 2020 were initially observed in mid-November 2020 with a subsequent steep declining trend, followed by a period of persistently low case burden lasting until the first week of March 2021. This was followed by a steady increase followed by an exponential surge in infections from April 2021 onwards culminating in the second wave of the pandemic.

The impact of poor adherence on the effectiveness of chronic disease treatment is severe in terms of poorer health outcomes and increased health care costs (2). Information regarding covid-19 on adherence behavior in Latin-American is scarce. Objectives: The aim of this study is to describe impact of COVID-19 outbreak on adherence behavior in Latin-American population with rheumatic diseases. Methods: We carried out a descriptive, cross-sectional, self-report study through voluntary telephonic survey, to determine adherence behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, from September 9th, 2020 to November 19th, 2020, for consecutive patients of the outpatient rheumatology clinic in the Hospital Universitario (Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico), which serves a resource limited population that lack access to health insurance, from five neighboring states. A 17-items survey was designed. Baseline demographics that were collected included age, sex, rheumatologic diagnosis, current medications and patient perception of disease control. Patients were asked if they continued follow-up care, last prescribed therapy and reasons. Also, the survey assessed whether patients had any issues with medication supply and where they were obtaining information about covid-19 (could choose as many options as applicable). Transferred to SPSS for analysis for descriptive statistics. Results: A total of 150 patients were called, the survey response rate was 54.6% (n=82), with a mean completion time of 10 minutes. The mean +/-SD age of the participants was 52 +/-15.9 years, and 95% were female. The most common self-reported diagnoses were rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (13.4%) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (13.4%) [Table 1]. Patient perception of disease control was primary good 37.8% and regular 35.4%. Patients that continued their follow-up with their rheumatologist (on the clinic face-to-face, electronically or telehealth) or in another clinic were 26.9%, the majority were nonadherent 73%. Persistence to treatment was 82.9%, the main reason to discontinue therapy was lack of prescriptions or medical advice 8.5% and overall 58.5% had trouble finding their medicine. Information regarding covid-19 was mainly obtained by television (health secretary conference) 90.2%, and the least directly from their doctor 4.8%. Conclusion: Patients continue their therapeutic regimen, still many of them have trouble finding their medications, which affects the disease control. Also, despite having a poor disease control (majority between regular and bad) they are not continuing their follow-up care, more objective studies are needed to determine a specific cause.

These surveys included nine questionnaires on psychiatric symptoms, such as depression and anxiety. Multi-dimensional psychiatric time series data were then decomposed into four principal components. We used generalized linear models to identify modulating factors for effects of the pandemic on these components. The four principal components can be interpreted as general psychiatric burden, social withdrawal, alcohol-related problems, and depression/anxiety. Principal components associated with general psychiatric burden and depression/anxiety peaked during the initial phase of the pandemic. They were further exacerbated by the economic burden of the pandemic. In contrast, principal components associated with social withdrawal showed a delayed peak, with human relationships as an important risk modulating factor. In addition, being elderly and female were risk factors shared across all components. Our results show that COVID-19 has imposed a large and varied burden on the Japanese population since the commencement of the pandemic.

This is an in-depth research with data obtained by interviewing 35 bamboo craftsmen with various products and production scales. The results showed that craftsmen were not economically affected by the pandemic rather by the central government-stipulated regulation on social distancing, which led to their inability to transport their product from Tasikmalaya to Jakarta and other regions. However, since the government lifted the ban, their income has increased by an average of 2%. The result further showed that the main factor that keeps craftsmen from being negatively affected by the pandemic is the increasing online market demand supported by the availability of raw materials and the ability to adapt to various new model products.

Augmenting staff: project XTREME.,18.61175,10.725484,2008,"We identified 1219 articles published in 2006 that described work performed using commercial optical biosensor platforms. It is interesting to witness how the biosensor market is maturing with an increased number of instrument manufacturers offering a wider variety of platforms. However, it is clear from a review of the results presented that the advances in technology are outpacing the skill level of the average biosensor user. While we can track a gradual improvement in the quality of the published work, we clearly have a long way to go before we capitalize on the full potential of biosensor technology. To illustrate what is right with the biosensor literature, we highlight the work of 10 groups who have their eye on the ball. To help out the rest of us who have the lights on but nobody home, we use the literature to address common myths about biosensor technology.","Rich, Rebecca L; Myszka, David G",Journal of molecular recognition : JMR,84,16

The ELISA detected IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV in all 74 convalescent-phase samples from SARS patients while weakly cross-reacting to only 1 of the 210 control sera from healthy donors. This finding thus led to a kit sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100, 99.5, and 99.6%, respectively. The test thus provided a positive predictive value (PPV) of 98.7% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%. In addition, the ELISA gave a positive delta of 5.4 and a negative delta of 3.6, indicating an excellent differentiation between positives and negatives. The same recombinant proteins were also applied to a newly developed platform for the development of a 15-min rapid test. The resulting rapid test has an excellent agreement of 99.6%, with a kappa value of 1.00, with the ELISA. Again, this rapid test was able to detect 100% of the samples tested (n = 42) while maintaining a specificity of 99.0% (n = 210). The PPV and NPV for the rapid test thus reached 95.3 and 100%, respectively.","Guan, Ming; Chen, Hsiao Ying; Foo, Shen Yun; Tan, Yee-Joo; Goh, Phuay-Yee; Wee, Shock Hwa",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,84,19

We review the development of HIV/AIDS surveillance and its multiple data sources to monitor the dynamics of HIV/AIDS in China. The surveillance system for HIV/AIDS in China was initiated in 1986. It has evolved in three stages: (1) passive surveillance, (2) HIV sentinel surveillance with coexisting active surveillance and passive surveillance, and (3) comprehensive surveillance. In parallel with the evolution of the surveillance system itself, the HIV epidemic in China has gone through increasing stages of complexity, through an Introduction Phase, a Spreading Phase, and a Rapidy Spreading Phase. More reliable data from improved surveillance suggest that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is expanding in China. HIV infections among 2005 estimates remain concentrated among injection drug users (IDUs), those buying and selling sex, and men who have sex with men. Better HIV/AIDS surveillance synthesizes multiple data sources to provide a more accurate picture of the dynamics of specific HIV/AIDS circumstances in different areas of China. Improved surveillance is meaningful insofar as data are used to implement more effective HIV prevention programs in China. Support for surveillance and strategic analyses can enable policy decision makers to make more effective program choices and mobilize adequate resources to contain HIV.","Jia, Yujiang; Lu, Fan; Sun, Xinhua; Vermund, Sten H",The Southeast Asian journal of tropical medicine and public health,84,1

For the formation of these particles only the M and the E protein are required; the S protein is dispensable but is incorporated when present. As we illustrate here, this virus-like particle assembly system is an ideal tool to study the interactions between the essential assembly partners M and E in molecular detail. Taking a mutagenetic approach we demonstrate that envelope assembly is critically sensitive to changes in the primary structure of both terminal domains of the M protein. The effects were most dramatically observed after mutation of the carboxy-terminal domain where the deletion of just one single amino acid at the extreme terminus abolished particle formation almost completely. But also some subtle mutations in the amino-terminal domain were severely inhibitory to the assembly process. Interestingly, mutant M proteins that were themselves incompetent to support particle formation appeared to inhibit, in a concentration dependent manner, the assembly of particles by wild-type M and E protein.","de Haan, C A; Vennema, H; Rottier, P J",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,84,1

Two types of rota-viral particles were observed: with and without supercapsids. Also two types of corona-viral particles were established. The first type was relatively monomorphic, having an average diameter of 120 nm, and length of the surface spikes of 20 nm. The second type was pleomorphic with length of the spikes of 11 nm. Most of the fecal samples, containing corona viruses, agglutinate mice, rat and hamster erythrocytes.

With the hemagglutination-inhibition test developed, antibodies against corona-viruses in the sera of a considerable number of the cows have been demonstrated. A precipitating antigen has been shown in a part of the fecal samples, containing rota-viruses. By studying the physical and chemical properties, its gradient density and its comparison with a refernce antigen, it has been shown that the antigen was conditioned by degraded fragments of rota-viruses.

This study aimed to evaluate the capacity of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO)-almitrine combination to restore oxygenation in severe COVID-19 ARDS (C-ARDS) patients. METHODS: We conducted a monocentric preliminary pilot study in intubated patients with severe C-ARDS. Respiratory mechanics was assessed after a prone session. Then, patients received iNO (10 ppm) alone and in association with almitrine (10 µg/kg/min) during 30 min in each step. Echocardiographic and blood gases measurements were performed at baseline, during iNO alone, and iNO-almitrine combination. The primary endpoint was the variation of oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2 ratio). RESULTS: Ten severe C-ARDS patients were assessed (7 males and 3 females), with a median age of 60 [52-72] years. Combination of iNO and almitrine outperformed iNO alone for oxygenation improvement. The median of PaO2/FiO2 ratio varied from 102 [89-134] mmHg at baseline, to 124 [108-146] mmHg after iNO (p = 0.13) and 180 [132-206] mmHg after iNO and almitrine (p < 0.01). We found no correlation between the increase in oxygenation caused by iNO-almitrine combination and that caused by proning. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study of severe C-ARDS patients, iNO-almitrine combination was associated with rapid and significant improvement of oxygenation. These findings highlight the role of pulmonary vascular function in COVID-19 pathophysiology.","Bagate, François; Tuffet, Samuel; Masi, Paul; Perier, François; Razazi, Keyvan; de Prost, Nicolas; Carteaux, Guillaume; Payen, Didier; Mekontso Dessap, Armand",Ann Intensive Care,84,26

This so-called reproduction number has significant implications for the disease progression. There has been increasing literature suggesting that superspreading, the significant variability in number of new infections caused by individuals, plays an important role in the spread of COVID-19. In this paper, we consider the effect that such superspreading has on the estimation of the reproduction number and subsequent estimates of future cases. Accordingly, we employ a simple extension to models currently used in the literature to estimate the reproduction number and present a case-study of the progression of COVID-19 in Austria. Our models demonstrate that the estimation uncertainty of the reproduction number increases with superspreading and that this improves the performance of prediction intervals. In a simplified model, we derive a transparent formula that connects the extent of superspreading to the width of credible intervals for the reproduction number.","Johnson, Kory D.; Beiglbock, Mathias; Eder, Manuel; Grass, Annemarie; Hermisson, Joachim; Pammer, Gudmund; Polechov'a, Jitka; Toneian, Daniel; Wolfl, Benjamin",,84,21

Exposure to contaminated surfaces is one of the main routes of respiratory diseases transmission. Therefore, it is very important for epidemic prevention and control to study the law of virus decay and the environmental coupling effect on various surfaces. Based on the analysis of the influencing mechanism, a large amount of experimental evidence on the survival of viruses on the surface of objects were excavated in this paper, and the effects of various factors, such as surface peripheral temperature, relative humidity, virus-containing droplet volume, surface materials and virus types, on the decay rate constants of viruses were comprehensively analyzed. It was found that although the experimental methods, virus types and experimental conditions varied widely in different experiments, the virus concentrations on the surface of objects all followed the exponential decay law, and the coupling effect of various factors was reflected in the decay rate constant k. Under different experimental conditions, k values ranged from 0.001 to 100 h-1, with a difference of 5 orders of magnitude, corresponding to the characteristic time t99 between 500 and 0.1 h when the virus concentration decreased by 99%. This indicates a large variation in the risk of virus transmission in different scenarios. By revealing the common law and individuality of the virus decay on the surface of objects, the essential relationship between the experimental observation phenomenon and virus decay was analyzed. This paper points out the huge difference in virus transmission risk on the surface at different time nodes, and discusses the prevention and control strategies to grasp the main contradictions in the different situations.","Guo, Luyao; Yang, Zhao; Guo, Lei; Chen, Linlin; Cheng, Zhu; Zhang, Li; Long, Enshen",Environ Res,84,24

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in a maternity unity of a public teaching hospital which was not part of the reference service for COVID-19 treatment. It compared PPEP consumption and the occurrence of SSI after cesarean sections in monthly periods before and after the occurrence of the first case of COVID-19 in Porto Alegre, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Personal protective equipment and products consumption was measured as units of masks, gloves, gowns, and caps, and use of alcohol-based products or soap for hand sanitation as ml/patient/day. The SSI index was calculated as the proportion of cases of SSI over the number of cesarean sections performed monthly during the study period. RESULTS: There was an increase in all measured items of PPEP, with consumption of disposable masks with a median of 1,450 units in the pre-COVID period, and of 2550 in the post-COVID period (a 75.9% increase). A decrease of 49% in SSI was detected, with a median of 1.74 in the pre-COVID period and of 0.89 in the post-COVID period. CONCLUSION: The increase in consumption of PPEP could be a result of safer practices adopted by healthcare workers with the advent of COVID-19, of which the following reduction in the occurrence of SSI could be a direct consequence. Despite the severity of the crisis, one could state that extreme situations can lead to valuable reflections and opportunities for improvement.","Antonello, Vicente Sperb; Dallé, Jessica; Antonello, Ivan Carlos Ferreira; Benzano, Daniela; Ramos, Mauro Cunha",Rev Bras Ginecol Obstet,84,12

BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 crisis, nurses experience a greater psychological burden than other health care workers. Studies have not yet investigated the effects of years in nursing and mental health on potential work impairment during the COVID-19 crisis in nurses. METHODS: A survey was administered to 83 nurses on active duty during the COVID-19 crisis. The graphical LASSO and the DAG helped estimate the associations between years of nursing experience, mental health and work impairment. RESULTS: A moderate negative correlation emerged between years of nursing experience, avoidance and work impairment. A direct effect was observed between anxiety and work impairment. A moderate positive correlation emerged between anxiety, depression and work impairment. An indirect effect was observed between depression, burnout, insomnia, years of nursing experience and work impairment. CONCLUSIONS: In the present sample, nurses' work impairment decreased with greater years of nursing experience and increased with higher anxiety, depression, burnout and avoidance levels. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: These findings can help design effective infectious disease management programmes for students and professionals in nursing to prevent breakdowns and avoid work impairment.","Tokac, Umit; Razon, Selen",J. nurs. manag,84,1

The cross-sectional study was conducted online from August 28 to September 4, 2020, among 426 parents who had at least one child aged 5 to 15 years. Moreover, K-means clustering was used to group 4 categories based on mental health disturbances, and confirmation factors analysis was performed to identify the relationship between parenting behaviour and children's mental health, then assessed by the chi-square test. Children were divided into four groups, in which 52% had subthreshold mental disorders (mean Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)-10;2.45), 32% had a mild (mean MDD-10;5.31), 13% had a moderate (mean MDD-10;12.5), and 3% of the children had severe (mean MDD-10;15.3). The percentage of mental disorders in children is higher in children with a higher educational level of the parents, families contracted COVID-19 and abnormal behaviour of the parents.

Although there are a large number of candidate drug compounds that may be useful for treating COVID-19, the evaluation of these drugs is time-consuming and costly. Thus, screening to identify potentially effective drugs prior to experimental validation is necessary. METHOD: In this study, we applied the recently proposed method tensor decomposition (TD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) to gene expression profiles of multiple lung cancer cell lines infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. We identified drug candidate compounds that significantly altered the expression of the 163 genes selected by TD-based unsupervised FE. RESULTS: Numerous drugs were successfully screened, including many known antiviral drug compounds such as C646, chelerythrine chloride, canertinib, BX-795, sorafenib, sorafenib, QL-X-138, radicicol, A-443654, CGP-60474, alvocidib, mitoxantrone, QL-XII-47, geldanamycin, fluticasone, atorvastatin, quercetin, motexafin gadolinium, trovafloxacin, doxycycline, meloxicam, gentamicin, and dibromochloromethane. The screen also identified ivermectin, which was first identified as an anti-parasite drug and recently the drug was included in clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of data on 202 SOTR with COVID-19, published as case reports or case series. We extracted clinical, hemato-chemical, imaging, treatment, and outcome data. RESULTS: Most patients were kidney recipients (61.9%), males (68.8%), with median age of 57 years. The majority was on tacrolimus (73.5%) and mycophenolate (65.8%). Mortality was 18.8%, but an equal proportion was still hospitalized at last follow up. Immune suppressive therapy was withheld in 77.2% of patients, either partially or completely. Tacrolimus was continued in 50%. One third of survivors that continued immunosuppressants were on dual therapy plus steroids. None of those who continued immunosuppressants developed critical COVID-19 disease. Age (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1-1.11, P = .001) and lopinavir/ritonavir use (OR 3.3, 95%CI 1.2-8.5, P = .013) were independent predictors of mortality while immunosuppression maintenance (OR 0.067, 95% CI 0.008-0.558, P = .012) and tacrolimus continuation (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.7, P = .013) were independent predictors of survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that maintaining immune suppression might be safe in SOTR with moderate and severe COVID-19. Specifically, receiving tacrolimus could be beneficial for COVID-19 SOTR. Because of the quality of the available evidence, no definitive guidance on how to manage SOTR with COVID-19 can be derived from our data.","Karruli, Arta; Spiezia, Serenella; Boccia, Filomena; Gagliardi, Massimo; Patauner, Fabian; Salemme, Anna; Maiello, Ciro; Zampino, Rosa; Durante-Mangoni, Emanuele",Transpl Infect Dis,84,27

Nintedanib is a new antifibrotic agent that interferes with processes of pulmonary fibrosis. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib in COVID-19. METHODS: This was an interventional study in which adult patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) were consecutively enrolled. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality after the initiation of MV. The secondary endpoints were length of MV, volume of lung injury, and the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events and acute liver failure. RESULTS: Thirty patients with COVID-19 underwent nintedanib therapy. We included 30 patients not receiving nintedanib as the historical control group. There were no significant differences in 28-day mortality between the groups (23.3% vs 20%, p = 0.834). Lengths of MV were significantly shorter in the nintedanib group (p = 0.046).

The present study aimed to explore the association of excess mortality with some indices related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its management. METHODS: Data on all-cause mortality from 20 February-31 March in the years 2015-2020, and demographic, socioeconomic and healthcare organisation data of each Italian region were obtained from the Italian Institute of Statistics. Non-COVID-19-Imputed Excess Mortality (NCIEM) was calculated as the difference between the excess 2020 mortality and reported COVID-19 mortality. The association of NCIEM with the rate of COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 mortality and other potential moderators was assessed using linear regression models. RESULTS: The nationwide number of excess deaths and COVID-19 deaths was 26,701 and 13,710, respectively, with a difference of 12,991. The NCIEM in different regions showed a direct correlation with COVID-19 mortality (r2 = 0.61, p < 0.001) and total cases (r2 = 0.30, p = 0.012), and an inverse correlation with cases/total tests ratio (r2 = 0.49, p = 0.001). Direct correlations were also found with the proportion of institutionalised elderly, whereas inverse correlations were observed with prevalence of diabetes, cardiovascular mortality and density of general practitioners. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all-cause mortality was considerably greater than that indicated by official counts of victims. Limited testing capacity and causes of death other than COVID-19 could have contributed to the increase in overall mortality rates.","Mannucci, Edoardo; Nreu, Besmir; Monami, Matteo",Int J Infect Dis,84,20

Currently, RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus is mainly detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based nucleic acid assays, while SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody are identified by immunological assays. Both nucleic acid assays and immunological assays rely on the luminescence signals of specific luminescence probes for qualitative and quantitative detection. The exploration of novel luminescence probes will play a crucial role in improving the detection sensitivity of the assays. As innate probes, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) exhibit negligible luminescence in the free state but enhanced luminescence in the aggregated or restricted states. Moreover, AIEgen-based nanoparticles (AIE dots) offer efficient luminescence, good biocompatibility and water solubility, and superior photostability. Both AIEgens and AIE dots have been widely used for high-performance detection of biomolecules and small molecules, chemical/biological imaging, and medical therapeutics. In this review, the availability of AIEgens and AIE dots in nucleic acid assays and immunological assays are enumerated and discussed. By building a bridge between AIE materials and COVID-19, we hope to inspire researchers to use AIE materials as a powerful weapon against COVID-19.","Liu, Zongwei; Meng, Ting; Tang, Xiaofang; Tian, Ran; Guan, Weijiang",Front Immunol,84,1

These methods have also been used to predict gene mutations from pathology images, but no comprehensive evaluation of their potential for extracting molecular features from histology slides has yet been performed. We show that HE2RNA, a model based on the integration of multiple data modes, can be trained to systematically predict RNA-Seq profiles from whole-slide images alone, without expert annotation. Through its interpretable design, HE2RNA provides virtual spatialization of gene expression, as validated by CD3- and CD20-staining on an independent dataset. The transcriptomic representation learned by HE2RNA can also be transferred on other datasets, even of small size, to increase prediction performance for specific molecular phenotypes.

This captures, for example, constraints arising from social distancing guidelines. While it is sometimes impossible to allocate a proportional share to every agent under the separation requirement, we show that the well-known criterion of maximin share fairness can always be attained. We then establish several computational properties of maximin share fairness -- for instance, the maximin share of an agent cannot be computed exactly by any finite algorithm, but can be approximated with an arbitrarily small error. In addition, we consider the division of a pie (i.e., a circular cake) and show that an ordinal relaxation of maximin share fairness can be achieved.","Elkind, Edith; Segal-Halevi, Erel; Suksompong, Warut",,84,6

METHODS: An online survey of women having health care appointments in the outpatient facilities across all divisions of a Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at a tertiary care referral center in North Central Florida. Patients had outpatient appointments that were scheduled, canceled or rescheduled, in person or by telemedicine, between 11 March 2020 and 11 May 2020, a time during which a COVID-19 stay-at-home order was enacted across our state. A total of 6,697 visits were planned. Patients with multiple visits were unified, leaving 6,044 unique patients to whom the survey was emailed between 20 July 2020 and 31 July 2020. The survey was closed on 21 August 2020. Analyses were focused on simple descriptive statistics to assess frequency of responses. Analyses of variance and chi-square analyses were conducted to compare outcomes when all cells were &#8805; 10, based on sub-specialty and insurance status; otherwise, frequencies were examined for the entire sample only. Missing data were excluded listwise. RESULTS: A total of 6044 patients were contacted. Completed surveys numbered 1,083 yielding a response rate of 17.9%. The most common sub-specialty visit was gynecology (56.7%) followed by obstetrics (31.5%,), pelvic floor disorders (4.8%), gynecological oncology (2.9%,), and reproductive endocrinology (0.5%). A substantial percentage of women had visits canceled (19.2%), rescheduled (32.8%) or changed (42.1%) to telemedicine. In our patient population, 32.6% were worried about visiting the clinic and 48.1% were worried about visiting the hospital. COVID-19 triggered changes were perceived to have a negative impact by 26.1% of respondents. Refusal of future telemedicine visits was by 17.2%, however, 75.2% would prefer to use both in-person and telemedicine visits. CONCLUSION: During the initial COVID-19 surge with lockdown, the majority of survey respondents were following public health precautions. However, there were significant concerns amongst women related to obstetric and gynecologic medical appointments scheduled during that period. During pandemics, natural disasters and similar extreme circumstances, digital communication and telemedicine have the potential to play a critical role in providing reassurance and care. Nevertheless, given the concerns expressed by survey respondents, communication and messaging tools are needed to increase comfort and ensure equity with the rapidly changing methods of care delivery.","Abu-Rustum, Reem S; Bright, Melissa; Moawad, Nash; Weber LeBrun, Emily; Roussos-Ross, Kay; Christman, Gregory; Rhoton-Vlasak, Alice; Smulian, John C",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,84,16

However, during social interactions, as in any dynamical system, patterns of coordination form and dissipate at different scales. Historically, researchers have used aggregate measures to capture coordination over time. While those measures (e.g., mean relative phase, cross-correlation, coherence) have provided a wealth of information about coordination in social settings, some evidence suggests that multiscale coordination may change over the time course of a typical empirical observation. To address this gap, we demonstrate an underutilized method, windowed multiscale synchrony, that moves beyond quantifying aggregate measures of coordination by focusing on how the relative strength of coordination changes over time and the scales that comprise social interaction. This method involves using a wavelet transform to decompose time series into component frequencies (i.e., scales), preserving temporal information and then quantifying phase synchronization at each of these scales. We apply this method to both simulated and empirical interpersonal physiological and neuromechanical data. We anticipate that demonstrating this method will stimulate new insights on the mechanisms and functions of synchrony in interpersonal contexts using neurophysiological and behavioral measures.","Aaron, D Likens; Travis, J Wiltshire",Social cognitive and affective neuroscience,84,30

Serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) may quantify the rate of clinically significant exposure in an institutional setting and identify those HCWs who are at greatest risk. METHODS: We conducted a survey and SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing among a convenience sample of HCWs from 79 non-COVID and 3 dedicated COVID hospitals in District Srinagar of Kashmir, India. In addition to testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), we collected information on demographics, occupational group, influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms, nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing status, history of close unprotected contacts, and quarantine/travel history. RESULTS: Of 7,346 eligible HCWs, 2,915 (39.7%) participated in the study. The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies was 2.5% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.1%), while HCWs who had ever worked at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital had a substantially lower seroprevalence of 0.6% (95% CI, 0.2%-1.9%). Higher seroprevalence rates were observed among HCWs who reported a recent ILI (12.2%), a positive RT-PCR (27.6%), a history of being put under quarantine (4.9%), and a history of close unprotected contact with a person with COVID-19 (4.4%). Healthcare workers who ever worked at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital had a lower multivariate-adjusted risk of seropositivity (odds ratio, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06-0.66). CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation suggests that infection-control practices, including a compliance-maximizing buddy system, are valuable and effective in preventing infection within a high-risk clinical setting. Universal masking, mandatory testing of patients, and residential dormitories for HCWs at COVID-19-dedicated hospitals is an effective multifaceted approach to infection control. Moreover, given that many infections among HCWs are community-acquired, it is likely that the vigilant practices in these hospitals will have spillover effects, creating ingrained behaviors that will continue outside the hospital setting.","Khan, Muhammad Salim; Haq, Inaamul; Qurieshi, Mariya Amin; Majid, Sabhiya; Bhat, Arif Akbar; Qazi, Tanzeela Bashir; Chowdri, Iqra Nisar; Sabah, Iram; Kawoosa, Misbah Ferooz; Lone, Abdul Aziz; Nabi, Shahroz; Sumji, Ishtiyaq Ahmad; Obaid, Muhammad; Kousar, Rafiya",J Hosp Med,84,1

The highly contagious nature of this virus makes it imperative for us to identify promising inhibitors from pre-existing antiviral drugs. Two druggable targets, namely 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) and 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase (2'-O-MTase) were selected in this study due to their indispensable nature in the viral life cycle. 3CLpro is a cysteine protease responsible for the proteolysis of replicase polyproteins resulting in the formation of various functional proteins, whereas 2'-O-MTase methylates the ribose 2'-O position of the first and second nucleotide of viral mRNA, which sequesters it from the host immune system. The selected drug target proteins were screened against an in-house library of 123 antiviral drugs. Two promising drug molecules were identified for each protein based on their estimated free energy of binding (&#916;G), the orientation of drug molecules in the active site and the interacting residues. The selected protein-drug complexes were then subjected to MD simulation, which consists of various structural parameters to equivalently reflect their physiological state. From the virtual screening results, two drug molecules were selected for each drug target protein [Paritaprevir (&#916;G = -9.8 kcal/mol) & Raltegravir (&#916;G = -7.8 kcal/mol) for 3CLpro and Dolutegravir (&#916;G = -9.4 kcal/mol) and Bictegravir (&#916;G = -8.4 kcal/mol) for 2'-OMTase].

Thus, there is an urgent need to interpret the available literature in order to establish safe practices for dental professionals as well as limit the spread of infection through saliva. The study intends to provide up-to-date, compiled evidence-based information related to saliva and its association with COVID-19. It further provides suggestions for safe practices in dentistry in current pandemic times. Oral symptoms may be strongly suggestive of early diagnosis and disease progression in COVID-19 patients. Viral loads in saliva are reported higher than standard nasopharyngeal swabs in few studies, majorly in the 1stweek of symptom onset. Besides, salivary diagnostics has many additional advantages of being noninvasive, comfortable to the patients with the possibility of point-of-care testing for diagnosing COVID-19. High-efficiency particulate arrestor filter, rubber dam application and high-volume evacuator can reduce spatter and droplets/aerosol production. Povidone-iodine-based mouthwash maybe mouthwash of choice before any dental examination or procedures due to its ability to decrease severe acute respiratory syndrome- coronavirus 2 viral loads in the mouth.

The feasibility and safety of surfactant delivery in COVID-19 ARDS patients have not been established. METHODS: We performed retrospective analyses of data from patients receiving off-label use of exogenous natural surfactant during the COVID-19 pandemic. Seven COVID-19 PCR positive ARDS patients received liquid Curosurf (720 mg) in 150 ml normal saline, divided into five 30 ml aliquots) and delivered via a bronchoscope into second-generation bronchi. Patients were matched with 14 comparable subjects receiving supportive care for ARDS during the same time period. Feasibility and safety were examined as well as the duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality. RESULTS: Patients showed no evidence of acute decompensation following surfactant installation into minor bronchi. Cox regression showed a reduction of 28-days mortality within the surfactant group, though not significant. The surfactant did not increase the duration of ventilation, and health care providers did not convert to COVID-19 positive. CONCLUSIONS: Surfactant delivery through bronchoscopy at a dose of 720 mg in 150 ml normal saline is feasible and safe for COVID-19 ARDS patients and health care providers during the pandemic. Surfactant administration did not cause acute decompensation, may reduce mortality and mechanical ventilation duration in COVID-19 ARDS patients.

It is important to diagnose the disease in the early stages. Current methods detect the disease with low specificity. Examining the expression of genes responsible for disease and their epigenetic regulators are good tools in this regard. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective case-control study, 40 Iranian patients with cancer, 40 Iranian patients with prostate hyperplasia, and 40 control samples were examined. After blood sampling from each individual, RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, GSTP1, HDAC, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B expressions were measured in three understudy groups using specific primers and Real-Time PCR method. RESULTS: A reverse correlation was identified between loss of GSTP1 expression and overexpression of HDAC, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B (P value < 0.0001) with a beneficial pattern of cancer development with high efficiency. The significant decrease of GSTP1 expression in patients in comparison to the healthy controls and the elevated expression levels of the studied epigenetic regulators in PCA and BPH samples indicate the impact of the regulators on GSTP1 expression activity. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the measurement of combined GSTP1 and its epigenetic regulators' expression could be used as suitable genetic markers for the detection and separation of healthy individuals from prostatic patient groups in the Iranian population. However, a similar study in a larger population of case and control could help us to distinguish between normal, benign, and malignant conditions.","Mohammadi, Mahan; Irani, Shiva; Salahshourifar, Iman; Hosseini, Jalil; Moradi, Afshin; Pouresmaeili, Farkhondeh",Hum. antibodies,84,16

In 98 cases lobectomies were performed for malignant lesions, while in 9 cases for benign changes. 78 men and 34 women were operated on. The average age was 60.5 years (42-63). In 5 cases the left upper lobes were resected, in cases 36 the left lower lobes, in 15 cases the right upper lobes, in 11 cases the mid lobes, in 44 cases the right lower lobes, and in one case pneumonectomy was performed. RESULTS: there was no postoperative mortality. Conversion was required in three 3 patients. The average time of surgery was 150 minutes (70-215). Re-operation was needed in two cases due to bleeding and air leakage. Out of the 112 operations, primary lung cancer was demonstrated on pathology in 88 cases, while benign lesions /inflammation in 9 cases. The stages of primary lung cancer were the following: I.a:57, I.b:22, II.a:6, II.b:3 patients. Tumour subtypes were the detailed as 52 adenocarcinoma, 23 squamous cell cc., 2 small cell cc., 5 large cell cc., and 6 carcinoid. 10 patients underwent VATS lobectomy for metastatic disease.

There are limited data on how such social determinants of health, including neighborhood socioeconomic conditions, affect the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine how social determinants of health are associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 illness in hospitalized pregnant patients in New York during the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study evaluated all pregnant patients who delivered and had polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between March 15, 2020, and June 15, 2020, at 7 hospitals within Northwell Health, the largest academic health system in New York. During the study period, universal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing protocols were implemented at all sites. Polymerase chain reaction testing was performed using nasopharyngeal swabs. Patients were excluded if the following variables were not available: polymerase chain reaction results, race, ethnicity, or zone improvement plan (ZIP) code of residence. Clinical data were obtained from the enterprise electronic health record system. For each patient, ZIP code was used as a proxy for neighborhood. Socioeconomic characteristics were determined by linking to ZIP code data from the United States Census Bureau's American Community Survey and the Internal Revenue Service's Statistics of Income Division. Specific variables of interest included mean persons per household, median household income, percent unemployment, and percent with less than high school education. Medical records were manually reviewed for all subjects with positive polymerase chain reaction test results to correctly identify symptomatic patients and then classify those subjects using the National Institutes of Health severity of illness categories. Classification was based on the highest severity of illness throughout gestation and not necessarily at the time of presentation for delivery. RESULTS: A total of 4873 patients were included in the study. The polymerase chain reaction test positivity rate was 11% (n=544). Among this group, 359 patients (66%) were asymptomatic or presymptomatic, 115 (21%) had mild or moderate coronavirus disease 2019, and 70 (13%) had severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019. On multiple logistic regression modeling, pregnant patients who had a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were more likely to be younger or of higher parity, belong to minoritized racial and ethnic groups, have public health insurance, have limited English proficiency, and reside in low-income neighborhoods with less educational attainment. On ordinal logit regression modeling, obesity, income and education were associated with coronavirus disease 2019 severity. CONCLUSION: Social and physical determinants of health play a role in determining the risk of infection. The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 illness was not associated with race or ethnicity but was associated with maternal obesity and neighborhood level characteristics such as educational attainment and household income.","Prasannan, Lakha; Rochelson, Burton; Shan, Weiwei; Nicholson, Kaitlin; Solmonovich, Rachel; Kulkarni, Aparna; Lewis, Dawnette; Greenberg, Meir; Nimaroff, Michael; Blitz, Matthew J",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,84,16

The relationship between substance use and mental health has been extensively studied, with one possible relationship being substance misuse causes poor mental health. However, the lack of evidence on the relationship has resulted in opioids being largely inaccessible through legal means. This study analyzes the substance misuse posts on social media with the opioids being sold through crypto market listings. We use the Drug Abuse Ontology, state-of-the-art deep learning, and BERT-based models to generate sentiment and emotion for the social media posts to understand user perception on social media by investigating questions such as, which synthetic opioids people are optimistic, neutral, or negative about or what kind of drugs induced fear and sorrow or what kind of drugs people love or thankful about or which drug people think negatively about or which opioids cause little to no sentimental reaction. We also perform topic analysis associated with the generated sentiments and emotions to understand which topics correlate with people's responses to various drugs. Our findings can help shape policy to help isolate opioid use cases where timely intervention may be required to prevent adverse consequences, prevent overdose-related deaths, and worsen the epidemic.","Lokala, Usha; Lamy, Francois; Dastidar, Triyasha Ghosh; Roy, Kaushik; Daniulaityte, Raminta; Parthasarathy, Srinivasan; Sheth, Amit",,84,1

We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Canadian setting. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case series of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection consecutively admitted to 1 of 6 ICUs in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, between Feb. 21 and Apr. 14, 2020. Demographic, management and outcome data were collected by review of patient charts and electronic medical records. RESULTS: Between Feb. 21 and Apr. 14, 2020, 117 patients were admitted to the ICU with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The median age was 69 (interquartile range [IQR] 60-75) years, and 38 (32.5%) were female. At least 1 comorbidity was present in 86 (73.5%) patients. Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 74 (63.2%) patients. The duration of mechanical ventilation was 13.5 (IQR 8-22) days overall and 11 (IQR 6-16) days for patients successfully discharged from the ICU. Tocilizumab was administered to 4 patients and hydroxychloroquine to 1 patient. As of May 5, 2020, a total of 18 (15.4%) patients had died, 12 (10.3%) remained in the ICU, 16 (13.7%) were discharged from the ICU but remained in hospital, and 71 (60.7%) were discharged home.

For students, one of the challenges is managing the sheer volume of such video material as video presentations of taught material are difficult to abbreviate and summarise because they do not have highlights which stand out. Apart from video bookmarks there are no tools available to determine which parts of video content should be replayed at revision time or just before examinations. We have developed and deployed a digital library for managing video learning material which has many dozens of hours of short-form video content from a range of taught courses for hundreds of students at undergraduate level. Through a web browser we allow students to access and play these videos and we log their anonymised playback usage. From these logs we score to each segment of each video based on the amount of playback it receives from across all students, whether the segment has been re-wound and re-played in the same student session, whether the on-screen window is the window in focus on the student's desktop/laptop, and speed of playback. We also incorporate negative scoring if a video segment is skipped or fast-forward, and overarching all this we include a decay function based on recency of playback, so the most recent days of playback contribute more to the video segment scores. For each video in the library we present a usage-based graph which allows students to see which parts of each video attract the most playback from their peers, which helps them select material at revision time. Usage of the system is fully anonymised and GDPR-compliant.","Lee, Hyowon; Liu, Mingming; Scriney, Michael; Smeaton, Alan F.",,84,2

Grief is a natural consequence. Many mental health concerns, which can be identified as grief outcomes (e.g. anxiety and depression) in those who have experienced a bereavement, can be improved through physical activity. The objective of this review was to identify from the existing literature if physical activity can benefit grief outcomes in individuals who have been bereaved. METHODS: A systematic review of nine databases was performed. Included studies (qualitative and quantitative) explored physical activity to help individuals (of any age) who had experienced a human bereavement (excluding national loss). RESULTS: From 1299 studies screened, 25 met the inclusion criteria, detailing eight types of bereavement (parental (n = 5), spousal (n = 6), patient (n = 4), pre-natal (n = 3), later life (n = 1), caregiver (n = 1), multiple (n = 4) and non-defined (n = 1). Activities including yoga, running, walking and martial arts were noted as beneficial. Physical activity allowed a sense of freedom, to express emotions, provided a distraction and an escape from grief, whilst enhancing social support. CONCLUSION: There is some evidence that physical activity may provide benefit for the physical health and psychological wellbeing of those who have been bereaved, including when the loss has happened at a young age. This review is timely, given the wide-scale national loss of life due to COVID-19 and extends knowledge in this area. More research is needed to explore the benefits of physical activity for those who have been bereaved. In particular, there is a need for well-designed interventions which are tailored to specific activities, populations and grief outcomes.","Williams, Jane; Shorter, Gillian W; Howlett, Neil; Zakrzewski-Fruer, Julia; Chater, Angel M",Sports Med Open,84,26

Anti-spike monoclonal antibodies, including bamlanivimab, have demonstrated reduction in hospitalization rates in clinical trials, yet real-world evidence is lacking. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study across a single healthcare system of non-hospitalized patients, age 18 years or older, with documented positive SARS-CoV-2 testing, risk factors for severe COVID-19, and referrals for bamlanivimab via emergency use authorization. Cases were defined as patients who received bamlanivimab; contemporary controls had a referral order placed but did not receive bamlanivimab. The primary outcome was 30-day hospitalization rate from initial positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Descriptive statistics, including Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U test, were performed. Multivariable logistic regression was used for adjusted analysis to evaluate independent associations with 30-day hospitalization. RESULTS: Between November 20, 2020 and January 19, 2021, 218 patients received bamlanivimab (cases) and 185 were referred but did not receive drug (controls). Thirty-day hospitalization rate was significantly lower among patients who received bamlanivimab (7.3% v 20.0%, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21-0.64, p<0.001), and the number needed to treat was 8. On logistic regression, odds of hospitalization were increased in patients not receiving bamlanivimab and with a higher number of pre-specified comorbidities (OR 4.19 CI: 1.31-2.16, p<0.001; OR 1.68, CI: 2.12-8.30, p<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Ambulatory patients with COVID-19 who received bamlanivimab had a lower 30-day hospitalization than control patients in real-world experience. We identified receipt of bamlanivimab and fewer comorbidities as protective factors against hospitalization.","Kumar, Rebecca N; Wu, En-Ling; Stosor, Valentina; Moore, William J; Achenbach, Chad; Ison, Michael G; Angarone, Michael P",Clin. infect. dis,84,14

Their impact in liver surgery is poorly understood and approach-specific ERPs have not yet been assessed. This retrospective study aims to analyse the effect of such programs on liver resection. All patients undergoing liver resection at a tertiary referral centre between January 2009 and April 2019 were identified. Primary outcome was the length of stay (LOS), secondary outcomes were functional recovery, complications and readmission rates. Patients in the ERP with different protocols for open, laparoscopic, major and minor resections were compared to a historical cohort. Of 1056 patients, 644 were treated within the ERP. A comparable duration of hospital stay [7 days (IQR (interquartile range) 6-12) vs 7 days (IQR 5-9) p = 0.047] and faster functional recovery with fewer complications was found in the ERP group [94 (50.5%) vs 103 (35.9%) p < 0.002]. Those advantages were smaller after open minor compared to open major resection. In patients undergoing laparoscopic resection no differences were observed except for a lower readmission rate [21 (9.3%) vs 13 (3.6%) p = 0.005]. Multivariable analysis showed that laparoscopy was associated with a shorter LOS. ERPs offer significant advantages in open liver surgery. Those advantages are less evident after laparoscopic resection.","Giovinazzo, Francesco; Kuemmerli, Christoph; Moekotte, Alma; Rawashdeh, Arab; Suhool, Amal; Armstrong, Thomas; Primrose, John; Abu Hilal, Mohammed",Updates surg.

Here, we analyze the prevalence and diffusion of links to low-credibility content about the pandemic across two major social media platforms, Twitter and Facebook. We characterize cross-platform similarities and differences in popular sources, diffusion patterns, influencers, coordination, and automation. Comparing the two platforms, we find divergence among the prevalence of popular low-credibility sources and suspicious videos. A minority of accounts and pages exert a strong influence on each platform. These misinformation “superspreaders” are often associated with the low-credibility sources and tend to be verified by the platforms. On both platforms, there is evidence of coordinated sharing of Infodemic content. The overt nature of this manipulation points to the need for societal-level solutions in addition to mitigation strategies within the platforms.

However, it remains unclear which individuals are most susceptible. Electrocortical markers of reward processing, such as the reward positivity (RewP), are implicated in depression risk and may provide insights into who is most vulnerable to stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study examined whether pre-pandemic neural correlates of reward reactivity (i.e., RewP) moderated the impact of social and financial stress on changes in youth and mother depression symptoms pre-to-post pandemic onset. Youth (n = 45) and mothers (n = 45) in the current sample were recruited prior to the COVID-19 pandemic as part of a larger study. RewP was assessed pre-pandemic, and depression symptoms were assessed pre- and post-pandemic onset for both youth and mothers. Additionally, social and financial chronic stress severity was assessed post-pandemic onset using a modified version of the UCLA Life Stress Interview. Financial stress was associated with prospective increases in depression for youth exhibiting blunted RewP at baseline. Similarly, family stress was associated with prospective increases in depression symptoms for mothers exhibiting blunted RewP at baseline. Findings suggest reduced reward responsiveness at the neural level may predispose both youth and mothers to future depression symptoms when exposed to higher levels of stress in the context of a pandemic.","Feurer, Cope; Granros, Maria; Calentino, Alison E; Suor, Jennifer H; Patel, Khushboo; Burkhouse, Katie L",J Psychiatr Res,84,16

It is only effective if there is a large user base, which brings new challenges like app users unfamiliar with using smartphones or apps. As Corona-Warn-App is voluntary to use, reaching many users and gaining a positive public perception is crucial for its effectiveness. Based on app reviews and tweets, we are analyzing the public perception of Corona-Warn-App. We collected and analyzed all 78,963 app reviews for the Android and iOS versions from release (June 2020) to beginning of February 2021, as well as all original tweets until February 2021 containing #CoronaWarnApp (43,082). For the reviews, the most common words and n-grams point towards technical issues, but it remains unclear, to what extent this is due to the app itself, the used Exposure Notification Framework, system settings on the user's phone, or the user's misinterpretations of app content. For Twitter data, overall, based on tweet content, frequent hashtags, and interactions with tweets, we conclude that the German Twitter-sphere widely reports adopting the app and promotes its use.","Beierle, Felix; Dhakal, Uttam; Cohrdes, Caroline; Eicher, Sophie; Pryss, Rudiger",,84,16

We aimed to: (1) identify and assess the quality of information that commercial manufacturers provided for their point-of-care tests (POCTs) and (2) examine the implications of these findings on real-world settings. DESIGN: We used a content analysis methodology in two stages to systematically, code and analyse textual data from documents of commercial manufacturers. A deductive approach was applied using a coding guide based on the validated Point-of-Care Key Evidence Tool (POCKET) multidimensional checklist. An inductive approach was used to identify new patterns or themes generated from our textual analysis. SETTING: Publicly available supportive information documents by commercial manufacturers for lateral flow serology, were identified and gathered from online searches. PARTICIPANTS: Supportive information documents retrieved from online searches over 3 months (March 2020 to June 2020). RESULTS: A total of 79 POCTs were identified that met the study inclusion criteria. Using the POCKET coding guide, we found that the quality of information varied significantly between the manufacturers and was often lacking in detail. Our inductive approach further examined these topics and found that several statements were vague and that significant variations in the level of details existed between manufacturers. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed significant concerns surrounding the supportive information reported by manufacturers for lateral flow serology assays. Information transparency was poor and human factor issues were not properly addressed to mitigate the risk of improper device use, although it should be noted that the results of our study are limited by the data that manufactures were prepared to disclose. Overall, commercial manufacturers should improve the quality and value of information presented in their supporting documentation.","Kierkegaard, Patrick; McLister, Anna; Buckle, Peter",BMJ Open,84,24

Advance care planning in its traditional manner may be difficult to achieve given the unpredictability of the disease trajectory. Despite this, it is crucial that patients' care wishes are explored as this will help prevent inappropriate admissions to hospital and to critical care, improve symptom control and advocate for patient choice. This article provides practical tips on how to translate decisions around treatment escalation plans into conversations, both face-to-face and over the phone, in a sensitive and compassionate manner. Care planning conversations for patients with COVID-19 should be individualised and actively involve the patient. Focusing on goals of care rather than ceilings of treatment can help to alleviate anxiety around these conversations and will remind patients that their care will never cease. Using a framework such as the 'SPIKES' mnemonic can help to structure this conversation. Verbally conveying empathy will be key, particularly when wearing personal protective equipment or speaking to relatives over the phone. It is also important to make time to recognise your own emotions during and/or after these conversations.","Palipane, Natasha; Ponnampalampillai, Abi; Gupta, Srirupa",Br J Hosp Med (Lond),84,27

Results: Patients were contacted on average 6.3 hours after their results became available. There was a total of 138 ED visits. Of these, 40% were admitted to the hospital, with 36% of those admitted requiring ICU level of care. Of the 849 patients in this sample, there were only 2 deaths (0.23%) at 60 days. Conclusion: Our innovative multidisciplinary COVID team provided excellent clinical care for patients with COVID with a very low mortality rate compared to the national average. While data is not available on a national scale for time to contact patient, our team was able to contact patients within the established recommendation for contact within 48 hours of testing is optimal.","Ganesh, Ravindra; Salonen, Bradley R; Bhuiyan, M Nadir; Bierle, Dennis M; Moehnke, Darcie; Haddad, Tufia C; Tande, Aaron J; Wilson, John; Hurt, Ryan T",,84,15

The pandemic is still raging, with a second and third wave in a few countries, while new infections steadily rise in India. Nutrition and immune status are two critical aspects of fighting the virus successfully. Recently, selenium status was reported to positively correlate with the survival of patients with COVID-19 compared with non-survivors. We analyzed the blood serum levels in 30 apparently healthy individuals and in 30 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in the southern part of India. The patients showed significantly lower selenium levels of 69.2 ± 8.7 ng/mL than controls 79.1 ± 10.9 ng/mL. The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.0003). Interestingly, the control group showed a borderline level of selenium, suggesting that the level of this micronutrient is not optimum in the population studied. The results of this exploratory study pave the way for further research in a larger population and suggest that selenium supplementation may be helpful in reducing the effects of the virus.","Majeed, Muhammed; Nagabhushanam, Kalyanam; Gowda, Sujay; Mundkur, Lakshmi",Nutrition,84,26

It is commonly used to reduce the risk of blood coagulation in patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, or ischemic stroke.Area covered: We reviewed published articles in PubMed and Google Scholar that focused on the mutations of CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, and CYP1A2 genes related to clopidogrel clinical efficacy and safety.Expert opinion: Based on current pharmacogenetic studies, patients carrying CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, CYP2C9*3, and CYP2B6*5 alleles may not respond to clopidogrel due to poor platelet inhibition efficacy revealed among them. In contrast, carriers of CYP2C19*17, CYP3A4*1G, and CYP1A2*1F alleles showed a more significant antiplatelet effect in clopidogrel users and expected to have a protective role as a genetic factor against cardiovascular events. Genotyping for either CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, or CYP1A2 variants is not recommended when considering clopidogrel treatment for patients, as some trials showed specific non-genetic factors (e.g., age and diabetes) that could affect clopidogrel responsiveness. Instead, platelets inhibition tests could be used as predictors of the clinical efficacy and safety of clopidogrel treatment. Other P2Y12 receptor inhibitors should be considered as alternative medications.","Alkattan, Abdullah; Alsalameen, Eman",Expert opinion on drug metabolism &amp; toxicology (Online),84,16

RECENT FINDINGS: Corticosteroids have been prescribed with the objective to attenuate the marked and persistent activation of the immune system. However, some causes of community-acquired pneumonia, namely viral, are associated with unexpected low levels of cytokines and depressed cellular immunity. As a result, several recent randomized controlled trials and large prospective observational studies repeatedly showed that corticosteroids had no impact on survival, and in some types of pneumonia like influenza, its use was associated with potential harmful effects like invasive aspergillosis. Apart from this, adverse effects, namely hyperglycemia, superinfections and increased length-of-stay, were frequent findings in the corticosteroid-treated patients. SUMMARY: According to the current evidence, corticosteroids are recommended in Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-infected patients and recommendations are against its use in influenza. In all other forms of severe community-acquired pneumonia, with the exclusion of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, the strength of the evidence does not support the safe and widespread use of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy. Further studies are needed to identify subgroups of severe community-acquired pneumonia that can benefit or not from corticosteroids.","Póvoa, Pedro; Coelho, Luís; Salluh, Jorge",Curr Opin Infect Dis,84,9

As the sandfly vector transfers the promastigotes into the skin of the human host, the infection is either cured or exacerbated. In the process, there emerge several unsolved paradoxes of leishmaniasis. Chronologically, as the infections starts in skin, the role of the salivary proteins in supporting the infection or the host response to these proteins influencing the induction of immunological memory becomes a conundrum. As the parasite invokes inflammation, the infiltrating neutrophils may act as ""Trojan Horse"" to transfer parasites to macrophages that, along with dendritic cells, carry the parasite to lymphoid organs to start visceralization. As the visceralized infection becomes chronic, the acutely enhanced monocytopoiesis takes a downturn while neutropenia and thrombocytopenia ensue with concomitant rise in splenic colony-forming-units. These responses are accompanied by splenic and hepatic granulomas, polyclonal activation of B cells and deviation of T cell responses. The granuloma formation is both a containment process and a form of immunopathogenesis. The heterogeneity in neutrophils and macrophages contribute to both cure and progression of the disease. The differentiation of T-helper subsets presents another paradox of visceral leishmaniasis, as the counteractive T cell subsets influence the curing or non-curing outcome. Once the parasites are killed by chemotherapy, in some patients the cured visceral disease recurs as a cutaneous manifestation post-kala azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). As no experimental model exists, the natural history of PKDL remains almost a black box at the end of the visceral disease.","Saha, Baibaswata; Bhattacharjee, Surajit; Sarkar, Arup; Bhor, Renuka; Pai, Kalpana; Bodhale, Neelam",Cytokine,84,16

An ONP sample was obtained following bilateral conjunctiva swabs in 85 subjects with a contact history or symptoms but unknown SARS-CoV-2 status and with no ocular symptoms or findings. The results were evaluated according to the patient's symptoms and how the swab was taken. The conjunctiva swab was positive in 29 (34.1%) cases and the ONP swab in 20 (23.5%) cases. Both methods produced positive results in 11 (14.1%) cases. The mean cycle threshold (Ct ) value was 30.15 ± 3.41 in symptomatic cases and 33.62 ± 1.76 in asymptomatic cases (p = .008). The mean Ct value was 24.37 ± 3.48 when only the ONP swab was positive and 31.22 ± 1.99 when only the conjunctiva swab was positive. In cases that were positive by both methods, the mean Ct value was 25.21 ± 4.94 for the ONP swab and 30.29 ± 5.05 for the conjunctiva swab. We found higher SARS-CoV-2 detection rates with the conjunctiva swab than the ONP swab in cases with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status in the early period. In addition, the conjunctival viral load seemed to be higher in symptomatic cases than in asymptomatic cases.

ObjectiveTo investigate the intention of parents to vaccinate their children against the COVID-19 and the factors influencing this intention. MethodsWe conducted an online cross-sectional study in Greece and we collected data during the first week of September 2021. A convenience sample was used by collecting questionnaires through social media. Our study population included adult parents with children aged 12-17 years who were eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine. ResultsStudy population included 813 parents with a mean age of 42.3 years. Among parents, 36% reported that they will vaccinate their children against the COVID-19, 33.5% denied vaccination and 30.5% were undecided. Concerns about the safety, effectiveness and side effects of COVID-19 vaccines were the most important reasons for decline of COVID-19 vaccination. Parents who took the flu vaccine in 2020 and those who had more knowledge and fewer concerns about COVID-19 vaccines had a greater probability to vaccinate their children against the COVID-19. Increased self-perceived severity of COVID-19, and increased trust in COVID-19 vaccines and the government regarding the information about the COVID-19 vaccines were associated with parents intention to vaccinate their children. However, increased knowledge regarding COVID-19 was associated with decreased intention of parents to vaccinate their children. ConclusionsParents intention to vaccinate their children against the COVID-19 was low. Our findings could contribute to the development of target strategies to implement adherence to COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.","Galanis, Petros A; Vraka, Irene; Siskou, Olga; Konstantakopoulou, Olympia; Katsiroumpa, Aglaia; Moisoglou, Ioannis; Kaitelidou, Daphne",,84,20

The coronavirus crisis has affected many sectors in Romania, some companies diminishing or even ceasing their activity. Making forecasts of the unemployment rate has a fundamental impact and importance on future social policy strategies. The aim of the paper is to comparatively analyze the forecast performances of different univariate time series methods with the purpose of providing future predictions of unemployment rate. In order to do that, several forecasting models (seasonal model autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR), Holt-Winters, ETS (error, trend, seasonal), and NNAR (neural network autoregression)) have been applied, and their forecast performances have been evaluated on both the in-sample data covering the period January 2000-December 2017 used for the model identification and estimation and the out-of-sample data covering the last three years, 2018-2020. The forecast of unemployment rate relies on the next two years, 2021-2022. Based on the in-sample forecast assessment of different methods, the forecast measures root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) suggested that the multiplicative Holt-Winters model outperforms the other models. For the out-of-sample forecasting performance of models, RMSE and MAE values revealed that the NNAR model has better forecasting performance, while according to MAPE, the SARIMA model registers higher forecast accuracy. The empirical results of the Diebold-Mariano test at one forecast horizon for out-of-sample methods revealed differences in the forecasting performance between SARIMA and NNAR, of which the best model of modeling and forecasting unemployment rate was considered to be the NNAR model.","Davidescu, Adriana AnaMaria; Apostu, Simona-Andreea; Paul, Andreea",,84,29

Doffing is a critical phase that increases the risk of contamination of health care workers. Although a gamified electronic learning (e-learning) module has been shown to increase the adequate choice of PPE among prehospital personnel, it failed to enhance knowledge regarding donning and doffing sequences. Adding other training modalities such as face-to-face training to these e-learning tools is therefore necessary to increase prehospital staff proficiency and thus help reduce the risk of contamination. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the Peyton 4-step approach in addition to a gamified e-learning module for teaching the PPE doffing sequence to first-year paramedic students. METHODS: Participants will first follow a gamified e-learning module before being randomized into one of two groups. In the control group, participants will be asked to perform a PPE doffing sequence, which will be video-recorded to allow for subsequent assessment. In the experimental group, participants will first undergo face-to-face training performed by third-year students using the Peyton 4-step approach before performing the doffing sequence themselves, which will also be video-recorded. All participants will then be asked to reconstruct the doffing sequence on an online platform. The recorded sequences will be assessed independently by two investigators: a prehospital emergency medicine expert and an infection prevention and control specialist. The assessors will be blinded to group allocation. Four to eight weeks after this first intervention, all participants will be asked to record the doffing sequence once again for a subsequent skill retention assessment and to reconstruct the sequence on the same online platform to assess knowledge retention. Finally, participants belonging to the control group will follow face-to-face training. RESULTS: The study protocol has been presented to the regional ethics committee (Req-2020-01340), which issued a declaration of no objection as such projects do not fall within the scope of the Swiss federal law on human research. Study sessions were performed in January and February 2021 in Geneva, and will be performed in April and June 2021 in Bern. CONCLUSIONS: This study should help to determine whether face-to-face training using the Peyton 4-step approach improves the application and knowledge retention of a complex procedure when combined with an e-learning module.

We find that unfortunately, inequality kills: departments with higher income inequality face more deaths, more discharged (gravely ill) patients and more infections. While other papers have studied the impact of the level of income on the severity of COVID-19, we find that it is in fact the dispersion across incomes within the same department that drives the results.

CONCLUSION: Patients and healthcare staff in general practice in Ireland had relatively high rates of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 compared with the national average between 15 June and 10 July 2020 (1.7%). Four-fifths of participants with a history of confirmed COVID-19 disease still had detectable antibodies an average of 12 weeks post-infection. While not proof of immunity, SARS-CoV-2 POC testing can be used to estimate IgG seroprevalence in general practice settings.","O039,; Callaghan, Michael E; Ryan, Elizabeth; Walsh, Cathal; Hayes, Peter; Casey, Monica; Dwyer, Pat; Culhane, Aidan; Duncan, John W; Harrold, Pat; Healy, Jarlath; Kerin, Emmet; Kelly, Eimear; Hanrahan, Conor; Lane, Ger P; Lynch, Bernie; Meaney, Paraic; Connell, Billy; Galvin, Jim; Kennedy, Norelee; Burke, Paul; Connell, Nuala H; Dunne, Colum P; Glynn, Liam G",,84,24

The GHCI is defined as an index that reveals the progress and quality of the healthcare systems in countries providing their patients with easier access opportunities to healthcare services within the scope of this work. Methods of statistical analysis have been adopted together with optimization models and techniques in this research. The optimum and feasible values of the factors considered influential on objective functions have been determined as the basis of healthcare expenditure (HE) and GHCI in those relevant countries. Those released optimum outcomes are displayed between 0.64 and 0.66 in terms of desirability value. The GHCI values of those aforementioned countries range from 0 to 6. The computed average of the GHCI values of those countries is estimated as 2.4758. Finally, GHCI values of 53 countries have been calculated to set the current basis of desirability optimization models. These findings will be deemed as the basic essence of those prospective theories to be established for the future researches to constitute a new index to measure the competitiveness of healthcare systems in various countries all over the world.","Dönmez, Nergis Feride Kaplan; Atalan, Abdulkadir; Dönmez, Cem Çagri",Arab J Sci Eng,84,24

Therefore, guided by resource-based theory and the relational view, this investigation examines how organisations have used coopetition to cope with the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Key examples include retailers sharing information about stock levels, pharmaceutical organisations working together to develop a vaccine, technological giants collaborating for the greater good, and charities forming alliances for a joint cause. This paper strengthens the extant literature by highlighting the heterogeneity of coopetition strategies that firms can use within a global crisis. Practitioners must balance the risks and rewards of coopetition activities. In turn, they should decide whether to continue to cooperate with their competitors once the pandemic has ended, or resume operating under individualistic business models.

In this study, we aim to determine the rate of undetected infection in HCWs, a potential source of nosocomial infection. METHODS: Serological screening for IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was carried out among HCWs from four different hospitals in Madrid, Spain, from 6 April to 25 April 2020; HCWs with a previous diagnosis of infection based on real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR assay performed after presenting compatible symptoms were excluded. Prevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies was calculated among HCWs to obtain the rate of COVID-19 presence of antibodies in each hospital. RESULTS: Of the 7121 HCWs studied, 6344 (89.09%) had not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19. A total of 5995 HCWs finally participated in the study, resulting in a participation rate of 94.49%.

In this study we tend to repurpose already approved drugs as inhibitors of the interaction between S1-RBD and the ACE2 receptor. METHODS: 2456 approved drugs were screened against the RBD of S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 (target PDB ID: 6M17). As the interacting surface between S1-RBD and ACE2 comprises of bigger region, the interacting surface was divided into 3 sites on the basis of interactions (site 1, 2 and 3) and a total of 5 grids were generated (site 1, site 2, site 3, site 1+site 2 and site 2+site 3). A virtual screening was performed using GLIDE implementing HTVS, SP and XP screening. The top hits (on the basis of docking score) were further screened for MM-GBSA. All the top hits were further evaluated in molecular dynamics studies. Performance of the virtual screening protocol was evaluated using enrichment studies. RESULT: and discussion: We performed 5 virtual screening against 5 grids generated. A total of 42 compounds were identified after virtual screening. These drugs were further assessed for their interaction dynamics in molecular dynamics simulation. On the basis of molecular dynamics studies, we come up with 10 molecules with favourable interaction profile, which also interacted with physiologically important residues (residues taking part in the interaction between S1-RBD and ACE2. These are antidiabetic (acarbose), vitamins (riboflavin and levomefolic acid), anti-platelet agents (cangrelor), aminoglycoside antibiotics (Kanamycin, amikacin) bronchodilator (fenoterol), immunomodulator (lamivudine), and anti-neoplastic agents (mitoxantrone and vidarabine). However, while considering the relative side chain fluctuations when compared to the S1-RBD: ACE2 complex riboflavin, fenoterol, cangrelor and vidarabine emerged out as molecules with prolonged relative stability. CONCLUSION: We identified 4 already approved drugs (riboflavin, fenoterol, cangrelor and vidarabine) as possible agents for repurposing as inhibitors of S1:ACE2 interaction. In-vitro validation of these findings are necessary for identification of a safe and effective inhibitor of S1: ACE2 mediated entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell.","Prajapat, Manisha; Shekhar, Nishant; Sarma, Phulen; Avti, Pramod; Singh, Sanjay; Kaur, Hardeep; Bhattacharyya, Anusuya; Kumar, Subodh; Sharma, Saurabh; Prakash, Ajay; Medhi, Bikash",J Mol Graph Model,84,16

This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with diabetes, admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the southern region of Bangladesh. METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, treatments, complications, and clinical outcomes data were extracted from electronic medical records of 168 COVID-19 patients admitted into ICU of two COVID-19 dedicated hospitals of Chattogram, Bangladesh and compared between diabetes (n = 88) and non-diabetes (n = 80) groups. RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes was high among 51-70 years old patients. All the diabetic patients had at least one other comorbidity, with a significantly higher incidence of hypertension (53.4% vs 27.5%, P < 0.05). Prevalence of male patients (74/88; 84.1%) was slightly higher among diabetic patients than the non-diabetic patients (60/80; 75%). Even though not significant, Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that COVID-19 patients with diabetes had a shorter overall survival time than those without diabetes. In subgroup analysis, diabetic patients were classified into insulin-requiring and non-insulin-requiring groups based on their requirement of insulin during the stay in ICU. COVID-19 infected diabetic patients requiring insulin have high risk of disease progression and shorter survival time than the non-insulin required group.

It was recently reported that fluorination increases the potency of inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mutations of which have been linked specifically to nonsmall-cell lung cancer. For the L858R/T790M/C797S triplet mutant (EGFRTM), a difluorinated inhibitor, 25g, was found to have 4.23 times greater potency against the EGFRTM than an unfluorinated inhibitor, 25a. This discovery necessitates a rational explanation for the underlying inhibitory mechanisms. Here, we apply multiple computational approaches to explore, validate, and differentiate the binding modes of 25a and 25g in the EGFRTM and investigate the cooperativity effect of fluorine substituents on the inhibitory activity. Our results showed that the EGFRTM in the presence of 25g undergoes a series of conformational changes that favor inhibitor binding to both the active and allosteric sites. Further, the cooperativity effect of fluorine substituents is positive: the complex stability is increased by each additional fluorine substituent. Estimated binding free energies show good correlation with the experimental biological activity. Subsequently, the decomposition energy analysis revealed that the van der Waals interaction is the principal force contributing to variations in the binding affinities of 25a and 25g to the EGFRTM. Per-residue energy-based hierarchical clustering analysis suggests that three hot-spot residues, L718, K745, and D855, are the key in achieving optimal binding modes for 25g with higher affinity in the EGFRTM compared to 25a. This study provides a rationale for the superior EGFRTM-inhibitory potency exhibited by 25g over 25a, which is expected to be useful for the future rational structure-based design of novel EGFRTM inhibitors with improved potency and selectivity.","Akher, Farideh Badichi; Farrokhzadeh, Abdolkarim; Ravenscroft, Neil; Kuttel, Michelle M",J Phys Chem B,84,7

India has witnessed two waves affecting around 31 million people representing 16% of the cases globally. To date, the epidemic waves have not been comprehensively investigated to understand pandemic progress in India. In the present study, we aim for a cross-sectional analysis since its first incidence up to 26th July 2021. We have performed the pan Indian evolutionary study using 20,086 high-quality complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2. Based on the number of cases reported and mutation rates, we could divide the Indian epidemic into seven different phases. First, three phases constituting the pre-first wave had a very less average mutation rate (<11), which increased in the first wave to 17 and then doubled in the second wave (~34). In accordance with the mutation rate, variants of concern (alpha, beta, gamma and delta) and interest (eta and kappa) also started appearing in the first wave (1.5% of the genomes), which dominated the second (~96% of genomes) and post-second wave (100% of genomes) phases. Whole genome-based phylogeny could demarcate the post-first wave isolates from previous ones by the point of diversification leading to incidences of VOCs and VOIs in India. Nation-wide mutational analysis depicted more than 0.5 million events with four major mutations in ~97% of the total 20,086 genomes in the study. These included two mutations in coding (spike (D614G) and NSP 12b (P314L) of RNA dependent RNA polymerase), one silent mutation (NSP3 F106F) and one extragenic mutation (5 UTR 241). Large scale genome-wide mutational analysis is crucial in expanding knowledge on evolution of deadly variants of SARS-CoV-2 and timely management of the pandemic.","Kumar, Sanjeet; Bansal, Kanika",,84,1

We undertook a prospective cohort study to look into the seizure patterns and incidence of recurrence in association with two of the most common causes of RELs after gradually stopping AEDs at least 18 months after acheiving seizure control. METHODS: Ninety patients with neurocysticercosis (NCC) and twenty-nine patients with tuberculoma were treated with anti-helminthic and anti-tubercular drugs according to current recommended guidelines, and followed up for a minimum of 2 years after the last seizure free day. In every patient included in the study, AEDs were tapered within six months of attaining a seizure-free interval of 18 months. We looked at the incidence of recurrent seizures after stopping AEDs in both groups of patients. RESULTS: The frequency of baseline seizures (2.1 vs 1.5 per year, p < 0.001) and number of antiepileptic drugs (2.12 vs 1.48, p < 0.001) were greater in patients with NCC than those with tuberculoma. Patients with NCC had a greater incidence of recurrent seizures (1.17 vs 0.07 in the next six months, p < 0.001) after stopping the AEDs. The median interval to seizure recurrence after stopping AEDs was 2.2 months in patients with NCC. CONCLUSIONS: Among RELs, NCC lesions have a greater epileptogenic potential than tuberculomas. AEDs can be tapered in patients with tuberculoma after a seizure free period of 18 months with a very low risk of recurrence.","Pradhan, Sunil; Das, Animesh; Mulmuley, Madhura; Das, Ananya",Seizure,84,16

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine whether there is a change in QT, QTc, Tpe interval, Tpe/QT ratio, and Tpe/QTc ratio in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The study included 90 patients with COVID-19 infection and 30 age-and-sex-matched healthy controls. QT, QTc, Tpe interval, Tpe/QT ratio, and Tpe/QTc ratio were measured. The participants included in the study were divided into the following 4 groups: healthy controls (group I), patients with COVID-19 without pneumonia (group II), patients with COVID-19 and mild pneumonia (group III), and patients with COVID-19 and severe pneumonia (group IV). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: It was found that baseline heart rate, presence of hypertension and diabetes, white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, potassium, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, NT-proBNP, high sensitive C reactive protein, D-dimer, hs-cTnI, Tpe, Tpe/QT, and Tpe/QTc increased from group I to group IV, and they were significantly higher in all patients in group IV (p < 0.05). Systolic-diastolic blood pressure, hemoglobin, and calcium levels were found to be lowest in group IV and significantly lower than in other groups (< 0.05). QT and QTc intervals were similar between groups. It was determined that increased heart rate, calcium, D-dimer, NT-proBNP and hs-CRP levels were significantly related to Tpe, Tpe/QT, and Tpe/QTc. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19 and severe pneumonia, Tpe, Tpe/QT ratio, and Tpe/QTc ratio, which are among ventricular repolarization parameters, were found to be increased, without prolonged QT and QTc intervals.

The adsorption behaviors of different species of lead (Pb, PbO, PbCl and PbCl2) on the Al2O3 surfaces were explored based on density functional theory. The results show that the chemisorption mechanism is responsible for the adsorption of lead species on the Al2O3 surface. The high reactivity of Pb adsorption on the &#945;-Al2O3 (110) surface is mainly attributed to the existence of unsaturated Al atoms. The Al hollow sites are identified as the effectively active sites for Pb adsorption on the (110) surface. The adsorption energies of different species of lead on the Al-terminated (110) surface are in the range of - 4.20 to - 6.30 eV. PbO adsorption at the Al hollow site of the Al-terminated (110) surface shows the highest adsorption energy (- 6.30 eV), suggesting that Al2O3 prefers to capture PbO among different species of lead. The strong interactions of PbO, PbCl and PbCl2 molecules with the unsaturated Al atoms of the &#945;-Al2O3 (110) surface are responsible for PbO, PbCl and PbCl2 capture by Al2O3. Al2O3 has a good ability to capture different species of lead, and the adsorption capacity follows the order: PbO > Pb > PbCl > PbCl2.","Zhang, Aijia; Liu, Jing; Zhang, Zhen; Yang, Yingju; Yu, Yingni; Zhao, Yongchun",J Hazard Mater,84,29

Results and Discussion: The DPP-BDT NPs exhibited excellent optical stability, strong near-infrared (NIR) light absorption as well as fine biocompatibility. After tail vein injection into the living mice, the PA signals in the neoplastic tissues were gradually increased and reached to the maximum at the 4-h post-injection, which was consistent with the PET analysis. Such strong PA and PET signals were attributed to the efficient NPs accumulation resulting from the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Conclusion: The biocompatible DPP-BDT NPs demonstrated to be strong NIR absorption property and PAI sensitivity. Besides, these novel DPP-BDT NPs can act not only as a PA imaging contrast agent but also as an imaging agent for PET.","Li, Tingting; Hu, Xiaoming; Fan, Quli; Chen, Zejing; Zheng, Ziliang; Zhang, Ruiping",Int J Nanomedicine,84,16

N6-methylation of adenosine (m6A) in RNA regulates many physiological and disease processes. Here, we investigate m6A modification of the SARS-CoV-2 gene in regulating the host cell innate immune response. Our data show that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has m6A modifications that are enriched in the 3' end of the viral genome. We find that depletion of the host cell m6A methyltransferase METTL3 decreases m6A levels in SARS-CoV-2 and host genes, and m6A reduction in viral RNA increases RIG-I binding and subsequently enhances the downstream innate immune signaling pathway and inflammatory gene expression. METTL3 expression is reduced and inflammatory genes are induced in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These findings will aid in the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and the design of future studies regulating innate immunity for COVID-19 treatment.","Li, Na; Hui, Hui; Bray, Bill; Gonzalez, Gwendolyn Michelle; Zeller, Mark; Anderson, Kristian G; Knight, Rob; Smith, Davey; Wang, Yinsheng; Carlin, Aaron F; Rana, Tariq M",Cell Rep,84,1

We aimed to quantify the effects of COVID-19 on the digestive system. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for studies published between Jan 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020. The websites of WHO, CDC, and major journals were also searched. We included studies that reported the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 and the prevalence of gastrointestinal findings in infected patients, and excluded preprints, duplicate publications, reviews, editorials, single case reports, studies pertaining to other coronavirus-related illnesses, and small case series (<10 cases). Extracted data included author; date; study design; country; patient demographics; number of participants in severe and non-severe disease groups; prevalence of clinical gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and belching; and digestive system comorbidities including liver disease and gastrointestinal diseases. Raw data from studies were pooled to determine effect estimates. FINDINGS: We analysed findings from 35 studies, including 6686 patients with COVID-19, that met inclusion criteria. 29 studies (n=6064) reported gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with COVID-19 at diagnosis, and the pooled prevalence of digestive system comorbidities was 4% (95% CI 2-5; range 0-15; I2=74%). The pooled prevalence of digestive symptoms was 15% (10-21; range: 2-57; I2=96%) with nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea, and loss of appetite being the three most common symptoms. The pooled prevalence of abnormal liver functions (12 studies, n=1267) was 19% (9-32; range 1-53; I2=96%). Subgroup analysis showed patients with severe COVID-19 had higher rates of abdominal pain (odds ratio [OR] 7·10 [95% CI 1·93-26·07]; p=0·003; I2=0%) and abnormal liver function including increased ALT (1·89 [1·30-2·76]; p=0·0009; I2=10%) and increased AST (3·08 [2·14-4·42]; p<0·00001; I2=0%) compared with those with non-severe disease. Patients in Hubei province, where the initial COVID-19 outbreak occurred, were more likely to present with abnormal liver functions (p<0·0001) compared with those outside of Hubei. Paediatric patients with COVID-19 had a similar prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms to those of adult patients. 10% (95% CI 4-19; range 3-23; I2=97%) of patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms alone without respiratory features. Patients who presented with gastrointestinal system involvement had delayed diagnosis (standardised mean difference 2·85 [95% CI 0·22-5·48]; p=0·030; I2=73%). Patients with gastrointestinal involvement tended to have a poorer disease course (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome OR 2·96 [95% CI 1·17-7·48]; p=0·02; I2=0%). INTERPRETATION: Our study showed that digestive symptoms and liver injury are not uncommon in patients with COVID-19. Increased attention should be paid to the care of this unique group of patients.

This study aimed to understand HIV testing behaviours among men who have sex with men (MSM) and specifically how HIVST was used during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) measures in China when access to facility-based testing was limited. METHODS: An online cross-sectional study was conducted to recruit men who have sex with men (MSM) in China from May to June of 2020, a period when COVID-19 measures were easing. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, sexual behaviours and HIV testing in the three months before and during COVID-19 measures (23 January 2020) were collected. Chi-square test and logistic regression were used for analyses. RESULTS: Overall, 685 MSM were recruited from 135 cities in 30 provinces of China, whose mean age was 28.8 (SD: 6.9) years old. The majority of participants self-identified as gay (81.9%) and had disclosed their sexual orientation (66.7%). In the last three months, 69.6% ever had sex with men, nearly half of whom had multiple sexual partners (47.2%). Although the overall HIV testing rates before and during COVID-19 measures were comparable, more MSM self-tested for HIV during COVID-19 measures (52.1%) compared to before COVID-19 measures (41.6%, p = 0.038). Fewer MSM used facility-based HIV testing during COVID-19 measures (42.9%) compared to before COVID-19 measures (54.1%, p = 0.038). Among 138 facility-based testers before COVID-19 measures, 59.4% stopped facility-based testing during COVID-19 measures. Among 136 self-testers during COVID-19 measures, 58.1% had no HIV self-testing before COVID-19 measures. Multivariable logistic regression showed that having sex with other men in the last three months (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.38 to 3.03), self-identifying as gay (aOR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.31 to 3.13), ever disclosing their sexual orientation (aOR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.19 to 2.50) and tested for HIV in three months before COVID-19 measures (aOR = 4.74, 95% CI: 3.35 to 6.70) were associated with HIV testing during COVID-19 measures. CONCLUSIONS: Facility-based HIV testing decreased and HIVST increased among MSM during COVID-19 measures in China. MSM successfully accessed HIVST as substitute for facility-based testing, with no overall decrease in HIV testing rates.","Jiang, Hongbo; Xie, Yewei; Xiong, Yuan; Zhou, Yi; Lin, Kaihao; Yan, Yao; Tucker, Joseph; Ong, Jason J; Wu, Dan; Yang, Fan; Tang, Weiming",J Int AIDS Soc,84,21

The incidence and prevalence of myopia have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to investigate and evaluate the impact of the home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic on the progression of myopia among children and adolescents in Chongqing, China. Methods: The survey was conducted by using stratified samplings. Samples were randomly selected from the 2019 National Student Physique and Health Survey database, and their visual function and refractive data were compared with those in 2020. Vision-related behavior questionnaire including digital screen exposure was applied to investigate the correlation between eye parameter and eye health-related behavior. Results: A total of 1,733 and 1,728 students were enrolled in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The percentage of myopia students was 55.02% in 2020, which was higher than that in 2019 (44.62%). The mean uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA, LogMAR, 0.35 ± 0.42) in 2020 was higher than that in 2019 (0.27 ± 0.36, P < 0.001). The mean spherical equivalent (SE) refraction (-1.94 ± 2.13 D) in 2020 was lower than that in 2019 (-1.64 ± 5.49 D, P < 0.001). For students who used digital devices for online courses, the mean SE in the television group (-1.10 ± 1.49 D) was better than that in the computer group (-2.03 ± 2.37 D, P = 0.0017) and in the cell phone group (-2.02 ± 2.09 D, P = 0.0028).

The present study aimed to reveal risk factors associated with mental health problems and suggest concrete coping strategies in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted in July when Japan was experiencing a second wave of COVID-19. Demographics, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), state anger, anger control, and the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced were measured. Multivariate logistic regression analysis on PHQ-9 scores by set variables was conducted. RESULTS: The participants were 2708 individuals, and 18.35% of them were depressed. Logistic regression analysis showed that in the order of odds ratios (ORs), underlying disease (OR = 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.32-2.92), not working (OR = 1.85, CI = 1.22-2.80), negative economic impact (OR = 1.33, CI = 1.01-1.77), state anger (OR = 1.17, CI = 1.14-1.21), anger control (OR = 1.08, CI = 1.04-1.13), age (OR = 0.97, CI = 0.96-0.98), high income (OR = 0.45, CI = 0.25-0.80), and being married (OR = 0.53, CI = 0.38-0.74) were predictors of depressive symptoms. Regarding coping strategies, planning (OR = 0.84, CI = 0.74-0.94), use of instrumental support (OR = 0.85, CI = 0.76-0.95), denial (OR = 0.88, CI = 0.77-0.99), behavioural disengagement (OR = 1.28, CI = 1.13-1.44), and self-blame (OR = 1.47, CI = 1.31-1.65) were associated with probable depression. CONCLUSIONS: During prolonged psychological distress caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Japan was two to nine times as high as before the COVID-19 pandemic, even though Japan was not a lockdown country. Although some coping strategies were useful for maintaining mental health, such as developing ways, alone or with others, to address or avoid social dislocations, the influence of demographics was more powerful than these coping strategies, and medical treatments are needed for high-risk individuals.","Fukase, Yuko; Ichikura, Kanako; Murase, Hanako; Tagaya, Hirokuni",BMC Psychiatry,84,24

We sought to examine the expression pattern of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell-entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the role of lung progenitor cells in children and older patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed clinical features in a cohort of 299 patients with COVID-19. The expression and distribution of ACE2 and lung progenitor cells were systematically examined using a combination of public single-cell RNA-seq datasets, lung biopsies, and ex vivo infection of lung tissues with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in children and older adults. We also followed up patients who had recovered from COVID-19. RESULTS: Compared with children, older patients (> 50 yrs.) were more likely to develop into serious pneumonia with reduced lymphocytes and aberrant inflammatory response (p = 0.001). The expression level of ACE2 and lung progenitor cell markers were generally decreased in older patients. Notably, ACE2 positive cells were mainly distributed in the alveolar region, including SFTPC positive cells, but rarely in airway regions in the older adults (p < 0.01). The follow-up of discharged patients revealed a prolonged recovery from pneumonia in the older (p < 0.025). CONCLUSION: Compared to children, ACE2 positive cells are generally decreased in older adults and mainly presented in the lower pulmonary tract. The lung progenitor cells are also decreased. These risk factors may impact disease severity and recovery from pneumonia caused by SARS-Cov-2 infection in older patients.","Zhang, Zhao; Guo, Liyan; Huang, Li; Zhang, Che; Luo, Ruibang; Zeng, Liang; Liang, Huiying; Li, Qiuhui; Lu, Xiaoxia; Wang, Xianfeng; Yan Ma, Chui; Shao, Jianbo; Luo, Weiren; Li, Le; Liu, Li; Li, Ziyue; Zhou, Xiaoya; Zhang, Xiaoxian; Liu, Jie; Yang, Jinjian; Kwan, Ka Yi; Liu, Wei; Xu, Yi; Jiang, Hua; Liu, Hongsheng; Du, Hui; Wu, Yanheng; Yu, Guangyin; Chen, Junhui; Wu, Jieying; Zhang, Jinqiu; Liao, Can; Chen, Huanhuan Joyce; Chen, Zhiwei; Tse, Hung-Fat; Xia, Huimin; Lian, Qizhou",Clin. infect. dis,84,29

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort of consecutive patients with renal oncocytoma on active surveillance reviewed at the Specialist Centre for Kidney Cancer at Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust (2012 to 2019). Comparison between groups was tested using the Mann-Whitney U and the Chi-square tests. A mixed-effects model with a random intercept for patient was used to study the longitudinal association between tumour size and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). RESULTS: Longitudinal data from 98 patients with 101 lesions was analysed. Most patients were male (68.3%), median age was 69 years (IQR 13). The median follow-up was 29 months (IQR 26). Most lesions were small renal masses, 24% measured over 4 cm. Over half (64.4%) grew at a median rate of 2 mm per year (IQR 4). No association was observed between tumour size and eGFR over time (p=0.871). Nine lesions (8.9%) were subsequently treated. Two deaths were reported, neither were related to the diagnosis of renal oncocytoma. CONCLUSION: Natural history data from the largest active surveillance cohort of renal oncocytomas to date show that renal function does not seem to be negatively impacted by growing oncocytomas, and confirms clinical outcomes are excellent after a median follow up of over 2 years. Active surveillance should be considered the gold standard management of renal oncocytomas up to 7cm.","Neves, Joana B; Varley, Rebecca; Agnesi, Stefano; Withington, John; Rodrigues, Filipe B; Warren, Hannah; Yuminaga, Yuigi; Capitanio, Umberto; Rode, Nicola; Grant, Lee; Tran-Dang, My-Anh; El-Sheikh, Soha; Walkden, Miles; Cullen, David; Aitchison, Michael; Patki, Prasad; Mumtaz, Faiz; Barod, Ravi; Bex, Axel; Tran, Maxine G B",BJU int,84,29

A mixed-methods study at a single institution,18.52309,10.459479,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has led to a global pandemic. However, the majority of currently available data are restricted to laboratory-confirmed cases for symptomatic patients, and the SARS-CoV-2 infection can manifest as an asymptomatic or mild disease. Therefore, the true extent of the burden of COVID-19 may be underestimated. Improved serological detection of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 could help estimate the true numbers of infections. This article comprehensively reviews the associated literature and provides updated information regarding the seroprevalence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody. The seroprevalence can vary across different sites and the seroprevalence can increase with time during longitudinal follow-up. Although healthcare workers (HCWs), especially those caring for COVID-19 patients, are considered as a high-risk group, the seroprevalence in HCWs wearing adequate personal protective equipment is thought to be no higher than that in other groups. With regard to sex, no statistically significant difference has been found between male and female subjects. Some, but not all, studies have shown that children have a lower risk than other age groups. Finally, seroprevalence can vary according to different populations, such as pregnant women and hemodialysis patients; however, limited studies have examined these associations. Furthermore, the continued surveillance of seroprevalence is warranted to estimate and monitor the growing burden of COVID-19.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Wang, Jui-Hsiang; Hsueh, Po-Ren",Int J Infect Dis,84,24

By May 10, 2020, it caused more than 280 000 deaths all over the world. Preliminary data reported a high prevalence of CoV-2 infection and mortality due to severe acute respiratory syndrome related CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in kidney-transplanted patients (KTRs). Nevertheless, the outcomes and the best treatments for SARS-CoV-2-affected KTRs remain unclear. METHODS: In this report, we describe the clinical data, the treatments, and the outcomes of 5 KTRs with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to our hospital in Ancona, Marche region, Italy, from March 17 to present. Due to the severity of SARS-CoV-2, immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors, antimetabolites, and mTOR-inhibitors were stopped at the admission. All KTRs were treated with low-dose steroids. 4/5 KTRs were treated with hydroxychloroquine. All KTRs received tocilizumab up to one dose. RESULTS: Overall, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in KTRs in the Marche region was 0.85%. 3/5 were admitted in ICU and intubated. One developed AKI with the need of CRRT with Cytosorb. At present, two patients died, two patients were discharged, and one is still inpatient in ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The critical evaluation of all cases suggests that the timing of the administration of tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, could be associated with a better efficacy when administered in concomitance to the drop of the oxygen saturation. Thus, in SARS-CoV-2-affected KTRs, a close biochemical and clinical monitoring should be set up to allow physicians to hit the virus in the right moment such as a sudden reduction of the oxygen saturation and/or a significant increase in the laboratory values such as D-dimer.","Maritati, Federica; Cerutti, Elisabetta; Zuccatosta, Lina; Fiorentini, Alessandro; Finale, Carolina; Ficosecco, Marta; Cristiano, Fabrizio; Capestro, Alessandro; Balestra, Emilio; Taruscia, Domenica; Vivarelli, Marco; Donati, Abele; Perna, Gian Piero; Giacometti, Andrea; Tavio, Marcello; Onesta, Maicol; Di Sante, Laura; Ranghino, Andrea",Transpl Infect Dis,84,24

The usual lopinavir trough plasma concentrations are 3000-8000â ng/mL. A trend towards a 28â day mortality reduction was observed in COVID-19-infected patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. OBJECTIVES: To assess the plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients with severe COVID-19 infection and receiving lopinavir/ritonavir. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 infection included in the French COVID-19 cohort and treated with lopinavir/ritonavir were included. Lopinavir/ritonavir combination was administered using the usual adult HIV dose regimen (400/100â mg q12h, oral solution through a nasogastric tube). A half-dose reduction to 400/100â mg q24h was proposed if lopinavir Ctrough was >8000â ng/mL, the upper limit considered as toxic and reported in HIV-infected patients. Lopinavir and ritonavir pharmacokinetic parameters were determined after an intensive pharmacokinetic analysis. Biological markers of inflammation and liver/kidney function were monitored. RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir were first assessed in eight patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. Median (IQR) lopinavir Ctrough reached 27â¯908â ng/mL (15â¯928-32â¯627). After the dose reduction to 400/100â mg q24h, lopinavir/ritonavir pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed in nine patients. Lopinavir Ctrough decreased to 22â¯974â ng/mL (21â¯394-32â¯735). CONCLUSIONS: In mechanically ventilated patients with severe COVID-19 infections, the oral administration of lopinavir/ritonavir elicited plasma exposure of lopinavir more than 6-fold the upper usual expected range.

Antibody therapy and vaccines are promising approaches to treat the disease; however, they have bottlenecks: they might have low efficacy or narrow breadth due to the continuous emergence of new strains of the virus or antibodies could cause antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. To address these bottlenecks, I propose the use of 24-meric ferritin for the synthesis of mosaic nanocages to deliver a cocktail of antibodies or nanobodies alone or in combination with another therapeutic, like a nucleotide analogue, to mimic the viral entry process and deceive the virus, or to develop mosaic vaccines. I argue that available data showing the effectiveness of ferritin-antibody conjugates in targeting specific cells and ferritin-haemagglutinin nanocages in developing influenza vaccines strongly support my proposals.","Honarmand Ebrahimi, Kourosh",Chembiochem,84,23

METHODS: COVID-19 SEIR transmission dynamics model was established, which took transmission ability in latent period and tracking quarantine interventions into consideration. Based on the epidemic data of Hubei province from January 23, 2020 to February 24, 2020, the parameters of the newly established modified SEIR model were fitted. By using Euler integral algorithm to solve the modified SEIR dynamics model, the epidemic situation in Hubei province was analyzed, and the impact of prevention and control measures such as quarantine and centralized treatment on the epidemic development was discussed. RESULTS: The theoretical estimation of the epidemic situation by the modified SEIR epidemic dynamics model is in good agreement with the actual situation in Hubei province. Theoretical analysis showed that prevention and control quarantine and medical follow-up quarantine played an important inhibitory effect on the outbreak of the epidemic.The centralized treatment played a key role in the rapid decline in the number of infected people. In addition, it is suggested that individuals should improve their prevention awareness and take strict self-protection measures to curb the increase in infected people.

While vaccine damage as a scientific fact is statistically highly uncommon, emerging social and technological forces have converted probable vaccine damage into an alternative fact. Methods: Using the Eurobarometer 91.2 survey on a statistically representative EU27-UK sample interviewed in March 2019, we documented perceptions of vaccine risks and identified three belief configurations regarding vaccine effectiveness, safety, and usefulness, through exploratory cluster analysis. Results: The public beliefs in vaccine risks are frequent. Approximatively one-tenth of the EU27-UK population consider vaccines are not rigorously tested before authorization, one-third believe vaccines can overload or weaken the immune system and that they can cause the disease against which they protect, and almost one-half believe vaccines can cause serious side effects. We identified three belief configurations: the skeptical, the confident, and the trade-off clusters. The skeptical type (approx. 11 percent of EU27-UK respondents) is defined by the belief that vaccines are rather ineffective, affected by risks of probable vaccine damage, not well-tested, and useless; the confident type (approx. 59 percent) is defined by beliefs that vaccines are effective, safe, well-tested, and useful; and the trade-off type (approx. 29 percent) combines beliefs that vaccines are effective, well-tested and useful, with beliefs of probable vaccine damage. Conclusions: Probable vaccine damage presently exists as an alternative fact in the public imagination, perceptively available for wide segments of the public, including those who trust medical science.","Vulpe, Simona Nicoleta; Rughinis, Cosima",,84,30

Method: A descriptive analysis of pre-and post-operative Oxford Shoulder Scores and change scores were performed. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to measure the effect of physiotherapy on post-operative OSS, with pre-operative OSS as the only covariate. Results: The results for post-operative OSS were significantly greater for Group 2 than for Group 1 (40.7 for NHS and 44.7 for private, improvement of 17.32 for NHS and 18.23 for Private). The estimated effect of physiotherapy on postoperative OSS was an increase of 3.2 (95% confidence interval 1.5-4.8). Conclusions: We detected a statistically significant increase in postoperative OSS in patients treated for frozen shoulder with MUA + physiotherapy compared with patients receiving MUA plus advice alone. These results suggest that physiotherapy does confer a real benefit, however the increased OSS is below the clinically significant level. Therefore, in a resource poor environment, such as may exist after COVID in many health care systems, MUA plus physio advice alone gives an excellent outcome for the treatment of FS.","Castelhano, R.; Woods, J.; Akehurst, H.; Mitra, A.; James, M.; Tasker, A.; Woods, D.",British Journal of Surgery,84,15

As domestic food prices have continued to rise, worsening the living conditions of millions, and state policies seek to guarantee the population's access to food, the hegemonic agribusiness sector is fostering new alliances to strengthen its integration into global agri-food markets. A full understanding of agribusiness' strategies needs to address the changes brought about by the pandemic on peasant-like farmers and rural workers, the alternatives they have developed (mainly agroecology) in their struggle against the dominant food regime in recent years, and explore the extent to which local expressions of this antagonism are being reshaped.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We created the RESCUE registry, a retrospective, observational registry of adult patients treated with VA-ECMO between January 2007 and June 2017 at 3 high-volume centers (Columbia University, Duke University, and Washington University) to describe short-term patient outcomes. In 723 patients treated with VA-ECMO, the most common indications for deployment were postcardiotomy shock (31%), cardiomyopathy (including acute heart failure) (26%), and myocardial infarction (17%). Patients frequently suffered in-hospital complications, including acute renal dysfunction (45%), major bleeding (41%), and infection (33%). Only 40% of patients (nâ¯=â¯290) survived to discharge, with a minority receiving durable cardiac support (left ventricular assist device [nâ¯=â¯48] or heart transplantation [nâ¯=â¯7]). Multivariable regression analysis identified risk factors for mortality on ECMO as older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.42) and female sex (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.02-2.02) and risk factors for mortality after decannulation as higher body mass index (OR 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.35) and major bleeding while on ECMO support (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.23-2.99). CONCLUSIONS: Despite contemporary care at high-volume centers, patients treated with VA-ECMO continue to have significant in-hospital morbidity and mortality.

So far, COVID-19 has affected 85 403 patients in 57 countries/territories and has caused 2924 deaths in 9 countries. However, epidemiological data differ between countries. Although China had higher morbidity and mortality than other sites, the number of new daily cases in China has been lower than outside of China since 26 February 2020. The incidence ranged from 61.44 per 1 000 000 people in the Republic of Korea to 0.0002 per 1 000 000 people in India. The daily cumulative index (DCI) of COVID-19 (cumulative cases/no. of days between the first reported case and 29 February 2020) was greatest in China (1320.85), followed by the Republic of Korea (78.78), Iran (43.11) and Italy (30.62). However, the DCIs in other countries/territories were <10 per day. Several effective measures including restricting travel from China, controlling the distribution of masks, extensive investigation of COVID-19 spread, and once-daily press conferences by the government to inform and educate people were aggressively conducted in Taiwan. This is probably the reason why there was only 39 cases (as of 29 February 2020) with a DCI of 1 case per day in Taiwan, which is much lower than that of nearby countries such as the Republic of Korea and Japan. In addition, the incidence and mortality were correlated with the DCI.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March 9th to June 9th 2020, 207 patients were phone-triaged by a dedicated Breast Care Nurse; a patient-tailored program was adopted with the aim of avoiding hospitalization of SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic patients, with a careful prioritization of surgical procedures according to specific disease features. RESULTS: Two hundred and three out of 207 patients underwent operation; seven patients were temporarily excluded because they tested positive at phone triage (n=3), or in-hospital triage (n=3); another asymptomatic patient with negative NP swab tested IgM Ab-positive so that surgery was re-scheduled two weeks later. Four patients had no surgery; one of them was reconsidered for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) after testing positive at phone triage; three patients were excluded because they were already hospitalized for COVID-19. Overall, mean in-hospital stay was 2.2 days (±SD, 0.7) and, after hospital discharge, no patient required readmission. CONCLUSION: This preventive program avoided any COVID-19 infection among patients and HCWs, so that an elective breast cancer surgical procedure can be safely and timely pursued without affecting the oncologic outcome.","Fregatti, Piero; Gipponi, Marco; Giacchino, Maria; Sparavigna, Marco; Diaz, Raquel; Fioravanti, Emanuela; Cornacchia, Chiara; Conte, Benedetta; Lambertini, Matteo; Zoppoli, Gabriele; Murelli, Federica; Toni, Maria Luisa; Calabro, Maria Teresa; Orsino, Lina; Friedman, Daniele",In Vivo,84,16

During the pandemic, half the globe's population have been placed under strict physical distancing orders and many long-term care facilities serving older adults went into lockdown mode, restricting access to all visitors, including family members. Before the pandemic emerged, a 2020 National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine report warned of the underappreciated adverse effects of social isolation and loneliness on health, especially among older populations. Social isolation and loneliness predict all-cause mortality at rates that rival clinical risk factors, such as obesity and smoking; they are associated with greater incidence of psychological, cognitive, and physical morbidities. This paper sets forth a proposal to design robots to function as companions and friends for socially isolated and lonely older people during pandemic emergencies and in aging societies more generally.

Here, we investigated for the first time whether, consistent with psychological models of loneliness, biased interpretations of social situations could prospectively predict loneliness in youth. 104 young people completed measures of loneliness and interpretations of ambiguous social and non-social (bodily or health-related) situations at three time-points with intervals of three months between each. As government-imposed social distancing measures (to control the COVID-19 outbreak) occurred between Times 2 and 3 (but not between Times 1 and 2), this enabled us to assess whether restricted social activity could provoke greater predictive power of biased interpretational styles on loneliness. Using cross-lagged panel models, we showed that after estimating paths representing within-time across-variable (""concurrent"") paths and across-time within-variable (""stability"") paths, there were no significant cross-lag 'causal' paths between earlier interpretational style and later loneliness. Between Time 2 and 3, we demonstrated a significant cross-lag 'consequential' path between earlier loneliness and later threatening interpretations of social situations, but this became non-significant after controlling for concurrent anxiety and depression.

Nursing students have been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in documented trauma, complicated grief, depression, anxiety, and secondary stress syndrome. Students entering health care in a new landscape of ongoing trauma and chronic stress exposure require a shift in the nurse educators' role and position. Extensive outcome-based synthesis of trauma-informed education in other disciplines served as basis to create a pedagogical context using the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) framework for trauma-informed schools. Utilizing Watson's strategies for human caring theory in nursing education, a trauma-informed pedagogy is proposed for nurse educators. This framework for nurse educators and leaders will assist in navigating how to approach trauma-informed education in the context of higher education in nursing.

In this essay, a novel class of scaffolds are proposed, whose action bears striking resemblance to kinetic proofreading. Commonly, scaffold proteins are thought to work as tethers, bringing different components of a pathway together to improve the likelihood of their interaction. However, recent studies show that the cytoskeletal scaffold, anillin, supports contractile signaling by a novel, non-tethering mechanism that controls the membrane dissociation kinetics of RhoA. More generally, such proof-reading-like scaffolds are distinguished from tethers by a rare type of cooperativity, manifest as a super-linear relationship between scaffold concentration and signaling efficiency.

AIM: The study was performed to describe the changes in hospital admissions during the first phase of the pandemic. METHODS: The Norwegian Institute of Public Health established a national preparedness register with daily updates on COVID-19 cases and the use of health services. We used individual-level information on inpatients from the electronic journal systems for all hospitals in Norway to estimate daily hospital admissions. RESULTS: Before the onset of the pandemic in March, there was an average of 2400 inpatient admissions per day in Norway, which decreased to approximately 1500 in the first few days after lockdown measures were implemented. The relative magnitudes of the decreases were similar in men and women and across all age groups. The decreases were substantial for both elective (54%) and emergency (29%) inpatient care. The admission rate gradually increased and reached pre-pandemic levels in June. However, the reductions in admissions for pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease seemed to persist. CONCLUSIONS: The elective and emergency inpatient admission rates were substantially reduced a few days after the pandemic response measures were implemented. The ways in which the lack or postponement of care may have affected the health and well-being of patients is an important issue to be addressed in future research.","Helgeland, Jon; Telle, Kjetil E; Grøsland, Mari; Huseby, Beate M; Håberg, Siri; Lindman, Anja S E",Scand J Public Health,84,1

During the outbreak of COVID-19, an internet-based questionnaire included The Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was used to assess the impact of the pandemic situation on the mental health of medical staff and general population in Wuhan and its surrounding areas. Among the 1493 questionnaires completed, 827 (55.39%) of these were men, and 422 (28.27%) of these were medical personnel. The results suggest that the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected individuals significantly, the degree of which is related to age, sex, occupation and mental illness. There was a significant difference in PSS-10 and IES-R scores between the medical staff and the general population. The medical staff showed higher PSS-10 scores (16.813 ± 4.87) and IES-R scores (22.40 ± 12.12) compared to members of the general population PSS-10 (14.80 ± 5.60) and IES-R scores (17.89 ± 13.08). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the SDS scores of medical staff (44.52 ± 12.36) and the general public (43.08 ± 11.42). In terms of the need for psychological assistance, 50.97% of interviewees responded that they needed psychological counseling, of which medical staff accounted for 65.87% and non-medical staff accounted for 45.10%. During the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, great attention should be paid to the mental health of the population, especially medical staff, and measures such as psychological intervention should be actively carried out for reducing the psychosocial effects.","Chen, Biao; Li, Qing-Xian; Zhang, Heng; Zhu, Jia-Yong; Yang, Xu; Wu, Yu-Hang; Xiong, Jie; Li, Fu; Wang, Hua; Chen, Zhi-Tao",Curr Psychol,84,16

Throughout the pandemic, international travel has been a highly contested subject at both the international and national levels. We examined Canadian media reporting on international travel restrictions during the pandemic, how these restrictions aligned with the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), and how the narrative around international travel evolved over time. METHODS: We analysed articles from Canada's top three national newspapers by circulation - The Globe and Mail, The National Post and The Toronto Star - published between Jan 1, 2020 - May 31, 2020. Our search yielded a total of 378 articles across the three newspapers. After removing duplicates and screening the remaining articles, we included a total of 62 articles for the analysis. We conducted a qualitative media content analysis by using an inductive coding approach. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified within the articles. These included: 1) The role of scientific and expert evidence in implementing travel restrictions; 2) Federal legislation, regulation and enforcement of international travel measures; and 3) Compliance with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines in travel restriction policy- and decision-making. The federal government relied primarily on scientific evidence for implementing international travel restrictions and fully exercised its powers under the Quarantine Act to enforce travel regulations and comply with the IHR 2005. The government embraced a rules-based international order by following WHO recommendations on international travel, contributing to a delay in border closure and travel restrictions until mid-March. CONCLUSION: The media focussed significantly on international travel-related issues during the early phase of the pandemic. The dominant media narrative surrounded the need for earlier travel restrictions against international travel.","Reddy, K Srikanth; Mithani, Salima S; Wilson, Lindsay; Wilson, Kumanan",BMC Public Health,84,1

We aimed to collate global experience and provide provisional guidance for managing paediatric IBD (PIBD) in the era of COVID-19. METHODS: An electronic reporting system of children with IBD infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been circulated among 102 PIBD centres affiliated with the Porto and Interest-group of ESPGHAN. A survey has been completed by major PIBD centres in China and South-Korea to explore management during the pandemic. A third survey collected current practice of PIBD treatment. Finally, guidance points for practice have been formulated and voted upon by 37 PIBD authors and Porto group members. RESULTS: Eight PIBD children had COVID-19 globally, all with mild infection without needing hospitalization despite treatment with immunomodulators and/or biologics. No cases have been reported in China and South Korea but biologic treatment has been delayed in 79 children, of whom 17 (22%) had exacerbation of their IBD. Among the Porto group members, face-to-face appointments were often replaced by remote consultations but almost all did not change current IBD treatment. Ten guidance points for clinicians caring for PIBD patients in epidemic areas have been endorsed with consensus rate of 92% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data for PIBD patients during COVID-19 outbreak are reassuring. Standard IBD treatments including biologics should continue at present through the pandemic, especially in children who generally have more severe IBD course on one hand, and milder SARS-CoV-2 infection on the other.","Turner, Dan; Huang, Ying; Martín-de-Carpi, Javier; Aloi, Marina; Focht, Gili; Kang, Ben; Zhou, Ying; Sanchez, Cesar; Kappelman, Michael D; Uhlig, Holm H; Pujol-Muncunill, Gemma; Ledder, Oren; Lionetti, Paolo; Dias, Jorge Amil; Ruemmele, Frank M; Russell, Richard K",J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,84,26
514574,514574,514574,Long term extracorporeal membrane oxygenation bridge to lung transplant after COVID-19,18.623728,10.83507,2021,"The article focuses on the fact that 2020 has become a new point in the history of mankind, irrevocably changing the ways of life accepted in society and forcing the entire population of the earth to live in a new way. If a person's health is threatened and / or worried about the thought of a terminal illness, it is difficult to focus on something else. Over the past year, many have experienced this reality for the first time. Effective January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus outbreak a health emergency, causing international concern. The fact that some countries (New Zealand, Australia and South Korea) quickly contained the spread of the virus, but faced new, imported cases, leads to the conclusion that the victory over COVID-19 is possible only worldwide. And if in 2020 masks and social distancing were the methods of fighting the virus, then the main method of 2021 will be the vaccination of the inhabitants of the earth. However, here, too, the key factor is the scale of vaccination, which is one of the main factors in the effectiveness of the fight against any large-scale disease. Here, every person faces a moral and legal question: participation in vaccination is the right of every person as a bearer of human dignity, which implies the impossibility of taking any action on a person without his consent, or the duty of a member of society, which implies the need for vaccination as the question of the survival of the human race as a whole. The article draws attention to the refusal to vaccinate against measles in Ukraine and the consequences of such a choice. The reason for the lack of measles vaccination at the required epidemiological level in Ukraine is not the lack of the necessary vaccines, but the conscious choice of a negative model of behavior by the citizens of the country. The refusal to vaccinate children may be due to a psychological factor caused by the death of a student who was vaccinated against measles on the eve of death. At the same time, the media thirteen years after the event, conducting numerous medical examinations, provides fundamentally contradictory information about the causal relationship between the vaccination of a student against measles and his death. Based on the analysis, it was concluded that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection and severe outcomes caused by viruses. Despite this vaccination coverage against viral infections, seasonal influenza in many countries around the world remains low. Even if a vaccine is available to the citizens of a particular country, but educational programs are not carried out on the need and importance of vaccination, the potential for increasing vaccination rates against viruses will continually diminish. The most common explanation for the current upsurge in vaccine uncertainty is that the Internet enables vaccine deniers to reach out to a wide audience by publicizing their beliefs. Some activists only criticize some vaccines. Such a selective stance may indicate a communication strategy used to promote a particular vaccine. Attention should also be paid to the refusal to vaccinate due to the lack of acceptance by the human mind of traditional medicine, not belief in its effectiveness, the use of alternative, alternative medicine in the treatment of diseases. The reasons for not trusting the vaccination process are highlighted. These include: lack of trust in vaccine manufacturers who are economically motivated to make a profit;not trusting medical institutions that provide vaccinations and the conditions in which vaccines are stored;lack of confidence in government agencies involved in the procurement of vaccines, the possibility of corruption in case of abuse of their powers;fear of disease and side effects due to vaccination;distortion by the media of objective data on vaccination.","Mernyk, A.; Yaroshenko, O.; Inshyn, M.; Lukianov, D.; Hyliaka, O.",Georgian Med News,84,8

It is vital for graduating medical students to learn about COVID-19 because they are likely to treat COVID-19 patients after graduation. We developed a COVID-19 lesson for medical students that used either an online lecture or a serious game that we designed. The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of a serious game versus online lectures for improving medical students' COVID-19 knowledge. Materials and Methods: From our university's database of knowledge scores, we collected the prelesson, postlesson, and final test knowledge scores of the students who participated in the lesson and conducted a retrospective comparative analysis. Results: An analysis of scores concerning knowledge of COVID-19 from prelesson and postlesson tests shows that both teaching methods produce significant increases in short-term knowledge, with no statistical difference between the two methods (P > 0.05). The final test scores, however, show that the group of students who used the game-based computer application scored significantly higher in knowledge retention than did the online lecture group (P = 0.001). Conclusion: In the context of the disruption of traditional university teaching caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the serious game we designed is potentially an effective option for online medical education about COVID-19, particularly in terms of its capacity for improved knowledge retention.","Hu, Hai; Xiao, Yuanyuan; Li, Hao",Games health j.

As COVID-19 case rates decline and state and county restrictions are lifted, facility managers, local and state health agencies are challenged with defining their own policies moving forward to appropriately mitigate disease transmission. The continued emergence of variants of concern has highlighted the need for a readily available tool that can be employed at the facility-level to determine best practices for mitigation and ensure resident and staff safety. To assist leadership in determining the impact of various infection surveillance and response strategies, we developed an agent-based model and an online dashboard interface that simulates COVID-19 infection within congregate care settings under various mitigation measures. In this paper, we demonstrate how this dashboard can be used to quantify the continued risk for COVID-19 infections within a facility given a designated testing schedule and vaccine requirements. Our results highlight the critical nature of testing cadence, test sensitivity and specificity, and the impact of removing asymptomatic infected individuals from the workplace. We also show that monthly surveillance testing at long-term care facilities is unlikely to successfully mitigate SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in congregate care settings.

We describe the performance of ddPCR-in particular, its ability to confirm weak-positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) results. METHODS: We clinically validated the Bio-Rad Triplex Probe ddPCR Assay. The limit of detection was determined by using serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in an artificial viral envelope. The ddPCR assay was performed according to the manufacturer's specifications on specimens confirmed to be positive (nâ =â 48) or negative (nâ =â 30) by an FDA-validated reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay on the m2000 RealTime system (Abbott). Ten borderline positive cases were also evaluated. RESULTS: The limit of detection was 50 copies/mL (19 of 20 positive). Forty-seven specimens spanning a range of quantification cycles (2.9-25.9 cycle numbers) were positive by this assay (47 of 48; 97.9% positive precent agreement), and 30 negative samples were confirmed as negative (30 of 30; 100% negative percent agreement). Nine of 10 borderline cases were positive when tested in triplicate. CONCLUSIONS: The ddPCR of SARS-CoV-2 is an accurate method, with superior sensitivity for viral RNA detection.

Refugee populations in displacement camps live under adverse conditions that are likely to favour the spread of disease. To date, only a few cases of COVID-19 have appeared in refugee camps, and whether feasible non-pharmaceutical interventions can prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in such settings remains untested. METHODS: We constructed the first spatially explicit agent-based model of a COVID-19 outbreak in a refugee camp, and applied it to evaluate feasible non-pharmaceutical interventions. We parameterised the model using published data on the transmission rates and progression dynamics of COVID-19, and demographic and spatial data from Europe's largest refugee camp, the Moria displacement camp on Lesbos, Greece. We simulated COVID-19 epidemics with and without four feasible interventions. RESULTS: Spatial subdivision of the camp ('sectoring') was able to 'flatten the curve', reducing peak infection by up to 70% and delaying peak infection by up to several months. The use of face masks coupled with the efficient isolation of infected individuals reduced the overall incidence of infection, and sometimes averted epidemics altogether. These interventions must be implemented quickly in order to be maximally effective. Lockdowns had only small effects on COVID-19 dynamics. CONCLUSIONS: Agent-based models are powerful tools for forecasting the spread of disease in spatially structured and heterogeneous populations. Our findings suggest that feasible interventions can slow the spread of COVID-19 in a refugee camp setting, and provide an evidence base for camp managers planning intervention strategies. Our model can be modified to study other closed populations at risk from COVID-19 or future epidemics.","Gilman, Robert Tucker; Mahroof-Shaffi, Siyana; Harkensee, Christian; Chamberlain, Andrew T",,84,33

OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of microRNA (miRNA)-10b and serum levels of IL-2 and IL-8 in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 33 COVID-19 patients and 29 healthy subjects. After RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, the transcript level of miR-10b was determined by Real-time PCR. In addition, the serum levels of IL-2 and IL-8 were measured in subjects using ELISA. RESULTS: The patient group comprised of 33 patients with COVID-19 (62.4 ± 3.7 years old), 13 (39%) males and 20 (61%) females. In the control group, 29 subjects (56.6 ± 1.6 years old), 9 (31%) males and 20 (69%) females, were included. The expression of miR-10b was significantly downregulated in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients in comparison to the healthy controls (fold change= 0.12, P< 0.0001). The levels of IL-2 (P< 0.001) and IL-8 (P< 0.001) were significantly increased in the serum samples of COVID-19 patients compared to the healthy subjects. The expression level of miR-10b was correlated significantly with the serum levels of IL-2 and IL-8 as well as with the age of patients, ESR and CRP levels. CONCLUSIONS: miR-10b is downregulated in the COVID-19 patients and might result in increased levels of IL-2 and IL-8, hence contributing to cytokine storm.","Bagheri-Hosseinabadi, Zahra; Ostad Ebrahimi, Hamid; Bahrehmand, Fatemeh; Taghipour, Gholamhosein; Abbasifard, Mitra",Iran J Immunol,84,10

The purpose of this study was to evaluate transmission potential of COVID-19 by examining viral load with respect to time. METHODS: Health care personnel (HCP) at Cleveland Clinic diagnosed with COVID-19, who recovered without needing hospitalization, were identified. Threshold cycle (Ct) for positive PCR tests were obtained and viral loads calculated. Association of viral load with days since symptom onset was examined in a multivariable regression model, which was reduced by stepwise backward selection to only keep variables significant at a level of 0.05. Viral loads by day since symptom onset were predicted using the model and transmission potential evaluated by examination of a viral load-time curve. RESULTS: Over six weeks, 230 HCP had 528 tests performed. Viral loads declined by orders of magnitude within a few days of symptom onset. The only variable significantly associated with viral load was time since onset of symptoms. Of the area under the curve (AUC) spanning symptom onset to 30 days, 96.9% lay within the first 7 days, and 99.7% within 10 days. Findings were very similar when validated using split-sample and 10-fold cross-validation. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with non-severe COVID-19, viral loads in upper respiratory specimens peak by two or three days from symptom onset and decrease rapidly thereafter. The vast majority of the viral load-time AUC lies within 10 days of symptom onset.","Shrestha, Nabin K; Marco Canosa, Francisco; Nowacki, Amy S; Procop, Gary W; Vogel, Sherilynn; Fraser, Thomas G; Erzurum, Serpil C; Terpeluk, Paul; Gordon, Steven M",Clin Infect Dis,84,20

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to phenotype leukocyte subpopulations and the cytokine milieu in the lungs and blood of critically ill patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: We consecutively included patients less than 72 hours after intubation following informed consent from their next of kin. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was evaluated by microscopy; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood were assessed by 10-color flow cytometry and a multiplex cytokine panel. RESULTS: Four mechanically ventilated patients (aged 40-75 years) with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 ARDS were included. Immature neutrophils dominated in both blood and lungs, whereas CD4 and CD8 T-cell lymphopenia was observed in the 2 compartments. However, regulatory T cells and T(H)17 cells were found in higher fractions in the lung. Lung CD4 and CD8 T cells and macrophages expressed an even higher upregulation of activation markers than in blood. A wide range of cytokines were expressed at high levels both in the blood and in the lungs, most notably, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, and monocyte chemoattactant protein-1, consistent with hyperinflammation.

However, data are scarce on the differences in tonsillar virus infections and immune responses between patients with tonsillar hypertrophy or recurrent tonsillitis. We investigated the differences in virus detection and T cell and interferon gene expression in patients undergoing tonsillectomy due to tonsillar hypertrophy or recurrent tonsillitis. METHODS: Tonsils of 89 surgical patients with tonsillar hypertrophy (n = 47) or recurrent tonsillitis (n = 42) were analysed. Patients were carefully characterized clinically. Standard questionnaire was used to asses preceding and allergy symptoms. Respiratory viruses were analysed in tonsils and nasopharynx by PCR. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to analyse intratonsillar gene expressions of IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IL-28, IL-29, IL-37, TGF-β, FOXP3, GATA3, RORC2 and Tbet. RESULTS: Median age of the subjects was 15 years (range 2–60). Patients with tonsillar hypertrophy were younger, smoked less often, had less pollen allergy and had more adenovirus, bocavirus-1, coronavirus and rhinovirus in nasopharynx (all P < 0.05). Only bocavirus-1 was more often detected in hypertrophic tonsils (P < 0.05). In age-adjusted analysis, tonsillar hypertrophy was associated with higher mRNA expressions of IL-37 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Intratonsillar T cell and interferon gene expressions appeared to be relatively stable for both tonsillar hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis. Of the studied cytokines, only newly discovered anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-37, was independently associated with tonsillar hypertrophy showing slightly stronger anti-inflammatory response in these patients.

Unfortunately, access to RNA extraction reagents can represent a bottleneck for quantitative real‐time reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (qRT‐PCR)‐based methodologies, stemming from both extraordinary supply‐chain stresses and the global reach of the virus into resource‐limited settings. To provide flexible diagnostic options for such environments, we report here an “unextracted modification” for qRT‐PCR using the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC's) widely utilized primers/probe sets for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (N1/N2/N3 targeting viral nucleocapsid and RP‐control targeting human RNase P). This approach replaces RNA extraction/purification with a heat‐inactivation step of viral transport media (VTM), followed by direct inoculation—with or without VTM spin concentration—into PCR master mixes. Using derivatives of care from our clinical workflow, we compared traditional and unextracted CDC methodologies. Although some decrease in analytic sensitivity was evident (by higher C (t) values) without extraction, in particular for the N2 primer/probe‐set, we observed high categorical positive agreement between extracted and unextracted results for N1 (unconcentrated VTM‐38/40; concentrated VTM‐39/41), N3 (unconcentrated VTM‐38/40; concentrated VTM‐41/41), and RP (unconcentrated and concentrated VTM‐81/81). The negative categorical agreement for N1/N2/N3 was likewise high. Overall, these results suggest that laboratories could adapt and validate unextracted qRT‐PCR protocols as a contingency to overcome supply limitations, with minimal impact on categorical results.","Adams, Nicholas M.; Leelawong, Mindy; Benton, Alison; Quinn, Criziel; Haselton, Frederick R.; Schmitz, Jonathan E.",J Med Virol,84,29

The aim of this study was to report the effectiveness of an essential-oil extract of three Cretan aromatic plants in the treatment of cases with an upper respiratory tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A double blind randomized controlled trial was implemented between October 2013 and February 2014. An essential-oil extract of Cretan aromatic plants in olive oil (total volume of 15 ml of essential oil per litre of olive oil) was administered as 0.5 ml soft gel capsules, twice a day, for 7 days. Placebo treatment was 0.5 ml olive oil in soft gel capsules. Eligible patients were those presenting for clinical examination in the selected setting with signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection that had begun within the previous 24 hours. Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used for the detection of respiratory viruses. The primary outcome was the severity and duration of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, assessed using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory System Survey (WURSS-21) questionnaire. A secondary outcome of interest was the change in C-reactive protein (CRP) status. RESULTS: One hundred and five patients completed the study: 51 in the placebo group, and 54 in the intervention (treated) group. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. No statistically significant differences were found in symptom duration or severity between the two groups, although small and clinically favorable effects were observed. When the analysis was restricted to subjects with a laboratory-documented viral infection, the percentage of patients with cessation of symptoms after 6 days of treatment was 91% in the intervention group and 70% in the control group (p=0.089). At baseline, one third of the patients in each group had elevated CRP levels. At follow-up, the respective proportions were 0% in the intervention group and 15% in the placebo group (p=0.121). The data were also in a favorable direction when 50% and 80% symptom reduction points were considered for specific virus types. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo the essential-oil extract of three Cretan aromatic plants provided no detectable statistically significant benefit or harm in the patients with upper respiratory illness, although descriptive differences were identified in favorable direction mainly in the virus-positive population.","Duijker, G.; Bertsias, A.; Symvoulakis, E.K.; Moschandreas, J.; Malliaraki, N.; Derdas, S.P.; Tsikalas, G.K.; Katerinopoulos, H.E.; Pirintsos, S.A.; Sourvinos, G.; Castanas, E.; Lionis, C.",J Ethnopharmacol,84,22

With the ongoing struggle across the globe to combat COVID-19 disease, published literature has described the role of kidney disease in COVID-19 patients based on single/multicenter experiences across the globe. We extracted data from observational studies describing comorbid CKD, AKI and CRRT and outcomes and severity of COVID-19-hospitalized patients from December 1, 2019–August 20, 2020 following PRISMA guidelines. Severity of COVID-19 includes intensive care unit admission, oxygen saturation < 90%, invasive mechanical ventilation utilization, in-hospital admission and mortality. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model to calculate pooled estimates, and forest plots were created. In total, 29 studies with 15,017 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. The overall prevalence of AKI was 11.6% [(430/3693)], comorbid CKD 9.7% [(1342/13,728)] and CRRT 2.58% [(102/3946)] in our meta-analysis. We also found higher odds of comorbid CKD (pooled OR: 1.70; 95%CI: 1.21–2.40; p = 0.002), AKI (8.28; 4.42–15.52; p < 0.00001) and utilization of CRRT (16.90; 9.00–31.74; p < 0.00001) in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Conclusion Our meta-analysis suggests that comorbid CKD, AKI and utilization of CRRT were significantly associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Clinicians should focus on early triaging of COVID-19 patients with comorbid CKD and at risk for AKI to prevent complication and mortality.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the appropriate management and compliance to the current guidelines in adults with encephalitis. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective multicenter study at 17 hospitals in the Greater Houston area from August 1, 2008 through September 30, 2017. All cases met the definition for possible or probable encephalitis as per the international encephalitis consortium guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 241 adults (age >17 years) with encephalitis were enrolled. The most common etiologies were unknown (41.9 %), viral (27.8 %) and autoimmune (21.2 %). An adverse clinical outcome was seen in 49 % with 12.4 % in hospital mortality. A high compliance with guidelines (>90 %) was only seen in obtaining a brain computerized tomography (CT) scan, blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) gram stain and culture. A CSF herpes virus simplex (HSV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was done in 84 % and only repeated in 14.2 % of patients with an initial negative result. Furthermore, only two-thirds of patients were started empirically on intravenous acyclovir and antibiotics. Evaluation for other etiologies were not uniformly performed: arboviral serologies (57.3 %), CSF anti-N-Methyl-d-Aspartate Receptor (NMDA) receptor antibody (35.7 %), and CSF varicella zoster virus (VZV) PCR (32 %). The highest yield for the tests were arboviral serologies (42 %), anti-NMDA antibodies (41.2 %) and VZV PCR (16.4 %).

They have been classified as category A pathogens by CDC (centers for disease control and prevention). Hantaviruses pose a serious threat to human health because their infection causes two highly fatal diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). These pathogens are transmitted to humans through aerosolized excreta of their infected rodent hosts. Hantaviruses have a tripartite-segmented negative-sense RNA genome. The three genomic RNA segments, S, M, and L, encode a nucleocapsid protein (N), a precursor glycoprotein that is processed into two envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively. N protein is the major structural component of the virus, its main function is to protect and encapsidate the three genomic RNAs forming three viral ribonucleocapsids. Recent studies have proposed that N in conjunction with RdRp plays important roles in the transcription and replication of viral genome. In addition, N preferentially facilitates the translation of viral mRNA in cells. Glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, play major roles in viral attachment and entry to the host cells, virulence, and assembly and packaging of new virions in infected cells. RdRp functions as RNA replicase and transcriptase to replicate and transcribe the viral RNA and is also thought to have endonuclease activity. Currently, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available for the treatment of hantavirus-associated diseases. Understanding the molecular details of hantavirus life cycle will help in the identification of targets for antiviral therapeutics and in the design of potential antiviral drug for the treatment of HFRS and HCPS. Due to the alarming fatality of hantavirus diseases, development of an effective vaccine against hantaviruses is a necessity.","Hussein, Islam T.M.; Haseeb, Abdul; Haque, Absarul; Mir, Mohammad A.",Adv Appl Microbiol,84,6

During a time of social distancing measures and increasing social isolation, green spaces may be a crucial factor to maintain a physically and socially active lifestyle while not increasing risk of infection. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated whether greenness is related to COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the United States. METHODS: We downloaded data on COVID-19 cases and deaths for each US county up through June 7, 2020, from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center. We used April-May 2020 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, to represent the greenness exposure during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the US. We fitted negative binomial mixed models to evaluate associations of NDVI with COVID-19 incidence and mortality, adjusting for potential confounders such as county-level demographics, epidemic stage, and other environmental factors. We evaluated whether the associations were modified by population density, proportion of Black residents, median home value, and issuance of stay-at-home order. RESULTS: An increase of 0.1 in NDVI was associated with a 6% (95% Confidence Interval: 3%, 10%) decrease in COVID-19 incidence rate after adjustment for potential confounders. Associations with COVID-19 incidence were stronger in counties with high population density and high median home values, and in counties with stay-at-home orders. Greenness was not associated with COVID-19 mortality in all counties; however, it was protective in counties with high percentages of Black residents, high median home value, and higher population density. DISCUSSION: Exposures to NDVI had beneficial impacts on county-level incidence of COVID-19 in the US and may have reduced county-level COVID-19 mortality rates, especially in densely populated counties.","Klompmaker, Jochem O; Hart, Jaime E; Holland, Isabel; Sabath, M Benjamin; Wu, Xiao; Laden, Francine; Dominici, Francesca; James, Peter",medRxiv,84,16

We carried out antibody tests and applied a survey to 1799 individuals; 42% were positive, and diabetes was more prevalent in these cases (p < 0.01).

The most recently identified subset, T(RM) cells, is characterized by the expression of the C-type lectin CD69 and/or the integrin CD103. T(RM) cells persist locally at sites of mucosal tissue, such as the lung, where they provide frontline defense against various pathogens. Importantly, however, T(RM) cells are also involved in shaping the pathology of inflammatory diseases. A number of pioneering studies revealed important roles of CD8(+) T(RM) cells, particularly those in the local control of viral infection. However, the protective function and pathogenic role of CD4(+) T(RM) cells that reside within the mucosal tissue remain largely unknown. In this review, we discuss the ambivalent feature of CD4(+) T(RM) cells in the protective and pathological immune responses. We also review the transcriptional and epigenetic characteristics of CD4(+) T(RM) cells in the lung that have been elucidated by recent technical approaches. A better understanding of the function of CD4(+) T(RM) cells is crucial for the development of both effective vaccination against pathogens and new therapeutic strategies for intractable inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases and chronic allergic diseases.","Hirahara, Kiyoshi; Kokubo, Kota; Aoki, Ami; Kiuchi, Masahiro; Nakayama, Toshinori",Front Immunol,84,1

METHODS: Intervention group was defined as all participants supplemented with vitamin D3 prior to or during COVID-19 (n = 67). Supplements were either bolus vitamin D3 (ie, 50,000IU per month, or 80,000IU or 100,000IU or 200,000IU every 2-3 months), or daily supplementation with 800IU. Comparator group involved those without vitamin D supplements (n = 28). Outcome was 3-month mortality. Covariables were age, sex, functional abilities, history of malignancies, cardiomyopathy, undernutrition, number of acute health issues, antibiotics use, systemic corticosteroids use, and 25(OH)D concentration. RESULTS: 76.1% (n = 51) of participants survived at 3 months in Intervention group, compared to only 53.6% (n = 15) in Comparator group (P = 0.03). The fully-adjusted hazard ratio for 3-month mortality was HR = 0.23[95%CI:0.09;0.58](P = 0.002) in Intervention group compared to Comparator group. Intervention group had also longer survival time (log-rank P = 0.008).

Questions related to infection rates and mechanisms, the possibility of reinfection, and potential therapeutic approaches require us not only to use the experimental models previously employed for the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronaviruses but also to generate new models to respond to urgent questions. DEVELOPMENT: We reviewed the different experimental models used in the study of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in COVID-19 both in different cell lines that have enabled identification of the virus’ action mechanisms and in animal models (mice, rats, hamsters, ferrets, and primates) inoculated with the virus. Specifically, we reviewed models used to assess the presence and effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS, including neural cell lines, animal models such as mouse hepatitis virus CoV (especially the 59 strain), and the use of brain organoids. CONCLUSION: Given the clear need to increase our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, as well as its potential effects on the CNS, we must endeavor to obtain new information with cellular or animal models, with an appropriate resemblance between models and human patients.","Sanclemente-Alaman, Inmaculada; Moreno-Jiménez, Lidia; Benito-Martín, María Soledad; Canales-Aguirre, Alejandro; Matías-Guiu, Jordi A.; Matías-Guiu, Jorge; Gómez-Pinedo, Ulises",Front Immunol,84,1

We previously found that a new neuroprotective drug called NeuroHeal reduced muscle atrophy produced by transient denervation. Aiming to decipher whether NeuroHeal has a direct role in muscle biology, we used herein different models of muscle atrophy: one caused by chronic denervation, another caused by hindlimb immobilization, and lastly, an in vitro model of myotube atrophy with Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNFα). In all these models, we observed that NeuroHeal reduced muscle atrophy and that SIRT1 activation seems to be required for that. The treatment downregulated some critical markers of protein degradation: Muscle Ring Finger 1 (MuRF1), K48 poly-Ub chains, and p62/SQSTM1. Moreover, it seems to restore the autophagy flux associated with denervation.

METHODS: Between 11th and 19th April 2020, all members of a consortium of German colorectal cancer centers were invited to participate in a web-based survey on the current status of surgical care situation of colorectal cancer patients in Germany. RESULTS: A total of 112 colorectal surgeons of 101 German hospitals participated in the survey. Eighty-seven percent of the participating hospitals had to reduce their total surgical caseload and 34% their surgical volume for oncological colorectal patients during COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions of the surgical caseload were independent of the size of the hospital and the number of cases of COVID-19 in the federal state of the hospital. Sixteen percent of colorectal surgeons consider surgical limitations to be not justified and 78% to be justified only if the care of oncological patients is ensured. Ninety-five percent of the colorectal surgeons interviewed stated that all oncological colorectal patients with an indication for surgery should be operated in time, despite the current reservations for COVID-19 patients. For the majority of the respondents (63% and 51%, respectively), an extended waiting time for surgery of up to 2 weeks was acceptable for non-metastatic and metastatic patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: In Germany, there is a temporarily relevant reduction of surgical volume in oncological colorectal patients. Most colorectal surgeons stated that oncological colorectal surgery should not be compromised despite the measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Brunner, Maximilian; Krautz, Christian; Kersting, Stephan; Weber, Georg F.; Stinner, Benno; Benz, Stefan R.; Grützmann, Robert",Int J Colorectal Dis,84,28

Platelets and the coagulation cascade are effectively targeted by antithrombotic approaches, which carry an inherent risk of bleeding. Moreover, antithrombotics cannot completely prevent thrombotic events, implicating a therapeutic gap due to a third, not yet adequately addressed mechanism, namely inflammation. In this Review, we discuss how the synergy between inflammation and thrombosis drives thrombotic diseases. We focus on the huge potential of anti-inflammatory strategies to target cardiovascular pathologies. Findings in the past decade have uncovered a sophisticated connection between innate immunity, platelet activation and coagulation, termed immunothrombosis. Immunothrombosis is an important host defence mechanism to limit systemic spreading of pathogens through the bloodstream. However, the aberrant activation of immunothrombosis in cardiovascular diseases causes myocardial infarction, stroke and venous thromboembolism. The clinical relevance of aberrant immunothrombosis, referred to as thromboinflammation, is supported by the increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with inflammatory diseases but also during infections, including in COVID-19. Clinical trials in the past 4 years have confirmed the anti-ischaemic effects of anti-inflammatory strategies, backing the concept of a prothrombotic function of inflammation. Targeting inflammation to prevent thrombosis leaves haemostasis mainly unaffected, circumventing the risk of bleeding associated with current approaches. Considering the growing number of anti-inflammatory therapies, it is crucial to appreciate their potential in covering therapeutic gaps in cardiovascular diseases.","Stark, Konstantin; Massberg, Steffen",Nat Rev Cardiol,84,24

We aimed to investigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in CD patients. METHODS: CD patients were interviewed about the development of COVID-19 symptoms, compliance with anti-virus measures and adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA (anti-RBD and N proteins) was compared to that in non-CD subjects. Expression of the duodenal ACE2 receptor was investigated. When available, data on duodenal histology, anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTGA), comorbidities and GFD adherence were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 362 CD patients, 42 (12%) reported COVID-19 symptoms and 21% of these symptomatic patients presented anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig. Overall, 18% of CD patients showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig versus 25% of controls (p=0.18). CD patients had significantly lower levels of anti-N IgA. tTGA, duodenal atrophy, GFD adherence or other comorbidities did not influence symptoms and/or antibodies. The ACE2 receptor was detected in the non-atrophic duodenal mucosa of patients; atrophy was associated with lower expression of the ACE2 receptor. CONCLUSION: CD patients have an anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig profile similar to non-celiac controls, except for anti-N IgA. No risk factors were identified among CD parameters and GFD adherence.","Elli, Luca; Facciotti, Federica; Lombardo, Vincenza; Scricciolo, Alice; Sanders, David S.; Vaira, Valentina; Barisani, Donatella; Vecchi, Maurizio; Costantino, Andrea; Scaramella, Lucia; dell'Osso, Bernardo; Doneda, Luisa; Roncoroni, Leda",Dig Liver Dis,84,33

Though this risk is multifactorial, poor glycaemic control before and during admission to hospital for COVID-19 is likely to contribute to the increased risk. The COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions on mobility and interaction can also be expected to impact on daily glucose management of people with diabetes. Telemonitoring of glucose metrics has been widely used during the pandemic in people with diabetes, including adults and children with T1D, allowing an exploration of the impact of COVID-19 inside and outside the hospital setting on glycaemic control. To date, 27 studies including 69,294 individuals with T1D have reported the effect of glycaemic control during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite restricted access to diabetes clinics, glycaemic control has not deteriorated for 25/27 cohorts and improved in 23/27 study groups. Significantly, time in range (TIR) 70–180 mg/dL (3.9–10 mmol/L) increased across 19/27 cohorts with a median 3.3% (− 6.0% to 11.2%) change. Thirty per cent of the cohorts with TIR data reported an average clinically significant TIR improvement of 5% or more, possibly as a consequence of more accurate glucose monitoring and improved connectivity through telemedicine. Periodic consultations using telemedicine enables care of people with diabetes while limiting the need for in-person attendance at diabetes clinics. Reports that sustained hyperglycaemia and early-stage diabetic ketoacidosis may go untreated because of the lockdown and concerns about potential exposure to the risk of infection argue for wider access to glucose telemonitoring. Therefore, in this paper we have critically reviewed reports concerning use of telemonitoring in the acute hospitalized setting as well as during daily diabetes management. Furthermore, we discuss the indications and implications of adopting telemonitoring and telemedicine in the present challenging time, as well as their potential for the future.","Danne, Thomas; Limbert, Catarina; Puig Domingo, Manel; Del Prato, Stefano; Renard, Eric; Choudhary, Pratik; Seibold, Alexander",Diabetes Ther,84,16

Enjoyable home-based exercise programs are greatly needed. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to examine the feasibility of a virtual reality (VR) active video gaming system (ie, bundle of consumer-available equipment) to meet US physical activity guidelines in two youth with SB. METHODS: Two youth with SB—a 12-year-old female and a 13-year-old male; both full-time wheelchair users—participated in a brief, 4-week exercise program using a popular VR head-mounted display: Oculus Quest (Facebook Technologies). The system included a Polar H10 (Polar Canada) Bluetooth heart rate monitor, a no-cost mobile phone app (VR Health Exercise Tracker [Virtual Reality Institute of Health and Exercise]), and 13 games. The intervention protocol was conducted entirely in the homes of the participants due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The VR system was shipped to participants and they were instructed to do their best to complete 60 minutes of moderate-intensity VR exercise per day. Exercise duration, intensity, and calories expended were objectively monitored and recorded during exercise using the heart rate monitor and a mobile app. Fatigue and depression were measured via self-report questionnaires at pre- and postintervention. Participants underwent a semistructured interview with research staff at postintervention. RESULTS: Across the intervention period, the total average minutes of all exercise performed each week for participants 1 and 2 were 281 (SD 93) and 262 (SD 55) minutes, respectively. The total average minutes of moderate-intensity exercise performed per week for participants 1 and 2 were 184 (SD 103) (184/281, 65.4%) and 215 (SD 90) (215/262, 82.1%) minutes, respectively. One participant had a reduction in their depression score, using the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QoL) test, from baseline to postintervention, but no other changes were observed for fatigue and depression scores. Participants reported that the amount of exercise they completed was far higher than what was objectively recorded, due to usability issues with the chest-worn heart rate monitor. Participants noted that they were motivated to exercise due to the enjoyment of the games and VR headset as well as support from a caregiver. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that two youth with SB who used wheelchairs could use a VR system to independently and safely achieve exercise guidelines at home. Study findings identified a promising protocol for promoting exercise in this population and this warrants further examination in future studies with larger samples.","Lai, Byron; Davis, Drew; Narasaki-Jara, Mai; Hopson, Betsy; Powell, Danielle; Gowey, Marissa; Rocque, Brandon G; Rimmer, James H",JMIR Serious Games,84,1

DESIGN: A descriptive literature review was performed. The search of the literature was conducted through using electronic databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Cochrane library. SETTING: A wide range of published articles focused on child malnutrition were reviewed. PARTICIPANTS: The study was focused on children especially those under 5 years. RESULTS: The current study proposes strategic responses to reduce child undernutrition. These responses include strengthening access to community-based nutrition services that support the early detection and treatment of undernourished children and emergency food distribution, including fortified foods with vitamins and minerals, to vulnerable households, particularly those with children under 5 years. Moreover, counseling and promotion programmes should be reinforced to revitalise community nutrition education in areas such as gestation, exclusive breast-feeding and complementary feeding, and hygienic practices involving handwashing, proper sanitation and other basic behavioural changes. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many countries especially those in the regions of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa in which there has been an ongoing burden of child undernutrition. However, malnutrition is preventable and can be eliminated through a multisectoral strategic approach. The effective execution of a multisectoral approach towards preventing childhood malnutrition will require not only a financial investment but also the collective efforts from different ministries of the governments, UN-affiliated agencies and non-governmental organisations.","Ntambara, James; Chu, Minjie",Public health nutrition,84,1

Latent class analysis yielded 8.6% standardized county-wide seroprevalence, a factor of underreported infections of 5.0, and 2.5% overall IFR. Seroprevalence was two-fold higher among medical workers and one third among current smokers with similar proportions of registered infections. While seroprevalence did not show an age-trend, the factor of underreported infections was 12.2 in the young versus 1.7 for ≥85-year-old. Age-specific IFRs were <0.5% below 60 years of age, 1.0% for age 60–69, and 13.2% for age 70+. Senior care homes accounted for 45% of COVID-19-related deaths, reflected by an IFR of 7.5% among individuals aged 70+ and an overall IFR of 1.4% when excluding senior care home residents from our computation. Our data underscore senior care home infections as key determinant of IFR additionally to age, insufficient targeted testing in the young, and the need for further investigations on behavioral or molecular causes of the fewer infections among current smokers.","Wagner, Ralf; Peterhoff, David; Beileke, Stephanie; Günther, Felix; Berr, Melanie; Einhauser, Sebastian; Schütz, Anja; Niller, Hans Helmut; Steininger, Philipp; Knöll, Antje; Tenbusch, Matthias; Maier, Clara; Korn, Klaus; Stark, Klaus J.; Gessner, André; Burkhardt, Ralph; Kabesch, Michael; Schedl, Holger; Küchenhoff, Helmut; Pfahlberg, Annette B.; Heid, Iris M.; Gefeller, Olaf; Überla, Klaus",Viruses,84,24

The biological relevance of amino peptidase N (ANPEP) as a putative receptor for TGEV and PEDV in pigs was evaluated by using CRISPR/Cas9 to edit exon 2 of ANPEP resulting in a premature stop codon. Knockout pigs possessing the null ANPEP phenotype and age matched wild type pigs were challenged with either PEDV or TGEV. Fecal swabs were collected daily from each animal beginning 1 day prior to challenge with PEDV until the termination of the study. The presence of virus nucleic acid was determined by PCR. ANPEP null pigs did not support infection with TGEV, but retained susceptibility to infection with PEDV. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of PEDV reactivity and absence of TGEV reactivity in the enterocytes lining the ileum in ANPEP null pigs. The different receptor requirements for TGEV and PEDV have important implications in the development of new genetic tools for the control of enteric disease in pigs.

We studied the dispersion of exhaled air through a simple oxygen mask applied to a human patient simulator (HPS) during the delivery of different oxygen flow in a room free of air currents. METHODS: The HPS represented a 70-kg adult male individual in a semi-sitting position on a hospital bed inclined at 45°. A simple oxygen mask was fitted to the HPS in the normal fashion. The head, neck, and internal airways of the HPS were configured to allow realistic airflow modeling in the airways and around the face. The HPS was programmed to breathe at a respiratory rate of 14 breaths/min with a tidal volume of 0.5 L. Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke for visualization. A leakage jet plume was revealed by a laser light-sheet, and images were captured by high-resolution video. Smoke concentration in the exhaled plume was estimated from the total light intensity scattered by smoke particles. FINDINGS: A jet plume of air leaked through the side vents of the simple oxygen mask to lateral distances of 0.2, 0.22, 0.3, and 0.4 m from the sagittal plane during the delivery of oxygen at 4, 6, 8, and 10 L/min, respectively. Coughing could extend the dispersion distance beyond 0.4 m. CONCLUSION: Substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs generally within 0.4 m from patients receiving supplemental oxygen via a simple mask. Health-care workers should take precautions when managing patients with community-acquired pneumonia of unknown etiology that is complicated by respiratory failure.","Hui, David S.; Hall, Stephen D.; Chan, Matthew T.V.; Chow, Benny K.; Ng, Susanna S.; Gin, Tony; Sung, Joseph J.Y.",Chest,84,1

Viral DMVs are morphologically analogous to DMVs formed during autophagy, and although the proteins required for DMV formation are extensively studied, the lipids driving their biogenesis are largely unknown. Here we show that production of the lipid phosphatidic acid (PA) by acylglycerolphosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT) 1 and 2 in the ER is important for DMV biogenesis in viral replication and autophagy. Using DMVs in HCV-replicating cells as model, we found that AGPATs are recruited to and critically contribute to HCV replication and DMV formation. AGPAT1/2 double knockout also impaired SARS-CoV-2 replication and the formation of autophagosome-like structures. By using correlative light and electron microscopy, we observed the relocalization of AGPAT proteins to HCV and SARS-CoV-2 induced DMVs. In addition, an intracellular PA sensor accumulated at viral DMV formation sites, consistent with elevated levels of PA in fractions of purified DMVs analyzed by lipidomics. Apart from AGPATs, PA is generated by alternative pathways via phosphotidylcholine (PC) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Pharmacological inhibition of these synthesis pathways also impaired HCV and SARS-CoV-2 replication as well as formation of autophagosome-like DMVs. These data identify PA as an important lipid used for replication organelle formation by HCV and SARS-CoV-2, two phylogenetically disparate viruses causing very different diseases, i.e. chronic liver disease and COVID-19, respectively. In addition, our data argue that host-targeting therapy aiming at PA synthesis pathways might be suitable to attenuate replication of these viruses. One Sentence Summary Phosphatidic acid is important for the formation of double membrane vesicles, serving as replication organelles of hepatitis C virus and SARS-CoV-2, and offering a possible host-targeting strategy to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Tabata, Keisuke; Prasad, Vibhu; Paul, David; Lee, Ji-Young; Pham, Minh-Tu; Twu, Woan-Ing; Neufeldt, Christopher J.; Cortese, Mirko; Cerikan, Berati; Si Tran, Cong; Lüchtenborg, Christian; V’kovski, Philip; Hörmann, Katrin; Müller, André C.; Zitzmann, Carolin; Haselmann, Uta; Beneke, Jürgen; Kaderali, Lars; Erfle, Holger; Thiel, Volker; Lohmann, Volker; Superti-Furga, Giulio; Brügger, Britta; Bartenschlager, Ralf",bioRxiv,84,24

One of the reasons for this major success is better use of big data analytics in efficient contact tracing and management and surveillance of those who require quarantine and isolation. OBJECTIVE: We present here a unique application of big data analytics among Taiwanese people who had contact with more than 3000 passengers that disembarked at Keelung harbor in Taiwan for a 1-day tour on January 31, 2020, 5 days before the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the Diamond Princess cruise ship on February 5, 2020, after an index case was identified on January 20, 2020. METHODS: The smart contact tracing–based mobile sensor data, cross-validated by other big sensor surveillance data, were analyzed by the mobile geopositioning method and rapid analysis to identify 627,386 potential contact-persons. Information on self-monitoring and self-quarantine was provided via SMS, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests were offered for symptomatic contacts. National Health Insurance claims big data were linked, to follow-up on the outcome related to COVID-19 among those who were hospitalized due to pneumonia and advised to undergo screening for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: As of February 29, a total of 67 contacts who were tested by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction were all negative and no confirmed COVID-19 cases were found. Less cases of respiratory syndrome and pneumonia were found after the follow-up of the contact population compared with the general population until March 10, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Big data analytics with smart contact tracing, automated alert messaging for self-restriction, and follow-up of the outcome related to COVID-19 using health insurance data could curtail the resources required for conventional epidemiological contact tracing.","Chen, Chi-Mai; Jyan, Hong-Wei; Chien, Shih-Chieh; Jen, Hsiao-Hsuan; Hsu, Chen-Yang; Lee, Po-Chang; Lee, Chun-Fu; Yang, Yi-Ting; Chen, Meng-Yu; Chen, Li-Sheng; Chen, Hsiu-Hsi; Chan, Chang-Chuan",J Med Internet Res,84,16

We used a FDA-authorized 2-step ELISA protocol developed by the Krammer Lab in combination with at-home self-collection of blood samples using a custom low-cost finger prick-based capillary blood collection kit. Although our survey did not find any COVID-19 seropositive individuals among the OIST cohort, it reliably detected all positive control samples obtained from a local hospital and excluded all negatives controls. Among our controls, we found strong cross-reactivity of antibodies in samples from a serum pool from two MERS patients in the anti-SARS-CoV-2-S ELISA. Here we show that a centralized ELISA in combination with patient-based capillary blood collection using as little as one drop of blood can reliably assess the seroprevalence among communities.

This chemically undefined material known as “lipofuscin,” “ceroid,” or “age pigment” is mainly formed through unregulated and nonspecific oxidative modifications of cellular macromolecules that are induced by highly reactive free radicals. A necessary precondition for reactive free radical generation and lipofuscin formation is the intracellular availability of ferrous iron (Fe(2+)) (“labile iron”), catalyzing the conversion of weak oxidants such as peroxides, to extremely reactive ones like hydroxyl (HO(•)) or alcoxyl (RO(•)) radicals. If the oxidized materials remain unrepaired for extended periods of time, they can be further oxidized to generate ultimate over-oxidized products that are unable to be repaired, degraded, or exocytosed by the relevant cellular systems. Additionally, over-oxidized materials might inactivate cellular protection and repair mechanisms, thus allowing for futile cycles of increasingly rapid lipofuscin accumulation. In this review paper, we present evidence that the modulation of the labile iron pool distribution by nutritional or pharmacological means represents a hitherto unappreciated target for hampering lipofuscin accumulation and cellular ageing.","Barbouti, Alexandra; Lagopati, Nefeli; Veroutis, Dimitris; Goulas, Vlasios; Evangelou, Konstantinos; Kanavaros, Panagiotis; Gorgoulis, Vassilis G.; Galaris, Dimitrios",Antioxidants (Basel),84,1

The epidemic spanned a large geographical extent but clustered in two areas: first in Guangdong Province, and about 3 months later in Beijing with its surrounding areas. Reanalysis of all available epidemiological data resulted in a total of 5327 probable cases of SARS, of whom 343 died. The resulting case fatality ratio (CFR) of 6.4% was less than half of that in other SARS-affected countries or areas, and this difference could only partly be explained by younger age of patients and higher number of community acquired infections. Analysis of the impact of interventions demonstrated that strong political commitment and a centrally coordinated response was the most important factor to control SARS in mainland China, whereas the most stringent control measures were all initiated when the epidemic was already dying down. The long-term economic consequence of the epidemic was limited, much consumption was merely postponed, but for Beijing irrecoverable losses to the tourist sector were considerable. An important finding from a cohort study was that many former SARS patients currently suffer from avascular osteonecrosis, as a consequence of the treatment with corticosteroids during their infection. The SARS epidemic provided valuable information and lessons relevant in controlling outbreaks of newly emerging infectious diseases, and has led to fundamental reforms of the Chinese health system. In particular, a comprehensive nationwide internet-based disease reporting system was established.","Cao, Wu-Chun; de Vlas, Sake J.; Richardus, Jan Hendrik",Infect Dis Rep,84,1

Here, we characterized the cytokine/chemokine expression profiles of immunocompetent patients complicated with ARDS during HAdV infection and identified biomarkers for disease severity/progression. Forty-eight cytokines/chemokines in the plasma samples from 19 HAdV-infected immunocompetent adolescent and adult patients (ten complicated with ARDS) were measured and analyzed in combination with clinical indices. Immunocompetent patients with ARDS caused by severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, 2009 pandemic H1N1 (panH1N1) or bacteria were included for comparative analyses. Similar indices of disease course/progression were found in immunocompetent patients with ARDS caused by HAdV, SARS-CoV-2 or panH1N infections, whereas the HAdV-infected group showed a higher prevalence of viremia, as well as increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK). Expression levels of 33 cytokines/chemokines were increased significantly in HAdV-infected patients with ARDS compared with that in healthy controls, and many of them were also significantly higher than those in SARS-CoV-2-infected and panH1N1-infected patients. Expression of interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-1β, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), monokine induced by IFN-γ (MIG), IL-6, macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), IL-10, IL-1α and IL-2Ra was significantly higher in HAdV-infected patients with ARDS than that in those without ARDS, and negatively associated with the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2)). Analyses of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) showed that expression of IL-10, M-CSF, MIG, HGF, IL-1β, IFN-γ and IL-2Ra could predict the progression of HAdV infection, with the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.944 obtained for IL-10. Of note, the AUC value for the combination of IL-10, IFN-γ, and M-CSF reached 1. In conclusion, the “cytokine storm” occurred during HAdV infection in immunocompetent patients, and expression of IL-10, M-CSF, MIG, HGF, IL-1β, IFN-γ and IL-2Ra was closely associated with disease severity and could predict disease progression.","Li, Jin; Wei, Jinli; Xu, Zhixiang; Jiang, Chunmei; Li, Mianhuan; Chen, Jie; Li, Yanjie; Yang, Minghui; Gu, Yuchen; Wang, Fuxiang; Shu, Yuelong; Yang, Yang; Sun, Litao; Liu, Yingxia",Front Immunol,84,21

Contention and mitigation measures have focused on reducing people’s mass gathering. Such efforts have led to a drop in the economy. The application of a vaccine at a world level represents a grand challenge for humanity, and it is not likely to accomplish even within months. In the meantime, we still need tools to allow the people integration into their regular routines reducing the risk of infection. In this context, this paper presents a solution for crowd management. The aim is to monitor and manage crowd levels in interior places or point-of-interests (POI), particularly shopping centers or stores. The solution is based on a POI recommendation system that suggests the nearest safe options upon request of a particular POI to visit by the user. In this sense, it recommends places near the user location with the least estimated crowd. The recommendation algorithm uses a top-K approach and behavioral game theory to predict the user’s choice and estimate the crowd level for the requested POI. To evaluate the efficiency of this technological intervention in terms of the potential number of contacts of possible COVID-19 infections and the recommendation quality, we have developed an agent-based model (ABM). The adoption level of new technologies can be related to the end-user experience and trust in such technologies. As the end-user follows a recommendation that leads to uncrowded places, both the end-user experience and trust increased. We study and model this process using the OCEAN model of personality. The results from the studied scenarios showed that the proposed solution is widely adopted by the agents, as the trust factor increased from 0.5 (initial set value) to 0.76. In terms of crowd level, these are effectively managed and reduced on average by 40%. The mobility contacts were reduced by 40%, decreasing the risk of COVID-19 infection. An APP has been designed to support the described crowd management and contact tracing functionality. This APP is available on GitHub.","Polanco, Liliana Duran; Siller, Mario",Annu Rev Control,84,22

The greatest diversity of proterodiplostomids is found in crocodilians, although some parasitise snakes and turtles. According to the most recent revision, the Proterodiplostomidae included 17 genera within 5 subfamilies. Despite the complex taxonomic structure of the family, availability of testable morphology-based phylogenetic hypotheses and ancient hosts, molecular phylogenetic analyses of the group were practically lacking. Herein, we use novel DNA sequence data of the nuclear lsrRNA gene and mitochondrial cox1 gene from a broad range of proterodiplostomid taxa obtained from crocodilian, fish, and snake hosts on four continents to test the monophyly of the family and evaluate the present morphology-based classification system of the Proterodiplostomidae in comparison with the molecular phylogeny. This first detailed phylogeny for the Proterodiplostomidae challenges the current systematic framework. Combination of molecular phylogenetic data with examination of freshly collected quality specimens and re-evaluation of morphological criteria resulted in a number of systematic and nomenclatural changes along with a new phylogeny-based classification of the Proterodiplostomidae. As the result of our molecular and morphological analyses: (i) the current subfamily structure of the Proterodiplostomidae is abolished; (ii) three new genera, Paraproterodiplostomum n. g., Neocrocodilicola n. g. and Proteroduboisia n. g., are described and Pseudoneodiplostomoides Yamaguti, 1954 is restored and elevated from subgenus to genus level; (iii) two new species, Paraproterodiplostomum currani n. g., n. sp. and Archaeodiplostomum overstreeti n. sp., are described from the American alligator in Mississippi, USA. Comparison of the structure of terminal ducts of the reproductive system in all proterodiplostomid genera did not support the use of these structures for differentiation among subfamilies (or major clades) within the family, although they proved to be useful for distinguishing among genera and species. Our study includes the first report of proterodiplostomids from Australia and the first evidence of a snake acting as a paratenic host for a proterodiplostomid. A key to proterodiplostomid genera is provided. Questions of proterodiplostomid-host associations parasitic in crocodilians are discussed in connection with their historical biogeography. Our molecular phylogeny of the Proterodiplostomidae closely matches the current molecular phylogeny of crocodilians. Directions for future studies of the Proterodiplostomidae are outlined.

We sought to develop a regional teaching programme with robust quality assurance. Webinars were delivered on a weekly basis by subspecialty experts using Zoom™ augmented with interactive polling software. Trainee feedback comprised Likert item rating on content and delivery, free text comments and self-assessed confidence levels using visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. A focus group was also convened and transcripts assessed with grounded theory analysis. Likert items revealed 442 (93.2%) positive responses regarding content and 642 (96.7%) positive responses regarding trainer delivery. There were statistically significant improvements in VAS scores across all programme content. Key themes from the focus group analysis were the pragmatics of delivering online education, issues surrounding trainer interactivity in the virtual world, the identification of the FRCS as a driving factor and a desire for case-based content and pre-learning of information (the “flipped classroom”). We are continuing to be reactive to trainee feedback in developing our online learning programme which will also include a regional Moodle-based virtual learning environment (VLE), the subject of future educational research in our region.","Elledge, Ross; Williams, Rhodri; Fowell, Christopher; Green, Jason",Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg,84,24

Some diseases such as COVID-19 that causes a pandemic is highly spreadable from an infected person to others. Therefore, providing health services at home for non-critical infected patients with isolation shall assist to mitigate this kind of stress. In addition, this practice is also very useful for monitoring the health-related activities of elders who live at home. The home health monitoring, a continuous monitoring of a patient or elder at home using visual sensors is one such non-intrusive sub-area of health services at home. In this article, we propose a transfer learning-based edge computing method for home health monitoring. Specifically, a pre-trained convolutional neural network-based model can leverage edge devices with a small amount of ground-labeled data and fine-tuning method to train the model. Therefore, on-site computing of visual data captured by RGB, depth, or thermal sensor could be possible in an affordable way. As a result, raw data captured by these types of sensors is not required to be sent outside from home. Therefore, privacy, security, and bandwidth scarcity shall not be issues. Moreover, real-time computing for the above-mentioned purposes shall be possible in an economical way.","Sufian, Abu; You, Changsheng; Dong, Mianxiong",2021 55th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems,84,1

However, macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae has been emerging since about 2000. The Smart Gene(®) system (MIZUHO MEDY Co., Ltd., Tosu, Japan) is a novel fully automated system for detection of pathogens using the method of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with QProbe (QProbe PCR). The entire procedure is completed within 50 min and the size of the instrument is small (15 x 34 x 30 cm). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the Smart Gene(®) system for detection of M. pneumoniae and detection of a point mutation at domain V of the 23S rRNA gene of M. pneumoniae. MATERIALS: Pharyngeal swab samples were collected from 154 patients who were suspected of having respiratory tract infections associated with M. pneumoniae. RESULTS: Compared with the results of qPCR, the sensitivity and specificity of the Smart Gene(®) system were 98.7% (78/79) and 100.0% (75/75), respectively. A point mutation at domain V of the 23S rRNA gene was detected from 7 (9.0%) of 78 M. pneumoniae-positive samples by the Smart Gene(®) system and these results were confirmed by direct sequencing. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of clarithromycin among the 5 isolates of M. pneumoniae with a point mutation at domain V of the 23S rRNA gene were >64 μg/ml and those among the 33 isolates without a mutation in the 23S rRNA gene were <0.0625 μg/ml. CONCLUSION: The Smart Gene(®) system is a rapid and accurate assay for detection of the existence of M. pneumoniae and a point mutation at domain V of the 23S rRNA gene of M. pneumoniae at the same time. The Smart Gene(®) system is suitable for point-of-care testing in both hospital and outpatient settings.","Ishiguro, Nobuhisa; Sato, Rikako; Mori, Toshihiko; Tanaka, Hiroshi; Narita, Mitsuo; Nagano, Takashi; Owaku, Masato; Miyajima, Kensuke; Manabe, Atsushi",PLoS One,84,20

However, despite their increasing use, a theoretically informed understanding of the factors that support and inhibit their effective implementation is severely limited. OBJECTIVE: With this scoping review, we sought to identify the factors that support and inhibit the implementation of electronic consultations in primary care. METHODS: In total, 5 electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO) were systematically searched for studies published in 2009-2019 that explored the impact and/or implementation of electronic consultations in primary care. Database searches were supplemented by reference list and grey literature searches. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis and synthesized using Normalization Process Theory (NPT). RESULTS: In total, 227 articles were initially identified and 13 were included in this review. The main factors found to hinder implementation included awareness and expectations; low levels of engagement; perceived suitability for all patient groups, conditions, and demographics; cost; and other contextual factors. Reports of information technology reliability and clinical workload duplication (as opposed to reduction) also appeared detrimental. Conversely, the development of protocols and guidance; patient and staff education; strategic marketing; and patient and public involvement were all identified as beneficial in facilitating electronic consultation implementation. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the need for proactive engagement with patients and staff to facilitate understanding and awareness, process optimization, and delivery of coherent training and education that maximizes impact and success. Although the necessity to use online methods during the COVID-19 pandemic may have accelerated awareness, concerns over workload duplication and inequality of access may remain. Future research should explore health inequalities in electronic consultations and their economic impacts from multiple perspectives (eg, patient, professional, and commissioner) to determine their potential value. Further work to identify the role of meaningful patient involvement in digital innovation, implementation, and evaluation is also required following the rapid digitization of health and social care.","Baines, Rebecca; Tredinnick-Rowe, John; Jones, Ray; Chatterjee, Arunangsu",J Med Internet Res,84,11

We established a novel rapid neutralization assay, based on reporter cells that become GFP+ after overnight infection. B.1.1.7 was neutralized by 79/83 sera from convalescent patients collected up to 9 months post symptoms, almost similar to D614G. There was a mean 6-fold reduction in titers and even loss of activity against B.1.351 in 40% of convalescent sera after 9 months. Early sera from 19 vaccinated individuals were almost as potent against B.1.1.7 but less efficacious against B.1.351, when compared to D614G. Nasal swabs from vaccine recipients were not neutralizing, except in individuals who were diagnosed COVID-19+ before vaccination.

Concomitantly, such introductions fuel worries about a possible increase in transmissibility and disease severity, as well as a possible decrease in vaccine efficacy. Military personnel are frequently deployed on missions around the world. As part of a COVID-19 risk mitigation strategy, Belgian Armed Forces that engaged in missions and operations abroad were screened (7683 RT-qPCR tests), pre- and post-mission, for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, including the identification of viral lineages. Nine distinct viral genotypes were identified in soldiers returning from operations in Niger, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, and Mali.

As our understanding of the disease is evolving, our approach to the patient management is also changing swiftly. Available new evidence is helping us take radical decisions in COVID-19 management. We searched for inclusion of the published literature on treatment of COVID-19 from around the globe. All relevant evidences available till the time of submission of this article were briefly discussed. Once advised as blanket therapy for all patients, recent reports of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin indicated no potential benefit and use of such combination may increase the risk of arrhythmias. Clinical evidence with newer antivirals such as remdesivir and favipiravir is promising that can hasten the patient recovery and reduce the mortality. With steroids, evidence is much clear in that it should be used in low dose and for short period not extending beyond 7 days in moderate to severe hospitalized patients. Low-molecular-weight heparin should be initiated in all hospitalized COVID-19 patients and dose should be based on the coagulation profile and risk of thromboembolism. Immunomodulatory drugs such tocilizumab may be considered for severe and critically ill patients to improve the outcomes. Though ulinastatin can be a potential alternative immunomodulator, there is lack of clinical evidence on its usage in COVID-19. Convalescent plasma therapy can be potentially lifesaving in critically ill patients. However, there is need to generate further evidence with various such therapies.

The ability to predict which patients may require mechanical ventilation allows increased acuity of care and targeted interventions to potentially mitigate deterioration. METHODS: We included hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in this single-centre retrospective observational study. Our primary outcome was mechanical ventilation or death within 24 h. As clinical decompensation is more recognisable, but less modifiable, as the prediction window shrinks, we also assessed 4, 8, and 48 h prediction windows. Model features included demographic information, laboratory results, comorbidities, medication administration, and vital signs. We created a Random Forest model, and assessed performance using 10-fold cross-validation. The model was compared with models derived from generalised estimating equations using discrimination. RESULTS: Ninety-three (23%) of 398 patients required mechanical ventilation or died within 14 days of admission. The Random Forest model predicted pending mechanical ventilation with good discrimination (C-statistic=0.858; 95% confidence interval, 0.841–0.874), which is comparable with the discrimination of the generalised estimating equation regression. Vitals sign data including SpO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (Random Forest Feature Importance Z-score=8.56), ventilatory frequency (5.97), and heart rate (5.87) had the highest predictive utility. In our highest-risk cohort, the number of patients needed to identify a single new case was 3.2, and for our second quintile it was 5.0. CONCLUSION: Machine learning techniques can be leveraged to improve the ability to predict which patients with COVID-19 are likely to require mechanical ventilation, identifying unrecognised bellwethers and providing insight into the constellation of accompanying signs of respiratory failure in COVID-19.","Douville, Nicholas J.; Douville, Christopher B.; Mentz, Graciela; Mathis, Michael R.; Pancaro, Carlo; Tremper, Kevin K.; Engoren, Milo",Br J Anaesth,84,20

Community surveillance could mitigate delays in reporting, allow for timely collection of respiratory tract samples, and characterize cases of non–medically attended ILI representing substantial personal and economic burden. Text messaging could be utilized to perform longitudinal ILI surveillance in a community-based sample but has not been assessed. We recruited 161 households (789 people) in New York City for a study of mobile ARI/ILI surveillance, and selected reporters received text messages twice weekly inquiring whether anyone in the household was ill. Home visits were conducted to obtain nasal swabs from persons with ARI/ILI. Participants were primarily female, Latino, and publicly insured. During the 44-week period from December 2012 through September 2013, 11,282 text messages were sent. In responses to 8,250 (73.1%) messages, a household reported either that someone was ill or no one was ill; 88.9% of responses were received within 4 hours. Swabs were obtained for 361 of 363 reported ARI/ILI episodes. The median time from symptom onset to nasal swab was 2 days; 65.4% of samples were positive for a respiratory pathogen by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. In summary, text messaging promoted rapid ARI/ILI reporting and specimen collection and could represent a promising approach to timely, community-based surveillance.","Stockwell, Melissa S.; Reed, Carrie; Vargas, Celibell Y.; Camargo, Stewin; Garretson, Aaron F.; Alba, Luis R.; LaRussa, Philip; Finelli, Lyn; Larson, Elaine L.; Saiman, Lisa",Am J Epidemiol,84,26

Using questionnaires completed by participants’ guardians, we examined the relationship between household income and the quality of meals in Japanese schoolchildren before, during, and after the state of emergency. Participants (1111 children, 10–14 years old) were chosen to form a nationally representative sample of the Japanese population. “Well-balanced dietary intake” was defined as the intake of (i) meat, fish, or eggs and (ii) vegetables. The desired prevalence was defined as equal to or more than twice a day. Household income was divided into quartiles. “Well-balanced dietary intake” was lower in all households during the state of emergency compared with before. The proportion of those with a “well-balanced dietary intake” at least twice a day was notably low in both Q3 and Q4 during the state of emergency compared with before the declared state of emergency; relative risk increase (95% CI) were Q1: −19.0% (−19.6% to −18.4%), p < 0.001, Q2: −21.3% (−22.1% to −20.6%) p < 0.001, Q3: −25.4% (−26.1% to −24.7%), p < 0.001, and Q4: −34.8% (−35.6% to −34.0%), p < 0.001. The interaction p (vs. Q1) of Q2, Q3, and Q4 were all <0.001. Guardians from low-income households had significantly higher rates of having less: time, psychological room, and financial position to prepare meals during the state of emergency. Our results suggest that schoolchildren’s quality of meals worsened during the state of emergency, especially in low-income households, because school lunches were not provided.","Horikawa, Chika; Murayama, Nobuko; Kojima, Yui; Tanaka, Hisako; Morisaki, Naho",Nutrients,84,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study involving patients with clinical-epidemiological suspect of COVID-19 infection, who performed CXRs at the emergency department (ED) of our University Hospital from March 1 to March 31, 2020. All patients performed RT-PCR nasopharyngeal and throat swab, CXR at the ED and clinical-epidemiological data. RT-PCR results were considered the reference standard. The final outcome was expressed as discharged or hospitalized patients into a medicine department or intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: Patients that had a RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 infection were 234 in total: 153 males (65.4%) and 81 females (34.6%), with a mean age of 66.04 years (range 18–97 years). Thirteen CXRs were negative for radiological thoracic involvement (5.6%). The following alterations were more commonly observed: 135 patients with lung consolidations (57.7%), 147 (62.8%) with GGO, 55 (23.5%) with nodules and 156 (66.6%) with reticular–nodular opacities. Patients with consolidations and GGO coexistent in the same radiography were 35.5% of total. Peripheral (57.7%) and lower zone distribution (58.5%) were the most common predominance. Moreover, bilateral involvement (69.2%) was most frequent than unilateral one. Baseline CXR sensitivity in our experience is about 67.1%. The most affected patients were especially males in the age group 60–79 years old (45.95%, of which 71.57% males). RALE score was slightly higher in male than in female patients. ANOVA with Games-Howell post hoc showed significant differences of RALE scores for group 1 vs 3 (p < 0.001) and 2 vs 3 (p = 0.001). Inter-reader agreement in assigning RALE score was very good (ICC: 0.92—with 95% confidence interval 0.88–0.95). CONCLUSION: In COVID-19, CXR shows patchy or diffuse reticular–nodular opacities and consolidation, with basal, peripheral and bilateral predominance. In our experience, baseline CXR had a sensitivity of 68.1%. The RALE score can be used in the emergency setting as a quantitative method of the extent of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, correlating with an increased risk of ICU admission.","Cozzi, Diletta; Albanesi, Marco; Cavigli, Edoardo; Moroni, Chiara; Bindi, Alessandra; Luvarà, Silvia; Lucarini, Silvia; Busoni, Simone; Mazzoni, Lorenzo Nicola; Miele, Vittorio",Radiol Med,84,23

METHODS A total of 51 consecutive COVID-19 survivors, mostly healthcare providers, still working in the emergency room and intensive care units of the hospital after the second wave of Covid 19 pandemia were included in this study. Cardiopulmonary exercise stress test was performed. RESULTS The median of the exercise time of the COVID-19 survivors, was 10 (4.5- 13) minutes and the mean 6.8 ± 1.3 Mets was achieved. The V02 max of the COVID-19 survivors was 24 ± 4.6 ml/kg/min which corresponds the 85 ± 10 % of the predicted V02 max value. The VO2WRs value which was reported about 8.5-11 ml/minute per watt in healthy individuals as normal was found lower in Covid 19 survivors (5.6 ± 1.4). The percentage of the maximum peak VO2 calculated according to the predictable peak VO2 of the COVID-19 survivors, was found significantly lower in male patients (92 ± 9.5 % vs 80 ± 8.5 %, p:0.000). Also, there was a positive correlation between the percentage of the maximum predicted VO2 measurements and age. (r: 0.320, p: 0000.) Conclusion: The peak VO2 values of COVID-19 survivors decreased, and simultaneously, their exercise performance decreased due to peripheral muscle involvement.

We aimed to explore the feasibility of these hybrid virtual and physical clinical rounds for PICU patients from the HCWs' perspective. Methods: A mixed quantitative and qualitative deductive thematic content analysis of narrative responses from pediatric intensive care HCWs were analyzed, descriptive statistics were used Results: A total of 31 HCW were included in the analysis; the mean time of the virtual round was 72.45 minutes vs. 34.68 for physical rounds, the most shared component in the virtual round was CXR (93.5%). Some of the HCWs' perceived advantages of the hybrid rounds were enabling the multidisciplinary discussions, lesser round interruptions, and practicality of the virtual discussions. The perceived challenges were the difficulty of the bedside nurse to attend the virtual round, decreased teaching opportunities for the trainees, and decreased interactions among the team members, especially if the video streaming was not utilized. Conclusion: Hybrid virtual and physical clinical rounds in PICU were perceived as feasible by HCWs. The virtual rounds decreased the physical contact between the HCWs, which could decrease the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 spread among the treating team. Still, several components of the hybrid round could be optimized to facilitate the virtual team-members' interactions and enhance the teaching experience.","Temsah, M.-H.; Alhaboob, A.; Abouammoh, N.; Al-Eyadhy, A.; Aljamaan, F.; Alsohime, F.; Alabdulhafid, M.; Ashry, A.; Bukhari, A.; Eltahir, O.; Jamal, A.; Halwani, R.; Alhasan, K.; Al-Tawfiq, J.

Here, we investigated the prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a population living in Veracruz City, Mexico. Methods: From of June 1 to July 31, 2020, the consecutive adult patients that attended 2 ambulatory diagnostic private practice centers for testing were included. Samples were run on the Abbott Architect instrument using the commercial Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. The main outcome was seroprevalence. Demographics, previous infection to SARS-CoV-2 (according to a previous positive polymerase-chain reaction nasopharyngeal swab), self-suspicious of virus of infection (according to have in the previous 4 weeks either fever, headache, respiratory symptoms but not a confirmatory PCR) or no having symptoms were also evaluated. Results: A total of 2174 subjects were tested, included 53.6% women (mean age 41.8, range 18-98 years). One thousand and forty-one (52.5%) subjects were asymptomatic, 722 (33.2%) had suspicious of infection and 311 (14.3%) had previous infection.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, chiropractic programs in every region around the world had to make rapid changes to the delivery of manual therapy technique education, however what those changes looked like was unknown. AIMS: The aims of this study were to describe the immediate actions made by chiropractic programs to deliver education for manual therapy techniques and to summarise the experience of academics who teach manual therapy techniques during the initial outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive approach was used to describe the immediate actions made by chiropractic programs to deliver manual therapy technique education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Chiropractic programs were identified from the webpages of the Councils on Chiropractic Education International and the Council on Chiropractic Education – USA. Between May and June 2020, a convenience sample of academics who lead or teach in manual therapy technique in those programs were invited via email to participate in an online survey with open-ended questions. Responses were entered into the NVivo software program and analysed using a reflexive thematic analysis by a qualitative researcher independent to the data collection. RESULTS: Data from 16 academics in 13 separate chiropractic programs revealed five, interconnected themes: Immediate response; Move to online delivery; Impact on learning and teaching; Additional challenges faced by educators; and Ongoing challenges post lockdown. CONCLUSION: This study used a qualitative descriptive approach to describe how some chiropractic programs immediately responded to the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in their teaching of manual therapy techniques. Chiropractic programs around the world provided their students with rapid, innovative learning strategies, in an attempt to maintain high standards of chiropractic education; however, challenges included maintaining student engagement in an online teaching environment, psychomotor skills acquisition and staff workload.

The current viral pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is in dire need of DAAs. The Main protease (M(pro)) is the focus of extensive structure-based drug design efforts which are mostly covalent inhibitors targeting the catalytic cysteine. ML188 is a non-covalent inhibitor designed to target SARS-CoV-1 M(pro), and provides an initial scaffold for the creation of effective pan-coronavirus inhibitors. In the current study, we found that ML188 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) at 2.5 µM, which is more potent than against SAR-CoV-1 M(pro). We determined the crystal structure of ML188 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) to 2.39 Å resolution. Sharing 96% sequence identity, structural comparison of the two complexes only shows subtle differences.

Individuals from the country at risk of COVID-19 infection have been included in the Korean home-quarantine program, but the efficacy of the program is uncertain. Methods: To estimate the possible number of infected individuals within the large influx of international students from China, we used a deterministic compartmental model for epidemic and performed a simulation-based search of different rates of compliance with home-quarantine. Results: Under the home-quarantine program, the number of the infected individuals would reach 40–72 from 12 March–24 March with the arrival of 0.2% of pre-infectious individuals. Furthermore, the number of isolated individuals would peak at 40–64 from 13 March–27 March in Seoul, South Korea. Our findings indicated when incoming international students showed strict compliance with quarantine, epidemics by the international student from China were less likely to occur in Seoul, South Korea. Conclusions: To mitigate possible epidemics, additional efforts to improve the compliance of home-quarantine of the individuals from countries with the virus risk are warranted along with other containment policies.","Ryu, Sukhyun; Ali, Sheikh Taslim; Lim, Jun-Sik; Chun, Byung Chul",Int J Environ Res Public Health,84,1

Peripheral blood (PB) examination is simple and basic that can be performed in any facility. We aimed to investigate whether PB examination can predict prognosis in coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS Complete blood count (CBC) and PB cell morphology were examined in 38 healthy controls (HCs) and 40 patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19, including 26 mild and 14 severe cases, were hospitalized in Juntendo University Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) between April 1 and August 6, 2020. PB examinations were performed using Sysmex XN-3000 automated hematology analyzer and Sysmex DI-60 employing the convolutional neural network-based automatic image-recognition system. RESULTS Compared with mild cases, severe cases showed a significantly higher incidence of anemia, lymphopenia, and leukocytosis (P < .001). Granular lymphocyte counts were normal or higher in mild cases and persistently decreased in fatal cases. Temporary increase in granular lymphocytes was associated with survival of patients with severe infection. Red cell distribution width was significantly higher in severe cases than in mild cases (P < .001). Neutrophil dysplasia was consistently observed in COVID-19 cases, but not in HCs. Levels of giant neutrophils and toxic granulation/Döhle bodies were increased in severe cases. CONCLUSION Basic PB examination can be useful to predict the prognosis of COVID-19, by detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced multi-lineage changes in blood cell counts and morphological anomalies. These changes were dynamically correlated with disease severity and may be associated with disruption of hematopoiesis and the immunological system due to bone marrow stress in severe infection.","Horiuchi, Yuki; Hayashi, Fumiaki; Iwasaki, Yosuke; Matsuzaki, Akihiko; Nishibe, Kumiko; Kaniyu, Kimiko; Marutani, Setsuko; Saito, Kaori; Matsuoka, Sachiko; Uchihashi, Kinya; Miida, Takashi; Ai, Tomohiko; Tabe, Yoko",International journal of laboratory hematology,84,16

The paper targeted China to investigate whether social structural factors (education level and urban-rural differences) lead to the knowledge gap of COVID-19. Also, this paper examined whether media use, interpersonal communication, public communication, and perceived salience of information can influence the knowledge gap of COVID-19. Furthermore, this paper explored the strategies to promote communication equality. METHODS: An online survey on COVID-19 knowledge and its influencing factors was conducted in February 2020, with a valid sample of 981 participants. The dependent variable was the total score of knowledge related to COVID-19. In addition to demographic variables such as education level and residence, the main explanatory variables include four independent variables: the use of different media (print media, radio, television, Internet), interpersonal communication, public communication, and perceived salience of information. This paper utilized descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and hierarchical multiple regression analysis for data processing. RESULTS: Descriptive statistics indicated that the Internet was the most frequent source of information for participants to obtain COVID-19 knowledge (M = 6.28, SD = 1.022). Bi-variate analysis and regression analysis presented that education level, Internet media use, and perceived salience of information predicted the difference in knowledge level. Hierarchical multiple regression showed that Internet media use significantly predicted differences in the level of knowledge related to COVID-19 among groups with different education levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study found a COVID-19 knowledge gap among the Chinese public, especially the digital knowledge gap. Education level, perceived salience of information, and internet media use can significantly predict the difference in COVID-19 knowledge level. In contrast, the use of traditional media such as newspaper, radio, and television, public communication, and interpersonal communication did not improve knowledge level. Internet media use and education level have an interactive effect on the formation of a COVID-19 knowledge gap. That is, online media use will expand the COVID-19 knowledge gap between groups with different education levels.","Wang, Han; Li, Lina; Wu, Jing; Gao, Hao",BMC Public Health,84,24

Within 2 mo since the outbreak was first reported on December 31, 2019, a total of 566 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS CoV-2) cases have been confirmed in 26 other countries. Travel restrictions and border control measures have been enforced in China and other countries to limit the spread of the outbreak. We estimate the impact of these control measures and investigate the role of the airport travel network on the global spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results show that the daily risk of exporting at least a single SARS CoV-2 case from mainland China via international travel exceeded 95% on January 13, 2020. We found that 779 cases (95% CI: 632 to 967) would have been exported by February 15, 2020 without any border or travel restrictions and that the travel lockdowns enforced by the Chinese government averted 70.5% (95% CI: 68.8 to 72.0%) of these cases. In addition, during the first three and a half weeks of implementation, the travel restrictions decreased the daily rate of exportation by 81.3% (95% CI: 80.5 to 82.1%), on average. At this early stage of the epidemic, reduction in the rate of exportation could delay the importation of cases into cities unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak, buying time to coordinate an appropriate public health response.","Wells, Chad R.; Sah, Pratha; Moghadas, Seyed M.; Pandey, Abhishek; Shoukat, Affan; Wang, Yaning; Wang, Zheng; Meyers, Lauren A.; Singer, Burton H.; Galvani, Alison P.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,84,13

METHODS: Constant, intermittent, and stepping-down SD strategies were modeled at 4 mean magnitudes (5%, 10%, 15% and 20%), 2 time windows (40-days, 80-days), and 2 levels of personal caution (30% and 50%). RESULTS: The stepping-down strategy was the best long-term SD strategy to minimize the peak number of active COVID-19 cases and associated deaths. The stepping-down strategy also resulted in a reduction in total time required to SD over a two-year period by 6.5% compared to an intermittent or constant SD strategy. An 80-day SD time-window was statistically more effective in maintaining control over the COVID-19 pandemic than a 40-day window. However, the results were dependent upon 50% of people being cautious (engaging in personal protection measures). CONCLUSION: If people exercise caution while in public by protecting themselves (e.g., wearing a facemask, proper hand hygiene and avoid agglomeration) the magnitude and duration of SD necessary to maintain control over the pandemic can be reduced. Our models suggest that the most effective way to reduce SD over a two-year period is a stepping-down approach every 80 days. According to our model, this method would prevent a second peak and the number of intensive care units needed per day would be within the threshold of those currently available.","Kennedy, Deanna M.; Zambrano, Gustavo José; Wang, Yiyu; Neto, Osmar Pinto",J Clin Virol,84,1

Understanding the airborne route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is essential for infection prevention and control. In this study, a total of 107 indoor air samples (45 SARS-CoV-2, 62 bacteria, and fungi) were collected from different wards of the Hajar Hospital in Shahrekord, Iran. Simultaneously, bacterial and fungal samples were also collected from the ambient air of hospital yard. Overall, 6 positive air samples were detected in the infectious 1 and infectious 2 wards, intensive care unit (ICU), computed tomography (CT) scan, respiratory patients’ clinic, and personal protective equipment (PPE) room. Also, airborne bacteria and fungi were simultaneously detected in the various wards of the hospital with concentrations ranging from 14 to 106 CFU m(−3) and 18 to 141 CFU m(−3), respectively. The highest mean concentrations of bacteria and fungi were observed in respiratory patients’ clinics and ICU wards, respectively. Significant correlation (p < 0.05) was found between airborne bacterial concentration and the presence of SARS-CoV-2, while no significant correlation was found between fungi concentration and the virus presence. This study provided an additional evidence about the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the indoor air of a hospital that admitted COVID-19 patients. Moreover, it was revealed that the monitoring of microbial quality of indoor air in such hospitals is very important, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, for controlling the nosocomial infections.

COVID-19 related challenges for LGBTQ2S youth experiencing homelessness remain unknown. To address this gap, this study aimed to understand the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on LGBTQ2S youth at risk of, and experiencing, homelessness in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada and surrounding areas. METHODS: Utilizing a mixed-methods convergent parallel design, LGBTQ2S youth experiencing homelessness were recruited to participate in virtual surveys and in-depth one-on-one interviews. Surveys included standardized measures and were administered to measure mental health outcomes and collect information on demographic characteristics, and health service use. Survey data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and statistical tests for difference of proportions. Interviews were analyzed using an iterative thematic content approach. RESULTS: Sixty-one youth completed surveys and 20 youth participated in one-on-one interviews. Quantitative and qualitative data showed that youth have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in various ways, including experiencing poor mental health, such as suicidality, depression, anxiety, and increased substance use, and lack of access to health and social support services. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the need for LGBTQ2S inclusive and affirming health care and support services for precariously housed adolescents to address the pre-existing social and health issues that have been exacerbated by the pandemic.","Abramovich, Alex; Pang, Nelson; Moss, Amanda; Logie, Carmen H.; Chaiton, Michael; Kidd, Sean A.; Hamilton, Hayley A.",PLoS One,84,5

The emergence and spread of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains (MDR-, XDR- and TDR-TB) is the main challenge in global TB-control, requiring the development of novel drugs acting on new biotargets, thus able to overcome the drug-resistance. Tryptanthrin is a natural alkaloid, with great therapeutic potential due to its simple way of synthesis and wide spectrum of biological activities including high bactericidal activity on both drug-susceptible and MDR M. tuberculosis strains. InhA was suggested as the target of tryptanthrins by in silico modeling, making it a promising alternative to isoniazid, able to overcome drug resistance provided by katG mutations. However, neither the mechanism of action of tryptanthrin nor the mechanism of resistance to tryptanthrins was ever confirmed in vitro. We show that the MmpS5-MmpL5 efflux system is able to provide resistance to tryptanthrins using an in-house test-system. Comparative genomic analysis of spontaneous tryptanthrin-resistant M. smegmatis mutants showed that mutations in MSMEG_1963 (EmbR transcriptional regulator) lead to a high-level resistance, while those in MSMEG_5597 (TetR transcriptional regulator) to a low-level one. Mutations in an MFS transporter gene (MSMEG_4427) were also observed, which might be involved in providing a basal level of tryptanthrins-resistance.","Frolova, Svetlana G.; Klimina, Ksenia M.; Kumar, Ravinder; Vatlin, Aleksey A.; Salunke, Deepak B.; Kendrekar, Pravin; Danilenko, Valery N.; Maslov, Dmitry A.",Antibiotics (Basel),84,16
