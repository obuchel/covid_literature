164,164,164,Early transcriptional response in the jejunum of germ-free piglets after oral infection with virulent rotavirus,9.879267,7.4069686,2008-06-04,"Germ-free piglets were orally infected with virulent rotavirus to collect jejunal mucosal scrapings at 12 and 18 hours post infection (two piglets per time point). IFN-gamma mRNA expression was stimulated in the mucosa of all four infected piglets, indicating that they all responded to the rotavirus infection. RNA pools prepared from two infected piglets were used to compare whole mucosal gene expression at 12 and 18 hpi to expression in uninfected germ-free piglets (n = 3) using a porcine intestinal cDNA microarray. Microarray analysis identified 13 down-regulated and 17 up-regulated genes. Northern blot analysis of a selected group of genes confirmed the data of the microarray. Genes were functionally clustered in interferon-regulated genes, proliferation/differentiation genes, apoptosis genes, cytoskeleton genes, signal transduction genes, and enterocyte digestive, absorptive, and transport genes. Down-regulation of the transport gene cluster reflected in part the loss of rotavirus-infected enterocytes from the villous tips. Data mining suggested that several genes were regulated in lower- or mid-villus immature enterocytes and goblet cells, probably to support repair of the damaged epithelial cell layer at the villous tips. Furthermore, up-regulation was observed for IFN-γ induced guanylate binding protein 2, a protein that effectively inhibited VSV and EMCV replication in vitro (Arch Virol 150:1213–1220, 2005). This protein may play a role in the small intestine’s innate defense against enteric viruses like rotavirus.

459,459,459,Development of an optimized RNA-based murine norovirus reverse genetics system,10.0092,7.514883,2010-10-11,"Murine norovirus (MNV), identified in 2003, is the only norovirus which replicates efficiently in tissue culture and as a result has been used extensively as a model for human noroviruses, a major cause of acute gastroenteritis. The current report describes the generation of a new approach to reverse genetics recovery of genetically defined MNV that relies on the transfection of in vitro transcribed capped RNA directly into cells. The use of the recently developed ScriptCap post-transcriptional enzymatic capping system, followed by optimized Neon mediated electroporation of the highly permissive RAW 264.7 cells, resulted in the rapid and robust recovery of infectious MNV. Transfection of cells capable of supporting virus replication but not permissive to virus infection, namely human or hamster kidney cells, also resulted in robust recovery of infectious virus without subsequent amplification by multiple rounds of re-infection. This latter system may provide a reproducible method to measure the specific infectivity of mutant norovirus RNA allowing the accurate quantitation of the effect of mutations on norovirus replication.","Yunus, Muhammad Amir; Chung, Liliane Man Wah; Chaudhry, Yasmin; Bailey, Dalan; Goodfellow, Ian",J Virol Methods,97,1
565,565,565,One-year molecular survey of astrovirus infection in turkeys in Poland,9.789043,7.382945,2011-03-15,"The presence of turkey astrovirus (TAstV) was monitored in meat-type turkey flocks in Poland in 2008. Clinical samples (10 individual faecal swabs/flock) from 77 flocks aged 1-19 weeks were collected from different regions of the country. RT-PCR experiments were performed for detection and molecular characterization of TAstV using four sets of primers within the RdRp gene (ORF1b). The prevalence of astrovirus was 34/77 (44.15%) in the flocks tested. TAstV type 2 was associated with 30 of 77 infections (38.9%), either alone or in mixed infections; TAstV type 1 was detected in 9 of 77 flocks (11.6%), either alone or in mixed infections; ANV was detected only in one flock (1.29%) by sequence analysis during this study. Phylogenetic analysis revealed genetic variability in the TAstV strains that were isolated. Some of Polish TAstV-2 strains were genetically related to the North American isolates; however, most of them formed a distinct subgroup of “European” isolates, suggesting their separate origin or evolution. Additionally, due to the high variability of the TAstV sequences, the most suitable method for TAstV typing seems to be sequencing.","Domanska-Blicharz, Katarzyna; Seroka, Anna; Minta, Zenon",Arch Virol,97,1
576,576,576,Hepatitis B Virus Genotype G forms core-like particles with unique structural properties,9.799418,7.315112,2011-06-11,"SUMMARY: We have determined the structure of the core capsid of an unusual variant of hepatitis B virus, genotype G (HBV/G) at 14 Å resolution, using cryo-electron microscopy. The structure reveals surface features not present in the prototype HBV/A genotype. HBV/G is novel in that it has a unique 36- bp insertion downstream of the core gene start codon. This results in a twelve amino acid insertion at the N-terminal end of the core protein, and two stop codons in the precore region that prevent the expression of HBeAg. HBV/G replication in patients is associated with co-infection with another genotype of HBV, suggesting that HBV/G may have reduced replication efficiency in vivo. We localized the N-terminal insertion in HBV/G and show that it forms two additional masses on the core surface adjacent to each of the dimer-spikes and have modelled the structure of the additional residues within this density. We show that the position of the insertion would not interfere with translocation of nucleic acids through the pores to the core interior compartment. However, the insertion may partially obscure several residues on the core surface that are known to play a role in envelopment and secretion of virions, or that could affect structural rearrangements that may trigger envelopment after DNA second-strand synthesis.","Cotelesage, J J H; Osiowy, C; Lawrence, C; deVarennes, S L; Teow, S; Beniac, D R; Booth, T F",J Viral Hepat,97,28
587,587,587,Programmed Death (PD)-1-Deficient Mice Are Extremely Sensitive to Murine Hepatitis Virus Strain-3 (MHV-3) Infection,9.734369,7.682155,2011-07-07,"The inhibitory receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1) has the capacity to maintain peripheral tolerance and limit immunopathological damage; however, its precise role in fulminant viral hepatitis (FH) has yet to be described. Here, we investigated the functional mechanisms of PD-1 as related to FH pathogenesis induced by the murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3). High levels of PD-1-positive CD4(+), CD8(+) T cells, NK cells and macrophages were observed in liver, spleen, lymph node and thymus tissues following MHV-3 infection. PD-1-deficient mice exhibited significantly higher expression of the effector molecule which initiates fibrinogen deposition, fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2), than did their wild-type (WT) littermates. As a result, more severe tissue damage was produced and mortality rates were higher. Fluorescence double-staining revealed that FGL2 and PD-1 were not co-expressed on the same cells, while quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that higher levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α mRNA transcription occurred in PD-1-deficient mice in response to MHV-3 infection. Conversely, in vivo blockade of IFN-γ and TNF-α led to efficient inhibition of FGL2 expression, greatly attenuated the development of tissue lesions, and ultimately reduced mortality. Thus, the up-regulation of FGL2 in PD-1-deficient mice was determined to be mediated by IFN-γ and TNF-α. Taken together, our results suggest that PD-1 signaling plays an essential role in decreasing the immunopathological damage induced by MHV-3 and that manipulation of this signal might be a useful strategy for FH immunotherapy.","Chen, Yongwen; Wu, Shengxi; Guo, Guoning; Fei, Lei; Guo, Sheng; Yang, Chengying; Fu, Xiaolan; Wu, Yuzhang",PLoS Pathog,97,28
620,620,620,"Systematic Identification of Novel, Essential Host Genes Affecting Bromovirus RNA Replication",9.848411,7.261603,2011-08-22,"Positive-strand RNA virus replication involves viral proteins and cellular proteins at nearly every replication step. Brome mosaic virus (BMV) is a well-established model for dissecting virus-host interactions and is one of very few viruses whose RNA replication, gene expression and encapsidation have been reproduced in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previously, our laboratory identified ∼100 non-essential host genes whose loss inhibited or enhanced BMV replication at least 3-fold. However, our isolation of additional BMV-modulating host genes by classical genetics and other results underscore that genes essential for cell growth also contribute to BMV RNA replication at a frequency that may be greater than that of non-essential genes. To systematically identify novel, essential host genes affecting BMV RNA replication, we tested a collection of ∼900 yeast strains, each with a single essential gene promoter replaced by a doxycycline-repressible promoter, allowing repression of gene expression by adding doxycycline to the growth medium. Using this strain array of ∼81% of essential yeast genes, we identified 24 essential host genes whose depleted expression reproducibly inhibited or enhanced BMV RNA replication. Relevant host genes are involved in ribosome biosynthesis, cell cycle regulation and protein homeostasis, among other cellular processes. BMV 2a(Pol) levels were significantly increased in strains depleted for a heat shock protein (HSF1) or proteasome components (PRE1 and RPT6), suggesting these genes may affect BMV RNA replication by directly or indirectly modulating 2a(Pol) localization, post-translational modification or interacting partners. Investigating the diverse functions of these newly identified essential host genes should advance our understanding of BMV-host interactions and normal cellular pathways, and suggest new modes of virus control.","Gancarz, Brandi L.; Hao, Linhui; He, Qiuling; Newton, Michael A.; Ahlquist, Paul",PLoS One,97,1
689,689,689,Persistent Expression of Hepatitis C Virus Non-Structural Proteins Leads to Increased Autophagy and Mitochondrial Injury in Human Hepatoma Cells,9.813945,7.351161,2011-12-02,"HCV infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease and liver cancer in the United States. To address the pathogenesis caused by HCV infection, recent studies have focused on the direct cytopathic effects of individual HCV proteins, with the objective of identifying their specific roles in the overall pathogenesis. However, this approach precludes examination of the possible interactions between different HCV proteins and organelles. To obtain a better understanding of the various cytopathic effects of and cellular responses to HCV proteins, we used human hepatoma cells constitutively replicating HCV RNA encoding either the full-length polyprotein or the non-structural proteins, or cells constitutively expressing the structural protein core, to model the state of persistent HCV infection and examined the combination of various HCV proteins in cellular pathogenesis. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in the mitochondria, mitochondrial injury and degeneration, and increased lipid accumulation were common among all HCV protein-expressing cells regardless of whether they expressed the structural or non-structural proteins. Expression of the non-structural proteins also led to increased oxidative stress in the cytosol, membrane blebbing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and accumulation of autophagocytic vacuoles. Alterations of cellular redox state, on the other hand, significantly changed the level of autophagy, suggesting a direct link between oxidative stress and HCV-mediated activation of autophagy. With the wide-spread cytopathic effects, cells with the full-length HCV polyprotein showed a modest antioxidant response and exhibited a significant increase in population doubling time and a concomitant decrease in cyclin D1. In contrast, cells expressing the non-structural proteins were able to launch a vigorous antioxidant response with up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes. The population doubling time and cyclin D1 level were also comparable to that of control cells. Finally, the cytopathic effects of core protein appeared to focus on the mitochondria without remarkable disturbances in the cytosol.","Chu, Victor C.; Bhattacharya, Sayanti; Nomoto, Ann; Lin, Jiahui; Zaidi, Syed Kashif; Oberley, Terry D.; Weinman, Steven A.; Azhar, Salman; Huang, Ting-Ting",PLoS One,97,28
715,715,715,Identification and Characterization of a Novel Non-Structural Protein of Bluetongue Virus,10.018742,7.3146944,2011-12-29,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) is the causative agent of a major disease of livestock (bluetongue). For over two decades, it has been widely accepted that the 10 segments of the dsRNA genome of BTV encode for 7 structural and 3 non-structural proteins. The non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2, NS3/NS3a) play different key roles during the viral replication cycle. In this study we show that BTV expresses a fourth non-structural protein (that we designated NS4) encoded by an open reading frame in segment 9 overlapping the open reading frame encoding VP6. NS4 is 77–79 amino acid residues in length and highly conserved among several BTV serotypes/strains. NS4 was expressed early post-infection and localized in the nucleoli of BTV infected cells. By reverse genetics, we showed that NS4 is dispensable for BTV replication in vitro, both in mammalian and insect cells, and does not affect viral virulence in murine models of bluetongue infection. Interestingly, NS4 conferred a replication advantage to BTV-8, but not to BTV-1, in cells in an interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral state. However, the BTV-1 NS4 conferred a replication advantage both to a BTV-8 reassortant containing the entire segment 9 of BTV-1 and to a BTV-8 mutant with the NS4 identical to the homologous BTV-1 protein. Collectively, this study suggests that NS4 plays an important role in virus-host interaction and is one of the mechanisms played, at least by BTV-8, to counteract the antiviral response of the host. In addition, the distinct nucleolar localization of NS4, being expressed by a virus that replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm, offers new avenues to investigate the multiple roles played by the nucleolus in the biology of the cell.","Ratinier, Maxime; Caporale, Marco; Golder, Matthew; Franzoni, Giulia; Allan, Kathryn; Nunes, Sandro Filipe; Armezzani, Alessia; Bayoumy, Amr; Rixon, Frazer; Shaw, Andrew; Palmarini, Massimo",PLoS Pathog,97,28
769,769,769,Placement of Leucine Zipper Motifs at the Carboxyl Terminus of HIV-1 Protease Significantly Reduces Virion Production,9.950528,7.7027516,2012-03-01,"Natural HIV-1 protease (PR) is homodimeric. Some researchers believe that interactions between HIV-1 Gag-Pol molecules trigger the activation of embedded PR (which mediates Gag and Gag-Pol cleavage), and that Gag-Pol assembly domains outside of PR may contribute to PR activation by influencing PR dimer interaction in a Gag-Pol context. To determine if the enhancement of PR dimer interaction facilitates PR activation, we placed single or tandem repeat leucine zippers (LZ) at the PR C-terminus, and looked for a correlation between enhanced Gag processing efficiency and increased Gag-PR-LZ multimerization capacity. We found significant reductions in virus-like particles (VLPs) produced by HIV-1 mutants, with LZ fused to the end of PR as a result of enhanced Gag cleavage efficiency. Since VLP production can be restored to wt levels following PR activity inhibition, this assembly defect is considered PR activity-dependent. We also found a correlation between the LZ enhancement effect on Gag cleavage and enhanced Gag-PR multimerization. The results suggest that PR dimer interactions facilitated by forced Gag-PR multimerization lead to premature Gag cleavage, likely a result of premature PR activation. Our conclusion is that placement of a heterologous dimerization domain downstream of PR enhances PR-mediated Gag cleavage efficiency, implying that structural conformation, rather than the primary sequence outside of PR, is a major determinant of HIV-1 PR activation.","Pan, Yen-Yu; Wang, Shiu-Mei; Huang, Kuo-Jung; Chiang, Chien-Cheng; Wang, Chin-Tien",PLoS One,97,1
799,799,799,Membrane Fusion and Cell Entry of XMRV Are pH-Independent and Modulated by the Envelope Glycoprotein's Cytoplasmic Tail,10.173974,7.2959433,2012-03-27,"Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) is a gammaretrovirus that was originally identified from human prostate cancer patients and subsequently linked to chronic fatigue syndrome. Recent studies showed that XMRV is a recombinant mouse retrovirus; hence, its association with human diseases has become questionable. Here, we demonstrated that XMRV envelope (Env)-mediated pseudoviral infection is not blocked by lysosomotropic agents and cellular protease inhibitors, suggesting that XMRV entry is not pH-dependent. The full length XMRV Env was unable to induce syncytia formation and cell-cell fusion, even in cells overexpressing the viral receptor, XPR1. However, truncation of the C-terminal 21 or 33 amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of XMRV Env induced substantial membrane fusion, not only in the permissive 293 cells but also in the nonpermissive CHO cells that lack a functional XPR1 receptor. The increased fusion activities of these truncations correlated with their enhanced SU shedding into culture media, suggesting conformational changes in the ectodomain of XMRV Env. Noticeably, further truncation of the CT of XMRV Env proximal to the membrane-spanning domain severely impaired the Env fusogenicity, as well as dramatically decreased the Env incorporations into MoMLV oncoretroviral and HIV-1 lentiviral vectors resulting in greatly reduced viral transductions. Collectively, our studies reveal that XMRV entry does not require a low pH or low pH-dependent host proteases, and that the cytoplasmic tail of XMRV Env critically modulates membrane fusion and cell entry. Our data also imply that additional cellular factors besides XPR1 are likely to be involved in XMRV entry.","Côté, Marceline; Zheng, Yi-Min; Liu, Shan-Lu",PLoS One,97,8
957,957,957,Acute Reactogenicity after Intramuscular Immunization with Recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Is Linked to Production of IL-1β,10.142118,7.413374,2012-10-08,"Vaccines based on live viruses are attractive because they are immunogenic, cost-effective, and can be delivered by multiple routes. However, live virus vaccines also cause reactogenic side effects such as fever, myalgia, and injection site pain that have reduced their acceptance in the clinic. Several recent studies have linked vaccine-induced reactogenic side effects to production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in humans. Our objective was therefore to determine whether IL-1β contributed to pathology after immunization with recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vaccine vectors, and if so, to identify strategies by which IL-1β mediated pathology might be reduced without compromising immunogenicity. We found that an rVSV vaccine induced local and systemic production of IL-1β in vivo, and that accumulation of IL-1β correlated with acute pathology after rVSV immunization. rVSV-induced pathology was reduced in mice deficient in the IL-1 receptor Type I, but the IL-1R−/− mice were fully protected from lethal rechallenge with a high dose of VSV. This result demonstrated that IL-1 contributed to reactogenicity of the rVSV, but was dispensable for induction of protective immunity. The amount of IL-1β detected in mice deficient in either caspase-1 or the inflammasome adaptor molecule ASC after rVSV immunization was not significantly different than that produced by wild type animals, and caspase-1−/− and ASC−/− mice were only partially protected from rVSV-induced pathology. Those data support the idea that some of the IL-1β expressed in vivo in response to VSV may be activated by a caspase-1 and ASC-independent mechanism. Together these results suggest that rVSV vectors engineered to suppress the induction of IL-1β, or signaling through the IL-1R would be less reactogenic in vivo, but would retain their immunogenicity and protective capacity. Such rVSV would be highly desirable as either vaccine vectors or oncolytic therapies, and would likely be better tolerated in human vaccinees.","Athearn, Kathleen; Sample, Christopher J.; Barefoot, Brice E.; Williams, Kristi L.; Ramsburg, Elizabeth A.",PLoS One,97,28

B-cell epitopes on the gp90 protein of REV have not been well studied and reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study describes the identification of a linear B-cell epitope on the gp90 protein by screening a phage-displayed 12-mer random peptide library with the neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) A9E8 directed against the gp90. The mAb A9E8 recognized phages displaying peptides with the consensus motif SVQYHPL. Amino acid sequence of the motif exactly matched (213)SVQYHPL(219) of the gp90. Further identification of the displayed B cell epitope was conducted using a set of truncated peptides expressed as GST fusion proteins and the Western blot results indicated that (213)SVQYHPL(219) was the minimal determinant of the linear B cell epitope recognized by the mAb A9E8. Moreover, an eight amino acid peptide SVQYHPLA was proven to be the minimal unit of the epitope with the maximal binding activity to mAb A9E8. The REV-A-positive chicken serum reacted with the minimal linear epitopes in Western blot, revealing the importance of the eight amino acids of the epitope in antibody-epitope binding activity. Furthermore, we found that the epitope is a common motif shared among REV-A and other members of REV group. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: We identified (213)SVQYHPL(219) as a gp90-specific linear B-cell epitope recognized by the neutralizing mAb A9E8. The results in this study may have potential applications in development of diagnostic techniques and epitope-based marker vaccines against REV-A and other viruses of the REV group.","Xue, Mei; Shi, Xingming; Zhang, Jing; Zhao, Yan; Cui, Hongyu; Hu, Shunlei; Gao, Hongbo; Cui, Xianlan; Wang, Yun-Feng",PLoS One,97,28

Swine influenza is generally characterized by acute onset of fever and respiratory symptoms. The most frequent complications of influenza are secondary bacterial pneumonia. The objective of this work was to study the acute phase proteins (APP) responses after coinfection of piglets with H1N1 swine influenza virus (SwH1N1) and Pasteurella multocida (Pm) in order to identify whether the individual APP response correlate with disease severity and whether APP could be used as markers of the health status of coinfected pigs. RESULTS: In all coinfected pigs clinical sings, including fever, coughing and dyspnea, were seen. Viral shedding was observed from 2 to 7 dpi. The mean level of antibodies against Pm dermonecrotoxin in infected piglets increase significantly from 7 dpi. Anti-SwH1N1 antibodies in the serum were detected from 7 dpi. The concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) increased significantly at 1 dpi as compared to control pigs, and remained significantly higher to 3 dpi. Level of serum amyloid A (SAA) was significantly higher from 2 to 3 dpi. Haptoglobin (Hp) was significantly elevated from 3 dpi to the end of study, while pig major acute phase protein (Pig-MAP) from 3 to 7 dpi. The concentrations of CRP, Hp and SAA significantly increased before specific antibodies were detected. Positive correlations were found between serum concentration of Hp and SAA and lung scores, and between clinical score and concentrations of Pig-MAP and SAA. CONCLUSIONS: The results of current study confirmed that monitoring of APP may revealed ongoing infection, and in this way may be useful in selecting clinically healthy pigs (i.e. before integration into an uninfected herd). Present results corroborated our previous findings that SAA could be a potentially useful indicator in experimental infection studies (e.g. vaccine efficiency investigations) or as a marker for disease severity, because of correlation observed between its concentration in serum and disease severity (lung scores, clinical scores).","Pomorska-Mól, Małgorzata; Markowska-Daniel, Iwona; Kwit, Krzysztof; Stępniewska, Katarzyna; Pejsak, Zygmunt",BMC Vet Res,97,28

We generated Huh-7-derived cell lines resistant to brefeldin A (BFA), which is an inhibitor of this pathway. The resistant cell lines could be sorted into two phenotypes regarding BFA-induced toxicity, inhibition of albumin secretion, and inhibition of HCV infection. Two cell lines were more than 100 times more resistant to BFA than the parental Huh-7 cells in these 3 assays. This resistant phenotype was correlated with the presence of a point mutation in the Sec7 domain of GBF1, which is known to impair the binding of BFA. Surprisingly, the morphology of the cis-Golgi of these cells remained sensitive to BFA at concentrations of the drug that allowed albumin secretion, indicating a dichotomy between the phenotypes of secretion and Golgi morphology. Cells of the second group were about 10 times more resistant than parental Huh-7 cells to the BFA-induced toxicity. The EC(50) for albumin secretion was only 1.5–1.8 fold higher in these cells than in Huh-7 cells. However their level of secretion in the presence of inhibitory doses of BFA was 5 to 15 times higher. Despite this partially effective secretory pathway in the presence of BFA, the HCV infection was almost as sensitive to BFA as in Huh-7 cells. This suggests that the function of GBF1 in HCV replication does not simply reflect its role of regulator of the secretory pathway of the host cell. Thus, our results confirm the involvement of GBF1 in HCV replication, and suggest that GBF1 might fulfill another function, in addition to the regulation of the secretory pathway, during HCV replication.","Farhat, Rayan; Goueslain, Lucie; Wychowski, Czeslaw; Belouzard, Sandrine; Fénéant, Lucie; Jackson, Catherine L.; Dubuisson, Jean; Rouillé, Yves",PLoS One,97,28

As docking ambitions grow to include new scoring function terms, and to address ever more targets, the reliability and extendability of the orientation sampling, and the throughput of the method, become pressing. Here we explore sampling techniques that eliminate stochastic behavior in DOCK3.6, allowing us to optimize the method for regularly variable sampling of orientations. This also enabled a focused effort to optimize the code for efficiency, with a three-fold increase in the speed of the program. This, in turn, facilitated extensive testing of the method on the 102 targets, 22,805 ligands and 1,411,214 decoys of the Directory of Useful Decoys - Enhanced (DUD-E) benchmarking set, at multiple levels of sampling. Encouragingly, we observe that as sampling increases from 50 to 500 to 2000 to 5000 to 20000 molecular orientations in the binding site (and so from about 1×10(10) to 4×10(10) to 1×10(11) to 2×10(11) to 5×10(11) mean atoms scored per target, since multiple conformations are sampled per orientation), the enrichment of ligands over decoys monotonically increases for most DUD-E targets. Meanwhile, including internal electrostatics in the evaluation ligand conformational energies, and restricting aromatic hydroxyls to low energy rotamers, further improved enrichment values. Several of the strategies used here to improve the efficiency of the code are broadly applicable in the field.","Coleman, Ryan G.; Carchia, Michael; Sterling, Teague; Irwin, John J.; Shoichet, Brian K.",PLoS One,97,1

After biosynthesis E protein forms a heterodimer with precursor membrane (prM) protein. Recent reports of infection enhancement by anti-prM monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) suggest anti-prM responses could be potentially harmful. Previously, we studied a series of C-terminal truncation constructs expressing DENV type 4 prM/E or E proteins and found the ectodomain of E protein alone could be recognized by all 12 mAbs tested, suggesting E protein ectodomain as a potential subunit immunogen without inducing anti-prM response. The characteristics of DENV E protein ectodomain in the absence of prM protein remains largely unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we investigated the expression, membrane association, glycosylation pattern, secretion and particle formation of E protein ectodomain of DENV4 in the presence or absence of prM protein. E protein ectodomain associated with membrane in or beyond trans-Golgi and contained primarily complex glycans, whereas full-length E protein associated with ER membrane and contained high mannose glycans. In the absence of prM protein, E protein ectodomain can secrete as well as form particles of approximately 49 nm in diameter, as revealed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation with or without detergent and electron microscopy. Mutational analysis revealed that the secretion of E protein ectodomain was affected by N-linked glycosylation and could be restored by treatment with ammonia chloride. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Considering the enhancement of DENV infectivity by anti-prM antibodies, our findings provide new insights into the expression and secretion of E protein ectodomain in the absence of prM protein and contribute to future subunit vaccine design.","Hsieh, Szu-Chia; Tsai, Wen-Yang; Nerurkar, Vivek R.; Wang, Wei-Kung",PLoS One,97,28

To highlight the different membrane-active regions of NS2A, we characterized the effects of peptides derived from a peptide library encompassing this protein’s full length on different membranes by measuring their membrane leakage induction and modulation of lipid phase behavior. Following this initial screening, one region, peptide dens25, had interesting effects on membranes; therefore, we sought to thoroughly characterize this region’s interaction with membranes.

We show that dens25 strongly interacts with membranes that contain a large proportion of lipid molecules with a formal negative charge, and that this effect has a major electrostatic contribution. Considering its membrane modulating capabilities, this region might be involved in membrane rearrangements and thus be important for the viral cycle.","Nemésio, Henrique; Villalaín, José",J Phys Chem B,97,28
1615,1615,1615,Integrin β3 Is Required in Infection and Proliferation of Classical Swine Fever Virus,10.057094,7.267298,2014-10-23,"Classical Swine Fever (CSF) is a highly infectious fatal pig disease, resulting in huge economic loss to the swine industry. Integrins are membrane-bound signal mediators, expressed on a variety of cell surfaces and are known as receptors or co-receptors for many viruses. However, the role of integrin β3 in CSFV infection is unknown. Here, through quantitive PCR, immunofluorescence (IFC) and immunocytohistochemistry (ICC), we revealed that ST (swine testicles epithelial) cells have a prominent advantage in CSFV proliferation as compared to EC (swine umbilical vein endothelial cell), IEC (swine intestinal epithelial cell) and PK (porcine kidney epithelial) cells. Meanwhile, ST cells had remarkably more integrin β3 expression as compared to EC, IEC and PK cells, which was positively correlated with CSFV infection and proliferation. Integrin β3 was up-regulated post CSFV infection in all the four cell lines, while the CSFV proliferation rate was decreased in integrin β3 function-blocked cells. ShRNA1755 dramatically decreased integrin β3, with a deficiency of 96% at the mRNA level and 80% at the protein level. CSFV proliferation was dramatically reduced in integrin β3 constantly-defected cells (ICDC), with the deficiencies of 92.6%, 99% and 81.7% at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h post CSFV infection, respectively. These results demonstrate that integrin β3 is required in CSFV infection and proliferation, which provide a new insight into the mechanism of CSFV infection.","Li, Weiwei; Wang, Gang; Liang, Wulong; Kang, Kai; Guo, Kangkang; Zhang, Yanming",PLoS One,97,28

NFV has also been shown to have in vitro inhibitory activity against human herpesviruses (HHVs). Given the apparent absence of an aspartyl protease encoded by HHVs, we investigated the mechanism of action of NFV herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in cultured cells. Selection of HSV-1 resistance to NFV was not achieved despite multiple passages under drug pressure. NFV did not significantly affect the level of expression of late HSV-1 gene products. Normal numbers of viral particles appeared to be produced in NFV-treated cells by electron microscopy but remain within the cytoplasm more often than controls. NFV did not inhibit the activity of the HSV-1 serine protease nor could its antiviral activity be attributed to inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. NFV was found to decrease glycosylation of viral glycoproteins B and C and resulted in aberrant subcellular localization, consistent with induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response by NFV. These results demonstrate that NFV causes alterations in HSV-1 glycoprotein maturation and egress and likely acts on one or more host cell functions that are important for HHV replication.","Gantt, Soren; Gachelet, Eliora; Carlsson, Jacquelyn; Barcy, Serge; Casper, Corey; Lagunoff, Michael",Adv Virol,97,28

The IBDV genome is formed by two dsRNA segments. The largest one harbors two partially overlapping open reading frames encoding a non-structural polypeptide, known as VP5, and a large polyprotein, respectively. VP5 is non-essential for virus replication. However, it plays a major role in IBDV pathogenesis. VP5 accumulates at the plasma membrane (PM) of IBDV-infected cells. We have analyzed the mechanism underlying the VP5 PM targeting. Updated topological prediction algorithm servers fail to identify a transmembrane domain within the VP5 sequence. However, the VP5 polycationic C-terminal region, harboring three closely spaced patches formed by two or three consecutive basic amino acid residues (lysine or arginine), might account for its PM tropism. We have found that mutations, either C-terminal VP5 deletions or replacement of basic amino acids by alanine residues, that reduce the electropositive charge of the VP5 C-terminus abolish PM targeting. Lipid overlay assays performed with an affinity-purified Flag-tagged VP5 (FVP5) protein version show that this polypeptide binds several phosphoinositides (PIP), exhibiting a clear preference for monophosphate species. Experiments performed with FVP5 mutant proteins lacking the polycationic domain demonstrate that this region is essential for PIP binding. Data gathered with IBDV mutants expressing C-terminal deleted VP5 polypeptides generated by reverse genetics demonstrate that the VP5-PIP binding domain is required both for its PM targeting in infected cells, and for efficient virus dissemination. Data presented here lead us to hypothesize that IBDV might use a non-lytic VP5-dependent cell-to-cell spreading mechanism.","Méndez, Fernando; de Garay, Tomás; Rodríguez, Dolores; Rodríguez, José F.",PLoS One,97,28

Here, we show that both Apol9 isoforms (Apol9b and Apol9a) inhibit replication of Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) but not replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Murid herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4), or infection by a lentiviral vector. Apol9 genes are strongly expressed in mouse liver and, to a lesser extent, in pancreas, adipose tissue and intestine. Their expression is increased by type I interferon and viral infection. In contrast to genuine apolipoproteins that are involved in lipid transport, ApoL9 has an intracytoplasmic localization and does not seem to be secreted. The cytoplasmic localization of ApoL9 is in line with the observation that ApoL9 inhibits the replication step of TMEV infection. In contrast to human ApoL6, ApoL9 did not sensitize cells to apoptosis, in spite of the presence of a conserved putative BH3 domain, required for antiviral activity. ApoL9a and b isoforms interact with cellular prohibitin 1 (Phb1) and prohibitin 2 (Phb2) and this interaction might contribute to ApoL9 antiviral activity. Knocking down Phb2 slightly increased TMEV replication, irrespective of ApoL9 overexpression. The antiviral activity of prohibitins against TMEV contrasts with the pro-viral activity of prohibitins observed for VSV and reported previously for Dengue 2 (DENV-2), Chikungunya (CHIKV) and influenza H5N1 viruses. ApoL9 is thus an example of ISG displaying a narrow antiviral range, which likely acts in complex with prohibitins to restrict TMEV replication.","Kreit, Marguerite; Vertommen, Didier; Gillet, Laurent; Michiels, Thomas",PLoS One,97,28
1949,1949,1949,ADAP2 Is an Interferon Stimulated Gene That Restricts RNA Virus Entry,10.133791,7.373482,2015-09-15,"Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) target viruses at various stages of their infectious life cycles, including at the earliest stage of viral entry. Here we identify ArfGAP with dual pleckstrin homology (PH) domains 2 (ADAP2) as a gene upregulated by type I IFN treatment in a STAT1-dependent manner. ADAP2 functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Arf6 and binds to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P(3)) and PI(3,4)P(2). We show that overexpression of ADAP2 suppresses dengue virus (DENV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection in an Arf6 GAP activity-dependent manner, while exerting no effect on coxsackievirus B (CVB) or Sendai virus (SeV) replication. We further show that ADAP2 expression induces macropinocytosis and that ADAP2 strongly associates with actin-enriched membrane ruffles and with Rab8a- and LAMP1-, but not EEA1- or Rab7-, positive vesicles. Utilizing two techniques—light-sensitive neutral red (NR)-containing DENV and fluorescence assays for virus internalization—we show that ADAP2 primarily restricts DENV infection at the stage of virion entry and/or intracellular trafficking and that incoming DENV and VSV particles associate with ADAP2 during their entry. Taken together, this study identifies ADAP2 as an ISG that exerts antiviral effects against RNA viruses by altering Arf6-mediated trafficking to disrupt viral entry.","Shu, Qian; Lennemann, Nicholas J.; Sarkar, Saumendra N.; Sadovsky, Yoel; Coyne, Carolyn B.",PLoS Pathog,97,28

During infection with RNA viruses, 5′-di- or -triphosphates accompanying specific single or double-stranded RNA motifs trigger signaling of intracellular RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and initiate the antiviral response. Although these molecular signatures are present during the replication of many viruses, it is unknown whether they are sufficient for strong activation of RLRs during infection. Immunostimulatory defective viral genomes (iDVGs) from Sendai virus (SeV) are among the most potent natural viral triggers of antiviral immunity. Here we describe an RNA motif (DVG(70-114)) that is essential for the potent immunostimulatory activity of 5′-triphosphate-containing SeV iDVGs. DVG(70-114) enhances viral sensing by the host cell independently of the long stretches of complementary RNA flanking the iDVGs, and it retains its stimulatory potential when transferred to otherwise inert viral RNA. In vitro analysis showed that DVG(70-114) augments the binding of RIG-I to viral RNA and promotes enhanced RIG-I polymerization, thereby facilitating the onset of the antiviral response. Together, our results define a new natural viral PAMP enhancer motif that promotes viral recognition by RLRs and confers potent immunostimulatory activity to viral RNA.","Xu, Jie; Mercado-López, Xiomara; Grier, Jennifer T.; Kim, Won-keun; Chun, Lauren F.; Irvine, Edward B.; Del Toro Duany, Yoandris; Kell, Alison; Hur, Sun; Gale, Michael; Raj, Arjun; López, Carolina B.",mBio,97,1

The modulation of host-virus interactions is a promising strategy to combat the virus; however, the interactions between the host and avian ILT herpesvirus (ILTV) are unclear. Using genome-wide transcriptome studies in combination with a bioinformatic analysis, we identified proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (Src) to be an important modulator of ILTV infection. Src controls the virulence of ILTV and is phosphorylated upon ILTV infection. Functional studies revealed that Src prolongs the survival of host cells by increasing the threshold of virus-induced cell death. Therefore, Src is essential for viral replication in vitro and in ovo but is not required for ILTV-induced cell death. Furthermore, our results identify a positive-feedback loop between Src and the tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is necessary for the phosphorylation of either Src or FAK and is required for Src to modulate ILTV infection. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to identify a key host regulator controlling host-ILTV interactions. We believe that our findings have revealed a new potential therapeutic target for ILT control and therapy. IMPORTANCE Despite the extensive administration of live attenuated vaccines starting from the mid-20th century and the administration of recombinant vaccines in recent years, infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) outbreaks due to avian ILT herpesvirus (ILTV) occur worldwide annually. Presently, there are no drugs or control strategies that effectively treat ILT. Targeting of host-virus interactions is considered to be a promising strategy for controlling ILTV infections. However, little is known about the mechanisms governing host-ILTV interactions. The results from our study advance our understanding of host-ILTV interactions on a molecular level and provide experimental evidence that it is possible to control ILT via the manipulation of host-virus interactions.","Li, Hai; Wang, Fengjie; Han, Zongxi; Gao, Qi; Li, Huixin; Shao, Yuhao; Sun, Nana; Liu, Shengwang",J Virol,97,28

Although the infection in natural hosts and zoonotic transmission to humans is asymptomatic, FVs can replicate well in human cells making it an attractive gene therapy vector candidate. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy and (cryo-)electron tomography ultrastructural data on purified prototype FV (PFV) and PFV infected cells. Mature PFV particles have a distinct morphology with a capsid of constant dimension as well as a less ordered shell of density between the capsid and the membrane likely formed by the Gag N-terminal domain and the cytoplasmic part of the Env leader peptide gp18(LP). The viral membrane contains trimeric Env glycoproteins partly arranged in interlocked hexagonal assemblies. In situ 3D reconstruction by subtomogram averaging of wild type Env and of a Env gp48(TM)- gp80(SU) cleavage site mutant showed a similar spike architecture as well as stabilization of the hexagonal lattice by clear connections between lower densities of neighboring trimers. Cryo-EM was employed to obtain a 9 Å resolution map of the glycoprotein in its pre-fusion state, which revealed extensive trimer interactions by the receptor binding subunit gp80(SU) at the top of the spike and three central helices derived from the fusion protein subunit gp48(TM). The lower part of Env, presumably composed of interlaced parts of gp48(TM), gp80(SU) and gp18(LP) anchors the spike at the membrane. We propose that the gp48(TM) density continues into three central transmembrane helices, which interact with three outer transmembrane helices derived from gp18(LP). Our ultrastructural data and 9 Å resolution glycoprotein structure provide important new insights into the molecular architecture of PFV and its distinct evolutionary relationship with other members of the Retroviridae.","Effantin, Grégory; Estrozi, Leandro F.; Aschman, Nick; Renesto, Patricia; Stanke, Nicole; Lindemann, Dirk; Schoehn, Guy; Weissenhorn, Winfried",PLoS Pathog,97,28

A protein-binding nucleophile reacts reversibly with a bis-electrophilic warhead, thereby positioning the second electrophile in close proximity of the active site of a viral protease, resulting in the covalent de-activation of the enzyme. The concept is implemented for Coxsackie virus B3 3C protease, a pharmacological target against enteroviral infections. Using an aldehyde-epoxide as bis-electrophile, active fragment combinations are validated through measuring the protein inactivation rate and by detecting covalent protein modification in mass spectrometry.

Lumpy skin disease (LSD) leads to significant economic losses due to hide damage, reduction of milk production, mastitis, infertility and mortalities (10 %). Early detection of the virus is crucial to start appropriate outbreak control measures. Veterinarians rely on the presence of the characteristic clinical signs of LSD. Laboratory diagnostics including virus isolation, sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are performed at well-equipped laboratories. In this study, a portable, simple, and rapid recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay for the detection of LSDV-genome for the use on farms was developed. RESULTS: The LSDV RPA assay was performed at 42 °C and detected down to 179 DNA copies/reaction in a maximum of 15 min. Unspecific amplification was observed with neither LSDV-negative samples (n = 12) nor nucleic acid preparations from orf virus, bovine papular stomatitis virus, cowpoxvirus, Peste des petits ruminants and Blue tongue virus (serotypes 1, 6 and 8). The clinical sensitivity of the LSDV RPA assay matched 100 % (n = 22) to real-time PCR results. In addition, the LSDV RPA assay detected sheep and goat poxviruses.

Here, we show that FLJ11286, which we refer to as IRAV, is induced by DENV in an interferon-dependent manner, displays antiviral activity against DENV, and localizes to the DENV replication complex. IRAV is an RNA binding protein and localizes to cytoplasmic processing bodies (P bodies) in uninfected cells, where it interacts with the MOV10 RISC complex RNA helicase, suggesting a role for IRAV in the processing of viral RNA. After DENV infection, IRAV, along with MOV10 and Xrn1, localizes to the DENV replication complex and associates with DENV proteins. Depletion of IRAV or MOV10 results in an increase in viral RNA. These data serve to characterize an interferon-stimulated gene with antiviral activity against DENV, as well as to propose a mechanism of activity involving the processing of viral RNA. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus, a member of the family Flaviviridae, can result in a life-threatening illness and has a significant impact on global health. Dengue virus has been shown to be particularly sensitive to the effects of type I interferon; however, little is known about the mechanisms by which interferon-stimulated genes function to inhibit viral replication. A better understanding of the interferon-mediated antiviral response to dengue virus may aid in the development of novel therapeutics. Here, we examine the influence of the interferon-stimulated gene IRAV (FLJ11286) on dengue virus replication. We show that IRAV associates with P bodies in uninfected cells and with the dengue virus replication complex after infection. IRAV also interacts with MOV10, depletion of which is associated with increased viral replication.

This study examined the transcriptome of tracheal epithelial cells from two inbred chicken lines that differ in NDV susceptibility after challenge with a high-titer inoculum of lentogenic NDV. The Fayoumi line had a significantly lower NDV load postchallenge than the Leghorn line, demonstrating the Fayoumi line's classification as a relatively NDV-resistant breed. Examination of the trachea transcriptome showed a large increase in immune cell infiltration in the trachea in both lines at all times postinfection. The pathways conserved across lines and at all three time points postinfection included iCOS-iCOSL signaling in T helper cells, NF-κB signaling, the role of nuclear factor of activated T cells in the regulation of the immune response, calcium-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis, phospholipase C signaling, and CD28 signaling in T helper cells. Although shared pathways were seen in the Fayoumi and Leghorn lines, each line showed unique responses as well. The downregulation of collagen and the activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 signaling in the Fayoumis relative to the Leghorns at 2 days postinfection may contribute to the resistance phenotype seen in the Fayoumis. This study provides a further understanding of host-pathogen interactions which could improve vaccine efficacy and, in combination with genome-wide association studies, has the potential to advance strategies for breeding chickens with enhanced resistance to NDV.","Deist, Melissa S.; Gallardo, Rodrigo A.; Bunn, David A.; Kelly, Terra R.; Dekkers, Jack C.

While the formation of alphaviral nucleocapsid cores, consisting of cargo nucleic acid and the viral capsid protein, is an essential molecular process of infection, the precise interactions between the two partners are ill-defined. A CLIP-seq approach was used to screen for candidate sites of interaction between the viral Capsid protein and genomic RNA of Sindbis virus (SINV), a model alphavirus. The data presented in this report indicates that the SINV capsid protein binds to specific viral RNA sequences in the cytoplasm of infected cells, but its interaction with genomic RNA in mature extracellular viral particles is largely non-specific in terms of nucleotide sequence. Mutational analyses of the cytoplasmic viral RNA-capsid interaction sites revealed a functional role for capsid binding early in infection. Interaction site mutants exhibited decreased viral growth kinetics; however, this defect was not a function of decreased particle production. Rather mutation of the cytoplasmic capsid-RNA interaction sites negatively affected the functional capacity of the incoming viral genomic RNAs leading to decreased infectivity. Furthermore, cytoplasmic capsid interaction site mutants are attenuated in a murine model of neurotropic alphavirus infection. Collectively, the findings of this study indicate that the identified cytoplasmic interactions of the viral capsid protein and genomic RNA, while not essential for particle formation, are necessary for genomic RNA function early during infection. This previously unappreciated role of capsid protein during the alphaviral replication cycle also constitutes a novel virulence determinant.","Sokoloski, Kevin J.; Nease, Lauren M.; May, Nicholas A.; Gebhart, Natasha N.; Jones, Claire E.; Morrison, Thomas E.; Hardy, Richard W.",PLoS Pathog,97,28

This study aimed to see how mosquito cells can survive the infection during prosperous replication of the virus. In C6/36 cells, global protein translation was shut down after infection by DENV type 2 (DENV2). However, it returned to a normal level when infected cells were treated with an inhibitor of the protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) signaling pathway. Based on a 7-Methylguanosine 5′-triphosphate (m7GTP) pull-down assay, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex was also identified in DENV2-infected cells. This suggests that most mosquito proteins are synthesized via canonical cap-dependent translation. When the PERK signal pathway was inhibited, both accumulation of reactive oxygen species and changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential increased. This suggested that ER stress response was alleviated through the PERK-mediated shutdown of global proteins in DENV2-infected C6/36 cells. In the meantime, the activities of caspases-9 and -3 and the apoptosis-related cell death rate increased in C6/36 cells with PERK inhibition. This reflected that the PERK-signaling pathway is involved in determining cell survival, presumably by reducing DENV2-induced ER stress. Looking at the PERK downstream target, α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), an increased phosphorylation status was only shown in infected C6/36 cells. This indicated that recruitment of ribosome binding to the mRNA 5′-cap structure could have been impaired in cap-dependent translation. It turned out that shutdown of cellular protein translation resulted in a pro-survival effect on mosquito cells in response to DENV2 infection. As synthesis of viral proteins was not affected by the PERK signal pathway, an alternate mode other than cap-dependent translation may be utilized. This finding provides insights into elucidating how the PERK signal pathway modulates dynamic translation of proteins and helps mosquito cells survive continuous replication of the DENV2. It was ecologically important for virus amplification in mosquitoes and transmission to humans.","Hou, Jiun-Nan; Chen, Tien-Huang; Chiang, Yi-Hsuan; Peng, Jing-Yun; Yang, Tsong-Han; Cheng, Chih-Chieh; Sofiyatun, Eny; Chiu, Cheng-Hsun; Chiang-Ni, Chuan; Chen, Wei-June",Viruses,97,28

E1, E2 and the heterodimer complex E1E2 are candidate vaccine antigens, but are technically challenging to study because of difficulties in producing natively folded proteins by standard protein expression and purification methods. To better comprehend the antigenicity of these proteins, a library of alanine scanning mutants comprising the entirety of E1E2 (555 residues) was created for evaluating the role of each residue in the glycoproteins. The mutant library was probed, by a high-throughput flow cytometry-based assay, for binding with the co-receptor CD81, and a panel of 13 human and mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target continuous and discontinuous epitopes of E1, E2, and the E1E2 complex. Together with the recently determined crystal structure of E2 core domain (E2c), we found that several residues in the E2 back layer region indirectly impact binding of CD81 and mAbs that target the conserved neutralizing face of E2. These findings highlight an unexpected role for the E2 back layer in interacting with the E2 front layer for its biological function. We also identified regions of E1 and E2 that likely located at or near the interface of the E1E2 complex, and determined that the E2 back layer also plays an important role in E1E2 complex formation. The conformation-dependent reactivity of CD81 and the antibody panel to the E1E2 mutant library provides a global view of the influence of each amino acid (aa) on E1E2 expression and folding.

Here, we identify a possible signature of “dual-coding,” namely extensive adenine (A) enrichment at bacterial CDS fourth sites. In 99.07% of studied bacterial genomes, fourth site A use is greater than expected given genomic A-starting codon use. Arguing for nucleotide level selection, A-starting serine and arginine second codons are heavily utilized when compared with their non-A starting synonyms. Several models have the ability to explain some of this trend. In part, A-enrichment likely reduces 5′ mRNA stability, promoting translation initiation. However T/U, which may also reduce stability, is avoided. Further, +1 frameshifts on the initiating ATG encode a stop codon (TGA) provided A is the fourth residue, acting either as a frameshift “catch and destroy” or a frameshift stop and adjust mechanism and hence implicated in translation initiation. Consistent with both, genomes lacking TGA stop codons exhibit weaker fourth site A-enrichment. Sequences lacking a Shine–Dalgarno sequence and those without upstream leader genes, that may be more error prone during initiation, have greater utilization of A, again suggesting a role in initiation. The frameshift correction model is consistent with the notion that many genomic features are error-mitigation factors and provides the first evidence for site-specific out of frame stop codon selection. We conjecture that the NTG universal start codon may have evolved as a consequence of TGA being a stop codon and the ability of NTGA to rapidly terminate or adjust a ribosome.","Abrahams, Liam; Hurst, Laurence D",Mol Biol Evol,97,19

Darwinian fitness, defined as the advantage of a given genotype with respect to a reference one, is a complex property that captures, in a single figure, differences in performance at every stage of viral infection. To what extent does viral fitness result from specific molecular interactions with host factors and regulatory networks during infection? Can we identify host genes in functional classes whose expression depends on viral fitness? Here, we compared the transcriptomes of tobacco plants infected with seven genotypes of tobacco etch potyvirus that differ in fitness. We found that the larger the fitness differences among genotypes, the more dissimilar the transcriptomic profiles are. Consistently, two different mutations, one in the viral RNA polymerase and another in the viral suppressor of RNA silencing, resulted in significantly similar gene expression profiles. Moreover, we identified host genes whose expression showed a significant correlation, positive or negative, with the virus' fitness. Differentially expressed genes which were positively correlated with viral fitness activate hormone- and RNA silencing-mediated pathways of plant defense. In contrast, those that were negatively correlated with fitness affect metabolism, reducing growth, and development. Overall, these results reveal the high information content of viral fitness and suggest its potential use to predict differences in genomic profiles of infected hosts.","Cervera, Héctor; Ambrós, Silvia; Bernet, Guillermo P; Rodrigo, Guillermo; Elena, Santiago F",Mol Biol Evol,97,1

An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that both autophagy and apoptosis are important cellular mechanisms for maintaining homeostasis, and they participate in the host response to pathogens. However, the crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy in host cells during PPRV infection has not been clarified. In this study, autophagy was induced upon virus infection in caprine endometrial epithelial cells (EECs), as determined by the appearance of double- and single-membrane autophagy-like vesicles, LC3-I/LC3-II conversion, and p62 degradation. We also found that PPRV infection triggered a complete autophagic response, most likely mediated by the non-structural protein C and nucleoprotein N. Moreover, our results suggest that autophagy not only promotes the replication of PPRV in EECs but also provides a potential mechanism for inhibiting PPRV-induced apoptosis. Inhibiting autophagosome formation by wortmannin and knocking down the essential autophagic proteins Beclin-1 and ATG7 induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in EECs in PPRV infection. However, inhibiting autophagosome and lysosome fusion by NH(4)Cl and chloroquine did not increase the number of apoptotic cells. Collectively, these data are the first to indicate that PPRV-induced autophagy inhibits caspase-dependent apoptosis and thus contributes to the enhancement of viral replication and maturity in host cells.","Yang, Bo; Xue, Qinghong; Qi, Xuefeng; Wang, Xueping; Jia, Peilong; Chen, Shuying; Wang, Ting; Xue, Tianxia; Wang, Jingyu",Virulence,97,28

In this study, we evaluated the benefit of using the amiRNA vector against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). We designed three single amiRNA sequences against the consensus sequence of 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of JEV and tested their efficacy against cell culture-grown JEV Vellore strain (P20778) in neuronal cells. The binding ability of three amiRNAs on 3′UTR region was tested in vitro in HEK293T cells using a JEV 3′UTR tagged with luciferase reporter vector. Transient transfection of amiRNAs was nontoxic to cells as evident from the MTT assay and caused minimal induction in interferon-stimulated gene expression. Furthermore, our result suggested that transient expression of two amiRNAs (amiRNA #1 and amiRNA #2) significantly reduced intracellular viral RNA and nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein, as well as diminished infectious viral particle release up to 95% in the culture supernatant as evident from viral plaque reduction assay. Overall, our results indicated that RNA interference based on amiRNAs targeting viral conserved regions at 3′UTR was a useful approach for improvements of nucleic acid inhibitors against JEV.","Sharma, Himani; Tripathi, Aarti; Kumari, Bharti; Vrati, Sudhanshu; Banerjee, Arup",Nucleic Acid Ther,97,28
3528,3528,3528,RNA virus evasion of nonsense-mediated decay,10.076386,7.354101,2018-11-19,"Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a host RNA control pathway that removes aberrant transcripts with long 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) due to premature termination codons (PTCs) that arise through mutation or defective splicing. To maximize coding potential, RNA viruses often contain internally located stop codons that should also be prime targets for NMD. Using an agroinfiltration-based NMD assay in Nicotiana benthamiana, we identified two segments conferring NMD-resistance in the carmovirus Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) genome. The ribosome readthrough structure just downstream of the TCV p28 termination codon stabilized an NMD-sensitive reporter as did a frameshifting element from umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus. In addition, a 51-nt unstructured region (USR) at the beginning of the TCV 3’ UTR increased NMD-resistance 3-fold when inserted into an unrelated NMD-sensitive 3’ UTR. Several additional carmovirus 3’ UTRs also conferred varying levels of NMD resistance depending on the construct despite no sequence similarity in the analogous region. Instead, these regions displayed a marked lack of RNA structure immediately following the NMD-targeted stop codon. NMD-resistance was only slightly reduced by conversion of 19 pyrimidines in the USR to purines, but resistance was abolished when a 2-nt mutation was introduced downstream of the USR that substantially increased the secondary structure in the USR through formation of a stable hairpin. The same 2-nt mutation also enhanced the NMD susceptibility of a subgenomic RNA expressed independently of the genomic RNA. The conserved lack of RNA structure among most carmoviruses at the 5’ end of their 3’ UTR could serve to enhance subgenomic RNA stability, which would increase expression of the encoded capsid protein that also functions as the RNA silencing suppressor. These results demonstrate that the TCV genome has features that are inherently NMD-resistant and these strategies could be widespread among RNA viruses and NMD-resistant host mRNAs with long 3’ UTRs.","May, Jared P.; Yuan, Xuefeng; Sawicki, Erika; Simon, Anne E.",PLoS Pathog,97,28

Yet, remarkably, Atg8 also carries out lipidation-independent functions in non-autophagic processes. How Atg8 performs its moonlighting roles is unclear. Here we report that in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the lipidation-independent roles of Atg8 in maintaining normal morphology and functions of the vacuole require its interaction with a vacuole membrane protein Hfl1 (homolog of human TMEM184 proteins). Crystal structures revealed that the Atg8-Hfl1 interaction is not mediated by the typical Atg8-family-interacting motif (AIM) that forms an intermolecular β-sheet with Atg8. Instead, the Atg8-binding regions in Hfl1 proteins adopt a helical conformation, thus representing a new type of AIMs (termed helical AIMs here). These results deepen our understanding of both the functional versatility of Atg8 and the mechanistic diversity of Atg8 binding.","Liu, Xiao-Man; Yamasaki, Akinori; Du, Xiao-Min; Coffman, Valerie C; Ohsumi, Yoshinori; Nakatogawa, Hitoshi; Wu, Jian-Qiu; Noda, Nobuo N; Du, Li-Lin",,97,1

The arenavirus matrix protein Z has several functions during the virus life cycle, including coordinating viral assembly, driving the release of new virus particles, regulating viral polymerase activity, and antagonizing the host antiviral response. There is limited knowledge regarding how the various functions of Z are regulated. To investigate possible means of regulation, mass spectrometry was used to identify potential sites of phosphorylation in the LASV Z protein. This analysis revealed that two serines (S18, S98) and one tyrosine (Y97) are phosphorylated in the flexible N- and C-terminal regions of the protein. Notably, two of these sites, Y97 and S98, are located in (Y97) or directly adjacent to (S98) the PPXY late domain, an important motif for virus release. Studies with non-phosphorylatable and phosphomimetic Z proteins revealed that these sites are important regulators of the release of LASV particles and that host-driven, reversible phosphorylation may play an important role in the regulation of LASV Z protein function.","Ziegler, Christopher M.; Eisenhauer, Philip; Manuelyan, Inessa; Weir, Marion E.; Bruce, Emily A.; Ballif, Bryan A.; Botten, Jason",Pathogens,97,28
3645,3645,3645,ACBD3 Is an Essential Pan-enterovirus Host Factor That Mediates the Interaction between Viral 3A Protein and Cellular Protein PI4KB,10.142066,7.58598,2019-02-12,"The enterovirus genus of the picornavirus family includes a large number of important human pathogens such as poliovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus A71, and rhinoviruses. Like all other positive-strand RNA viruses, genome replication of enteroviruses occurs on rearranged membranous structures called replication organelles (ROs). Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ (PI4KB) is required by all enteroviruses for RO formation. The enteroviral 3A protein recruits PI4KB to ROs, but the exact mechanism remains elusive. Here, we investigated the role of acyl-coenzyme A binding domain containing 3 (ACBD3) in PI4KB recruitment upon enterovirus replication using ACBD3 knockout (ACBD3(KO)) cells. ACBD3 knockout impaired replication of representative viruses from four enterovirus species and two rhinovirus species. PI4KB recruitment was not observed in the absence of ACBD3. The lack of ACBD3 also affected the localization of individually expressed 3A, causing 3A to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum instead of the Golgi. Reconstitution of wild-type (wt) ACBD3 restored PI4KB recruitment and 3A localization, while an ACBD3 mutant that cannot bind to PI4KB restored 3A localization, but not virus replication. Consistently, reconstitution of a PI4KB mutant that cannot bind ACBD3 failed to restore virus replication in PI4KB(KO) cells. Finally, by reconstituting ACBD3 mutants lacking specific domains in ACBD3(KO) cells, we show that acyl-coenzyme A binding (ACB) and charged-amino-acid region (CAR) domains are dispensable for 3A-mediated PI4KB recruitment and efficient enterovirus replication. Altogether, our data provide new insight into the central role of ACBD3 in recruiting PI4KB by enterovirus 3A and reveal the minimal domains of ACBD3 involved in recruiting PI4KB and supporting enterovirus replication.","Lyoo, Heyrhyoung; van der Schaar, Hilde M.; Dorobantu, Cristina M.; Rabouw, Huib H.; Strating, Jeroen R.

Both virion types are infectious, but differ in the way they infect cells. Elucidating the entry mechanism for both virion types is essential to understand HEV biology and pathogenesis, and is relevant to the development of treatments and preventions for HEV.

4150,4150,4150,Comprehensive Interactome Analysis Reveals that STT3B Is Required for N-Glycosylation of Lassa Virus Glycoprotein,10.249609,7.645857,2019-11-13,"Lassa virus (LASV) is the causative agent of a fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans. The glycoprotein (GP) of LASV mediates viral entry into host cells, and correct processing and modification of GP by host factors is a prerequisite for virus replication. Here, using an affinity purification-coupled mass spectrometry (AP-MS) strategy, 591 host proteins were identified as interactors of LASV GP. Gene ontology analysis was performed to functionally annotate these proteins, and the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex was highly enriched. Functional studies conducted by using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockouts showed that STT3A and STT3B, the two catalytically active isoforms of the OST complex, are essential for the propagation of the recombinant arenavirus rLCMV/LASV glycoprotein precursor, mainly via affecting virus infectivity. Knockout of STT3B, but not STT3A, caused hypoglycosylation of LASV GP, indicating a preferential requirement of LASV for the STT3B-OST isoform. Furthermore, double knockout of magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1) and tumor suppressor candidate 3 (TUSC3), two specific subunits of STT3B-OST, also caused hypoglycosylation of LASV GP and affected virus propagation. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis revealed that the oxidoreductase CXXC active-site motif of MAGT1 or TUSC3 is essential for the glycosylation of LASV GP. NGI-1, a small-molecule OST inhibitor, can effectively reduce virus infectivity without affecting cell viability. The STT3B-dependent N-glycosylation of GP is conserved among other arenaviruses, including both the Old World and New World groups. Our study provided a systematic view of LASV GP-host interactions and revealed the preferential requirement of STT3B for LASV GP N-glycosylation. IMPORTANCE Glycoproteins play vital roles in the arenavirus life cycle by facilitating virus entry and participating in the virus budding process. N-glycosylation of GPs is responsible for their proper functioning; however, little is known about the host factors on which the virus depends for this process. In this study, a comprehensive LASV GP interactome was characterized, and further study revealed that STT3B-dependent N-glycosylation was preferentially required by arenavirus GPs and critical for virus infectivity. The two specific thioredoxin subunits of STT3B-OST MAGT1 and TUSC3 were found to be essential for the N-glycosylation of viral GP. NGI-1, a small-molecule inhibitor of OST, also showed a robust inhibitory effect on arenavirus. Our study provides new insights into LASV GP-host interactions and extends the potential targets for the development of novel therapeutics against Lassa fever in the future.","Zhu, Shenglin; Wan, Weiwei; Zhang, Yanjun; Shang, Weijuan; Pan, Xiaoyan; Zhang, Lei-Ke; Xiao, Gengfu",J Virol,97,28

Along with Ufd1, Npl4 forms a heterodimer (UN), and functions as a cofactor for the Cdc48 ATPase. Here, we report the crystal structures of yeast Npl4 in complex with Lys48-linked diubiquitin and with the Npl4-binding motif of Ufd1. The distal and proximal ubiquitin moieties of Lys48-linked diubiquitin primarily interact with the C-terminal helix and N-terminal loop of the Npl4 C-terminal domain (CTD), respectively. Mutational analysis suggests that the CTD contributes to linkage selectivity and initial binding of ubiquitin chains. Ufd1 occupies a hydrophobic groove of the Mpr1/Pad1 N-terminal (MPN) domain of Npl4, which corresponds to the catalytic groove of the MPN domain of JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme (JAMM)-family deubiquitylating enzyme.

Ub is highly conserved across eukaryotes, whereas ISG15 is only present in vertebrates and shows substantial sequence diversity. Prior attempts to address the effect of ISG15 diversity on viral protein-ISG15 interactions have focused on only a single species’ ISG15 or a limited selection of nairovirus OTUs. To gain a more complete perspective of OTU-ISG15 interactions, we biochemically assessed the relative activities of 14 diverse nairovirus OTUs for 12 species’ ISG15 and found that ISG15 activity is predominantly restricted to particular nairovirus lineages reflecting, in general, known virus-host associations. To uncover the underlying molecular factors driving OTUs affinity for ISG15, X-ray crystal structures of Kupe virus and Ganjam virus OTUs bound to sheep ISG15 were solved and compared to complexes of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and Erve virus OTUs bound to human and mouse ISG15, respectively. Through mutational and structural analysis seven residues in ISG15 were identified that predominantly influence ISG15 species specificity among nairovirus OTUs. Additionally, OTU residues were identified that influence ISG15 preference, suggesting the potential for viral OTUs to adapt to different host ISG15s. These findings provide a foundation to further develop research methods to trace nairovirus-host relationships and delineate the full impact of ISG15 diversity on nairovirus infection.","Dzimianski, John V.; Scholte, Florine E.

Those gene fragments were inserted into the pET30a expression vector. One recombinant strain with the highest expressed soluble eCap from four entire Cap (one wt-eCap and three opti-eCap) and one recombinant strain expressed opti-dCap were selected for further purification. The purified eCap and dCap were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), a large number of round hollow particles with a diameter of 10 nm virus-like particles (VLPs) were observed in eCap, whereas irregular aggregation of proteins observed in dCap. After formation the VLPs were applied as a coating antigen to establish an indirect ELISA (I-ELISA) for detection of PCV3-specific antibody in swine serum. 373 clinical swine serum samples from China collected in 2019 were tested utilizing the VLP-based I-ELISA method under optimized conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of self-assembly into VLPs of PCV3 recombinant Cap.

In the present study, progressively deleted lengths of the 5′ noncoding region of segment A were constructed in pGL3 vectors having SV40 enhancer or promoter, and a luciferase (LUC) reporter gene. Transient transfections of the constructs made in a promoter-less pGL3-Enhancer vector when transfected in Vero cells and the lysates assayed for LUC expression, allowed the localization of maximal activity to the 32-nucleotide stretch (precursor polyprotein ORF positions −131 to −100), which is highly conserved at the 5′ end of both genome segments. This fragment, when evaluated in parallel in an enhancer-less pGL3-Promoter vector demonstrated no activity. To determine if this region is recognized by IBDV replicative proteins, we engineered modifications in an enhancer-less pGL3-Promoter vector where the terminal 32-bp fragment, the full-length noncoding region, or the noncodig region with the 32-bp fragment deleted was positioned in either the plus-sense or the minus-sense orientation immediately downstream of the SV40 promoter and upstream of the LUC gene. Transfections of these constructs in IBDV-infected and uninfected Vero cells resulted in the endogenous generation of recombinant viral-LUC RNAs containing the 5′ terminal viral RNA sequences in either the plus-sense or the minus-sense orientation. LUC assays of the infected cell lysates showed up-regulated expression of LUC only with constructs containing the 32-bp fragment in the minus-sense orientation. Deletion of this 32-bp fragment abolished such LUC expression. We therefore conclude that the 5′-terminal 32 base pairs of genomic segment A contain a major promoter element in IBDV. In addition, our results show that IBDV replicative proteins recognize and transcribe single-stranded RNA in vivo.","Nagarajan, M. M.; Kibenge, F. S. B.",Arch Virol,97,1

Conventional and germ-free mice developed diarrhea from days 2 to 8 postinfection (pi), with growth failure. In mucosal homogenates, infectious virus detected by immunofluorescence on MA 104 cells was present from day 2 through day 8 pi in germ-free mice, but persisted longer (day 13 pi) in conventional mice. Only mild histological lesions were observed during diarrhea, but obvious macrovacuolation of epithelial cells and increased cellular density occurred during the convalescence period (days 9 to 13 pi). Intact and degraded HRP fluxes from mucosa to serosa were measured in vitro on segments of jejunum mounted in Ussing chambers. Both groups of mice developed increased HRP permeability during the experimental period, but at different times after inoculation: during the diarrheal period (days 2 and 3 pi) conventional mouse epithelium absorbed five times more HRP than noninfected controls and during the convalescence period (days 9 to 13 pi) HRP absorption in germ-free mice rose 10-fold as compared to its level before infection. In both cases, this increase in HRP permeability was entirely due to an increase in intact HRP absorption, probably via a transcellular route, and occurred without any alteration in degraded HRP transport. These results indicate that in mice, rotavirus infection causes a transient rise in gut permeability to undegraded proteins. The intestinal microflora seems to affect the timing, magnitude, and duration of this increased permeability.","Heyman, Martine; Corthier, Gerard; Petit, Agnes; Meslin, Jean-Claude; Moreau, Christiane; Desjeux, Jehan-François",Pediatr Res,97,28

Comparing the efficiency of different RNA templates, we found that JEV NS5 protein was more efficient in using negative-strand RNA templates, indicating that the JEV NS5 protein is involved in regulating the ratio of positive- to negative-strand RNA. Four amino acid sequence motifs crucial for RdRp activity were also identified using site-directed mutagenesis analysis. All substitutions of the conserved residues within these motifs led to a complete inactivation or severe loss of enzyme activity.","Yu, F.; Hasebe, F.; Inoue, S.; Mathenge, E. G.

An i. p. inoculum of 10(6) PFU of MCMV was fatal for more than two-thirds of infant mice (1–7 days of age), and disseminated viral infection was documented by isolation of virus from body organs. In contrast, weanling and adult rats did not become ill as a result of infection with a larger inoculum of 10(7) PFU. However, these older MCMV infected rats did show transient reversals of T helper/suppressor cell ratios and alterations of immune cell function as detected byin vitro spleen cell proliferation assays. Seven days after MCMV infection, there was a generalized increase in(3)H-thymidine incorporation by spleen cells in both resting (unstimulated) cultures and cultures exposed to mitogens (Con A, PHA, LPS) and to MCMV antigen. At 14 days, the spleen cell proliferation in the unstimulated cultures returned to normal but was depressed compared to controls in response to Con A. These observations show that laboratory rats are susceptible to MCMV infection and that assymptomatic infection may occur and cause transient alterations in lymphocyte subsets and in their reactivity to mitogens.","Smith, C.

With the help of peroxidase-labelled MAbs at least nine epitopes (epitope clusters) located on three distinct antigenic sites were identified on the hexon. Epitope on antigenic site I recognized by two MAbs could be the genus specific antigenic determinant based on the broad reactivity patterns of the MAbs. Epitopes on the antigenic site II recognized by fifteen MAbs could be divided into seven epitope clusters according to the competition patterns. Antigenic site III recognized by one MAb completely differs from the antigenic site I and on the basis of one-way blocking with all the MAbs specific for antigenic site II, should be also different from the latter one. The data suggest that the seven epitope clusters of antigenic site II contain partially overlapping epitopes and may be a part of a large single immunodominant antigenic region on AV1 hexon as well as on hexons of heterologous types.","Ádám, Éva; Nász, I.; Lengyel, Anna; Erdei, J.; Fachet, J.",Arch Virol,97,11

The aetiology of the disease has been reported to be multifactorial and both sporadic cases and nosocomial outbreaks have occurred. In this report, we review 17 epidemics of NEC reported in the literature between 1973 and 1999. The number of confirmed cases ranged from 1 to 32 with an average of 10.5 confirmed cases. On average, 16.15% of cases required surgery (range 0–66.6%). The average mortality rate was 6.25% (range 0–87.5%). The mean age at disease onset was 9.5 days (range 6.6–29 days). Most of the infants had low birth weight (median weight 1,395 g; range 1,112–2,788 g, calculated on the reported mean weights). The main risk factors associated with NEC were: low birth weight, low gestational age, low Apgar score, perinatal complications, hyaline membrane disease, and umbilical catheterisation. The bacteria involved often included Enterobacteriaceae, particularly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae type 3305573. The causative role of Clostridia in NEC is controversial. With regard to viral agents, coronarovirus, rotavirus and enterovirus, such as echovirus type 22, were isolated during some of the epidemics. The recommended control measures for NEC epidemics are those used for epidemics of other orofaecally transmitted infections. Conclusion Understanding the epidemiology of necrotising enterocolitis is fundamental if adequate preventive control measures are to be developed and applied.","Boccia, Delia; Stolfi, Ilaria; Lana, Susanna; Moro, Maria Luisa",Eur J Pediatr,97,11

Poly(A)(+) mRNA fractions from the 23-32 S area of a sucrose gradient were used to build a cDNA library in the expression vector λgt11 with an efficiency of cloning of approximately 10(4) recombinants/ng mRNA. Recombinant clones were screened with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the corn nitrate reductase, which cross reacts specifically with the nitrate reductases from dicotyledons. Among 240000 recombinant plaques, eight clones were isolated containing inserts of sizes ranging from 1.6 kb to 2.1 kb and sharing sequence homologies. Seven of these clones contained a common internal 1.6 kb EcoRI fragment. The identity of these clones was confirmed as follows. A fusion protein of 170 kDa inducible by IPTG and recognized by the rabbit nitrate reductase antibody was expressed by a lysogen derived from one of the recombinants. The antibodies binding the fused protein were eluted and shown to be inhibitory to the catalytic activity of tobacco nitrate reductase. Two monoclonal antibodies directed against nitrate reductase were also able to bind the hybrid protein. The 1.6 kb EcoRI fragment was sequenced by the method of Sanger. The open reading frame corresponding to a translational fusion with the β-galactosidase coding sequence of the vector shared strong homology at the amino acid level with the heme-binding domain of proteins of the cytochrome b5 superfamily and with human erythrocyte cytochrome b5 reductase.

An actual hospitalization room was the investigate case study. Transient simulations with computational fluid dynamics (CFD), based on the finite element method (FEM) were performed to investigate the efficiency of the existing heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) plant with a variable air volume (VAV) primary air system. Solid modelling of the room, taking into account thermo-physical properties of building materials, architectural features (e.g., window and wall orientation) and furnishing (e.g., beds, tables and lamps) arrangement of the room, inlet turbulence high induction air diffuser, the return air diffusers and two patients lying on two parallel beds was carried out. Multiphysics modelling was used: a thermo-fluidynamic model (convection-conduction and incompressible Navier-Stokes) was combined with a convection-diffusion model. Three 3D models were elaborated considering different conditions/events of the patients (i.e., the first was considered coughing and/or the second breathing). A particle tracing and diffusion model, connected to cough events, was developed to simulate the dispersal of bacteria-carrying droplets in the isolation room equipped with the existing ventilation system. An analysis of the region of droplet fallout and the dilution time of bacteria diffusion of coughed gas in the isolation room was performed. The analysis of transient simulation results concerning particle path and distance, and then particle tracing combined with their concentration, provided evidence of the formation of zones that should be checked by microclimatic and contaminant control. The present study highlights the fact that the CFD-FEM application is useful for understanding the efficiency, adequacy and reliability of the ventilation system, but also provides important suggestions for controlling air quality, patients’ comfort and energy consumption in a hospital.","Balocco, Carla",Build Simul,97,8

Pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators constitute the inflammatory cytokines, which are modulated by various stimuli, including physical activity, trauma and infection. Physical activity affects local and systemic cytokine production at different levels, often exhibiting striking similarity to the cytokine response to trauma and infection. The present review examines the cytokine response to short term exercise stress, with an emphasis on the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms and modulation of both innate and specific immune parameters through cytokine regulation. The effects of long term exercise on cytokine responses and the possible impact on various facets of the immune system are also discussed, with reference to both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of exercise training. Finally, the validity of using exercise as a model for trauma and sepsis is scrutinised in the light of physiological changes, symptomatology and outcome, and limitations of the model are addressed. Further studies, examining the effect of exercise, trauma and infection on novel cytokines and cytokine systems are needed to elucidate the significance of cytokine regulation by physical activity and, more importantly, to clarify the health implications of short and long term physical activity with respect to overall immune function and resistance to infection.","Moldoveanu, Andrei I.; Shephard, Roy J.; Shek, Pang N.",Sports Med,97,28

This H7N9 virus appeared to infect humans with greater ease than previous avian influenza virus subtypes such as H5N1 and H9N2. While there are other potential explanations for this large number of human infections with an avian influenza virus, we investigated whether a lack of conserved T-cell epitopes between endemic H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses and the novel H7N9 virus contributes to this observation. Here we demonstrate that a number of T cell epitopes are conserved between endemic H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and H7N9 virus. Most of these conserved epitopes are from viral internal proteins. The extent of conservation between endemic human seasonal influenza and avian influenza H7N9 was comparable to that with the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1. Thus, the ease of inter-species transmission of H7N9 viruses (compared with avian H5N1 viruses) cannot be attributed to the lack of conservation of such T cell epitopes. On the contrary, our findings predict significant T-cell based cross-reactions in the human population to the novel H7N9 virus. Our findings also have implications for H7N9 virus vaccine design.","Mao, Huawei; Yen, Hui-Ling; Liu, Yinping; Lau, Yu-Lung; Malik Peiris, J. S.; Tu, Wenwei",Virol Sin,97,28

The results clearly indicated that rotavirus infection is widespread and supported the evidence for an etiologic role of these viruses in neonatal diarrhea. The evidence of differences in virulence among bovine rotaviruses appeared also to be confirmed. Conventionally reared calves were fully susceptible to the experimental infection induced by three rotaviruses originating from heterologous hosts, i.e. monkeys, pigs and rabbits, respectively. When rotavirus strains of bovine, simian, porcine and rabbit origin were compared by cross neutralization tests, it was found the simian and porcine strains were indistinguishable and both appeared to relate antigenically to the bovine strain. On the other hand, a reciprocal antigenic correlation was found between bovine and rabbit isolates. Finally, it was proven that feeding newborn calves with colostrum of their dams, previously vaccinated with an inactivated rotavirus vaccine, could prevent the neonatal diarrhea from occurring.","Castrucci, G; Frigeri, F; Ferrari, M; Cilli, V; Gualandi, G.L; Aldrovandi, V",Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,97,28

In 1994 a comparative study of the behaviour of two ♀♀ with new‐born pups was carried out at Belo Horizonte Zoo to try to establish the ♂'s role in rearing: one ♀ was housed alone with her pups throughout the observation period; the other ♂ was housed with the ♀ and pups for the first month and alone with the pups for the second month of observation. The applied methodology for behaviour evaluation was instantaneous sampling (scan). The behaviour of each adult was recorded at one‐minute intervals. Location in the enclosure and spatial proximity were also recorded. The results suggest that Maned wolves are inactive for large parts of the day and that they prefer secluded areas within an enclosure. The results also suggest that only the ♂ is directly involved in rearing the offspring and that ♀ participation is limited to protection only. The time that the ♂ stays with the pups is at a maximum on the days immediately following birth, but this time decreases considerably as the pups grow. At around day 50, when lactation has ceased, contact between the ♂ and pups is minimal and the pups have their own resting places within the enclosure. These resting places, inside the burrows or thick vegetation, are rarely shared with others.","VEADO, BERNADETTE VENTURA",Int Zoo Yearb,97,28

Most residents are older and have multiple comorbidities that complicate recognition of infection; for example, typically defined fever is absent in more than one‐half of LTCF residents with serious infection. Furthermore, LTCFs often do not have the on‐site equipment or personnel to evaluate suspected infection in the fashion typically performed in acute care hospitals. In recognition of the differences between LTCFs and hospitals with regard to hosts and resources present, the Infectious Diseases Society of America first provided guidelines for evaluation of fever and infection in LTCF residents in 2000. The guideline presented here represents the second edition, updated by data generated over the intervening 8 years. It focuses on the typical elderly person institutionalized with multiple chronic comorbidities and functional disabilities (e.g., a nursing home resident). Specific topic reviews and recommendations are provided with regard to what resources are typically available to evaluate suspected infection, what symptoms and signs suggest infection in a resident of an LTCF, who should initially evaluate the resident with suspected infection, what clinical evaluation should be performed, how LTCF staff can effectively communicate about possible infection with clinicians, and what laboratory tests should be ordered. Finally, a general outline of how a suspected outbreak of a specific infectious disease should be investigated in an LTCF is provided.","High, Kevin P.; Bradley, Suzanne F.; Gravenstein, Stefan; Mehr, David R.; Quagliarello, Vincent J.; Richards, Chesley; Yoshikawa, Thomas T.",J Am Geriatr Soc,97,28

During cumulative periods designated ""at risk"" (2 weeks before the onset of infection until 5 weeks afterwards) annual exacerbation rates were almost 3-fold greater than those during periods not at risk. Approximately 9% of infections were temporally related to exacerbations, whereas 27% of exacerbations were related to infections. Frequency of common infections was approximately 20-50% less in MS patients than controls; it was progressively less in those with greater disability. Even in minimally disabled patients with similar potential for infectious contacts, the infection rate was significantly less than in controls, suggesting that MS patients could have superior immune defences against common viruses.","Sibley, WilliamA.; Bamford, ColinR.; Clark, Katherine",Lancet,97,28

The field has advanced dramatically over the past 40 years, driven in part by major advances in isolation and manufacturing technologies that have brought these important biologics to the forefront of modern medicine. However, the global uptake of monoclonal antibody (mAb) biologics is impeded by biophysical and biochemical liabilities, production limitations, the need for cold-chain storage and transport, as well as high costs of manufacturing and distribution. Some of these hurdles may be overcome through transient in vivo gene delivery platforms, such as non-viral synthetic plasmid DNA and messenger RNA vectors that are engineered to encode optimized mAb genes. These approaches turn the body into a biological factory for antibody production, eliminating many of the steps involved in bioprocesses and providing several other significant advantages, and differ from traditional gene therapy (permanent delivery) approaches. In this review, we focus on nucleic acid delivery of antibody employing synthetic plasmid DNA vector platforms, and RNA delivery, these being important approaches that are advancing simple, rapid, in vivo expression and having an impact in animal models of infectious diseases and cancer, among others.","Patel, Ami; Bah, Mamadou A.; Weiner, David B.",BioDrugs,97,1

This study sought to develop and evaluate a unified population pharmacokinetic model in both pediatric and adult patients receiving cefepime treatment. METHODS: Multiple physiologically relevant models were fit to pediatric and adult subject data. To evaluate the final model performance, a withheld group of 12 pediatric patients and two separate adult populations were assessed. RESULTS: Seventy subjects with a total of 604 cefepime concentrations were included in this study. All adults (n = 34) on average weighed 82.7 kg and displayed a mean creatinine clearance of 106.7 mL/min. All pediatric subjects (n = 36) had mean weight and creatinine clearance of 16.0 kg and 195.6 mL/min, respectively. A covariate-adjusted two-compartment model described the observed concentrations well (population model R(2), 87.0%; Bayesian model R(2), 96.5%). In the evaluation subsets, the model performed similarly well (population R(2), 84.0%; Bayesian R(2), 90.2%).

We compared the prognostic value of ∆PCO(2) on intensive care unit (ICU) admission to an original algorithm combining ∆PCO(2), ERO(2) and lactate to identify different risk profiles. Additionally, we described the evolution of ∆PCO(2) and its correlations with ERO(2) and lactate during the first postoperative day (POD1). In this monocentre, prospective, and pilot study, 25 patients undergoing conventional cardiac surgery were included. Central venous and arterial blood gases were collected on ICU admission and at 6, 12 and 24 h postoperatively. High ∆PCO(2) (≥ 6 mmHg) on ICU admission was found to be very frequent (64% of patients). Correlations between ∆PCO(2) and ERO(2) or lactate for POD1 values and variations were weak or non-existent. On ICU admission, a high ∆PCO(2) did not predict a prolonged ICU length of stay (LOS). Conversely, a significant increase in both ICU and hospital LOS was observed in high-risk patients identified by the algorithm: 3.5 (3.0–6.3) days versus 7.0 (6.0–8.0) days (p = 0.01) and 12.0 (8.0–15.0) versus 8.0 (8.0–9.0) days (p < 0.01), respectively. An algorithm incorporating ICU admission values of ∆PCO(2), ERO(2) and lactate defined a high-risk profile that predicted prolonged ICU and hospital stays better than ∆PCO(2) alone.","Portran, Philippe; Jacquet-Lagreze, Matthias; Schweizer, Remi; Fornier, William; Chardonnal, Laurent; Pozzi, Matteo; Fischer, Marc-Olivier; Fellahi, Jean-Luc",J Clin Monit Comput,97,28

STUDY DESIGN: Population-based database was used to evaluate 47,794 infants transported before 7 days after birth from 2007 to 2016. Log binomial regression was used to estimate relative risks. RESULTS: 30.8% of infants had clinical deterioration. Clinical deterioration was associated with prematurity, delivery room resuscitation, severe birth defects, emergent transports, transports by helicopter and requests for delivery room attendance. When evaluating transport time intervals, time required for evaluation by the transport team was associated with increased risk of clinical deterioration. Modifiable transport intervals were not associated with increased risk. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that high-risk infants are more likely to be unstable during transport. Coordination and timing of neonatal transport in California appears to be effective and does not seem to contribute to clinical deterioration despite variation in the duration of these processes.","Pai, Vidya V.; Kan, Peiyi; Gould, Jeffrey B.; Hackel, Alvin; Lee, Henry C.",J Perinatol,97,28

Indirect transmission facilitates spread from multiple sources beyond the infectious host, complicating the epidemiology and control of these diseases. This study carried out a series of transmission experiments to determine the dose-response relationship between environmental contamination and transmission of FMDV in cattle from measurements of viral shedding and rates of environmental contamination and survival. Seven out of ten indirect exposures resulted in successful transmission. The basic reproduction number for environmental transmission of FMDV in this experimental setting was estimated at 1.65, indicating that environmental transmission alone could sustain an outbreak. Importantly, detection of virus in the environment prior to the appearance of clinical signs in infected cattle and successful transmission from these environments highlights there is a risk of environmental transmission even before foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is clinically apparent in cattle. Estimated viral decay rates suggest that FMDV remained viable in this environment for up to 14 days, emphasizing the requirement for stringent biosecurity procedures following outbreaks of FMD and the design of control measures that reflect the biology of a pathogen.","Colenutt, Claire; Brown, Emma; Nelson, Noel; Paton, David J.; Eblé, Phaedra; Dekker, Aldo; Gonzales, José L.; Gubbins, Simon",mBio,97,28

Among the many developmental phenomena that generate change programmed cell death (PCD) appears to play a key role. We show that cell death occurs continuously throughout insect neurogenesis and happens soon after neurons are born. Mimicking an evolutionary role for increasing cell numbers, we artificially block PCD in the medial neuroblast lineage in Drosophila melanogaster, which results in the production of ‘undead’ neurons with complex arborisations and distinct neurotransmitter identities. Activation of these ‘undead’ neurons and recordings of neural activity in behaving animals demonstrate that they are functional. Focusing on two dipterans which have lost flight during evolution we reveal that reductions in populations of flight interneurons are likely caused by increased cell death during development. Our findings suggest that the evolutionary modulation of death-based patterning could generate novel network configurations.","Pop, Sinziana; Chen, Chin-Lin; Sproston, Connor J; Kondo, Shu; Ramdya, Pavan; Williams, Darren W",,97,1

Viral double-stranded (ds) RNA activates OAS isoforms that synthesize the second messenger 2-5A, which binds and activates the pseudokinase-endoribonuclease RNase L. In cells, OAS activation is tamped down by ADAR1, an adenosine deaminase that destabilizes dsRNA. Mutation of ADAR1 is one cause of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), an interferonopathy in children. ADAR1 deficiency in human cells can lead to RNase L activation and subsequent cell death. To evaluate RNase L as a possible therapeutic target for AGS, we sought to identify small-molecule inhibitors of RNase L. A 500-compound library of protein kinase inhibitors was screened for modulators of RNase L activity in vitro. We identified ellagic acid (EA) as a hit with 10-fold higher selectivity against RNase L compared with its nearest paralog, IRE1. SAR analysis identified valoneic acid dilactone (VAL) as a superior inhibitor of RNase L, with 100-fold selectivity over IRE1. Mechanism-of-action analysis indicated that EA and VAL do not bind to the pseudokinase domain of RNase L despite acting as ATP competitive inhibitors of the protein kinase CK2. VAL is nontoxic and functional in cells, although with a 1,000-fold decrease in potency, as measured by RNA cleavage activity in response to treatment with dsRNA activator or by rescue of cell lethality resulting from self dsRNA induced by ADAR1 deficiency. These studies lay the foundation for understanding novel modes of regulating RNase L function using small-molecule inhibitors and avenues of therapeutic potential.","Daou, Salima; Talukdar, Manisha; Tang, Jinle; Dong, Beihua; Banerjee, Shuvojit; Li, Yize; Duffy, Nicole M.; Ogunjimi, Abiodun A.; Gaughan, Christina; Jha, Babal K.; Gish, Gerald; Tavernier, Nicolas; Mao, Daniel; Weiss, Susan R.; Huang, Hao; Silverman, Robert H.; Sicheri, Frank",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,97,1

This phenomenon, highlighted by the different distribution of opening/closing pressure and by the hysteresis of the pressure–volume curve, can be studied by CT scan, but the technique expose the patient to radiations, cannot track changes during time and is not feasible at the bedside. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) could help in assessing at the bedside regional inspiratory and expiratory mechanical properties. We evaluated regional opening/closing pressures, hysteresis and atelectrauma during inspiratory and expiratory low-flow pressure–volume curves in ARDS using electrical impedance tomography. METHODS: Pixel-level inspiratory and expiratory PV curves (PV(pixel)) between 5 and 40 cmH(2)O were constructed integrating EIT images and airway opening pressure signal from 8 ARDS patients. The lower inflection point in the inspiratory and expiratory PV(pixel) were used to find opening (OP(pixel)) and closing (CP(pixel)) pressures. A novel atelectrauma index (AtI) was calculated as the percentage of pixels opening during the inspiratory and closing during the expiratory PV curves. The maximal hysteresis (HysMax) was calculated as the maximal difference between normalized expiratory and inspiratory PV curves. Analyses were conducted in the global, dependent and non-dependent lung regions. RESULTS: Gaussian distribution was confirmed for both global OP(pixel) (r(2) = 0.90) and global CP(pixel) (r(2) = 0.94). The two distributions were significantly different with higher values for OP(pixel) (p < 0.0001). Regional OP(pixel) and CP(pixel) distributions were Gaussian, and in the dependent lung regions, both were significantly higher than in the non-dependent ones (p < 0.001). Both AtI and the HysMax were significantly higher in the dependent regions compared to the non-dependent ones (p < 0.05 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Gravity impacts the regional distribution of opening and closing pressure, hysteresis and atelectrauma, with higher values in the dorsal lung. Regional differences between inspiratory and expiratory lung physiology are detectable at the bedside using EIT and could allow in-depth characterization of ARDS phenotypes and guide personalized ventilation settings.

Understanding the contribution of treatment delay on progression to severe disease is critical to determine how quickly patients need to receive treatment and to quantify the impact of widely implemented treatment interventions, such as ‘test-and-treat’ policies administered by community health workers (CHWs). We conducted a pooled individual-participant meta-analysis to estimate the association between treatment delay and presenting with SM. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A search using Ovid MEDLINE and Embase was initially conducted to identify studies on severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria that included information on treatment delay, such as fever duration (inception to 22nd September 2017). Studies identified included 5 case–control and 8 other observational clinical studies of SM and UM cases. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale, and all studies were ranked as ‘Good’, scoring ≥7/10. Individual-patient data (IPD) were pooled from 13 studies of 3,989 (94.1% aged <15 years) SM patients and 5,780 (79.6% aged <15 years) UM cases in Benin, Malaysia, Mozambique, Tanzania, The Gambia, Uganda, Yemen, and Zambia. Definitions of SM were standardised across studies to compare treatment delay in patients with UM and different SM phenotypes using age-adjusted mixed-effects regression. The odds of any SM phenotype were significantly higher in children with longer delays between initial symptoms and arrival at the health facility (odds ratio [OR] = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.07–1.64 for a delay of >24 hours versus ≤24 hours; p = 0.009). Reported illness duration was a strong predictor of presenting with severe malarial anaemia (SMA) in children, with an OR of 2.79 (95% CI:1.92–4.06; p < 0.001) for a delay of 2–3 days and 5.46 (95% CI: 3.49–8.53; p < 0.001) for a delay of >7 days, compared with receiving treatment within 24 hours from symptom onset. We estimate that 42.8% of childhood SMA cases and 48.5% of adult SMA cases in the study areas would have been averted if all individuals were able to access treatment within the first day of symptom onset, if the association is fully causal. In studies specifically recording onset of nonsevere symptoms, long treatment delay was moderately associated with other SM phenotypes (OR [95% CI] >3 to ≤4 days versus ≤24 hours: cerebral malaria [CM] = 2.42 [1.24–4.72], p = 0.01; respiratory distress syndrome [RDS] = 4.09 [1.70–9.82], p = 0.002). In addition to unmeasured confounding, which is commonly present in observational studies, a key limitation is that many severe cases and deaths occur outside healthcare facilities in endemic countries, where the effect of delayed or no treatment is difficult to quantify. CONCLUSIONS: Our results quantify the relationship between rapid access to treatment and reduced risk of severe disease, which was particularly strong for SMA. There was some evidence to suggest that progression to other severe phenotypes may also be prevented by prompt treatment, though the association was not as strong, which may be explained by potential selection bias, sample size issues, or a difference in underlying pathology. These findings may help assess the impact of interventions that improve access to treatment.","Mousa, Andria; Al-Taiar, Abdullah; Anstey, Nicholas M.; Badaut, Cyril; Barber, Bridget E.; Bassat, Quique; Challenger, Joseph D.; Cunnington, Aubrey J.; Datta, Dibyadyuti; Drakeley, Chris; Ghani, Azra C.; Gordeuk, Victor R.; Grigg, Matthew J.; Hugo, Pierre; John, Chandy C.; Mayor, Alfredo; Migot-Nabias, Florence; Opoka, Robert O.; Pasvol, Geoffrey; Rees, Claire; Reyburn, Hugh; Riley, Eleanor M.; Shah, Binal N.; Sitoe, Antonio; Sutherland, Colin J.; Thuma, Philip E.; Unger, Stefan A.; Viwami, Firmine; Walther, Michael; Whitty, Christopher J.

While the evolutionary mechanisms behind tRNA gene set evolution have been investigated theoretically and computationally, direct observations of tRNA gene set evolution remain rare. Here, we report the evolution of a tRNA gene set in laboratory populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25. The growth defect caused by deleting the single-copy tRNA gene, serCGA, is rapidly compensated by large-scale (45–290 kb) duplications in the chromosome. Each duplication encompasses a second, compensatory tRNA gene (serTGA) and is associated with a rise in tRNA-Ser(UGA) in the mature tRNA pool. We postulate that tRNA-Ser(CGA) elimination increases the translational demand for tRNA-Ser(UGA), a pressure relieved by increasing serTGA copy number. This work demonstrates that tRNA gene sets can evolve through duplication of existing tRNA genes, a phenomenon that may contribute to the presence of multiple, identical tRNA gene copies within genomes.","Ayan, Gökçe B; Park, Hye Jin; Gallie, Jenna",,97,28

However, research has not yet examined the changing roles of hospital administrative staff. This study clarified: (1) the adverse incidents caused by hospital administrative staff, and the direct and indirect impact of these incidents on patient care; and (2) the incidents that directly involved hospital administrative staff. METHODS: This study used case report data from the Japan Council for Quality Health care collected from April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2019, including a total of 30,823 reports. In April 2020, only the 88 self-reported incidents by hospital administrative staff were downloaded, excluding incidents reported by those in medical and co-medical occupations. Data from three reports implicating pharmacists were rejected and the quantitative and textual data from the remaining 85 case reports were analyzed in terms of whether they impacted patient care directly or indirectly. RESULTS: Thirty-nine reports (45.9%) involved direct impact on patient care, while 46 (54.1%) involved indirect impact on patient care. Most incidents that directly impacted patient care involved administrative staff writing prescriptions on behalf of a doctor (n = 24, 61.5%); followed by errors related to system administration, information, and documentation (n = 7, 17.9%). Most reported errors that indirectly affected patient care were related to system administration, information, and documentation used by administrative staff (n = 22, 47.8%), or to reception (n = 9, 19.6%). Almost all errors occurred during weekdays. Most frequent incidents involved outpatients (n = 23, 27.1%), or occurred next to examination/operation rooms (n = 12, 14.1%). Further, a total of 14 cases (16.5%) involved patient misidentification. CONCLUSIONS: Incidents involving hospital administrative staff, the most common of which are medication errors from incorrect prescriptions, can lead to severe consequences for patients. Given that administrative staff now form a part of medical treatment teams, improvements in patient care may require further submission and review of incident reports involving administrative staff.","Akiyama, Naomi; Akiyama, Tomoya; Hayashida, Kenshi; Shiroiwa, Takeru; Koeda, Keisuke",BMC Health Serv Res,97,28

A significant portion is associated with the use of medical devices, with 80% of these infections being caused by a bacterial biofilm. The insertion of a foreign material usually elicits inflammation, which can result in hampered antimicrobial capacity of the host immunity due to the effort of immune cells being directed to degrade the material.

In this study, we analyzed the antibiofilm capacity of three naturally derived biofilm inhibitors when combined with immune cells in order to assess their applicability in implantable titanium devices and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) endotracheal tubes. To this end, we used a system based on the coculture of HL-60 cells differentiated into polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and Staphylococcus aureus (laboratory and clinical strains) on titanium, as well as LDPE surfaces.

Whether these are inflammations of visceral organs, joints, bones, or the like, they are always a physiological reaction of the body, which always tries to eradicate noxious agents and restore tissue homeostasis. Unfortunately, this often results in damage, often irreversible, to the affected tissues. Nevertheless, these inflammatory reactions of the body are the results of excessive stress, strain, and the generally unhealthy environment, in which the people of Western civilization live. The pathophysiology and pathobiochemistry of inflammatory/autoimmune processes are being studied in deep detail, and pharmaceutical companies are constantly developing new drugs that modulate/suppress inflammatory responses and endogenous pro-inflammatory agents. In addition to new specifically targeted drugs for a variety of pro-inflammatory agents, a strategy can be found for the use of older drugs, which are formulated into special nanodrug delivery systems with targeted distribution and often modified release. This contribution summarizes the current state of research and development of nanoformulated anti-inflammatory agents from both conventional drug classes and experimental drugs or dietary supplements used to alleviate inflammatory reactions.","Placha, Daniela; Jampilek, Josef",Pharmaceutics,97,28

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is an independent risk factor for AF. The cardioembolic stroke (CS) risk is increased when both conditions coexist. Whether angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) genetic variants predict increased risks AF and CS in Uygur patients with T2D remain elusive. METHODS: A total of 547 Uygur subjects (272 controls and 275 T2D patients) were recruited to the study from south Xinjiang. Eight ACE2 variants were identified by MassARRAY system. RESULTS: ACE2 rs2074192 (CC, adjusted RR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.35–4.80, P = 0.004), rs4240157 (CC + CT, adjusted RR = 2.26, 95% CI 1.27–4.04, P = 0.006) and rs4646188 (TT, adjusted RR = 2.37, 95% CI 1.16–4.86, P = 0.018) were associated with higher AF risk. ACE2 rs4240157 (CC + CT, adjusted RR = 2.68, 95% CI 1.36–5.27, P = 0.004) and rs4646188 (TT, adjusted RR = 2.56, 95% CI 1.06–6.20, P = 0.037) were further associated with higher CS risk. The 3 ACE2 variants were related to larger left atrial end-systolic diameter (LAD) (all P < 0.05), but not all of the 3 ACE2 variants were related to increased levels of serum sodium (rs4240157 and rs4646188, all P < 0.05), HsCRP (rs4240157 and rs4646188, all P < 0.05) as well as decreased serum potassium levels (rs2074192 and rs4646188, all P < 0.05). The 3 ACE2 variants exhibited heterogeneity on circulating RAAS activation. In particular, ACE2 rs4646188 was associated with higher levels of ACE (P = 0.017 and 0.037), Ang I (P = 0.002 and 0.001), Ang II (both P < 0.001) and ALD (P = 0.005 and 0.011). CONCLUSION: These results indicated ACE2 rs4646188 was associated with increased risk of AF and CS among diabetic patients in Uygurs, which could be a promising genetic predisposition marker for early and personalized prevention strategies for the aforementioned clinical pathologies.","Liu, Cheng; Pei, Jingxian; Lai, Yanxian; Guan, Tianwang; Zeyaweiding, Abudurexiti; Maimaiti, Tutiguli; Zhao, Haiyan; Shen, Yan",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,97,28

Furthermore, most investigations into this disease in buffaloes have only been performed with serological studies. In Brazil, particularly in the Amazon, buffalo production is growing and is just as important as cattle production, although few studies have been performed on buffalo compared to cattle. Thus, the aim of this study was to isolate and characterise Leptospira strains from river buffaloes raised in the Brazilian Amazon region. We collected 109 kidney samples from slaughtered buffaloes raised in the Amazon Delta region of Brazil. The samples were analysed by bacteriological culture for the isolation of leptospires, and the obtained isolates were serologically and molecularly characterised by microscopic agglutination test (MAT), DNA sequencing and multiple locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). Five isolates were obtained, and in serogrouping analyses, these isolates were only reactive for the Pomona serogroup, with an observed titre of 25,600. The DNA sequencing results revealed that all the isolates belonged to the species Leptospira interrogans, and the MLVA results showed that the VNTR loci 4, 7 and 10 profile of all the isolates was 4-1-10. In this study, we observed that Pomona serogroup strains circulate in buffaloes in the Amazon, showing that in Brazil, buffaloes can be affected by Leptospira strains other than the Sejroe group, which are adapted to cattle.","Guedes, Israel Barbosa; de Souza, Gisele Oliveira; de Paula Castro, Juliana Fernandes; Cavalini, Matheus Burilli; de Souza Filho, Antônio Francisco; Maia, Anderson Luiz Pinheiro; dos Reis, Eduardo Alberto; Cortez, Adriana; Heinemann, Marcos Bryan",Trop Anim Health Prod,97,28

Severe non-proliferative DR (sNPDR) is an important clinical intervention stage. Currently, panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) is the standard treatment for sNPDR. However, PRP alone cannot completely prevent NPDR progression. One explanation might be that PRP does not remove the detrimental vitreous that plays an important role in DR progression. Microinvasive pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) was shown to be a safe and effective method to treat late-stage proliferative DR (PDR) by completely removing the pathological vitreous. However, whether PPV is effective in controlling sNPDR remains unknown. In this trial, we aim to compare the effectiveness of microinvasive PPV with that of PRP for sNPDR progression control. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This single centre, parallel group, randomised controlled trial aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of microinvasive PPV in preventing the progression of sNPDR compared with PRP. A total of 272 adults diagnosed with sNPDR will be randomised 1:1 to the microinvasive PPV and PRP groups. The primary outcome is the disease progression rate, calculated as the rate of sNPDR progressed to PDR from baseline to 12 months after treatment. The secondary outcomes include the change in best-corrected visual acuity, re-treatment rate, diabetic macular oedema occurrence, change in central retinal thickness, change in the visual field, cataract occurrence and change in the quality of life.

Surveillance and risk assessments for transmission between these populations are informed by a mechanistic understanding of the pathogens in wildlife reservoirs. For avian influenza viruses (AIV), much observational and experimental work in wildlife has been conducted at local scales, yet fully understanding their spread and distribution requires assessing the mechanisms acting at both local, (e.g., intrinsic epidemic dynamics), and continental scales, (e.g., long‐distance migration). Here, we combined a large, continental‐scale data set on low pathogenic, Type A AIV in the United States with a novel network‐based application of bird banding/recovery data to investigate the migration‐based drivers of AIV and their relative importance compared to well‐characterized local drivers (e.g., demography, environmental persistence). We compared among regression models reflecting hypothesized ecological processes and evaluated their ability to predict AIV in space and time using within and out‐of‐sample validation. We found that predictors of AIV were associated with multiple mechanisms at local and continental scales. Hypotheses characterizing local epidemic dynamics were strongly supported, with age, the age‐specific aggregation of migratory birds in an area and temperature being the best predictors of infection. Hypotheses defining larger, network‐based features of the migration processes, such as clustering or between‐cluster mixing explained less variation but were also supported. Therefore, our results support a role for local processes in driving the continental distribution of AIV.","Gorsich, Erin E.; Webb, Colleen T.; Merton, Andrew A.; Hoeting, Jennifer A.; Miller, Ryan S.; Farnsworth, Matthew L.; Swafford, Seth R.; DeLiberto, Thomas J.; Pedersen, Kerri; Franklin, Alan B.; McLean, Robert G.; Wilson, Kenneth R.; Doherty, Paul F.",Ecol Appl,97,1

We studied risk factors and consequences of IPN in patients with necrotizing SAP. METHODS: The study consisted of a retrospective cohort of 163 consecutive patients treated for necrotizing SAP at a university hospital intensive care unit (ICU) between 2010 and 2018. RESULTS: All patients had experienced at least one persistent organ failure and approximately 60% had multiple organ failure within the first 24 h from admission to the ICU. Forty-seven (28.8%) patients had IPN within 90 days. Independent risk factors for IPN were more extensive anatomical spread of necrotic collections (unilateral paracolic or retromesenteric (OR 5.7, 95% CI 1.5–21.1) and widespread (OR 21.8, 95% CI 6.1–77.8)) compared to local collections around the pancreas, postinterventional pancreatitis (OR 13.5, 95% CI 2.4–76.5), preceding bacteremia (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.3–17.6), and preceding open abdomen treatment for abdominal compartment syndrome (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.4–9.3).

Moreover, the assessment of healthcare service potential access and utilization should take into account the care provided by primary and secondary services. Previous studies on the relationship between healthcare spatial accessibility and utilization often used conventional statistical methods without addressing the scale effect and spatial processes. This study investigated the impact of spatial accessibility to primary and secondary healthcare services on length of hospital stay (LOS), and the efficiency of using a geospatial approach to model this relationship. METHODS: This study focused on the ≥ 75-year-old population of the Nord administrative region of France. Inpatient hospital spatial accessibility was computed with the E2SFCA method, and then the LOS was calculated from the French national hospital activity and patient discharge database. Ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial autoregressive (SAR), and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were used to analyse the relationship between LOS and spatial accessibility to inpatient hospital care and to three primary care service types (general practitioners, physiotherapists, and home-visiting nurses). Each model performance was assessed with measures of goodness of fit. Spatial statistical methods to reduce or eliminate spatial autocorrelation in the residuals were also explored. RESULTS: GWR performed best (highest R(2) and lowest Akaike information criterion). Depending on global model (OLS and SAR), LOS was negatively associated with spatial accessibility to general practitioners and physiotherapists. GWR highlighted local patterns of spatial variation in LOS estimates. The distribution of areas in which LOS was positively or negatively associated with spatial accessibility varied when considering accessibility to general practitioners and physiotherapists. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that spatial regressions could be useful for analysing the relationship between healthcare spatial accessibility and utilization. In our case study, hospitalization of elderly people was shorter in areas with better accessibility to general practitioners and physiotherapists. This may be related to the presence of effective community healthcare services. GWR performed better than LOS and SAR. The identification by GWR of how these relationships vary spatially could bring important information for public healthcare policies, hospital decision-making, and healthcare resource allocation.","Gao, Fei; languille, Clara; karzazi, Khalil; Guhl, Mélanie; Boukebous, Baptiste; Deguen, Séverine",Int J Health Geogr,97,28

However, very few studies to date have examined how these factors contribute to QoL of youth and young adults in a stressful situation. Here, we studied the contribution of these factors, as well as of ecological momentary mood assessment, to QoL of young army recruits during their Basic Training Combat (BCT). To this end, we collected data from 156 male and female soldiers in a mixed-gender unit in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Using a mobile app installed on participants' phones, participants provided self-reports regarding their mental health status and psychological resilience at baseline, and QoL 2 weeks later. Momentary mood reporting was further collected during the 2-week interval period using a daily self-report mood scale (IMS-12). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the interrelationships among the study variables based on a hypothesized model. We found that a model with all factors (gender, resilience, mental health status and momentary mood) provided a good fit for the data based on its fit indices [χ(2)(38) = 47.506, p = 0.139, CFI = 0.979, NFI = 0.910, RMSEA = 0.040, TLI = 0.964]. However, the only direct contributors to QoL were gender and momentary mood, accounting together for 61.5% of the variance of QoL. Psychological resilience and mental health status contributed to QoL only indirectly, through their associations with momentary mood. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of ecological momentary assessment of mental-health related factors such as mood to the prediction of QoL in young adults under stress. These findings may have broader implications for monitoring and improvement of well-being in young healthy populations as well as in clinical ones.","Sinvani, Rachel-Tzofia; Fogel-Grinvald, Haya; Afek, Anat; Ben-Avraham, Rina; Davidov, Alex; Cohen, Noa Berezin; Ben Yehuda, Ariel; Nahum, Mor; Gilboa, Yafit",Front Psychiatry,97,1

About 90% of all malaria deaths in the world today occur in Sub-Saharan Africa especially in children aged < 5 years. In 2018, it was reported that there were 228 million malaria cases that resulted in 405,000 deaths from 91 countries. Currently, a fully effective and long-lasting preventive malaria vaccine is still elusive therefore more effort is needed to identify better effective vaccine candidates. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize hypothetical proteins as vaccine candidates derived from Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 genome by reverse vaccinology. RESULTS: Of the 23 selected hypothetical proteins, 5 were predicted on the extracellular localization by WoLFPSORTv.2.0 program and all the 5 had less than 2 transmembrane regions that were predicted by TMHMMv2.0 and HMMTOP programs at default settings. Two out of the five proteins lacked secretory signal peptides as predicted by SignalP program. Among the 5 extracellular proteins, 3 were predicted to be antigenic by VaxiJen (score ≥ 0.5) and had negative GRAVY values ranging from − 1.156 to − 0.440. B cell epitope prediction by ABCpred and BCpred programs revealed a total of 15 antigenic epitopes. A total of 13 cytotoxic T cells were predicted from the 3 proteins using CTLPred online server. Only 2 out of the 13 CTL were antigenic, immunogenic, non-allergenic, and non-toxic using VaxiJen, IEDB, AllergenFp, and Toxinpred servers respectively in that order. Five HTL peptides from XP_001351030.1 protein are predicted inducers of all the three cytokines. STRING protein–protein network analysis of HPs revealed XP_001350955.1 closely interacts with nucleoside diphosphate kinase (PF13-0349) at 0.704, XP_001351030.1 interacts with male development protein1 (Mdv-1) at 0.645, and XP_001351047.1 with an uncharacterized protein (MAL8P1.53) at 0.400. CONCLUSION: Reverse vaccinology is a promising strategy for the screening and identification of antigenic antigens with potential capacity to elicit cellular and humoral immune responses against P. falciparum infection. In this study, potential vaccine candidates of Plasmodium falciparum were identified and screened using standard bioinformatics tools. The vaccine candidates contained antigenic and immunogenic epitopes which could be considered for novel and effective vaccine targets. However, we strongly recommend in vivo and in vitro experiments to validate their immunogenicity and protective efficacy to completely decipher the vaccine targets against malaria.","Aguttu, Claire; Okech, Brenda Apio; Mukisa, Ambrose; Lubega, George William",J Genet Eng Biotechnol,97,28

The treatment of individuals with eating disorders can involve slow treatment progression and addressing comorbidities which can contribute to staff burnout. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has emerged as a viable treatment option and has reduced staff burnout in several other settings. Our aim was to describe frontline staff burnout using mixed methodology on a DBT-trained combined inpatient/day hospital unit for pediatric eating disorders. METHOD: Frontline staff were trained to provide DBT skills for adolescents with eating disorders. Twelve months following the training and implementation, they completed the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) and a qualitative interview. Directed and summative content analyses were used. RESULTS: Eleven frontline staff including nurses, child life specialists and child and youth workers participated. The CBI revealed that only one staff member experienced high personal burnout, while another experienced high client-related burnout. Qualitative data indicated that all frontline staff felt DBT had the potential to reduce burnout. CONCLUSION: Qualitative data indicate that staff believe that DBT may hold promise in reducing burnout for pediatric frontline staff who treat children and adolescents with eating disorders. Further study is needed. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: Understanding burnout is particularly important for nursing staff in inpatient and day hospital settings for eating disorders, as nursing staff generally have the most frequent patient contact; thought to be a risk factor for burnout. The reduction of burnout can prevent detrimental effects on job performance, personal well-being, and patient outcomes. Our exploratory study shows that frontline staff believe that DBT may have the potential to reduce burnout in staff treating children and adolescents with eating disorders in a combined inpatient/day hospital setting.

METHODS: Between January 2020 and March 2021, 13 patients were treated on a phase 1, open-label, 3+3 design, dose-escalation study at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. The study population was adults with advanced solid tumors and was enriched for chordoma, a rare sarcoma of the notochord that overexpresses brachyury. Vaccine was administered intravenously at three DLs on days 1, 22, and 43. Blood samples were taken to assess drug pharmacokinetics and immune activation. Imaging was conducted at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months post-treatment. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability as determined by the frequency of dose-limiting toxicities; a secondary endpoint was determination of the recommended phase 2 dose. RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicities were observed and no serious adverse events were attributed to the vaccine. Vaccine-related toxicities were consistent with class profile (ie, influenza-like symptoms). Cytokine release syndrome up to grade 2 was observed with no adverse outcomes. Dose-effect trend was observed for fever, chills/rigor, and hypotension. Efficacy analysis of objective response rate per RECIST 1.1 at the end of study showed one patient with a partial response, four with stable disease, and eight with progressive disease. Three patients with stable disease experienced clinical benefit in the form of improvement in pain. Immune correlatives showed T cell activation against brachyury and other tumor-associated cascade antigens. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous administration of MVA-BN-brachyury-TRICOM vaccine was safe and tolerable. Maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The maximum administered dose was 10(9) infectious units every 3 weeks for three doses. This dose was selected as the recommended phase 2 dose.

This study aimed to identify critical factors affecting the efficacy of peracetic acid (PAA)‐based disinfectants and products containing either hydrogen peroxide or sodium hypochlorite under the same conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: The influence of concentration, application (contact) time, erroneous human behaviour, interfering substance, technical assets and weather conditions on disinfection efficacy against Bacillus subtilis spores were assessed in 14 experimental groups. Residual contamination of protective suits was measured to provide responders with readily understandable information (up to 100 colony forming units classified a suit as disinfected). Weather conditions, short application time and erroneous human behaviour substantially affected the effectiveness of PAAs (P < 0·05). Non‐PAA‐based disinfectants (either liquid or foam) did not reach comparable efficacy (P < 0·001). CONCLUSIONS: Peracetic acid was effective at a concentration of 6400–8200 ppm and an application time of 4 min. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study provides operationally relevant data for the use of PAA‐based disinfectants in preparedness planning and management of biological incidents and natural outbreaks.","Rybka, A.; Gavel, A.; Kroupa, T.; Meloun, J.; Prazak, P.; Draessler, J.; Pavlis, O.; Kubickova, P.; Kratzerova, L.; Pejchal, J.",J Appl Microbiol,97,1

LSAS is a relatively safe industrial byproduct with similar polyanionic characteristics to that of heparin. Human plasma clotting assays, fibrin polymerization testing, and enzyme inhibition assays were exploited to investigate the anticoagulant activity of LSAS. In normal human plasma, LSAS selectively doubled the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) at ~308 µg/mL. Equally, LSAS doubled APTT at ~275 µg/mL in antithrombin-deficient plasma. Yet, LSAS doubled APTT at a higher concentration of 429 µg/mL using factor XI-deficient plasma. LSAS did not affect FXIIIa-mediated fibrin polymerization at 1000 µg/mL. Enzyme assays revealed that LSAS inhibits factor XIa (FXIa) with an IC(50) value of ~8 μg/mL. LSAS did not inhibit thrombin, factor IXa, factor Xa, factor XIIIa, chymotrypsin, or trypsin at the highest concentrations tested and demonstrated significant selectivity against factor XIIa and plasmin. In Michaelis–Menten kinetics, LSAS decreased the V(MAX) of FXIa hydrolysis of a tripeptide chromogenic substrate without significantly changing its K(M) indicating an allosteric inhibition mechanism. The inhibitor also disrupted the generation of FXIa–antithrombin complex, inhibited factor XIIa-mediated and thrombin-mediated activation of the zymogen factor XI to FXIa, and competed with heparin for binding to FXIa. Its action appears to be reversed by protamine sulfate. Structure–activity relationship studies demonstrated the advantageous selectivity and allosteric behavior of LSAS over the acetylated and desulfonated derivatives of LSAS. LSAS is a sulfonated heparin mimetic that demonstrates significant anticoagulant activity in human plasma. Overall, it appears that LSAS is a potent, selective, and allosteric inhibitor of FXIa with significant anticoagulant activity in human plasma. Altogether, this study introduces LSAS as a promising lead for further development as an anticoagulant.","Kar, Srabani; Bankston, Page; Afosah, Daniel K.; Al-Horani, Rami A.",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),97,1

However, the relationship between the severity of the patient's organ damage and the survival benefit of PMX treatment is not clear. METHODS: We analyzed the efficacy of PMX on adult sepsis patients using the propensity score matching method and the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) national inpatient database from April 2018 to March 2020. We stratified the patients into five categories based on their baseline Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and compared the mortality between PMX-treated and non-treated groups in each category. We also compared continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF)-, ventilator- and noradrenaline-free days between the groups. RESULTS: Of 44,177 patients included in the study, 2191 received PMX. After 1:1 propensity score matching, we created matched cohorts of 2033 pairs. PMX significantly improved the survival of the patients in the SOFA score categories of 7–9 and 10–12. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the survival rate in SOFA score categories of 0–6, 13–15, and 16–24. In analyzing organ support-free days, PMX was also beneficial in the 7–9 and 10–12 SOFA categories compared to other categories. CONCLUSION: Analysis of a large-scale Japanese inpatient database found a significant association between PMX efficacy and baseline SOFA score. This result indicates higher efficacy in patients with medium SOFA scores in the range of 7–12. The result provides a promising hypothesis for selecting appropriate patients for PMX and should be validated in future RCTs.

Its ligand, CD95L, was initially detected at the plasma membrane of activated T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells where it contributes to the elimination of transformed and infected cells. Given its implication in immune homeostasis and immune surveillance combined with the fact that various lineages of malignant cells exhibit loss-of-function mutations, CD95 was initially classified as a tumor suppressor gene. Nonetheless, in different pathophysiological contexts, this receptor is able to transmit non-apoptotic signals and promote inflammation and carcinogenesis. Although the different non-apoptotic signaling pathways (NF-κB, MAPK, and PI3K) triggered by CD95 are known, the initial molecular events leading to these signals, the mechanisms by which the receptor switches from an apoptotic function to an inflammatory role, and, more importantly, the biological functions of these signals remain elusive.","Fouqué, Amélie; Legembre, Patrick",Cancer Immunology,97,1

These experimental approaches take advantage of a variety of observables. Changes in the protein aggregation pattern have been monitored through fluorescence properties such as spectra, intensities (related to quantum yields), time-decays, and anisotropies of intrinsic protein fluorophores, of extrinsic fluorescent tags and, even, of the same small molecules added to modulate PPIs, as well as through bimolecular excited-state processes such as static and collisional quenching, including electron and excitation-energy transfer, or exciton interaction, whose efficiencies are crucially structure dependent. Besides allowing for qualitative and quantitative information on the small-molecule induced PPI modulation, these approaches can take advantage from the sensitivity of fluorescence observables on fine structural details to shed light on the molecular-scale mechanisms of action and their functional consequences. Direct investigation of the latter by kinetic inhibition analysis represents a useful change in perspective whenever PPI are relevant for enzyme activity.

One approach is in silico drug design based on our existing knowledge of the biology of a specific disease and the specific target site binding chemistry. Based on this knowledge, a range of molecules will be designed and synthesised after which they will be tested in in vitro bioassays for activity and toxicity. The best candidates, called lead compounds, will then be “fine-tuned” by chemical derivatisation in order to improve their activity and/or to reduce their toxicity. Lead compounds are then tested in various animal models before entering clinical trials in people. Another approach is to screen a large number of biological samples (plants, bacteria and fungi) for activity against a specific disease. Any active extract, consisting of many compounds, will be fractionated by chromatographic techniques, and each fraction will be tested for in vitro activity. Active fractions will again be fractionated until the active compound is identified. This process, also called bioguided fractionation, can go through a number of fractionation cycles before the active compound is identified. The active compound will be chemically derivatised in order to improve its properties before in vivo animal studies will be conducted. Based on these test results, the most promising lead compounds will then be tested in clinical trials in people. There are however a number of shortcomings with both approaches. It is expensive, time consuming, makes use of in vitro bioassays and it suffers from a very low success rate. Due to these shortcomings, it is currently estimated that the development of one new drug costs around $1–1.5 billion, simply because so many lead compounds fail during clinical trials. Keeping these high costs in mind, one would think that all registered drugs are effective and importantly non-toxic. Unfortunately, this is not the case, as there are a number of drugs currently on the market that are causing severe side effects and whose efficacy should be questioned. This holds true particularly for cancer chemotherapeutics. It was estimated that cancer chemotherapy improves the average 5-year survival rate of patients (for all cancer types) by only 2 % (Morgan et al. 2004). Another relatively unknown fact is that each year, 200,000 people die in the EU due to adverse drug reactions (all types of drugs), highlighting the severe shortcomings of the drug development and drug licensing pipelines (Archibald and Coleman 2012). To put this into perspective, there are a large number of drugs that work perfectly well and are safe to use, but we have to concede that our approach to drug discovery and our overall approach to health care suffers from some major problems.","van der Kooy, Frank",Artemisia annua - Pharmacology and Biotechnology,97,1

This is very time-consuming, which is why circumstances such as lack of time and personnel can make implementation difficult. In other areas, agile approaches have already proven to be effective in enabling flexible and efficient development. We use this opportunity to overcome different barriers in the context of FC development by creating an agile model for FC development. To achieve this, we first examined the previous research on agile development approaches concerning the implementation of an FC by a systematic literature review, concluding that no appropriate model exists yet. Building upon this, we designed an Agile(FC) Development Model, which can be used by teachers to create their FC. This model is very generally designed so that it can be easily adopted. On the other hand, it can be adjusted to a particular situation without effort. We also illustrate the application of the model using a small case study.","Blömer, Linda; Voigt, Christin; Droit, Alena; Hoppe, Uwe","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",97,20

This results in Th2‐biased immune responses. The nature of IFN‐β‐modulated DC remains elusive. Previously, we observed that IFN‐β dose dependently induces expression of CD123, i.e. a classical marker for plasmacytoid DC, on human blood monocyte‐derived myeloid DC. Such IFN‐β‐modulated DC produce predominantly IL‐10 but are IL‐12 deficient, with potent Th2 promotion. In the present study, we further characterize IFN‐β‐modulated DC by using recently identified blood DC antigens (BDCA) and investigate their ability to produce Type I IFN in response to virus stimulation. We show that IFN‐β induces development of CD123(+) DC from human blood monocytes, which coexpress BDCA4(+) but are negative for BDCA2(–), a specific marker for plasmacytoid DC. Such IFN‐β‐modulated DC produce large amounts of IL‐6 and IL‐10, but no IL‐12p40 and have no enhanced IFN‐β and IFN‐β production. The findings indicate that IFN‐β‐modulated DC represent a myeloid DC subset with diminished CD11c, BDCA‐1 and CD1a expression, having potent Th2‐promoting function but lacking antiviral capacity.","Huang, Y.

In this context, some authors consider that health-related industries will be more likely to generate new technological systems than defense-related industries, which have entered a stage of technological maturity (Ruttan 2006; Steinbock 2014; among others). Based on evolutionary works, in this paper we state that technological systems are characterized by a high degree of technological relatedness, which is positively associated with the possibility of a system to generate variety through the recombination of knowledge from a common base. Following this statement, this work aims to analyze technological relatedness between defense (and health) technological system(s) and other groups of products to compare their variety patterns. Based on international trade data (a panel for 60 countries and 17 years), and different measures of proximity and relatedness (e.g. sectoral competitiveness of countries), we compare defense and health technological systems regarding their potential of generating related variety through two main methods: network analysis and econometrical analysis. The main results support Ruttan’s hypothesis. The network analysis shows the potential for both systems to generate related variety, but higher centrality indicators for health products. In line with that, competitiveness in health products presents a stronger correlation with competitiveness in other groups of products, both related and high and medium technology. This suggests that an improvement in countries’ competitiveness in health sectors can generate spillovers on other related sectors, which can strengthen structural competitiveness and sustain long-term growth.","Vázquez, Darío",J Evol Econ,97,28

A subanalysis was carried out in one of the hospitals by measuring C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and proadrenomedullin (proADM) at admission, at day 5 and at day 30. RESULTS: A total of 312 patients were included, 150 in the control group and 162 in the intervention group. Ninety day, 180 day and 1-year mortality in the per-protocol analysis were 8 (2.57%), 10 (3.22%) and 14 (4.50%), respectively. There were no significant differences between both groups in terms of 1-year mortality (p = 0.94), new admissions (p = 0.84) or cardiovascular events (p = 0.33). No differences were observed between biomarker level differences from day 5 to day 30 (CRP p = 0.29; PCT p = 0.44; proADM p = 0.52). CONCLUSIONS: Reducing antibiotic treatment in hospitalized patients with CAP based on clinical stability criteria is safe, without leading to a greater number of long-term complications.","Uranga MD, Ane; Artaraz MD, Amaia; Bilbao MD, Amaia; Quintana MD, Jose María; Arriaga MD, Ignacio; Intxausti MD, Maider; Lobo MD, Jose Luis; García MD, Julia Amaranta; Camino MD, Jesus; España MD, Pedro Pablo",BMC Pulm Med,97,22

The aim of this paper is to briefly review the situation that COVID-19 has caused in the environment and sustainability. In addition, a critical view of it is provided, and possible solutions for a sustainable economic reconstruction are offered. The coronavirus is revealing the fragility of the current economic system, based on profit and continuous consumption of resources. This model generates many problems such as pollution, contribution to climate change, loss of biodiversity or unfair distribution of wealth. This must be an opportunity to redefine the social purpose of business and help generate a sustainable world through economic policies.

Prediction of metal solubility in polluted soils and the subsequent transfer of these metals from soil pore water to the human food supply via crops are required for effective risk assessment from polluted soils. Thus an attempt has been made to develop a novel approach to protect human health from exposure to toxic metals through assessing risk from metal polluted soils utilised for agriculture. In this study, we assess the relative efficacy of various forms of ‘free ion activity model’ (FIAM) for predicting the concentration of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) in spinach and wheat as example crops, thereby providing an assessment of risk to human health from consumption of these crops. Free metal ion activity in soil solution was estimated using the Windermere Humic Aqueous Model VII (WHAM-VII) and the Baker soil test. Approximately 91, 81, 75, 94 and 70% of the variability in Cd, Pb, Ni, Zn and Cu content, respectively, of spinach could be described by a FIAM using an estimate of the free ion activity of the metals provided by WHAM-VII. Owing to the different concentration of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) used in the present experiment, higher prediction coefficients were obtained using EDTA (0.05 M), rather than DTPA (0.005 M), as the metal extractant in an integrated solubility-FIAM model. Out of three formulations, the FIAM, based on free ion activity of metals in soil pore water, determined from solution extracted with Rhizon samplers, was distinctly superior to the other formulations in predicting metal uptake by spinach and wheat. A safe level of extractable metal in soil was prescribed using a hazard quotient derived from predicted plant metal content and estimated dietary intake of wheat and spinach by a human population.

Unlike most of the world, sub-Saharan African countries have reported only minimal progress, one that the COVID-19 pandemic has unfortunately disrupted. Transdisciplinary research (TDR) has been conceptualized as important for achieving sustainability goals such as the SDGs. In this paper we (i) analyze the contributions of the five TDR projects toward the achievements of the SDGs at the city level in Africa, and (ii) explore the interactions between the assessed SDGs across the five projects. The projects’ contributions towards the achievements of the SDGs were examined in three thematic areas: (i) contexts, (ii) processes and (iii) products. The five projects were funded under the Leading Integrated Research for Agenda 2030 in Africa (LIRA) programme. The projects were being implemented in nine cities across five African countries Accra (Ghana), Kumasi (Ghana), Korhogo (Ivory Coast), Abuja Metro (Nigeria), Mbour (Senegal), Cape Town (South Africa), Nelson Mandela Bay Metro (South Africa), Grahamstown (South Africa) and Kampala (Uganda) and data were collected on each of the five projects in these cities. The contextual contributions include co-analysis and reflection on policy and institutional silos and social innovations amenable to contextual complexity. A shift in how actors perceived and conceptualized sustainability challenges and the role of the projects as transformative social agents constituted the two main process contributions. Tool development, virtual models and maps, and handbook are the product contributions by the projects. Our analysis of the SDG interactions indicated the need for cross-sectoral collaborations to ensures resource use efficiency, knowledge and experience sharing, and seamless flow of information and data to accelerate the SDG implementation.","Thiam, Sokhna; Aziz, Fati; Kushitor, Sandra Boatemaa; Amaka-Otchere, Akosua Baah Kwarteng; Onyima, Blessing Nonye; Odume, Oghenekaro Nelson",Sustain Sci,97,7

In our effort the non-PDE4 inhibitor isocoumarins were transformed into the promising inhibitors via introducing an aminosulfonyl/aminocarboxamide moiety to the C-3 benzene ring attached to the isocoumarin framework. This new class of isocoumarins were synthesized via a PdCl2-catalyzed construction of the 4-allyl substituted 3-aryl isocoumarin ring starting from the appropriate 2-alkynyl benzamide derivative. Several compounds showed good inhibition of PDE4B in vitro and the SAR indicated superiority of aminosulfonamide moiety over aminocarboxamide in terms of PDE4B inhibition. Two compounds 3q and 3u with PDE4B IC50 = 0.43 ± 0.11 and 0.54 ± 0.19 μM and ≥ 2-fold selectivity over PDE4D emerged as initial hits. The participation of aminosulfonamide moiety in PDE4B inhibition and the reason for selectivity though moderate shown by 3q and 3u was revealed by the in silico docking studies. In view of potential usefulness of moderately selective PDE4B inhibitors the compound 3u (that showed PDE4 selectivity over other PDEs) was further evaluated in adjuvant induced arthritic rats. At an intraperitoneal dose of 30 mg/kg the compound showed a significant reduction in paw swelling (in a dose dependent manner), inflammation and pannus formation (in the knee joints) as well as pro-inflammatory gene expression/mRNA levels and increase in body weight. Moreover, besides its TNF-α inhibition and no significant toxicity in an MTT assay the compound did not show any adverse effects in a thorough toxicity studies e.g. teratogenicity, hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity and apoptosis in zebrafish. Thus, the isocoumarin 3u emerged as a new, safe and moderately selective PDE4B inhibitor could be useful for inflammatory diseases possibly including COVID-19.","Thirupataiah, B; Mounika, Guntipally; Reddy, Gangireddy Sujeevan; Kumar, Jetta Sandeep; Hossain, Kazi Amirul; Medishetti, Raghavender; Samarpita, Snigdha; Rasool, Mahaboobkhan; Mudgal, Jayesh; Mathew, Jessy E; Shenoy, Gautham G; Rao, C Mallikarjuna; Chatti, Kiranam; Parsa, Kishore V L; Pal, Manojit",European journal of medicinal chemistry,97,33

Methods In an experimental set up, various steps of vitreoretinal surgery were performed on enucleated goat eyes. The main outcome measures were visualization, quantification of size, and calculation of aerosol spread. Results During intravitreal injection, insertion of cannulas, lensectomy, and vitrectomy with both 23 and 25-gauge instruments, with either valved or nonvalved cannulas, aerosols were not visualized which was confirmed on imaging. Although there was no aerosol generation during active fluid air exchange (FAE), there was bubbling and aerosol generation at the exit port of the handle during passive FAE. Under higher air pressure, with reused valved and fresh nonvalved cannulas, aerosol generation showed a trajectory 0.4 to 0.67 m with droplet size of 200 microns. Whereas removing cannulas or suturing under active air infusion (35 mm Hg and above) aerosols were noted. Conclusions Based on the above experiments, we can formulate guidelines for safe vitrectomy during COVID-19. Some recommendations include the use of valved cannulas, avoiding passive FAE or to direct the exit port away from the surgeon and assistant, and to maintain the air pressure less than or equal to 30 mm Hg. Translational Relevance In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk from virus laden aerosols, as determined using an experimental setup, appears to be low for commonly performed vitreoretinal surgical procedures.","Jayadev, Chaitra; Mochi Basavaraj, Thirumalesh; Pandey, Khushboo; Pinto, Roven; Pandey, Shashi Prabha; Basu, Saptarshi; Roy, Abhijit Sinha; Shetty, Rohit",Translational vision science & technology,97,16

Standard therapy with high-dose glucocorticoids and etoposide used in adults is extrapolated from pediatric trials, with significant toxicity in older patients and those with poor performance status. The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib has recently gained attention as a treatment option for HLH due to its broad cytokine-modulating abilities and safety profile. Herein we report our center's experience using ruxolitinib in the treatment of adult-onset secondary HLH. CASE SERIES We report four patients with profound secondary HLH provoked by diverse triggers, including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis on background systemic lupus erythematosus, disseminated tuberculosis, and T-cell lymphoma treated with ruxolitinib as monotherapy or combination therapy in upfront and salvage settings. RESULTS All four patients had rapid, sustained improvement in clinical status, inflammatory markers and hematological cell counts followed by durable remission. Three patients developed manageable infectious complications post ruxolitinib. CONCLUSIONS This series demonstrates the effective use of JAK inhibition with ruxolitinib to control pathological immune activation in critically ill patients with secondary HLH and otherwise limited therapeutic options. JAK inhibition is also an area of urgent investigation for the treatment of cytokine storm associated with COVID-19.","Hansen, Sarah; Alduaij, Waleed; Biggs, Catherine M; Belga, Sara; Luecke, Kai; Merkeley, Hayley; Chen, Luke Y C",European journal of haematology,97,1

Bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST-2; also known as CD317 or tetherin) was initially identified to be a pre-B-cell growth promoter, but it also inhibits the release of virions of the retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by tethering budding virions to the host cell membrane. Further work has shown that BST-2 restricts the release of many other viruses, including the human coronavirus 229E (hCoV-229E), and the genomes of many of these viruses encode BST-2 antagonists to overcome BST-2 restriction. Given the previous studies on BST-2, we aimed to determine if BST-2 has the ability to restrict SARS-CoV and if the SARS-CoV genome encodes any proteins that modulate BST-2's antiviral function. Through an in vitro screen, we identified four potential BST-2 modulators encoded by the SARS-CoV genome: the papain-like protease (PLPro), nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1), ORF6, and ORF7a. As the function of ORF7a in SARS-CoV replication was previously unknown, we focused our study on ORF7a. We found that BST-2 does restrict SARS-CoV, but the loss of ORF7a leads to a much greater restriction, confirming the role of ORF7a as an inhibitor of BST-2. We further characterized the mechanism of BST-2 inhibition by ORF7a and found that ORF7a localization changes when BST-2 is overexpressed and ORF7a binds directly to BST-2. Finally, we also show that SARS-CoV ORF7a blocks the restriction activity of BST-2 by blocking the glycosylation of BST-2. IMPORTANCE The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged from zoonotic sources in 2002 and caused over 8,000 infections and 800 deaths in 37 countries around the world. Identifying host factors that regulate SARS-CoV pathogenesis is critical to understanding how this lethal virus causes disease. We have found that BST-2 is capable of restricting SARS-CoV release from cells; however, we also identified a SARS-CoV protein that inhibits BST-2 function. We show that the SARS-CoV protein ORF7a inhibits BST-2 glycosylation, leading to a loss of BST-2's antiviral function.","Taylor, Justin K; Coleman, Christopher M; Postel, Sandra; Sisk, Jeanne M; Bernbaum, John G; Venkataraman, Thiagarajan; Sundberg, Eric J; Frieman, Matthew B",Journal of virology,97,1

The effect of varying sample volume on detection sensitivity was investigated using serial 10-fold dilutions of pure viral specimens and target nucleic acids were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Little variability in detection sensitivity was observed for all the viral targets tested, although variation in cycle threshold values was apparent in some cases. Importantly, pathogens were detectable over a broad concentration range and from diverse clinical specimens. Removal of PCR inhibitors was generally effective, as demonstrated by detection of viral nucleic acids and/or internal controls. The results demonstrate that the QIAsymphony SP is suitable for use in routine virology molecular diagnostics, and provides a high-throughput capacity, which is needed in peak seasons of infection or in centralised laboratories.","Parham, N J; Parmar, S A; Kumar, N; Aliyu, S; Curran, M D; Zhang, H",British journal of biomedical science,97,11

Methods A simple protein precipitation was carried out using 75 µL of methanol containing the internal standard (IS) remdesivir-13C6 and 5 µL ZnSO4 1 M. After separation on Kinetex® 2.6 µm Polar C18 100A LC column (100 × 2.1 mm i.d.), both compounds were detected by a mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization in positive mode. The ion transitions used were m/z 603.3 → m/z 200.0 and m/z 229.0 for remdesivir, m/z 292.2 → m/z 173.1 and m/z 147.1 for GS-441524 and m/z 609.3 → m/z 206.0 for remdesivir-13C6. Results Calibration curves were linear in the 1-5000 μg/L range for remdesivir and 5-2500 for GS-441524, with limit of detection set at 0.5 and 2 μg/L and limit of quantification at 1 and 5 μg/L, respectively. Precisions evaluated at 2.5, 400 and 4000 μg/L for remdesivir and 12.5, 125, 2000 μg/L for GS-441524 were lower than 14.7% and accuracy was in the [89.6-110.2%] range. A slight matrix effect was observed, compensated by IS. Higher stability of remdesivir and metabolite was observed on NaF-plasma. After 200 mg IV single administration, remdesivir concentration decrease rapidly with a half-life less than 1 h while GS-441524 appeared rapidly and decreased slowly until H24 with a half-life around 12 h.

They significantly impact the quality of life of the patient. They are one of the most common causes of benign biliary strictures, which can result in serious complications such as recurrent cholangitis or secondary biliary cirrhosis. Although LC is a common operation today, the incidence of BDIs associated with LC is twice that of BDIs resulting from open cholecystectomies. CASE REPORT In this paper, we present a case report of a patient after LC with the Class III-D injury according to the Stewart-Way classification. The injury was a result of a misleading description from a preoperative ultrasonography and a subsequent misunderstanding of the anatomical conditions of a patient with congenital gallbladder agenesis. The BDI was recognised first day after surgery. Thanks to a prompt transfer to our centre the patient was in a good condition. Biliary reconstruction could be done because there was no serious inflammation or biliary peritonitis at the time of reoperation. Due to the extent of the injury a Roux-en-Y tri-hepaticojejunostomy combined with external transhepatic biliary drains was performed. CONCLUSION Iatrogenic BDI after a LC is a rare, but potentially life-threatening complication. The main risk factor is the presence of anatomical variants of the biliary tract. Early recognition and treatment in a department with adequately experienced hepatobiliary specialists are crucial for a positive outcome. The most frequent surgical treatment is a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.","Drs, A; Kocík, M; Chlupac, J; Froněk, J",Rozhledy v chirurgii : mesicnik Ceskoslovenske chirurgicke spolecnosti,97,8

Male SPF Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups for this experiment, control group (altitude, 1400 m, temperature, 25 ℃), NC + 2 ℃ group (altitude, 1400 m, temperature, 2 ℃), HH group (altitude, 6000 m, temperature, 25 ℃), HH+2 ℃ group (altitude, 6000 m, temperature, 2 ℃) and HH + 12/2 ℃ (altitude, 6000 m, temperature, 12 ℃/2 ℃ light/dark cycle). After exposure for 72 h, the blood and brain tissues were collected. Brain water content (BWC) and Evans Blue dye extravasation were used to assess the brain edema and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, respectively. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum were assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Oxidative stress markers and ATPase activity were determined using commercial kits. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of related proteins. Compared to control, HH+2 ℃ could significantly increase the BWC and BBB permeability, and these changes were further exacerbated by HH + 12/2 ℃. Furthermore, HH+2 ℃ and HH + 12/2 ℃ markedly increased the levels of H2O2 and MDA, restrained SOD and GSH levels and decreased Na+/K+-ATPase activitie compared with the control group. In addition, HH+2 ℃ and HH + 12/2 ℃ enhanced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 in serum and significantly increased the expression of VEGF in brain compared with the control group, but only HH + 12/2 ℃ could increase the expression of AQP4. However, compared with control group, no significant differences in these parameters were observed in HH and NC+2 ℃groups. These results demonstrated that HH or cold stress alone did not successfully induce brain damage, while HH+2 ℃ could induce the onset of HACE via provoking injury caused by HH. HH + 12/2 ℃ was more obvious and efficient. Collectively, we firstly suggest that cold stress may promote the formation of HACE by aggravating the brain injury induced by HH exposure and supply an effective and reliable experimental rat model of HACE via HH combined with temperature fluctuation.","Jing, Linlin; Wu, Ningzi; He, Lei; Shao, Jin; Ma, Huiping",Brain research bulletin,97,30

It was later found to have immunomodulating, anti-infective, anti-thrombotic, anti-tumor, and metabolic effects. Recently, many studies have focused on the application of chloroquine in viral infections. Most in vitro studies suggested that chloroquine exerted some benefit in infections from viruses. However, animal experiment and clinical trials that attempted to use chloroquine in prevention or treatment of viral infections have reported disappointing results. It might be attributable to inadequate steady-state whole blood chloroquine concentration necessary for exerting its antiviral effects. A 16 μM/L steady-state whole blood concentration of chloroquine should suffice in antiviral treatment with minimal toxicity. Furthermore, chloroquine has both acute and cumulative toxicity. Hence, not only the appropriate treatment dose is crucial, the occurrence of adverse reactions should also be closely monitored and treated in time. Herein, we report the antiviral mechanisms, effects, safety and adverse effects of chloroquine.","Wei, Z-X; Tang, T-T; Jiang, S-P",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,97,16

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A prospective observational cohort study of 410 consecutive pregnant women with preexisting diabetes categorized according to aspirin prophylaxis strategy, with the prevalence of preeclampsia as primary outcome. In total, 207 women were included after implementation of prophylactic aspirin for all pregnant women with preexisting diabetes in February 2018 (all-cohort). The 203 women included before this date, where aspirin prophylaxis was risk based and only prescribed to selected women (selected-cohort), were studied for comparison. RESULTS Aspirin was prescribed at ∼10 gestational weeks for 88% (all-cohort) compared with 25% (selected-cohort). HbA1c, parity, chronic hypertension, home blood pressure, microalbuminuria/diabetic nephropathy, and smoking were similar in the two cohorts in early pregnancy. In the all-cohort, fewer women had type 2 diabetes (32% vs. 42%, respectively; P = 0.04) and BMI tended to be lower (P = 0.05). The prevalence of preeclampsia was similar (12% vs. 11%, P = 0.69) in the two cohorts, and this was also the case with stratification for diabetes type. Prevalence of preterm delivery <37 weeks (23% vs. 27%, P = 0.30), preterm preeclampsia (7% vs. 7%, P = 0.96), and infants large (40% vs. 32%, P = 0.07) and small (7% vs. 6%, P = 0.88) for gestational age was similar in the two cohorts.

The aim of this review is to investigate the role of surgical masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods - A literature research was conducted via PubMed to detect articles featuring the potential protective role of surgical masks when they were worn by healthcare workers or by the general public. Results - Among 114 articles, only 31 met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen additional articles provided useful information according to the aim of this review. Existing literature supports the positive effect of surgical masks on COVID-19 con-lamination. Debate on the efficacy of surgical masks compared with other forms of facial protective devices exists. There seems to be a tendency to favor the use of particulate-filtering facepiece respirators in healthcare professionals who face higher risk of infection. However, surgical masks primarily and cloth masks secondarily seem to be adequate means of protection for the general public and for healthcare workers during procedures where respiratory droplets are not generated. Rational use of surgical masks is imperative; however, reuse after decontamination is not ideal. Conclusions - For optimum protection from COVID-19, the use of surgical masks should be combined with other infection control measures like hand hygiene and social distancing, since the level of their effectiveness is still being investigated. Shortage of surgical masks should be prevented; therefore, rational use plays a crucial role in this direction.","Solia, Eirini; Angelis, Stavros; Maglara, Elli; Tsakotos, Georgios; Filippou, Dimitrios K",Journal of long-term effects of medical implants,97,1

We hypothesized that altered lymphatic drainage makes traditional determination of resection margins inadequate. METHODS One hundred and seventy patients underwent cytoreductive surgery for neuroendocrine tumors from November 2006 to August 2008. Forty-nine patients underwent intra-operative lymphatic mapping with lymphazurin dye as a single agent. Twenty-seven patients had midgut primaries. We reviewed operative findings and pathology to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lymphatic mapping for midgut carcinoids. Lymphatic mapping defined resection margins were compared to traditional surgical margins. RESULTS There were no adverse events associated with the 49 lymphatic mapping procedures. Twenty-five (92%) patients had ileal and 2 had jejunal primaries. Lymphatic mapping changed traditional resection margins in 88% of patients. We preserved the ileocecal valve in 6 of 15 (40%) of patients with terminal ileal primaries. CONCLUSION Lymphatic mapping seems to be a safe, time efficient, and effective way to determine adequate resection margins for midgut carcinoids. We advocate using lymphatic mapping for patients with midgut carcinoids to identify adequate resection margins and assist in preservation of the ileocecal valve in patients with terminal ileal primary carcinoids.","Wang, Yi-Zarn; Joseph, Saju; Lindholm, Erika; Lyons, John; Boudreaux, J Philip; Woltering, Eugene A",Surgery,97,14

The study explores the strategies employed by tobacco companies through their retailer programmes in Banyuwangi, Indonesia. METHODS In 2019 we conducted observation and indepth interviews with the owners/keepers of 12 retailers with Sampoerna Retail Community (SRC) signs and 6 retailers with Gudang Garam Strategic Partnership signs placed as store names in front of their stores. We analysed the data to identify key strategies used by each tobacco company. RESULTS Gudang Garam promoted more visibility of their own products, while Sampoerna promoted their products in a power wall and also rearranged other products sold in the store to attract more customers. Sampoerna educated their retailers to attract and retain more customers by using schemes such as reward points and coupons. Sampoerna also developed and promoted the use of a mobile application for online sales. CONCLUSIONS Both programmes promote product and brand display at retailers to create brand loyalty. The SRC mobile application for online sales is potentially attractive to young customers and allows for data collection about retail and customer purchase behaviours that can be used for tailored marketing. Tobacco sales promotion strategies should be strongly regulated. Banning indoor tobacco advertisement, promotion and tobacco display at POS should be encouraged.","Azzahro, Eqia Arum; Dewi, Desak Made Sintha Kurnia; Puspikawati, Septa Indra; Handayani, Rizky Putri; Ayodya, Gayatri; Prayogi, Ahmad Rido'i Yuda; Sebayang, Susy K",Tobacco control,97,4

ABT can lead to increased function and improved quality of life; however, research and clinical settings currently lack tools to track participation in ABT. As a first step towards developing such a tool, a scoping review will be conducted with the objective of identifying the characteristics of ABT that individuals with SCI/D participate in across the continuum of care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review framework. Studies that involve at least two sessions of ABT for individuals with SCI/D aged ≥16 years will be included.

The objective of this study was to estimate the economic burden of pancreatic cancer for the years 2018 and 2030 based on changing demographics and incidence rates in Sweden. METHOD The incidence of pancreatic cancer in Sweden and additional relevant data were obtained from official statistics. A linear regression model and the mean incidence rates 2008-2018 were applied to calculate the incidence in 2030. An economic model based on the human capital method was created to calculate the indirect cost of pancreatic cancer in 2018 and 2030. Costs associated with surgery, radiology, oncology, and palliative care constituted the direct costs. A sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS The incidence of pancreatic cancer in Sweden in the year 2018 was 1352 patients and projected to between 1554 (+15%) and 1736 (+28%) in 2030. The total cost was calculated to €125 million in 2018 and between €210 million (+68%) and €225 million (+80%) in 2030. The indirect cost in the ≤65-year-old group was €328,344 in 2018 and between €380,738 and €382,109 per individual in 2030. CONCLUSIONS The economic burden of pancreatic cancer is expected to increase in Sweden by 2030 due to the increasing incidence of the disease and changing demographics.

However, symptoms are inherently less specific than mucosal disease and, as noted by Herregods et al. in their contribution appearing in this issue of Neurogastroenterology and Motility, patients with refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms often do not have GERD. This review discusses potential etiologies for PPI-refractory symptoms. Three major concepts are explored: subendoscopic esophagitis, weakly acidic reflux events, and alternative explanations for persistent symptoms. With respect to subendoscopic esophagitis and unsuppressed reflux, ample evidence exists that these are present in PPI-refractory patients. The problem is that these findings are also often present in substantial numbers of individuals with a satisfactory response to PPI therapy. Hence, the emphasis shifts to determinants of symptom perception. The major conclusion of the review is that psychogenic factors such as hyperalgesia, allodynia, hypervigilance, and heightened anxiety are the most plausible explanations as the dominant determinants of PPI-refractory symptoms.","Kahrilas, P J; Keefer, L; Pandolfino, J E",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,97,1

We then investigated associations of the identified moisture damage indicators with respiratory symptoms in more than 2700 students. Finally, we explored whether exposure to specific taxa within the indoor microbiota may explain the association between moisture damage and respiratory health. Schools were assessed for moisture damage through detailed inspections, and the microbial composition of settled dust in electrostatic dustfall collectors was determined using marker-gene analysis. In Finland, there were several positive associations between particular microbial indicators (diversity, richness, individual taxa) and a respiratory symptom score, while in the Netherlands, the associations tended to be mostly inverse and statistically non-significant. In Finland, abundance of the Sphingomonas bacterial genus and endotoxin levels partially explained the associations between moisture damage and symptom score.

Data on maternity staff views on the provision and implementation of PPIUD services are limited. The objective of this qualitative evaluation was to explore the views and experiences of obstetricians and midwives providing PPIUD within a UK maternity setting, in order to identify areas for improvement and inform service provision in other areas. METHODS Qualitative health services research within two public maternity hospitals in Lothian (Edinburgh and surrounding region), UK. Interviews with 30 maternity staff (obstetricians n=8; midwives n=22) involved in PPIUD provision. Data were analysed thematically. RESULTS Maternity staff were positive about the benefits of PPIUD for women. Midwives reported initial concerns about PPIUD safety, and the impact on workload; these views shifted following training, and as PPIUD was embedded into practice. Having a large pool of PPIUD-trained staff was identified as an important factor in successful service implementation. Having PPIUD 'champions' was important to address staff concerns, encourage training uptake, and advocate for the service to ensure continued resourcing. CONCLUSIONS PPIUD in maternity services can help address unmet need for effective contraception in the immediate postpartum period. We emphasise the importance of widespread engagement around PPIUD among all healthcare professionals involved in the care of women, to ensure staff are informed and supported. Clinical champions and leaders play a key role in amplifying the benefits of PPIUD, and advancing organisational learning.","Boydell, Nicola; Cooper, Michelle; Cameron, Sharon T; Glasier, Anna; Coutts, Shiona; McGuire, Frances; Harden, Jeni",BMJ sexual & reproductive health,97,27

Particular focus is given to the Chikungunya vaccine candidate as the first measles-vectored vaccine that demonstrated safety, immunogenicity, and functionality of the technology in humans even in the presence of pre-existing anti-measles immunity and thus achieved proof of concept for the technology. Expert commentary: Demonstrating no impact of pre-existing anti-measles immunity in humans on the response to the transgene was fundamental for the technology and indicates that the technology is suitable for large-scale immunization in measles pre-immune populations. The proof of concept in humans combined with a large preclinical track record of safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy for a variety of pathogens suggest the measles vector platform as promising plug-and-play vaccine platform technology for rapid development of effective preventive vaccines against viral and other infectious diseases.","Gerke, Christiane; Frantz, Phanramphoei N; Ramsauer, Katrin; Tangy, Frédéric",Expert review of vaccines,97,24
86162,86162,86162,Hepatitis E virus inhibits type I interferon induction by ORF1 products.,9.896483,7.578735,2014,"Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is present in all soils, providing a readily available carbon source for microorganisms, which influences microbially mediated biogeochemical processes. Rainfall-induced wetting can alter the content and composition of soil DOM. However, conventional methods commonly used to extract DOM from soils involve air- or oven-drying followed by extraction with water, and the results vary considerably in terms of indexes used. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the variation in DOM content and composition of soil gravity water and capillary water during wetting, and establish a better method to obtain real soil DOM information. Following simulated rainfall (50 mm h-1, 0-24 h), gravity water and capillary water in fresh soil samples were separated using a high-speed refrigerated centrifuge. Additionally, DOM in dried soil samples was extracted using various soil/water ratios after drying by different methods. The DOM data obtained by conventional methods were compared with capillary water data. The results showed that DOM degradation occurred mainly in capillary water close to the surface of soil particles. Among the six fluorescent components of DOM identified, a tryptophan-like component (Ex/Em = 295/335 nm and 230/335 nm) was possibly derived from terrestrial plants, and a tyrosine-like component (Ex/Em = 265/305 nm) was likely derived from microbial secretion. Except for little variation in the fluorescence index, dissolved organic carbon concentrations in capillary water were double those in dried soil extracted by conventional methods. The humification index and spectral slope ratio of DOM extracted by conventional methods also markedly varied, and no clear patterns were observed for the variation in specific UV absorbance at 254 nm. These findings allow real information to be obtained regarding soil DOM during wetting, and better selection of the extraction method and indexes when studying soil DOM.","Ge, Zhengkui; Gao, Li; Ma, Ning; Hu, En; Li, Ming",The Science of the total environment,97,28

We discuss the implications for ongoing vaccine research, and how placebo controls might be justified nevertheless. However, the ethical conflict remains highly problematic. We suggest that such ethical dilemmas should be avoided in the future by the introduction of a new system of global governance.

Open repair of chronic thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic dissection using deep hypothermia has been our preferred method to treat this complex pathology. The advantages of this technique include organ and spinal cord protection, the flexibility to extend the repair proximally into the arch, and the ability to limit ischemia to all vascular beds. METHODS Open repair of arch by left thoracotomy and descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic pathology using deep hypothermia was performed in 664 patients from 1995 to 2015. A subset of this cohort had chronic thoracoabdominal aortic dissection (n = 196). All nonemergency cases received coronary angiography and echocardiography preoperatively. Significant coronary artery disease or severe aortic insufficiency was addressed before repair of the chronic dissection. In recent years, lumbar drains were placed preoperatively in the most extensive repairs (extents II and III). Important intercostal arteries from T8 to L1 were revascularized with smaller-diameter looped grafts. Multibranched grafts for the visceral segment have been preferred in recent years. RESULTS Mean age of patients was 58 ± 14 years. Men comprised 74% of the cohort. Aortopathy was confirmed in 18% of the cohort. Prior thoracic aortic repair occurred in 57% of patients, and prior abdominal aortic repair occurred in 14% of patients. Prior type A aortic dissection occurred in 44% of patients, and prior type B occurred in 56% of patients. Operative mortality was 3.6%, permanent spinal cord ischemia occurred in 2.6% of patients, permanent hemodialysis occurred in 0% of patients, and permanent stroke occurred in 1% of patients. Reexploration for bleeding was 5.1%, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy occurred in 2.6%. Postoperative length of stay was 11.9 ± 9.7 days. Reintervention for pseudoaneurysm or growth of a distal aneurysm was 6.9%. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year survivals were 93%, 79%, and 57%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Open repair of chronic thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic dissection using deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest has low morbidity and mortality. The need for reintervention is low, and long-term survival is excellent. We believe that open repair continues to be the gold standard in patients who are suitable candidates for surgery.","Corvera, Joel; Copeland, Hannah; Blitzer, David; Hicks, Adam; Manghelli, Joshua; Hess, Philip; Fehrenbacher, John",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,97,1

Its causes have not been investigated yet. OBJECTIVE We hypothesized that pulmonary capillary leakage affects the severity of respiratory failure, causing a shift of fluids and proteins through the epithelial-endothelial barrier. METHODS One hundred seventy-four COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms, 92 admitted to the intermediate medicine ward (IMW) and 82 to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan, were studied. RESULTS Baseline characteristics at admission were considered. Proteins, interleukin 8 (IL-8) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analysed in 26 ICU patients. In addition, ten autopsy ultrastructural lung studies were performed in patients with COVID-19 and compared with postmortem findings in a control group (bacterial pneumonia-ARDS and H1N1-ARDS). ICU patients had lower serum albumin than IMW patients [20 (18-23) vs 28 (24-33) g L-1 , P < 0.001]. Serum albumin was lower in more compromised groups (lower PaO2 -to-FiO2 ratio and worst chest X-ray findings) and was associated with 30 days of probability of survival. Protein concentration was correlated with IL-8 and IL-10 levels in BALF. Electron microscopy examinations of eight out of ten COVID-19 lung tissues showed loosening of junctional complexes, quantitatively more pronounced than in controls, and direct viral infection of type 2 pneumocytes and endothelial cells. CONCLUSION Hypoalbuminaemia may serve as severity marker of epithelial-endothelial damage in patients with COVID-19. There are clues that pulmonary capillary leak syndrome plays a key role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and might be a potential therapeutic target.","Wu, M A; Fossali, T; Pandolfi, L; Carsana, L; Ottolina, D; Frangipane, V; Rech, R; Tosoni, A; Lopez, G; Agarossi, A; Cogliati, C; Meloni, F; Marchini, B; Nebuloni, M; Catena, E; Colombo, R",Journal of internal medicine,97,1

The aim of this study was to assess whether clinical evaluation of malnutrition based on these parameters is sufficient to predict complications after colorectal cancer surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS The American College of Surgeons-National Quality Improvement Program database was queried from 2005 to 2018. Patients undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery were divided into 4 groups: (1) albumin <3.1 g/dL within 21 days of surgery, (2) European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) 2 clinical parameters for malnutrition (≥10% loss of weight/6 months plus [BMI <20 kg/m2 if age <70 years OR BMI <22 kg/m2 if age ≥70 years]), (3) both aforementioned criteria, and (4) none of aforementioned criteria. RESULTS Of 82,280 patients, 5,932 (7.2%) had hypoalbuminemia <3.1 g/dL, 764 (0.9%) fulfilled clinical ESPEN 2 parameters, and 338 (0.4%) met both criteria. After adjusting for baseline confounders, patients in the hypoalbuminemia group had a higher risk of overall complications (odds ratio [OR] 1.92, p < 0.05 vs. OR 1.18 in the ESPEN 2 group, p < 0.05), major complications (OR 1.98, p < 0.05 vs. OR 1.20, p < 0.05), surgical complications (OR 1.77, 95% p < 0.05 vs. OR 1.1, p > 0.05), medical complications (OR 1.73, p < 0.05 vs. OR 1.16, p > 0.05), surgical site infection (OR 1.32, p < 0.05 vs. OR 0.86, p > 0.05), and prolonged hospitalization (OR 1.79, p < 0.05 vs. OR 1.22, p < 0.05). Patients who met both criteria were at highest risk. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative measurement of serum albumin appears to be essential to identify patients at risk for complications after colorectal cancer surgery.

Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which are abundant in human milk, are a diverse group of heterogeneous carbohydrates with wide ranging protective effects. In addition to promoting the colonization of beneficial intestinal flora, HMOs serve as decoy receptors, effectively blocking the attachment of pathogenic bacteria. HMOs also function as bacteriostatic agents, inhibiting the growth of gram-positive bacteria. Based on this precedence, an emerging area in the field has focused on characterizing the antiviral properties of HMOs. Indeed, HMOs have been evaluated as antiviral agents, with many possessing activity against life-threatening infections. This targeted review provides insight into the known glycan-binding interactions between select HMOs and influenza, rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and norovirus. Additionally, we review the role of HMOs in preventing necrotizing enterocolitis, an intestinal disease linked to viral infections.

There are two techniques for SVG harvesting: open and endoscopic. Our aim is to evaluate clinical results of endoscopic versus open SVG harvesting. Nowadays, endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) has become prevalent because of reduced complications with more patient satisfaction. OBJECTIVE We designed and performed a prospective randomized cohort study of patients undergoing CABG to compare the results of open versus endoscopic harvesting technique. METHODS Patients who underwent elective CABG at our hospitals were divided into two groups, during the period of January 2019 to March 2021. The EVH group (50 patients) underwent endoscopic technique compared with the open vein harvesting (OVH) group (50 patients) that was underwent open surgical incision for great saphenous vein (GSV) harvesting. The two groups demographically were similar and received identical management. Leg wound was evaluated at discharge, two weeks, and four weeks for evidence of any complications. Early outcomes were recorded, including infection, gaped wound and surgical re-suture, degree of pain, level of cosmetic satisfaction, and early mobilization. RESULTS In the EVH group, harvesting time increased, and incision closure time decreased in comparison with OVH. The hospital stay was 5.5 ± 2.4 days in the EVH group versus 9.5 ± 2.7 days in the OVH group. Leg wound complications were significantly reduced in the EVH group in comparison with the OVH group. CONCLUSIONS Endoscopic vein harvesting technique reduced leg wound complications. Conveniently, patients also were cosmetically satisfied.","Mubarak, Yasser; Abdeljawad, Ahmed",The heart surgery forum,97,1

This study aims to further characterize the anticonvulsant profile of these drugs. METHODS HEPP and Cl-HEPP were evaluated in various standardized acute seizure and toxic tests in female Swiss-OF1 mice. RESULTS Toxicities of HEPP and Cl-HEPP were limited; doses up to 30 mg/kg did not result in hypothermia, reduced spontaneous locomotor activity, or failure of the rotarod test, with doses >15 mg/kg potentiating pentobarbital-induced sleep. In maximal electroshock-induced seizures, 20 mg/kg Cl-HEPP protected 100 % of mice; lower doses shortened post-ictal recovery. Seizure protection occurred against subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole and picrotoxin, being limited against N-methyl-d-aspartate. In bicuculline test, clonic or fatal tonic seizures were decreased, onset delayed, and recovery improved; ED50 values (dose protecting 50 % of the animals) were 37.5 and 25 mg/kg for HEPP and Cl-HEPP, respectively. In magnesium deficiency-dependent audiogenic seizures (MDDAS), ED50 values were 3 and 8 mg/kg for Cl-HEPP and HEPP, respectively. The components of MDDAS (latency, wild running, seizure, and recovery phases) in unprotected animals were only minimally affected by near ED50 doses of Cl-HEPP and HEPP. DISCUSSION HEPP and, to a greater extent, Cl-HEPP provide anti-seizure protections in several acute seizure tests in mice at nontoxic doses. These results are consistent with the action of these drugs on diverse molecular targets directly resulting from their MGBR antagonistic properties. However, other mechanisms might occur possibly for the protection given in the MES test. Finally, a similarity in the modulation of MDDAS components between the two phenyl alcohol amides and ethosuximide could also be based on the MGBR antagonistic properties of the former, given the recently re-evaluated therapeutic relevant targets of the latter.","Pagès, Nicole; Maurois, Pierre; Bac, Pierre; Meza-Toledo, Sergio; Peralta-Cruz, Javier; Chamorro-Cevallos, Germán; Cristóbal-Luna, José Melesio; Vamecq, Joseph",Epilepsy research,97,1

METHODS We analyzed consecutive patients enrolled within 2 hours of symptom onset in a prehospital stroke trial, before and after regional Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services implementation of preferentially routing patients with acute stroke to approved stroke centers (ASCs). From January 2005 to mid-November 2009, patients were transported to the nearest emergency department, whereas from mid-November 2009 to December 2012, patients were preferentially transported to first 9, and eventually 29, ASCs. RESULTS There were 863 subjects enrolled before and 764 after emergency medical service preferential routing, with implementation leading to an increase in the proportion cared for at an ASC from 10% to 91% (P<0.0001), with a slight decrease in paramedic on-scene to emergency department arrival time (34.5 [SD, 9.1] minutes versus 33.5 [SD, 10.3] minutes; P=0.045). The effects of routing were immediate and included an increase in proportion of receiving ASC care (from 17% to 88%; P<0.001) and a greater number of enrollments (18.6% increase) when comparing 12 months before and after regional stroke system implementation. CONCLUSIONS The establishment of a regionalized emergency medical services system of acute stroke care dramatically increased the proportion of patients with acute stroke cared for at ASCs, from 1 in 10 to >9 in 10, with no clinically significant increase in prehospital care times and enhanced recruitment of patients into a prehospital treatment trial.

Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are major constituents of the lymphatic endothelium. These specialized cells could play important roles in initiation of host innate immune responses through sensing of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including toll-like receptors (TLRs). LECs secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to create local inflammatory conditions for recruitment of naïve antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs) to sites of infection and/or vaccine administration. In this study, we examined the innate immune potential of primary LEC populations derived from multiple tissues of an animal model for human infectious diseases - the ferret. We generated a total of six primary LEC populations from lung, tracheal, and mesenteric LN tissues from three different ferrets. Standard RT-PCR characterization of these primary LECs showed that they varied in their expression of LEC markers. The ferret LECs were examined for their ability to respond to poly I:C (TLR3 and RIG-I ligand) and other known TLR ligands as measured by production of proinflammatory cytokine (IFNα, IL6, IL10, Mx1, and TNFα) and chemokine (CCL5, CCL20, and CXCL10) mRNAs using real time RT-PCR. Poly I:C exposure induced robust proinflammatory responses by all of the primary ferret LECs. Chemotaxis was performed to determine the functional activity of CCL20 produced by the primary lung LECs and showed that the LEC-derived CCL20 was abundant and functional. Taken together, our results continue to reveal the innate immune potential of primary LECs during pathogen-host interactions and expand our understanding of the roles LECs might play in health and disease in animal models.","Berendam, Stella J; Fallert Junecko, Beth A; Murphey-Corb, Michael A; Fuller, Deborah H; Reinhart, Todd A",Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,97,20

In this experimental study, small intestinal submucosa (SIS) was tested as a sealing for stapled colonic anastomosis in a porcine model. The aims of this study were to determine the macroscopic and microscopic outcomes and to evaluate the safety and feasibility of applying SIS for anastomotic sealing. MATERIALS AND METHODS Circular stapled anastomoses were performed in 18 pigs. Standard anastomosis in the control group (n = 8) was compared to an SIS-sealed anastomosis in the study group (n = 10). After 30 days, anastomotic segments were examined for macroscopic and microscopic regeneration and their resistance to mechanical stress. Furthermore, animal survival and clinical course were evaluated. RESULTS None of the animals developed anastomotic leakage, intraabdominal abscess, or peritonitis. Shrinkage of SIS was evident in nine of ten animals. Encapsulation and displacement of the SIS patches were seen in two animals. Quantity of anastomotic granulation tissue and rate of complete mucosal coverage of anastomotic line were increased in SIS-sealed anastomoses without reaching significance. Moreover, no significant differences were found in the rate of survival of the animals, anastomotic stricture formation, intraabdominal adhesions, anastomotic bursting pressure, and microscopic healing parameters of the anastomosis between stapled colonic standard anastomosis and anastomosis protected by SIS. CONCLUSION The results of this study indicate a safe use of SIS for anastomotic reinforcement in a porcine model. Adverse effects like strictures, increased adhesions, and anastomotic abscesses were absent. Promoting effects on colonic wound healing by SIS were microscopically evident. The results argue for a careful clinical evaluation in humans.","Hoeppner, Jens; Crnogorac, Vladan; Marjanovic, Goran; Jüttner, Eva; Keck, Tobias; Weiser, Hans-Fred; Hopt, Ullrich Theodor",International journal of colorectal disease,97,17

However, there is a lack of consistent evidence about chronic low back pain (CLBP) prognosis, especially highlighting predictors that influence CLBP outcome. Existing systematic reviews are scarce, outdated and incomplete. The primary aim of this systematic review is to identify multivariable models and/or predictors associated with clinical outcomes in subjects with CLBP (namely pain intensity, disability, return to work, psychological well-being and quality of life). METHODS We will systematically search Ovid MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus and Web of Science databases for longitudinal studies, published until June 2017, including adults with CLBP (defined as persistent pain with ≥ 3 months duration), which studied the association between multivariable models and/or predictors with at least one of the selected clinical outcomes after ≥ 3 months of follow-up. Articles' screening and selection will be conducted by two reviewers, blindly and independently. Disagreements will be resolved by a third reviewer. Models' discriminative ability will be assessed using C-statistic. The link between multivariable models and predictors with the clinical outcome will be analysed through association measures. Qualitative and quantitative synthesis of the available evidence will be performed. Meta-analysis will be conducted to aggregate each type of measure. In the absence or in the presence of only slight to moderate of heterogeneity, we will use the fixed or random effects model, respectively. In case of moderate to severe heterogeneity, an attempt to explain variability in detail will be made through subgroups and sensitivity analyses. Subgroup analysis will be conducted according to clinical outcome, follow-up duration (≤ 6 months versus > 6 months) and type of context (pain management clinics versus other therapeutic settings). DISCUSSION We consider that it is urgent to highlight the available evidence about CLBP prognosis.

To investigate whether reinforced staplers reduce the incidence of clinically relevant pancreatic fistula (PF) after DP compared with staplers without reinforcement. METHODS Between July 2016 and December 2017, patients scheduled for DP were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) at nine hospitals in Hiroshima Japan. Patients were randomized either to reinforced stapler or bare stapler. The primary endpoint was incidence of clinically relevant PF. This RCT was registered with UMIN Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN000022341). RESULTS A total of 122 patients were assigned to reinforced stapler (n = 61) or bare stapler (n = 61), and 119 patients (61 reinforced stapler and 59 bare stapler) were analyzed. There was no significant difference in the incidence of clinically relevant PF between the reinforced stapler and bare stapler groups (16.3% vs. 27.1%, p = 0.15). Furthermore, the rates of major complication (16.3% vs. 18.6%, p = 0.74), postpancreatectomy hemorrhage (0% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.08), and median postoperative in-hospital days (19 days vs. 20 days, p = 0.78) did not differ between the two groups. Within a subset of 82 patients in whom the thickness of pancreatic transection line was less than 14 mm, a significant difference was found in the incidence of clinically relevant PF (4.5% vs. 21.0% in the reinforced stapler vs. bare stapler groups, respectively, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Reinforced stapler for pancreatic transection during DP does not reduce the incidence of clinically relevant PF compared to stapler without reinforcement.","Kondo, Naru; Uemura, Kenichiro; Nakagawa, Naoya; Okada, Kenjiro; Kuroda, Shintaro; Sudo, Takeshi; Hadano, Naoto; Matstukawa, Hiroyoshi; Satoh, Daisuke; Sasaki, Masaru; Abe, Tomoyuki; Fukuda, Saburo; Oshita, Akihiko; Nakashima, Akira; Hashimoto, Yasushi; Ohdan, Hideki; Murakami, Yoshiaki",Annals of surgical oncology,97,31

The diagnosis of COVID-19 is frequently based on a positive serological test. We noted the occurrence of false-positive results for COVID-19 in the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip (ICS) assay in sera from patients with autoimmune diseases (ADs). This study aimed to evaluate the possible reasons for the false-positive results in two ICS assays (Wondfo ICS and Innovita ICS) and to investigate the effect of urea dissociation in reducing false-positive results. Methods The sera of 135 patients with ADs, 13 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 95 disease controls, and 120 healthy controls were tested for immunoglobin M (IgM) and IgG against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using Wondfo and Innovita ICS kits. The distributions of auto-antibodies in antibody-positive and antibody-negative groups were also compared, and bivariable logistic regression was used to assess auto-antibodies associated with false-positive results. A urea dissociation test of ICS was performed for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive samples. Results Specificity of Wondfo ICS for the 95 disease controls was 94.74% compared to 98.95% and 96.84% for Innovita SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively. Specificity of Wondfo ICS for the 120 healthy controls was 97.5% compared to 100% and 99.17% for Innovita SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively. Specificity of Wondfo ICS for AD patients was 73.33% compared to 97.78% and 96.30% for Innovita SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively. Sensitivity was 74.07% for Wondfo compared to 70.37% for Innovita IgM and 66.67% for Innovita IgG. Using the Wondfo ICS, the percentage of elevated rheumatoid factor (RF) level (>20 IU/mL) was higher in the SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive group compared with the antibody-negative group [27/36 (75.0%) vs. 34/99 (34.34%), P=0.001]. The elevated RF was associated with antibody positivity, with an odds ratio of 4.671 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.88-11.69]. The specificity of the Wondfo ICS assay for the AD patients was increased from 73.33% to 94.07% after the urea dissociation assay. Conclusions An elevated serum RF level could lead to false-positive results when detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Wondfo ICS kit, and the urea dissociation assay would be helpful in reducing the incidence of false-positive results.","Xiao, Xiumei; Zhou, Qingtao; Zhu, Jinghao; Sun, Lin; Zhang, Hua; Sun, Yongchang; Zhao, Jinxia; Cui, Liyan",Annals of translational medicine,97,1

Combined endoscopic-laparoscopic surgery, using both laparoscopy and CO2 colonoscopy, has been introduced as a new approach for these complex colon polyps with intent to avoid bowel resection. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the safety and outcomes of combined endoscopic-laparoscopic surgery used for treatment of complex right colon polyps. DESIGN This is a retrospective study of patients undergoing combined endoscopic-laparoscopic surgery for treatment of benign right colon polyps from 2003 to 2008. SETTINGS This is a single-institution study. PATIENTS Twenty-three patients with complex right colon polyps were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main outcome measures included the length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, and polyp recurrence. RESULTS Of 23 patients, 20 (87%) patients had their polyp removed successfully by combined endoscopic-laparoscopic surgery and 3 (13%) needed laparoscopic resection, after laparoendoscopic evaluation. The median length of hospital stay was 2 days (range, 1-5), and there were no postoperative complications. Median follow-up time was 12 months. Three patients had recurrent polyps, and the recurrence-free interval at 36 months was 55.7% (95% CI = 8.6%, 87.0%). All recurrences were benign polyps and were removed by colonoscopic snaring. CONCLUSIONS Combined endoscopic-laparoscopic surgery can be safely offered to selected patients with benign right colon polyps that can not be removed by colonoscopy. This combined approach may provide a viable alternative to right colon resection for complex benign colon lesions and warrants future investigation.","Yan, Jun; Trencheva, Koiana; Lee, Sang W; Sonoda, Toyooki; Shukla, Parul; Milsom, Jeffrey W",Diseases of the colon and rectum,97,17

An integrative review of the literature published 2009-2018 on CG associated with caregiving was performed using PubMed, PsychINFO, and Web of Science. The search returned 1428 articles, of which 32 were included in the review. Sixteen studies described risk and protective factors and 16 described interventions for CG. Caregiver-related risk factors included fewer years of education, depression, anxiety, poor physical health, and maladaptive dependency and attachment traits. Additional risk factors included lower perceived social support, family conflict at end-of-life, and family having difficulty accepting death. Care recipient-related risk factors are younger age, fear of death, and place of death. Protective factors included hospice utilization in reducing fear of death, high pre-bereavement spiritualty, and satisfaction with palliative care. Complicated grief treatment was the most widely-studied intervention. Social Workers and other clinicians can use this information to identify family caregivers at increased risk for CG and refer or implement an early intervention to lessen its impact.","Mason, Tina M; Tofthagen, Cindy S; Buck, Harleah G",Journal of social work in end-of-life & palliative care,97,16

We used a longitudinal design (N = 1615, 26% with mental disorder history). Successive samplings were performed from three days before quarantine start and across quarantine phases of up to 103-days duration. Follow-up was one month later. Sex (woman) and age (younger) were significant predictors of worse mental health only in college students without mental disorder background. Having any suicidal behavior background significantly predicted worse mental health in college students both with and without mental disorder history. Loneliness and region of residence were not statistically significant. In the between-groups comparisons, college students having mental disorder background had worse mental health than those without such a background. However, in the within-subject comparisons, no statistically significant changes occurred across time in the mental health of college students having mental disorder history. Conversely, significant changes occurred in those without such a background, but only when the interaction between time and quarantine duration was considered. Worsening mental health occurred during the most heavily restrictive quarantine phases, while some of the remissions occurred during the longest, but less restrictive ones.","Steinmetz, Lorena Cecilia López; Fong, Shao Bing; Godoy, Juan Carlos",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,97,19

This study is a functional comparison of novel, screw-type absorbable and permanent fixation devices with a traditional titanium fixation device. METHODS Fifteen pigs each underwent the laparoscopic placement of two 11 × 14-cm mesh prostheses and were randomized for mesh fixation with either titanium spiral tacks (TS), absorbable screw-type fasteners (SF), or permanent screw-type fasteners (PF) (n = 10 mesh prostheses for each fixation group). Adhesions were assessed laparoscopically at 4 weeks. The fixation devices were also embedded in porcine abdominal rectus muscle for ex vivo mechanical testing along with partial thickness polypropylene suture (PR) as a control group (n = 40 for each group). Maximum pull-off forces were measured. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and a P-value < 0.05 was considered to be significant. RESULTS The mean tenacity adhesion scores were 1.40 ± 0.52 (PF), 1.7 ± 0.82 (SF), and 2.6 ± 1.07 (TS). Adhesions in the PF group were significantly less tenacious compared with the TS group (P = 0.01). Quantitative adhesion scores were not significantly different among groups. The maximum pull-off forces, measured in Newtons, were 28.61 N ± 4.89 N (TS), 22.71 N ± 7.86 N (SF), 16.98 N ± 7.59 N (PF), and 20.83 N ± 6.25 N (PR). The pull-off force in the TS group was higher than all of the other groups (P < 0.001). The SF group also had a higher pull-off force compared with the PF group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The screw-type absorbable and permanent fixation devices provided adequate fixation and were associated with decreased adhesions in this porcine model.","Byrd, J F; Agee, N; Swan, R Z; Lau, K N; Heath, J J; Mckillop, I H; Sindram, D; Martinie, J B; Iannitti, D A",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,97,1

This is especially true for subpopulations like young men who have sex with men and young transgender women (YMSM-YTW) who report higher rates of substance use. This study examines changes in prevalence and frequency of marijuana and non-marijuana drug use among YMSM-YTW following the onset of the pandemic. METHOD Data for this analysis (n = 458 participants, 1356 observations) come from an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of YMSM-YTW. A series of Bayesian multilevel models were used to examine change in prevalence and frequency of use for marijuana and non-marijuana drugs. RESULTS Results indicated no systematic change in prevalence or frequency of marijuana use. However, a decrease in non-marijuana drug use was observed (OR = 0.60, 95 % CrI: [0.37, 0.94]) following the onset of the pandemic. Furthermore, a small increase in the frequency of non-marijuana drug use was observed (OR = 1.79, 95 % CrI: [1.02, 3.21]) among individuals who used these substances. CONCLUSIONS These findings concur with a small number of studies identifying a decrease in drug use prevalence but increase in frequency among those who continue to use drugs. Despite the protective effect of lower drug use prevalence, higher frequency of use may lead to additional negative health outcomes of drug use, particularly among groups facing multiple health challenges such as YMSM-YTW. However, the pandemic likely has a unique impact on substance use behaviors across subpopulations.","Janulis, Patrick; Newcomb, Michael E; Mustanski, Brian",Drug and alcohol dependence,97,1

However, interpretation of in vivo signals is often limited to plaque identification. We evaluated binding of some promising radioligands in an in vitro approach in atherosclerotic plaques with different phenotypes. METHODS Tissue sections of carotid endarterectomy tissue were characterized as early plaque, fibro-calcific plaque, or phenotypically vulnerable plaque. In vitro binding assays for the radioligands [111In]In-DOTATATE; [111In]In-DOTA-JR11; [67Ga]Ga-Pentixafor; [111In]In-DANBIRT; and [111In]In-EC0800 were conducted, the expression of the radioligand targets was assessed via immunohistochemistry. Radioligand binding and expression of radioligand targets was investigated and compared. RESULTS In sections characterized as vulnerable plaque, binding was highest for [111In]In-EC0800; followed by [111In]In-DANBIRT; [67Ga]Ga-Pentixafor; [111In]In-DOTA-JR11; and [111In]In-DOTATATE (0.064 ± 0.036; 0.052 ± 0.029; 0.011 ± 0.003; 0.0066 ± 0.0021; 0.00064 ± 0.00014 %Added activity/mm2, respectively). Binding of [111In]In-DANBIRT and [111In]In-EC0800 was highest across plaque phenotypes, binding of [111In]In-DOTA-JR11 and [67Ga]Ga-Pentixafor differed most between plaque phenotypes. Binding of [111In]In-DOTATATE was the lowest across plaque phenotypes. The areas positive for cells expressing the radioligand's target differed between plaque phenotypes for all targets, with lowest percentage area of expression in early plaque sections and highest in phenotypically vulnerable plaque sections. CONCLUSIONS Radioligands targeting inflammatory cell markers showed different levels of binding in atherosclerotic plaques and among plaque phenotypes. Different radioligands might be used for plaque detection and discerning early from vulnerable plaque. [111In]In-EC0800 and [111In]In-DANBIRT appear most suitable for plaque detection, while [67Ga]Ga-Pentixafor and [111In]In-DOTA-JR11 might be best suited for differentiation between plaque phenotypes.","Meester, Eric J; de Blois, Erik; Krenning, Boudewijn J; van der Steen, Antonius F W; Norenberg, Jeff P; van Gaalen, Kim; Bernsen, Monique R; de Jong, Marion; van der Heiden, Kim",EJNMMI research,97,1

However, few of them are offered timely palliative care. One main barrier is the difficulty in identifying those who require palliative care. Several palliative care needs-assessment/measurement tools were used to help identify these patients and assess/measure their needs, but it is not known which one is the most appropriate for this population. This review aimed to identify the most appropriate palliative care needs-assessment/measurement tools for patients with heart failure. Cochrane Library, MEDLINE Complete, AMED, PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete, EMBASE, EThOS, websites of the identified tools, and references and citations of the included studies were searched from inception to 25 June 2020.

Twenty-seven papers were included regarding nineteen studies, most of which were quantitative and observational. Six tools were identified and compared according to their content and context of use, development, psychometrics, and clinical applications in identifying patients with palliative care needs. Despite limited evidence, the Needs Assessment Tool: Progressive Disease - Heart Failure (NAT:PD-HF) is the most appropriate palliative care needs-assessment tool for use in heart failure populations. It covers most of the patient needs and has the best psychometric properties and evidence of identification ability and appropriateness.

Laboratory automation and the linkage of information systems for big(ger) data management, including artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, also are being introduced. The initial optimism associated with these developments has now entered a more reality-driven phase of reflection on the significant challenges, complexities, and health care benefits posed by these innovations. With this in mind, the ongoing process of clinical laboratory consolidation, covering large geographical regions, represents an opportunity for the efficient and cost-effective introduction of new laboratory technologies and improvements in translational research and development. This will further define and generate the mandatory infrastructure used in validation and implementation of newer high-throughput diagnostic approaches. Effective, structured access to large numbers of well-documented biobanked biological materials from networked laboratories will release countless opportunities for clinical and scientific infectious disease research and will generate positive health care impacts. We describe why consolidation of clinical microbiology laboratories will generate quality benefits for many, if not most, aspects of the services separate institutions already provided individually. We also define the important role of innovative and large-scale diagnostic platforms. Such platforms lend themselves particularly well to computational (AI)-driven genomics and bioinformatics applications. These and other diagnostic innovations will allow for better infectious disease detection, surveillance, and prevention with novel translational research and optimized (diagnostic) product and service development opportunities as key results.","Vandenberg, Olivier; Durand, Géraldine; Hallin, Marie; Diefenbach, Andreas; Gant, Vanya; Murray, Patrick; Kozlakidis, Zisis; van Belkum, Alex",Clinical microbiology reviews,97,31

We aim to demonstrate a novel technique of pure transvaginal laparoscopic ventral hernia repair in a series of patients performed in our institution. TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION The patient was placed in lithotomy position and steep Trendelenburg. A 2-cm transverse colpotomy incision was made and a SILS port was introduced. One 12-mm trocar and two 5-mm trocars were placed through the SILS port and standard straight laparoscopic instruments were used. An appropriately sized round mesh was deployed within a specimen retrieval bag into the peritoneal cavity. Complete anterior circumferential fixation of the mesh was achieved using an AbsorbaTack device. The colpotomy incision was closed. RESULTS There were a total of 6 pure transvaginal ventral hernia repair procedures performed in our institution between November 2010 and February 2012. The first case was converted to an open procedure after a rectal injury was recognized and repaired. Two patients had transient urinary retention that resolved after 24 hours. One patient had vaginal wound granulation noted at 2 months postoperatively. No long-term complications or recurrences were noted with a median follow-up of 9 months. The mean operative time was 107 minutes.

One of 29 (3.4%) patients had evidence of postoperative hemoabdomen, which was successfully treated with a single packed RBC transfusion. Expansion of the SLL diameter from 8 to 15 cm was accomplished to allow for resection of larger masses. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Use of an SLL for partial or complete liver lobectomy in a variety of companion animal species was a safe technique and was associated with low morbidity and mortality rates. Expansion of the ligature loop diameter and use of multiple SLLs may be necessary for larger lobectomies.","Goodman, Andrew R; Casale, Sue A",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,97,1

We evaluated tissue yields with a 22G fine-needle biopsy (FNB) versus 19G FNA fine-needle aspirate (FNA) device. Patients and methods Biopsies were obtained from 20 patients using the 19G FNA and 22G FNB randomizing each in a cross-over fashion with a blinded outcome assessor. Tissue adequacy for histologic evaluation was the primary outcome, or the proportion of specimens obtaining pathologic diagnosis (portal structures ≥ 5 or length of the longest piece ≥ 15 mm). Additional secondary outcomes included portal and centrilobular inflammation/fibrosis, length of the longest piece, aggregate specimen length, and small (< 5 mm), medium (5 - 8 mm) and large (> 8 mm) fragments. Results were compared in a per needle basis. Patients with cirrhosis were excluded. Results Eighty biopsies (40 each 19G FNA and 22G FNB) were obtained. Tissue adequacy was greater for the 19G FNA (88 %) versus 22G FNB (68 %), ( P = 0.03). There was no difference in total portal structures for the 19G FNA (7.4) and 22G FNB (6.1), ( P = 0.28). There was no difference in pre-processing outcomes. After processing, length of the longest piece was higher for the 19G FNA (9.1 mm) versus 22G FNB (6.6 mm), ( P = 0.02). More total post-processing small fragments 29.9 versus 20.7, ( P = 0.01) and fewer large fragments 1.0 versus 0.4 for the 22G FNB ( P = 0.01) were detected. Conclusions Tissue adequacy was higher for the 19G FNA versus 22G FNB needle.

Samples from mumps virus-negative patients presenting unilateral or bilateral parotitis or other salivary gland swelling were tested for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) by real-time PCR and for respiratory viruses by two multiplex-PCR-based assays to detect parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1-4, influenza virus (InV) A, B and C, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enterovirus, coronavirus 229E, coronavirus OC43, and rhinovirus. 101 samples were analyzed in persons aged 8 months to 50 years. Oral samples were collected on the first day of glandular swelling in 53 patients (52.5%), and on the first two days in 74 patients (73.3%). Viruses were detected in 52 (51.5%) of samples: one virus (25 EBV, 8 PIV3, 4 adenovirus, 4 PIV2, 1 PIV1, 1 InVA, and 1 enterovirus) was detected in 44 patients (84.6%), two viruses in 7 patients, and three viruses in one patient. In 58 patients (57.5%) whose sample was collected in the first 2 days after onset of parotitis and had received two doses of MMR vaccine and in 15 patients (14.8%) whose sample was collected on the first day, it is very likely that the cause was not the mumps virus. This would mean that 72.3% (73/101) of the reported sporadic suspected mumps cases were not mumps cases. The timing of oral-sample collection is crucial to correctly interpret the negative results for mumps virus RNA, especially when suspected cases occur in vaccinated persons.","Barrabeig, Irene; Costa, Josep; Rovira, Ariadna; Marcos, M Angeles; Isanta, Ricard; López-Adalid, Rubén; Cervilla, Ana; Torner, Nuria; Domínguez, Angela",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,97,31

DESIGN Cluster randomised trial SETTING: Abortion, youth, and maternal health clinics in Stockholm, Sweden. POPULATION Sexually active women ≥18 years without a wish for pregnancy seeking abortion and/or contraceptive counselling. METHODS For participants in clinics randomised to intervention, trained health care providers implemented a study-specific intervention package designed for structured contraceptive counselling. Participants in the control clinics received routine counselling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome was choice of LARCs at first visit. Secondary outcomes were LARC initiation at three months and pregnancy rates at three and 12 months. We used logistic mixed-effects models with random intercept for clinic to account for clustering. RESULTS From September 2017 to May 2019, 28 randomised clinics enrolled 1364 participants. Analyses including 1338 subjects showed that more participants in the intervention compared to control group chose LARCs (267/658 (40.6%) versus 206/680 (30.3%), odds ratio (OR) 2.77, 95% CI 1.99 to 3.86). LARC initiation was higher in the intervention compared to the control group (213/528 (40.3%) versus 153/531 (28.8%), OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.49). At abortion clinics, pregnancy rate was significantly lower at 12 months in the intervention versus the control group (13/101 (12.9%) versus 28/103 (27.2%), OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.88). CONCLUSIONS Structured contraceptive counselling increased LARC uptake in all clinics and significantly reduced unintended pregnancy rates in abortion clinics at 12 months follow-up.","Emtell Iwarsson, Karin; Envall, Niklas; Bizjak, Isabella; Bring, Johan; Kopp Kallner, Helena; Gemzell Danielsson, Kristina",BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,97,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS Following percutaneous ablation of 35 liver tumors, two abdominal radiologists, blinded to outcomes, independently reviewed follow-up MRI examinations for tumoral enhancement suggestive of residual/recurrent tumor and rated their confidence level. After one year, the readers reviewed the same examinations with added subtraction images. Accuracy of the detection of residual/recurrent tumor and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR; for tumoral enhancement-to-liver, tumoral enhancement-to-ablation zone, and ablation zone-to-liver) were calculated with and without subtraction images and compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Interobserver variability was computed using Kappa (κ) statistics. RESULTS Residual/recurrent tumor was present in 8 (23.5%) of 34 tumors. Accuracy of detecting residual/recurrent tumor with subtraction images and interobserver agreement (κ = 0.72, good) were better than accuracy of detecting residual/recurrent tumor and interobserver agreement (κ = 0.57, moderate) of enhanced MR images without subtraction. Mean CNR of subtraction images was significantly higher than that of enhanced MR images for tumoral enhancement-to-liver (0.2 ± 5 versus 11.6 ± 14.4, P = 0.03), tumoral enhancement-to-ablation zone (10.1 ± 12.5 versus 34.4 ± 29.4, P = 0.02), and ablation zone-to-liver (11.8 ± 13.3 versus 102.5 ± 238.4, P = 0.03). CONCLUSION When using MRI, subtraction images help both detect and exclude residual/recurrent tumor following percutaneous liver ablations.","Tatli, Servet; Acar, Murat; Tuncali, Kemal; Sadow, Cheryl A; Morrison, Paul R; Silverman, Stuart G",Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,97,27

MATERIALS AND METHODS A literature review has been performed on the following topics: acute otitis media, adenoiditis, tonsillitis, rhinosinusitis, microbiotics and the role of bacterial interference, and bacteriotherapy in the prevention and treatment of URTI. RESULTS Research studies into the characteristics of the microbiological flora and its role in the pathogenesis of URTI have focused on a single pathogen, on resistance to and ineffectiveness of antibiotic therapies, or on the persistence of bacterial biofilm. Recent evidence supports a central role of the existing microbial ecosystem in the pathogenesis of respiratory disease. In light of this, new therapeutic approaches include the implantation and persistence within the normal microflora of relatively innocuous ""effector"" bacteria that can competitively exclude or prevent the outgrowth of potentially disease-causing bacteria. Recently, a retrospective and observational study demonstrated that S. salivarius 24SMB and S. oralis 89a nasal spray could be effective in the prevention of recurrent otitis media in a real-life setting. Other studies have focused on the role of bacteriotherapy in children with beneficial effects in the prevention of URTI. CONCLUSIONS The results of previous studies on the role of bacteriotherapy in paediatric URTI suggest that the use of bacterial interference phenomena through bacteriotherapy is a feasible, safe approach and deserves proper consideration as a promising therapeutic strategy against URTI.","Bellussi, L M; Passali, F M; Ralli, M; De Vincentiis, M; Greco, A; Passali, D",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,97,1

Seven endurance-trained cyclists (mean ± SD peak O2 uptake, 62.0 ± 5.6 mL/kg/min) completed two high-intensity constant-load cycling trials (296 ± 34 W) to the limit of tolerance in a hot (34 °C, 20% relative humidity) and, on a separate occasion, for the same duration, a control condition (18 °C, 20% relative humidity). Core body temperature (Tc ) was measured throughout. Before and immediately after each trial, twitch responses to supramaximal femoral nerve and transcranial magnetic stimulation were obtained from the knee extensors to assess neuromuscular and corticospinal function, respectively. Exercise time was 11.4 ± 2.6 min. Peak Tc was higher in the hot compared with control (38.36 ± 0.43 °C vs 37.86 ± 0.36 °C; P = 0.035). Post-exercise reductions in maximal voluntary contraction force (13 ± 9% vs 9 ± 5%), potentiated twitch force (16 ± 12% vs 21 ± 13%) and voluntary activation (9 ± 7% vs 7 ± 7%) were similar in hot and control trials, respectively. However, cortical voluntary activation declined more in the hot compared with the control (8 ± 3% vs 3 ± 2%; P = 0.001). Exercise-induced hyperthermia elicits significant central fatigue of which a large portion can be attributed to supraspinal fatigue. These data indicate that performance decrements in the heat might initially originate in the brain.","Goodall, S; Charlton, K; Hignett, C; Prichard, J; Barwood, M; Howatson, G; Thomas, K",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,97,1

Tobacco companies have actively promoted the substitution of cigarettes with purportedly safer tobacco products (e.g., smokeless tobacco, e-cigarettes) as tobacco harm reduction (THR). Given the tobacco, e-cigarette, and pharmaceutical industries' substantial financial interests, we quantified industry influence on support for THR. Objectives. To analyze a comprehensive set of articles published in peer-reviewed journals assessing funding sources and support for or opposition to substitution of tobacco or nicotine products as harm reduction. Search Methods. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO with a comprehensive search string including all articles, comments, and editorials published between January 1, 1992, and July 26, 2016. Selection Criteria. We included English-language publications published in peer-reviewed journals addressing THR in humans and excluded studies on modified cigarettes, on South Asian smokeless tobacco variants, on pregnant women, on animals, not mentioning a tobacco or nicotine product, on US Food and Drug Administration-approved nicotine replacement therapies, and on nicotine vaccines. Data Collection and Analysis. We double-coded all articles for article type; primary product type (e.g., snus, e-cigarettes); themes for and against THR; stance on THR; THR concepts; funding or affiliation with tobacco, e-cigarette, pharmaceutical industry, or multiple industries; and each author's country. We fit exact logistic regression models with stance on THR as the outcome (pro- vs anti-THR) and source of funding or industry affiliation as the predictor taking into account sparse data. Additional models included article type as the outcome (nonempirical or empirical) and industry funding or affiliation as predictor, and stratified analyses for empirical and nonempirical studies with stance on THR as outcome and funding source as predictor. Main Results. Searches retrieved 826 articles, including nonempirical articles (21%), letters or commentaries (34%), editorials (5%), cross-sectional studies (15%), systematic reviews and meta-analyses (3%), and randomized controlled trials (2%). Overall, 23.9% disclosed support by industry; 49% of articles endorsed THR, 42% opposed it, and 9% took neutral or mixed positions. Support from the e-cigarette industry (odds ratio [OR] = 20.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.3, 180.7), tobacco industry (OR = 59.4; 95% CI = 10.1, +infinity), or pharmaceutical industry (OR = 2.18; 95% CI = 1.3, 3.7) was significantly associated with supportive stance on THR in analyses accounting for sparse data. Authors' Conclusions. Non-industry-funded articles were evenly divided in stance, while industry-funded articles favored THR. Because of their quantity, letters and comments may influence perceptions of THR when empirical studies lack consensus. Public Health Implications. Public health practitioners and researchers need to account for industry funding when interpreting the evidence in THR debates.","Hendlin, Yogi H; Vora, Manali; Elias, Jesse; Ling, Pamela M",American journal of public health,97,16

Our purpose was to examine transpulmonary pressure (P TP) and end-expiratory lung volume (functional residual capacity (FRC)) during body positioning changes in an animal model under the influence of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or experimental pleural effusion (PLEF). METHODS Fourteen deeply anesthetized swine were studied including tracheostomy, thoracostomy, and esophageal catheter placement. Animals were ventilated at V T = 10 ml/kg, frequency of 15, I/E = 1:2, and FIO2 = 0.5. The animals were randomized to supine, prone, right lateral, left lateral, and semi-Fowler positions with a PEEP of 1 cm H2O (PEEP1) or a PEEP of 10 cm H2O (PEEP10) applied. Experimental PLEF was generated by 10 ml/kg saline instilled into either pleural space. P TP and FRC were determined in each condition. RESULTS No significant differences in FRC were found among the four horizontal positions. Compared to horizontal positioning, semi-Fowler's increased FRC (p < 0.001) by 56% at PEEP1 and 54% at PEEP10 without PLEF and by 131% at PEEP1 and 98% at PEEP10 with PLEF. Inspiratory or expiratory P TP showed insignificant differences across positions at both levels of PEEP. Consistently negative end-expiratory P TP at PEEP1 increased to positive values with PEEP10. CONCLUSIONS FRC did not differ among horizontal positions; however, semi-Fowler's positioning significantly raised FRC. P TP proved insensitive to mechanical asymmetry. While end-expiratory P TP was negative at PEEP1, applying PEEP10 caused a transition to positive P TP, suggestive of reopening of initially compressed lung units.","Cortes-Puentes, Gustavo A; Gard, Kenneth; Keenan, Joseph C; Adams, Alexander; Dries, David; Marini, John J",Intensive care medicine experimental,97,16

Previous studies have documented that stigma and limited knowledge about MAT are prevalent among CJ court personnel. We describe development and pilot testing of an eLearning intervention to improve MAT knowledge and increase MAT referrals in Ohio courts. Methods: Building upon a nationwide survey conducted in 2011 of drug courts and informed by MAT opinions from judges who supervised OUD clients, we developed two eLearning MAT modules. Judges completed a brief online MAT knowledge-attitude scale (K-A) before, after, and at 3 months. Judges were asked about MAT referrals pretest and 3 months later. Results: Sixty-three judges expressed interest in the study, 25 completed the pretest and viewed the modules, 11 completed a 3 month posttest. At pretest, K-A scores were significantly (p<.05) lower for agonist medications than for extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX; Vivitrol). K-A scores improved at posttest for agonist medications (p<.05) but declined to pretest levels three months later. Three months after the pretest, buprenorphine referrals increased from 2.6% to 9.7% (p<.05). There was no significant difference on K-A scores for agonist medication between the Ohio sample (at pretest) and the 2011 sample. Conclusion: Although there is some indication that eLearning may have strengthened knowledge gains and increased buprenorphine referrals, a more robust eLearning intervention will likely be required to increase court personnel participation and sustain eLearning knowledge gains. Recruiting and sustaining judges' participation in the study represented a significant study limitation.","Matusow, Harlan; Rosenblum, Andrew; Fong, Chunki",Substance use & misuse,97,1

DESIGN A systematic review. METHODS A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library) was performed to identify intervention trials published from journal inception to January 2020. Controlled trials, or quasi-experimental trials, which measured pre-intervention, post-intervention or during-intervention outcomes, where the participants were required to leave the care setting to participate in an intervention, were eligible for inclusion. Quality appraisal of the studies was performed following the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias or Newcastle-Ottawa Scale tools. RESULTS Of the 4155 articles screened, 11 articles met the inclusion criteria from 9 different studies. The number of participants in the studies ranged from 6 to 70 people living with dementia and lasted for 3 weeks up to 5 months. The interventions were aquatic exercise, wheelchair cycling, art gallery discussion groups, an intergenerational mentorship programme, horse riding, walking and outdoor gardening. Overall, the studies indicated preliminary evidence of psychological (n=7), physical (n=4) and physiological (n=1) benefits, and all interventions were feasible to conduct away from the aged care facilities. However, the low number of participants in the included studies (n=177), the absence of a control group in all but three studies, and potential for selection bias, limits the generalisability of the findings. CONCLUSIONS Activities outside of the residential aged care setting have the potential to be effective at providing a range of benefits for people living with dementia. Higher quality studies are required to encourage care providers to implement these type of activities in dementia care settings.

To evaluate the incidence of accidental parathyroidectomy in our series of total thyroidectomies, to investigate its clinical and biochemical consequences, and to identify potential risk factors. Methods. Patients who underwent total thyroidectomy between January 2006 and December 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Pathology reports were reviewed to identify those cases who had an incidental parathyroidectomy and these were compared to patients with no parathyroidectomy, in terms of clinical (age, sex, and symptoms of hypocalcemia), pathological (thyroid specimen weight, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and malignancy), and biochemical (serum calcium and phosphate levels) factors. Results. 281 patients underwent total thyroidectomy during the study period. Incidental parathyroidectomy was noticed in 24.9% of cases, with 44.3% of parathyroid glands found in an intrathyroidal location. Evidence of postoperative biochemical hypocalcemia was noticed in 28.6% of patients with parathyroidectomy, compared with 13.3% in the no-parathyroidectomy group (p = 0.003).

We assessed effects of sanitary pad distribution and RH education on girls in primary grade 7 in Kilifi, Kenya. METHODS A cluster randomized controlled trial design was used. Eligible clusters were all non-boarding schools in three sub-counties in Kilifi County that had a minimum of 25 girls enrolled in primary grade 7. 140 primary schools, 35 per arm, were randomly assigned to one of four study arms: (1) control; (2) sanitary pad distribution; (3) RH education; or (4) both sanitary pad distribution and RH education. Outcomes were school attendance, school engagement, RH knowledge and attitudes, gender norms, and self-efficacy. For outcomes measured both at baseline and endline, difference-in-differences (DID) models were estimated and for outcomes without baseline data available, analysis of covariance models were used. RESULTS The study enrolled 3489 randomly selected girls in primary grade 7, with a mean age of 14.4 (SD 1.5). Girls in arms 2 and 4 received on average 17.6 out of 20 packets of sanitary pads and girls in arms 3 and 4 participated on average in 21 out of 25 RH sessions. Ninety-four percent of the baseline sample was interviewed at the end of the intervention with no differential attrition by arm. There was no evidence of an effect on primary school attendance on arm 2 (coefficient [coef] 0.37, 95% CI - 0.73, 1.46), arm 3 (coef 0.14, 95% CI - 0.99, 1.26) or arm 4 (coef 0.58, 95% CI - .37, 1.52). There was increased positive RH attitudes for girls in arm 3 (DID coef. 0.63, 95% CI 0.40-0.86) and arm 4 (DID coef. 0.85, 95% CI 0.64, - 1.07). There was also an increase in RH knowledge, gender norms and self-efficacy in arms 3 and 4. CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that neither sanitary pad distribution nor RH education, on their own or together, were sufficient to improve primary school attendance. However, as the RH education intervention improved RH outcomes, the evidence suggests that sanitary pad distribution and RH education can be positioned in broader RH programming for girls.

Current predictions of tropical biotic responses to global warming are based on correlations between species elevational distributions and temperatures. Because biotic attritions, range shifts, and mountaintop extinctions result from complex demographic processes, predictive models must be based on mechanistic associations between temperature and fitness. Our study combines long-term temperature records with experimental demography to determine the contribution of local adaptation to organismal resilience in a warming world. On the Barva volcano in Costa Rica, Cephaloleia belti (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) displays high-elevation (960-2,100 m asl) and low-elevation (50-960 m asl) mitochondrial haplotypes. We reared haplotype cohorts at temperatures prevalent along the elevational gradient (i.e., 10°-30°C). Based on ambient temperatures recorded every half hour for 4 years, we projected average instantaneous population growth rates ([Formula: see text]) at current and future temperatures (i.e., +1° to 6°C) for each beetle haplotype. Haplotypes are adapted to local temperatures, but with a temperature increase beyond 2°C, both haplotypes will face lower-elevation demographic attritions and extinctions. Upper distribution limits serve as potential elevational refugia from global warming. This study shows how species resilience to global warming emerges from complex fitness responses of locally adapted phenotypes facing novel environments.","García-Robledo, Carlos; Baer, Christina S",The American naturalist,97,28

The pathophysiology of cancer is multifactorial and is also related to gut microbiota. Intestinal microbes are the useful resident of the healthy human. They play various aspects of human health including nutritional biotransformation, flushing of the pathogens, toxin neutralization, immune response, and onco-suppression. Disruption in the interactions among the gut microbiota, intestinal epithelium, and the host immune system are associated with gastrointestinal disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. Probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp.) have been regarded as beneficial to health and shown to play a significant role in immunomodulation and displayed preventive role against obesity, diabetes, liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, tumor progression, and cancer. OBJECTIVE The involvement of gut microorganisms in cancer development and prevention has been recognized as a balancing factor. The events of dysbiosis emphasize metabolic disorder and carcinogenesis. The gut flora potentiates immunomodulation and minimizes the limitations of usual chemotherapy. The significant role of prebiotics and probiotics on the improvement of immunomodulation and antitumor properties has been considered. METHODS I had reviewed the literature on the multidimensional activities of prebiotics and probiotics from the NCBI website database PubMed, Springer Nature, Science Direct (Elsevier), Google Scholar database to search relevant articles. Specifically, I had focused on the role of prebiotics and probiotics in immunomodulation and cancer prevention. RESULTS Prebiotics are the nondigestible fermentable sugars that selectively influence the growth of probiotic organisms that exert immunomodulation over the cancerous growth. The oncostatic properties of bacteria are mediated through the recruitment of cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, approaches have also been taken to use probiotics as an adjuvant in cancer therapy. CONCLUSION The present review has indicated that dysbiosis is the crucial factor in many pathological situations including cancer. Applications of prebiotics and probiotics exhibit the immune-surveillance as oncostatic effects. These events increase the possibilities of new therapeutic strategies for cancer prevention.","Samanta, Saptadip",Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,97,1

The purpose of this study was to retrospectively explore the value of high-fidelity simulators in an exercise that incorporates time and resource limitation as an optimal method of training health care personnel in mass-casualty care. METHODS Mass-casualty injury patterns from an explosive blast event were simulated for 12 victims using high-fidelity computerized simulators (HFCS). Programmed outcomes, based on the nature of injuries and conduct of participants, ranged from successful resuscitation and survival to death. The training exercise was conducted five times with different teams of health care personnel (n = 42). The exercise involved limited time and resources such as blood, ventilators, and imaging capability. Medical team performance was observed and recorded. Following the exercise, participants completed a survey regarding their training satisfaction, quality of the exercise, and their prior experiences with MCI simulations. The Likert scale responses from the survey were evaluated using mean with 95% confidence interval, as well as median and inter-quartile range. For the categorical responses, the frequency, proportions, and associated 95% confidence interval were calculated. RESULTS The mean rating on the quality of experiences related trainee survey questions (n = 42) was between 4.1 and 4.6 on a scale of 5.0. The mean ratings on a scale of 10.0 for quality, usefulness, and pertinence of the program were 9.2, 9.5, and 9.5, respectfully. One hundred percent of respondents believed that this type of exercise should be required for MCI training and would recommend this exercise to colleagues. The five medical team (n = 5) performances resulted in the number of deaths ranging from two (including the expectant victims) to six. Eighty percent of medical teams attempted to resuscitate the ""expectant"" infant and exhausted the O- blood supply. Sixty percent of medical teams depleted the supply of ventilators. Forty percent of medical teams treated ""delayed"" victims too early. CONCLUSION A training exercise using HFCS for mass casualties and employing limited time and resources is described. This exercise is a preferred method of training among participating health care personnel.","Jacobson, Phillip A; Severin, Paul N; Rumoro, Dino P; Shah, Shital",Prehospital and disaster medicine,97,33

Threatening seriously the stone fruit crops in Europe, RLB was added to both the EPPO A1 and priority pest lists of quarantine species. Molecular analyses highlighted that all specimens recovered in southern Italy share the same haplotype, different from the German one, supporting that the invasive process in Europe started from at least two independent introductions.

Despite this, there are no established cognitive remediation interventions available targeting EF in MDD. Hence, the primary aim of the present pre-registered randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of Goal Management Training (GMT), a metacognitive and strategy-based cognitive remediation intervention to improve EF in MDD. METHODS Sixty-three participants with current or previous mild or moderate MDD and self-reported executive deficits were included and randomized to nine sessions of either GMT (two hours, once weekly; n = 35) or computerized cognitive training (one hour, twice weekly; n = 28). Assessments were conducted at baseline (T1), immediately following training (T2), and at six-month follow-up (T3). The primary outcome measure was The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult version, pertained to daily life EF. Secondary outcome measures included additional EF assessments (performance-based measures and questionnaires), and depressive symptom severity. RESULTS Forty-three participants completed treatment. Both groups improved following training, and linear mixed model analyses revealed no statistically significant differences between the groups for any outcome measure. Additional exploratory within-group analyses revealed a statistically significant reduction of everyday executive dysfunction and reduced depressive symptoms at the six-month follow-up in GMT only. LIMITATIONS The study was single-blind, and the sample size was modest. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate comparable improvements in everyday and performance-based measures of EF, in addition to reductions in depressive symptoms following both GMT and CCT.","Hagen, Bjørn Ingulfsvann; Lau, Bjørn; Joormann, Jutta; Småstuen, Milada Cvancarova; Landrø, Nils Inge; Stubberud, Jan",Journal of affective disorders,97,16

MATERIAL AND METHODS Only patients with unruptured interstitial pregnancy evaluated by MRI and observed for at least a year after surgery were included. Initial evaluation was performed by measurement of serum β-human chorionic gonadotrophin level and ultrasonography. In suspicious cases, emergency MRI was performed to diagnose interstitial pregnancies with the exclusion of rudimentary horn pregnancy and angular pregnancy. Three-dimensional computed tomographic (CT) angiography was additionally performed if the uteroplacental neovascularization needed to be evaluated. Then, management procedures were individually determined along with the need for preoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for immediate devascularization, and for the local or systemic administration of methotrexate. Either laparoscopic cornuostomy or cornual resection was chosen to excise the gestational mass. RESULTS Five consecutive women with unruptured interstitial pregnancy were enrolled. One case each of rudimentary horn pregnancy and angular pregnancy was excluded. Three-dimensional CT angiography was performed in three cases due to increased vascular flow on color Doppler ultrasonography. Preoperative devascularization by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization was performed in two cases, in which a prominent neovascularized gestational mass was identified. Uterine preservation was achieved by cornuostomy or cornual resection in all cases. Two patients with a desire to become pregnant conceived spontaneously thereafter, followed by successful cesarean birth. CONCLUSION This small case series emphasizes that precise localization of gestational products in the interstitial portion of the fallopian tube by MRI can facilitate the minimally invasive management of unruptured interstitial pregnancy for uterine preservation.","Takeda, Akihiro; Koike, Wataru; Hayashi, Shotaro; Imoto, Sanae; Nakamura, Hiromi",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,97,17

To combat this situation, numerous strategies are being thought for either creating its antidote, vaccine, or agents that can prevent its infection. For enabling research on these strategies, several target proteins are identified where, Spike (S) protein is of great potential. S-protein interacts with human angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2) for entering the cell. S-protein is a large protein and a portion of it designated as a receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the key region that interacts with ACE2, following to which the viral membrane fuses with the alveolar membrane to enter the human cell. The hypothesis is to identify molecules from the pool of anticancer phytochemicals as a lead possessing the ability to interact and mask the amino acids of RBD, making them unavailable to form associations with ACE2. Such a molecule is termed as 'fusion inhibitor'. We hypothesized to identify fusion inhibitors from the NPACT library of anticancer phytochemicals. For this, all the molecules from the NPACT were screened using molecular docking, the five top hits (Theaflavin, Ginkgetin, Ursolic acid, Silymarin and Spirosolane) were analyzed for essential Pharmacophore features and their ADMET profiles were studied following to which the best two hits were further analyzed for their interaction with RBD using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. Binding free energy calculations were performed using MM/GBSA, proving these phytochemicals containing anticancer properties to serve as fusion inhibitors.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Owing to a shortage of geriatric teams and the vast number of older adults diagnosed with cancer each year, a web-based geriatric assessment may improve access to geriatric assessment for older adults. We systematically reviewed the literature to obtain the latest evidence for the design of our web-based geriatric assessment tool Comprehensive Health Assessment for My Plan. OBJECTIVE This review aimed to probe the following questions: what is the impact of providing health test results to older adults in a web-based environment without the presence of a health care provider for patient-centered outcomes, including satisfaction, perceived harm, empowerment, quality of life, and health care use (eg, hospitalization, physician visits, emergency room visits, and costs), and what recommendations do older adults and developers have for designing future apps or websites for older adults? METHODS This systematic review was guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis) statement. Studies were limited to publications in English that examined a web-based tool that provided test results to older adults (aged ≥65 years) without the presence of a health care provider. A health sciences librarian performed the search on November 29, 2019, on the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool Version 2018. The findings are summarized narratively and in tabular format. RESULTS A total of 26,898 titles and abstracts were screened by 2 independent reviewers, of which 94 studies were selected for a full-text review, and 9 studies were included in this review. There were only 2 randomized controlled trials of high quality that explored the effects of receiving health care results on the web via eHealth tools for older adults or provided evidence-based recommendations for designing such tools. Older adults were generally satisfied with receiving screening results via eHealth tools, and several studies suggested that receiving health screening results electronically improved participants' quality of life. However, user interfaces that were not designed with older adults in mind and older adults' lack of confidence in navigating eHealth tools proved challenging to eHealth uptake and use. All 9 studies included in this systematic review made recommendations on how to design eHealth tools that are intuitive and useful for older adults. CONCLUSIONS eHealth tools should incorporate specific elements to ensure usability for older adults. However, more research is required to fully elucidate the impact of receiving screening and results via eHealth tools without the presence of a health care provider for patient-centered outcomes in this target population.","McLean, Bianca; Hossain, Nazia; Donison, Valentina; Gray, Mikaela; Durbano, Sara; Haase, Kristen; Alibhai, Shabbir Muhammad Husayn; Puts, Martine",JMIR aging,97,5

For this to be possible, it is necessary to draw up protocols to guide the actions of both the patient and the professionals in the different stages of chronic renal disease.","Gómez-Beltrán, Piedras Albas; Domínguez Carranza, Estela; Medero Rubio, Francisca; Pérez Márquez, Manuela",Enfermeria clinica,97,19

In India, the spread of COVID19 infection and the subsequent lockdown coincided with a crucial period of the annual examination in almost all educational institutions. The pandemic has created hurdles in the conduct of examination due to many reasons, some of which are spread of infection and associated safety issues, lack of public transport for patients as well as the postgraduates in outstation and examiners, and lack of workforce due to round-the-clock service for rendering health services leading to difficulty in arranging logistics at the examination center. Currently, there are no guidelines or policies on how examinations need to be carried out during such a pandemic. Hence, there is an urgent need to look at solutions within the profession for the completion of examination. Teachers of psychiatry play an important role in the national mental health services. Their expertise can be valuable for finding solutions that work.

Typical HUS is associated with Shiga toxin while atypical HUS (aHUS) is due to overactivation of the alternative complement pathway. aHUS has numerous causes, including drugs, with rare reports of carfilzomib, a proteasome inhibitor used in multiple myeloma, as causative agent. Cases vary in presentation, presenting a diagnostic challenge. Historically, TMAs were treated with plasma exchange. aHUS, however, is considered refractory to plasma exchange and best treated with eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting C5, a terminal complement protein. We report a patient with history of multiple myeloma who presented with headaches, elevated blood pressure, petechiae, ecchymosis and haemolytic anaemia. His condition was determined to be carfilzomib-induced aHUS and he was successfully treated with eculizumab.

This has implications on radiological manifestation of cancer. Further, we evaluated changes observed in mammography. Materials and Methods This case control study was conducted from March 25th, 2020 to August 15th, 2020 at the Integrated Breast Care Centre, All India Institute of Medical Science Rishikesh (AIIMS), Rishikesh. Sonomammography was performed on follow-up patients who were on chemotherapy and were scheduled for surgery. Moreover, duration of delay from the last neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) cycle was recorded. Similar data in the pre-COVID-19 period from November 4th, 2019 to March 24th, 2020 was compared with post-COVID-19 data and was analyzed by SPSS Version 23. Results The study included 54 patients who presented between March 25th, 2020 and August 15th, 2020. Furthermore, the delay in NACT cycles has been shown to be associated with disease progression (p = 0.045). Subgroup analysis of treatment duration with various parameters revealed significant correlation between size, appearance of ulceration, and response evaluation (p<0.05). However, no significant association was found between duration of delay and the histological subtype of lesion (p>0.05). A substantial difference was seen in the evaluation of NACT response in pre- and post-COVID-19 time, with partial response (n = 39, 58.24%) seen as the most common response in pre-COVID-19 time and progressive disease (n = 28, 51.9%) as the most common response in post-COVID-19 time (p<0.001). Conclusion The coronavirus pandemic has severe impact on breast cancer management. A delay in NACT causes progression in cancer. This can be seen in ultrasound and mammogram.","Syed, Anjum; Kumari, Gangotri; Kapoor, Aakriti; Chaitanya, Satish; Sharda, Prateek; Chaudhary, Mriganki; Deori, Ananya; Gupta, Priyanka; Choudhary, Nilotpal; Rao, Shalinee; Ravi, Bina",European journal of breast health,97,1

METHODS We studied 42 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer who underwent TLDG between December 2011 and March 2013. Endoscopic linear staplers were used for intracorporeal anastomosis and patients were observed with endoscopic tracking six months after surgery. We retrospectively reviewed the outcome of the operation, the clinical pathological results, and the endoscopy results. RESULTS The mean duration of the operation for 42 patients was 228.3 ± 42.5 minutes and the mean time to complete the anastomosis was 12.18 ± 2.3 minutes. There were no mortalities and no cases of open conversion. Following the operation, 37 patients had stage IA, 5 in stage IB, and 3 in stage II gastric cancer. Abscesses were seen in 3 patients and 5 cases of stasis during the postoperative period. Duodenoscopy 6 months after the operation showed 11 cases of gastric stasis, 28 cases of bile reflux, and 1 new case of erosive gastritis. We did not observe contraction in any of the patients. CONCLUSION The overlap method for intracorporeal gastroduodenostomy, using an endoscopic linear stapler, can be considered a feasible and safe technique for the treatment of stomach cancer. However, a long-term comparative study is required to sufficiently evaluate our findings.","Jang, Chang Eun; Lee, Sang-Il",Annals of surgical treatment and research,97,33

However, although stent retrievers show improved flow restoration rates, their clinical benefits have been uncertain. OBJECTIVE To assess the incremental effect of using stent retrievers compared with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA; alteplase) alone or placebo/control. METHODS We conducted a pooled analysis of 4 studies using stent retrievers (Solitaire), IV tPA, or placebo/control. We applied the ischemic stroke risk score (www.sorcan.ca/iscore) to each participant to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics. We used a shift analysis to account for the potential benefits across the entire modified Rankin scale score at 90 days, adjusting for time-to-treatment, baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score, and ischemic stroke risk score. RESULTS Of the 915 participants in this analysis, 312 (34.1%) patients received placebo, 312 (34.1%) received tPA alone, 131 (14.4%) received stent retrievers alone, and 160 (17.5) received combined therapy (IV tPA plus stent retrievers). The shift analysis revealed that more patients remained independent at 90 days if receiving stent retrievers alone (number needed to treat 3.5) or combined with tPA (number needed to treat 3.1) compared with tPA alone. After adjustment, participants receiving stent retrievers alone (odds ratio, 2.95; 95% confidence interval, 1.48-5.89) or combined with tPA (odds ratio, 4.45; 95% confidence interval, 2.40-8.27) were more likely to be independent at 90 days compared with tPA alone. CONCLUSION Patients with acute ischemic stroke who received IV tPA or revascularization therapies had a higher likelihood of achieving independence at 3 months. Stent retriever technology combined with tPA was associated with the greatest benefit compared with placebo, tPA alone, or endovascular therapy alone.","Saposnik, Gustavo; Lebovic, Gerald; Demchuk, Andrew; Levy, Elad I; Ovbiagele, Bruce; Goyal, Mayank; Johnston, S Claiborne",Neurosurgery,97,16

Although ultrasound-guided (USG) TPVB has been described, there are no reports of USG multilevel TPVB for surgical anesthesia during PBCS. The aim of this prospective observational study was to determine the feasibility of performing USG multilevel TPVB, at the T1-T6 vertebral levels (6m-TPVB), and to evaluate its efficacy in providing surgical anesthesia for PBCS. Patients and Methods Twenty-five female patients undergoing PBCS received an USG 6m-TPVB for surgical anesthesia. Four milliliters of ropivacaine 0.5% (with epinephrine 1:200,000) was injected at each vertebral level. Dexmedetomidine infusion (0.1-0.5 µg.kg-1.h-1) was used for conscious sedation. Success of the block, for surgical anesthesia, was defined as being able to complete the PBCS without having to resort to rescue analgesia or convert to GA. Results The USG 6m-TPVB was successfully performed on all 25 patients but it was effective as the sole anesthetic in only 20% (5/25) of patients. The remaining 80% (20/25) reported pain during separation of the breast from the pectoralis major muscle and its fascia. Surgery was successfully completed using small doses of intravenous ketamine (mean total dose, 38.0±20.5 mg) as supplementary analgesia. Conclusion USG 6m-TPVB is technically feasible but does not consistently provide complete surgical anesthesia for PBCS that involves surgical dissection on the pectoralis major muscle and its fascia. Our data suggest that the pectoral nerves, which are not affected by a 6m-TPVB, are involved with afferent nociception.","Pangthipampai, Pawinee; Karmakar, Manoj K; Songthamwat, Banchobporn; Pakpirom, Jatuporn; Samy, Winnie",Journal of pain research,97,1

The aim of the current study was to examine the association in Guatemala, a region with elevated prevalences of both H pylori and NAFLD. Associations between H pylori and other metabolic conditions were also examined, as were associations between H hepaticus and H bilis and the metabolic conditions. MATERIALS & METHODS The analysis included 424 participants from a cross-sectional study in Guatemala. H pylori seropositivity was defined as positivity for ≥ 4 antigens. Seropositivities for H bilis and H hepaticus were defined as positivity for ≥ 2 antigens. NAFLD was estimated using the Fatty Liver Index and the Hepatic Steatosis Index. Other conditions examined were obesity, central obesity, hypercholesterolemia, low HDL, diabetes and metabolic syndrome (MetSyn). Prevalence odds ratios (POR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. RESULTS No overall associations between H pylori, H hepaticus, or H bilis and NAFLD or related metabolic conditions were found. Seropositivity for H pylori antigens CagA and VacA and H hepaticus antigen HH0713 was each significantly associated with NAFLD, however. In addition, associations were observed between the H pylori antigens HyuA, HP1564, and UreA and specified metabolic conditions. CONCLUSIONS While no overall associations between H pylori or Helicobacter species with NAFLD or related conditions were observed, some selected Helicobacter spp. antigens were associated with NAFLD. Further research is warranted to examine whether H. species are associated with any metabolic condition.","Alvarez, Christian S; Florio, Andrea A; Butt, Julia; Rivera-Andrade, Alvaro; Kroker-Lobos, María F; Waterboer, Tim; Camargo, Maria Constanza; Freedman, Neal D; Graubard, Barry I; Lazo, Mariana; Guallar, Eliseo; Groopman, John D; Ramírez-Zea, Manuel; McGlynn, Katherine A",Helicobacter,97,30

Methods We did a review of government documents and literature on air quality standards. We extracted and summarized the PM2.5 concentration limits effective before July 2020, noting whether standards were enforced, voluntary or target. We compared averaging methods and permitted periods of time that standards may be exceeded. We made a descriptive analysis of PM2.5 standards by population, total area and population density of jurisdictions. We also compared data on actual PM2.5 air quality against the standards. Findings We obtained data on standards from 62 jurisdictions worldwide, including 58 countries. Of the world's 136.06 million km2 land under national jurisdictions, 71.70 million km2 (52.7%) lack an official PM2.5 air quality standard, and 3.17 billion people live in areas without a standard. The existing standards ranged from 8 to 75 µg/m3, mostly higher than the World Health Organization guideline annual limit of < 10 µg/m3. The weakest PM2.5 standards were often exceeded, while the more stringent standards were often met. Several jurisdictions with the highest population density demonstrated compliance with relatively stringent standards. Conclusion The metrics used in PM2.5 ambient air quality standards should be harmonized worldwide to facilitate accurate assessment of risks associated with PM2.5 exposure. Population density alone does not preclude stringent PM2.5 standards. Modernization of standards can also include short-term standards to unmask PM2.5 fluctuations in high-pollution areas.","Nazarenko, Yevgen; Pal, Devendra; Ariya, Parisa A",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,97,16

Here, we report the long-term results of LSGs in comparison to those of gastric bypass surgeries. METHODS A prospectively collected bariatric database from Ming-Shen General Hospital was retrospectively studied. Five hundred nineteen morbidly obese patients (mean age 36.0 ± 9.1 years old (14-71), 74.6 % female, mean body mass index (BMI) 37.5 ± 6.1 kg/m(2)) underwent LSG as a primary bariatric procedure from 2006 to 2012 at our institute. The operative parameters, weight loss, laboratory data, and quality of life were followed. Another two matched groups of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and laparoscopic single anastomosis (mini-) gastric bypass (SAGB) patients who were matched in terms of age, sex, and BMI were recruited for comparisons. RESULTS The mean surgical time for LSG was 113.5 ± 31.3 min, and the mean blood loss was 49.1 + 100.9 ml. The rate of major complications was 1.6 %, and the average length of the postoperative stay was 3.0 ± 1.7 days. The operation times of the RYGB patients were longer than those of both the LSG and SAGB patients. The RYGB and SAGB patients experienced higher major complication rate than the LSG patients. The weight loss of the LSG patient at 5 years was 28.3 + 8.9 %, and the mean BMI was 27.1 + 4.3. The RYGB patients exhibited a 5-year weight loss similar to the LSG patients, and the SAGB patients exhibited greater weight loss than both of the other groups. Both the RYGB and SAGB patients exhibited significantly better glycemic control and lower blood lipids than the LSG patients, but the LSG patients exhibited a lesser micronutrient deficiency than the RYGB and SAGB groups. All three of the groups exhibited improved quality of life at 5 years after surgery, and there was no significant between-group difference in this measure. CONCLUSIONS LSG appears to be an ideal bariatric surgery, and the efficacy of this surgery is not inferior to that of gastric bypass.","Lee, Wei-Jei; Pok, Eng-Hong; Almulaifi, Abdullah; Tsou, Ju Juin; Ser, Kong-Han; Lee, Yi-Chih",Obesity surgery,97,27

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a newer procedure being done with increasing frequency. Randomized comparisons of LSG and other bariatric procedures are limited. We present the results of the first prospective randomized trial comparing LSG and RYGB in the Polish population. AIM To assess the efficacy and safety of LSG versus RYGB in the treatment of morbid obesity and obesity-related comorbidities. MATERIAL AND METHODS Seventy-two morbidly obese patients were randomized to RYGB (36 patients) or LSG (36 patients). Both groups were comparable regarding age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and comorbidities. The follow-up period was at least 12 months. Baseline and 6 and 12 month outcomes were analyzed including assessment of percent excess weight lost (%EWL), reduction in BMI, morbidity (minor, major, early and late complications), mortality, reoperations, comorbidities and nutritional deficiencies. RESULTS There was no 30-day mortality and no significant difference in major complication rate (0% after RYGB and 8.3% after LSG, p > 0.05) or minor complication rate (16.6% after RYGB and 10.1% after LSG, p > 0.05). There were no early reoperations after RYGB and 2 after LSG (5.5%) (p > 0.05). Weight loss was significant after RYGB and LSG but there was no difference between both groups at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. At 12 months %EWL in RYGB and LSG groups reached 64.2% and 67.6% respectively (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in the overall prevalence of comorbidities and nutritional deficiencies. CONCLUSIONS Both LSG and RYGB produce significant weight loss at 6 and 12 months after surgery. The procedures are equally effective with regard to %EWL, reduction in BMI and amelioration of comorbidities at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and RYGB are comparably safe techniques with no significant differences in minor and major complication rates at 6 and 12 months.","Paluszkiewicz, Rafał; Kalinowski, Piotr; Wróblewski, Tadeusz; Bartoszewicz, Zbigniew; Białobrzeska-Paluszkiewicz, Janina; Ziarkiewicz-Wróblewska, Bogna; Remiszewski, Piotr; Grodzicki, Mariusz; Krawczyk, Marek",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,97,1

METHODS Fifty male Landrace/Large White neonatal piglets were studied: ten of them were allocated in group A (control group, SHAM-operated). In group B (forty animals, experimental group) normocapnic hypoxia was induced by decreasing inspired concentration of O2 to 6%-8%. When the animals developed bradycardia or severe hypotension, reoxygenation was initiated. The animals of group B were allocated in 4 subgroups of 10, according to the concentration of O2 they were resuscitated with (groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 received 18%, 21%, 40%, and 100% O2, resp.). RESULTS Control group animals did not show any significant endothelial lesions. Contrarily, endothelial lesions were detected in all experimental group cases. When these lesions were analyzed in the different heart zones, no significant difference in their incidence was observed; analyzing the frequency in the animals of the 4 subgroups, only microthrombosis showed a higher frequency in animals in groups 4 and 3. CONCLUSIONS Endothelial damage represents a diffuse pathological feature in the myocardial vessels of piglets subjected to normocapnic hypoxia and resuscitation suggesting a possible role of hyperoxygenation in aggravating endothelial damage.","Faa, Armando; Xanthos, Theodoros; Fanos, Vassilios; Fanni, Daniela; Gerosa, Clara; Pampaloni, Pietro; Pais, Maria Elena; Faa, Gavino; Iacovidou, Nicoletta",BioMed research international,97,19

Treatment effects have been assessed in patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma in clinical trials and retrospective studies. While the results of these studies led to FDA approval for both populations, a portion of the neuro-oncology and neurosurgery community remains skeptical of TTF. Thus, this review aims to systematically summarize and evaluate prior studies investigating the efficacy and safety of TTF in patients with high-grade gliomas. METHODS A systematic review of the literature was performed according to PRISMA guidelines from database inception through February 2019. To be included, studies must have investigated the efficacy of TTF in adult high-grade glioma patients. RESULTS In total, 852 studies were initially identified, 9 of which met final inclusion criteria. In total, 1191 patients were identified who received TTF. Included studies consisted of two pilot clinical trials, two randomized clinical trials, and five retrospective studies. In randomized clinical trials, TTF improved survival for newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients but not for recurrent glioblastoma patients. Adverse skin reactions were the primary adverse effect associated with TTF. CONCLUSION While TTF has been evaluated for safety and efficacy in a number of studies, concerns remain regarding study design, quality of life, and cost of therapy. Further investigation is needed regarding the therapy, and ongoing trials are already underway to provide more data regarding therapy outcomes and interactions in combination regimens.","Shah, Pavan P; White, Taija; Khalafallah, Adham M; Romo, Carlos G; Price, Carrie; Mukherjee, Debraj",Journal of neuro-oncology,97,32

METHODS The researchers conducted a focused review of the published literature describing how HIT can be used to support safe, patient-centred, coordinated care to patients who are affected by Ebola (an emerging disease). RESULTS New and emerging diseases present opportunities for repurposing existing technologies and for stimulating the development of new HIT innovation. Innovative technologies may be developed such as new software used for tracking patients during new or emerging disease outbreaks or by repurposing and extending existing technologies so they can be used to support patients, families and health professionals who may have been exposed to a disease. The paper describes the development of new technologies and the repurposing and extension of existing ones (such as electronic health records) using the most recent outbreak of Ebola as an example.","Borycki, E; Cummings, E; Dexheimer, J W; Gong, Y; Kennebeck, S; Kushniruk, A; Kuziemsky, C; Saranto, K; Weber, J; Takeda, H",Yearbook of medical informatics,97,5

Our study was designed to highlight by means of numeric simulations the correlation between aneurysm sac pulsatility and the risk of rupture through the mechanical properties of the wall. MATERIALS AND METHODS In accordance with previous work suggesting a correlation between the risk of rupture and the material properties of cerebral aneurysms, 12 fluid-structure interaction computations were performed on 12 ""patient-specific"" cases, corresponding to typical shapes and locations of cerebral aneurysms. The variations of the aneurysmal volume during the cardiac cycle (ΔV) are compared by using wall material characteristics of either degraded or nondegraded tissues. RESULTS Aneurysms were located on 6 different arteries: middle cerebral artery (4), anterior cerebral artery (3), internal carotid artery (1), vertebral artery (1), ophthalmic artery (1), and basilar artery (1). Aneurysms presented different shapes (uniform or multilobulated) and diastolic volumes (from 18 to 392 mm3). The pulsatility (ΔV/V) was significantly larger for a soft aneurysmal material (average of 26%) than for a stiff material (average of 4%). The difference between ΔV, for each condition, was statistically significant: P=.005. CONCLUSIONS The difference in aneurysmal pulsatility as highlighted in this work might be a relevant patient-specific predictor of aneurysm risk of rupture.","Sanchez, M; Ecker, O; Ambard, D; Jourdan, F; Nicoud, F; Mendez, S; Lejeune, J-P; Thines, L; Dufour, H; Brunel, H; Machi, P; Lobotesis, K; Bonafe, A; Costalat, V",AJNR.

Epigenetic machinery permits mammalian cells to integrate environmental signals2, however, how these pathways are finely tuned by diverse cues from commensal bacteria is not well understood. Here, we reveal a highly selective pathway through which microbiota-derived inositol phosphate regulates histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) activity in the intestine. Despite abundant HDAC inhibitors in the intestine such as butyrate, we unexpectedly found that HDAC3 activity was sharply increased in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) of microbiota-replete mice compared to germ-free mice. This discordance was reconciled by finding that commensal bacteria, including E. coli, stimulated HDAC activity through metabolism of phytate and inositol trisphosphate production. Intestinal exposure to inositol trisphosphate and phytate ingestion both promoted recovery following intestinal damage. Remarkably, inositol trisphosphate also induced growth of patient-derived intestinal organoids, stimulated HDAC3-dependent proliferation, and countered butyrate inhibition of colonic growth. Collectively, these data reveal inositol trisphosphate as a microbiota-derived metabolite that activates a mammalian histone deacetylase to promote epithelial repair. Thus, HDAC3 represents a converging epigenetic sensor of distinct metabolites that calibrates host responses to diverse microbial signals.","Wu, Shu-En; Hashimoto-Hill, Seika; Woo, Vivienne; Eshleman, Emily M; Whitt, Jordan; Engleman, Laura; Karns, Rebekah; Denson, Lee A; Haslam, David B; Alenghat, Theresa",Nature,97,19

We modified the Vaccine Hesitancy Scale to target adult vaccines and provide measures of its reliability and validity relative to influenza vaccine uptake and COVID-19 vaccination acceptance in cross-sectional internet surveys in the United States and in China. We assessed the impact of vaccine hesitancy on influenza and COVID-19 vaccination using multivariable regression modeling, which informed concurrent validity of the adult Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (aVHS). Among 1103 participants in the March 2020 China survey, 5.4% would not accept a COVID-19 vaccine, whereas this figure was 18.8% for the March 2020 US survey and 27.3% for the June 2020 US survey. The aVHS exhibits good internal consistency in all three surveys. Models adjusted for age, gender and income level show that prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was a fraction as high in those who scored higher on the VHS than those who scored lower on all three surveys. Prevalence of past and future flu vaccine acceptance was a fraction as high in those with higher aVHS scores than those with lower scores. Prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance is lower in those with higher vaccine hesitancy scores, which supports the scale's concurrent validity. The aVHS exhibits good internal consistency, making it a valid and reliable tool for measuring vaccination uptake.","Akel, Kaitlyn B; Masters, Nina B; Shih, Shu-Fang; Lu, Yihan; Wagner, Abram L",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,97,15

For the virus to engage in host-membrane-fusion, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the human transmembrane surface protease, TMPRSS2, to cleave and activate the spike protein. Camostat mesylate, an orally available well-known serine protease inhibitor, is a potent inhibitor of TMPRSS2 and has been hypothesized as a potential antiviral drug against COVID-19. In vitro human cell and animal studies have shown that camostat mesylate inhibits virus-cell membrane fusion and hence viral replication. In mice, camostat mesylate treatment during acute infection with influenza, also dependent on TMPRSS2, leads to a reduced viral load. The decreased viral load may be associated with an improved patient outcome. Because camostat mesylate is administered as an oral drug, it may be used in outpatients as well as inpatients at all disease stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection if it is shown to be an effective antiviral agent. Clinical trials are currently ongoing to test whether this well-known drug could be repurposed and utilized to combat the current pandemic. In the following, we will review current knowledge on camostat mesylate mode of action, potential benefits as an antiviral agent, and ongoing clinical trials.","Breining, Peter; Frølund, Anne Lier; Højen, Jesper Falkesgaard; Gunst, Jesper Damsgaard; Staerke, Nina B; Saedder, Eva; Cases-Thomas, Manuel; Little, Paul; Nielsen, Lars Peter; Søgaard, Ole S; Kjolby, Mads",Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,97,5

RECENT FINDING Intestinal stem-cell-derived culture systems are self-organizing three-dimensional organotypic cultures that recapitulate many cellular, architectural and functional aspects of the human intestine. Progress has been made in the development of methods to incorporate additional cell lineages and physiological cues to better mimic the complexity of the intestine. Current model systems have facilitated both the study of gastrointestinal infections and interactions with normally nonpathogenic microbial residents of the gastrointestinal tract. These studies have illustrated how live microbes, or their metabolites, ligands and virulence factors influence epithelial cell differentiation, maintenance, repair, function and intestine development. SUMMARY Organotypic models are invaluable tools for studying host-microbe interactions that complement in-vivo experimental model systems. These models have evolved in terms of complexity and fidelity. The stem-cell-based models are already at forefront for studying host-microbe interactions and with continued development, the future looks even more promising.","Dheer, Rishu; Young, Vincent B",Current opinion in gastroenterology,97,1

We examined outcomes (hemodialysis, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission and death) in cancer patients with normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) treated in a tertiary referral center with COVID-19 infection, who developed AKI within 30 days of diagnosis. Methods: All patient data - demographics, labs, comorbidities and outcomes - were aggregated and analyzed in the Syntropy platform, Palantir Foundry ('Foundry'), as part of the Data-Driven Determinants of COVID-19 Oncology Discovery Effort (D3CODE) protocol at MD Anderson. The cohort was defined by the following: (1) positive COVID-19 test;(2) baseline eGFR &gt;60 ml/min/1.73m2most temporally proximal lab results within 30 days prior to the patient's infection. AKI was defined by an absolute change of creatinine ≥0.3 within 30 days after the positive COVID-19 test. KaplanMeier analysis was used for survival estimates at specific time periods and multivariate Cox Proportional cause-specific Hazard model regression to determine hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals for major outcomes. Results: 635 patients with Covid-19 infection had a baseline eGFR &gt;60 ml/min/1.73m2. Of these patients, 124 (19.5%) developed AKI. Patients with AKI were older, mean age of 61+/- 13.2 vs 56.9 +/- 14.3 years (p=0.002) and more Hypertensive (69.4% vs 56.4%, p=0.011). AKI patients were more likely to have pneumonia (63.7% vs 37%, p&lt;0.001), cardiac arrhythmias (39.5% vs 20.7%, p&lt;0.001) and myocardial infarction (15.3% vs 8.8%, p=0.046). These patients had more hematologic malignancies (35.1% vs 19%, p=0.005), with no difference between non metastatic vs metastatic disease (p=0.284). There was no significant difference in other comorbidities including smoking, diabetes, hypothyroidism and liver disease. AKI patients were more likely to require dialysis (2.4% vs 0.2%, p=0.025), mechanical ventilation (16.1% vs 1.8%, p&lt;0.001), ICU admission (43.5% vs 11.5%, p&lt;0.001) within 30 days, and had a higher mortality at 90 days of admission (20.2% vs 3.7%, p&lt;0.001). Multivariate Cox Proportional cause-specific Hazard model regression analysis identified history of Diabetes Mellitus (HR 10.8, CI 2.42 - 48.4, p=0.001) as an independent risk factor associated with worse outcomes. Mortality was higher in patients with COVID-19 infection that developed AKI compared with those who did not developed AKI (survival estimate 150 days vs 240 days, p=0.0076). Conclusions: In cancer patients treated at a tertiary cancer center with COVID-19 infection and no history of CKD, the presence of AKI is associated with worse outcomes including higher 90 day mortality, ICU stay and mechanical ventilation. Older age and hypertension are major risk factors, where being diabetic was associated with worse clinical outcomes.","Simbaqueba, C.; Mamlouk, O.; Dickson, K.; Halm, J.; Mandayam, S.; Turin, A.; D039,; Achiardi, D.; Franco-Vega, M.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,97,1

Since, the infection crossed geographical barriers, the WHO permanently named the causing disease as COVID-2019 by declaring it a pandemic situation. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus causing a wide range of pathological conditions from common cold symptoms to pneumonia and fatal severe respiratory syndrome. Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has revealed 96% identity to the bat coronavirus and 79.6% sequence identity to the previous SARS-CoV. The main protease (known as 3C-like proteinase/ Mpro) plays a vital role during the infection with the processing of replicase polyprotein thus offering an attractive target for therapeutic interventions. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro shares 97% sequence identity, with 12 variable residues but none of them present in the catalytic and substrate binding site. With the high level of sequence and structural similarity and absence of any drug/vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, drug repurposing against Mpro is an effective strategy to combat COVID-19. Here, we report a detailed comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with SARS-CoV Mpro using molecular dynamics simulations to assess the impact of 12 divergent residues on the molecular microenvironment of Mpro. A structural comparison and analysis is made on how these variable residues affects the intra-molecular interactions between key residues in the monomer and biologically active dimer form of Mpro. The present MD simulations study concluded the change in microenvironment of active-site residues at the entrance (T25, T26, M49 and Q189), near the catalytic region (F140, H163, H164, M165 and H172) and other residues in substrate binding site (V35T, N65S, K88R and N180K) due to 12 mutation incorporated in the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. It is also evident that SARS-CoV-2 dimer is more stable and less flexible state compared to monomer which may be due to these variable residues, mainly F140, E166 and H172 which are involved in dimerization. This also warrants a need for inhibitor design considering the more stable dimer form. The mutation accumulated in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro indirectly reconfigures the key molecular networks around the active site conferring a potential change in SARS-CoV-2, thus posing a challenge in drug repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19. The new networks and changes in microenvironment identified by our work might guide attempts needed for repurposing and identification of new Mpro inhibitors.","Parmar, Meet; Thumar, Ritik; Patel, Bhumi; Athar, Mohd; Jha, Prakash C.; Patel, Dhaval",bioRxiv,97,5

Design/Methodology/Approach: A self-administered online questionnaire was collected from 271 individual investors to examine the association between big-five personality traits and trading frequency. Demographic information and investment behaviours of investors were also included in the study. The multinomial logit regression model was used to test the research hypotheses. Research findings: Findings show that personality traits such as openness to experience and agreeableness have a significant influence on trading frequency. Demographic factors and investment behaviours such as gender, household income level, years of investment experience and type of investor all have a significant positive relationship with trading frequency. Theoretical contribution/Originality: This study contributes to the current investor behaviour literature in Malaysia, which remains to be very limited, especially during a global health crisis. The study indicates that personality traits, demographic, socio-economic factors, and investment behaviours affect the trading frequency of Malaysian investors. Practitioner/Policy implication: This study offers insights for financial institutions and individual investors on the type of personality traits, demographic, socio-economic factors, and investment behaviours that drive excess trading during a global health crisis. The findings provide important contributions to avoid serious mistakes in investment analysis and trading profitable investment strategies, thus improving individual and team performance. Research limitation/Implications: Some results are not significant and may be limited due to the small sample size used in this study. Future research could recruit more retail investors to confirm the significance level of those variables. Besides, the study can be conducted after the COVID-19 pandemic to explore whether there is any significant difference in the variables during and after the global health crisis.","Chin, P.

We investigated the measures the top 35 UK universities receiving most Medical Research Council funding have taken to ensure global equitable access to health technologies in technology transfer. In October 2020 we sent Freedom Of Information requests and analysed universities' websites, to (i.) assess institutional strategies on the patenting and licensing of COVID-19-related health technologies, (ii.) identify all COVID-19-related health technologies licensed or patented, and (iii.) record whether universities engaged with the Open-COVID pledge, COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP), or Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM) COVID-19 licensing guidelines. Except for the Universities of Oxford and Edinburgh, UK universities have not updated their institutional strategies during the pandemic. Nine universities licensed 22 COVID-19 health technologies. Imperial College London disclosed 10 patents relevant to COVID-19. No UK universities participate in the Open-COVID Pledge or C-TAP, but discussions are ongoing. The University of Bristol signed up to the AUTM guidelines. Despite several COVID-19 health technologies being developed by UK universities, our findings suggest minimal engagement with measures that may promote equitable access. We suggest that universities review their technology transfer policies and implement global equitable access strategies for COVID-19 health technologies.","Keestra, S.

While most events of this kind can be postponed or cancelled, democratic elections are key elements of any democratic regime and should be upheld if at all possible. Consequently, proper planning is required to establish the highest possible level of safety to both voters and scrutineers. In this paper, we present the novel and innovative way how the municipal council and district council elections in Vienna were planned and conducted using an agent-based simulation model. Key target of this process was to avoid queues in front of polling stations to reduce the risk of related infection clusters. In cooperation with a hygiene expert, we defined necessary precautions that should be met during the election in order to avoid the spread of COVID-19. In a next step, a simulation model was established and parametrized and validated using data from previous elections. Furthermore, the planned conditions were simulated to see whether excessive queues in front of any polling stations could form, as these could on the one hand act as an infection herd, and on the other hand, turn voters away. Our simulation identified some polling stations where long queues could emerge, however, splitting up these electoral branches resulted in a smooth election across all of Vienna. Looking back, the election did not lead to a significant increase of COVID-19 incidences. Therefore, it can be concluded that careful planning led to a safe election, despite the pandemic.","Weibrecht, N.; Roessler, M.; Emrich, S.; Popper, N.",,97,16

The levels of food security in the world’s households, especially in Mexico, have decreased. When people do not have food security, their health is compromised and they have financial problems;on the other hand, environmental deterioration has a link with food security. The purpose of this review is to analysis of the current situation in Mexico of food security, environmental health and economy, the main lessons learned in these areas and their proposals integrating public policies. A review was carried out in the main databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts y PAIS Index) with the following keywords and according to the MeSH terms: Food security, food insecurity, environmental health, public policies, environmental, production, integrating the word COVID-19 in English and Spanish. Only 44.5% of Mexican households presented food security. For food insecurity, 22.6% had moderate and severe food insecurity, while 32.9% had mild insecurity. Food insecurity and the health impacts of environmental origin (waste management during the coronavirus pandemic, water contaminated by bacteria, viruses, and toxins;air pollution) generates impacts on economic activity by not offering food that meets health regulations. Without the application of cost-effective measures and interventions for the prevention and control of patients with obesity, the direct costs for 2023 will amount to 9 million dollars, which worsens the household economy. Despite having laws and policies on the right to food, a healthy environment (water), and opportunities for economic growth, these human rights are not fulfilled. The conclusion is that it is necessary to use a health and agroecological model to promote public policies (health, environment, and economy) that aims to prevent the discussed issues, with multidisciplinary and intersectoral interventions (government, academia, researchers, civil society organizations, industry, and population). This upholds the human right that all people should enjoy an adequate, healthy environment and have access to high-quality food.","Monroy-Torres, Rebeca Castillo-Chávez Ángela Carcaño-Valencia Erika Hernández-Luna Marco Caldera-Ortega Alex Serafín-Muñoz Alma Linares-Segovia Benigno Medina-Jiménez Karen Jiménez-Garza Octavio Méndez-Pérez Monserrat López-Briones Sergio",Sustainability,97,19

It is emphasized here that the Italian Constitution does not contain, unlike other experiences nearby, an exact definition of the state of emergency or exception, which allows an open reading of the taking of “measures necessary for the reestablishment of public order and safety” and of the suspension of the effectiveness of the fundamental rights provided for. We investigate the governing concepts for the declaration of the state of emergency and the interventions made at the level of the civil protection code by means of decree-laws. Thereby, the numerous measures of the state of emergency caused by the pandemic form the catch that gives rise to conflicts with fundamental rights, from the right to free movement or health to even political participation. Finally, it is highlighted that these infractions give rise to the recognition of minority agendas that had been neglected in society and that suffered aggravation due to the impacts of the health crisis, such as the situation of women, prisoners and foreigners. © 2021.

We demonstrated that the physical capture efficiency of the collection system was over 99% for particle sizes from 0.3 to 10 µm. We further evaluated the biochemical capture efficiency of the collection system using mass spectrometry approaches and showed that the biochemical information of viruses and microorganisms was well preserved.

One English ambulance service recruited existing supernumerary student paramedics into a new, paid, hybrid role, working as one half of a double-crewed ambulance team.MethodsTen student paramedics and two university lecturers were interviewed remotely in one-to-one sessions with a single interviewer. Students participated from 3 of 4 partner universities, and lecturers from 2 of the 4. Their responses were transcribed and coded into a framework of the four processes of organisational entry: analysis, recruitment, selection, and induction.ResultsThe participants described barriers and facilitators to the success of the scheme in all four processes. Analysis: job descriptions and working conditions were not always clear to interviewees. Recruitment: some students described feeling under pressure to take part. Lecturers criticised communications, particularly around some of their student paramedics who had withdrawn from study. Selection: students were critical of some aspects of physical assessment being omitted for this new role, but later reinstated for subsequent paramedic recruitment events. Induction: most students praised the initial training and their induction onto ambulance stations, but many felt they should have been given driver training. Lecturers raised concerns that students at risk of failing in placement may not be supported adequately in this new role. Almost all participants praised the scheme’s intentions and overall delivery, and some suggested a similar role bears consideration for future business-as-usual university placements.ConclusionsParticipants were broadly positive about this scheme, with some suggesting that elements of this hybrid role could feature in a post-pandemic student paramedic programme. Limitations include recall bias and response bias, particularly in that students who declined to take part in the scheme also declined to take part in this interview study.","Miller, Joshua",Emergency Medicine Journal : EMJ,97,1

Several mobile applications have been proposed, in particular to help limit or even stop the spread of the virus. In this paper, we propose a mobile data collection application, LISUNGIcovid19. This application has been built on the basis of the Open Data Kit (ODK) platform. The proposed solution offers both a mobile application and a data server to store, visualize and analyze the collected data. Although there are several applications created in this context of covid-19 such as STOPcovid or Wiqaytna, our solution is distinguished by the rapid adaptation of its data collection form according to the evolution of lockdown exit or renewed lockdown strategy adopted by the authorities. It will help decision-makers in the evaluation of their strategy and possibly the planning of lockdown exit and thus ensure a good management of the way out of this health crisis. The data collected by LISUNGIcovid19, as well as the analysis it proposes of this data, will enable the competent authorities to take the decision to quarantine, or isolate a city, a neighborhood or a group of individuals;or to start planning a progressive lockdown exit or even a new social isolation if necessary. The case study carried out in Morocco to test LISUNGIcovid19 helped to understand the classification of the cities of Casablanca, Rabat and Sal ' e in zone 2 during the first phase of lockdown exit and then in zone 1 during its second phase;while the cities of Kenitra and Marrakech remained in zone 2 during both phases.","Bokonda, P.

The preliminary assessment of the collected material showed that there was real estate in the database whose price did not have market characteristics. For the correct formulation of the valuation model, it is necessary to detect and eliminate or reduce the impact of these properties on the valuation results. In this study, multivariate analysis was used and three methods of detecting outliers were verified. The database of 8812 residential premises traded on the primary market in Krakow was analyzed. In order to detect outliers, the following indices were determined: projection matrix, Mahalanobis distances, standardized chi test and Cook distances. Critical values were calculated based on the formulas proposed in the publication. The probability level was P = 0.95. The article shows that the selected methods of eliminating outliers-the methods of standardized residuals and the Cook's distance method give similar regression models. Further analysis (with the use of classification tree methods) made it possible to distinguish zones that are homogeneous in terms of price dispersion. In these zones, a set of features influencing real estate prices were determined.","Jasinska, E.; Preweda, E.",Sustainability,97,16

Methods: An exploratory study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, from July 13th to July 26th 2020, in an isolation facility at the COVID-designated Sola hospital in Ahmedabad, India. A total of 201 inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were included in this study. We assessed the presence and severity of psychiatric symptoms using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Results: Of the 201 COVID-19 patients, 63 (31.3%), 36 (18%), 16 (8%) and 14 (7%) experienced anxiety, tension, somatic concern and depressed mood respectively. The effect of the severity of COVID-19 on the mean of the total BPRS score was statistically significant (F = 17.2, p = 0.000). In the severe COVID-19 group, the mean of the total BPRS score (22.6 +/- 4.8) was significantly higher than in the moderate (20.3 +/- 4.0) and mild (19.1 +/- 2.2) COVID-19 groups. High levels of serum ferritin, IL-6 and D-dimer were associated with the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms like hallucinatory behavior and disorientation. Conclusions: The majority of COVID-19 patients experienced anxiety, tension and somatic concern. The presence of serious psychiatric symptoms like hallucinatory behavior and disorientation were predominantly seen in severe COVID-19 patients with significantly high serum inflammation and coagulation markers.","Khanpara, B.

We validated the ability of these optimised methods to perform absolute quantification of host DNA in 200 stool DNA extracts from samples that were serially collected from three healthy individuals and three hospitalised patients. These specimens allowed assessment of host DNA day-to-day variability in stool specimens with widely varying physical characteristics (i.e., Bristol scores).

The Swedish Board for Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) provided anonymised tabulated summary data for further analysis. We compared numbers of COVID-19 associated death in individuals with SMD (cases) and without SMD (controls). We calculated the odds ratio (OR) for the whole sample and by age group and four potential risk factors, namely diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic lung disease.ResultsThe sample comprised of 7,923,859 individuals, 103,999 with SMD and 7,819,860 controls. There were 130 (0.1%) COVID-19 associated deaths in the SMD group and 4945 (0.06%) in the control group, corresponding to an OR of 1.98 (CI 1.66-2.35;p < 0.001). The odds were fourfold in the age group between 60 and 79 years. Cardiovascular diseases increased the odds by 50%.

The results of the research showed that 83.38% of students in low-income families have been able to participate in online education at home during the pandemic, while 16.62% of students in low-income families have been unable to do so. The absence of computers, smartphones, and broadband Internet access in low-income households reduces the likelihood of children being able to participate in online education at home. In terms of accessing online education at home, students from urban areas have obvious advantages over those from rural ones, and students from minimum living guarantee families have obvious advantages over those from marginal minimum living guarantee ones. This study also showed that the presence of online education-related amenities, including computers, smartphones, and Internet access, mediates the relationship between the subsistence allowance system, Hukou, and accessibility of online education.

COVID-19 is a coronavirus-induced infectious disease. Most people worldwide got infected with this virus and became mild to moderately ill with respiratory related problems. Most infected individuals who experienced mild to moderate illness/ disease and without hospitalization recovered. Yet older people with underlying medical conditions are more likely to experience severe diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer. As specific vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 is not yet prescribed, it is a tough task to prescribe a common medicinal procedure. There are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. This work presents an application that allots medicines to the one who tested positive. This proceeds after checking patients medical data which include BP, diabetes, cancer, alcoholic habits etc.,. Variations in the patient data originated from various sources with several medical concerns with different specifications is useful in evaluating and allotting proper medical course for COVID- 19 patient treatment.

Design / Methodology / Approach: Initially, a brief bibliographic research was carried out to base some information presented in the text. Later, the authors of this viewpoint discussed their ideas and established the reflections presented here, many of them based on their experiences and the Brazilian context. Finally, the final considerations were established. Results: The main reflections are directed in the sense that most Brazilian companies have felt harshly the consequences of the economic crisis resulting from the pandemic of Covid-19 and, in some way, they need to rethink some of their administrative practices. In this scenario of profound organizational changes, we believe that the management standards of the International Organization for Standardization can be characterized as an important knowledge base, since they present information of high credibility, widely debated by experts and that are easily accessible to Brazilian managers in different themes. Limitations of the investigation: Since it is a viewpoint, part of the information presented here are the perceptions and considerations of the authors. Practical implications: This viewpoint shows that the standards of the International Organization for Standardization can be used as an important tool for management systems focused on innovation and employee skills management.

The rapid turnover of ocular surface epithelium and microbial colonization of the eyelids are continual sources of DNA in tears. Here, we determine the principal sources of endonuclease activity in tears. METHODS: Endonucleases in human tears were identified after Sephadex G100 gel filtration. DNA hydrolyzing activity was measured by the conversion pUC19 plasmid DNA to its circular form in agarose gels. Fractions with endonuclease activity were further isolated using a combination ConA-Sepharose DNA, oligo (dT) cellulose, and anion exchange chromatographies. The molecular weights of the DNA hydrolyzing proteins were estimated in zymograms and by calibration of size exclusion chromatography. DNase activities were characterized for activity at a variety of pH and ion concentrations as well as in the presence of inhibitors including NiCl(2), ZnCl(2), G-actin, and aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA). To determine the mode of hydrolysis, the cleaved ends of the DNA digested by tear DNases were analyzed by 3′ and 5′ end labeling using either terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase or polynucleotide kinase with or without pretreatment with alkaline phosphatase. RESULTS: Tear lipocalin (TL) accounts for over 75% of the DNA catalytic activity in tears while a second endonuclease, ~34 kDa, is responsible for less than 24% of the activity. Both are Mg(2+) dependent enzyme endonucleases that are enhanced by Ca(2+), active at physiologic pH, inhibited by aurintricarboxylic acid, and catalyze hydrolysis of DNA to produce 3′-OH/5′P ends. However, the two enzymes can be distinguished by the inhibitory effect of NiCl(2) and the sizes of the cleaved DNA fragments. CONCLUSIONS: Two magnesium dependent extracellular endonucleases were identified in tears that are different from other major human extracellular nucleases. TL is the principal endonuclease in human tear fluid. Tear endonucleases have unique characteristics that differ from other known human endonucleases.","Yusifov, Taleh N.; Abduragimov, Adil R.; Narsinh, Kiran; Gasymov, Oktay K.; Glasgow, Ben J.",Mol Vis,97,28

Both proteins are presumably translated from a single subgenomic RNA. We have identified two translational strategies operating in pr12 gene expression. Internal initiation at the first and the second AUG codon of the pr12 coding sequence results in the synthesis of the 12K protein. In addition the protein is produced as a CP/12K transframe protein by ribosomal frameshifting. For these studies parts of the CP and pr12 coding sequences including the putative frameshift region were introduced into an internal position of the beta-glucuronidase gene. Mutational analyses in conjunction with in vitro translation experiments identified a homopolymeric string of four adenosine nucleotides which together with a 3' flanking UGA stop codon were required for efficient frameshifting. The signal AAAAUGA is the first frameshift signal with a shifty stop codon to be analyzed in the eukaryotic system. Substitution of the four consecutive adenosine nucleotides by UUUU increased the efficiency of frameshifting, while substitution by GGGG or CCCC dramatically reduced the synthesis of the transframe protein. Also, UAA and UAG could replace the opal stop codon without effect on the frameshifting event, but mutation of UGA to the sense codon UGG inhibited transframe protein formation. These findings suggest that the mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting at the PVM signal is different from the one described by the 'simultaneous slippage' model in that only the string of four adenosine nucleotides represents the slippery sequence involved in a -1 P-site slippage.","Gramstat, A; Prüfer, D; Rohde, W",,97,16

The 125,000-, 90,000-, and 15,000-molecular-weight methionine-labeled proteins were identified as virion surface glycoproteins by lactoperoxidase iodination and galactose oxidase-boro[3H]hydride reduction labeling techniques. Radioimmunoassay antibody titers to purified p28, the most abundant viral structural protein, averaged 1:182 in synovial fluid and 1:67 in serum 6 months after inoculation. High dilutions of serum and synovial fluid reacted with gp90 and gp125 electroblotted onto nitrocellulose paper from polyacrylamide gels. Anti-gp90 activity was detected at dilutions with an immunoglobulin G content of 0.02 to 11 micrograms, whereas antibody to p28, when detectable on Western blots, was present in samples with an immunoglobulin G content of 0.1 to 2 mg, representing 100- to 1,000-fold-greater titers of antibody to the surface glycoprotein. Synovial fluids often contained more anti-gp90 antibody than did sera. Immunoprecipitation of lactoperoxidase-iodinated virus confirmed the presence of high antibody titers to the two virion surface glycoproteins. Because antiviral gp90 and gp125 antibody is abundant in the synovial fluid of infected goats, it probably contributes to the high immunoglobulin G1 concentrations seen at this site 6 months after caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus infection.","Johnson, G C; Barbet, A F; Klevjer-Anderson, P; McGuire, T C",Infection and immunity,97,24

This study aimed to describe the profile of children presenting to a tertiary paediatric emergency department(ED) with CSA. METHODS Children 0-16 years old presenting to KK Women's and Children's Hospital ED from June 2016 to August 2020 with sexual abuse were retrospectively reviewed. We performed a secondary analysis on girls and stratified them by age <13 and ≥13 years old. RESULTS There were 790 patients who made 833 visits for CSA. Victims were predominantly girls (747, 94.8%) and perpetrators were predominantly men (763, 96.6%). The abuse first occurred before the age of 13 years in 315 victims (39.9%). For 468 (59.2%), more than one incident occurred before presentation. Compared to girls ≥13 years old, girls <13 years old were more frequently abused by a family member (47.7% versus 8.0%, P<0.001) and abused in their own home (55.7% vs 21.0%, P<0.001). Among all children, parental divorce and the absence of one or both biological parents in the household were prevalent, with 287/783 (36.7%) having divorced parents, and only 374/784 (47.8%) residing with both biological parents. CONCLUSION The findings highlight common characteristics of CSA cases, and can aid the future identification and protection of vulnerable children. The fact that most children presented after more than one incident suggests the need to more closely monitor and protect potentially at-risk children.","Lee, Magdalene H M; Ganapathy, Sashikumar; Low, Soo Mei; Chua, Christine L Q; Chong, Shu Ling; Ma, Eric; Wong, Peter C Y","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",97,1

In view of the potential of DNA vaccines to induce cell-mediated responses, their efficacy to induce protective immunity in cats was evaluated. The membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins were chosen as antigens, because antibodies to the spike (S) protein of FIP virus (FIPV) are known to precipitate pathogenesis. However, vaccination by repeated injections of plasmids encoding these proteins did not protect kittens against challenge infection with FIPV. Also, a prime-boost protocol failed to afford protection, with priming using plasmid DNA and boosting using recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the same coronavirus proteins. Because of the role of IL-12 in initiating cell-mediated immunity, the effects of co-delivery of plasmids encoding the feline cytokine were studied. Again, IL-12 did not meet expectations - on the contrary, it enhanced susceptibility to FIPV challenge. This study shows that DNA vaccination failed to protect cats against FIP and that IL-12 may yield adverse effects when used as a cytokine adjuvant.","Glansbeek, Harrie L; Haagmans, Bart L; te Lintelo, Eddie G; Egberink, Herman F; Duquesne, Véronique; Aubert, André; Horzinek, Marian C; Rottier, Peter J M",The Journal of general virology,97,30

Yet, pseudorabies virus (PRV) was established in feral swine in the United States, becoming a potential reservoir of PRV for infection of domestic swine and other native wildlife. A critical need for the current PRV surveillance program in the United States is the rapid detection of PRV infection. For this reason, a set of 2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays by using TaqMan chemistry was developed and evaluated for their capability in the detection and differentiation of field and vaccine strains of PRV. PCR primers and probes were designed for gB and gE genes of PRV, respectively. The newly developed PRV-specific real-time PCR assays could detect all wild-type PRV isolates from diagnostic submissions and differentiate them from vaccine strains. The analytical sensitivity of the assays was approximately 0.1 plaque-forming units per reaction. The assays were highly specific for PRV, because no positive results were obtained from testing other common swine viral pathogens and other animal herpesviruses. The results of testing samples from domestic and feral swine and from bovine showed that the real-time PCR assays are more sensitive than gel-based PCR. These results demonstrated the potential application of the developed real-time PCR assays as a differential test for rapid and specific detection of PRV in domestic and feral swine, as well as nonporcine species that can be infected with PRV and serve as carriers.","Ma, Wenjun; Lager, Kelly M; Richt, Juergen A; Stoffregen, William C; Zhou, Fanghong; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",97,1

The reasons for these differences are complex and incompletely understood. Our aim was to use a contemporary real-world national cohort of patients presenting with their first MI to better understand the extent to which differences in the clinical presentation, cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors, comorbidity and in-hospital treatment explain the mortality outcomes for Māori and Pacific peoples. METHODS New Zealand residents (≥20 years old) hospitalised with their first MI (2014-2017), and who underwent coronary angiography, were identified from the All New Zealand Acute Coronary Syndrome Quality Improvement (ANZACS-QI) registry. All-cause mortality up to one year after the index admission date was obtained by linkage to the national mortality database. RESULTS There were 17,404 patients with a first ever MI. European/other comprised 76% of the population, Māori 11.5%, Pacific 5.1%, Indian 4.3% and Other Asian 2.9%. Over half (55%) of Māori, Pacific and Indian patients were admitted with their first MI before age 60 years, compared with 29% of European/other patients. Māori and Pacific patients had a higher burden of traditional and non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and despite being younger, were more likely to present with heart failure and, together with Indian peoples, advanced coronary disease at presentation with first MI. After adjustment for age and sex, Māori and Pacific, but not Indian or Other Asian patients had significantly higher all-cause mortality at one year compared with the European/other reference group (HR 2.55 (95% CI 2.12-3.07), HR 2.98 (95% CI 2.34-3.81) for Māori and Pacific respectively). When further adjusted for differences in clinical presentation, clinical history and cardiovascular risk factors, the excess mortality risk for Māori and Pacific patients was reduced substantially, but a differential persisted (HR 1.77 (95% CI 1.44-2.19), HR 1.42 (95% CI 1.07-1.83)) which was not further reduced by adjustment for differences in in-hospital management and discharge medications. CONCLUSION In New Zealand patients after their first MI there is a three-fold variation in one-year mortality based on ethnicity. At least half of the inequity in outcomes for Māori, and three-quarters for Pacific people, is associated with differences in preventable or modifiable clinical factors present at, or prior to, presentation.","Mazengarb, Janine; Grey, Corina; Lee, Mildred; Poppe, Katrina; Mehta, Suneela; Harwood, Matire; Harrison, Wil; Earle, Nicki; Jackson, Rod; Kerr, Andrew",The New Zealand medical journal,97,19

Severe COVID-19 itself is a life-threatening disease and various factors, including diabetes, especially when complicated by ketoacidosis, previous respiratory pathology, immunosuppressive therapy, nosocomial infection sources and systemic immune alterations of COVID-19 itself predispose to mucormycosis. No specific biomarkers are available to diagnose mucormycosis; imaging of the involved area and histopathological examination of the biopsied tissue are most important in diagnosis. The underlying medical conditions must be corrected; these include good glycemic control, tapering of steroids, and reducing or stopping immunosuppressive medications. Systemic antifungal therapy with liposomal Amphotericin B is the medical treatment of choice though drug resistance is not uncommon. Surgical debridement of devitalized tissue is often required. Severe COVID-19 patients with secondary co-infections require longer hospitalization and had higher risks of death. The mortality rate is almost 50% despite timely adequate treatment. The judicious use of systemic glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents for treating severe disease and hyperglycemia control seems vital for preventing and managing mucormycosis.","Kamrul-Hasan, A B; Selim, S",Mymensingh medical journal : MMJ,97,9

MATERIAL AND METHODS Secondary analysis of the COVID-19 registry compiled by the emergency department of Hospital Clínico San Carlos in Madrid, Spain. We selected suspected COVID-19 cases treated in the emergency department between February 28 and March 31, 2020. The cases were grouped as follows: 1) suspected, no polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test (S/no-PCR); 2) suspected, negative PCR (S/PCR-); 3) suspected, positive PCR (S/PCR+); 4) highly suspected, no PCR, or negative PCR (HS/no or PCR-); and 5) highly suspected, positive PCR (HS/PCR+). We collected clinical, radiologic, and microbiologic data related to the emergency visit. The main outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were hospitalization and clinical severity of the episode. RESULTS A total of 1993 cases (90.9%) were included as follows: S/no-PCR, 17.2%; S/PCR-, 11.4%; S/PCR+, 22.1%; HS/no PCR or PCR-, 11.7%; and HS/PCR+, 37.6%. Short-term outcomes differed significantly in the different groups according to demographic characteristics; comorbidity and clinical, radiographic, analytical, and therapeutic variables. Thirty-day mortality was 11.5% (56.5% in hospitalized cases and 19.6% in cases classified as severe). The 2 HS categories and the S/PCR+ category had a greater adjusted risk for 30-day mortality and for having a clinically severe episode during hospitalization in comparison with S/PCR- cases. Only the 2 HS categories showed greater risk for hospitalization than the S/PCR- cases. CONCLUSION COVID-19 diagnostic groups differ according to clinical and laboratory characteristics, and the differences are associated with the 30-day prognosis.","Martín-Sánchez, F Javier; González Del Castillo, Juan; Valls Carbó, Adrián; López Picado, Amanda; Martínez-Valero, Carmen; D Miranda, Juande; Chacón, Ana; López-Ayala, Pedro; Chaparro, David; Cozar López, Gabriel; Suárez-Cadenas, María Del Mar; Jerez Fernández, Pablo; Del Toro, Enrique; Cardassay, Eduardo; Angós, Beatriz; Díaz Del Arco, Cristina; Rodríguez Adrada, Esther; Montalvo Moraleda, María Teresa; Espejo Paeres, Carolina; Elvira, Carlos; García Briñón, Miguel Ángel; Leal Pozuelo, José Mª; Ortega, Luis; Fernández Pérez, Cristina; González Armengol, Juan Jorge",Emergencias : revista de la Sociedad Espanola de Medicina de Emergencias,97,1

METHODS The clinical data of 48 patients with suspected COVID-19 admitted in Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital from January 21, 2020 to March 20, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS In the 48 suspected cases, 18 were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 30 were excluded. Each of the confirmed cases were discussed among MDT for 2 to 12 times with an average of (4.7±3.2) times; while for non-COVID-19 patients were discussed for 2 to 4 times with an average of (2.3±0.6) times. With the guidance of MDT, one COVID-19 patient was transferred to designated provincial hospital after effective treatment; one patient complicated with acute cholecystitis underwent gallbladder puncture and drainage; and COVID-19 was excluded in a highly suspected patient after alveolar lavage fluid examination. Except one transferred patient, all 17 confirmed COVID-19 patients were cured and discharged. There was no cross-infection occurred in suspected patients during the hospitalization. There were no deaths and no medical staff infections. CONCLUSIONS The efficiency of diagnosis and treatment for suspected COVID-19 patients can be improved with MDT, particularly for complicated cases.","Ding, Shubo; Yu, Shi'an; Chen, Haijun; Zhang, Dehe; Xu, Yejin; Zhu, Dan; Cheng, Kun",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

MATERIAL AND METHODS This clinical retrospective study included 103 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. All patient data were obtained from the patient files and anesthesia follow-up forms. Demographic datas, intraoperative fluids, blood products requirement and blood gas parameters were recorded. RESULTS A total 15 of 103 patients data were lack, the remaining 88 patients were evaluated. Combination of crystalloid and colloid was used for intravenous fluid management. About 11% of patients required transfusion during surgery. The mean pH and pO2 values of the patients were observed to decrease whereas pCO2 and lactate values increased. DISCUSSION Radical Prostatectomy can be performed either using open technique as a traditional approach or laparoscopic or robot-assisted technique as a minimally invasive approach. Today, minimally invasive approaches have replaced traditional open prostatectomy. Anaesthesia management of these minimally invasive techniques is very different and challenging from open technique in many aspects. CONCLUSION Although minimally invasive techniques have good surgical outcomes such as less blood loss, smaller surgical incision, and shorter hospitalization, these techniques bring new problems that anesthesiologists have to deal with. Increased RARP operations has led to the anesthesiologists more likely to encounter perioperative problems.

These governmental actions led to changes in everyday life, implementation of new rules, and reduced access to healthcare. Hospital beds were reserved for emergency use, face-to-face ambulatory care was mainly replaced by telemedicine. In our study we assessed opinion of the patients in two outpatient psychiatric care units in Budapest regarding the state of emergency. METHODS We enrolled 438 patients in the survey (305 women and 133 men, mean age: 51.9±16.2 years). The patients completed a short questionnaire on a voluntary and anonymous basis following verbal informed consent. The questionnaire was comprised of 10 items and a 12-item ""Problem Evaluation Scale"" (fear, isolation and healthcare subscales). The comparison of groups was done using general linear models (GLM), pairwise comparison was performed using Tukey's test for post hoc analysis. The data set was analyzed with SPSS software, version 24.0. RESULTS Up to 34% of enrolled patients believed that their condition worsened during the state of emergency, but 12% of these patients thought that this worsening was not related to the state of emergency. Twice as many patients (12.8%) were concerned about their financial situation than about their health status (6.1%). Loneliness and the implementation of specific regulations didn't cause relevant distress in almost half of the patients, isolation was the most frequently (55.2%) reported difficulty. The worsening of health status was reported more frequently (p=0.001) by the patients younger than 50 years, the sensation of fear was stronger (p=0.045), and they reported more serious adaptation difficulties (p=0.003) than subjects older than 50 years. Isolation caused significantly (p=0.003) more serious distress among women. The abundance of pandemic-related information caused more distress in the case of patients treated for anxiety than participants treated for psychotic disorders (p=0.024). Patients suffering from affective disorders perceived more pronounced feelings of vulnerability compared to patients treated for psychotic disorders (p=0.004). CONCLUSION Approximately half of the enrolled psychiatric patients was able to adapt to this situation without major difficulties, the other half of this sample was more or less distressed by these circumstances. Unfortunately, depletion of emotional, psychological, social and material resources can be expected during the next stage of the pandemic. As a result, we can expect further worsening of the above presented aspects.","Pogany, Laszlo; Horvath, Andras Aron; Slezak, Adrienne; Rozsavolgyi, Eva; Lazary, Judit",Neuropsychopharmacologia Hungarica : a Magyar Pszichofarmakologiai Egyesulet lapja = official journal of the Hungarian Association of Psychopharmacology,97,33

Conventional pre-clinical training employed the use of cadavers, but financial, ethical and supervisory constraints have become a major shortcoming. With the adaptation of technology in dentistry, pre-clinical training has now employed simulation. It provides the opportunity for students to develop psychomotor skills for procedures by practising pre-clinical, standardised learning competencies before they engage in patient-management. Simulation involves computer-aided learning, augmented reality and virtual reality, which are largely taking over pre-clinical teaching. Augmented reality is commonly being employed in maxillofacial, restorative, tooth morphology learning and mastering technique for administering local anaesthesia in dentistry. Virtual reality is being employed particularly in pre-treatment implant planning and dental education for students. Use of haptic technology, like robotics, is also gaining popularity, and facilitates a two-way communication between the user and the environment to better simulate the clinical setting for learning purposes.","Haji, Zainab; Arif, Aysha; Jamal, Shizrah; Ghafoor, Robia",JPMA.

METHODS We conducted a cohort study of healthy Melbourne children, aged from 12 to 71 months. Parents kept a daily respiratory symptom diary and recorded resource use when an influenza-like illness (ILI) occurred. RESULTS One-hundred and eighteen children had 137 ILI episodes over 12 weeks for a rate of 0.53 ILI episodes per child-month (95% CI 0.44-0.61). Risk factors for ILI included younger age, fewer people residing in the household, structured exposure to other children outside the home, and a higher household income. Episodes had a mean duration of 10.4 days with 64 visits to a general practitioner (46.7 GP visits per 100 episodes), 27 antibiotic courses prescribed (19.7 antibiotic courses per 100 episodes), and three overnight hospitalizations (2.2 admissions per 100 episodes). Parents reported an average of 11.7 h excess time spent caring for a child per episode. CONCLUSIONS Respiratory illnesses are a common and largely neglected cause of illness in Australian children.

The WURSS-21 is a widely used questionnaire instrument that assesses symptom severity and functional impact of common cold and flu-like illness. METHODS This study applies item response theory, specifically Rasch modeling, to investigate dimensional and measurement properties of the WURSS-21, and looks at invariance over time. The data assessed represents 1167 people, each scoring the WURSS-21 once daily for up to seven consecutive days of acute upper respiratory infection (URI) illness. RESULTS Rasch analysis supports a single domain WURSS-21 global symptom score. Assessment of differential item functioning across seven days of illness provides evidence for measurement invariance. While individual items rating physical symptoms were somewhat variable, items rating functional impairment and quality of life impact appeared quite consistent across a single domain over seven days of illness. CONCLUSION Rasch analysis of WURSS-21 items provides evidential support for a single invariant domain. These findings support the practice of using a simply summed daily global illness severity score to represent the overall symptomatic and functional impairments arising from URI.","Brown, Roger L; Obasi, Chidi N; Barrett, Bruce","Journal of lung, pulmonary & respiratory research",97,33

Using previous specific trade trends, the authors modelled expected trade flows and compared observed imports with expected imports to calculate the potential cost of lost trade. The conclusion of this analysis was that the impact of European restrictions on fish exports from Mozambique, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda on the economies of these African countries was at least US dollar 332,217,415 for the years 1998 to 2002.

The TGEV M protein adopts two topologies in the virus envelope, a Nexo-Cendo topology (with the amino terminus exposed to the virus surface and the carboxy terminus inside the virus particle) and a Nexo-Cexo topology (with both the amino and carboxy termini exposed to the virion surface). The existence of a population of M molecules adopting a Nexo-Cexo topology in the virion envelope was demonstrated by (i) immunopurification of (35)S-labeled TGEV virions using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the M protein carboxy terminus (this immunopurification was inhibited only by deletion mutant M proteins that maintained an intact carboxy terminus), (ii) direct binding of M-specific MAbs to the virus surface, and (iii) mass spectrometry analysis of peptides released from trypsin-treated virions. Two-thirds of the total number of M protein molecules found in the virion were associated with the cores, and one-third was lost during core purification. MAbs specific for the M protein carboxy terminus were bound to native virions through the M protein in a Nexo-Cexo conformation, and these molecules were removed when the virus envelope was disrupted with NP-40 during virus core purification. All of the M protein was susceptible to N-glycosidase F treatment of the native virions, which indicates that all the M protein molecules are exposed to the virus surface. Cores purified from glycosidase-treated virions included M protein molecules that completely or partially lost the carbohydrate moiety, which strongly suggests that the M protein found in the cores was also exposed in the virus envelope and was not present exclusively in the virus interior. A TGEV virion structure integrating all the data is proposed. According to this working model, the TGEV virion consists of an internal core, made of the nucleocapsid and the carboxy terminus of the M protein, and the envelope, containing the spike (S) protein, the envelope (E) protein, and the M protein in two conformations. The two-thirds of the molecules that are in a Nexo-Cendo conformation (with their carboxy termini embedded within the virus core) interact with the internal core, and the remaining third of the molecules, whose carboxy termini are in a Nexo-Cexo conformation, are lost during virus core purification.","Escors, D; Camafeita, E; Ortego, J; Laude, H; Enjuanes, L",Journal of virology,97,28

Using ELISA, we demonstrated that 12 of 12 herds in Saskatchewan, and 109 of 110 animals tested, and antibody to bovine coronavirus. There was no elevated antibody response in serum or lacteal secretions of cows vaccinated once or twice with a commercially available modified live rota-coronavirus vaccine.

METHODS Nasal and throat swab samples were collected in 843 children with lower respiratory tract infection. The multiple RT-PCR method was used to detect HBoV and six other common respiratory tract viruses. The clinical characteristics of HboV positive cases were investigated. RESULTS Among 843 cases, 90 were HboV positive (10.7%), 131 were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) positive (15.5%), 117 were influenza virus positive (13.9%), 84 were parainfluenza virus positive (10.0%), 55 were rhinovirus positive (6.5%), 48 were coronavirus positive (5.7%), and 33 were human metapneumovirus positive (3.7%). Of the 90 HBoV infected patients, 45 (50%) showed a co-infection with other respiratory tract viruses. Among them, 33 were infected with one other type of virus (37%), 11 (12%) were infected with two other types of virus, and 1 case (1%) was infected with other three viruses. The HBoV positive rate in children with wheezing was significantly higher than those without wheezing (17.0% vs 9.2%; P<0.01). The common clinical manifestations of HBoV-infected patients included frequent coughing, wheezing and fever. There were no significant differences in the frequency of wheezing between HBoV and RSV infected patients. CONCLUSIONS HBoV positive rate detected from children with wheezing is higher than from children without wheezing, suggesting that apart from RSV, HBoV is another virus causing wheezing in children with respiratory tract infection. Co-infections of HBoV with other respiratory track viruses can be present in some patients.","Yan, Hua-Jie; Sheng, Jun; Dong, Wei; Shao, Jie",Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,97,4

Delirium has been associated with morbidity and mortality including more ventilator days, longer ICU stay, increased long-term mortality and cognitive impairment. Thus, the burden of delirium for patients, relatives and societies is considerable. Today, reviews of randomised clinical trials are produced in large scales sometimes making it difficult to get an overview of the available evidence. A preliminary search identified several reviews investigating the effects of pharmacological interventions for the management and prevention of delirium in ICU patients. The conclusions of the reviews showed conflicting results. Despite this unclear evidence, antipsychotics, in particular, haloperidol is often the recommended pharmacological intervention for delirium in ICU patients. The objective of this overview of reviews is to critically assess the evidence of reviews of randomised clinical trials on the effect of pharmacological management and prevention of delirium in ICU patients. METHODS/DESIGN We will search for reviews in the following databases: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, BIOSIS, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, and Allied and Complementary Medicine Database. Two authors will independently select references for inclusion using Covidence, extract data and assess the methodological quality of the included systematic reviews using the ROBIS tool. Any disagreement will be resolved by consensus. We will present the data as a narrative synthesis and summarise the main results of the included reviews. In addition, we will present an overview of the bias risk assessment of the systematic reviews. DISCUSSION Results of this overview may establish a way forward to find and update or to design a high quality systematic review assessing the effects of the most promising pharmacological intervention for delirium in ICU patients.

The concentrations of SP and CGRP in the nasal mucosa were assessed with immunohistochemistry, and their prohormonal transcripts in the trigeminal ganglion were assessed with Northern blot. Mucosa was also processed for light microscopy and electron microscopy. SP-like immunoreactivity was greater in the nasal mucosa of infected animals than in uninfected controls. CGRP-like immunoreactivity was greater in the nasal septum, but not in the nasal turbinate, of infected than uninfected animals. In contrast, no change was evident in the expression levels of the prohormonal transcripts in the trigeminal ganglion. Infected nasal and tracheal mucosa was oedematous and locally infiltrated with inflammatory cells. In the nose of uninfected GF rats, subepithelial lymphoid aggregations were scarce and appeared inactive. We conclude that Mycoplasma pulmonis infection results in increased immunoreactivity of substance P, probably within nerves. There was no clear evidence of increased synthesis of the precursors of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide.","Norlander, T; Nilsson, L; Rivero, C; Midvedt, T; Lidegran, M; Carlsöö, B; Stierna, P",The European respiratory journal,97,8

Thirteen volunteers were clinically infected, 8 had sub-clinical infections and 3 were uninfected. Nasal airway resistance and the temperature of the nasal mucosa increased in all infected subjects both with and without symptoms: the core temperature increased also but to a lesser extent. Mucosal blood flow and nasal secretion increased only in those with symptoms. The albumin content of the nasal secretion increased in the clinically infected, suggesting that it was derived, partially at least, from the circulation. The nasal cycle of variation in airway resistance between the two sides of the nose was observed in all three groups but increased only in those clinically infected.","Bende, M; Barrow, I; Heptonstall, J; Higgins, P G; Al-Nakib, W; Tyrrell, D A; Akerlund, A",Acta oto-laryngologica,97,4

Primary threats to the survival of free-ranging maned wolves include habitat loss, road kills, and shooting by farmers. An additional threat to the conservation of maned wolves is the risk of morbidity and mortality due to infectious and parasitic diseases. Captive maned wolves are susceptible to, and die from, common infectious diseases of domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) including canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus (CPV), rabies virus, and canine adenovirus (CAV). Results from this study show that free-ranging maned wolves in a remote area of Bolivia have been exposed to multiple infectious and parasitic agents of domestic carnivores, including CAV, CDV, CPV, canine coronavirus, rabies virus, Leptospira interrogans spp., Toxoplasma gondii, and Dirofilaria immitis, and may be at increased risk for disease due to these agents.","Deem, Sharon L; Emmons, Louise H",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,97,17

Build on the experience in Argentine hemorrhagic fever with convalescent plasma, we incorporated 90 patients with COVID-19, of which 87 were evaluable, into a multicenter study. We collected 397 plasma donations from 278 convalescent donors. Patients received plasma with an IgG concentration of 0.7-0.8 (measured by Abbott chemiluminescence) for every 10 kg of body weight. Survival during the first 28 days was the primary objective; 77% were male, age 54 ± 15.6 y/o (range 27-85), body mass index 29.7 ± 4.4; hypertension 39% and diabetes 20.7%; 19.5% had an immunosuppressive condition, 23% were health workers.

For each mutation, cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cell lines containing 0 or 100% mutated mtDNAs were isolated and their genetic, biochemical, and morphological characteristics were examined. Both mutations resulted in the same biochemical and molecular genetic phenotypes. Specifically, cybrids containing 100% mutated mtDNAs, but not those containing the corresponding wild-type mtDNAs, exhibited severe defects in respiratory chain activity, in the rates of protein synthesis, and in the steady-state levels of mitochondrial translation products. In addition, aberrant mitochondrial translation products were detected with both mutations. No significant alterations were observed in the processing of polycistronic RNA precursor transcripts derived from the region containing the tRNA(Lys) gene. These results demonstrate that two different mtDNA mutations in tRNA(Lys), both associated with the same mitochondrial disorder, result in fundamentally identical defects at the cellular level and strongly suggest that specific protein synthesis abnormalities contribute to the pathogenesis of myoclonus epilepsy with ragged-red fibers.","Masucci, J P; Davidson, M; Koga, Y; Schon, E A; King, M P",Molecular and cellular biology,97,25

Both secondary contamination during chemical disasters and hospital-associated infections during epidemic illness can pose substantial threats to achieving this goal. Understanding basic principles of decontamination and infection control during responses to chemical and biologic disasters can help minimize the risks to patients and health care workers. Effective decontamination following toxic chemical exposure should include both removal of contaminated clothing and decontamination of the victim's skin. Wet decontamination is the most feasible strategy in a mass casualty situation and should be performed promptly by trained personnel. In the event of an epidemic, infection prevention and control measures are based on essential principles of hand hygiene and standard precautions. Expanded precautions should be instituted as needed to target contact, droplet, and airborne routes of infectious disease transmission. Specific equipment and measures for critical care delivery may serve to decrease risk to health care workers in the event of an epidemic.

Thus, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is an attractive target for the development of anticancer therapeutics. In this study, we identified hexachlorophene as an inhibitor of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling from cell-based small-molecule screening. Hexachlorophene antagonized CRT that was stimulated by Wnt3a-conditioned medium by promoting the degradation of beta-catenin. This degradation pathway is Siah-1 and adenomatous polyposis colidependent, but glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and F-box beta-transducin repeat-containing protein-independent. In addition, hexachlorophene represses the expression of cyclin D1, which is a known beta-catenin target gene, and inhibits the growth of colon cancer cells. Our findings suggest that hexachlorophene attenuates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling through the Siah-1-mediated beta-catenin degradation.","Park, Seoyoung; Gwak, Jungsug; Cho, Munju; Song, Taeyun; Won, Jaejoon; Kim, Dong-Eun; Shin, Jae-Gook; Oh, Sangtaek",Molecular pharmacology,97,19

Major group human rhinovirus enters cells by binding to the cell surface molecule ICAM-1 that is present on epithelial and monocytic lineage cells. The focus of the resulting viral infection is in bronchial epithelia. However, previous studies of the cytokine dysregulation that follows rhinovirus infection have implicated monocytic lineage cells in establishing the inflammatory environment even though productive infection is not a result. We have determined that human alveolar macrophages and human peripheral blood monocytes release MCP-1 upon exposure to human rhinovirus 16 (HRV16). Indeed, we have found p38 MAPK activation in human alveolar macrophages within 15 min of exposure to HRV16, and this activation lasts up to 1 h. The targets of p38 MAPK activation include transcriptional activators of the MCP-1 promoter. The transcription factor ATF-2, a p38 MAPK substrate, is phosphorylated 45 min after HRV16 exposure. Furthermore, IkappaBalpha, the inhibitor of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, is degraded. Prevention of HRV16 binding was effective in blocking p38 MAPK activation, ATF-2 phosphorylation, and MCP-1 release. This is the first report of a relationship between HRV16 exposure, MCP-1 release and monocytic-lineage cells suggesting that MCP-1 plays a role in establishing the inflammatory microenvironment initiated in the human airway upon exposure to rhinovirus.","Hall, David J; Bates, Mary Ellen; Guar, Lasya; Cronan, Mark; Korpi, Nichole; Bertics, Paul J",Journal of immunology,97,12

The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) plays a key role in shaping opinion and endoscopy activity throughout Europe and further afield. Establishing key unanswered questions within the field of endoscopy and prioritizing those that are important enables researchers and funders to appropriately allocate resources. Methods: Over 2 years, the ESGE Research Committee gathered information on research priorities and refined them through a modified Delphi approach. Consultations were held with the ESGE Governing Board and Quality Improvement Committee to identify important unanswered questions. Research workshops were held at the 21st United European Gastroenterology Week. Research questions were refined by the ESGE Research Committee and Governing Board, compiled into an online survey, and distributed to all ESGE members, who were invited to rank each question by priority. Results: The final questionnaire yielded 291 responses from over 60 countries. The three countries with the highest response rates were Spain, Italy, and United Kingdom. Most responders were from teaching hospitals (62 %) and were specialist endoscopists (51 %). Responses were analyzed with weighted rankings, resulting in prioritization of 26 key unanswered questions. The top ranked generic questions were: 1) How do we define the correct surveillance interval following endoscopic diagnosis? 2) How do we correctly utilize advanced endoscopic imaging? 3) What are the best markers of endoscopy quality? Conclusion: Following this comprehensive process, the ESGE has identified and ranked the key unanswered questions within the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy. Researchers, funders, and journals should prioritize studies that seek to answer these important questions.","Rees, Colin J; Ngu, Wee Sing; Regula, Jaroslaw; Bisschops, Raf; Saftoiu, Adrian; Dekker, Evelien; Gralnek, Ian; Ciocirlan, Mihai; Dinis-Ribeiro, Mario; Jover, Rodrigo; Meisner, Søren; Spada, Cristiano; Hassan, Cesare; Valori, Roland; Hucl, Tomas; Le Moine, Olivier; Domagk, Dirk; Kaminski, Michal F; Bretthauer, Michael; Rutter, Matthew D; Aabakken, Lars; Ponchon, Thierry; Fockens, Paul; Siersema, Peter D",Endoscopy,97,1

It is widely known that the consequences of most of such diseases include temporary or permanent loss of working ability and continuous significant investments of money in the prediction, curing, and rehabilitation measures. The increase in the number of individuals with deviant behavior, especially among teenagers and young people, social disadaptation, migration of people, insufficient government funding for healthcare and social sphere concerning prevention of diseases of social significance and diseases linked with social status - all these factors create the background for the further complication of the STIs epidemic situation in Ukraine. It is scientifically proven that raising the quality of help given people with STIs and increasing its accessibility for different social strata, particularly for the representatives of the target groups, is an effective method for decreasing the rate of parenteral hepatitis and HIV infections in society. The aim of the current research is to assess the quality of the specialized help given patients with STIs (on the example of HIV-infected persons) in order to implement the integrated system of medical and social rehabilitation considering the features of the target group. The survey was conducted on the basis of designed questionnaires which included questions regarding the level of education, social status, necessity and frequency of appeals for medical help, particularly for dermatovenereological help, the affordability and comprehensiveness of the latter, the level of satisfaction with the received medical care, the respondent's assessment of quality and modernity of medical equipment. 389 questionaries' served as material for the research. Each questionnaire was composed of 15 questions. The respondents included 201 males and 188 females diagnosed with HIV-infection, who permanently live in Odessa region. Methods of research: analytical, descriptive, and statistical. The majority of HIV-infected respondents received incomplete secondary, complete secondary or vocational secondary education, 10,28% of them (40 respondents) received incomplete or complete higher education, which characterized the cohort of respondents as people with low level of education, social and sexual awareness. 24,16% of respondents (94 persons) were permanently employed; the others - were unemployed due to different reasons, and, consequently, had low social security level.

Data on attendances, discharge against medical advice, triage categories, trauma and ambulance cases were retrieved from the computer and compared with the data in the same periods in 2002. RESULTS In the first period, when compared with 2002 there was a significant decrease in the mean daily attendance (397 vs 524), trauma cases (68 vs 111), minor cases (category 4: 283 vs 361, and category 5: 20 vs 43). In the second period, there was a significant decrease in the mean daily attendance (265 vs 545), trauma cases (40 vs 111), minor cases (category 4:181 vs 376, and category 5: 12 vs 45), discharge against medical advice (4 vs 6 daily) and ambulance cases (70 vs 86 daily). Patients requiring immediate care however, remained similar. CONCLUSION There was a significant drop in the overall ED attendance, trauma cases and minor cases after the outbreak of SARS.

A complete cDNA clone of MHV DI RNA containing an inserted intergenic region, derived from the area of genomic RNA between genes 6 and 7, was constructed. After transfection of the in vitro-synthesized DI RNA into MHV-infected cells, replication of genomic DI RNA as well as transcription of the subgenomic DI RNA was observed. S1 nuclease protection experiments, sequence analysis, and Northern (RNA) blotting analysis revealed that the subgenomic DI RNA contained the leader sequence at its 5' end and that the body of the subgenomic DI RNA started from the inserted intergenic sequence. Two subgenomic DI RNAs were synthesized after inserting two intergenic sites into the MHV DI RNA. Metabolic labeling of virus-specific protein in DI RNA replicating cells demonstrated that a protein was translated from the subgenomic DI RNA, which can therefore be considered a functional mRNA. Transfection study of gel-purified genomic DI RNA and subgenomic DI RNA revealed that the introduction of the genomic DI RNA, but not subgenomic DI RNA, into MHV-infected cells was required for synthesis of the subgenomic DI RNA. A series of deletion mutations in the intergenic site demonstrated that the sequence flanking the consensus sequence of UCUAAAC affected the efficiency of subgenomic DI RNA transcription and that the consensus sequence was necessary but not sufficient for the synthesis of the subgenomic DI RNA.","Makino, S; Joo, M; Makino, J K",Journal of virology,97,28

Its N terminus contains two stretches of highly conserved hydrophobic amino acids (residues 260-266 and 276-298) that have been proposed as N-terminal or internal fusion peptide segments (N-FPS, I-FPS) by analogy with similar sequences of other viral glycoproteins or based on experimental data obtained with synthetic peptides, respectively. By using a pH-dependent, recombinant LASV glycoprotein mediated cell-cell fusion assay and a retroviral pseudotype infectivity assay, an alanine scan of all hydrophobic amino acids within both proposed FPSs was performed. Fusogenicity and infectivity were correlated, both requiring correct processing of the glycoprotein precursor. Most point mutations in either FPS accounted for reduced or abolished fusion or infection, respectively. Some mutations also had an effect on pre-fusion steps of virus entry, possibly by inducing structural changes in the glycoprotein. The data demonstrate that several amino acids from both hydrophobic regions of the N terminus, some of which (W264, G277, Y278 and L280) are 100 % conserved in all arenaviruses, are involved in fusogenicity and infectivity of LASV GP-2.","Klewitz, Christian; Klenk, Hans-Dieter; ter Meulen, Jan",The Journal of general virology,97,7

Other New World hantaviruses, such as Prospect Hill virus (PHV), have not been associated with human disease. Activation of an antiviral state and cell signaling in response to hantavirus infection were examined using human primary lung endothelial cells, the main target cell infected in HPS patients. PHV, but not ANDV, was found to induce a robust beta interferon (IFN-beta) response early after infection of primary lung endothelial cells. The level of IFN induction correlated with IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) activation, in that IRF-3 dimerization and nuclear translocation were detected in PHV but not ANDV infection. In addition, phosphorylated Stat-1/2 levels were significantly lower in the ANDV-infected cells relative to PHV. Presumably, this reflects the lower level of IRF-3 activation and initial IFN induced by ANDV relative to PHV. To determine whether, in addition, ANDV interference with IFN signaling also contributed to the low Stat-1/2 activation seen in ANDV infection, the levels of exogenous IFN-beta-induced Stat-1/2 activation detectable in uninfected versus ANDV- or PHV-infected Vero-E6 cells were examined. Surprisingly, both viruses were found to downregulate IFN-induced Stat-1/2 activation. Analysis of cells transiently expressing only ANDV or PHV glycoproteins implicated these proteins in this downregulation. In conclusion, while both viruses can interfere with IFN signaling, there is a major difference in the initial interferon induction via IRF-3 activation between ANDV and PHV in infected primary endothelial cells, and this correlates with the reported differences in pathogenicity of these viruses.","Spiropoulou, Christina F; Albariño, César G; Ksiazek, Thomas G; Rollin, Pierre E",Journal of virology,97,9

Examining the level of this cytokine along with other related factors can help to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease. In this cross-sectional study, 48 patients with COVID-19 whose disease was confirmed by swap testing were evaluated. The demographic information of the individuals, the symptoms of the disease, and the ward in which they were admitted were recorded. Blood samples were taken from patients to test for interleukin-6 levels by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA, Roche Diagnostics). Due to the lack of specific treatment protocols for patients and the use of supportive treatments based on meeting the nutritional needs for all patients, blood albumin levels and nutritional status of patients were also evaluated using Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) Form. Their calorie intake was assessed by calculating the number of calories received based on the type of nutrition and compared to the required amount calculated through the Harris-Benedict equation. 48 laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infected patients were included in the study with the mean age of 46.4 ± 8.3 years. 21 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). There was no significant difference between the ICU admitted and patients admitted inward in terms of demographic characteristics, and history of previous diseases (p > 0.05).

This review discusses the historical origins of these ideas, which began with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and spread from their origins in malaria research to other fields. As well the more established proinflammatory mediators, such as TNF, interleukin-1, and lymphotoxin, the roles of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, which are chiefly inhibitory, are discussed. The established and potential roles of two more recently recognized contributors, overactivity of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and the escape of high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1) protein from its normal location into the circulation, are also put in context. The pathogenesis of the disease caused by falciparum malaria is then considered in the light of what has been learned about the roles of these mediators in these other diseases, as well as in malaria itself.","Clark, Ian A; Alleva, Lisa M; Mills, Alison C; Cowden, William B",Clinical microbiology reviews,97,9

Here, we characterized the macro domains from hepatitis E virus, Semliki Forest virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV macro domain was determined at 1.8-Angstroms resolution in complex with ADP-ribose. Information derived from structural, mutational, and sequence analyses suggests a close phylogenetic and, most probably, functional relationship between viral and cellular macro domain homologs. The data revealed that viral macro domains have relatively poor ADP-ribose 1""-phosphohydrolase activities (which were previously proposed to be their biologically relevant function) but bind efficiently free and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1-bound poly(ADP-ribose) in vitro.

This is based on the findings that apoptogenic mutants of insect viruses cannot grow because infected host cells die by apoptosis. This suggests that the apoptotic response of host cells has a deleterious effect on virus infection. Thus, apoptosis is an important host defense mechanism that is capable of inhibiting viral replication during infection. However, in vitro studies indicated that apoptosis alone does not provide the same protection against viral infection in animal cells as it does in the insect cells. Still, most animal viruses have acquired a strategy to overcome host cell apoptosis. In addition, a varying degree of necrosis usually accompanies apoptosis, suggesting a possible contribution of necrosis to the host reactions against virus. To understand the physiological significance of apoptosis during animal virus infection, we have characterized viral growth and the cellular responses against virus infection in a wide variety of virus-cell interaction systems. Mainly based on our own works, we discuss the nature of apoptosis in the animal virus infection and verify its role as a host defense mechanism against virus infection.","Koyama, A Hajime; Adachi, Akio; Irie, Hiroshi",International reviews of immunology,97,9

The incidence rate of SARS was 18.0/100,000 with case fatality rate as 6.7% in Haidian district, Beijing. Seventy-four percent of patients were adults with higher risk in age group of 20 - 29 year. SARS patients were scattered around in 32 out of 33 streets and villages in this district. The disease appeared to be sporadic but the case of outbreaks in family or university only seen in three streets. The course of SARS epidemic in this district could be divided into three phases: initial-which last for days, peak-21 days and then rapid decline-for 26 days. Number of patients having had a history of close contact to other SARS were gradually decreasing along with the process of the epidemics (trend chi(2) = 8.800, P = 0.003). Seventy-two point seven percent of the SARS cases had been exposed to the injection in the hospital settings. When the epidemics came to a rapid decline, 85.7% of the patients diagnosed during that period could be traced down to have had the history of contacting SARS cases within their own families. The distribution of occupation was also showed significantly different in the three respective stages (chi(2) = 36.41, P < 0.01).

The main focus is on height and weight. However, since weight is height-dependent, body mass index (BMI) is the best surrogate measurement of adiposity. Israel has not developed national growth tables; therefore, researchers and clinicians utilize either World Health Organization (WHO) or U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tables as benchmarks. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the anthropometrics of Israeli children benchmarked by CDC and WHO tables. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of the 1987-2003 birth cohort (age 4-18 years) from Clalit Health Services databases. Anthropometrics were retrieved twice: at study entry and one year later. We evaluated them as separate cohorts. Gender-specific age-matched median height and BMI were compared with CDC and WHO height and BMI tables. RESULTS he study consisted of 15,650, mean age at study entry 9.5 years (range 4-18). Gender-specific median heights of the Israeli children were similar to CDC and WHO values at younger ages, but were slightly shorter than the age-matched CDC and WHO toward the age of final height in both cohorts. However, gender-specific median BMI was considerably and statistically significant higher compared to CDC and WHO values consistently along the entire age range in both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS Israeli children were slightly shorter toward the age of final height, compared to WHO and CDC. However, BMI in Israeli children was significantly higher compared to the CDC and WHO consistently along the age range, which raises an alarm regarding obesity patterns.","Gabbay, Uri; Carmi, Doron; Mimouni-Blich, Aviva; Goldstein, Bat El; Keinan-Boker, Lital; Meyerovitch, Joseph",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,97,1

The aforementioned coronavirus affected 188 countries as of 8.10.2020. Despite the continually increasing number of COVID-19 cases reported to CDC, at national level, the percentage of visits to outpatient providers and emergency departments has decreased and mortality rates attributed to COVID-19 have declined compared to the previous weeks, still above the baseline. It is common knowledge that the coronavirus pandemic has reshaped societies and economies around the globe, affecting all aspects of everyday life. Public health systems as a whole have been globally affected since they had to face extraordinary demands over a long period of time, which, in turn, required rapid adjustments in the operating procedures that were already in use, in order to provide high-standard health services, while respecting patients quality of life. Over half of deaths in low-income countries are caused by communicable diseases, maternal causes, conditions arising during pregnancy and childbirth, and nutritional deficiencies. On the contrary, this percentage is less than 7% in high-income countries. Noncommunicable diseases cause 71% of deaths globally, ranging from 37% in low-income countries to 88% in high-income countries. However, in terms of absolute number of deaths, 78% of global NCD deaths occurred in low-and middle-income countries. This partially explains why recent developments in medicine were mostly focused on chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and type 2 diabetes, rather than focusing on infection and inflammation progress. The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent burden it placed upon health systems to deal with infectious and non-infectious diseases in a poor environment, can become an opportunity to update the field of medical research and change the governmental policies in place that have been stagnant and/or inefficient and ill-managed. This way, health systems will be equipped with better and faster protocols and best practices in order to manage efficiently any other pandemic that might emerge in the future.

A detailed pulse-chase analysis was made of the addition of O-linked sugars to the M protein; upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, three different electrophoretic forms could be distinguished that corresponded to the sequential acquisition of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), galactose (Gal), and sialic acid (SA). A fourth and fifth form could also be detected which we were unable to identify. Following Brefeldin A treatment, the M protein still acquired GalNAc, Gal, and SA, but the fourth and fifth forms were absent, suggesting that these modifications occur in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). In contrast, in the presence of BFA, the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which contains N-linked oligosaccharides, acquired Gal and fucose but not SA. These results are consistent with earlier published data showing that Golgi compartments proximal to the TGN, but not the TGN itself, relocate to the endoplasmatic reticulum/intermediate compartment. More importantly, our data argue that, whereas addition of SA to N-linked sugars occurs in the TGN the acquisition of both SA on O-linked sugars and the addition of fucose to N-linked oligosaccharides must occur in Golgi compartments proximal to the TGN. The glycosylation of the M protein moreover indicates that it is transported to trans-Golgi and TGN.

It has previously been shown that the N-terminal portion of this gene product is cleaved into a protein of 28 kilodaltons (p28). To further understand the mechanism of synthesis of the p28 protein, cDNA clones representing the 5'-most 5.3 kilobases of murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM were sequenced and subcloned into pT7 vectors from which RNAs were transcribed and translated in vitro. The sequence was found to encode a single long open reading frame continuing from near the 5' terminus of the genome. Although p28 is encoded from the first 1 kilobase at the 5' end of the genome, translation of in vitro-transcribed RNAs indicated that this protein was not detected unless the product of the entire 5.3-kilobase region was synthesized. Translation of RNAs of 3.9 kilobases or smaller yielded proteins which contained the p28 sequence, but p28 was not cleaved. This suggests that the sequence in the region between 3.9 and 5.3 kilobases from the 5' end of the genomic RNA is essential for proteolytic cleavage and contains autoproteolytic activity. The p28 protein could not be cleaved from the smaller primary translation products of gene A, even in the presence of the larger autocleaving protein. Cleavage of the p28 protein was inhibited by addition of the protease inhibitor ZnCl2. This study thus identified a protein domain essential for autoproteolytic cleavage of the gene A polyprotein.","Baker, S C; Shieh, C K; Soe, L H; Chang, M F; Vannier, D M; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,97,1

However, meta-analysis has shown significantly lower overall knee stability rates and more than double the abnormal stability rate with allografts. Some issues surrounding allograft sterilization (ie, risk of disease transmission) are unresolved, and cost is also a concern. Single-bundle ACL reconstruction can produce high stability rates when tunnels are properly placed, but there is evidence that double-bundle repair may offer greater rotatory stability. Cortical fixation has been associated with increased stability owing to the high stiffness of cortical bone. Anterior and posterior approaches are both recommended. The controversy related to single-bundle versus double-bundle ACL reconstruction remains unresolved.","Prodromos, Chadwick C; Fu, Freddie H; Howell, Stephen M; Johnson, Donald H; Lawhorn, Keith",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,97,17

The endogenous small RNAs, called microRNAs, are processed from hairpin precursors and regulate important genes involved in cell death, differentiation, and development. RNAi also protects the genome from invading genetic elements, encoded by transposons and viruses. When small double-stranded RNAs, called small interfering (si)RNAs, are introduced into cells, they bind to the endogenous RNAi machinery to disrupt the expression of mRNAs containing complementary sequences with high specificity. Any disease-causing gene and any cell type or tissue can potentially be targeted. This technique has been rapidly utilized for gene-function analysis and drug-target discovery and validation. Harnessing RNAi also holds great promise for therapy, although introducing siRNAs into cells in vivo remains an important obstacle. Pilot siRNA clinical studies began just three years after the discovery that RNAi works in mammalian cells. This review discusses recent progress and obstacles to using siRNAs as small molecule drugs.","Dykxhoorn, Derek M; Lieberman, Judy",Annual review of biomedical engineering,97,33

Of these components, the tegument is the least well defined in terms of both protein content and function. Several of the major tegument proteins are phosphoproteins (pp), including pp150, pp71, pp65, and pp28. pp28, encoded by the UL99 open reading frame (ORF), traffics to vacuole-like cytoplasmic structures and was shown recently to be essential for envelopment. To elucidate the UL99 amino acid sequences necessary for its trafficking and function in the HCMV replication cycle, two types of viral mutants were analyzed. Using a series of recombinant viruses expressing various UL99-green fluorescent protein fusions, we demonstrate that myristoylation at glycine 2 and an acidic cluster (AC; amino acids 44 to 57) are required for the punctate perinuclear and cytoplasmic (vacuole-like) localization observed for wild-type pp28. A second approach involving the generation of several UL99 deletion mutants indicated that at least the C-terminal two-thirds of this ORF is nonessential for viral growth. Furthermore, the data suggest that an N-terminal region of UL99 containing the AC is required for viral growth. Regarding virion incorporation or UL99-encoded proteins, we provide evidence that suggests that a hypophosphorylated form of pp28 is incorporated, myristoylation is required, and sequences within the first 57 amino acids are sufficient.","Jones, Thomas R; Lee, Shi-Wu",Journal of virology,97,17

Animals infected with ReoV died between day 22 and day 30 postinoculation (PI) while 70% of the animals inoculated with ReoV and SARS-CoV died between day 4 to day 7 PI. The titer of neutralizing antibodies against ReoV and SARS-CoV ranged from 80 to 160 when the animals were inoculated with the two viruses, respectively, while the titer of the antibodies was just below 10 in coinfections. The animal inoculated with ReoV developed diffuse alveolar damage similar to the exudative and leakage inflammation found in SARS patients, and was characterized by diffuse hemorrhage, fibroid exudation, hyaline membrane formation, and type II pneumocytes hyperplasia in alveolar interstitia. The pulmonary epithelial necrosis, excoriation, and early fibrosis of pulmonary tissue were only observed in ReoV-SARS-CoV groups and in SARS-CoV/ReoV groups. Other typical pathological changes included hemorrhagic necrosis in lymph nodes and spleen and hydropic degeneration in the liver. On the contrary, guinea pigs infected with SARS-CoV only developed interstitial pneumonitis. Our experiment demonstrate that ReoV might be one of the primary causes of SARS, since simultaneous coinfection can duplicate the typical pathological changes similar to that of SARS patients.

This review describes the available data for international comparisons and the many factors that need to be addressed for an appropriate interpretation of results. RECENT FINDINGS Recent studies on subgroups of critical care patients include data from many different countries. These new studies provide important information on the overall incidence of these disease states, but most of these international studies do not take into account the critical care resources of the countries being discussed. For an appropriate interpretation of findings the relevant baseline critical care resources, prevalence of diseases, and cultural practices, need to be quantified. The existence of these other factors prevents the use of a severity of illness scoring system alone to account for differences between countries. SUMMARY Many recent critical care studies include data from multiple countries. With continued movement towards international studies, and improvements in data collection systems, comparisons between countries are becoming easier. These findings need to be interpreted in the context of all the relevant country information.","Wunsch, Hannah; Rowan, Kathryn M; Angus, Derek C",Current opinion in critical care,97,26

At the end of 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread throughout China and other countries around the world, resulting in a viral pandemic. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the correlation between ferritin and disease severity in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS In this cross-sectional study, we obtained clinical and laboratory data regarding 39 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 from two hospitals in Israel. RESULTS A significant increase in ferritin levels was demonstrated in patients with moderate and severe disease, compared to patients with mild disease (P = 0.006 and 0.005, respectively). Severe patients had significantly higher levels of ferritin (2817.6 ng/ml) than non-severe patients (708.6 ng/ml) P = 0.02. CONCLUSIONS In this preliminary cross-sectional study, elevated ferritin levels were shown to correlate with disease severity in 39 patients from Israel with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Our results further strengthen the hypothesis that severe COVID-19 disease might be due to an underlying dysregulated hyperimmune response. In order to identify these patients early and prioritized resources, we believe that all patients with COVID-19 should be screened for hyperferritinemia.","Dahan, Shani; Segal, Gad; Katz, Itai; Hellou, Tamar; Tietel, Michal; Bryk, Gabriel; Amital, Howard; Shoenfeld, Yehuda; Dagan, Amir",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,97,1

COVID-19 has caused more than 1 million deaths worldwide and about 50 million infected. COVID-19 not only causes lung injury, but there may also be an involvement of other organs, including the cardiovascular system. SARS-CoV-2 penetrates host cells through the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE-2). ACE-2 is expressed in the lungs, heart, testicles, liver, gastrointestinal tract, etc. Several studies have found that a sizeable percentage of patients with severe COVID-19 also have cardiac lesions, including myocardial fibrosis, edema, and pericarditis. Pathological remodeling of the extracellular matrix caused by SARS-CoV-2 leads to fibrotic lesions of myocardial tissue. These fibrotic lesions can cause cardiac dysfunction, reducing the ejection fraction caused by the presence of stiffened myocardial matrix and leading to heart failure, or cause an alteration in electrical conductance by creating cardiac arrhythmias. These cardiac dysfunctions can be fatal if left untreated and managed. It is therefore essential to identify cardiac involvement early in order to act with appropriate treatments to preserve the integrity of the heart. In this review, we describe what is known about cardiac damage from COVID-19, including the scientific rationale for effective therapeutic solutions to combat cardiac injury, and reduce or avoid cardiac damage from COVID-19.","Ferrara, Francesco; Vitiello, Antonio",Discovery medicine,97,12

Adopting a just-in-time staffing policy, they employed fewer full-time workers, scheduled part-time workers to work regular shifts, took on more casual staff, and became increasingly reliant on agency nurses and overtime to cover shifts. These policies resulted in higher costs and reduced surge capacity, and placed the health of nurses and patients in jeopardy. Fewer staff meant more overtime. Stress-related absenteeism increased. Some nurses reacted to casualization by working for multiple employers. During the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic in Toronto, nursing resources were stretched to their limits. An exploratory investigation, based on relevant literature and interviews with 13 nurse administrators who held key positions during the epidemic, confirmed the lack of spare capacity in the health care system and indicated that community and long-term care sectors had less capacity than acute care. Low surge capacity in these sectors increased the vulnerability of the entire health care system. Capacity issues should be addressed as part of a larger human resources initiative to create a more flexible workforce.

METHODS A standardized 2 × 4 cm(2) fascial defect was created in 30 Wistar rats and repaired with either a cross-linked or a non-cross-linked graft. The rats were killed 3, 6, and 12 months later. The strength of incorporation, vascularization, cellular invasion, foreign body reaction, and capsule formation were evaluated. RESULTS Both graft materials showed cellular ingrowth and neovascularization by 3 months postimplantation. The average level of cellularization was significantly higher in the non-cross-linked grafts than in the cross-linked grafts at 6 months (2 vs 1; P = .029). Vascularization was significantly higher in the non-cross-linked grafts than in the cross-linked grafts at 6 months postimplantation (2 vs 1; P = .029) and insignificant at 3 months (2 vs 1.75; P = .311) and 12 months (1 vs 0.67; P = 1). The maximum load and breaking strength of both biomaterials increased during the study period. Overall, the strength of incorporation of the non-cross-linked grafts increased from 3 months (0.75 MPa) to 12 months (3.06 MPa) postimplantation.

However, it is not known how the putative MHV RdRp (Pol) is targeted to and retained on cellular membranes. In this report, we show that a 100-kDa protein was stably detected by an anti-Pol antiserum as a mature product throughout the virus life cycle. Gradient fractionation and biochemical extraction experiments demonstrated that Pol was not an integral membrane protein but was tightly associated with membranes and coimmunoprecipitated with the replicase proteins 3CLpro, p22, and p12. By immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, Pol colocalized with viral proteins at replication complexes, distinct from sites of virion assembly, over the entire course of infection. To determine if Pol associated with cellular membranes in the absence of other viral factors, the pol domain of gene 1 was cloned and expressed in cells as a fusion with green fluorescent protein, termed Gpol. In Gpol-expressing cells that were infected with MHV, but not in mock-infected cells, Gpol relocalized from a diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm to punctate foci that colocalized with markers for replication complexes. Expression of Gpol deletion mutants established that the conserved enzymatic domains of Pol were dispensable for replication complex association, but a 38-amino-acid domain in the RdRp unique region of Pol was required. This study demonstrates that viral or virus-induced factors are necessary for Pol to associate with membranes of replication complexes, and it identifies a defined region of Pol that may mediate its interactions with those factors.","Brockway, Sarah M; Clay, Corrie T; Lu, Xiao Tao; Denison, Mark R",Journal of virology,97,26

The three S1 ORFs of the avian reovirus strain S1133 were individually expressed in bacterial cells, and their purified translation products used as antigens to raise specific polyclonal antibodies. With these antibodies we were able to demonstrate that all three S1 ORFs from different avian reovirus strains are translatable in infected cells. Proteins p10 and p17, which are specified by ORF1 and ORF2, respectively, are nonstructural proteins which associate with cell membranes, whereas ORF3 directs the synthesis of protein sigma C, a structural oligomeric protein responsible for cell attachment. While intracellular synthesis of protein sigma C was demonstrated a long time ago and that of protein p10 was reported recently, this is the first time that expression of the S1 ORF2 has been demonstrated experimentally. Thus, the previously reported coding capacity of the avian reovirus genome is now expanded to 14 proteins, of which ten are structural (lambda A, lambda B, lambda C, microA, microB, microBC, microBN, sigma A, sigma B, and sigma C) and four are nonstructural (microNS, sigma NS, p17, and p10). Finally, protein p10, but not p17 or sigma C, induces cell-cell fusion when transiently expressed in mammalian cells, supporting a previously published observation that the polypeptide encoded by the S1 ORF1 plays an important role in the syncytial phenotype displayed by avian reoviruses.","Bodelón, G; Labrada, L; Martínez-Costas, J; Benavente, J",Virology,97,1

METHODS Retrospective cohort of all patients admitted during March 13, 2020 through May 13, 2020 with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 to 3 tertiary-care hospitals. Patient-level data (demographic, clinical manifestations, comorbid illnesses, inpatient treatment) were analyzed. The main outcome variable was atypical presentation, defined as any hospitalized patient with COVID-19 infection who did not experience both fever and cough. We identified risk factors for atypical presentation on univariate and multivariate analyses and assessed 30-day mortality differences via survival analysis. RESULTS Of 163 patients in the study, 39 (24%) were atypical. On univariate analysis, atypical cases were significantly more likely to be older, reside in a long-term-care facility (LTCF), and have underlying diabetes mellitus, stroke, or cardiac disease; present without dyspnea or myalgia, have lower C-reactive proteins (CRP) and higher beta-natriuretic peptides. They were less likely to receive intensive care unit care or specific COVID-19 treatments (P < .05). The incidence of acute respiratory failure was not significantly different between the groups. On logistic regression, atypical cases were significantly more likely to be LTCF residents (P = 0.003) and have a lower average CRP (P = 0.01). Atypical cases had significantly higher 30-day mortality (hazard ratio 3.4 [95% CI, 1.6 - 7.2], P = 0.002). CONCLUSION During the first pandemic surge, COVID-19 patients without inflammatory signs and symptoms were more likely to be LTCF residents and had higher mortality. Timely recognition of these atypical presentations may have prevented spread and improved clinical outcomes.","Pop-Vicas, Aurora; Haleem, Ambar; Osman, Fauzia; Fuglestad, Ryan; Shirley, Daniel; Striker, Robert; Safdar, Nasia",WMJ : official publication of the State Medical Society of Wisconsin,97,31

The limit of detection (LOD) and clinical performance of this new assay were evaluated. A LOD study with inactivated virus exhibited performance equal to the modified CDC assay, with a final LOD of 1301 ± 13 genome equivalents/mL for the Northwell Health Laboratories laboratory-developed test (NWHL LDT) versus 1249 ± 14 genome equivalents/mL for the modified CDC assay. In addition, a clinical evaluation with 270 nasopharyngeal swab specimens exhibited 98.5% positive percent agreement and 99.3% negative percent agreement compared with the modified CDC assay. The NWHL LDT multiplex design allows testing of 91 patients per plate, versus a maximum of 29 patients per plate on the modified CDC assay, providing the benefit of testing significantly more patients per run and saving reagents, during a time when both of these parameters are critical. The results show that the NWHL LDT multiplex assay performs as well as the modified CDC assay but is more efficient and cost-effective and can be used as a diagnostic assay and for epidemiologic surveillance and clinical management of SARS-CoV-2.","Zhen, Wei; Berry, Gregory J",J. mol. diagn,97,30

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 31 (20 male, 11 female) cases (with 38 eyes) who underwent secondary IAC and/or IVC between February 2010 and June 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Thirteen (41.9%) cases had unilateral and 18 (58.1%) had bilateral RB. According to the International Classification of RB, 6 (15.8%) eyes had group B, 9 (23.7%) eyes had group C, 16 (42.1%) eyes had group D, and 7 (18.4%) eyes had group E RB at diagnosis. All patients underwent six-cycle intravenous chemotherapy as primary treatment and 8 eyes received external radiotherapy before IAC/IVC. Secondary IAC was performed in 21 (55.3%) eyes, IVC in 10 (26.3%) eyes, and IAC + IVC in 7 (18.4%) eyes. External radiotherapy was applied in 2 (5.3%) eyes after IAC/IVC, one of which was later enucleated. In total, 17 (44.7%) eyes undergoing secondary IAC/IVC treatments were enucleated. Metastasis and death were not observed in any case during the mean follow-up period of 59.3 (median 61, range: 10-98) months. DISCUSSION: Although 60.5% of the eyes undergoing IAC/IVC consisted of groups D and E RB, globe salvage and survival rates were 55.3% and 100.0%, respectively. External radiotherapy was required in 5.3% of the eyes after IAC/IVC. In conclusion, IAC and IVC are safe and effective treatment methods in eyes with RB unresponsive to other eye-preserving treatments and those demonstrating recurrence.","Mirzayev, Ibadulla; Gündüz, Ahmet Kaan; Yavuz, Kivilcim; Sekkeli, Mehmet Zahid; Özalp Ates, Funda Seher; Ünal, Emel; Taçyildiz, Nurdan",Eur J Ophthalmol,97,1

Human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE2) serves as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to infect people via binding to spike proteins. Herein we report development and characterization of a rapidly deployable COVID-19 mouse model. C57BL/6J (B6) mice expressing hACE2 in the lung were transduced by oropharyngeal delivery of the recombinant human adenovirus type 5 that expresses hACE2 (Ad5-hACE2). Mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at day 4 post-transduction and developed interstitial pneumonia associated with perivascular inflammation, accompanied by significantly higher viral load in lungs at days 3, 6, and 12 post-infection compared to Ad5-empty control group. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in pneumocytes in alveolar septa. Transcriptomic analysis of lungs demonstrated that the infected Ad5-hACE mice had a significant increase in interferon-dependent chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl10, and genes associated with effector T cell populations including Cd3g, Cd8a, and Gzmb. Pathway analysis showed that several KEGG pathways were enriched in the dataset, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, the chemokine signaling pathway, the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, the measles pathway, and the IL-17 signaling pathway. This response is correlative to clinical response in lungs of COVID-19 patients. These results demonstrate that expression of hACE2 via adenovirus delivery system sensitized the mouse to SARS-CoV-2 infection and resulted in the development of a mild COVID-19 phenotype, highlighting the immune and inflammatory host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This rapidly deployable COVID-19 mouse model is useful for preclinical and pathogenesis studies of COVID-19.

Our primary objective was to assess whether gout is a risk factor for diagnosis of COVID-19 and death related to COVID-19. The secondary objectives were to test for sex- and drug-specific differences in risk. MethodsWe used data from the UK Biobank that included 15,560 people with gout. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression was employed in the following analyses using a case-control study design: Analysis A, to test for association between gout and COVID-19 diagnosis (n=459,837); Analysis B, to test for association between gout and death related to COVID-19 in a case-control cohort of people who died or survived with COVID-19 (n=16,336); Analysis C, to test for association between gout and death related to COVID-19 in the entire UK Biobank cohort (n=459,837); Analysis D, to stratify by prescription of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and colchicine on the risk of death related to COVID-19 in a subset of the UK Biobank cohort with medication data (n=341,398). FindingsGout was associated with diagnosis of COVID-19 in analysis A (OR=1.2 [1.1 ; 1.3]) but not with risk of death in the COVID-19-diagnosed group in analysis B. In analysis C gout associated with risk of death related to COVID-19 in the unadjusted model (OR=3.9 [3.3 ; 4.7]), in Model 1 adjusted for demographic factors (OR=1.8 [1.5 ; 2.1]) and in the fully adjusted Model 2 (OR=1.3 [1.1 ; 1.6]). In Analysis C risk was higher in women than men in Model 1 adjusted for demographic factors (OR=3.5 [2.4 ; 5.0] and OR=1.5 [1.2 ; 1.8], respectively) with the difference maintained after additional adjustment for eight metabolic co-morbidities (ORMen=1.2 [0.9 ; 1.5], ORWomen=1.9 [1.3 ; 2.9]). There were no statistically significant differences in risk of death related to COVID-19 according to prescription of ULT or colchicine. InterpretationGout is a risk factor for death related to COVID-19 using the UK Biobank cohort with an increased risk in women with gout that was also driven by risk factors outside metabolic co-morbidities of gout. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThere are no studies investigating the risk of COVID-19 diagnosis and risk of death with COVID-19 in people with gout. Added value of this studyThe findings provide evidence that gout is a risk factor for diagnosis of COVID-19 and that gout is a risk factor for death with COVID-19, independent of included co-morbidities. Women with gout are at a higher risk of death with COVID-19 than men with gout. Implications of the available evidenceThe new evidence demonstrate that gout is a risk factor for death from COVID-19, particularly in women. This information will inform clinical decision-making in people with gout diagnosed with COVID-19. Future research should focus on replicating these findings, including a focus on understanding key factor(s) explaining the increased risk of death with COVID-19 in women with gout.","Topless, Ruth; Gaffo, Angelo; Stamp, Lisa; Robinson, Philip; Dalbeth, Nicola; Merriman, Tony",,97,16

Then we isolated the extracellular vesicles (EVs) of plasma from 19 healthy subjects and 67 recovered COVID-19 patients. Mass Spectrometry was used to catalogue the proteins of these EVs compared to a defined group of controls. Identified 174 proteins were differentially expressed in the EVs of COVID-19 patients compared with healthy subjects, which involved in lipid metabolic process, response to cellular, and response to stress oxygen-containing compound. Besides, we identified several protein of plasma EVs in recovered patients associated with coagulation activity, inflammatory reaction, immune response, and low organ function. In addition, proteins correlating with clinical index such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were also detected. Moreover, we also identified many unique or characteristic associations found in the recovered COVID-19 patients, which especially involved the kidney, serum electrolyte levels, and inflammation functions. This finding suggests that monitoring the situation of recovered patients might be useful, especially the indexes of coagulation, inflammation, immunity, and organ function, which can prevent bleeding, reinfection and organ dysfunction.","Mao, Kaimin; Tan, Qi; Ma, Yanling; Wang, Sufei; Zhong, Hua; Liao, Yuhan; Huang, Qi; Xiao, Wenjing; Xia, Hui; Tan, Xueyun; Luo, Ping; Xu, Juanjuan; Long, Danling; Jin, Yang",Cell Death Dis,97,14

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant medication, supply and equipment, and provider shortages, limiting the resources available for provision of surgical care. In response to mandates restricting surgery to high-acuity procedures during this period, our institution developed a multidisciplinary Low-Resource Operating Room (LROR) Taskforce in April 2020. This study describes our institutional experience developing an LROR to maintain access to urgent surgical procedures during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. A delineation of available resources and resource replacement strategies was conducted, and a final institution-wide plan for operationalizing the LROR was formed. Specialty-specific subgroups then convened to determine best practices and opportunities for LROR utilization. Orthopedic surgery performed in the LROR using wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet (WALANT) is presented as a use case. Results. Overall, 19 limited resources were identified, spanning across the domains of physical space, drugs, devices and equipment, and personnel. Based on the assessment, the decision to proceed with creation of an LROR was made. Sixteen urgent orthopedic surgeries were successfully performed using WALANT without conversion to general anesthesia. Conclusion. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a LROR was successfully designed and operationalized. The process for development of a LROR and recommended strategies for operating in a resource-constrained environment may serve as a model for other institutions and facilitate rapid implementation of this care model should the need arise in future pandemic or disaster situations.","Turcotte, Justin J; Gelfand, Jeffrey M; Jones, Christopher M; Jackson, Rubie S",Surg Innov,97,1

The effects of protracted social isolation, and media related misinformation's about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulting in increased fear/stress related to the insufficiently known illness. The aim was to assess the influence of the COVID-19 health crisis on patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). METHODS: A cross-sectional study on 29 adult CIDP patients was performed. The Medical Research Council scale was used to evaluate muscle strength. The degree of functional disability was measured using the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment disability scale. The overall quality of life (QoL) was self-estimated on a 0-100 numeric rating scale. We also used a specifically designed 22-question-survey about COVID-19. RESULTS: Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, 62% of CIDP patients were concerned. The daily activities of 55% of patients were negatively influenced by the pandemic. During the COVID-19 outbreak, 21% of patients reported their CIDP got worse. In 39% of CIDP patients, the influence of the pandemic on CIDP therapy was reported (reducing the dose or time interval or even discontinuation). The mean value of the self-estimated QoL was 64 ± 19. Independent predictors of worse QoL were age of patients (beta = -0.35, p < 0.05) and fear of the COVID-19 (beta = -0.34, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on CIDP patients. Besides the direct influence of the virus and fear of the virus, restrictive measures can indirectly harm the patients with CIDP.","Stojanov, Aleksandar; Bozovic, Ivo; Stojanov, Jelena; Palibrk, Aleksa; Djordjevic, Gordana; Basta, Ivana; Malobabic, Marina; Arsic, Ana Azanjac; Peric, Stojan",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,97,24

The virus then spread to most countries in the world. As an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 may acquire mutations that may be fixed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the selective pressure acting on SARS-CoV-2 protein coding genes. Methods: Mutations and glycosylation site prediction were analyzed in SARS-CoV-2 genomes (from 464 to 477 sequences). Results: Selective pressure on surface glycoprotein (S) revealed one positively selected site (AA 943), located outside the receptor binding domain (RBD). Mutation analysis identified five residues on the surface glycoprotein, with variations (AA positions 367, 458, 477, 483, 491) located inside the RDB. Positive selective pressure was identified in nsp2, nsp3, nsp4, nsp6, nsp12, helicase, ORF3a, ORF8, and N sub-sets. A total of 22 predicted N-glycosylation positions were found in the SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein; one of them, 343N, was located within the RBD. One predicted N-glycosylation site was found in the M protein and 4 potential O-glycosylation sites in specific protein 3a sequences. Conclusion: Overall, the data showed positive pressure and mutations acting on specific protein coding genes. These findings may provide useful information on: i) markers for vaccine design, ii) new therapeutic approach, iii) information to implement mutagenesis experiments to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. The negative selection identified in SARS-CoV-2 protein coding genes may help the identification of highly conserved regions useful to implement new future diagnostic protocols.","Lo Presti, Alessandra; Rezza, Giovanni; Stefanelli, Paola",Heliyon,97,5

Studies show that cytokine storms and imbalances in T-helper (Th)1/Th2 play a significant role in most acute cases of the disease. A number of medications have been suggested to treat or control the disease but have been discontinued due to their side effects. Melatonin, as an intrinsic molecule, possesses pharmacological anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that decreases in concentration with age; as a result, older people are more prone to various diseases. In this study, patients who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were given a melatonin adjuvant (9 mg daily, orally) for fourteen days. In order to measure markers of Th1 and Th2 inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and interferon (IFN)-Î³) as well as the expression of Th1 and Th2 regulatory genes (signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)4, STAT6, GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3), and T-box expressed in T cell (T-bet)), blood samples were taken from patients at the beginning and end of the treatment. Adjuvant therapy with melatonin controlled and reduced inflammatory cytokines in patients with COVID-19. Melatonin also controlled and modulated the dysregulated genes that regulate the humoral and cellular immune systems mediated by Th1 and Th2. In this study, it was shown for the first time that melatonin can be used as a medicinal adjuvant with anti-inflammatory mechanism to reduce and control inflammatory cytokines by regulating the expression of Th1 and Th2 regulatory genes in patients with COVID-19.","Hosseini, Abdolkarim; Esmaeili Gouvarchin Ghaleh, Hadi; Aghamollaei, Hossein; Fasihi Ramandi, Mahdi; Alishiri, Gholamhossein; Shahriary, Alireza; Hassanpour, Kazem; Tat, Mahdi; Farnoosh, Gholamreza",Eur J Pharmacol,97,33

Interestingly, we also found ACE2 positivity inside the cell nucleus. The ACE2 levels changed during cell differentiation and aging and varied in distinct cell types. We observed ACE2 depletion in the aortas of aging female mice, similarly, the aging caused ACE2 decrease in the kidneys. Compared with that in the heart, brain and kidneys, the ACE2 level was the lowest in the mouse lungs. In mice exposed to nicotine, ACE2 was not changed in olfactory bulbs but in the lungs, ACE2 was upregulated in females and downregulated in males. These observations indicate the distinct gender-dependent properties of ACE2. Differentiation into enterocytes, and cardiomyocytes, caused ACE2 depletion. The cardiomyogenesis was accompanied by renin upregulation, delayed in HDAC1-depleted cells. In contrast, vitamin D2 decreased the renin level while ACE2 was upregulated. Together, the ACE2 level is high in non-differentiated cells. This protein is more abundant in the tissues of mouse embryos and young mice in comparison with older animals. Mostly, downregulation of ACE2 is accompanied by renin upregulation. Thus, the pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease should be further studied not only by considering the ACE2 level but also the whole renin-angiotensin system.","Bártová, Eva; Legartová, Sona; Krejcí, Jana; Arcidiacono, Orazio Angelo",Aging (Albany NY),97,8

METHODS: Fish were collected using multi-panel gill nets. The gills of each fish were washed and examined for copepods using a stereo microscope. The copepods found were stored in 70% ethanol, cleared in lactic acid, and mounted in Hoyer's medium. Drawings were made with the aid of a microscope equipped with a drawing tube. RESULTS: The new copepod species can be distinguished from its two congeners, Rhinergasilus piranhus (type-species) Boeger et Thatcher, 1988 and Rhinergasilus digitus Narciso, Brandão, Perbiche-Neves et Silva, 2020, due to its extremely long antennary claw (etymology of the species), being longer than the other antennary segments; third leg lacking any interpodal plate; and third endopodal segment of third leg lacking a distal spine.

This virus emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei, China. The grim fact of COVID-19 is, it is highly contagious in nature, therefore, spreads rapidly all over the world and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Responding to the severity of COVID-19 research community directs the attention to the analysis of COVID-19, to diminish its antagonistic impact towards society. Numerous studies claim that the subcontinent, i.e., Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, could remain in the worst affected region by the COVID-19. In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is important to predict the trend of COVID-19 beforehand the planning of effective control strategies. Fundamentally, the idea is to dependably estimate the reproduction number to judge the spread rate of COVID-19 in a particular region. Consequently, this paper uses publicly available epidemiological data of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan to estimate the reproduction numbers. More specifically, we use various models (for example, susceptible infection recovery (SIR), exponential growth (EG), sequential Bayesian (SB), maximum likelihood (ML) and time dependent (TD)) to estimate the reproduction numbers and observe the model fitness in the corresponding data set. Experimental results show that the reproduction numbers produced by these models are greater than 1.2 (approximately) indicates that COVID-19 is gradually spreading in the subcontinent.","Singh, Bikash Chandra; Alom, Zulfikar; Rahman, Mohammad Muntasir; Baowaly, Mrinal Kanti; Azim, Mohammad Abdul",,97,16

Concurrently, the annual challenge of wintry conditions to a population adapted to warmer conditions persists. Remarkably, however, there are no proven interventions to reduce seasonal challenges to the cardiovascular health of vulnerable individuals. In a world-first, the REsilience to Seasonal ILlness and Increased Emergency admissioNs CarE (RESILIENCE) Trial will test the hypothesis that an individually tailored, intervention program will reduce the risk of re-hospitalisation and mortality in vulnerable individuals. Design and method: 300 adult patients admitted to the Austin Hospital in Melbourne, Australia with heart disease and multimorbidity will be recruited and randomised (1:1) to standard care (SC) or the RESILIENCE program (RP) over 12-months. Applying a COVID-19 adapted protocol, the RP group will have their bio-behavioural profile and home environment assessed post-discharge, to determine their vulnerability to seasonal events. An individualised case-management program, including a virtual clinic review with a dedicated RP cardiac nurse and physician, will be applied to promote seasonal resilience. The primary end-point is all-cause days alive out of hospital (DAOH) during 12-month follow-up. Results: With study recruitment delayed due to COVID-19 restrictions, virtual screening of medical in-patients has confirmed the need and potential for the RP. Of 630 potential participants identified over a 6 week period, 196 patients (31%) met eligibility criteria-85 women and 79 men, mean (±SD) age 79 ± 11 years. Non-eligibility was largely due to non-chronic form of heart disease (34%), no comorbidity (23 %), and inability to give informed consent (15%). Conclusions: Preliminary data suggest that once commenced, we will rapidly recruit the requisite number of trial participants and depending on the results, we will be able to determine the cost-effectiveness of the RP to reduce seasonallyinduced admissions and mortality.","Moini, N.; Patel, S.

For the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing COVID-19, fever, cough, and gastrointestinal complaints are the most common symptoms in children, and a hyperimmune response may be present. No detailed temporally associated neurological complications have been documented in pediatric case series so far. Case description: We present the case of a 3-months-old girl with non-febrile repeated seizures in a COVID-19 family setting. The infant started with a mild fever and cough that lasted for 2 days. At day 6 from onset, the girl presented with two focal motor seizures with impaired consciousness and awareness. All investigations ruled out signs of meningo-encephalitis or active epilepsy, including normal electroencephalogram and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. PCR from nasal and throat swabs was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Remarkably, blood ferritin and D-dimer levels were increased. At day 9, the infant presented another afebrile motor seizure, and levetiracetam dose was modified there was a favorable response within 3 months of the follow-up. Much interest has been raised with regards to host genetic determinants to disease severity and susceptibility to COVID-19. We thus performed whole exome sequencing, revealing a pathogenic frameshift mutation in the PRRT2 gene in both the mother and the infant. The mother had presented two late infantile febrile convulsions with normal outcome afterwards. Discussion: The hyperimmune response described in adult cases with COVID-19 can be seen in infants, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms. Moreover, COVID-19 may present in infants as non-febrile seizures, triggering early onset seizures in infants with a genetic predisposition. In this pandemic situation, precision medicine using massive sequencing can shed light on underlying molecular mechanisms driving the host response to COVID-19.","García-Howard, Marcos; Herranz-Aguirre, Mercedes; Moreno-Galarraga, Laura; Urretavizcaya-Martínez, María; Alegría-Echauri, Josune; Gorría-Redondo, Nerea; Planas-Serra, Laura; Schlüter, Agatha; Gut, Marta; Pujol, Aurora; Aguilera-Albesa, Sergio",Front.

The nanozyme prevents the mitochondrial damage in SOD1 and SOD2-depleted cells by regulating the superoxide levels and restores the physiological levels of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins.

Increased immune andinflammatory responses, and procoagulant profile have characterized COVID patients. All theseresponses may induce endothelial dysfunction, myocardial injury, plaque instability, and AMI.Disease severity and mortality are increased by cardiovascular comorbidities. Moreover, COVID-19has been associated with air pollution, which may also represent an AMI risk factor. Nonetheless,a significant reduction in patient admissions following containment initiatives has been observed,including for AMI. The reasons for this phenomenon are largely unknown, although a real decreasein the incidence of cardiac events seems highly improbable. Instead, patients likely may presentdelayed time from symptoms onset and subsequent referral to emergency departments because offear of possible in-hospital infection, and as such, may present more complications.

PCC 7120,9.981194,7.57029,2020,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019 a novel coronavirus designated SARS-CoV-2 was identified, and the disease COVID-19 has caused many deaths. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with the development of cytokine storm (including interleukin 6 (IL-6)), which can cause lung damage and lack of oxygen. Tocilizumab (TCZ) inhibits ligand binding to the IL-6 receptor and may be a potential treatment for the hyperinflammation symptoms of COVID-19. However, data regarding the efficacy of TCZ in COVID-19 are lacking. The rapid spread of the pandemic in France, especially in the Paris region, constrained us to the off-label use of TCZ in patients with severe clinical conditions. METHODS: A single-centre observational cohort study of 44 patients infected with COVID-19 was carried out between 6 April and 21 April 2020 in Groupe Hospitalier Intercommunal Le Raincy-Montfermeil (GHILRM). Twenty-two patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were treated with TCZ and were compared with 22 patients not treated with TCZ matched for age, gender and length of hospital stay for COVID-19. Respiratory rate and oxygen supplementation as well as laboratory parameters (such as C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) were collected at baseline and during 14 days of follow-up. Our primary objective was to assess the efficacy of TCZ on respiratory clinical conditions. FINDINGS: The average respiratory rate was lower in the TCZ group than in the control group (21.5 vs 25.5 breaths/min at day 14, 95% CI -7.5 to -0.4; p=0.03). Treated patients tended to be intubated less during the course of the disease (2/22 vs 6/22, 95% CI -0.4 to 0.1; p=0.12). In each group, 10 patients no longer required oxygen therapy. We found a significant decrease in CRP in treated patients on day 7 (p=0.04). TCZ caused cytolysis in more than half (14/22) of the patients but without clinical impact. INTERPRETATION: There was a significant difference in the respiratory rate on day 14 of follow-up, with a greater decrease observed in the treated group. Fewer patients required mechanical ventilation in the TCZ group, especially among patients with more extensive CT lung damage, than in the control group. The same number of patients were weaned off oxygen on day 14 in the two groups, while the patients in the TCZ group had more severe impairment at inclusion. We consider that TCZ showed significant control of the biological inflammatory syndrome, suggesting that it may limit the effect of the cytokine storm. Our study seems to indicate the efficacy of TCZ, particularly in patients with severe initial pulmonary impairment. Selecting the best candidates and the best timing for TCZ therapy needs to be determined in randomised clinical trials.","Albertini, Laetitia; Soletchnik, Mickael; Razurel, Anais; Cohen, Johana; Bidegain, Frédéric; Fauvelle, Francis; Safrano, Geoffroy; Piquet, Jacques; Maurer, Cyril; Goldgran-Toledano, Dany",,97,10

A total of 40 patients with yidu-toxicity blocking lung syndrome, diagnosed as severe pneumonia of SARS-COV-2 following the latest Chinese national recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by SARS-COV-2 (the 5th edition), were recruited. They were randomly divided into the pure western medicine therapy group (PWM) and integrated into Chinese and Western medicine therapy group (ICW). The general strategies were given to both groups according to the national recommendations, and the ICW group was given Yidu-toxicity blocking lung decoction extraorally. A radioimmunoassay method was adopted to detect the content of IL-6, IL-8,IL-2R,TNF-&#945;, procalcitonin (PCT) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in sera. Flow cytometry was used to determine the peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets (the levels of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and the ratios of CD4+/CD8+). The white blood cell counts (WBC#), neutrophils count(N#), and lymphocyte counts (L#) were measured using a fully automatic blood rheological instrument. The t-test or Rank Sum Test and Spearman analysis were conducted to evaluate the differences. The results showed that IL-6 (P = 0.013) and TNF-&#945; (P = 0.035) levels in the PWM group were significantly higher than those in the ICW group after treatment. Infection related indicators such as WBC#, N#, L#, hs-CRP showed no differences. The analysis showed that there was no statistical difference in the values of CD4 and CD8 between the two groups. By the end of Day 29, all patients were discharged and the final cure rate for both group were 100 %. Taken together, we conclude that Yidu-toxicity blocking lung decoction could relieve inflammation of SARS-COV-2 patients with yidu-toxicity blocking lung syndrome by eliminating inflammatory agents. CM can serve as a complementary medication to western medicine, which should be highlighted in clinical settings.","Zhao, Jie; Yang, Xiaodong; Wang, Chenghua; Song, Shuai; Cao, Kun; Wei, Taohua; Ji, Qiaoxue; Zheng, Wanqun; Li, Jiali; Zhou, Xue; Liu, Jie",Biomed Pharmacother,97,4

The aim of this scoping review is therefore to identify available practice recommendations on contraception and safe abortion care service provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We searched guideline databases and websites of professional associations and international organizations working on sexual and reproductive health. Additionally, we searched: PubMed, EMBASE Google Scholar MedRxiv and Research Square. We included English records labelled guideline, or recommendation, or consensus, or practice parameter, as well as position papers on contraception and safe abortion care service practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data extraction was done by two independent reviewers using a customized tool that was developed to record the key information of the source that is relevant to the review question. The difference between the two authors on data extraction was resolved by discussion. RESULTS: Fourteen records on safe abortion care and thirteen records on contraception service were identified. Identified recommendations were categorized into thematic areas. The records addressed approaches to the safe medication and surgical abortion, self-serving family planning and long-term and reversible contraception. CONCLUSIONS: Consensus statements and recommendations consistently stated that there should be access to contraception service and safe abortion care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The practice recommendations focus on innovative ways of service provision to minimize patient and staff exposure to COVID-19, as well as alleviate the burden on the health care system. These include utilizing telemedicine or digital health and community/home-based care or self-care. © 2020 Universidad Nacional Experimental Rafael Maria Baralt.

In order to assess the sustainability of sleeping troubles related to the sanitary crisis, it was crucial to measure its prevalence after the end of the Covid-19 confinement. METHODS: As part of an epidemiological survey on Covid and Confinement (COCONEL), we enquired on sleep disorders using two items in 4 repetitive cross-sectional surveys. The first took place during the first week of the French confinement (March 31 to April 2; N = 1005 participants). The second took place in the middle of this period (April 15-17; N = 1005). The two last surveys were held at the end of the confinement (May 7-10; N = 2003) and one month after the end (June 10-12; N = 1736). Using a random constant, the mixed model took into account the longitudinal character of the last two waves (intra-individual correlations for individuals surveyed in waves 3 and 4). RESULTS: The prevalence of sleep problems significantly decreased during the last weeks of the confinement, and this trend was confirmed one month after the end of confinement. One quarter of the population reported that their sleep was better one month after the end of the confinement. Sleep improvement was reported more often by women and people aged less than 65. Such improvement was less frequent among those who were still highly exposed to the pandemic's media coverage after the end of the confinement. CONCLUSION: The possibility of recovering a good sleep largely depends on the type of sleep disorder. The decrease in sleep problems occurred mainly among people with mild sleep problems during the confinement. Further research is needed to assess the long-term effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and its confinement period on sleep quality in the general population.","Beck, Francois; Leger, Damien; Cortaredona, Sebastien; Verger, Pierre; Peretti-Watel, Patrick",Sleep Med,97,26

Background: The measures initiated as a result of the coronavirus pandemic have far-reaching consequences for the everyday life of people with dementia and their family carers. Both are usually among those who are the most vulnerable and thus are subject to rigorous restrictions. Their everyday life is made more difficult because care and respite services are currently suspended. In addition, people with dementia have difficulty understanding and implementing the restrictions and hygiene rules. AIMS: This study aims to describe the current life situation of family carers and people with dementia. METHODS: For this purpose, 21 telephone interviews with both family carers and people with dementia have been conducted twice during the spring of 2020 and were subsequently evaluated by a content analysis. RESULTS: The interviewees experienced the situation differently. Especially the social isolation, the higher amount of care, the uncertainty of the situation and the increase in psychological symptoms are described as being stressful. With regard to coping with the situation, discussions are taking place about the support from the social environment, alternative ways of communication, experiences with comparable crises, the stability of formal care and the handling of information. CONCLUSIONS: Family carers and people with dementia feel stressed due to the coronavirus pandemic, but many of them have coping strategies for this special situation. Informal support is a particularly important support mechanism.","Geyer, Jennifer; Böhm, Fabiola; Müller, Julia; Friedrichs, Juliane; Klatt, Thomas; Schiller, Christine; Kißlinger, Viktoria; Meyer, Gabriele; Heinrich, Stephanie",Pflege,97,16

METHODS: We analyzed data from patients confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2-positive from February through May 2020. The data were obtained from clinical laboratories, primary health care providers, and hospitals. Previously recorded comorbidities, including diabetes, cancer, circulatory diseases, chronic pulmonary, and kidney disease, were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 2249 patients, 46.0% were men (median age 51 years; median disease duration 27 days). Hospitalization was required for 41.8% patients, mechanical ventilation for 2.5%, while 4.7% of all patients died. Patients who died were significantly older (median 82 vs 50 years, P<0.001) with a higher prevalence of all investigated comorbidities (all p's <0.001), more frequently required mechanical ventilation (34% vs 1%, P<0.001), and had shorter length of hospital stay (median 13 vs 27 days, P<0.001) with no sex preponderance. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation were significantly older (median age 70 vs 51 years, P<0.001), more frequently men (59.6% vs 45.7%, P=0.037), showed a higher prevalence of all comorbidities except ischemic heart and chronic kidney disease (all p's <0.001), and demonstrated a higher case-fatality rate (63.2% vs 3.2%, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients who died in the first pandemic wave in Croatia were more likely to suffer previous somatic comorbidities. This corroborates the findings of similar studies and calls for further research into the underlying disease mechanisms, hence providing ground for more efficient preventive measures.","Capak, Krunoslav; Brkic-Bilos, Ivana; Kralj, Verica; Poljicanin, Tamara; Sekerija, Mario; Ivanko, Pero; Drausnik, Zeljka; Mihel, Sandra; Fustin, Danijela; Cerovecki, Ivan; Svajda, Marija; Dimnjakovic, Jelena; Sarajlic, Gordan; Benjak, Tomislav",Croat Med J,97,24

Critical care bed capacity per capita in Ireland is among the lowest in Europe, thus, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put additional strain on an over-stretched system. COVID-19 Community Assessment Hubs (CAHs) were established to mitigate unnecessary admission to acute hospitals, and reduce infection spread by supporting COVID-19 positive or suspected positive patients to isolate at home, or in isolation facilities. There is some evidence that similar assessment centres may be a successful triage strategy to reduce burden on hospital and acute care. Aim : The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 Community Assessment Hubs on service delivery in one region in Ireland. Methods: A mixed-methods approach will be used, incorporating co-design to engage stakeholders and ensure informed data capture and analysis. Online surveys will assess CAH patients' experiences of access to and quality of care. Clinical patient data from CAHs will be collected and analysed using multinomial logistic regression to check for association with patient demographics and COVID-19 symptoms, and CAH early warning scores and outcomes (Transfer to Emergency Department, Transfer to isolation unit, Sent home with care plan). Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with: patients to elicit an in-depth understanding of experiences and acceptability of attending CAHs;and staff to understand challenges, benefits, and effectiveness of CAHs. Interview data will be analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Discussion: This study will provide valuable insights from both patient and staff perspectives on the operation of CAHs. We will evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of CAHs and propose areas for improvement of the service. This will contribute to international literature on the use of community assessment centres during infectious disease pandemics.","Mulcahy Symmons, S.; Fox, R.; Mannion, M.; Joyce, D.; De Brún, A.; Glynn, L.; Ryan, D.; Keane, N.; McAuliffe, E.",HRB Open Res,97,13

Subsequently, the remedē System was approved by FDA in 2017. As a condition of approval, the Post Approval Study (PAS) collected clinical evidence regarding long-term safety and effectiveness in adults with moderate to severe CSA through five years post implant. Methods: Patients remaining in the Pivotal Trial at the time of FDA approval were invited to enroll in the PAS and consented to undergo sleep studies (scored by a central laboratory), complete the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaire to assess daytime sleepiness, and safety assessment. All subjects (treatment and former control group) receiving active therapy were pooled;data from both trials were combined for analysis. Results: Fifty-three of the original 151 Pivotal Trial patients consented to participate in the PAS and 52 completed the 5-year visit. Following TPNS therapy, the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), central-apnea index (CAI), arousal index, oxygen desaturation index, and sleep architecture showed sustained improvements. Comparing 5 years to baseline, AHI and CAI decreased significantly (AHI baseline median 46 events/hour vs 17 at 5 years;CAI baseline median 23 events/hour vs 1 at 5 years), though residual hypopneas were present. In parallel, the arousal index, oxygen desaturation index and sleep architecture improved. The ESS improved by a statistically significant median reduction of 3 points at 5 years. Serious adverse events related to implant procedure, device or delivered therapy were reported by 14% of patients which include 16 (9%) patients who underwent a pulse generator reposition or lead revision (primarily in the first year). None of the events caused long-term harm. No unanticipated adverse device effects or related deaths occurred through 5 years. Conclusion: Long-term TPNS safely improves CSA, sleep architecture and daytime sleepiness through 5 years post implant.

Hemodialysis patients are already at an increased risk for thromboembolic events such as stroke and pulmonary embolism. The aim of our study was to determine the incidence of late thrombotic complications (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, new-onset vascular access thrombosis) in maintenance hemodialysis patients after recovery from COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 200 prevalent hemodialysis patients in our center at the start of the pandemic. We excluded incident patients after the cohort entry date and those who required hemodialysis for acute kidney injury, and excluded patients with less than 1 month follow-up due to kidney transplantation or death from non-thrombotic causes. FINDINGS: One-hundred and eighty five prevalent hemodialysis patients finally met the inclusion criteria; 37 patients (17.6%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection, out of which 10 (27%) died during the acute phase of disease without evidence of thrombotic events. There was an increased risk of thrombotic events in COVID-19 survivors compared to the non-infected cohort (18.5% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.002) after a median follow-up of 7 months. Multivariate regression analysis showed that COVID-19 infection increased risk for late thrombotic events adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, antithrombotic treatment, and previous thrombotic events (Odds Ratio (OR) 26.4, 95% confidence interval 2.5-280.6, p = 0.01). Clinical and laboratory markers did not predict thrombotic events. CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased risk of late thrombotic complications in hemodialysis patients after infection with COVID-19. Further studies should evaluate the benefit of prolonged prophylactic anticoagulation in hemodialysis patients after recovery from COVID-19.","Shabaka, Amir; Gruss, Enrique; Landaluce-Triska, Eugenia; Gallego-Valcarce, Eduardo; Cases-Corona, Clara; Ocaña, Javier; Tato-Ribera, Ana; Lopez-Revuelta, Katia; Furaz-Czerpak, Karina R; Fernández-Juárez, Gema",Hemodial. int,97,24

METHODS: About 202 severe asthmatics were studied after 12-120 months of step-5 treatment associated to anti-IgE therapy. Following treatments, reversibility tests, after inhaling 400 mcg of Salbutamol, were performed. FEV1 > 12% or &#8804;12% changes differentiated RAO+ from RAO- subjects. Blood eosinophil (BE) counts after treatment were considered. RESULTS: Pre-/post-treatment bronchodilator FEV1 % and ACT were lower (61% [50-71], 74.4% [62.5-83.7] and 20[18-22]), whereas BE were higher (380 cells/µl [170-590]) in RAO+ compared to RAO- subjects (77% [64-88], p = 0.0001, 81.8% [66.1-94.3], p = 0.0001, 21[18-23], p = 0.045 and 230 cells/µl [80-360], p = 0.003). A negative relationship between SABA-induced FEV1 % changes and pre-bronchodilator FEV1 % (ß = -0.551%; p = 0.0001) and ACT (ß = -0.059; p = 0.038) was found. Conversely, post-treatment BE levels were positively related (ß = 145.565 cells/µl; p = 0.003) to FEV1 > 12% increases. A rising trend of pre-/post-bronchodilator FEV1 % in time was observed in RAO- subjects with BE < 300 cells/µl. Conversely, we highlighted significant declining tendencies of pre/post-bronchodilator FEV1 % in RAO+ patients with BE > 300 cells/µl reaching lower values after more than 36 months of step-5 treatment (59.6% [39.9-72.1] vs 74[66.5-89.2] of RAO+ individuals with BE < 300 cells/µl [p = 0.026] and 81.6% [66.1-91.8] of RAO-subjects with BE > 300 cells/µl [p = 0.009]). CONCLUSION: Persistent SABA-induced FEV1 > 12%, especially when associated to BE > 300 cells/ml, may be a marker of accelerated lung function decline in severe asthmatics despite maximal step-5 treatment. The highest bronchodilation associated to the lowest BE levels should be the main goal of asthma treatment to prevent such decline.","Sposato, Bruno; Scalese, Marco; Ricci, Alberto; Rogliani, Paola; Paggiaro, Pierluigi",Clin Respir J,97,23

METHOD: Descriptive and correlational analyses were used to examine the frequency of past 7-day adherence to each of 10 guidelines, as well as overall adherence. Guided by a disposition-belief-motivation model of health behavior, path analyses tested associations of personality traits and demographic factors to overall adherence via perceived norms, perceived control, attitudes, and self-efficacy related to guideline adherence, as well as perceived exposure risk and perceived health consequence if exposed. RESULTS: Adherence ranged from 94.4% reporting always avoiding eating/drinking inside bars/restaurants/food courts to 13.6% reporting always avoiding touching one's face. Modeling showed total associations with overall adherence for greater conscientiousness (ß = .191, p < .001), openness (ß = .098, p < .05), perceptions of social endorsement (ß = .202, p < .001), positive attitudes (ß = .105, p < .05), self-efficacy (ß = .234, p < .001), and the presence versus absence or uncertainty of a shelter-in-place order (ß = .102, p < .01). Age, self-rated health, sex, education, income, children in the household, agreeableness, extraversion, neuroticism, perceived exposure risk, and perceived health consequence showed null-to-negligible associations with overall adherence. CONCLUSIONS: The results clarify adherence frequency, highlight characteristics associated with greater adherence, and suggest the need to strengthen the social contract between government and citizenry by clearly communicating adherence benefits, costs, and timelines.

During decision-making, policymakers consider an estimate of the effective reproduction number Rt, which is the expected number of secondary infections spread by a single infected individual. OBJECTIVE: We propose a simple method for estimating the time-varying infection rate and the Rt. METHODS: We used a sliding window approach with a Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) model. We estimated the infection rate from the reported cases over a 7-day window to obtain a continuous estimation of Rt. A proposed adaptive SIR (aSIR) model was applied to analyze the data at the state and county levels. RESULTS: The aSIR model showed an excellent fit for the number of reported COVID-19 cases, and the 1-day forecast mean absolute prediction error was <2.6% across all states. However, the 7-day forecast mean absolute prediction error approached 16.2% and strongly overestimated the number of cases when the Rt was rapidly decreasing. The maximal Rt displayed a wide range of 2.0 to 4.5 across all states, with the highest values for New York (4.4) and Michigan (4.5). We found that the aSIR model can rapidly adapt to an increase in the number of tests and an associated increase in the reported cases of infection. Our results also suggest that intensive testing may be an effective method of reducing Rt. CONCLUSIONS: The aSIR model provides a simple and accurate computational tool for continuous Rt estimation and evaluation of the efficacy of mitigation measures.","Shapiro, Mark B; Karim, Fazle; Muscioni, Guido; Augustine, Abel Saju",J Med Internet Res,97,20

However, only recently COVID-19 confinement measures provided a context to test whether such detrimental effects exist in the human sexuality domain. AIM: This study was aimed at testing the relationship between COVID-19 confinement levels and sexual functioning domains in men and women, while accounting for the mediating role of psychological adjustment during lockdown. METHODS: Two hundred and forty five men and 417 women completed a web survey on the effects of COVID-19 in sexual health. The reference period includes the first confinement in Portugal (March 19-June 1, 2020). Data were handled under Hays' procedures for simple mediation analysis. OUTCOMES: Measurement outcomes included self-reported levels of confinement, IIEF and FSFI scores, and psychological adjustment during lockdown. RESULTS: Psychological adjustment during lockdown mediated the relationship between confinement levels and most sexual functioning domains in men but not in women. Also, while confinement levels were not directly related with most sexual functioning domains, psychological adjustment during lockdown did predict lower sexual functioning in both genders. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: Findings support that human sexual functioning should be framed within a contextual perspective, emphasizing how psychological adjustment and situational life stressors, such as lockdown situations, shape individuals' sexuality. Such perspective should be considered in treatment protocols implemented during current pandemic. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Data add to the literature on the effects of lockdown in the sexuality domain. However, the study precludes inference of causality and targets only a little proportion of all the dynamics involved in sexuality during the current historical moment.

Then, by combining advantages of the U-model control and the extended state observer (ESO), an extended state observer-based U-model control (ESOUC) is proposed to generate a population restriction policy. Closed-loop stability of the regulation system is also proved Two examples are considered, and numerical simulation results show that the ESOUC can suppress the COVID-19 faster than the linear active disturbance rejection control, which benefits controlling the infectious disease and the economic recovery.

Self-reported smell or taste impairment was prospectively evaluated by SNOT-22 at diagnosis, 4-week, 8-week, and 6-month. At 6 months from the diagnosis, psychophysical evaluation of olfactory function was also performed using the 34-item culturally adapted University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (CA-UPSIT). 145 completed both the 6-month subjective and psychophysical olfactory evaluation. According to CA-UPSIT, 87 subjects (60.0%) exhibited some smell dysfunction, with 10 patients being anosmic (6.9%) and 7 being severely microsmic (4.8%). At the time CA-UPSIT was administered, a weak correlation was observed between the self-reported alteration of sense of smell or taste and olfactory test scores (Spearman's r=-0.26). Among 112 patients who self-reported normal sense of smell at last follow-up, CA-UPSIT revealed normal smell in 46 (41.1%), mild microsmia in 46 (41.1%), moderate microsmia in 11 (9.8%), severe microsmia in 3 (2.3%), and anosmia in 6 (5.4%) patients; however, of those patients self-reporting normal smell but who were found to have hypofunction on testing, 62 out of 66 had self-reported reduction in sense of smell or taste at an earlier time point. Despite most patients report a subjectively normal sense of smell, we observed a high percentage of persistent smell dysfunction at 6 months from the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 11.7% of patients being anosmic or severely microsmic.

Events like the COVID-19 pandemic put an exceptional burden upon ICT. This involves increasing implementation and use of data centers, which increased energy use and environmental impact. The scope of this work is to summarize the present situation on data centers as to environmental impact and opportunities for improvement. First, we introduce the topic, presenting estimated energy use and emissions. Then, we review proposed strategies for energy efficiency and conservation in data centers. Energy uses pertain to power distribution, ICT, and non-ICT equipment (e.g., cooling). Existing and prospected strategies and initiatives in these sectors are identified. Among key elements are innovative cooling techniques, natural resources, automation, low-power electronics, and equipment with extended thermal limits. Research perspectives are identified and estimates of improvement opportunities are mentioned.

This approach has several drawbacks, stemming from biases or lack of availability of data and instability of parameter estimates. Here we take the opposite approach -- that we call reverse epidemiology. Given the data, we reconstruct backward in time an ensemble of networks of contacts, and we assess the impact of measures on that specific realization of the contagion process. This approach is robust because it only depends on parameters that describe the evolution of the disease within one individual (e.g. latency time) and not on parameters that describe the spread of the epidemics in a population. Using this method, we assess the impact of preventive quarantine on the ongoing outbreak of Covid-19 in Italy. This gives an estimate of how many infected could have been avoided had preventive quarantine been enforced at a given time.","Grilli, Jacopo; Marsili, Matteo; Sanguinetti, Guido",,97,16

Recent data are showing significant prevalence of arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) among patients with COVID-19, which raised many questions about higher susceptibility of patients with these comorbidities to the novel coronavirus, as well as the role of hypertension and CVD in progression and the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. There is a very limited amount of data, usually obtained from a small population, regarding the effect of the underlying disease on the outcome in patients with COVID-19. The evaluation of the treatment of these comorbidities at baseline and during COVID-19 is scarce and the results are conflicting. Hypertension and CVD, after the adjustment for other clinical and demographic parameters, primarily age, did not remain independent predictors of the lethal outcome in COVID-19 patients. Some investigations speculated about the association between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and susceptibility to COVID-19, as well as the relationship between RAAS inhibitors and the adverse outcome in these patients. Withdrawing or switching RAAS inhibitors would have uncertain benefits, but it would definitely have many disadvantages such as uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac function deterioration and renal function impairment, which could potentially induce more complications in patients with COVID-19 than the infection of coronavirus itself. The aim of this review article was to summarize the prevalence of hypertension and CVD in patients with COVID-19, their influence on the outcome and the effect of treatment of hypertension and CVD in COVID-19 patients.","Tadic, Marijana; Cuspidi, Cesare; Mancia, Giuseppe; Dell039,; Oro, Raffaella; Grassi, Guido",Pharmacol Res,97,22

Here, we report a 382-nucleotide (nt) deletion in SARS-CoV-2 that truncates open reading frame 7b (ORF7b) and ORF8, removing the ORF8 transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) and eliminating ORF8 transcription. The earliest 382-nt deletion variant was detected in Singapore on 29 January 2020, with the deletion viruses circulating in the country and accounting for 23.6% (45/191) of SARS-CoV-2 samples screened in this study. SARS-CoV-2 with the same deletion has since been detected in Taiwan, and other ORF7b/8 deletions of various lengths, ranging from 62 nt to 345 nt, have been observed in other geographic locations, including Australia, Bangladesh, and Spain. Mutations or deletions in ORF8 of SARS-CoV have been associated with reduced replicative fitness and virus attenuation. In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 382-nt deletion viruses showed significantly higher replicative fitness in vitro than the wild type, while no difference was observed in patient viral load, indicating that the deletion variant viruses retained their replicative fitness. A robust antibody response to ORF8 has been observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the emergence of ORF8 deletions may be due to immune-driven selection and that further deletion variants may emerge during the sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in humans.IMPORTANCE During the SARS epidemic in 2003/2004, a number of deletions were observed in ORF8 of SARS-CoV, and eventually deletion variants became predominant, leading to the hypothesis that ORF8 was an evolutionary hot spot for adaptation of SARS-CoV to humans. However, due to the successful control of the SARS epidemic, the importance of these deletions for the epidemiological fitness of SARS-CoV in humans could not be established. The emergence of multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains with ORF8 deletions, combined with evidence of a robust immune response to ORF8, suggests that the lack of ORF8 may assist with host immune evasion. In addition to providing a key insight into the evolutionary behavior of SARS-CoV-2 as the virus adapts to its new human hosts, the emergence of ORF8 deletion variants may also impact vaccination strategies.","Su, Yvonne C F; Anderson, Danielle E; Young, Barnaby E; Linster, Martin; Zhu, Feng; Jayakumar, Jayanthi; Zhuang, Yan; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Low, Jenny G H; Tan, Chee Wah; Chia, Wan Ni; Mak, Tze Minn; Octavia, Sophie; Chavatte, Jean-Marc; Lee, Raphael T C; Pada, Surinder; Tan, Seow Yen; Sun, Louisa; Yan, Gabriel Z; Maurer-Stroh, Sebastian; Mendenhall, Ian H; Leo, Yee-Sin; Lye, David Chien; Wang, Lin-Fa; Smith, Gavin J D",mBio (Online),97,1

These include two mutations in the N terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein, HV69-70del and Y144del (also known as Y145del due to the presence of tyrosine at both positions). We recently identified several emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns, characterized by Membrane (M) protein mutations, including I82T and V70L. We now identify a sub-lineage of B.1.1.7 that emerged through sequential acquisitions of M:V70L in November 2020 followed by a novel S:D178H mutation first observed in early February 2021. The percentage of B.1.1.7 isolates in the US that belong to this sub-lineage increased from 0.15% in February 2021 to 1.8% in April 2021. To date, this sub-lineage appears to be U.S.-specific with reported cases in 31 states, including Hawaii. As of April 2021, it constituted 36.8% of all B.1.1.7 isolates in Washington. Phylogenetic analysis and transmission inference with Nextstrain suggest this sub-lineage likely originated in either California or Washington. Structural analysis revealed that the S:D178H mutation is in the NTD of the S protein and close to two other signature mutations of B.1.1.7, HV69-70del and Y144del. It is surface exposed and may alter NTD tertiary configuration or accessibility, and thus has the potential to affect neutralization by NTD directed antibodies.","Shen, Lishuang; Bard, Jennifer Dien; Triche, Timothy J; Judkins, Alexander R; Biegel, Jaclyn A; Gai, Xiaowu",Emerg Microbes Infect,97,20

Serological assays detecting IgG against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein are useful to monitor the immune response after infection or vaccination. The objective of our study was to evaluate the clinical performance of the Siemens SARS-CoV-2 IgG (sCOVG) assay. METHODS: Sensitivity and specificity of the Siemens sCOVG test were evaluated on 178 patients with SARS-CoV-2-infection and 160 pre-pandemic samples in comparison with its predecessor test COV2G. Furthermore, correlation with virus neutralization titers was investigated on 134 samples of convalescent COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Specificity of the sCOVG test was 99.4% and sensitivity was 90.5% (COV2G assay 78.7%; p<0.0001). S1-RBD antibody levels showed a good correlation with virus neutralization titers (r=0.843; p<0.0001) and an overall qualitative agreement of 98.5%. Finally, median S1-RBD IgG levels increase with age and were significantly higher in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (median levels general ward: 25.7 U/mL; intensive care: 59.5 U/mL) than in outpatients (3.8 U/mL; p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Performance characteristics of the sCOVG assay have been improved compared to the predecessor test COV2G. Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD IgG levels could be used as a surrogate for virus neutralization capacity. Further harmonization of antibody quantification might assist to monitor the humoral immune response after COVID-19 disease or vaccination.","Irsara, Christian; Egger, Alexander E; Prokop, Wolfgang; Nairz, Manfred; Loacker, Lorin; Sahanic, Sabina; Pizzini, Alex; Sonnweber, Thomas; Holzer, Barbara; Mayer, Wolfgang; Schennach, Harald; Loeffler-Ragg, Judith; Bellmann-Weiler, Rosa; Hartmann, Boris; Tancevski, Ivan; Weiss, Günter; Binder, Christoph J; Anliker, Markus; Griesmacher, Andrea; Hoermann, Gregor",Clin. chem. lab. med,97,1

The aim of this study was to describe the impact on clinical practice of sequential preoperative screening for COVID-19-infection in deciding whether to proceed or postpone surgery. Methods: Prospective, cohort study, based on consecutive patients’ candidates for an oncological surgical intervention. Sequential preoperative screening for COVID-19-infection: two-time medical history (telematic and face-to-face), PCR and chest CT, 48 h before of surgical intervention. COVID-19-infection was considered positive if the patient had a suggestive medical history and/or PCR-positive and/or CT of pneumonia. Results: Between April 15th and May 4th, 2020, 179 patients were studied, 97 were male (54%), mean (sd) age 66.7 (13,6). Sequential preoperative screening was performed within 48 h before to surgical intervention. The prevalence of preoperative COVID-19-infection was 4.5%, 95%CI:2.3–8.6% (8 patients). Of the operated patients (171), all had a negative medical history, PCR and chest CT. The complications was 14.8% (I-II) and 2.5% (III-IV). There was no mortality. The hospital stay was 3.1 (sd 2.7) days. In the 8 patients with COVID-19-infection, the medical history was suggestive in all of them, 7 presented PCR-positive and 5 had a chest CT suggestive of pneumonia. The surgical intervention was postponed between 15 and 21 days. Conclusion: Preoperative screening for COVID-19-infection using medical history and PCR helped the surgeon to decide whether to go ahead or postpone surgery in oncological patients. The chest CT may be useful in unclear cases.","Castellvi, J.; Jerico, C.; DeMiguel, A.; Camacho, D.; Mullerat, J. M.; Catala, J.; Cliville, R.; Videla, S.",Intl. J. Surg.,97,13

We also confirm that the M-334 site and NS-234/236 sites are critical for TRA2A binding, mRNA splicing, viral replication, and pathogenicity. Our results reveal the underlying mechanisms of adaptation of avian influenza virus to human hosts, and suggest rational strategies to protect public health.","Zhu, Yinxing; Wang, Ruifang; Yu, Luyao; Sun, Huimin; Tian, Shan; Li, Peng; Jin, Meilin; Chen, Huanchun; Ma, Wenjun; Zhou, Hongbo",Sci.

Improving predictive accuracy is therefore extremely valuable. Data science researchers design algorithms, models, and approaches to improve prediction. Prediction is also improved with larger and richer data. Beyond improving algorithms and data, platforms can stealthily achieve better prediction accuracy by""pushing""users' behaviors towards their predicted values, using behavior modification techniques, thereby demonstrating more certain predictions. Such apparent""improved""prediction can unintentionally result from employing reinforcement learning algorithms that combine prediction and behavior modification. This strategy is absent from the machine learning and statistics literature. Investigating its properties requires integrating causal with predictive notation. To this end, we incorporate Pearl's causal do(.) operator into the predictive vocabulary. We then decompose the expected prediction error given behavior modification, and identify the components impacting predictive power. Our derivation elucidates implications of such behavior modification to data scientists, platforms, their customers, and the humans whose behavior is manipulated. Behavior modification can make users' behavior more predictable and even more homogeneous; yet this apparent predictability might not generalize when customers use predictions in practice. Outcomes pushed towards their predictions can be at odds with customers' intentions, and harmful to manipulated users.","Shmueli, Galit; Tafti, Ali",,97,16

Methods: In this multicenter prospective cohort study, HCWs from frontline departments were included in March and April 2020 and followed for 3 months. SARS-CoV-2 serology was performed at month 0 (M0), M1, and M3 and RT-PCR in case of symptoms. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3. Risk factors of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3 were identified by multivariate logistic regression. Results: Among 1,062 HCWs (median [interquartile range] age, 33 [28-42] years; 758 [71.4%] women; 321 [30.2%] physicians), the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3 was 14.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] [12.5; 16.9]). Risk factors were the working department specialty, with increased risk for intensive care units (odds ratio 1.80, 95%CI [0.38; 8.58]), emergency departments (3.91 [0.83; 18.43]) and infectious diseases departments (4.22 [0.92; 18.28]); active smoking was associated with reduced risk (0.36 [0.21; 0.63]). Age, sex, professional category, number of years of experience in the job or department, and public transportation use were not significantly associated with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3. Conclusion: The rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in frontline HCWs was 14.6% at the end of the first COVID-19 wave in Paris and occurred mainly early. The study argues for an origin of professional in addition to private life contamination and therefore including HCWs in the first-line vaccination target population.

Indicators of poor prognosis are important in the treatment and follow-up of COVID-19 patients and have always been a matter of interest to researchers. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between frontal QRS-T angle values and clinical severity and prognosis in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This prospective case-control study was conducted with 130 COVID-19 patients whose diagnosis was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 100 healthy controls. The CURB-65 score was used as the clinical severity score. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients and 100 healthy controls were included in the study. When the patient and control groups were compared a significant difference was found between QT (378.07 ± 33.75 vs. 368.63 ± 19.65, p < 0.001), QTc (410.79 ± 28.19 vs. 403.68 ± 11.70, p < 0.001), QRS time (95.04 ± 21.67 vs. 91.42 ± 11.08, p < 0.001) and frontal QRS-T angle (36.57 ± 22.86 vs. 22.72 ± 14.08, p < 0.001). According to clinical severity scoring, QT (370.27 ± 25.20 vs. 387.75 ± 40.19, p = 0.003), QTc (402.18 ± 19.92 vs. 421.48 ± 33.08, p < 0.001), frontal QRS-T angle (32.25 ± 18.79 vs. 41.94 ± 26.27), p = 0.0.16) parameters were found to be significantly different. Age (odds ratio [OR], 1.201; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.111–1.298; p < 0.001) and frontal QRS-T angle ([OR], 1.045; 95% [CI], 1.015–1.075; p = 0.003) values were found to be an independent predictor for the severity of the disease. Frontal QRS-T angle ([OR], 1.101; 95% [CI], 1.030–1.176; p = 0.004), and CRP ([OR], 1.029; 95% [CI], 1.007–1.051; p = 0.01) parameters were found to be independent predictors for the mortality of the disease. As a mortality indicator; for the frontal QRS-T angle of ≥44.5°, specificity and sensitivity were 93.8% and 84.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Frontal QRS-T angle can be used as a reproducible, convenient, inexpensive, new and powerful predictor in determining the clinical severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.","Ocak, Metin; Tascanov, Mustafa Begenc; Yurt, Nur Şimşek; Yurt, Yusuf Can",Am J Emerg Med,97,20

This study on 823 female attorneys in China identifies employee creative self-efficacy and employees’ value of Zhongyong as moderators in this relationship. In this study, work stress is assessed by the perceived work uncertainty brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study found that although Zhongyong, which involves an employee’s ambidextrous thinking, can be helpful for employee creativity, low levels of Zhongyong are better for employee creativity in an uncertain context such as the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the fact that high levels of Zhongyong result in an overemphasis on compromise and giving in when times are uncertain. Instead, low levels of Zhongyong will decrease employees’ concern about others’ acceptance in an uncertain environment. In addition, creative self-efficacy motivates employees to engage in creative efforts during times of work uncertainty. In sum, this study found that employee perceived work uncertainty brought on by COVID-19 enhances employee creativity when an employee’s value of Zhongyong is low and creative self-efficacy is high.","Tang, Chaoying; Ma, Huijuan; Naumann, Stefanie E.; Xing, Ziwei",Front Psychol,97,33

This paper focuses on the incidence of the disease in Italy and Spain—two of the first and most affected European countries. Using two simple mathematical epidemiological models—the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model and the log-linear regression model, we model the daily and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the two countries during the early stage of the outbreak, and compute estimates for basic measures of the infectiousness of the disease including the basic reproduction number, growth rate, and doubling time. Estimates of the basic reproduction number were found to be larger than 1 in both countries, with values being between 2 and 3 for Italy, and 2.5 and 4 for Spain. Estimates were also computed for the more dynamic effective reproduction number, which showed that since the first cases were confirmed in the respective countries the severity has generally been decreasing. The predictive ability of the log-linear regression model was found to give a better fit and simple estimates of the daily incidence for both countries were computed.","Chu, Jeffrey",PLoS One,97,11

Emerging evidence has implicated extracellular vesicles (EVs), a key intercellular communicator, in the pathogenesis and treatment of COVID‐19. In the pathogenesis of COVID‐19, cells that express ACE2 and CD9 can transfer these viral receptors to other cells via EVs, making recipient cells more susceptible for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Once infected, cells release EVs packaged with viral particles that further facilitate viral spreading and immune evasion, aggravating COVID‐19 and its complications. In contrast, EVs derived from stem cells, especially mesenchymal stromal/stem cells, alleviate severe inflammation (cytokine storm) and repair damaged lung cells in COVID‐19 by delivery of anti‐inflammatory molecules. These therapeutic beneficial EVs can also be engineered into drug delivery platforms or vaccines to fight against COVID‐19. Therefore, EVs from diverse sources exhibit distinct effects in regulating viral infection, immune response, and tissue damage/repair, functioning as a double‐edged sword in COVID‐19. Here, we summarize the recent progress in understanding the pathological roles of EVs in COVID‐19. A comprehensive discussion of the therapeutic effects/potentials of EVs is also provided.","Xia, Xiaohuan; Yuan, Ping; Liu, Yihan; Wang, Yi; Cao, Weijun; Zheng, Jialin C.",Immunology,97,24

To achieve this goal, students should be knowledgeable and competent in infection control practice before proceeding to their training hospitals. OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the nursing students' perception of the infection prevention climate in training hospitals in Saudi Arabia. It also examined the predictors of the students' perceptions. DESIGN: A quantitative, cross-sectional design was used. METHODS: This investigation was part of a large study conducted in six Saudi universities. A total of 829 Saudi nursing students were included in this study. Data were collected using the Leading Culture of Quality in Infection Prevention scale and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Ethical approval was obtained from the King Saud University, and permission was given by the administration of each participating university. RESULTS: The overall perception of nursing students indicated a modest infection prevention climate. Prioritization of quality and improvement orientation was rated as the highest dimensions, whereas psychological safety and supportive environment were the lowest. The nursing students in University F had the poorest perceptions among the six universities. The predictors of nursing student perception of their training hospitals' infection prevention climates were the university where they studied, their age, and participation in infection prevention seminars. CONCLUSIONS: This article describes nursing students' perception of the infection prevention climate of their training hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Results may provide a unique theoretical underpinning on the perception and factors that effect an infection prevention climate. Thereby, previous knowledge and literature may be expanded. Results can be used as a guide in establishing clinical policies in efforts toward improving the infection prevention climate.","Tumala, Regie B.; Almazan, Joseph; Alabdulaziz, Hawa; Felemban, Ebaa Marwan; Alsolami, Fatmah; Alquwez, Nahed; Alshammari, Farhan; Tork, Hanan M.M.; Cruz, Jonas Preposi",Nurse Educ Today,97,22

Although emergency medicine (EM) residents are trained in POCUS, Thai medical students receive limited training. An introductory POCUS course was implemented for medical students to prepare them for internships. OBJECTIVE: This study described the perception and use of POCUS by graduates of an introductory POCUS course. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical students who completed the POCUS course were surveyed during their intern year from 2012 to 2015. The survey collected demographic characteristics. The Likert Scale was used to assess POCUS practice patterns and perceptions of the course. RESULTS: There were 230 respondents (98% response rate). All thought that POCUS was important. Furthermore, 96% of respondents felt that the POCUS course meaningfully impacted their ability to deliver care. POCUS use was greatest for obstetrics/gynecology and trauma cases. Over half of respondents (55.2%) felt very confident with using extended-Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma. Most respondents (81.8%) were positively impacted by the course, and 61.7% were satisfied with the scope of the course. Recommendations for improvement included increasing the course length, the content, and the hands-on time for POCUS practice. CONCLUSION: Graduates positively perceived the course and felt it dramatically impacted their clinical practice as novice physicians. An introductory POCUS course should be incorporated into the medical school curriculum to prepare graduates for practice. Future goals include increasing the scope of POCUS practice to help guide interns and residents in emergency patient care such as lung ultrasound in COVID-19 or pneumonia patients and studying the impact this course has on patient outcomes.","Vanichkulbodee, Alissara; Inboriboon, Pholaphat Charles; Balk, Andrew H; Sri-on, Jiraporn",Open Access Emerg Med,97,20

We observed higher levels of CCC reactive T cells in SARS-CoV-2 seronegative HCW compared to community donors, consistent with potential higher occupational exposure of HCW to CCC. We further show that SARS-CoV-2 T cell reactivity of seronegative HCW was higher than community controls and correlation between CCC and SARS-CoV-2 responses is consistent with cross-reactivity and not associated with recent in vivo activation. Surprisingly, CCC T cell reactivity was decreased in SARS-CoV-2 infected HCW, suggesting that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 might interfere with CCC responses, either directly or indirectly.

In this research, a moving train test and a Gaussian puff model were employed to investigate the impact of wind raised by a train running on the transmission and dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 from infected individuals. Our findings suggest that the 2 m social distance guideline may not be enough; under train-induced wind action, human respiratory disease-carrier droplets may travel to unexpected places. However, there are deficiencies in passenger safety guidelines and it is necessary to improve the quantitative research in the relationship between train-induced wind and virus transmission.

Other important biological activities including accelerating tissue repair and modulating host immunity to infection and cancer via the innate and adaptive immune systems are reported in pre-clinical models but incompletely studied in humans. OBJECTIVE: Assess safety and efficacy of sargramostim in cancer and other diverse experimental and clinical settings. METHODS AND RESULTS: We systematically reviewed PubMed, Cochrane and TRIP databases for clinical data on sargramostim in cancer. In a variety of settings, sargramostim after exposure to bone marrow-suppressing agents accelerated hematologic recovery resulting in fewer infections, less therapy-related toxicity and sometimes improved survival. As an immune modulator, sargramostim also enhanced anti-cancer responses in solid cancers when combined with conventional therapies, for example with immune checkpoint inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Sargramostim accelerates hematologic recovery in diverse clinical settings and enhances anti-cancer responses with a favorable safety profile. Uses other than in hematologic recovery are less-well studied; more data are needed on immune-enhancing benefits. We envision significantly expanded use of sargramostim in varied immune settings. Sargramostim has the potential to reverse the immune suppression associated with sepsis, trauma, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19. Further, sargramostim therapy has been promising in the adjuvant setting with vaccines and for anti-microbial-resistant infections and treating autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and gastrointestinal, peripheral arterial and neuro-inflammatory diseases. It also may be useful as an adjuvant in anti-cancer immunotherapy.","Lazarus, Hillard M.; Ragsdale, Carolyn E.; Gale, Robert Peter; Lyman, Gary H.",Front Immunol,97,8

This report describes the Virtual Resus Room (VRR)-a free, novel, open access resource for running collaborative online simulations. APPROACH: The lead author created the VRR in May 2020 to give learners the opportunity to rehearse their crisis resource management skills by working as a team to complete virtual tasks. The VRR uses Google Slides to link participants to the virtual environment and Zoom to link participants to each other. Students and facilitators in the emergency medicine clerkship at McMaster University used the VRR to run 2 cases between June and August 2020. Students and facilitators completed a post-session survey to assess usability and acceptability, applicability for learning or teaching, and fidelity. In addition, students took a knowledge test pre- and post-session. OUTCOMES: Forty-six students and 11 facilitators completed the post-session surveys. Facilitators and students rated the VRR's usability and acceptability, applicability for learning and teaching, and fidelity highly. Students showed a significant improvement in their post-session (mean = 89.06, standard deviation [SD] = 9.56) compared to their pre-session knowledge scores (mean = 71.17, SD = 15.77; t(34) = 7.28, P < .001, with a large effect size Cohen's d = 1.23). Two perceived learning outcomes were identified: content learning and communication skills development.

Here, we examined the association between cannabis use history and an especially topical health-behavior, willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: COVID-19 vaccine willingness was surveyed in a subset of participants from the Tulsa 1000 Study, which is a longitudinal study of psychiatric treatment-seeking and healthy control participants. We identified 45 participants who completed a COVID-19 vaccine questionnaire and reported more than 10 lifetime cannabis uses. Those participants were compared to a group of 45 individuals with very light (<10) cannabis use histories who were propensity score-matched on age, sex, income, and race. Two-group t-tests and Bayes factor analysis on vaccine willingness were conducted between groups. Exploratory correlation analyses were conducted on vaccine willingness and lifetime cannabis use levels within the cannabis group only. RESULTS: Vaccine willingness did not differ between the two groups (t(88)=0.33, p=.74; BF(01)=4.3). However, a negative correlation was identified within the cannabis group, such that higher lifetime cannabis use histories correlated with less willingness to receive a vaccine (rho(43)= −.33, p=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Although vaccine willingness did not differ between the two matched groups, preliminary evidence suggests that heavy lifetime cannabis use might indicate a reluctance to engage in health-promoting behaviors like receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.","Spechler, Philip A.; Stewart, Jennifer L.; Kuplicki, Rayus; Paulus, Martin P.",medRxiv,97,3

We identify an inflammatory ‘cytokine-storm’, a cocktail of interferon gamma, interleukin 1β and poly(I:C), induced diastolic dysfunction. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 is activated along with a viral response that is consistent in both human cardiac organoids and hearts of SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-hACE2 mice. Bromodomain and extraterminal family inhibitors (BETi) recover dysfunction in hCO and completely prevent cardiac dysfunction and death in a mouse cytokine-storm model.

The presentation is typically preceded by five or more days of fever with additional clinical findings including rash, peripheral edema, mucositis, conjunctival changes, and unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. The most feared complication of Kawasaki disease is development of coronary artery aneurysms. Common laboratory abnormalities include normocytic anemia, thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, and elevated inflammatory markers. Immune-mediated cytopenias such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia are rarely seen at presentation in Kawasaki disease. We describe a unique case of a child presenting with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, who sequentially developed immune thrombocytopenia concerning for Evans' syndrome and eventually diagnosed with Kawasaki Disease with coronary artery dilatation. Characteristic clinical findings including extremity edema, cracked lips, and rash developed later in the course. Our patient was treated with IVIG and steroids with significant clinical improvement and complete resolution of cytopenias and coronary aneurysms on long term follow up. Timely administration of IVIG prevents and minimizes the risk of long term cardiac consequences.

By now, it is clear that the number of people infected is much greater than the number of reported cases. To estimate the infected but undetected/unreported cases using a mathematical model, we can use a parameter called the probability of quarantining an infected individual. This parameter exists in the time-delayed SEIQR model (Scientific Reports, article number: 3505). Here, two limiting cases of a network of such models are used to estimate the undetected population. The first limit corresponds to the network collapsing onto a single node and is referred to as the mean-[Formula: see text] model. In the second case, the number of nodes in the network is infinite and results in a continuum model wherein the infectivity is statistically distributed. We use a generalized Pareto distribution to model the infectivity. This distribution has a fat tail and models the presence of super-spreaders that contribute to the disease progression. While both models capture the detected numbers well, the predictions of affected numbers from the continuum model are more realistic. Our results suggest that affected people outnumber detected people by one to two orders of magnitude in Spain, the UK, Italy, and Germany. Our results are consistent with corresponding trends obtained from published serological studies in Spain, the UK and Italy.

Serology testing using ELISA proposes major advantages as a diagnostic and preventive tool to control the present SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. This cohort study was to determine the SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in asymptomatic cancer patients. METHODS: Patients in all age groups and with any type of cancer who have been in remission or have stable disease and received their latest anticancer therapy over 2 months ago included in the study. All patients were evaluated for COVID-19 symptoms and only asymptomatic patients were enrolled for serologic screening for SARS-CoV-2. Serum samples evaluated serologically for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: A total of 168 asymptomatic cancer patients were included in the study. Of the 168 cases with a history of cancer who were asymptomatic for Covid-19, 29 cases (17.26%) had a positive serological test. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, in the present study asymptomatic cancer patients revealed 17% seropositivity, approximately equal to the general population of the same age, sex, geographic region, and epidemic status. Asymptomatic infections should further be investigated and considered as playing an important role in the COVID-19 transmission chain.","Arab, Maliheh; Noei Teymoordash, Somayyeh; Talayeh, Maryam; Ghavami, Behnaz; Javadi, Abdolreza; Nouri, Behnaz",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,97,10

Many comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.67, 95% CI = 1.91–3.74) and hypertension (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.76–3.00), have been shown to worsen the patient’s condition. However, whether cardio-cerebrovascular disease will affect COVID-19 remains unclear. In this meta-analysis, we collected studies from PubMed, Wed of Science and CNKI (Chinese) to July 25, which reported COVID-19 patients with and without cardio-cerebrovascular disease as well as their severity and mortality. The random-effect model meta-analysis was used to analyze them and get overall odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs. Funnel plots and the Begg’s and Egger’s test were used to assess publication bias. Thirty-one studies with 23,632 patients were finally included in the meta-analysis. The results showed an OR of 3.004 (95% CI = 2.097–4.303) for COVID-19 severity and an OR of 5.587 (95% CI = 2.810–11.112) for COVID-19 mortality. Compared with cardiovascular disease, the subgroup analysis indicated that cerebrovascular disease was more likely to increase the severity (OR = 3.400, 95% CI = 1.569–7.368) and mortality (OR = 23.477, 95% CI = 3.050–180.735) of COVID-19. Therefore, it can be inferred that cardio-cerebrovascular disease is associated with an increase in the risk of severe illness and death among COVID-19 patients. This meta-analysis showed that cardio-cerebrovascular disease has a significant relation with severe and death outcomes of COVID-19. Nurses should pay special attention to COVID-19 patients with the cardio-cerebrovascular disease.","Yu, Jia-Ning; Wu, Bing-Bing; Yang, Jie; Lei, Xiao-Ling; Shen, Wang-Qin",Biol Res Nurs,97,1

Surgery remains the optimal treatment for the majority of oral malignancies, and primary reconstruction is often necessary to avoid significant morbidity as a result of ablative procedures. DESCRIPTION: The supraclavicular artery island flap (SCAIF) is increasingly finding a place as an alternative to free flap reconstruction of soft-tissue defects and has several specific advantages when compared to use of a soft-tissue free flap during the COVID-19 pandemic. It can be used for a range of head and neck defects. RESULTS: We describe our experience with the SCAIF during the pandemic in five patients with a variety of tumour types and locations. All five patients had a successful outcome with none requiring further reconstruction and all had a functional swallow postoperatively, including a patient who underwent a total pharyngeal reconstruction with a SCAIF. DISCUSSION: The use of a SCAIF during the current COVID-19 pandemic has significant advantages and is a reliable alternative to a soft tissue free flap.","Thompson, Alexandra; Khan, Zia; Patterson, Alan; Java, Kapil; Varley, Iain",J Maxillofac Oral Surg,97,20

The proposition that testing for salivary vitamin D can show a correlation with serum levels in healthy people is questionable, especially with low vitamin D intake. This study aimed to find the correlation between vitamin D levels, which were assessed as 25(OH)D and 1.25(OH)D in saliva, and serum 25(OH)D and 1.25(OH)D levels in people with low vitamin D intake. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional study involving healthy men and women, aged 18–60 years, carried out from August to November, 2020, in North Sumatra Province, Indonesia. The parameters studied were the 25(OH)D and 1.25(OH)D levels in saliva and serum, and vitamin D intake. The statistical analysis used was the Spearman correlation test, performed to determine the correlation between each parameter. RESULTS: This study involved 56 study subjects, who were rural adults (male or female) with a 78.6% deficiency in 25(OH)D found by examining saliva, and a 76.8% deficiency found by examining the serum. All of the subjects were categorized as having low vitamin D intake (less than 15 micrograms per day). The analysis showed a moderate correlation between levels of saliva 25(OH)D and serum 25(OH)D (p = 0.424), and a weak correlation between levels of saliva 1.25(OH)D and serum 25(OH)D (p = 0.339). CONCLUSION: In people with low vitamin D intake, there was a moderate correlation between serum 25(OH)D and saliva, but a weak correlation was found in the 1.25(OH)D assay. The use of saliva 25(OH)D levels to detect 25(OH)D in the circulation is a possible non-invasive alternative to serum testing.","Sari, Dina Keumala; Sari, Liza Meutia; Laksmi, Lidya Imelda; Farhat,",Int J Gen Med,97,31

In this context, the present study employed an in silico approach to assess the inhibitory potential of the phytochemicals obtained from GC-MS analysis of twelve Clerodendrum species against the imperative spike protein, main protease enzyme M(pro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2. An extensive molecular docking investigation of the phytocompounds at the active binding pockets of the viral proteins revealed promising inhibitory potential of the phytochemicals taraxerol, friedelin and stigmasterol. Decent physicochemical attributes of the compounds in accordance with Lipinski’s rule of five and Veber’s rule further established them as potential therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding free energy estimation revealed that taraxerol was the most promising candidate displaying the highest binding efficacy with all the concerned SARS-CoV-2 proteins included in the present analysis. Our observations were supported by robust molecular dynamics simulations of the complexes of the viral proteins with taraxerol for a timescale of 40 nanoseconds. It was striking to note that taraxerol exhibited better binding energy scores with the concerned viral proteins than the drugs that are specifically targeted against them. The present results promise to provide new avenues to further evaluate the potential of the phytocompound taraxerol in vitro and in vivo towards its successful deployment as a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor and combat the catastrophic COVID-19.

However, there is no data regarding its impact on access to health care of pwMS from Latin America. OBJECTIVES: We investigated and described changes in health care delivery for pwMS from Latin America during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: PwMS from 18 patient organizations of the region completed a web-based survey hosted from May to October 2020. RESULTS: A total of 602 pwMS completed the questionnaire. Changes in disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) use: 6.7% of pwMS on continuous DMTs claimed to stopped them; 14.1% of those on infusion therapies declared to postpone their dosing; 68.8% declared delaying the initiation of a DMT. Disruptions in accessing rehabilitation services were reported by 65.7%. Changes in laboratory and MRI monitoring were reported by 30% and 33%, respectively.

Our biolayer interferometry immunosorbent assay (BLI-ISA) utilizes single-use biosensors in an automated “dip-and-read” format, providing real-time optical measurements of antigen loading, plasma antibody binding, and antibody isotype detection. Complete semi-quantitative results are obtained in less than 20 min. BLI-ISA meets or exceeds the performance of high complexity methods such as Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Chemiluminescent Immunoassay. Importantly, our method can be immediately implemented on existing BLI platforms for urgent COVID-19 studies, such as serosurveillance and the evaluation of vaccine candidates. In a broader sense, BLI-ISA can be developed as a novel diagnostic platform to evaluate antibodies and other biomolecules in clinical specimens.","Dzimianski, John V.; Lorig-Roach, Nicholas; O’Rourke, Sara M.; Alexander, David L.; Kimmey, Jacqueline M.; DuBois, Rebecca M.",Sci Rep,97,33

Emphasizing the medical profession as a unique moral community characterized by ethical and professional commitments of service to patients, each other, and society, this paper offers guidance regarding physician suicide and the role of a healing community. The response to an individual physician suicide should be characterized by respect and concern for those who are grieving, the creation of a supportive environment for suicide loss survivors, and careful communication about the event. Because suicide is a complex problem, actions aimed at preventing suicide must occur at the individual, interpersonal, community, and societal levels.

The DFGs are here understood as generators of a more dialogic environment for girls in general and we wonder if and how It is extended to the context of girls with disabilities. Thus, the research takes the form of a case study with a communicative approach on a DFGs.

The data collection techniques consist of two in-depth interviews, analysis of the field diary of 24 intervention sessions and a focus group with seven teachers. It is demonstrated that DFGs are successfully transferred to the special education context of the case study.

By the beginning of March, WHO reported about 113,820,000 confirmed cases including more than 2,527,000 deaths all over the world. However, the true extent of virus circulation or its real infection/fatality ratio is not well-estimated due to the huge portion of asymptomatic infections. In this observational study, we have estimated the prevalence of specific immunoglobulin M and G directed towards SARS-CoV-2 antigen in a cohort of 1383 adult volunteers aged over 65 years old, living in the district of Benevento, in the South of Italy. Serological screening was carried out on capillary blood in September 2020, seven months after pandemic outbreak in Italy, to evaluate virus circulation and antibody response among elderly adults, in which severe symptoms due to viral infection are more common. The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 4.70% (CI 3.70%–5.95%) with no statistically significant differences between sexes. Among these, 69.69% (CI 55.61%–77.80%) tested positive to IgM, 23.08% (CI 14.51%–34.64%) to IgG and 9.23% (CI 4.30%–18.71%) was positive for both. All patients that were positive to IgM underwent molecular testing through RT-qPCR on oral-rhino pharyngeal swabs and only one specimen was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Instead, the presence of IgG from screened volunteers was confirmed by re-testing serum samples using both an ELISA assay validated for in vitro diagnostic use (IVD) and a recently published synthetic peptide-based ELISA assay. In conclusion, our report suggests that (1) early restrictions were successful in limiting COVID-19 diffusion in the district of Benevento; (2) rapid serological analysis is an ideal testing for both determining real seroprevalence and massive screening, whereas detection of viral RNA remains a gold standard for identification of infected patients; (3) even among people without COVID-19 related symptoms, the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 antigens has individual features.","Polvere, Immacolata; Parrella, Alfredina; Casamassa, Giovanna; D’Andrea, Silvia; Tizzano, Annamaria; Cardinale, Gaetano; Voccola, Serena; Porcaro, Piercarmine; Stilo, Romania; Vito, Pasquale; Zotti, Tiziana",Diagnostics (Basel),97,20

Further, in China, early intervention policy has been enacted since February. Whether early intervention contributes to swift recovery is still unknown. Hence, in this study, we focused on the patients from an isolated area, investigated the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of four serial passages of the virus. METHODS: From January 25 to February 29, 2020, all patient data on the SARS-CoV-2 passages in this isolated area were traced, and the patients were grouped according to the passaging of SARS-CoV-2. Clinical characteristics of patients, including laboratory, radiology, treatment and outcomes, were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients with four passages of virus transmission were included in this study. One patient transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to 8 patients (passage 2, P2), who next infected 23 patients (passage 3, P3), and then 46 patients (passage 4, P4). P2 received antiviral treatment when they had symptom, whereas P4 received antiviral treatment during their asymptomatic period. The incubation periods for P2, P3 and P4 patients were 7 days (IQR:2–12), 8 days (IQR:4–13) and 10 days (IQR:7–15), respectively. P2 patients showed lymphocytopenia (0.79 × 10(9)/L), decreased lymphocyte percentages (12.15%), increased white blood cell count (6.51 × 10(9)/L), increased total bilirubin levels (25% of P2 patients), increased C-reactive protein levels (100% of P2 patients) and abnormal liver function. By chest CT scans, all P2 patients (100%), 15 of P3 patients (65.22%) and 16 of P4 patients (34.78%) showed abnormality with typical feature of ground glass opacity. All of P2 patients (100%) received oxygen therapy, and in contrast, 19 of P4 patients (41.3%) received oxygen therapy. Further, significant decreased nucleic acid positive periods was found in P4 group (16 days, IQR: 10–23), compared with that of P2 group (22 days, IQR: 16–27). Moreover, the severity ratios were sharply decreased from 50% (P2 patients) to 4.35% (P4 patients), and the case fatality rate is zero.

The overall evolutionary rates of hexon gene, fiber gene, and whole genome of HAdV-55 were estimated at 6·2 × 10(−5) s/s/y, 8·0 × 10(−5) s/s/y, and 1·7 × 10(−5) s/s/y, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested HAdV-55 as an emerging infectious disease pathogen has conserved genetic structure and is closely related to each other. Further molecular investigation based on HAdV-55 of wider origin might facilitate understanding its diversity, dissemination, and transmission in China.","Lu, Qing-Bin; Tong, Yi-Gang; Wo, Ying; Wang, Hong-Yu; Liu, En-Mei; Gray, Gregory C; Liu, Wei; Cao, Wu-Chun",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,97,24

While the majority of COVID-19 patients recuperate, a considerable number of patients develop severe complications. Bilateral pneumonia constitutes the hallmark of severe COVID-19 disease but an involvement of other organ systems, namely the cardiovascular system, kidneys, liver, and central nervous system, occurs in at least half of the fatal COVID-19 cases. Besides respiratory failure requiring ventilation, patients with severe COVID-19 often display manifestations of systemic inflammation and thrombosis as well as diffuse microvascular injury observed postmortem. In this review, we survey the mechanisms that may explain how viral entry and activation of endothelial cells by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can give rise to a series of events including systemic inflammation, thrombosis, and microvascular dysfunction. This pathophysiological scenario may be particularly harmful in patients with overt cardiovascular disease and may drive the fatal aspects of COVID-19. We further shed light on the role of the renin–angiotensin aldosterone system and its inhibitors in the context of COVID-19 and discuss the potential impact of antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment options. Acknowledging the comorbidities and potential organ injuries throughout the course of severe COVID-19 is crucial in the clinical management of patients affecting treatment approaches and recovery rate.","Gencer, Selin; Lacy, Michael; Atzler, Dorothee; van der Vorst, Emiel P.

We sought to determine the utility of lung ultrasound for early detection of pneumonia and for assessment of respiratory failure among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Six patients with confirmed COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were enrolled. All had undergone chest X-ray and chest computed tomography (CT) on the day of admission and underwent multiple point-of-care lung ultrasound scans over the course of their hospitalization. RESULTS: Lung ultrasound detected early abnormal findings of representative B-lines in a patient with a normal chest X-ray, corresponding to ground-glass opacities on the chest CT scan. The ultrasound findings improved as her clinical condition improved and her viral load decreased. In another minimally symptomatic patient without significant chest X-ray findings, the ultrasound showed B-lines, an early sign of pneumonia before abnormalities were detected on the chest CT scan. In two critically ill patients, ultrasound was performed to assess for evaluation of disease severity. In both patients, the clinicians conducted emergency rapid sequence intubation based on the ultrasound findings without awaiting the laboratory results and radiological reports. In two children, ultrasound was used to assess the improvement in their pneumonia, thus avoiding further imaging tests such as chest CT. CONCLUSIONS: Lung ultrasound is feasible and useful as a rapid, sensitive, and affordable point-of-care screening tool to detect pneumonia and assess the severity of respiratory failure in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Cho, Young-Jae; Song, Kyoung-Ho; Lee, Yunghee; Yoon, Joo Heung; Park, Ji Young; Jung, Jongtak; Lim, Sung Yoon; Lee, Hyunju; Yoon, Ho Il; Park, Kyoung Un; Kim, Hong Bin; Kim, Eu Suk",Korean J Intern Med,97,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Type Specific Primer based one step RT-PCR (TSP-PCR) test to distinguish the L and S type strains of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for viral genome sequencing, was developed. The study also analyzed 18,221 whole genome sequences (WGS) available up to April 2020 to know the prevalence of L and S type of strains. Phylogenetic and recombination analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome with nearest animal and human coronaviruses were analyzed using MEGA X and SimPlot version 3.5.1 software respectively. RESULTS: The rapid TSP-PCR distinguished the L and S type strains of SARS-CoV-2 by amplifying a specific 326 bp and 256 bp fragment of the L and S type strain respectively. The test was used to analyzed 120 random SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from Assam, India among which 118 were found to be of L-type strains only. On analysis of 18,221 WGS, it was found that L type was the predominant strain with an overall prevalence ∼90%. However, pockets of high prevalence of S-type strains (>35%) were still in circulation in Washington region in April 2020. The study did not detect any significant recombination events between closely related coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: TSP-based PCR for identification of circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2, will add in rapid identification of strains of COVID-19 pandemic to understand the spread of the virus, its transmissibility and adaptation into human population. Though, the S-type strains have decreased drastically across the globe since April 2020, the role of TSP-PCR in geographical niches where such strains are still prevalent may help in rapidly distinguishing the strains and study its evolution.","Borkakoty, Biswajyoti; Bali, Nargis K.",Indian J Med Microbiol,97,1

Complementary work on autophagy in higher eukaryotes has revealed both the deep conservation of this process, as well as novel mechanisms by which autophagy is regulated in the context of development, immunity, and neuronal homeostasis. The recent emergence of new clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9)-based technologies has begun facilitating efforts to define novel autophagy factors and pathways by forward genetic screening in mammalian cells. Here, we set out to develop an expanded toolkit of autophagy reporters amenable to CRISPR/Cas9 screening. Genome-wide screening of our reporters in mammalian cells recovered virtually all known autophagy-related (ATG) factors as well as previously uncharacterized factors, including vacuolar protein sorting 37 homolog A (VPS37A), transmembrane protein 251 (TMEM251), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 (ALS2), and TMEM41B. To validate this data set, we used quantitative microscopy and biochemical analyses to show that 1 novel hit, TMEM41B, is required for phagophore maturation. TMEM41B is an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein distantly related to the established autophagy factor vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1), and our data show that these two factors play related, albeit not fully overlapping, roles in autophagosome biogenesis. In sum, our work uncovers new ATG factors, reveals a malleable network of autophagy receptor genetic interactions, and provides a valuable resource (http://crispr.deniclab.com) for further mining of novel autophagy mechanisms.","Shoemaker, Christopher J.; Huang, Tina Q.; Weir, Nicholas R.; Polyakov, Nicole J.; Schultz, Sebastian W.; Denic, Vladimir",PLoS Biol,97,16

Since the viral entry into host cells depends on specific interactions between the receptor−binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike protein and the membrane−bound monocarboxypeptidase angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the development of high affinity RBD binders to compete with human ACE2 represents a promising strategy for the design of therapeutics to prevent viral entry. Here, we report the discovery of such a binder and its improvement via a combination of computational and experimental approaches. The binder micasin, a known fungal defensin from the dermatophytic fungus Microsporum canis with antibacterial activity, can dock to the crevice formed by the receptor−binding motif (RBM) of RBD via an extensive shape complementarity interface (855.9 Å2 in area) with numerous hydrophobic and hydrogen−bonding interactions. Using microscale thermophoresis (MST) technique, we confirmed that micasin and its C−terminal γ−core derivative with multiple predicted interacting residues exhibited a low micromolar affinity to RBD. Expanding the interface area of micasin through a single point mutation to 970.5 Å2 accompanying an enhanced hydrogen bond network significantly improved its binding affinity by six−fold.

This paper also explores the influence of variables, such as foreign exchange rates, incomes, relative prices, and transportation costs, on the dynamics of the demand for inbound tourism. This paper finds that a long-term equilibrium exists among all variables, indicating that macroeconomic variables may be used to determine the rise or fall of the number of inbound tourism arrivals. Income and foreign exchange rates are both significant explanatory variables. In terms of incurred losses, the number of inbound tourism arrivals suffered the greatest decline during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), followed by the 21st September 1999 earthquake and the 11th September 2001 attacks. The impact of the Asian financial crisis was relatively mild. This paper finds that any impact on safety, whether domestic or international, negatively affects tourism demand. The impact of financial crises on tourism demand is less significant. Ensuring the safety and health of tourists is the key to maintain demand for inbound tourism.","Wang, Yu-Shan",Tour Manag,97,1

Studies show that AMS is associated with death and prolonged hospital stay. In addition to respiratory insufficiency, COVID-19 causes multi-organ failure and multiple metabolic derangements, which can cause AMS, and the multi-system involvement could account for the prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality. In this study, we built on our previous publication (Chachkhiani et al., 2020) using a new, larger cohort to investigate whether we could reproduce our previous findings while addressing some of the prior study’s limitations. Most notably, we sought to determine whether AMS still predicted prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality after controlling for systemic complications such as sepsis, liver failure, kidney failure, and electrolyte abnormalities. OBJECTIVES: The primary purpose was to document the frequency of AMS in patients with COVID-19 at the time of presentation to the emergency room. Secondary aims were to determine: 1) if AMS at presentation was associated with worse outcomes as measured by prolonged hospitalization and death; and 2) if AMS remained a predictor of worse outcome after adjusting for concomitant organ failure and metabolic derangements. RESULTS: Out of 367 patients, 95 (26%) had AMS as a main or one of the presenting symptoms. Our sample has a higher representation of African Americans (53%) than the US average and a high frequency of comorbidities, such as obesity (average BMI 29.1), hypertension (53%), and diabetes (30%). Similar to our previous report, AMS was the most frequent neurological chief complaint. At their admission, out of 95 patients with AMS, 83 (88%) had organ failure or one of the systemic problems that could have caused AMS. However, a similar proportion (86%) of patients without AMS had one or more of these same problems. Age, race, and ethnicity were the main demographic predictors. African Americans had shorter hospital stay [HR1.3(1.0,1.7),p = 0.02] than Caucasians. Hispanics also had shorter hospital stay than non-Hispanics [HR1.6(1.2,2.1), p = 0.001]. Hypoxia, liver failure, hypernatremia, and kidney failure were also predictors of prolonged hospital stay. In the multivariate model, hypoxia, liver failure, and acute kidney injury were the remaining predictors of longer hospital stay, as well as people with AMS at baseline [HR0.7(0.6,0.9), p < 0.02] after adjusting for the demographic characteristics and clinical predictors. AMS at baseline predicted death, but not after adjusting for demographics and clinical variables in the multivariate model. Hypoxia and hyperglycemia at baseline were the strongest predictors of death. CONCLUSION: Altered mental status is an independent predictor of prolonged hospital stay, but not death. Further studies are needed to evaluate the causes of AMS in patients with COVID-19.","Chachkhiani, David; Isakadze, Marine; Villemarette-Pittman, Nicole R.; Devier, Deidre J.; Lovera, Jesus F.",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,97,16

METHOD: The computation molecular docking screening was performed using Molegro Virtual Docker software (MVD) with grid resolution of 30 Å. Protein of COVID 19 virus was taken from protein data bank. RESULT: The standard inhibitor X77 (N-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-N-[(1R)-2-(cyclohexylamino)-2-oxo-1-(pyridin-3-yl)ethyl]-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide) identified from the protein inhibitor complex 6W63 from protein data bank was docked with COVID 19 protein 6W63 which showed MolDock score of −156.913, rerank Sore −121.296 and H Bond −5.7369, while the flavanoid narcissoside had showed MolDock score −180.739, Rerank Sore −137.092 and H Bond −18.6771. The narcissoside showed potent inhibitory effect which is greater than standard X77. The result showed that narcissoside have high affinity towards 6W63 as it showed thirteen hydrogen bonds with nine amino acids (Arg 188, Glu 166, His 164, Cys 145 (2 bonds), Asn 14 (2 bonds), Cys 44 (2 bonds), His 41 (2 bonds), Gln 192, Thr 190) while X777 showed four hydrogen bonds with amino acids (Gly 143, Cys 145, Glu 166, Ser 144). CONCLUSION: From computation approach it was concluded that narcissoside is a potent inhibitor of viral COVID 19 protein 6W63. The narcissoside have high affinity and inhibition potential than standard inhibitor X77 (N-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-N-[(1R)-2-(cyclohexylamino)-2-oxo-1-(pyridin-3-yl)ethyl]-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide). The narcissoside predicted as more potent inhibitor which can be further optimize, pharmacologically and clinically evaluated for the treatment of novel coronavirus COVID-19.","Dubey, Kushagra; Dubey, Raghvendra",Biomed J,97,1

At present, the role of viral and bacterial components as primary or secondary pathogens in CIRD is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine influenza virus (CIV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), canine herpes virus-1 (CHV-1), canine distemper virus (CDV) and Bordetella bronchiseptica in dogs with CIRD and to compare the data with findings in healthy dogs. Sixty-one dogs with CIRD and 90 clinically healthy dogs from Southern Germany were prospectively enrolled in this study. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs were collected from all dogs and were analysed for CPIV, CAV-2, CIV, CRCoV, CHV-1, CDV, and B. bronchiseptica by real-time PCR. In dogs with acute respiratory signs, 37.7% tested positive for CPIV, 9.8% for CRCoV and 78.7% for B. bronchiseptica. Co-infections with more than one agent were detected in 47.9% of B. bronchiseptica-positive, 82.6% of CPIV-positive, and 100% of CRCoV-positive dogs. In clinically healthy dogs, 1.1% tested positive for CAV-2, 7.8% for CPIV and 45.6% for B. bronchiseptica. CPIV and B. bronchiseptica were detected significantly more often in dogs with CIRD than in clinically healthy dogs (P < 0.001 for each pathogen) and were the most common infectious agents in dogs with CIRD in Southern Germany. Mixed infections with several pathogens were common. In conclusion, clinically healthy dogs can carry respiratory pathogens and could act as sources of infection for susceptible dogs.","Schulz, B.S.; Kurz, S.; Weber, K.; Balzer, H.-J.; Hartmann, K.",Vet J,97,16

Our objectives were to describe the viral shedding and the viral load in LRT and to determine their association with mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a binational study merging prospectively collected data from two COVID-19 reference centers in France and Switzerland. First, we described the viral shedding duration (i.e., time to negativity) in LRT samples. Second, we analyzed viral load in LRT samples. Third, we assessed the association between viral presence in LRT and mortality using mixed-effect logistic models for clustered data adjusting for the time between symptoms’ onset and date of sampling. RESULTS: From March to May 2020, 267 LRT samples were performed in 90 patients from both centers. The median time to negativity was 29 (IQR 23; 34) days. Prolonged viral shedding was not associated with age, gender, cardiac comorbidities, diabetes, immunosuppression, corticosteroids use, or antiviral therapy. The LRT viral load tended to be higher in non-survivors. This difference was statistically significant after adjusting for the time interval between onset of symptoms and date of sampling (OR 3.78, 95% CI 1.13–12.64, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The viral shedding in LRT lasted almost 30 days in median in critically ill patients, and the viral load in the LRT was associated with the 6-week mortality.","Buetti, Niccolò; Wicky, Paul-Henri; Le Hingrat, Quentin; Ruckly, Stéphane; Mazzuchelli, Timothy; Loiodice, Ambre; Trimboli, Pierpaolo; Forni Ogna, Valentina; de Montmollin, Etienne; Bernasconi, Enos; Visseaux, Benoit; Timsit, Jean-François",Crit Care,97,1

Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). It is not understood whether HCoV-HKU1 S protein has similar activity. In addition, the UPR-activating domain in SARS-CoV S protein remains to be identified. RESULTS: In this study we compared S proteins of SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 for their ability to activate the UPR. Both S proteins were found in the endoplasmic reticulum. Transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 catalyzed the cleavage of SARS-CoV S protein, but not the counterpart in HCoV-HKU1. Both S proteins showed a similar pattern of UPR-activating activity. Through PERK kinase they activated the transcription of UPR effector genes such as Grp78, Grp94 and CHOP. N-linked glycosylation was not required for the activation of the UPR by S proteins. S1 subunit of SARS-CoV but not its counterpart in HCoV-HKU1 was capable of activating the UPR. A central region (amino acids 201–400) of SARS-CoV S1 was required for this activity. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 S proteins use distinct UPR-activating domains to exert the same modulatory effects on UPR signaling.","Siu, Kam-Leung; Chan, Ching-Ping; Kok, Kin-Hang; Woo, Patrick C-Y; Jin, Dong-Yan",Cell Biosci,97,20

We searched for and analysed the origin of the Decent Work concept and identified the key principles in ILO policy documents, survey reports, and relevant United Nations’ (UN) documents. We also analysed the implementation of the Decent Work Country Programmes (DWCPs) and examined the available external evaluation reports. Finally, we examined the objectives of the ILO Decent Work Agenda and the Decent Work targets in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in view of occupational health. In two thirds of the ILO’s Member States, the Decent Work Agenda has been successfully introduced and so far fully or partly implemented in their DWCPs. The sustainability of the Decent Work approach was ensured through the UN 2030 Agenda, the ILO Global Commission Report on the Future of Work, and the ILO Centenary Declaration. However, objectives in line with the ILO Convention No. 161 on Occupational Health Services were not found in the DWCPs. Although successful in numerous aspects in terms of the achievement of the Decent Work objectives and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Decent Work Agenda and the Decent Work Country Programmes need further development and inclusion of the necessary strategies, objectives, and actions for occupational health services, particularly in view of the high burden of work-related diseases and, for example, the present global pandemic.

Since the initial description of the syndrome in 1968, the pathophysiology with inflammation after potential triggers, the diagnostics of underlying diseases and causes, the importance of differentiated invasive ventilation and intensive medical care procedures and prognosis are far better researched and understood. The 2012 Berlin ARDS definition takes these advances into account with the aim of bedside identification of patients with ARDS. Avoiding invasive mechanical ventilation when possible, lung protective invasive ventilation when it becomes necessary with adequate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and reducing barotrauma and atelectatic trauma, managing patient fluid load and positioning treatment remain the most important mechanistic procedures. Causal treatment, apart from treatment of underlying infections, is still not available.

METHODS: We adapted a previously published model using contact information from Shanghai to model school reopening under various conditions. We investigated different strategies by combining the contact patterns observed between different age groups during both baseline and “lockdown” periods. We also tested the robustness of our strategy to the assumption of lower susceptibility to infection in children under age 15 years. RESULTS: We find that reopening schools for all children would maintain a post-intervention R(0) < 1 up to a baseline R(0) of approximately 3.3 provided that daily contacts among children 10–19 years are reduced to 33% of baseline. This finding was robust to various estimates of susceptibility to infection in children relative to adults (up to 50%) and to estimates of various levels of concomitant reopening in the rest of the community (up to 40%). However, full school reopening without any degree of contact reduction in the school setting returned R(0) virtually back to baseline, highlighting the importance of mitigation measures. CONCLUSIONS: These results, based on contact structure data from Shanghai, suggest that schools can reopen with proper precautions during conditions of extreme contact reduction and during conditions of reasonable levels of reopening in the rest of the community.","Lee, Benjamin; Hanley, John P.; Nowak, Sarah; Bates, Jason H.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel. The government can further strengthen restrictions and reduce spread within the nation more effectively by implementing restrictions on interstate travel.","Shah, Nita H.; Sheoran, Nisha; Jayswal, Ekta; Shukla, Dhairya; Shukla, Nehal; Shukla, Jagdish; Shah, Yash",J Math Anal Appl,97,20

Methods: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April 13 to May 5, 2020. Adult residents of Greece anonymously completed an online survey that was distributed through email and social media. A total of 1396 fully complete questionnaires were collected. Demographic questions, questions regarding the knowledge about the disease etiology, diagnosis and prevention, and questions related to the respondents' attitude and perception toward the restriction measures and the confidence in different kinds of institutions providing information were included in the survey items. The appropriate statistical analyses were conducted according to the type of variable and the research question. Results: The highest knowledge scores were found in females (74.8%, p = 0.015), individuals over 60 years old (77.3%, p<0.001) and individuals having completed post-secondary or tertiary education (76.5%, p<0.001). Five attitude patterns toward the pandemic were identified: 'trust in institutions', 'trust in the restriction measures', 'trust in media and the internet', 'trust in traditional institutions', and 'measures deniers'. Age, education, and knowledge score were the factors defining the attitudinal patterns revealed. Conclusions: Education and public awareness of scientifically accurate information are the means for eliminating individually and socially irresponsible and dangerous behaviors and protecting public health in periods of health crises.","Anestis, A.; Lomvardeas, O.; Papadakis, N.",,97,29

The current study pays attention to local perspectives, which have appeared in the Sindh Province of Pakistan. METHODS: Given the constraints of the pandemic, and using convenience sampling, we conducted 10 online group discussions, 7 one-on-one interviews, and 30 cellphone discussions from a small town of Sindh Province. We made every effort to make our sampling inclusive in terms of decisive sociocultural factors: gender, religion, level of formal education, and occupation/job. We obtained data from women, men, Muslims and non-Muslims, the formally educated and noneducated, government employees, and daily wage laborers. Moreover, to perform content analysis, we used social media such as WhatsApp and Facebook. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS: We have found that some people consider COVID-19 a “political” game, “supernatural test” or “Western plot”. The given perceptions then guide further actions: either ignore or adopt the preventive measures or take supernatural preventive measures. Considering it as a test of God, Muslims perform prayers, while the Bāgrrī community who practice Hinduism are taking cow urine to deal with the virus. This study brings these perspectives to the center stage; yet, the results cannot be generalized across the country, or within the province. Moreover, the study situates these perspectives within the global and socio-cultural, economic, and political contexts and invites more in-depth studies to inquire why such perspectives emerge. CONCLUSIONS: We discuss different narratives concerning COVID-19 in a small town of Sindh Province. We maintain that documenting these various perspectives and analyzing their impacts on the preparedness programs is essential, yet understanding the causes behind the stated standpoints is equally essential, if not more so.","Ali, Inayat; Saddique, Salma; Ali, Shahbaz",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,97,28

The recent global pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) encourages the use of telemedicine for patients with respiratory symptoms. This study therefore purposes automated detection of severe pharyngitis using a deep learning framework with self-taken throat images. METHODS: A dataset composed of two classes of 131 throat images with pharyngitis and 208 normal throat images was collected. Before the training classifier, we constructed a cycle consistency generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to augment the training dataset. The ResNet50, Inception-v3, and MobileNet-v2 architectures were trained with transfer learning and validated using a randomly selected test dataset. The performance of the models was evaluated based on the accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). RESULTS: The CycleGAN-based synthetic images were reflected the pragmatic characteristic features of pharyngitis. Using the synthetic throat images, the deep learning model demonstrated a significant improvement in the accuracy of the pharyngitis diagnosis. ResNet50 with GAN-based augmentation showed the best ROC-AUC of 0.988 for pharyngitis detection in the test dataset. In the 4-fold cross-validation using the ResNet50, the highest detection accuracy and ROC-AUC achieved were 95.3% and 0.992, respectively. CONCLUSION: The deep learning model for smartphone-based pharyngitis screening allows for fast identification of severe pharyngitis with a potential of the timely diagnosis of pharyngitis. In the recent pandemic of COVID-19, this framework will help patients with upper respiratory symptoms to improve convenience in diagnosis and reduce transmission.","Yoo, Tae Keun; Choi, Joon Yul; Jang, Yeon Il; Oh, Ein; Ryu, Ik Hee",Comput Biol Med,97,32

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal, combined nose and throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates and sputum was collected from persons with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 viral cultures and synthetic positive controls (gBlocks, Integrated DNA Technologies) were tested using i) AusDiagnostics assay (AusDiagnostics Pty Ltd); ii) in-house developed assays targeting the E and RdRp genes; iii) multiplex PCR assay targeting endemic respiratory viruses. Discrepant SARS-CoV-2 results were resolved by testing the N, ORF1b, ORF1ab and M genes. RESULTS: Of 52 clinical samples collected from 50 persons tested, respiratory viruses were detected in 22 samples (42 %), including SARS CoV-2 (n = 5), rhinovirus (n = 7), enterovirus (n = 5), influenza B (n = 4), hMPV (n = 5), influenza A (n = 2), PIV-2 (n = 1), RSV (n = 2), CoV-NL63 (n = 1) and CoV-229E (n = 1). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in four additional samples by the AusDiagnostics assay. Using the in-house assays as the ""gold standard"", the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the AusDiagnostics assay was 100 %, 92.16 %, 55.56 % and 100 % respectively. The Ct values of the real-time in-house-developed PCR assay targeting the E gene was significantly lower than the corresponding RdRp gene assay when applied to clinical samples, viral culture and positive controls (mean 21.75 vs 28.1, p = 0.0031). CONCLUSIONS: The AusDiagnostics assay is not specific for the detection SARS-CoV-2. Any positive results should be confirmed using another NAT or sequencing. The case definition used to investigate persons with suspected COVID-19 infection is not specific.","Rahman, H.; Carter, I.; Basile, K.; Donovan, L.; Kumar, S.; Tran, T.; Ko, D.; Alderson, S.; Sivaruban, T.; Eden, J.-S.; Rockett, R.; O’Sullivan, M.V.; Sintchenko, V.; Chen, S.C-A.; Maddocks, S.; Dwyer, D.E.; Kok, J.",J Clin Virol,97,6

These autoantibodies may develop in response to autoimmune conditions, drugs, neoplastic diseases, and pregnancy. Diagnosis involves clinical presentation, mucocutaneous or intramuscular bleeding, and laboratory findings, such as prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, decreased levels of Factor VIII, and the presence of Factor VIII autoantibodies. The etiology is diverse, with a variety of underlying culprits. Malignancy-associated AHA has been associated with approximately 15% of cases. Urothelial malignancy-mediated AHA is exceedingly rare, with only two previously published reports. The management of AHA includes stabilization and control of bleeding via the use of hemostatic agents, and elimination of the inhibitor with immunosuppressive therapy. Here, we report a case of AHA secondary to urothelial malignancy and review the pathobiology and pathogenesis of Hemophilia A and AHA.","Taza, Fadi; Suleman, Nawar; Paz, Robert; Haas, Christopher",Journal of community hospital internal medicine perspectives,97,1

Although they do not always lead to bird death, they can contribute to poor weight gains and hindered development of young pigeons and, potentially, to poor racing results in sports birds. The gastrointestinal tract disorders of pigeons may be of various etiology, but some of the causative agents are viral infections. This review article provides information collected from scientific reports on RNA-viruses belonging to the Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, and Coronaviridae families; the Avulavirinae subfamily; and the Rotavirus genus that might be implicated in such health problems. It presents a brief characterization, and possible interspecies transmission of these viruses.

The severity of this viral infection is associated with an intense inflammatory activity. DM2 is a disease that also determines a greater degree of systemic inflammation. This is due to hyperglycemia, the higher prevalence of sleep disorders and also the low levels of melatonin, a substance with anti-inflammatory actions, in these patients. In this article, we suggest that exogenous melatonin may have an important anti-inflammatory role in preventing severe forms of COVID -19 in patients with DM2.","Martorina, Wagner José; Tavares, Almir",Rev.

Uncertainty remains about the potential mid- and long-term health sequelae. We prospectively studied patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Liège University Hospital, Belgium, to determine the persistent consequences of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We prospectively recruited patients admitted at the University hospital of Liège for moderate to severe confirmed COVID-19, who were discharged between March 2 and October 1, 2020. Follow-up at 3 and 6 months after hospital discharge included demographic and clinical data, biological data, pulmonary function tests (PFT) and chest HRCT scan. RESULTS: 199 individuals were included in the analysis. Most patients received oxygen supplementation (80.4%). Six months after discharge, 47% and 32% of patients still presented exertional dyspnea and fatigue. PFT at three months revealed a reduced DLCO value (71.6 ± 18.6 %) that significantly increased at six months (p<0.0001). Chest CT showed a high prevalence (in 68.9 % of the cohort) of persisting abnormalities, mostly ground glass opacities. The duration of hospitalization, the admission in ICU or mechanical ventilation were not associated with the persistence of symptoms at 3 months after discharge. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of persisting symptoms following hospitalization for COVID-19 is high and stable up to six months after discharge. However, biological, functional and iconographic abnormalities significantly improved overtime.","Darcis, Gilles; Bouquegneau, Antoine; Maes, Nathalie; thys, Marie; Henket, Monique; Labye, Florence; Rousseau, Anne-Françoise; Canivet, Perrine; Desir, Colin; Calmes, Doriane; Schils, Raphael; De Worm, Sophie; Léonard, Philippe; Meunier, Paul; Moutschen, Michel; Louis, Renaud; Guiot, Julien",Int J Infect Dis,97,29

While there is no compelling biological reason to expect that mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (either preconception or during pregnancy) presents a risk to pregnancy, data are limited. It is, however, well documented that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is associated with severe illness and increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Among recognized pregnancies in high-income countries, 11–16% end in spontaneous abortion (SAB). Methods People enrolled in v-safe, a voluntary smartphone-based surveillance system, who received a COVID-19 vaccine preconception or during pregnancy were contacted by telephone to enroll in the v-safe pregnancy registry. V-safe pregnancy registry participants who received at least one dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine preconception or prior to 20 weeks’ gestation and who did not report a pregnancy loss before 6 completed weeks’ gestation were included in this analysis to assess the cumulative risk of SAB using Life Table methods. Results Among 2,456 pregnant persons who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine preconception or prior to 20 weeks’ gestation, the cumulative risk of SAB from 6–19 weeks’ gestation was 14.1% (95% CI: 12.1, 16.1%). Using direct age standardization to the selected reference population, the age-standardized cumulative risk of SAB was 12.8% (95% CI: 10.8–14.8%). Conclusions When compared to the expected range of SABs in recognized pregnancies, these data suggest receipt of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine preconception or during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of SAB. These findings add to accumulating evidence that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy are safe.","Zauche, Lauren Head; Wallace, Bailey; Smoots, Ashley N.; Olson, Christine K.; Oduyebo, Titilope; Kim, Shin Y.; Peterson, Emily E.; Ju, Jun; Beauregard, Jennifer; Wilcox, Allen J.; Rose, Charles E.; Meaney-Delman, Dana; Ellington, Sascha R.",Res Sq,97,21

Computed tomography, early colonoscopy (colonoscopy performed within 24 h), and endoscopic therapies were included as mediators. A total of 2644 matched pairs were yielded. The rebleeding rate within 30 days was not significant between high- and low-volume hospitals (16% vs. 17%, P = 0.44). The mortality rate within 30 days was significantly higher in the high-volume cohort than in the low-volume cohort (1.7% vs. 0.8%, P = 0.003).

With the declaration of COVID-19 a global pandemic, and later the appearance of first confirmed cases in Yemen, there is an urgent need to assess the preparedness of healthcare facilities (HCFs) and their capacities to tackle a looming COVID-19 outbreak. Herein, we present an assessment of the current state of preparedness and capabilities of HCFs in Yemen to prevent and manage the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: An online survey for HCFs was developed, validated, and distributed. The questionnaire is divided into five main sections: (1) Demographic variables for participants. (2) HCFs capabilities for COVID-19 outbreak. (3) Support received to face the emergence and spread of COVID-19. (4). Current practices of infection prevention and control measures in the HCFs. The last section focused on the recommendations to ensure effective and timely response to this outbreak in Yemen. Descriptive analysis was used to analyze data using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS), version 23. Results: Responses were received from healthcare workers (HCWs) from 18 out of 22 governorates in Yemen. Out of the 296 HCWs who participated in the study, the vast majority (93.9%) believed that the healthcare system in Yemen does not have the resources and capabilities to face and manage a COVID-19 outbreak. Approximately 82.4% of participants rated the general preparedness level of their HCFs as very poor or poor. More specifically, the majority of HCWs rated their HCFs as very poor or poor in term of availability of the following: an adequate number of mechanical ventilators (88.8%), diagnostic devices (88.2%), ICU rooms and beds (81.4%), and isolation rooms (79.7%). Conclusions: The healthcare facilities in Yemen are unprepared and lack the most basic resources and capabilities to cope with or tackle a COVID-19 outbreak. With the current state of a fragile healthcare system, a widespread outbreak of COVID-19 in Yemen could result in devastating consequences. There is an urgent need to provide support to the healthcare workers and HCFs that are on the frontline against COVID-19.","Zawiah, Mohammed; Al-Ashwal, Fahmi Y.; Saeed, Ramzi Mukred; Kubas, Mohammed; Saeed, Sara; Khan, Amer Hayat; Sulaiman, Syed Azhar Syed; Abduljabbar, Rami",Front Public Health,97,27

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational, interview-based study was conducted from 4 to 20 April, 2021, to evaluate the adverse reactions associated with the vaccine of COVID-19 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or AstraZeneca) among the staff and lecturers of the Kabul University of Medical Sciences, Kabul, Afghanistan. Participants were interviewed following the administration of the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccines. They were asked to report any adverse reactions that occurred within 8–10 days after vaccination. The frequency, duration, severity, and outcome of the reactions were recorded. Association of the adverse reactions was analysed with the ages of participants and previous infection with SARS CoV-2. RESULTS: The most common adverse reactions reported by the participants were muscle pain (68.3%), local pain (58.8%) at the site of injection (68.3%), fever (66.3%) and fatigue (66.3%). Almost half of the respondents reported chills, joint pain and headache after receiving the first shot of the vaccine. The frequency of adverse reactions was higher in participants aged 40 years or less, and in those previously infected with SARS CoV-2. The severity of most adverse reactions was mild to moderate. No serious case or death was reported. CONCLUSION: The adverse reactions reported by the participants were mild to moderate in severity, and for a short duration. The findings of this study help us to address the vaccine hesitancy caused by worries about severe adverse effects associated with the COVID-19 vaccine.","Azimi, Mahmoodullah; Dehzad, Wazhma Masoom; Atiq, Mohammad Asif; Bahain, Barin; Asady, Abdullah",Infect Drug Resist,97,1

The local anesthetic option has an excellent safety profile, and energy-based modalities such as radiofrequency-assisted liposuction (RFAL) devices were developed to enhance soft-tissue contraction. The purpose of this study was to report a single center’s experience with two surgeons using the second-generation RFAL device compared with the first-generation device in terms of safety and efficacy. METHODS: In total, 300 consecutive operations were performed under local anesthesia. Following tumescent injection, the RFAL device was used to heat the skin and underlying collagen network. Subsequently, areas to be contoured were followed with suction-assisted lipectomy to remove excess fat and fluid. RESULTS: An estimated 300 operations were performed on 240 patients in 421 anatomic areas. Treated areas included the face, trunk, and extremities. The average maximum temperatures were 38.6°C externally and 65.6°C internally. The average total and fat aspirate volumes were 1264 and 648 mL. There were no major complications or mortalities, and 3 minor complications treated locally. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicated statistically significant lower proportions of major, minor, or cumulative complications compared with the patients who received first-generation RFAL treatment. Major complications were exhibited for 6.25% of the first-generation group and 0% for the second-generation group. The first-generation group exhibited 8.3% minor complications, with 0.7% in the second-generation group. In sum, the data from the second-generation series of RFAL device operations indicate a statistically, as well as clinically, significant reduction in the overall complication rates compared with the first-generation device.","Chia, Christopher T.; Marte, Joseph A.; Ulvila, Derek D.; Theodorou, Spero J.",Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,97,26

Therefore, being unprepared for a crisis of this magnitude which never happened in a century, nurses and NIs experience stress, trauma, and mental health issues that affect their quality of life (QoL). OBJECTIVES: This study inquired the demographic of the NIs, the responses of the participants to the domains of Quality of Life Evaluation Scale (QOLES), and the relationship between the participants’ responses to the scale to each of their demographic profiles. METHODS: This study used a quantitative cross-sectional design through an electronic survey form in the collection of data. Utilizing total enumeration as sampling technique, 152 NIs in Saudi Arabia completed the survey. RESULTS: Across the 22-item questionnaire, the NIs still feel safe being in the hospital, clinic, or other healthcare facilities with a mean of 3.32; while item 8, which is having abundant energy, had the lowest mean of 1.91. The overall mean is 2.61, interpreted as ‘important,’ signifying that the participants ‘agree to some extent.’ CONCLUSION: The QoL of the NIs focused more on their psychological wellbeing and social relationships while the environmental and physical domains had lesser emphasis. In terms of enhancing specificity, comprehensiveness, and generalizability of future studies in QoL, a larger sample and more rigorous design is recommended.","Grande, Rizal Angelo N.; Butcon, Vincent Edward R.; Indonto, Maria Charito Laarni; Villacorte, Liza Mendizabal; Berdida, Daniel Joseph E.",Int J Afr Nurs Sci,97,1

For precise investigations of the immunopathogenesis in these host species, appropriate immunohistochemical markers are highly needed in order to phenotype distinct immune cells populations in camelids. So far, specific immunohistochemical markers for camelid immune cells are rarely commercially available, and cross-reactivity studies are restricted to the use of frozen dromedary tissues. To bridge this gap, 14 commercially available primary antibodies were tested for their suitability to demonstrate immune cell populations on formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections of dromedaries, Bactrian camels, llamas, and alpacas in the present study. Out of these, 9 antibodies directed against CD3, CD20, CD79α, HLA-DR, Iba-1, myeloid/histiocyte antigen, CD204, CD208, and CD68 antigen exhibited distinct immunoreaction patterns to certain camelid immune cell subsets.

Cardiac dysfunction is a serious component of multi-organ failure caused by severe sepsis. Telomere shortening is related to several heart diseases. Telomeres are associated with the shelterin protein complex, which contributes to the maintenance of telomere length. Low-power infrared lasers modulate mRNA levels of shelterin complex genes. This study aimed to evaluate effects of a low-power infrared laser on mRNA relative levels of genes involved in telomere stabilization and telomere length in heart tissue of an experimental model of acute lung injury caused by sepsis. Animals were divided into six groups, treated with intraperitoneal saline solution, saline solution and exposed to a low-power infrared laser at 10 J cm(−2) and 20 J cm(−2), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and LPS and, after 4 h, exposed to a low-power infrared laser at 10 J cm(−2) and 20 J cm(−2). The laser exposure was performed only once. Analysis of mRNA relative levels and telomere length by RT-qPCR was performed. Telomere shortening and reduction in mRNA relative levels of TRF1 mRNA in heart tissues of LPS-induced ALI animals were observed. In addition, laser exposure increased the telomere length at 10 J cm(−2) and modulated the TRF1 mRNA relative levels of at 20 J cm(−2) in healthy animals. Although the telomeres were shortened and mRNA levels of TRF1 gene were increased in nontreated controls, the low-power infrared laser irradiation increased the telomere length at 10 J cm(−2) in cardiac tissue of animals affected by LPS-induced acute lung injury, which suggests that telomere maintenance is a part of the photobiomodulation effect induced by infrared radiation.","da Silva Neto Trajano, Larissa Alexsandra; da Silva Sergio, Luiz Philippe; de Oliveira, Diego Sá Leal; Trajano, Eduardo Tavares Lima; dos Santos Silva, Marco Aurélio; de Paoli, Flavia; Mencalha, André Luiz; de Souza da Fonseca, Adenilson",Photochem Photobiol Sci,97,28

The development of effective vaccines has been focusing on the spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates viral invasion to human cells through its interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. In this work, we perform analytical characterization of N- and O-linked glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein. We explore the novel use of dual-functionalized titanium (IV)-immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Ti-IMAC) material for simultaneous enrichment and separation of neutral and sialyl glycopeptides of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein from HEK293 cells. This strategy helps eliminate signal suppression from neutral glycopeptides for the detection of sialyl glycopeptides and improves the glycoform coverage of the S protein. We profiled 19 of its 22 potential N-glycosylated sites with 398 unique glycoforms using the dual-functional Ti-IMAC approach, which exhibited improvement of coverage by 1.6-fold compared to the conventional hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) glycopeptide enrichment method. We also identified O-linked glycosylation site that was not found using the conventional HILIC approach. In addition, we reported on the identification of mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) glycosylation, which substantially expands the current knowledge of the spike protein’s glycosylation landscape and enables future investigation into the influence of M6P glycosylation of the spike protein on its cell entry.

The spectroscopic studies were extended to the association of aluminum phthtalocyanine (AlPCS(4)) detected with a PAMAM G4 dendrimer with fluorescence studies in both steady state and dynamic state, as well as due to the fluorescence quenching associated to electron-transfer with a distribution of lifetimes. The functionalization of TPPS with peripheral substituents enables the assignment of spontaneous pH-induced aggregates with different and well-defined morphologies. Other work reported in the literature, in particular with soft self-assembly materials, fall in the same area with particular interest for the environment.

METHODS: In addition to routine testing within the SIREN study, viral culture, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed. Total antibody testing (Anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike) were complemented by receptor binding domain indirect ELISA and neutralising antibody assays. RESULTS: The first two SARS-CoV-2 confirmed reinfections had mild symptomatic illness episodes from which infectious virus was recovered at the time of reinfection. The recovered viruses and their sequences were closely related to viruses circulating locally during the time of reinfection and serology was consistent with reinfection. Prior to reinfection, both cases had ELISA and immunoblot detectable anti-N antibodies, but lacked live virus neutralising antibody. Within days following reinfection, neutralising antibodies became detectable and anti-N and anti-S binding antibodies were boosted. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesise that titres of neutralising antibody can be used as a correlate of protection against reinfection. Further analysis using a case-control design is essential in order to confirm this hypothesis.","A, Atti; M, Ferrari; J, Castillo-Olivares; EJM, Monk; R, Gopal; M, Patel; K, Hoschler; MJ, Cole; A, Semper; J, Hewson; AD, Otter; S, Foulkes; J, Islam; M, Mirfenderesky; S, Jain; J, Murira; C, Favager; E, Nastouli; MA, Chand; CS, Brown; JL, Heeney; T, Brooks; VJ, Hall; S, Hopkins; M, Zambon",J Infect,97,20

In this study, we developed a novel portable smartphone-based biosensor via green dendrimer-coated matcha extract/silver nanoparticles (ME-Ag NPs) enriched with polyphenol for detecting hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Also, we investigated the biological evaluation of the nanostructure as a safe preservative for use in biomedical applications. Ag NPs were prepared using a green sonochemical method and were characterized to determine surface and chemical properties by different techniques such as scanning electron microscopy—energy-dispersive X-ray, transmission electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller. Furthermore, antimicrobial and antifungal properties of ME-Ag NPs were investigated against pathogenic microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aureginosa, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus brasiliensis. The experimental sensor methodology was based on the detection of H(2)O(2) by analysis of images of novel silver nanostructure-coated papers and processing of color histograms with a RGB (red–green–blue) analyzer software. Consequently, the smartphone-based biosensor exhibited high sensitivity with detection limits of 0.82 μM response time of 5 s.

The binding constants and the thermodynamic parameters, ΔH, ΔS, and ΔG at different temperatures were also determined by using these equations. Data showed that NC may exhibit a static quenching mechanism with all proteins. The thermodynamic parameters were calculated. Data showed that van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds are the main forces for human serum albumin and hemoglobin. Globulin, however, bound to NC via hydrophobic interaction. The spectral changes of synchronous fluorescence suggested that both the microenvironment of NC and the conformation of the proteins changed in relation to their concentrations during NC's binding.","Maltas, Esra",J Food Drug Anal,97,14

Methods: Observational cohort study of adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit with acute respiratory failure. Patients were divided into COVID+ and COVID- based on SARS-CoV-2 PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs and/or endotracheal aspirates. No COVID-19 specific interventions were given. The primary clinical outcome was death in the ICU within 3 months; secondary outcomes included in-hospital death and disease severity measures. Measurements including autoantibodies, were done longitudinally. ANOVA and Fisher's exact test were used with alpha=0.05, with a false discovery rate of q=0.05. Bayesian analysis was performed to provide credible estimates of the possible states of nature compatible with our results. Results: 22 COVID+ and 20 COVID- patients were recruited, 69% males, median age 60.5 years. Overall, 64% had anti-nuclear antibodies, 38% had antigen-specific autoantibodies, 31% had myositis related autoantibodies, and 38% had high levels of anti-cytokine autoantibodies. There were no statistically significant differences between COVID+ and COVID- for any of the clinical or autoantibody parameters. A specific pattern of anti-nuclear antibodies was associated with worse clinical severity for both cohorts. Conclusions: Severe COVID+ patients have similar humoral autoimmune features as comparably ill COVID- patients, suggesting that autoantibodies are a feature of critical illness regardless of COVID-19 status. The clinical significance of autoimmune serology and the correlation with severity in critical illness remains to be elucidated.","Trahtemberg, U.; Rottapel, R.; Dos Santos, C. C.; Di Battista, A.

Using data from a 2018 survey of physicians (MDs) and nurse practitioners (NPs) working in primary and geriatric care, we assessed whether different configurations were associated with better or worse performance on a number of standard process measures indicative of comprehensive, high-quality primary care. Practices with a large concentration of MDs had the highest estimated labor costs. Practices high in NPs and physician assistants (PAs) were most common in states that grant full scope of practice to NPs.

The most common GI symptoms reported are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. Liver chemistry abnormalities are common and include elevation of aspartate transferase, alanine transferase, and total bilirubin. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects the GI tract via its viral receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II, which is expressed on enterocytes of the ileum and colon. Viral RNA has also been isolated from stool specimens of COVID-19 patients, which raised the concern for fecal-oral transmission in addition to droplet transmission. Although indirect evidence has suggested possible fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, more effort is needed to establish the role of the fecal-oral transmission route.

The complete achievement of this requires a two-step assessment where competency in both knowledge and skills are tested. This study aims to assess the impact of a one-day hands-on spirometry training (Phase1), on the knowledge and application of spirometry among health workers. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study, which describes a one-day (seven hours) spirometry training and skills impartation done at two conference city locations in Enugu and Calabar in the southern part of Nigeria. All the verbally consenting attendees who completed the training assessment tests constituted the study population. The assessment of the spirometry knowledge base before and after the theory and practical sessions, on the various aspects of spirometry, according to international best practices, quality assurance and the interpretation of results, was done and the outcome was analyzed. Factors that could affect the outcome were also assessed. RESULTS: There were 64 consenting participants of whom 54.7% (35/64) were females. Theparticipants demonstrated much improved post-intervention knowledge and could satisfactorily perform spirometry, calibration, interpretation of test results and quality control as evidenced by the post test scores after practical sessions were conducted. Pre-test mean scores improved by a mean difference of 12% (p < 001) and were affected by the year of academic graduation and availability of spirometers at the place of work, an effect that was no longer seen at post-test following the hands-on spirometry training. CONCLUSION: The present study has shown that a one-day spirometry workshop significantly improved the knowledge of spirometry practice. There is need to set up more frequent locally-organized spirometry workshops since a one-day seven-hour effective knowledge and practical training would most likely have significant impact on participants’ spirometry practice with its expected positive outcome on respiratory health in Nigeria.","Ayuk, Adaeze; Ndukwu, Chizalu; Uwaezuoke, Samuel; Ekop, Eno",BMC Pulm Med,97,1

The purpose of this study was to analyze the preference and subjective design features of 133 existing icons associated with COVID-19 prevention measures published by the health and medical organizations of different countries. The 133 icons represent nineteen different function names, such as “Wash Hands” and “Wear Face Mask”. A total of 57 participants were recruited to perform two different tests: ranking test and subjective rating test. The ranking test was conducted to elicit the preference ranking of seven icon designs representing each function name. It was followed by a subjective rating test using 13 semantic scales on the two most preferred icons to analyze their perceived quality. Spearmen correlation was applied to derive the possible correlations between users’ rankings and the semantic scales, and Friedman’s test was also performed to determine the true difference between ranking in terms of each semantic scale to provide a fully meaningful interpretation of the data. Generally, findings from the current study showed that the image presented in the icon is the key point that affects the icons’ perceived quality. Interestingly, Spearman’s correlation analysis between preference ranking and semantic scales showed that vague–clear, weak–strong, incompatible–compatible, and ineffective–effective were the four strongest semantic scales that highly correlated with the preference ranking. Considering the significant relationships between the semantic distances and the functions, images depicted in an icon should be realistic and as close as possible to its respected function to cater to users’ preferences. In addition, the results of Spearman’s correlation and Friedman’s test also inferred that compatibility and clarity of icon elements are the main factors determining a particular icon’s preferability. This study is the first comprehensive study to evaluate the icons associated with the COVID-19 prevention measures. The findings of this study can be utilized as the basis for redesigning icons, particularly for icons related to COVID-19 prevention measures. Furthermore, the approach can also be applied and extended for evaluating other medical icons.","Prasetyo, Yogi Tri; Dewi, Ratna Sari; Balatbat, Naiomi M.; Antonio, Michael Lancelot B.; Chuenyindee, Thanatorn; Perwira Redi, Anak Agung Ngurah; Young, Michael Nayat; Diaz, John Francis T.; Kurata, Yoshiki B.",Healthcare (Basel),97,1

In the present study, we have analyzed the magnitude and breadth of Gag-specific T-lymphocyte and antibody responses elicited in Rhesus macaques after immunization with DNA encoding a human LAMP/gag (hLAMP/gag) chimera. ELISPOT analyses indicated that the average Gag-specific IFN-γ response elicited by the hLAMP/gag chimera was detectable after only two or three naked DNA immunizations in all five immunized macaques and reached an average of 1000 spot-forming cells (SFC)/10(6) PBMCs. High IFN-γ ELISPOT responses were detected in CD8(+)-depleted cells, indicating that CD4(+) T-cells play a major role in these responses. The T-cell responses of four of the macaques were also tested by use of ELISPOT to 12 overlapping 15-amino acids (aa) peptide pools containing ten peptides each, encompassing the complete Gag protein sequence. The two Mamu 08 immunized macaques responded to eight and twelve of the pools, the Mamu B01 to six, and the other macaque to five pools indicating that the hLAMP/gag DNA antigen formulation elicits a broad T-cell response against Gag. Additionally, there was a strong HIV-1-specific IgG response. The IgG antibody titers increased after each DNA injection, indicating a strong amnestic B-cell response, and were highly elevated in all the macaques after three immunizations. Moreover, the serum of each macaque recognized 13 of the 49 peptides of a 20-aa peptide library covering the complete Gag amino acid sequence. In addition, HIV-1-specific IgA antibodies were present in the plasma and external secretions, including nasal washes. These data support the findings of increased immunogenicity of genetic vaccines encoded as LAMP chimeras, including the response to DNA vaccines by non-human primates.","Chikhlikar, Priya; de Arruda, Luciana Barros; Maciel, Milton; Silvera, Peter; Lewis, Mark G.; August, J.

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed hypoxic COVID–19 patients who were consecutively admitted between March 13, 2020 and April 19, 2020. Patients with lung infiltrates and elevated inflammatory markers received a single dose of tocilizumab if no contraindication was present. Systemic steroid, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin were concomitantly used for majority of the patients. FINDINGS: Of the 51 patients included for analysis, 28 (55%) received tocilizumab and 23 (45%) did not receive tocilizumab. Tocilizumab cohort required more invasive ventilation (68% vs. 22%) at baseline and during entire hospitalization (75% vs. 48%). The median time to clinical improvement in tocilizumab vs. no tocilizumab cohorts was 8 days (Interquartile range [IQR]: 6·25 – 9·75 days) vs. 13 days (IQR: 9·75 – 15·25 days) among patients who required mechanical ventilation at any time (Hazard ratio for clinical improvement: 1·83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0·57 – 5·84) and 6·5 days vs. 7 days among all patients (Hazard ratio for clinical improvement: 1·14, 95% CI: 0·55 – 2·38), respectively. The median duration of vasopressor support and invasive mechanical ventilation were 2 days (IQR: 1·75 – 4·25 days) vs. 5 days (IQR: 4 – 8 days), p = 0.039, and 7 days (IQR: 4 – 14 days) vs. 10 days (IQR: 5 – 15 days) in tocilizumab vs. no tocilizumab cohorts, p = 0.11, respectively. Similar rates of hospital–acquired infections occurred in both cohorts (18% in tocilizumab and 22% in no tocilizumab cohort). INTERPRETATION: In patients with severe COVID-19, tocilizumab was associated with significantly shorter duration of vasopressor support. Although not statistically significant, tocilizumab also resulted in shorter median time to clinical improvement and shorter duration of invasive ventilation. These findings require validation from ongoing clinical trials of Tocilizumab in COVID–19 patients.","Kewan, Tariq; Covut, Fahrettin; Al–Jaghbeer, Mohammed J.; Rose, Lori; Gopalakrishna, K.V.; Akbik, Bassel",EClinicalMedicine,97,16

Delirium, which is highly prevalent in general intensive care unit (ICU) populations, is expected to be frequent and prominent in COVID-19 patients hospitalized with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in ICU. In this case report with associated review, we present a case of a critically ill patient with COVID-19 managed in ICU for ARDS. Psychiatry was consulted for management of her hyperactive delirium, likely complicated by environmental factors inherent in management of COVID-19 patients as well as the use of multiple sedatives. Patient was successfully managed by psychiatry with a combination of high-dose melatonin, suvorexant, guanfacine, intravenous haloperidol, and intravenous valproic acid. In addition to case presentation, we discuss a proposed delirium pathophysiology in COVID-19 associated delirium and a systematized approach to evaluation and management of such patients.","Sher, Yelizaveta; Rabkin, Beatrice; Maldonado, Jose R.; Mohabir, Paul",Psychosomatics,97,21

PRRs bridge nonspecific immunity and specific immunity. Through the recognition and binding of ligands, PRRs can produce nonspecific anti-infection, antitumor, and other immunoprotective effects. Most PRRs in the innate immune system of vertebrates can be classified into the following five types based on protein domain homology: Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), and absent in melanoma-2 (AIM2)-like receptors (ALRs). PRRs are basically composed of ligand recognition domains, intermediate domains, and effector domains. PRRs recognize and bind their respective ligands and recruit adaptor molecules with the same structure through their effector domains, initiating downstream signaling pathways to exert effects. In recent years, the increased researches on the recognition and binding of PRRs and their ligands have greatly promoted the understanding of different PRRs signaling pathways and provided ideas for the treatment of immune-related diseases and even tumors. This review describes in detail the history, the structural characteristics, ligand recognition mechanism, the signaling pathway, the related disease, new drugs in clinical trials and clinical therapy of different types of PRRs, and discusses the significance of the research on pattern recognition mechanism for the treatment of PRR-related diseases.","Li, Danyang; Wu, Minghua",Signal Transduct Target Ther,97,1

It detected all of 62 strains belonging to subgenus F (AdF) but only 4 40 non-AdF serotypes. This is possibly due to the concentration of AdF strains in faeces being greater than non-AdF strains. No false positive reactions were found with 55 AV-negative faeces, 42 of which contained other viruses frequently found in faeces. Only one of the 157 specimens examined gave a non-specific reaction, i.e. test and control latexes both agglutinated. All of 14 AV isolates but none of the 12 isolates of other viruses were LA positive. It is concluded that LA would be useful for detecting AdF strain in faeces and for confirmation of AV isolates, especially if electron microscopic facilities were not available.","Bryden, AS; Ashley, CR; Cotterill, H; Chesworth, C; Caul, EO",Serodiagnosis and Immunotherapy in Infectious Disease,97,29

Methods A review of the literature pertaining to the use of ECT in COVID-19 patients with NPS was performed through PubMed, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE. Search terms included “Electroconvulsive Therapy” and “ECT,” combined with “COVID-19” and “SARS-COV-2.” Additionally, we present a case in which ECT was used to achieve complete remission in a patient who developed new onset, treatment-resistant depression, psychosis, and catatonia, associated with COVID-19. Results 67 articles were reviewed with 3 selected for inclusion. These articles detailed 3 case reports of patients with new onset NPS (mania, psychosis and suicidality, and catatonia) that developed in the context of active COVID-19 and were treated successfully with ECT. Conclusions There is a significant prevalence of new onset NPS, some severe and persistent, in COVID-19 patients. ECT, a broad-spectrum treatment that has been found to be effective in various NPS (independent of etiology), is shown in our case report and others, to be safe and effective for NPS associated with COVID-19. Though we identified only 3 other cases in the literature, we believe that the probable anti-inflammatory mechanism of ECT, its safety and tolerability, and the faster time to symptom remission support the need for more research and increased clinician awareness about this life-saving procedure.","Austgen, Gabriela; Meyers, Matthew; Gordon, Mollie; Livingston, Robin",J Acad Consult Liaison Psychiatry,97,28

The curtailment of personal travel and economic activity provided a unique opportunity for researchers to assess the interplay between anthropogenic emissions of primary air pollutants, their physical transport, chemical transformation, ultimate fate and potential health impacts. In general, reductions in the atmospheric levels of outdoor air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were observed in many countries during the lockdowns. However, the levels of ozone (O(3)), a secondary air pollutant linked to asthma and respiratory ailments, and secondary PM were frequently reported to remain unchanged or even increase. An increase in O(3) can enhance the formation of secondary PM(2.5), especially secondary organic aerosols, through the atmospheric oxidation of VOCs. Given that the gaseous precursors of O(3) (VOCs and NO(x)) are also involved in the formation of secondary PM(2.5,) an integrated control strategy should focus on reducing the emission of the common precursors for the co-mitigation of PM(2.5) and O(3) with an emphasis on their complex photochemical interactions. Compared to outdoor air quality, comprehensive investigations of indoor air quality (IAQ) are relatively sparse. People spend more than 80% of their time indoors with exposure to air pollutants of both outdoor and indoor origins. Consequently, an integrated assessment of exposure to air pollutants in both outdoor and indoor microenvironments is needed for effective urban air quality management and for mitigation of health risk. To provide further insights into air quality, we do a critical review of scientific articles, published from January 2020 to December 2020 across the globe. Finally, we discuss policy implications of our review in the context of global air quality improvement.","Adam, Max G.; Tran, Phuong T.M.; Balasubramanian, Rajasekhar",Atmos Res,97,33

Clinicians are at the forefront of detecting unusual diseases, but the lack of specificity of zoonotic disease symptoms makes this a challenging task. We evaluated patients with community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP) with known and unknown aetiology in an area with a high livestock density and a potential association with animal farms in the proximity. Between 2008 and 2009, a period coinciding with a large Q fever outbreak in the Netherlands, patients with CAP were tested for the presence of possible respiratory pathogens. The presence and number of farm animals within 1 km of the patients' home address were assessed using geographic information system (GIS) and were compared between cases and age‐matched control subjects. Of 408 patients with CAP, pathogens were detected in 275 (67.4%) patients. The presence of sheep and the number of goats were associated with CAP caused by Coxiella burnetii in a multiple logistic regression model (P < 0.05). CAP with unknown aetiology was not associated with the presence of animal farms (P > 0.10). The use of GIS in combination with aetiology of CAP could be potentially used to target diagnostics and to identify outbreaks of rare zoonotic disease.","Huijskens, E. G. W.; Smit, L. A.

These live vaccine strains have a high safety record and can stimulate both cellular and humoral immune responses. As both of these factors are critical characteristics of a good vaccine, we aimed to modify the oral PV vaccines to create a powerful vaccine vector for extraneous antigen expression. In this study, we amplified three separate fragments from the Sabin 1 virus genome by RT-PCR and cloned them into the pGEM-TEasy vector. A cassette containing engineered protease cleavage sites and a polylinker was introduced into one of these fragments (f1) in front of the translation start site. This construction facilitated the insertion of foreign genes into the vector and the subsequent release of their co-translated antigens after digestion by endogenous protease. We also placed a ribozyme (Rz) sequence between the T7 promoter and viral genomic DNA so that in vitro transcription and Rz cleavage recreated the authentic 5′ end of the PV genome RNA. Poly(A)(40) tails were added to the 3′ end of the genome to stabilize the transcribed RNA. The three PV genome fragments and their derivatives were cloned into various types of vectors that were transfected into Vero cells. Virus rescue experiments demonstrated that both the Rz and poly(A)(40 )elements were required for high transfection efficiency of the vector-derived RNAs.","Li, Changgui; Han, Wei; Zhang, Yingqi; Wang, Junzhi",Cytotechnology,97,1

The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown but there are several evidences that associate the genetic basis of the disease with environmental causes. An important association between viral infection and development of MS is clearly demonstrated. Viruses have a strong impact on innate immune cells. In particular, myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), are able to respond to viruses and to activate the adaptive immune response. Methods: In this study we mimic viral infection using synthetic single-strand RNA, Resiquimod, and we compared the response of both DC subsets derived from healthy donors and MS patients by characterizing the expression of costimulatory molecules on the DC surface. Results: We found that pDCs from MS patients express higher levels of OX40-L, HLA-DR, and CD86 than healthy donors. Moreover, we found that blood cells from MS patients and healthy donors upon Resiquimod-stimulation are enriched in a subpopulation of pDCs, characterized by a high amount of costimulatory molecules. Conclusion: Overall, these results indicate that activation of pDCs is enhanced in MS, likely due to a latent viral infection, and that costimulatory molecules expressed on pDCs could mediate a protective response against the viral trigger of autoimmunity.","Corsetti, Marta; Ruocco, Gabriella; Ruggieri, Serena; Gasperini, Claudio; Battistini, Luca; Volpe, Elisabetta",Int J Mol Sci,97,20

Limited school attendance, such as older students sitting exams or the partial return of younger year groups, does not appear to significantly affect community transmission. A large-scale reopening of schools while controlling or suppressing the epidemic appears feasible in countries such as Denmark or Norway, where community transmission is generally low. However, school reopening can contribute to significant increases in the growth rate in countries like Germany, where community transmission is relatively high. Our findings underscore the need for a cautious evaluation of reopening strategies that ensure low classroom occupancy and a solid infrastructure to quickly identify and isolate new infections.","Stage, H.

Thus, treatments by targeting these inflammatory molecules and pathways with a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 (Tocilizumab), C3 inhibitor AMY-101, anti-C5 antibody, anti-TGF-β OT-101, and the use of CRRT in critically ill patients may represent as novel and specific therapies for AKI in COVID-19 patients.","Chen, Junzhe; Wang, Wenbiao; Tang, Ying; Huang, Xiao-ru; Yu, Xueqing; Lan, Hui-Yao",Int J Biol Sci,97,16

This can lead to unrecognized infections in individuals and to setbacks in malaria control in endemic countries where RDTs are the backbone of malaria diagnostics and control. CASE DESCRIPTION: Here the detection of a pfhrp2/3-negative P. falciparum infection acquired in Ethiopia by a 63-year old female traveller is presented. After onset of symptoms during travel, she was first tested negative for malaria, most probably by RDT, at a local hospital in Harar, Ethiopia. Falciparum malaria was finally diagnosed microscopically upon her return to Germany, over 4 weeks after infection. At a parasite density of approximately 5387 parasites/µl, two different high-quality RDTs: Palutop + 4 OPTIMA, NADAL(R)Malaria PF/pan Ag 4 Species, did not respond at their respective P. falciparum test lines. pfhrp2/3 deletion was confirmed by multiplex-PCR. The patient recovered after a complete course of atovaquone and proguanil. According to the travel route, malaria was acquired most likely in the Awash region, Central Ethiopia. This is the first case of imported P. falciparum with confirmed pfhrp2/3 deletion from Ethiopia. CONCLUSION: HRP2-negative P. falciparum strains may not be recognized by the presently available HRP2-based RDTs. When malaria is suspected, confirmation by microscopy and/or qPCR is necessary in order to detect falciparum malaria, which requires immediate treatment. This case of imported P. falciparum, non-reactive to HRP2-based RDT, possibly underlines the necessity for standardized, nationwide investigations in Ethiopia and should alert clinicians from non-endemic countries to the possibility of false-negative RDT results which may increase in returning travellers with potentially life-threatening infections.

For persons who are exposed, the standard of care is observation and quarantine. Whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent symptomatic infection after SARS-CoV-2 exposure is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial across the United States and parts of Canada testing hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis. We enrolled adults who had household or occupational exposure to someone with confirmed Covid-19 at a distance of less than 6 ft for more than 10 minutes while wearing neither a face mask nor an eye shield (high-risk exposure) or while wearing a face mask but no eye shield (moderate-risk exposure). Within 4 days after exposure, we randomly assigned participants to receive either placebo or hydroxychloroquine (800 mg once, followed by 600 mg in 6 to 8 hours, then 600 mg daily for 4 additional days). The primary outcome was the incidence of either laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 or illness compatible with Covid-19 within 14 days. RESULTS: We enrolled 821 asymptomatic participants. Overall, 87.6% of the participants (719 of 821) reported a high-risk exposure to a confirmed Covid-19 contact. The incidence of new illness compatible with Covid-19 did not differ significantly between participants receiving hydroxychloroquine (49 of 414 [11.8%]) and those receiving placebo (58 of 407 [14.3%]); the absolute difference was −2.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval, −7.0 to 2.2; P=0.35). Side effects were more common with hydroxychloroquine than with placebo (40.1% vs. 16.8%), but no serious adverse reactions were reported. CONCLUSIONS: After high-risk or moderate-risk exposure to Covid-19, hydroxychloroquine did not prevent illness compatible with Covid-19 or confirmed infection when used as postexposure prophylaxis within 4 days after exposure.

Currently, prenylation has been detected in type 1 adenovirus, hepatitis C virus, several herpes viruses, influenza virus, HIV. However, this list is far from complete, given that prenylated proteins play an extremely important role in the activity of the virus. We assume that the interferon produced in response to PPP may suppress expression of the SREBP2 transcription factor. As a result, the mevalonic acid pathway is violated and, as a result, the formation of early polyprenols precursors (geraniol, geranyl geraniol, farnesol), which are necessary for the prenylation of viral proteins, is blocked and the formation of mature, virulent virus particles is broken. As a consequence, the maturation of viral particles is inhibited, and defective particles are formed. Polyprenol was extracted from greenery (pine, fir and spruce needles, mulberry leaves, etc.), purified by chromatography, phosphorylated and identified by HPLC and NMR. Obtained PPP was used as antiviral in some experimental models in vitro and in vivo. During numerous studies, it was found that PPP manifested versatile antiviral effects, both in vitro and in vivo. The maximum effect was observed with viruses in which the presence of prenylated proteins was established, namely influenza A virus, HIV-1, tick-borne encephalitis virus, hepatitis A and C viruses, herpes simplex viruses type 1 and 2, some coronavirus.

We created a COVID-19 vaccine information chatbot in a popular messenger app in Japan to answer commonly asked questions. Methods: LINE is the most popular messenger app in Japan. Corowa-kun, a free chatbot, was created in LINE on February 6, 2021. Corowa-kun provides instant, automated answers to frequently asked COVID-19 vaccine questions. In addition, a cross-sectional survey assessing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was conducted via Corowa-kun during April 5 to 12, 2021. Results: A total of 59,676 persons used Corowa-kun during February to April 2021. Of them, 10,192 users (17%) participated in the survey. Median age was 55 years (range 16 to 97), and most were female (74%). Intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine increased from 59% to 80% after using Corowa-kun (p < 0.01). Overall, 20% remained hesitant: 16% (1,675) were unsure, and 4% (364) did not intend to be vaccinated. Factors associated with vaccine hesitancy were: age 16 to 34 (odds ratio [OR] = 3.7, 95% confidential interval [CI]: 3.0-4.6, compared to age [≥] 65), female sex (OR = 2.4, Cl: 2.1-2.8), and history of another vaccine side-effect (OR = 2.5, Cl: 2.2-2.9). Being a physician (OR = 0.2, Cl: 0.1-0.4) and having received a flu vaccine the prior season (OR = 0.4, Cl: 0.3-0.4) were protective.

Two types of recombinant porcine EV-Gs carrying papain-like cysteine protease (PLCP) gene of porcine torovirus, a virus in Coronaviridae, are reported. Type 1 recombinant EV-Gs are detected in pig feces in Japan, USA, and Belgium and carry the PLPC gene at the junction site of 2C/3A genes, while PLPC gene replaces the viral structural genes in type 2 recombinant EV-G detected in pig feces in a Chinese farm. We identified a novel type 2 recombinant EV-G carrying the PLCP gene with flanking sequences in place of the viral structural genes in pig feces in Japan. The ~0.3 kb-long upstream flanking sequence had no sequence homology with any proteins deposited in GenBank, while the downstream ~0.9 kb-long flanking sequence included a domain having high amino acid sequence homology with a baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat superfamily. The pig feces, where the novel type 2 recombinant EV-G was detected, also carried type 1 recombinant EV-G. The amount of type 1 and type 2 recombinant EV-G genomes was almost same in the pig feces. Although the phylogenetic analysis suggested that these two recombinant EV-Gs have independently evolved, type 1 recombinant EV-G might have served as a helper virus by providing viral structural proteins for dissemination of the type 2 recombinant EV-G.","Imai, Ryo; Nagai, Makoto; Oba, Mami; Sakaguchi, Shoichi; Ujike, Makoto; Kimura, Ruka; Kida, Moeko; Masuda, Tsuneyuki; Kuroda, Moegi; Wen, Rongduo; Li, Kaixin; Katayama, Yukie; Naoi, Yuki; Tsuchiaka, Shinobu; Omatsu, Tsutomu; Yamazato, Hiroshi; Makino, Shinji; Mizutani, Tetsuya",Infect Genet Evol,97,26

The use of phytochemicals as antiviral agents provides hope against the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2. Several natural compounds were analyzed by virtual screening against six SARS CoV-2 protein targets using molecular docking simulations in the present study. More than a hundred plant-derived secondary metabolites have been docked, including alkaloids, flavonoids, coumarins, and steroids. SARS CoV-2 protein targets include Main protease (M(Pro)), Papain-like protease (PL(pro)), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Spike glycoprotein (S), Helicase (Nsp13), and E-Channel protein. Phytochemicals were evaluated by molecular docking, and MD simulations were performed using the YASARA structure using a modified genetic algorithm and AMBER03 force field. Binding energies and dissociation constants allowed the identification of potentially active compounds. Ligand-protein interactions provide an insight into the mechanism and potential of identified compounds. Glycyrrhizin and its metabolite 18-β-glycyrrhetinic acid have shown a strong binding affinity for M(Pro), helicase, RdRp, spike, and E-channel proteins, while a flavonoid Baicalin also strongly binds against PL(pro) and RdRp.

METHODS: We used data on (1) PrEP use, (2) anal sex acts, and (3) condom use, per partner type [steady partners (SPs), known casual partners (KCPs), and unknown casual partners (UCPs)], collected daily through a mobile application used between December 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020. We compared the period before versus after March 15, 2020, regarding average proportion of days per week at which each end point was reported and average proportion of anal sex acts covered by PrEP and/or condoms. RESULTS: We included data from 136 men who have sex with men. After March 15, 2020, the proportion of days with anal sex increased with SPs [odds ratio (OR) = 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10 to 1.44) and decreased with KCPs (OR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.64 to 0.82) and UCPs (OR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.48 to 0.61). Shifts in partner types were most profound immediately after March 15, 2020, whereas returning to prerestriction levels mid-May 2020. The proportion of days with PrEP use decreased from 74% before to 58% after March 15, 2020 (P < 0.001). After March 15, 2020, PrEP use during sex decreased with UCPs (β = −0.36; 95% CI = −0.72 to 0.00) but not with SPs and KCPs.

CONCLUSIONS: MSM decreased sex with casual partners and increased sex with SP, but changes were transient. Decreases in sex acts with casual partners paralleled decreases in PrEP use. However, condom use during sex with casual partners decreased, indicating the importance of continued sexual health services, including sexually transmitted infections screening and PrEP care, during COVID-19 restrictions.","Jongen, Vita W.; Zimmermann, Hanne M.

Given the significance of occupational-exposure-related infections and deaths, this study aims to assess the roles and tasks of occupational physicians (OPs) in countering the spread of the infection. Indeed, despite the OP’s centrality in risk management in the workplace, its activity in the current epidemic context has rarely been mentioned. Materials and Methods: Three different databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase) were questioned using the main keywords “COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2” that were crossed, according to different needs, with the terms “occupational medicine”, “occupational physician”, “workplace”, and “risk assessment” using, when possible, the MeSH database research. Additionally, a systematic research of the regulatory changes of workplaces health surveillance was performed on reference sites of international, European, and Italian authorities. Results: Fundamental tasks and duties of OPs in the current COVID-19 outbreak are highlighted by examining their clinical activity and technical action. A risk assessment and management workflow is proposed, and medico-legal implications in case of infection at work are also discussed in the light of recent regulatory changes that clearly attribute to OPs an important role in safeguarding public health. Conclusion: The proposed approach can provide new instruments to contrast the spread of the infection as part of a comprehensive system response to the current pandemic, for which OPs are called to assume full responsibility.","Spagnolo, Lorenzo; Vimercati, Luigi; Caputi, Antonio; Benevento, Marcello; De Maria, Luigi; Ferorelli, Davide; Solarino, Biagio",Medicina (Kaunas),97,1

METHODS: Specificity was evaluated using serum/plasma samples from blood donors and routine diagnostic specimens collected before September 2019 (i.e., presumed negative for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies); sensitivity was evaluated using samples from patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Method comparison was performed versus commercially available assays. RESULTS: Overall specificity for the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay (n = 9575) was 99.85% (95% CI 99.75–99.92): blood donors (n = 6714; 99.82%), routine diagnostic specimens (n = 2861; 99.93%), pregnant women (n = 2256; 99.91%), paediatric samples (n = 205; 100.00%).

Whether hospitalized SOT recipients with COVID-19 are at higher risk of mortality than SOT recipients hospitalized for other causes, including non-COVID-19 pneumonia, remains unclear. METHODS: We used logistic regression to compare outcomes of SOT recipients hospitalized with COVID-19 to non-COVID-19 related admissions and with non-COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: Of 17,012 hospitalized SOT recipients, 1682 had COVID-19. Those with COVID-19 had higher odds of ICU admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.12 [95%CI: 1.88-2.39]) and mechanical ventilation (aOR 3.75 [95%CI: 3.24-4.33]).

Conventional vaccinology (isolate, inactivate and inject) approaches are time consuming, laborious and expensive; therefore, the use of computational vaccinology tools are imperative, which can facilitate the design of new and promising vaccine candidates. RESULTS: In current investigation, initially 5548 proteins of P. falciparum genome were carefully chosen for the incidence of signal peptide/ anchor using SignalP4.0 tool that resulted into 640 surface linked proteins (SLP). Out of these SLP, only 17 were predicted to contain GPI-anchors using PredGPI tool in which further 5 proteins were considered as malarial antigenic adhesins by MAAP and VaxiJen programs, respectively. In the subsequent step, T cell epitopes of 5 genome derived predicted antigenic adhesins (GDPAA) and 5 randomly selected known malarial adhesins (RSKMA) were analysed employing MHC class I and II tools of IEDB analysis resource. Finally, VaxiJen scored T cell epitopes from each antigen were considered for prediction of population coverage (PPC) analysis in the world-wide population including malaria endemic regions. The validation of the present in silico strategy was carried out by comparing the PPC of combined (MHC class I and II) predicted epitope ensemble among GDPAA (99.97%), RSKMA (99.90%) and experimentally known epitopes (EKE) of P. falciparum (97.72%) pertaining to world-wide human population. CONCLUSIONS: The present study systematically screened 5 potential protective antigens from P. falciparum genome using bioinformatics tools. Interestingly, these GDPAA, RSKMA and EKE of P. falciparum epitope ensembles forecasted to contain highly promiscuous T cell epitopes, which are potentially effective for most of the world-wide human population with malaria endemic regions. Therefore, these epitope ensembles could be considered in near future for novel and significantly effective vaccine candidate against malaria.

Between March–April 2020 and January–February 2021, COVID-19 mortality declined from 19% to 12% (p<0.001). In the adjusted multivariable analysis, mid and high COVID-19 inpatient prevalence were associated with a 25% and 41% increase in the odds (absolute contribution to probability of death of 2%–3%) of COVID-19 mortality compared with patients with COVID-19 in facilities with low prevalence (<10%), respectively (high prevalence >25%: adjusted OR (AOR) 1.41, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.61; mid-prevalence (10%–25%): AOR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.38). Mid and high COVID-19 prevalence accounted for 76% of patient encounters. CONCLUSIONS: Although inpatient mortality for patients with COVID-19 has sharply declined compared with earlier in the pandemic, higher COVID-19 hospital prevalence remained a common risk factor for COVID-19 mortality. Hospital leaders need to reconsider how we provide support to care for patients in times of increased volume and complexity, such as those experienced during COVID-19 surges.","Fakih, Mohamad Ghazi; Ottenbacher, Allison; Yehia, Baligh; Fogel, Richard; Miller, Collin; Winegar, Angela; Jesser, Christine; Cacchione, Joseph",BMJ Qual Saf,97,28

Studies have shown that umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (uMSCs) could alleviate PF; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. METHODS: The therapeutic effects of uMSC-derived extracellular vesicles (uMSC-EVs) on PF were evaluated using bleomycin (BLM)-induced mouse models. Then, the role and mechanism of uMSC-EVs in inhibiting myofibroblast differentiation were investigated in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: Treatment with uMSC-EVs alleviated the PF and enhanced the proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells in BLM-induced mice, thus improved the life quality, including the survival rate, body weight, fibrosis degree, and myofibroblast over differentiation of lung tissue. Moreover, these effects of uMSC-EVs on PF are likely achieved by inhibiting the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway, evidenced by decreased expression levels of TGF-β2 and TGF-βR2. Using mimics of uMSC-EV-specific miRNAs, we found that miR-21 and miR-23, which are highly enriched in uMSC-EVs, played a critical role in inhibiting TGF-β2 and TGF-βR2, respectively. CONCLUSION: The effects of uMSCs on PF alleviation are likely achieved via EVs, which reveals a new role of uMSC-EV-derived miRNAs, opening a novel strategy for PF treatment in the clinical setting.

METHODS: Systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA statement. There was heterogeneity of included studies, so a descriptive analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included for analysis conducted across a variety of healthcare settings. Overall, there was a trend towards acquisition of adequate images for diagnosis by non-otolaryngology-specialist facilitators with reasonable agreement between asynchronous images and controls; however, there was significant variation between the studies. CONCLUSION: Remote otological assessment using video-otoscopy shows potential as a safe and effective method for detecting the presence of ear disease in a wide range of healthcare settings. Barriers to the acquisition of adequate images include the presence of obstructing cerumen, and strategies to deal with this should be considered. Further work is required to evaluate endoscope-based systems to assess whether they will allow the acquisition of higher quality images.","Metcalfe, Christopher; Muzaffar, Jameel; Orr, Linda; Coulson, Christopher",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,97,2

The hospitalization data pertaining to adult CAP patients (age ≥ 18 years) in two tertiary comprehensive hospitals in Baotou, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China from 2014 to 2018 and meteorological data there in the corresponding period were collected. The exposure–response relationship between the daily average temperature and the hospital admission of adult CAP patients was quantified by using a distributed lag non-linear model. A total of 4466 cases of adult patients with CAP were admitted. After eliminating some confounding factors such as relative humidity, wind speed, air pressure, long-term trend, and seasonal trend, a lower temperature was found to be associated with a higher risk of adult CAP. Compared to 21 °C, lower temperature range of 4 to –12 °C was associated with a greater number of CAP hospitalizations among those aged ≥ 65 years, and the highest relative risk (RR) was 2.80 (95% CI 1.15–6.80) at a temperature of − 10 °C. For those < 65 years, lower temperature was not related to CAP hospitalizations. Cumulative lag RRs of low temperature with CAP hospitalizations indicate that the risk associated with colder temperatures appeared at a lag of 0–7 days. For those ≥ 65 years, the cumulative RR of CAP hospitalizations over lagging days 0–5 was 1.89 (95% CI 1.01–3. 56). In brief, the lower temperature had age-specific effects on CAP hospitalizations in Baotou, China, especially among those aged ≥ 65 years.","Guo, Wenfang; Yi, Letai; Wang, Peng; Wang, Baojun; Li, Minhui",Sci Rep,97,24

To what extent the pre-existing clinical condition and genetic background have implications for COVID-19 still need to be explored. METHODS: Our study included 389,620 participants of European descent from the UK Biobank, of whom 3,884 received the COVID-19 test and 1,091 were tested positive for COVID-19. We examined the association of COVID-19 with an extensive list of 974 medical conditions and 30 blood biomarkers. Additionally, we also tested the association of genetic variants in two key genes related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), with COVID-19 or any other phenotypes. RESULTS: The most significant risk factors for COVID-19 include Alzheimer’s disease (OR = 2.29, 95% CI: 1.25-4.16), dementia (OR = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.36-3.42), and the overall category of delirium, dementia, amnestic and other cognitive disorders (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.24-2.90).

CONCLUSIONS: Our unbiased and extensive search identified pre-existing Alzheimer’s disease and dementia as top risk factors for hospital admission due to COVID-19, highlighting the importance of providing special protective care for patients with cognitive disorders during this pandemic. We also obtained evidence suggesting a direct association of genetic variants with COVID-19.","Zhou, Jingqi; Liu, Chang; Sun, Yitang; Huang, Weishan; Ye, Kaixiong",Brain Behav Immun,97,16

However, the therapeutic reagents against SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains a cleavage motif at the S1/S2 boundary, known to be cleaved by furin. As cleavage is essential for S protein activation and viral entry, furin was selected as the target compound. In this study, we examined the inhibitory effects of two lignans (honokiol and magnolol) on furin-like enzymatic activity using a fluorogenic substrate with whole-cell lysates. Of two compounds tested, honokiol partially inhibited furin-like enzymatic activity. We further examined the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of honokiol using VeroE6 cell line, which is stably expressing a transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). It was shown that honokiol exhibited remarkable inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, honokiol and crude drugs which contain honokiol such as Magnolia species have a potential therapeutic reagents for SARS-CoV-2.","Tanikawa, Takashi; Hayashi, Tsuyoshi; Suzuki, Ryuichiro; Kitamura, Masashi; Inoue, Yutaka",J Tradit Complement Med,97,28

Based on the job demand–control model, this study aimed to analyze the relationship between nursing home professionals’ personal and organizational factors and good care provided to institutionalized older people. Data was collected through a self-administered survey completed by 208 nursing home staff members. Three dimensions of personal factors (i.e., personal accomplishment, depersonalization, and negative old age stereotypes) were significant predictors of good care. Depersonalization and negative old age stereotypes were negatively associated with IOA, and both good care and personal accomplishment were positively associated with good care in nursing homes. Only one work-related factor (i.e., management support) was positively associated with good care. Personal factors may play a significant role in good care. Management support offers a promising mechanism to promote good care among nursing home professionals. The findings support the need to change the focus on entirely completing care tasks to providing good care of residents in nursing homes that promotes management support, personal accomplishment, personalization and positive old age consideration, attitudes, and behaviors. Policies and interventions should be developed to address in a more humanized way.","López, Javier; Pérez-Rojo, Gema; Noriega, Cristina; Velasco, Cristina",Int J Environ Res Public Health,97,16

METHODS: We linked COVID-19-related deaths, screening and infection rates to our RD population (1.2.20–1.5.20) and audited active rheumatology follow-up patients through survey data communicated via a linked mobile phone SMS message. We assessed epidemiology, effect of stringent social distancing (shielding) and quality of life (HRQoL) by Short Form 12 (SF12). RESULTS: There were 10,387 active follow-up patients, 7911 had linked mobile numbers. 12/10,387 RD patients died from COVID-19 (0.12%); local population 4131/7,415,149 (0.12%). For patients with mobile phones, 1693/7911 (21%) responded and of these, 1605 completed the SF12. Inflammatory arthritis predominated 1174/1693 (69%); 792/1693 (47%) were shielding. Advice on shielding/distancing was followed by 1372/1693(81%). 61/1693 (4%) reported COVID-19 (24/61 shielding); medication distribution was similar in COVID and non-COVID patients. Mental SF12 (MCS) but not physical (PCS) component scores were lower in COVID (60) vs. non-COVID (1545), mean differences: MCS, − 3.3; 95% CI − 5.2 to − 1.4, P < 0.001; PCS, − 0.4; 95% CI, − 2.1 to 1.3). In 1545 COVID-negative patients, those shielding had lower MCS (− 2.1; 95% CI − 2.8 to − 1.4) and PCS (− 3.1, 95% CI − 3.7 to − 2.5), both P < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Our full RD cohort had no excess of COVID deaths compared to the general local population. Our survey data suggest that shielding adversely affects both mental and physical health in RD. These data broaden our understanding of shielding, indicating need for further study.","Cleaton, N.; Raizada, S.; Barkham, N.; Venkatachalam, S.; Sheeran, T. P.; Adizie, T.; Sapkota, H.; Singh, B.

External off-chip memory demand needs to be minimized by clever architecture/algorithm co-design, thus saving energy and extending battery lifetime during video encoding. To exploit temporal redundancies among neighboring frames, the motion estimation (ME) algorithm searches for good matching between the current block and blocks within reference frames stored in external memory. To save energy during ME, this work performs memory accesses distribution analysis of the test zone search (TZS) ME algorithm and, based on this analysis, proposes both a multi-sector scratchpad memory design and dynamic management for the TZS memory access. Our dynamic memory management, called neighbor management, reduces both static consumption—by employing sector-level power gating—and dynamic consumption—by reducing the number of accesses for ME execution. Additionally, our dynamic management was integrated with two previously proposed solutions: a hardware reference frame compressor and the Level C data reuse scheme (using a scratchpad memory). This system achieves a memory energy consumption savings of [Formula: see text] and, when compared to the baseline solution composed of a reference frame compressor and data reuse scheme, the memory energy consumption was reduced by [Formula: see text] at a cost of just [Formula: see text] loss in coding efficiency, on average. When compared with related works, our system presents better memory bandwidth/energy savings and coding efficiency results.","Silveira, Dieison Soares; Amaral, Lívia; Povala, Guilherme; Zatt, Bruno; Agostini, Luciano Volcan; Porto, Marcelo Schiavon; Bampi, Sergio",J Real Time Image Process,97,32

Furthermore, we study the sensitivity of the parameters and use the data from Tennessee state (as a case study) to discuss identifiability of the parameters of the model. The non-negative parameters in the model are obtained by solving inverse problems with empirical data from California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. The basic reproduction number is seen to be slightly above the critical value of one suggesting that stricter measures such as the use of face-masks, social distancing, contact tracing, and even longer stay-at-home orders need to be enforced in order to mitigate the spread of the virus. As stay-at-home orders are rescinded in some of these states, we see that the number of cases began to increase almost immediately and may continue to rise until the end of the year 2020 unless stricter measures are taken.","Biala, T.A.; Khaliq, A.Q.M.",Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simul,97,32

Its genome has three open reading frames (ORFs)—called as ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3. ORF1 encodes nonstructural polyprotein having multiple domains, namely: Methyltransferase, Y domain, Protease, Macro domain, Helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In the present study, we show that HEV-macro domain specifically interacts with light chain subunit of human ferritin (FTL). In cultured hepatoma cells, HEV-macro domain reduces secretion of ferritin without causing any change in the expression levels of FTL. This inhibitory effect was further enhanced upon Brefeldin-A treatment. The levels of transferrin Receptor 1 or ferroportin, two important proteins in iron metabolism, remained unchanged in HEV-macro domain expressing cells. Similarly, there were no alterations in the levels of cellular labile iron pool and reactive oxygen species, indicating that HEV-macro domain does not influence cellular iron homeostasis/metabolism. As ferritin is an acute-phase protein, secreted in higher level in infected persons and HEV-macro domain has the property of reducing synthesis of inflammatory cytokines, we propose that by directly binding to FTL, macro domain prevents ferritin from entering into circulation and helps in further attenuation of the host immune response.

This study evaluated the impact of the pandemic on colorectal cancer (CRC) patients at our center and aimed to share the lessons we learned with clinics currently experiencing this impact. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on CRC patients admitted between January 1, 2020 and May 3, 2020; the control group comprised patients admitted between January 1, 2019 and May 3, 2019. RESULTS: During the pandemic, outpatient volumes decreased significantly, especially those of nonlocal and elderly patients, whereas the number of patients who received chemotherapy and surgery remained the same. During the pandemic, 710 CRC patients underwent curative resection. The proportion of patients who received laparoscopic surgeries was 49.4%, significantly higher than the 39.5% during the same period in 2019. The proportion of major complication during the pandemic was not significantly different from that of the control group. The mean hospital stay was significantly longer than that of the control group. CONCLUSIONS: CRC patients confirmed to be infection-free can receive routine treatment. Using online medical counseling and appropriate identification, treatment and follow-up can be effectively maintained. Adjuvant and palliative chemotherapy should not be discontinued. Endoscopic polypectomy, elective, palliative, and multidisciplinary surgeries can be postponed, while curative surgery should proceed as usual. For elderly CRC patients, endoscopic surgery and neoadjuvant radiotherapy are recommended.","Xu, Yun; Huang, Zong-Hao; Zheng, Charlie Zhi-Lin; Li, Cong; Zhang, Yu-Qin; Guo, Tian-An; Liu, Fang-Qi; Xu, Ye",BMC Gastroenterology,97,11

We report our challenges caring for CARDS patients on VV-ECMO and alterations to traditional management strategies. (2) Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of our institutional strategies for managing patients with COVID-19 who required VV-ECMO in a dedicated airlock biocontainment unit (BCU), from March to June 2020. The data collected included the time course of admission, VV-ECMO run, ventilator length, hospital length of stay, and major events related to bleeding, such as pneumothorax and tracheostomy. The dispensation of sedation agents and trial therapies were obtained from institutional pharmacy tracking. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed. (3) Results: Forty COVID-19 patients on VV-ECMO were managed in the BCU during this period, from which 21 survived to discharge and 19 died. The criteria for ECMO initiation was altered for age, body mass index, and neurologic status/cardiac arrest. All cannulations were performed with a bedside ultrasound-guided percutaneous technique. Ventilator and ECMO management were routed in an ultra-lung protective approach, though varied based on clinical setting and provider experience. There was a high incidence of pneumothorax (n = 19). Thirty patients had bedside percutaneous tracheostomy, with more procedural-related bleeding complications than expected. A higher use of sedation was noted. The timing of decannulation was also altered, given the system constraints. A variety of trial therapies were utilized, and their effectiveness is yet to be determined. (4) Conclusions: Even in a high-volume ECMO center, there are challenges in caring for an expanded capacity of patients during a viral respiratory pandemic. Though institutional resources and expertise may vary, it is paramount to proceed with insightful planning, the recognition of challenges, and the dynamic application of lessons learned when facing a surge of critically ill patients.","Shah, Aakash; Dave, Sagar; Galvagno, Samuel; George, Kristen; Menne, Ashley R.; Haase, Daniel J.; McCormick, Brian; Rector, Raymond; Dahi, Siamak; Madathil, Ronson J.; Deatrick, Kristopher B.; Ghoreishi, Mehrdad; Gammie, James S.; Kaczorowski, David J.; Scalea, Thomas M.; Menaker, Jay; Herr, Daniel; Tabatabai, Ali; Krause, Eric",Membranes (Basel),97,1

EVs resemble enveloped viruses in both structural and functional aspects. In full analogy with viral biogenesis, some of these vesicles are generated inside cells and, once released into the extracellular milieu, are called “exosomes”. Others bud from the plasma membrane and are generally referred to as “microvesicles”. In this review, we will discuss the state of the art of the current studies on the relationship between EVs and viruses and their involvement in three important viral infections caused by HIV, HCV and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) viruses. HIV and HCV are two well-known pathogens that hijack EVs content and release to create a suitable environment for viral infection. SARS viruses are a new entry in the world of EVs studies, but are equally important in this historical framework. A thorough knowledge of the involvement of the EVs in viral infections could be helpful for the development of new therapeutic strategies to counteract different pathogens.","Giannessi, Flavia; Aiello, Alessandra; Franchi, Francesca; Percario, Zulema Antonia; Affabris, Elisabetta",Viruses,97,16

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross sectional study of COVID-19 patients with mild and moderate lung involvement presenting at 5 healthcare centres in Trichy district of South TamilNadu in India. Patients underwent HRCT to assess patterns and severity of lung involvement, Inflammatory markers (LDH/Ferritin) and D-Dimer assay and clinical correlation with signs and symptoms. Patients were assessed for oxygen, steroid and anticoagulant therapy, clinical recovery or progression on follow up and details on mortality were collected. The RSNA, Fleischer Society guidelines and CORADS score was used for radiological reporting. New potential classification of patterns of percentage of lung parenchyma involvement in Covid patients is being suggested. RESULTS: The study included 7,340 patients with suspected COVID and 3,963 (53.9%) patients had lung involvement based on HRCT. RT PCR was positive in 74.1% of the CT Positive cases. Crazy Pavement pattern was predominant (n = 2022, 51.0%) and Ground Glass Opacity (GGO) was found in 1,941 (49.0%) patients in the study. Severe lung involvement was more common in the Crazy Pavement pattern. Patients with GGO in moderate lung involvement were significantly more likely to recover faster compared to Crazy Pavement pattern (P value <0.001). CONCLUSION: HRCT chest and assessment of lung patterns can help triage patients to home quarantine and hospital admission. Early initiation of steroids and anticoagulants based on lung patterns can prevent progression to more severe stages and aid early recovery. HRCT can play a major role to triage and guide management especially as RT PCR testing and results are delayed for the benefit of patients and in a social cause to decrease the spread of the virus","Rajalingam, Bavaharan; Narayanan, Ethirajan; Nirmalan, Praveen; Muthukrishnan, Kamalanthan; Sundaram, Vivek; Kumaravelu, Saravanan; Gopalan, Mukundhan; Jeyapal, Senthil; Rajalingam, Baskaran; Khanna, Vijay; Dhoss, Praveen; Gopinath,",Indian J Radiol Imaging,97,19

Linking individuals who committed an addiction-related crime to addiction treatment could improve outcomes. METHODS: The aim of this city-wide, pre-arrest diversion program, Madison Addiction Recovery Initiative (MARI) is to reduce crime and improve health (i.e., reduce the overdose deaths) among adults who committed a minor, non-violent, drug use-related offense by offering them a referral to treatment in lieu of arrest and prosecution of criminal charges. This manuscript outlines the protocol and methods for the MARI program development and implementation. MARI requires its participants to engage in the recommended treatment, without reoffending, during the six-month program, after which the initial criminal charges are “voided” by the law enforcement agency. The project, implemented in a mid-size U.S. city, has involved numerous partners, including law enforcement, criminal justice, public health, and academia. It includes training of the police officer workforce and collaboration with clinical partners for treatment need assessment, treatment placement, and peer support. Program evaluation includes formative, process, outcome (participant-level) and exploratory impact (community-level) assessments. For outcome evaluation, we will compare crime (primary outcome), overdose-related offenses, and incarceration-related data 12 months before and 12 months after the index crime between participants who completed (Group 1), started but not completed (Group 2), and were offered but did not start (Group 3) the program, and adults who would have been eligible should MARI existed (Historical Comparison, Group 4). Clinical characteristics will be compared at baseline between Groups 1–2, and pre-post the program within Group 1. Participant baseline data will be assessed as potential covariates. Surveys of police officers and program completers, and community-level indicators of crime and overdose pre- versus post-program will provide additional data on the program impact. DISCUSSION: By offering addiction treatment in lieu of arrest and prosecution of criminal charges, this pre-arrest diversion program has the potential to disrupt the cycle of crime, reduce the likelihood of future offenses, and promote public health and safety.","Zgierska, Aleksandra E.; White, Veronica M.; Balles, Joseph; Nelson, Cory; Freedman, Jason; Nguyen, Thao H.; Johnson, Sarah C.",Health Justice,97,6

Expression of ApDXS gene was carried out in Escherichia coli Rosetta cells. Tissue-specific ApDXS gene expression by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed maximum fold expression in the leaves followed by stem and roots. Further, the differential gene expression profile of Jasmonic acid (JA)-elicited in vitro adventitious root cultures showed enhanced ApDXS expression compared to untreated control cultures. A. paniculata 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (ApHMGR) gene expression was also studied where it was up-regulated by JA elicitation but showed lower expression compared to ApDXS. The highest expression of both genes was found at 25 µm JA elicitation followed by 50 µm. HPLC data indicated that the transcription levels were correlated with increased andrographolide accumulation. The peak level of andrographolide accumulation was recorded at 25 μM JA (9.38-fold) followed by 50 µM JA (7.58-fold) in elicitation treatments. The in silico generated ApDXS 3D model revealed 98% expected amino acid residues in the favored and 2% in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot with 92% structural reliability. Further, prediction of conserved domains and essential amino acids [Arg (249, 252, 255), Asn (307) and Ser (247)] involved in ligand/inhibitor binding was carried out by in silico docking studies.

These variants concern the Spike protein, which is encoded by the S gene, involved in virus entry into host cells and the major target of vaccine development. We report here that genetic variants of the N gene can impair our ability to utilize antigenic tests for both diagnosis and mass testing efforts aimed at controlling virus transmission. While conducting a large validation study on the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 Ag test, we noticed that some swab samples failed to generate a positive result in spite of a high viral load in Rt-PCR assays. Sequencing analysis of viruses showing discordant results in the Rt-PCR and antigen assays revealed the presence of multiple disruptive amino-acid substitutions in the N antigen (the viral protein detected in the antigen test) clustered from position 229 to 374 a region known to contain an immunodominant epitope. A relevant fraction of the variants, undetected by the antigen test, contained the mutations A376T coupled to M241I. Intriguingly we found that virus sequences with this mutation were over-represented in the antigen-test-negative and PCR-positive samples and progressively increased in frequency over time in Veneto, a region of Italy that has aggressively scaled up the utilization of antigen tests, which reached nearly 68% of all the SARS-CoV-2 swab assays performed there. We speculate that mass utilization of antigen assays could create a selection pressure on the target that may favor the spread of undetectable virus variants.","Del Vecchio, C.; Brancaccio, G.; Brazzale, A.

The effect of such measures can be studied with mobility data, such as data which is generated by counting the number of requests made to Apple Maps for directions in select countries/regions, sub-regions, and cities. OBJECTIVE: We investigate the associations of mobility data provided by Apple Inc and an estimate an an effective reproduction number R(t). METHODS: We regressed R(t) on a polynomial function of daily Apple data, estimated using the whole period, and analyzed subperiods delimited by March 10, 2020. RESULTS: In the estimation results, R(t) was 1.72 when voluntary restrictions against going out ceased and mobility reverted to a normal level. However, the critical level of reducing R(t) to <1 was obtained at 89.3% of normal mobility. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that Apple mobility data are useful for short-term prediction of R(t). The results indicate that the number of trips should decrease by 10% until herd immunity is achieved and that higher voluntary restrictions against going out might not be necessary for avoiding a re-emergence of the outbreak.","Kurita, Junko; Sugishita, Yoshiyuki; Sugawara, Tamie; Ohkusa, Yasushi",JMIR Public Health Surveill,97,16

This study examines the public’s perceptions of the pandemic, assesses the extent to which participants have adhered to a range of recommended health-protective behaviours to prevent infection and spread of the disease, and evaluates whether anxiety about COVID-19 or perceptions related to the pandemic are associated with greater adherence to these behaviours. Study Design A cross-sectional, survey-based design was employed. Data were collected using an electronic survey distributed to students, staff, and faculty at universities in the three major cities of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Abu Dhabi, Al Ain, and Dubai, between the 23rd and 31st April 2020 when government-mandated restrictions were at their most stringent. A total of 634 participants were included in the analysis. Methods Participants reported whether they had adhered to health-protective behaviours such as spatial distancing, increased hygiene and disinfection, and diminished time spent outside their homes. They also reported the perceived efficacy of a range of behaviours aimed at reducing risk for contracting COVID-19. Data relating to perception of risk, negative consequences of contracting the disease, perceived longevity of the illness, and perceptions of the accuracy of the information read about COVID-19 were collected. Anxiety related to COVID-19 was also assessed as well as a range of demographic variables. Binary logistic regressions were used to examine whether the demographic variables, perceived efficacy ratings, and the perception variables were associated with overall adherence to the health-protective behaviours. Results 44.8% of the sample reported adherence to all the examined health-protective behaviours. Participants who were employed, those with some or completed post-secondary education, and those with a chronic illness diagnosis were more likely to adhere to the precautionary behaviours. The perception of personal risk of infection (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 - 0.98), perception of substantial life consequences of becoming infected (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 - 0.10), and the perception that the public health information was clear (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 - 0.83) were all positively related with behavioural adherence. The health-protective behaviours were all perceived as being highly efficacious in combating infection and these efficacy ratings were also positively associated with greater behavioural adherence (OR 0.41 to 0.77). Having read the official government public health information was related to greater behavioural adherence (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23 - 0.61). Conclusions Dissemination of reliable public health information during a public health crisis is essential. This study’s results highlight the importance of providing the public with information that is clear and consistent and, moreover, emphasises the efficacy of the recommended behaviours as this is likely to improve adherence. When individuals perceive themselves to be at personal risk and are aware of the severity of the consequences posed by the illness, they are more likely to adopt caution. However, in this sample, the trustworthiness of the information portrayed in the media and the perceived duration of the pandemic – whether this would resolve soon or persist well into the future – did not impact adherence to precautionary behaviour.","Vally, Zahir",Public Health,97,16

Due to the rapid spreading of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact, it is paramount to find effective treatments against it. Human neutralizing antibodies are an effective method to fight viral infection. However, the recent discovery of new strains that substantially change the S-protein sequence has raised concern about vaccines and antibodies’ effectiveness. Here, we investigated the binding mechanisms between the S-protein and several antibodies. Multiple mutations were included to understand the strategies for antibody escape in new variants. We found that the combination of mutations K417N and E484K produced higher binding energy to ACE2 than the wild type, suggesting higher efficiency to enter host cells. The mutations’ effect depends on the antibody class. While Class I enhances the binding avidity in the presence of N501Y mutation, class II antibodies showed a sharp decline in the binding affinity. Our simulations suggest that Class I antibodies will remain effective against the new strains. In contrast, Class II antibodies will have less affinity to the S-protein, potentially affecting these antibodies’ efficiency.","Hendy, Mohamed; Kaufman, Samuel; Ponga, Mauricio",bioRxiv,97,26

In the current scenario, COVID-19 patients experience severe respiratory syndromes, hence it is envisaged from our study that these traditional medicines are very likely to provide a favourable effect on COVID-19 infections. The active ingredients identified from these natural products are previously reported for antiviral activities against large group of viruses. Totally 47 bioactives identified from the medicinal plants were investigated against the structural targets of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro and spike protein) and human ACE2 receptor. The top leads were identified based on interaction energies, number of hydrogen bond and other parameters that explain their potency to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. The bioactive ligands such as Cucurbitacin E, Orientin, Bis-andrographolide, Cucurbitacin B, Isocucurbitacin B, Vitexin, Berberine, Bryonolic acid, Piperine and Magnoflorine targeted the hotspot residues of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. In fact, this protease enzyme has an essential role in mediating the viral replication and therefore compounds targeting this key enzyme are expected to block the viral replication and transcription. The top scoring conformations identified through docking analysis were further demonstrated with molecular dynamics simulation. Besides, the stability of the conformation was studied in detail by investigating the binding free energy using MM-PBSA method. Overall, the study emphasized that the proposed hit Cucurbitacin E and orientin could serve as a promising scaffold for developing anti-COVID-19 drug. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The objective of this study was to compare concerns about COVID-19 among individuals undergoing cancer treatment to those with a history of cancer not currently receiving therapy and to those without a cancer history. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional anonymous online survey study of adults currently residing in the United States. Participants were recruited over a one-week period (April 3–11, 2020) using promoted advertisements on Facebook and Twitter. Groups were compared using chi-squared tests, Fisher’s exact tests, and t-tests. RESULTS: 543 respondents from 47 states provided information on their cancer history and were included in analyses. Participants receiving active treatment reported greater concern about infection from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (p<0.001), higher levels of family distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (p = 0.004), and greater concern that the general public does not adequately understand the seriousness of COVID-19 (p = 0.04). Those with metastatic disease were more likely to indicate that COVID-19 had negatively affected their cancer care compared to patients with non-metastatic cancer (50.8% vs. 31.0%; p = 0.02). The most commonly reported treatment modifications included chemotherapy delays. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing active treatment for cancer were most concerned about the short-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the logistics as well as potential efficacy of ongoing cancer treatment, longer term effects, and overarching societal concerns that the population at large is not as concerned about the public health implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lou, Emil; Teoh, Deanna; Brown, Katherine; Blaes, Anne; Holtan, Shernan G.; Jewett, Patricia; Parsons, Helen; Mburu, E.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A non-validated, structured, self-administered, electronic survey with 35 closed multiple choice questions was conducted in Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and English and Deutsch versions from April 1st to April 30th, 2020. The survey was distributed through social networks and the official American Confederation of Urology (CAU) website. It was anonymous, mainly addressed to Latin American urologists and urology residents. It included 35 questions exploring different aspects: 1) Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and internal management protocols for healthcare providers; 2) Priority surgeries and urological urgencies and 3) Inpatient and outpatient care. RESULTS: Of 864 surveys received, 846 had at least 70% valid responses and were included in the statistical analyses. Surveys corresponded to South America in 62% of the cases, Central America and North America in 29.7%. 12.7% were residents. Regarding to PPE and internal management protocols, 88% confirmed the implementation of specific protocols and 45.4% have not received training to perform a safe clinical practice; only 2.3% reported being infected with COVID-19. 60.9% attended urgent surgeries. The following major uro-oncologic surgeries were reported as high priority: Radical Nephrectomy (RN) 58.4%, and Radical Cystectomy (RC) 57.3%. When we associate the capacity of hospitalization (urologic beds available) and percentage of high-priority surgery performed, we observed that centers with fewer urological beds (10-20) compared to centers with more urological beds (31-40) performed more frequently major urologic cancer surgeries: RN 54.5% vs 60.8% (p=0.0003), RC 53.1% vs 64.9% (p=0.005) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of writing (May 13th 2020) our data represents a snapshot of COVID-19 outbreak in Latin American urological practices. Our findings have practical implications and should be contextualized considering many factors related to patients and urological care: The variability of health care scenarios, institutional capacity, heterogeneity and burden of urologic disease, impact of surgical indications and decision making when prioritizing and scheduling surgeries in times of COVID-19 pandemic.","Autrán-Gómez, Ana María; Tobia, Ignacio; Molina, Ricardo Castillejos; Covarrubias, Francisco Rodríguez; Benzing, Frank; Maruccia, Serena; Reis, Leonardo de O.; Lay, Ramón Rodríguez; la Reza, Marcelo Torrico De; Torres, Felix Santaella; Porras, Andrés Hernández; Rodríguez, Alejandro",Int Braz J Urol,97,7

Spatial studies of infectious disease epidemics typically use symptomatic infections (cases) to estimate incidence rates (cases/total population), often misinterpreting them as infection risks (infections/total population) or disease risks (cases/infected population). We examined these three measures in a pediatric cohort (N≈3,000) over two chikungunya epidemics and one Zika epidemic and in a household cohort (N=1,793) over one COVID-19 epidemic in Nicaragua. Across different analyses and all epidemics, case incidence rates considerably underestimated both risk-based measures. Spatial infection risk differed from spatial disease risk, and typical case-only approaches precluded a full understanding of the spatial seroprevalence patterns. For epidemics of pathogens that cause many subclinical infections, relying on case-only datasets and misinterpreting incidence rates, as is common, results in substantial bias, a general finding applicable to many pathogens of high human concern.","Carrillo, Fausto Andres Bustos; Mercado, Brenda Lopez; Monterrey, Jairo Carey; Collado, Damaris; Saborio, Saira; Miranda, Tatiana; Barilla, Carlos; Ojeda, Sergio; Sanchez, Nery; Plazaola, Miguel; Laguna, Harold Suazo; Elizondo, Douglas; Arguello, Sonia; Gajewski, Anna M.; Maier, Hannah E.; Latta, Krista; Carlson, Bradley; Coloma, Josefina; Katzelnick, Leah; Sturrock, Hugh; Balmaseda, Angel; Kuan, Guillermina; Gordon, Aubree; Harris, Eva",medRxiv,97,29

Previously, the evolution pattern and similarity among the COVID‐19 causative organism severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and causative organisms of other similar infections have been determined using a single type of genetic marker in different studies. Herein, the SARS‐CoV‐2 and related β coronaviruses Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV), SARS‐CoV, bat coronavirus (BAT‐CoV) were comprehensively analyzed using a custom‐built pipeline that employed phylogenetic approaches based on multiple types of genetic markers including the whole genome sequences, mutations in nucleotide sequences, mutations in protein sequences, and microsatellites. The whole‐genome sequence‐based phylogeny revealed that the strains of SARS‐CoV‐2 are more similar to the BAT‐CoV strains. The mutational analysis showed that on average MERS‐CoV and BAT‐CoV genomes differed at 134.21 and 136.72 sites, respectively, whereas the SARS‐CoV genome differed at 26.64 sites from the reference genome of SARS‐CoV‐2. Furthermore, the microsatellite analysis highlighted a relatively higher number of average microsatellites for MERS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV‐2 (106.8 and 107, respectively), and a lower number for SARS‐CoV and BAT‐CoV (95.8 and 98.5, respectively). Collectively, the analysis of multiple genetic markers of selected β viral genomes revealed that the newly born SARS‐COV‐2 is closely related to BAT‐CoV, whereas, MERS‐CoV is more distinct from the SARS‐CoV‐2 than BAT‐CoV and SARS‐CoV.","Rehman, Hafiz Abdul; Ramzan, Farheen; Basharat, Zarrin; Shakeel, Muhammad; Khan, Muhammad Usman Ghani; Khan, Ishtiaq Ahmad",J Med Virol,97,21

The inadequacy of the popular explanations of seasonality is discussed, and a simple hypothesis is proposed, called temperature dependent viral tropism (TDVT), that is compatible with the above features of respiratory illness. TDVT notes that viruses can spread more effectively if they moderate their pathogenicity (thereby maintaining host mobility) and suggests that endemic respiratory viruses accomplish this by developing thermal sensitivity within a range that supports organ‐specific viral tropism within the human body, whereby they replicate most rapidly at temperatures below body temperature. This can confine them to the upper respiratory tract and allow them to avoid infecting the lungs, heart, gut etc. Biochemical and tissue‐culture studies show that ‘wild’ respiratory viruses show such natural thermal sensitivity. The typical early autumn surge of colds and the occurrence of respiratory illness in the Tropics year‐round at intermediate levels are explained by the tendency for strains to adapt their thermal sensitivity to their local climate and season. TDVT has important practical implications for preventing and treating respiratory illness including Covid‐19. It is testable with many options for experiments to increase our understanding of viral seasonality and pathogenicity.","Shaw Stewart, Patrick D.; Bach, Julia L.",Rev Med Virol,97,16

In turn, HCWs were experiencing tremendous psycho-social crisis as they have had to deal with unexpected emotional requirements (ERs) arising from caring for suffering and dying patients on a daily basis. In that context, recent studies have highlighted how HCWs working during the COVID-19 outbreak manifested extreme emotional and behavioral reactions that may have impacted their mental health, increasing the risk for developing post-traumatic stress symptoms. Purpose: The aim of the study was to investigate post-traumatic stress symptoms, such as intrusion symptoms, as a potential mediator of the link between ERs and crying at work, and whether rumination moderates the relationship between ERs and intrusion-based PTS symptoms among HCWs who have had to deal with patients dying from COVID-19. Methods: An online cross-sectional study design was performed. A total of 543 Italian HCWs (physicians and nurses) participated in the study. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. We used the SPSS version of bootstrap-based PROCESS macro for testing the moderated mediation model. Results: ERs had an indirect effect on crying at work through the mediating role of intrusion symptoms. Results from the moderated mediation model showed that rumination moderated the indirect effect of ERs on crying at work via intrusion symptoms, and this effect was significant only for high rumination. Furthermore, when we tested for an alternative model where rumination moderates the direct effect of ERs on crying at work, this moderation was not significant. Conclusions: As the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, there is an urgent need for decision-makers to rapidly implement interventions aimed at offering timely psychological support to HCWs, especially in those contexts where the risk of emotional labor associated to patients dying from COVID-19 is higher.","Portoghese, Igor; Galletta, Maura; Meloni, Federico; Piras, Ilenia; Finco, Gabriele; D'Aloja, Ernesto; Campagna, Marcello",Front Psychol,97,29

However, noise pollution is also a relevant environmental factor that contributes to the worsening of chronic cardiovascular diseases and even diabetes. This study analyzes the role of short-term noise pollution levels on the incidence and severity of cases of COVID-19 in Madrid from February 1 to May 31, 2020. The following variables were used in the study: daily noise levels averaged over 14 days; daily incidence rates, average cumulative incidence over 14 days; hospital admissions, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions and mortality due to COVID-19. We controlled for the effect of the pollutants PM(10) and NO(2) as well as for variables related to seasonality and autoregressive nature. GLM models with Poisson regressions were carried out using significant variable selection (p<0.05) to calculate attributable RR. The results of the modeling using a single variable show that the levels of noise (leq24h) were related to the incidence rate, the rate of hospital admissions, the ICU admissions and the rate of average cumulative incidence over 14 days. These associations presented lags, and the first association was with incidence (lag 7 and lag 10), then with hospital admissions (lag 17) and finally ICU admissions (lag 22). There was no association with deaths due to COVID-19. In the results of the models that included PM1(0), NO(2), Leq24h and the control variables simultaneously, we observed that only Leq24h went on to become a part of the models using COVID-19 variables, including the 14-day average cumulative incidence. These results show that noise pollution is an important environmental variable that is relevant in relation to the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in the Province of Madrid.","Díaz, Julio; Antonio-López-Bueno, José; Culqui, Dante; Asensio, César; Sánchez-Martínez, Gerardo; Linares, Cristina",Environ Res,97,10

However, few studies reported the impacts of COVID‐19 on liver function in patients with chronic liver diseases. We aimed to describe a case series of COVID‐19 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Confirmed hospitalized COVID‐19 patients from hospitals in 10 cities of Jiangsu province, China were retrospectively included between January 18, 2020, and February 26, 2020. Demographic information, epidemiologic data, clinical features and treatment data were extracted from medical records. Seven COVID‐19 patients with chronic HBV infection were included. Six (85.7%) patients were male. The patients aged from 33 years to 49 years. Two patients had HBV‐related cirrhosis. One patients (14.3%) were positive for serum hepatitis B virus e antigen. On admission, 1 (14.3%) patients had mildly elevated ALT level (>40 U/L) and 1 (14.3%) had elevated AST level (>40 U/L). The serum albumin level and platelet counts were decreased in 2 patients with HBV‐related liver cirrhosis. Three (42.9%) patients had elevated ALT level and 2 (28.6%) patients had elevated AST level in hospitalization. However, the peak ALT and AST level during hospitalization was 51 U/L and 44 U/L, respectively. As of February 29, 2020, all patients were discharged. No patient was admitted to the intensive care units or developed liver failure during hospitalization. The abnormalities of liver function are not uncommon on COVID‐19 patients with chronic HBV infection in our case series. However, no patient developed severe liver‐related complications during hospitalization. This article is protected by copyright.

Each viral genome is accompanied by a set of metadata which supplies important information such as the geographic origin of the sample, age of the host, and the lab at which the sample was sequenced, and is integral to epidemiological efforts and public health direction. Here, we interrogate some shortcomings of metadata within the GISAID database to raise awareness of common errors and inconsistencies that may affect data-driven analyses and provide possible avenues for resolutions. RESULTS: Our analysis reveals a startling prevalence of spelling errors and inconsistent naming conventions, which together occur in an estimated ~ 9.8% and ~ 11.6% of “originating lab” and “submitting lab” GISAID metadata entries respectively. We also find numerous ambiguous entries which provide very little information about the actual source of a sample and could easily associate with multiple sources worldwide. Importantly, all of these issues can impair the ability and accuracy of association studies by deceptively causing a group of samples to identify with multiple sources when they truly all identify with one source, or vice versa.","Gozashti, Landen; Corbett-Detig, Russell",BMC Res Notes,97,1

While many clinical trials are underway to test the efficacy of HCQ as a treatment for COVID-19, underlying mechanisms of HCQ in the setting of COVID-19 remain unclear. Hence, we examined differential gene expression signatures of HCQ exposure, in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection, and host signatures of COVID-19 in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage, and postmortem lung to evaluate whether HCQ transcriptome signatures associate with restoration of SARS-CoV-2-related host transcriptional responses. Here, we show that 24 hours of in vitro treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) with HCQ significantly impacted transcription of 16 genes involved in immune regulation and lipid metabolism. Using transcriptome data from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE and A549 cells and PBMC derived from confirmed COVID-19 infected patients, we determined that only 0.24% of the COVID-19 PBMC differentially expressed gene set and 0.39% of the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 cells differentially expressed gene set overlapped with HCQ-related differentially expressed genes. Moreover, we observed that HCQ treatment significantly impacted transcription of 159 genes in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages involved in cholesterol biosynthetic process and chemokine activity. Notably, when we compared the macrophage HCQ-related gene lists with genes transcriptionally altered during SARS-CoV-2 infection and in bronchoalveolar lavage of COVID-19+ patients, the CXCL6 gene was impacted in all three transcriptional signatures revealing evidence in favor of chemokine modulation. HCQ-related transcriptional changes minimally overlapped with host genes altered in postmortem lung biopsies from COVID-19 participants. These results may provide insight into the immunomodulation mechanisms of HCQ treatment in the setting of COVID-19 and suggest HCQ is not a panacea to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Corley, Michael J.; Sugai, Christopher; Schotsaert, Michael; Schwartz, Robert E.; Ndhlovu, Lishomwa C.",bioRxiv,97,21

New understanding has emerged about the innate and adaptive immune responses elicited in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The understanding of innate immune responses generated in hosts early in SARS-CoV-2 infection is vital for treatment efforts. Antiviral cytokines are released by innate immune cells in response to viral infections that play a pivotal role in limiting viral replication, pathology and generating optimal adaptive immune responses alongside the long-term memory responses against reinfections. One aspect of innate immune response generated against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo and which has received much attention has been high proinflammatory cytokine release in COVID-19 patients. Another vital discovery has been that the antiviral cytokine type I Interferon (IFN) family IFN-α mediates upregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) membrane protein in airway epithelial cells. ACE2 is a receptor that SARS-CoV-2 binds to infect host cells. New understanding has emerged about the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 induced exaggerated proinflammatory cytokine release as well as transcriptional regulation of ACE2.

Quantitative lesions may provide the radiological evidence of the severity of pneumonia and further to assess the effect of comorbidity on patients with COVID-19. METHODS: 294 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled from February, 24, 2020 to June, 1, 2020 from six centers. Multi-task Unet network was used to segment the whole lung and lesions from chest CT images. This deep learning method was pre-trained in 650 CT images (550 in primary dataset and 100 in test dataset) with COVID-19 or community-acquired pneumonia and Dice coefficients in test dataset were calculated. 50 CT scans of 50 patients (15 with comorbidity and 35 without comorbidity) were random selected to mark lesions manually. The results will be compared with the automatic segmentation model. Eight quantitative parameters were calculated based on the segmentation results to evaluate the effect of comorbidity on patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Quantitative segmentation model was proved to be effective and accurate with all Dice coefficients more than 0.85 and all accuracies more than 0.95. Of the 294 patients, 52 (17.7%) patients were reported having at least one comorbidity; 14 (4.8%) having more than one comorbidity. Patients with any comorbidity were older (P < 0.001), had longer incubation period (P < 0.001), were more likely to have abnormal laboratory findings (P < 0.05), and be in severity status (P < 0.001). More lesions (including larger volume of lesion, consolidation, and ground-glass opacity) were shown in patients with any comorbidity than patients without comorbidity (all P < 0.001). More lesions were found on CT images in patients with more comorbidities.

We aimed to characterize the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in Qatar. Methods: A series of epidemiologic studies were conducted including analysis of the national SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and hospitalization database, community surveys assessing current infection, ad-hoc PCR testing campaigns in workplaces and residential areas, serological testing for antibody on blood specimens collected for routine clinical screening/management, national Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19) death registry, and a mathematical model. Results: By July 10, 397,577 individuals had been PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 110,986 were positive, a positivity cumulative rate of 27.9% (95% CI: 27.8-28.1%). PCR positivity of nasopharyngeal swabs in a national community survey (May 6-7) including 1,307 participants was 14.9% (95% CI: 11.5-19.0%); 58.5% of those testing positive were asymptomatic. Across 448 ad-hoc PCR testing campaigns in workplaces and residential areas including 26,715 individuals, pooled mean PCR positivity was 15.6% (95% CI: 13.7-17.7%). SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence was 24.0% (95% CI: 23.3-24.6%) in 32,970 residual clinical blood specimens. Antibody prevalence was only 47.3% (95% CI: 46.2-48.5%) in those who had at least one PCR positive result, but it was 91.3% (95% CI: 89.5-92.9%) among those who were PCR positive >3 weeks before serology testing. There were substantial differences in exposure to infection by nationality and sex, reflecting risk differentials between the CMW and urban populations. As of July 5, case severity rate, based on the WHO severity classification, was 3.4% and case fatality rate was 1.4 per 1,000 persons. Model-estimated daily number of infections and active-infection prevalence peaked at 31,040 and 8.0%, respectively, on May 20 and May 21. Attack rate (ever infection) was estimated at 61.3% on July 12. R0 ranged between 1.45-1.68 throughout the epidemic. Rt was estimated at 0.70 on June 15, which was hence set as onset date for easing of restrictions. Age was by far the strongest predictor of severe, critical, or fatal infection. Conclusions: Qatar has experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that is rapidly declining, apparently due to exhaustion of susceptibles.

Embedded into these big data are implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful information and valuable knowledge that can be discovered by data science solutions, which apply techniques like data mining. There has been a trend that more and more collections of these big data have been made openly available in science, government and non-profit organizations so that people could collaboratively study and analysis these open big data. In this article, we focus on open big data for public transit because public transit (e.g., bus) as a means of transportation is a vital part of many people’s lives. As time is a precious resource, bus delays could negatively affect commuters’ plans. Unfortunately, they are inevitable. Hence, many existing works focused on predicting bus delays. However, predicting on-time or early buses is also important. For instance, commuters who come to a bus stop on time may still miss their buses if the buses leave early. So, in this article, we examine open big data about bus performance (e.g., early, on-time, and late stops). We analyze the data with frequent pattern mining and make predictions with decision-tree based classification. For illustration, we perform predictive analytics on real-life open big data available on Winnipeg Open Data Portal, about bus performance from Winnipeg Transit. It shows the benefits of predictive analytics on open big data for supporting smart transportation services.","F.

Apart from stimulating general interest in the subject, our hope was to provide putative explanations for some of the patients' symptoms based on described physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms seen in other diseases. Herein, we have focused on the carotid bodies. In this hypothetical viewpoint, we have discussed the plasticity of the carotid body chemoreflex and made a comparison between acute and chronic exposures to high altitude with COVID-19. From these discussions, we have postulated that the sensitivity of the hypoxic ventilatory response may well determine the outcome of disease severity and those that live at high altitude may be more resistant. We have provided insight into silent hypoxia and attempted to explain an absence of ventilatory drive and anxiety yet maintenance of consciousness. In an attempt to discover more about the mysteries of COVID-19, we conclude with questions and some hypothetical studies that may answer them.","Machado, Benedito H.; Paton, Julian F.R.",Auton Neurosci,97,24

Recent discussion in the medical community has led to new designs and adoption despite limited evidence. A scoping review was conducted to characterize devices being used and their performance. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of formal databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, Scopus), grey literature, and hand-searched relevant journals. Forward and reverse citation searching was completed on included articles. Article/full-text screening and data extraction was performed by two independent reviewers. Studies were categorized by publication type, device category, intended medical use, and outcomes (efficacy – ability to contain particles; efficiency – time to complete AGMP; and usability – user experience). RESULTS: Searches identified 6489 studies and 123 met criteria for inclusion (k = 0.81 title/abstract, k = 0.77 full-text). Most articles were published in 2020 (98%, n = 120) as letters/commentaries (58%, n = 71). Box systems represented 42% (n = 52) of systems described, while plastic sheet systems accounted for 54% (n = 66). The majority were used for airway management (67%, n = 83). Only half of articles described outcome measures (54%, n = 67); 82% (n = 55) reporting efficacy, 39% (n = 26) on usability, and 15% (n = 10) on efficiency. Efficacy of devices in containing aerosols was limited and frequently dependent on use of suction devices. CONCLUSIONS: While use of various barrier enclosure devices has become widespread during this pandemic, objective data of efficacy, efficiency, and usability is limited. Further controlled studies are required before adoption into routine clinical practice.","Price, Courtney; Ben-Yakov, Maxim; Choi, Joseph; Orchanian-Cheff, Ani; Tawadrous, Davy",Am J Emerg Med,97,16

They can home to damaged tissue, where they can exert pro-regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties. These therapeutic effects involve the secretion of growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines. Moreover, the functions of MSCs could be mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) that shuttle various signaling messengers. Although preclinical studies and clinical trials have demonstrated promising therapeutic results, the efficiency and the safety of MSCs need to be improved. After transplantation, MSCs face harsh environmental conditions, which likely dampen their therapeutic efficacy. A possible strategy aiming to improve the survival and therapeutic functions of MSCs needs to be developed. The preconditioning of MSCs ex vivo would strength their capacities by preparing them to survive and to better function in this hostile environment. In this review, we will discuss several preconditioning approaches that may improve the therapeutic capacity of MSCs. As stated above, EVs can recapitulate the beneficial effects of MSCs and may help avoid many risks associated with cell transplantation. As a result, this novel type of cell-free therapy may be safer and more efficient than the whole cell product. We will, therefore, also discuss current knowledge regarding the therapeutic properties of MSC-derived EVs.","Najar, Mehdi; Martel-Pelletier, Johanne; Pelletier, Jean Pierre; Fahmi, Hassan",World J Stem Cells,97,10

The feed industry has taken active steps to reduce the risk of pathogen entry through ingredients. Medium chain fatty acid (MCFA) and heat pulse treatment could be an opportunity to prevent pathogen contamination. The objective of experiment 1 was to determine the impact of 0, 30, 60, or 90 d storage time on fat-soluble vitamin stability when vitamin premix (VP) and vitamin trace mineral premix (VTM) were blended with 1% inclusion of MCFA (1:1:1 blend of C6:C8:C10) or mineral oil (MO) with different environmental conditions. Samples stored at room temperature (RT) (~22 °C) or in an environmentally controlled chamber set at 40 °C and 75% humidity, high-temperature high humidity (HTHH). The sample bags were pulled out at days 0, 30, 60 and 90 for RT condition and HTHH condition. The objective of experiment 2 was to determine the effect of heat pulse treatment and MCFA addition on fat-soluble vitamin stability with two premix types. A sample from each treatment was heated at 60 °C and 20% humidity. For experiment 1, the following effects were significant for vitamin A: premix type × storage condition (P = 0.031) and storage time × storage condition (P = 0.002) interactions; for vitamin D3: main effect of storage condition (P < 0.001) and storage time (P = 0.002); and for vitamin E: storage time × storage condition interaction (P < 0.001). For experiment 2, oil type did not affect the stability of fat-soluble vitamins (P > 0.732) except for vitamin A (P = 0.030). There were no differences for fat-soluble vitamin stability between VP and VTM (P > 0.074) except for vitamin E (P = 0.016). Therefore, the fat-soluble vitamins were stable when mixed with both vitamin and VTM and stored at 22 °C with 28.4% relative humidity (RH). When premixes were stored at 39.5 °C with 78.8%RH, the vitamin A and D(3) were stable up to 30 d while the vitamin E was stable up to 60 d. In addition, MCFA did not influence fat-soluble vitamin degradation during storage up to 90 d and in the heat pulse process. The vitamin stability was decreased by 5% to 10% after the premixes was heated at 60 °C for approximately nine and a half hours. If both chemical treatment (MCFA) and heat pulse treatment have similar efficiency at neutralizing or reducing the target pathogen, the process of chemical treatment could become a more practical practice.","Saensukjaroenphon, Marut; Evans, Caitlin E; Paulk, Chad B; Gebhardt, Jordan T; Woodworth, Jason C; Stark, Charles R; Bergstrom, Jon R; Jones, Cassandra K",Transl Anim Sci,97,20

CKD has been correlated with increased risk of AKI both in the outpatient and inpatient settings. We aimed to define potential risk factors for AKI among patients with non-dialysis CKD admitted due to COVID-19. METHOD: Multicenter, observational cohort study including 136 adult patients with CKDand 136 age- and sex-matched controls who required admission for COVID-19 in three academic hospitals. Viral infection was confirmed by real-time RT-qPCR and/or serologic testing in all cases. Disease severity on admission was classified according to the WHO—China Joint Mission Report on COVID-19; briefly subjects with COVID-19 were divided into mild (laboratory confirmed, without pneumonia), moderate (laboratory confirmed with pneumonia), severe (dyspnea and/or lung infiltrates >50% of the lung field within 24–48 h) and critical (respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, or other organ failure that requires intensive care). AKI was defined using the 2012 KDIGO classification. CKD was defined as sustained eGFR <60 and >15 ml/min/1.73m2 within the 6 months prior to COVID-19 hospitalization. Baseline eGFR was calculated using the CKD-EPI equation. Demographic and clinical data were gathered from medical records. Outcomes were recorded during the following 28 days after admission. We applied logistic regression analysis to describe potential predictors for AKI. RESULTS: Median age was 80 years (IQR: 70-86). 58.8% of patients were males. The most common symptom on admission was fever (68.8%), followed by cough (57.7%). The majority of subjects presented with severe COVID-19 on admission (75.7%). During 28-day follow-up, 87 patients (32%) developed Stage 1 AKI, 17 subjects (6.3%) developed Stage 2 AKI and 12 patients (4.4%) developed Stage 3 AKI. AKI was more frequent (61 vs 24.3%) and more severe (Stage 2 AKI: 10.3 vs 2.2%; Stage 3 AKI: 6.6 vs 2.2%) among CKD patients. In adjusted logistic regression analysis, only disease severity and baseline eGFR were independent predictors for AKI in COVID-19 patients that required hospitalization. CONCLUSION: CKD patients suffer AKI more frequently and of higher severity during COVID-19. Baseline eGFR, along with COVID-19 severity, are strong predictor factors of AKI in this setting.","Coca, Armando; Burballa, Carla; Centellas Pérez, Francisco Javier; Acosta-Ochoa, Isabel; Pérez Martínez, Juan; Rodriguez, Eva; Fidalgo, Veronica; Ortega Cerrato, Agustin; Crespo, Marta",Nephrol Dial Transplant,97,29

Existing barriers may inhibit the adoption of web-based interventions among stroke survivors and necessitate the involvement of informal caregivers. However, limited information is available on internet accessibility and usability among stroke survivors and their caregivers. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate internet access and usage in a cohort of stroke survivors and their caregivers. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 375 participants (248 stroke survivors and 127 caregivers). Descriptive statistics were generated using cross-tabulation. Comparisons with categorical data were conducted using the chi-square test, whereas the Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparisons involving ordinal variables. RESULTS: Overall, 86.1% (323/375) of the participants reported having internet access. Caregivers were more likely than stroke survivors to access the internet (N=375, χ(2)(1)=18.5, P<.001) and used text messaging (n=321, χ(2)(1)=14.7, P<.001). Stroke survivors and caregivers with internet access were younger than stroke survivors and caregivers without internet access. The highest number of participants who reported internet access were non-Hispanic White. Smartphones were the most common devices used to access the internet. Email was the most common type of internet usage reported. Patients who survived for >12 months after a stroke reported higher internet access than those who survived <3 months (P<.001). The number of hours per week spent using the internet was higher for caregivers than for stroke survivors (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Future feasibility and acceptability studies should consider the role of the informal caregiver, participant age, race and ethnicity, the use of smartphone apps, email and text correspondence, and the amount of time elapsed since the stroke event in the design and implementation of web-based interventions for populations with stroke.","Naqvi, Imama Ali; Montiel, Tahani Casameni; Bittar, Yazan; Hunter, Norma; Okpala, Munachi; Johnson, Constance; Weiner, Mark G; Savitz, Sean; Sharrief, Anjail; Beauchamp, Jennifer Elizabeth Sanner",JMIR Form Res,97,5

Structured light plethysmography (SLP) is a non-contact tidal breathing measurement technique. Lack of reference equations for SLP parameters makes clinical decision-making difficult. We have developed a set of growth-adjusted reference equations for seven clinically pertinent parameters of respiratory rate (f(R)), inspiratory time (t(I)), expiratory time (t(E)), duty cycle (t(I)/total breath time), phase (thoraco-abdominal asynchrony (TAA)), relative thoracic contribution (RTC) and tidal inspiratory/expiratory flow at 50% volume (IE50). Reference equations were developed based on a cohort of 198 seated healthy subjects (age 2–75 years, height 82–194 cm, 108 males). We adopted the same methodological approach as the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) report on spirometric reference equations. 5 min of tidal breathing was recorded per subject. Parameters were summarised with their medians. The supplementary material provided is an integral part of this work and a reference range calculator is provided therein. We found predicted f(R) to decrease with age and height rapidly in the first 20 years and slowly thereafter. Expected t(I), t(E) and RTC followed the opposite trend. RTC was 6.7% higher in females. Duty cycle increased with age, peaked at 13 years and decreased thereafter. TAA was high and variable in early life and declined rapidly with age. Predicted IE50 was constant, as it did not correlate with growth. These reference ranges for seven key measures ensure that clinicians and researchers can identify tidal breathing patterns in disease and better understand and interpret SLP and tidal breathing data.","Motamedi-Fakhr, Shayan; Iles, Richard; Barker, Nicki; Alexander, John; Cooper, Brendan G.",ERJ Open Res,97,1

Most of these tests and vaccines are based on the Spike glycoprotein (S) or the Nucleocapsid (N) viral protein. Conservation of these antigens among viral strains is critical to ensure optimum diagnostic test performance and broad protective efficacy, respectively. We assessed N and S antigen diversity from 17,853 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and evaluated selection pressure. Up to 6–7 incipient phylogenetic clades were identified for both antigens, confirming early variants of the S antigen and identifying new ones. Significant diversifying selection was detected at multiple sites for both antigens. Some sequence variants have already spread in multiple regions, in spite of their low frequency. In conclusion, the N and S antigens of SARS-CoV-2 are well-conserved antigens, but new clades are emerging and may need to be included in future diagnostic and vaccine formulations.","Dumonteil, Eric; Herrera, Claudia",Pathogens,97,1

Several professional health organizations have published position papers stating that there is no evidence to change the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in the management of elevated blood pressure in the context of avoiding or treating COVID-19 infection. In this article, we review the evidence on the relationship between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and COVID-19 infection. In agreement with current guidelines, patients with hypertension should continue taking antihypertensive medications as prescribed without interruption. Because ACEIs and ARBs are also used to retard the progression of chronic kidney disease, we suggest that these recommendations also apply to the use of these agents in chronic kidney disease. No differences generally exist between ARBs and ACEIs in terms of efficacy in decreasing blood pressure and improving other outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and end-stage renal disease. The ACEIs are associated with cough secondary to accumulation of bradykinin and angioedema, and withdrawal rates due to adverse events are lower with ARBs. Given their equal efficacy but fewer adverse events, ARBs could potentially be a more favorable treatment option in patients with COVID-19 at higher risk for severe forms of disease.","Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian; Lavie, Carl J.; Perez-Quilis, Carme; Henry, Brandon M.; Lippi, Giuseppe",Mayo Clin Proc,97,16

Secondly, there is great importance in studying trade-offs with respect to enhancing health system capacity and the impact of the mix of private-public financing. Finally, there are key trade-offs that will continue to be made both in terms of access to testing and ventilators which would benefit greatly from economic appraisal.

In particular, optimal nutrition was proposed as a possible mitigating factor in the context of COVID-19. Indeed, the light is shed on balanced diets, such as the Mediterranean diet, which present the finest nutritional quality to support the immune system and other physiologic functions. In contrast, less varied diets that lack the needed nutrients and favor inflammation have been correlated with adverse health effects, including a hindered immune response, such as the western diet.

An online survey collected information about the sociodemographic characteristics, health status, lifestyle, and dietary habits through the Mediterranean diet questionnaire and a semi-quantitative fod frequency questionnaire, and the COVID-19 infection and its burden. The sample consisted of 399 respondents divided into the case and control groups (37.6 and 62.4%, respectively) on the basis of the presence or absence of a COVID-19 infection history. Results: The participants in the case and control groups had average adherence to the Mediterranean diet and their dietary intake was closer to the western diet. However, the cases had a lower mean of the MedDiet score (p = 0.009). Food groups consumption analysis showed that this significant difference within the overall similar dietary patterns was due to a higher consumption of poultry and a trend toward decreased consumption of olive oil and increased read meat and alcohol intake among the cases. Additionally, gender influenced the levels of different foods' consumption. Nonetheless, the dietary intake did not impact the COVID-19 burden. Conclusion: It is recommended to adopt healthy food choices within the different dietary patterns for a better protection against COVID-19. These findings should be validated in larger-scale studies.","El Khoury, Christine N.; Julien, Sofi G.",Front Nutr,97,1

A clinical risk score to predict 14-day occurrence of hypoxia, ICU admission, and death is unavailable. OBJECTIVE: Derive and validate a risk score to predict suitability for discharge from a monitored setting among an early cohort of patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: Model derivation and validation in a retrospective cohort. We built a manual forward stepwise logistic regression model to identify variables associated with suitability for discharge and assigned points to each variable. Event-free patients were included after at least 14 days of follow-up. PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis between March 1, 2020, and April 12, 2020, in 10 hospitals in Massachusetts, USA. MAIN MEASURES: Fourteen-day composite predicting hypoxia, ICU admission, and death. We calculated a risk score for each patient as a predictor of suitability for discharge evaluated by area under the curve. KEY RESULTS: Of 2059 patients with COVID-19, 1326 met inclusion. The 1014-patient training cohort had a mean age of 58 years, was 56% female, and 65% had at least one comorbidity. A total of 255 (25%) patients were suitable for discharge. Variables associated with suitability for discharge were age, oxygen saturation, and albumin level, yielding a risk score between 0 and 55. At a cut point of 30, the score had a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 82%. The respective c-statistic for the derivation and validation cohorts were 0.8939 (95% CI, 0.8687 to 0.9192) and 0.8685 (95% CI, 0.8095 to 0.9275). The score performed similarly for inpatients and emergency department patients. CONCLUSIONS: A 3-item risk score for patients with COVID-19 consisting of age, oxygen saturation, and an acute phase reactant (albumin) using point of care data predicts suitability for discharge and may optimize scarce resources.

On 2 December 2020, the infection had been confirmed in 1,665,775 patients and caused 45,784 deaths. This unprecedented health crisis challenged the ingenuity of all professionals involved. Decision support systems in clinical care and health services management were identified as crucial in the fight against the pandemic. Methods: This study applies Deep Learning techniques for mortality prediction in COVID-19 patients. Two datasets with clinical information (medication, laboratory tests, vital signs etc.) of 2,307 and 3,870 COVID-19 infected patients admitted to two Spanish hospital chains were used. Firstly, we built a sequence of temporal events gathering all the clinical information for each patient. Next, we used the temporal sequences to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model with an attention mechanism exploring interpretability. We conducted extensive experiments and trained the RNNs in different settings, performing hyperparameter search and cross-validation. We ensembled resulting RNNs to reduce variability and enhance sensitivity. Results: We assessed the performance of our models using both global metrics, by averaging the performance across all the days in the sequences. We also measured day-by-day metrics starting from the day of hospital admission and the outcome day and evaluated the daily predictions. Regarding sensitivity, when compared to more traditional models, our best two RNN ensemble models outperform a Support Vector Classifier in 6 and 16 percentage points, and Random Forest in 23 and 18 points. For the day-by-day predictions from the outcome date, the models also achieved better results than baselines showing system's ability towards early predictions. Conclusions: We have shown the feasibility of our approach to predict the clinical outcome (i.e. discharged alive or death) of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The result is a time series model that can support decision-making in healthcare systems and aims at interpretability. Despite the low-resource scenario, the results achieved are promising and suggests that more data will further increase the performance of the model.","Villegas, M.; Gonzalez-Agirre, A.; Gutierrez-Fandino, A.; Armengol-Estape, J.; Carrino, C.

Since performance data has been previously published on this platform, the manufacturer has modified the workflow design in order to improve assay performance. Evaluation of the new workflow, which eliminated the sample delivery device (SDD), led to a dramatic improvement of assay performance while saving time and making cartridge loading more convenient. METHODS: 145 confirmed positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens were used to evaluate the assay analytical sensitivity, accuracy, and overall time-saving for the 2 workflows that is with and without the use of SDD on the ePlex SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: Elimination of the SDD step led to a dramatic increase in accuracy and the overall limit of detection when using 145 previously defined and valid SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens with relatively low, medium, and high cycle thresholds (C(T)). This simple workflow change led to an overall detection from 94/145 (64.8%) to 131/145 (90.3%), with an additional 37 specimens being detected. C(T) value ranges revealed that 90% of the specimens in the 33 ≤ C(T) < 35.3 C(T) range were detected, whereas with the SDD workflow, only 30% of positive specimens were detected in this same range. Hands-on time for each specimen also improved and showed overall time savings. CONCLUSION: The simple workflow modification eliminating the SDD led to an overall improvement in the detection of positive specimens and also simplified workflow and reduced hands-on time.","Zhen, Wei; Whitfield, Natalie N; Smith, Elizabeth; Shaw, Christine; Ivy, Cristina; Douglas, Caylee; Bickford, Stephanie; Berry, Gregory J",J Appl Lab Med,97,28

People with HIV (PWH) with Medicaid historically have low viral suppression (VS) rates. In a state with previously high Qualified Health Plan coverage of PWH, we examined HIV outcomes by insurance status during the first year of Medicaid expansion (ME). METHODS: Participants were PWH ages 18–63 who attended ≥1 HIV medical visit/year in 2018 and 2019. We estimated associations of sociodemographic characteristics with ME enrollment prevalence and associations between insurance status and engagement in care and VS. RESULTS: Among 577 patients, 151 (33%) were newly eligible for Medicaid, and 77 (51%) enrolled. Medicaid enrollment was higher for those with incomes <100% federal poverty level (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00–1.86) compared with others. Controlling for age, income, and 2018 engagement, those with employment-based private insurance (adjusted risk difference [aRD], −8.5%; 95% CI, −16.9 to 0.1) and Medicare (aRD, −12.5%; 95% CI, −21.2 to −3.0) had lower 2019 engagement than others. For those with VS data (n = 548), after controlling for age and baseline VS, those with Medicaid (aRD, −4.0%; 95% CI, −10.3 to 0.3) and with Medicaid due to ME (aRD, −6.2%; 95% CI, −14.1 to −0.8) were less likely to achieve VS compared with others. CONCLUSIONS: Given that PWH who newly enrolled in Medicaid had high engagement in care, the finding of lower VS is notable. The discordance may be due to medication access gaps associated with changes in medication procurement logistics.","McManus, Kathleen A; Srikanth, Karishma; Powers, Samuel D; Dillingham, Rebecca; Rogawski McQuade, Elizabeth T",Open Forum Infect Dis,97,8

Infections caused by NTM show an increased incidence in immunocompromised patients and patients with underlying structural lung disease. The true global prevalence of NTM infections remains unknown because many countries do not require mandatory reporting of the infection. This is coupled with a challenging diagnosis and identification of the species. Current therapies for treatment of NTM infections require multidrug regimens for a minimum of 18 months and are associated with serious adverse reactions, infection relapse, and high reinfection rates, necessitating discovery of novel antimycobacterial agents. Robust drug discovery processes have discovered inhibitors targeting mycobacterial membrane protein large 3 (MmpL3), a protein responsible for translocating mycolic acids from the inner membrane to periplasm in the biosynthesis of the mycobacterial cell membrane. This review focuses on promising new chemical scaffolds that inhibit MmpL3 function and represent interesting and promising putative drug candidates for the treatment of NTM infections. Additionally, agents (FS-1, SMARt-420, C10) that promote reversion of drug resistance are also reviewed.","Sethiya, Jigar P.; Sowards, Melanie A.; Jackson, Mary; North, Elton Jeffrey",Int J Mol Sci,97,5

The aim of this study is to determine if the prophylactic treatment with a mixture of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. Lactis BB12 and Enterococcus faecium L3 would reduce symptoms and need for drug use in children with allergic rhinitis (AR). Methods: The study included 250 children aged from 6 to 17 years, affected by AR. Patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group (150) or to the placebo group (100). Patients in the intervention group, in addition to conventional therapy (local corticosteroids and/or oral antihistamines), were treated in the 3 months preceding the onset of symptoms related to the presence of the allergen to which the children were most sensitized, with a daily oral administration of a probiotic mixture containing the Bifidobacterium animalis subsp.

Herein we provide pragmatic advice on the management of commonly encountered calcium metabolic problems and osteoporosis. Non-urgent elective appointments should be postponed, and remote consultations and digital health solutions promoted. Patients should be empowered to self-manage their conditions safely. Patients, their caregivers and healthcare providers should be directed to assured national or international online resources and specific patient groups. For patients in acute hospital settings, existing emergency guidance on the management of hyper- and hypo-calcaemia should be followed. An approach to osteoporosis management is outlined. IV zoledronic acid infusions can be delayed for 6–9 months during the pandemic. Patients established on denosumab, teriparatide and abaloparatide should continue planned therapy. In the event of supply issues with teriparatide or abaloparatide, pausing this treatment in the short term is likely to be relatively harmless, whereas delaying denosumab may cause an immediate increased risk of fracture.

APN is abundant in the kidneys and central nervous system. Identified substrates include Angiotensin III (Ang III); neuropeptides, including enkephalins and endorphins; and homones, including kallidan and somatostatin. It is developmentally expressed, a myelomonocytic marker for leukemias, and a receptor for coronovirus. There is evolving support for APN in the regulation of arterial blood pressure and the pathogenesis of hypertension. In rodent strains, intracerebraventricular (i.c.v.) infusions of APN reduces, while inhibitors of APN activity have a pressor effect on blood pressure. Dysregulation of central APN has been linked to the pathogenesis of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. There is evidence that renal tubule APN inhibits Na flux and plays a mechanistic role in salt-adaptation. A functional polymorphism of the ANP gene has been identified in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat. Signaling by APN impacting on blood pressure is likely mediated by regulation of the metabolism of Ang III to Ang IV. Whether APN regulates arterial blood pressure in humans or is a therapeutic target for hypertension are subjects for future exploration.","Danziger, Robert S.",Heart Fail Rev,97,17
