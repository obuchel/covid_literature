3548,3548,3548,Effect of cytomegalovirus reactivation on the time course of systemic host response biomarkers in previously immunocompetent critically ill patients with sepsis: a matched cohort study,18.857744,11.236018,2018-12-18,"BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in previously immunocompetent critically ill patients is associated with increased mortality, which has been hypothesized to result from virus-induced immunomodulation. Therefore, we studied the effects of CMV reactivation on the temporal course of host response biomarkers in patients with sepsis. METHODS: In this matched cohort study, each sepsis patient developing CMV reactivation between day 3 and 17 (CMV+) was compared with one CMV seropositive patient without reactivation (CMVs+) and one CMV seronegative patient (CMVs−). CMV serostatus and plasma loads were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassays and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Systemic interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-18, interferon-gamma–induced protein-10 (IP-10), neutrophilic elastase, IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA), and IL-10 were measured at five time points by multiplex immunoassay. The effects of CMV reactivation on sequential concentrations of these biomarkers were assessed in multivariable mixed models. RESULTS: Among 64 CMV+ patients, 45 could be matched to CMVs+ or CMVs− controls or both. The two baseline characteristics and host response biomarker levels at viremia onset were similar between groups. CMV+ patients had increased IP-10 on day 7 after viremia onset (symmetric percentage difference +44% versus −15% when compared with CMVs+ and +37% versus +4% when compared with CMVs−) and decreased IL-1RA (−41% versus 0% and −49% versus +10%, respectively). However, multivariable analyses did not show an independent association between CMV reactivation and time trends of IL-6, IP-10, IL-10, or IL-1RA. CONCLUSION: CMV reactivation was not independently associated with changes in the temporal trends of host response biomarkers in comparison with non-reactivating patients. Therefore, these markers should not be used as surrogate clinical endpoints for interventional studies evaluating anti-CMV therapy.

To maintain the breadth of antibodies necessary for clinical protection, it is important to understand regional patterns of antibody seroprevalence in source plasma from which IG products are manufactured. In this study, source plasma from donation centers in various locations of the Southwestern quarter of the United States was surveyed for antibody titers to hepatitis A virus (HAV), measles virus (MeV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). A broad range of anti-HAV Ig plasma titers was observed among these centers, with some centers exhibiting 3–5 times the titers of the others. Minor to no differences were observed for levels of anti-MeV and anti-CMV, respectively. Importantly, elevated anti-HAV Ig titers were broadly observed across plasma units obtained from the centers exhibiting high titers, indicative of a potential regional phenomenon among donors as opposed to few donors with singularly high titers. Plasma from these high-titer centers conferred significantly greater neutralization against HAV in vitro. The outcomes of this study give a glimpse of the antibody diversity inherent in human plasma used to manufacture IG products..","Ciencewicki, Jonathan M.; Schouest, Katherine R.; Gierman, Todd M.; Vandeberg, Peter J.; Gooch, Barry D.",Sci Rep,565,1

This lack of clarity plus an ill-defined process for ensuring intraoperative antibiotic redosing resulted in a compliance rate of 11%. The organization’s surgical site infection (SSI) rate was 3.19%, above the national benchmark of 1.87%. The primary project goal was to increase intraoperative antibiotic redosing compliance. The secondary project goal was to decrease SSIs. METHODS: With recommendations from the Infectious Disease Society of America, we developed new organizational redosing guidelines, as well as a new antibiotic-specific reminder alert in the electronic medical record. Implementation of the new guidelines and processes occurred after providing education to the anesthesiologists, surgeons, and circulating nurses. Monthly evaluation of data allowed for quick recognition of oversights followed by the initiation of process updates. RESULTS: Data showed that the initial compliance rate for the intraoperative redosing of antibiotics was 11%. Following interventions, compliance has reached and sustained an average of 99%. Survey results show that provider knowledge of the guidelines and process has improved. Though not directly related, the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program observed that the SSI rate decreased from 3.19% in 2014 to 2.3% in 2018. CONCLUSIONS: This project demonstrates that comprehensive education along with antibiotic-specific electronic medical record alerts significantly increased the compliance of intraoperative antibiotic redosing at Children’s Hospital & Medical Center. Continuous education and monthly updates sustained results for over 40 months.","LeRiger, Michelle M.; Phipps, Amber R.; Norton, Bridget M.; Spitznagel, Rachel A.",Pediatr Qual Saf,565,1

METHODS: A retrospective case–control study of patients with severe infection who were treated with tigecycline was conducted. Patients were assigned to the hypofibrinogenaemia group (< 2.0 g/L) and normal fibrinogen (normal) group (≥ 2.0 g/L) to assess the clinical features of patients with tigecycline-associated hypofibrinogenaemia. The traits of patients treated with cefoperazone/sulbactam in the hypofibrinogenaemia group were also analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 127 patients were enrolled in the study, including 71 patients with hypofibrinogenaemia and 56 patients with normal fibrinogen levels. Hypofibrinogenaemia developed at a median of 6 (4–8) days after tigecycline treatment, and the fibrinogen level returned to normal at a median of 3 (3–5) days after tigecycline discontinuation. In the multivariate analysis, intra-abdominal infection (p = 0.005), fibrinogen level at tigecycline initiation (p < 0.001), maintenance dose (p = 0.039), and treatment duration (p = 0.002) were found to be related to hypofibrinogenaemia. Treatment with cefoperazone/sulbactam was not associated with hypofibrinogenaemia (p = 0.681), but patients treated with cefoperazone/sulbactam had a higher incidence of coagulopathy (p = 0.009) and needed more blood products (p = 0.003) than those treated without cefoperazone/sulbactam. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline-associated hypofibrinogenaemia often developed on the 6th (4th–8th) day of tigecycline use and was associated with intra-abdominal infection, fibrinogen level at tigecycline initiation, maintenance dose, and treatment duration of tigecycline but not cefoperazone/sulbactam.","Hu, Juan; Xiao, Yong-hong; Zheng, Yi; Lai, Yang-xiao; Fang, Xue-ling; Fang, Qiang",Eur J Clin Pharmacol,565,27

Growing evidence suggests that exposure to HAP disproportionately affects mothers and children and can increase risks of adverse birth outcomes. We aimed to quantify the association between HAP and adverse birth outcomes of stillbirth, preterm births, and low birth weight while controlling for geographic variability. This study is based on a cross-sectional survey of 127,545 birth records from 41,821 individual women collected as part of the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) covering 2013–2018. We developed Bayesian structured additive regression models based on Bayesian splines for adverse birth outcomes. Our model includes the mother’s level and household characteristics while correcting for spatial effects and multiple births per mother. Model parameters and inferences were based on a fully Bayesian approach via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. We observe that unclean fuel is the primary source of cooking for 89.3% of the 41,821 surveyed women in the 2018 NDHS. Of all pregnancies, 14.9% resulted in at least one adverse birth outcome; 14.3% resulted in stillbirth, 7.3% resulted in an underweight birth, and 1% resulted in premature birth. We found that the risk of stillbirth is significantly higher for mothers using unclean cooking fuel. However, exposure to unclean fuel was not significantly associated with low birth weight and preterm birth. Mothers who attained at least primary education had reduced risk of stillbirth, while the risk of stillbirth increased with the increasing age of the mother. Mothers living in the Northern states had a significantly higher risk of adverse births outcomes in 2018. Our results show that decreasing national levels of adverse birth outcomes depends on working toward addressing the disparities between states.","Roberman, Jamie; Emeto, Theophilus I.; Adegboye, Oyelola A.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,565,1

Unfortunately, not many treatment options are available to TBI patients. Therefore, knowledge of the complex interplay between gut microbiome (GM) and brain health may shed novel insights as it is a rapidly expanding field of research around the world. Recent studies show that GM plays important roles in shaping neurogenerative processes such as blood-brain-barrier (BBB), myelination, neurogenesis, and microglial maturation. In addition, GM is also known to modulate many aspects of neurological behavior and cognition; however, not much is known about the role of GM in brain injuries. Since GM has been shown to improve cellular and molecular functions via mitigating TBI-induced pathologies such as BBB permeability, neuroinflammation, astroglia activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, herein we discuss how a dysbiotic gut environment, which in fact, contributes to central nervous system (CNS) disorders during brain injury and how to potentially ward off these harmful effects. We further opine that a better understanding of GM-brain (GMB) axis could help assist in designing better treatment and management strategies in future for the patients who are faced with limited options.","George, Akash K.; Behera, Jyotirmaya; Homme, Rubens P.; Tyagi, Neetu; Tyagi, Suresh C.; Singh, Mahavir",Mol Neurobiol,565,13

RF and RNN both show high performance in predicting hourly PM(10) using only gaseous air pollutants (SO(2), NO(2) and CO) as inputs, showing the predominance of the secondary inorganic aerosol and implying the existence of thermodynamic equilibrium between gaseous air pollutants and PM(10). Also, we find the following results. The correlation of gaseous air pollutants and PM(10) were more relevant than that of meteorological conditions and PM(10). CO was the predominant factor for PM(10) in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Plain and the Yangtze River Delta while SO(2) and NO(2) were also important features for PM(10) in the Pearl River Delta and Sichuan Basin. The spatial heterogeneity and temporal homogeneity of PM(10) in China are revealed. The long-range transported PM(10) was substantiated to be insignificant, except in the sandstorms. The severity of PM(10) was attributable to the lopsided shift of thermodynamic equilibrium and the phenology of indigenous flora.","Feng, Rui; Zhou, Rong; Shi, Weiwei; Shi, Nanjing; Fang, Xuekun",Sci Rep,565,1

In this study, we built a SEL framework and a SEL measurement tool from the ground up that assess children's development of skills with communities of the Baka ethnic group in Cameroon. We conducted a participatory and interactive study to develop a SEL framework and measurement tool that is specific to the context of indigenous Baka communities in Cameroon. Using a quick ethnography methodology and an emic approach, a researcher team comprised mainly of Baka community members engaged parents, teachers, and others in iterative cycles of data collection, analysis, and reflection to develop the framework and assessments. The resulting Baka SEL framework includes skills and domains distinct from predominant SEL frameworks, underscoring the importance of drawing SEL priorities from communities themselves. Shared foundational constructs underlying the Baka SEL framework and other frameworks indicate possible universal human expectations for emotional and relational skills. Two SEL measurement tools were produced: a caregiver tool and a teacher tool, each using storytelling to elicit specific, honest, and detailed information about child behavior. These tools allow us to capture child behavior in the school and the home, and to collect data on all participating children within a specific time period. The described approach is a simple, practical, and culturally appropriate strategy for collaborating with rural communities to articulate their understanding of SEL. The resulting framework and tools illustrate the importance of rooting SEL in local culture, while the approach to developing them serves as a model for other early childhood care and education organizations and programs.","Anziom, Brigitte; Strader, Sarah; Sanou, Anselme Simeon; Chew, Philip",Front Public Health,565,27

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy are largely understood as genetic diseases of sarcomere or desmosome proteins, respectively. In contrast, >250 genes spanning >10 gene ontologies have been implicated in DCM, representing a complex and diverse genetic architecture. To clarify this, a systematic curation of evidence to establish the relationship of genes with DCM was conducted. METHODS: An international panel with clinical and scientific expertise in DCM genetics evaluated evidence supporting monogenic relationships of genes with idiopathic DCM. The panel used the Clinical Genome Resource semiquantitative gene-disease clinical validity classification framework with modifications for DCM genetics to classify genes into categories on the basis of the strength of currently available evidence. Representation of DCM genes on clinically available genetic testing panels was evaluated. RESULTS: Fifty-one genes with human genetic evidence were curated. Twelve genes (23%) from 8 gene ontologies were classified as having definitive (BAG3, DES, FLNC, LMNA, MYH7, PLN, RBM20, SCN5A, TNNC1, TNNT2, TTN) or strong (DSP) evidence. Seven genes (14%; ACTC1, ACTN2, JPH2, NEXN, TNNI3, TPM1, VCL) including 2 additional ontologies were classified as moderate evidence; these genes are likely to emerge as strong or definitive with additional evidence. Of these 19 genes, 6 were similarly classified for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 3 for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Of the remaining 32 genes (63%), 25 (49%) had limited evidence, 4 (8%) were disputed, 2 (4%) had no disease relationship, and 1 (2%) was supported by animal model data only. Of the 16 evaluated clinical genetic testing panels, most definitive genes were included, but panels also included numerous genes with minimal human evidence. CONCLUSIONS: In the curation of 51 genes, 19 had high evidence (12 definitive/strong, 7 moderate). It is notable that these 19 genes explain only a minority of cases, leaving the remainder of DCM genetic architecture incompletely addressed. Clinical genetic testing panels include most high-evidence genes; however, genes lacking robust evidence are also commonly included. We recommend that high-evidence DCM genes be used for clinical practice and that caution be exercised in the interpretation of variants in variable-evidence DCM genes.","Jordan, Elizabeth; Peterson, Laiken; Ai, Tomohiko; Asatryan, Babken; Bronicki, Lucas; Brown, Emily; Celeghin, Rudy; Edwards, Matthew; Fan, Judy; Ingles, Jodie; James, Cynthia A.; Jarinova, Olga; Johnson, Renee; Judge, Daniel P.; Lahrouchi, Najim; Lekanne Deprez, Ronald H.; Lumbers, R.

Decision-making deficits have been associated with EDs. Decision-making learning deficits denote a lack of strategies to elaborate better decisions that can have an impact on recovery and response to treatment. This study used the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) to investigate learning differences related to treatment outcome in EDs, comparing between patients with a good and bad treatment outcome and healthy controls. Likewise, the predictive role of impaired learning performance on therapy outcome was explored. Four hundred twenty-four participants (233 ED patients and 191 healthy controls) participated in this study. Decision making was assessed using the Iowa Gambling Task before any psychological treatment. All patients received psychological therapy, and treatment outcome was evaluated at discharge. Patients with bad outcome did not show progression in the decision-making task as opposed to those with good outcome and the healthy control sample. Additionally, learning performance in the decision-making task was predictive of their future outcome. The severity of learning deficits in decision making may serve as a predictor of the treatment. These results may provide a starting point of how decision-making learning deficits are operating as dispositional and motivational factors on responsiveness to treatment in EDs.","Lucas, Ignacio; Miranda-Olivos, Romina; Testa, Giulia; Granero, Roser; Sánchez, Isabel; Sánchez-González, Jessica; Jiménez-Murcia, Susana; Fernández-Aranda, Fernando",Nutrients,565,1

Infection of cells with H. pylori is dependent on lipid rafts, which are cholesterol-rich microdomains located in the cell membrane. H. pylori cholesterol-α-glucosyltransferase (CGT) catalyzes the conversion of membrane cholesterol to cholesteryl glucosides, which can be incorporated into the bacterial cell wall, facilitating evasion from immune defense and colonization in the host. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this process remain to be explored. In this study, we discovered for the first time that H. pylori CGT could promote adherence to gastric epithelial cells in a cholesterol-dependent manner. Externalization of cell membrane phosphatidylserine (PS) is crucial for enhancement of binding of H. pylori to cells by CGT and for cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA)-induced pathogenesis. Furthermore, exogenous cholesterol interferes with the actions of H. pylori CGT to catalyze cellular cholesterol, which impedes bacterial binding to cells and attenuates subsequent inflammation, indicating that the initial attachment of H. pylori to cells is closely dependent on host cholesterol. These results provide evidence that CGT contributes to H. pylori infectivity and it may serve as a key target for the treatment of H. pylori-associated diseases.","Hsu, Chung-Yao; Yeh, Jia-Yin; Chen, Chun-Ya; Wu, Hui-Yu; Chiang, Meng-Hsuan; Wu, Chia-Lin; Lin, Hwai-Jeng; Chiu, Cheng-Hsun; Lai, Chih-Ho",,565,3

FOXN3 expression patterns in clinical tissue specimens were characterized via qPCR and Western blotting. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was applied to assess the correlation between FOXN3 expression and overall survival. Effects of FOXN3 over-expression and depletion on glioma cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were assessed by CCK8, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, scratch wound healing assay and Transwell invasion assay, respectively. Moreover, the involvement of AKT/murine double minute 2 (MDM2)/p53 pathway was evaluated. Additionally, tumor transplantation model assay was performed to determine the effects of FOXN3 over-expression on glioma cell growth in vivo. Results showed that FOXN3 was significantly down-regulated in glioma tissues compared with normal tissues. Patients with lower FOXN3 expression exhibited a shorter overall survival time. Gain- and loss-of-function analyses demonstrated that FOXN3 over-expression significantly suppressed proliferation, survival and motility of glioma cells, whereas FOXN3 knockdown remarkably promoted glioma cell proliferation, survival and motility. Furthermore, FOXN3 over-expression inhibited the activation of AKT/MDM2/p53 signaling pathway in glioma cells, while FOXN3 depletion facilitated its activation. Additionally, tumor xenograft assays revealed that FOXN3 over-expression retarded glioma cell growth in vivo. Collectively, these findings indicate that FOXN3 inhibits cell growth and invasion through inactivating the AKT/MDM2/p53 signaling pathway and that FOXN3-AKT/MDM2/p53 axis may represent a novel therapeutic target for glioma patients.","Wang, Chaojia; Tu, Hanjun; Yang, Ling; Ma, Chunming; Hu, Juntao; Luo, Jie; Wang, Hui",Aging (Albany NY),565,1

The approach enables discontinuous transformation fields and also features an automatically computed crack indicator function and therefore does not require a pre-segmentation. The new approach is a generalization of the commonly used variational image registration approach. New contributions are an additional dissipation term in the overall energy, a proper balancing of different ingredients, and a joint optimization for both, the crack indicator function and the transformation.

Despite the availability of effective (non)pharmacological treatments, symptoms persist in a significant amount of patients with IBS. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may be an effective alternative treatment in adolescents with refractory IBS through manipulation of the intestinal microbiota. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This randomised, placebo-controlled single-centre pilot study will assess feasibility and efficacy of FMT in 30 adolescents (16–21 years) with refractory IBS. Patients will be randomly allocated (1:1) to receive two allogeneic (healthy donor) or two autologous (own) faecal infusions at baseline and after 6 weeks. Primary outcomes will assess feasibility, including patient and donor recruitment, adherence and incidence rates of adverse events. To evaluate clinical efficacy, secondary outcomes will include the proportion of patients with at least >50% reduction of their abdominal pain intensity and frequency 12 weeks after the first FMT, and after 6-month and 12-month follow-up. Other outcomes comprise changes in faecal gut microbiota composition, quality of life, depression and anxiety, school or work absenteeism and adequate relief, measured directly after FMTs and after 6 and 12 months of follow-up.

Children are one of the most susceptible groups for severe influenza. Clinical differentiation between viral and bacterial pneumonia is difficult to assess in children, so the aid of the complete blood count (CBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are used to differentiate between them. However, differential diagnosis between influenza-positive and -negative viral pneumonia is difficult. CRP levels have been found to be higher in H1N1 influenza adult patients. However, there are no studies regarding CBC, and CRP levels in pediatric patients with influenza-positive and -negative pneumonia. METHODS: From 2011 to 2016, we found children less than 18 years old with viral pneumonia who had positive viral RT–PCR test for adenovirus, bocavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Means for white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes and CRP were calculated. Comparisons between influenza and other respiratory viral pneumonia WBC and CRP means were made. Student’s t-test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: We analyzed 183 patients with positive viral pneumonia cases; of which, 37 (20.2%) had two viruses detected. Mean age was 1 year old and 56.5% were male. Viral detections were rhinovirus 75 (40.9%), RSV 45 (24.5%), influenza 31 (16.9%), metapneumovirus 30 (16.3%), bocavirus 20 (10.9%), parainfluenza 14 (7.6%), coronavirus 3 (1.6%) and adenovirus 2 (1.1%). Mean influenza WBC were 10,900 ± 2040/μL, neutrophils were 6998 ± 1510/μL, lymphocytes 2882 ± 826/μL and CRP 5.41 ± 1.9 mg/dL. Mean influenza negative, viral-positive pneumonia were WBC 12227 ± 868/μL, neutrophils 6787 ± 696/μL, lymphocytes 4469 ± 426/μL, CRP 2.81 ± 0.56 mg/dL. Lower lymphocyte counts (P = 0.002) and higher CRP levels (P = 0.019) were found in patients with influenza comparing them with pneumonia caused by other viruses. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, children with positive influenza pneumonia showed lower levels of lymphocytes and higher levels of CRP compared with negative influenza. Lower lymphocyte counts and high CRP levels have been found in influenza-positive patients mainly in adult studies. In children with suspected influenza pneumonia, lower lymphocyte counts and higher CRP levels can aid clinical diagnosis before molecular confirmation in influenza pneumonia.","Cristerna Tarrasa, G H; González Saldaña, N; Hernández Porras, M; Fortes Gutiérrez, S",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,565,26

This innovative technology has become increasingly common in practical implementation. However, empirical support has not kept pace with the robots’ growing popularity. The present study set out to provide an empirical test of the stress-buffering capability of this technology. We examined the effects of the presence of an SAR on self-reported measures of stress in a community sample of 70 children (40 girls, 30 boys) between the ages of 7 and 10 years old. Child participants were randomly assigned to either a robot-present or a robot-absent condition during the Trier Social Stress Test for Children. Contrary to our predictions, we did not detect a stress-buffering effect of the presence of the robot. Instead, the primary analysis showed that the robot’s presence led to a larger decrease in positive affect following the task. However, further analyses found no significant difference in positive affect when accounting for baseline group differences. Exploratory analyses of the nature of children’s interactions with the SAR during the stressful task found that higher levels of parent-reported social anxiety were associated with greater prosocial behaviors towards the SAR, thus signifying a potential target for future interventions. Further work on SARs is needed to determine the optimal timing and robotic specifications that would maximize the potential of this developing technology to improve children’s mental health care.","Kitt, Elizabeth R.; Crossman, Molly K.; Matijczak, Angela; Burns, Gillian B.; Kazdin, Alan E.",J Child Fam Stud,565,16

The aim of the study was to analyze possible microstructural alteration in the penumbra and their association with clinical symptoms as well as angiographic reperfusion success in patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy for large-vessel occlusions in the anterior circulation and who received an admission CT perfusion together with postinterventional DTIs were included (n = 65). Angiographic reperfusion success by means of modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) scale and clinical outcome were recorded. Microstructural integrity was assessed by DTI evaluating the mean diffusivity index within the salvaged gray matter of the former penumbra. RESULTS The mean diffusivity index was higher in completely recanalized patients (mTICI 3: -0.001 ± 0.034 versus mTICI <3: -0.030 ± 0.055, P = .03). There was a positive correlation between the mean diffusivity index and NIHSS score improvement (r = 0.49, P = .003) and the mean diffusivity index was associated with midterm functional outcome (r = -0.37, P = .04) after adjustment for confounders. In mediation analysis, the mean diffusivity index and infarction growth mediated the association between reperfusion success and clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS The macroscopic salvaged penumbra included areas of microstructural integrity changes, most likely related to the initial hypoperfusion. These abnormalities were found early after mechanical thrombectomy, were dependent on angiographic results, and correlated with the clinical outcome. When confirmed, these findings prompt the evaluation of therapies for protection of the penumbral tissue integrity.","Berndt, M T; Maegerlein, C; Boeckh-Behrens, T; Wunderlich, S; Zimmer, C; Wirth, S; Mück, F G; Mönch, S; Friedrich, B; Kaesmacher, J",AJNR.

METHODS Systematic searches of electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PEDro) 1996-2019 were conducted to identify randomised controlled trials of exercise for pelvic or lower limb fragility fractures. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts. One reviewer extracted data, a second verified. Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias. Intervention reporting quality was based on TIDieR, assessed by one reviewer and verified by a second. Narrative synthesis was undertaken. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42017060905. RESULTS Searches identified 37 trials including 3564 participants, median sample size 81 (IQR 48-124), participants aged 81 years (IQR 79-82) and 76% (2536/3356) female. All trials focussed on people with hip fracture except one on ankle fracture. Exercise types focussed on resistance exercise in 14 trials, weight bearing exercise in 5 trials, 13 varied dose of sessions with health professionals, and 2 trials each focussed on treadmill gait training, timing of weight bearing or aerobic exercise. 30/37 (81%) of trials reported adequate sequence generation, 25/37 (68%) sufficient allocation concealment. 10/37 (27%) trials lacked outcome assessor blinding. Of 65 exercise interventions, reporting was clear for 33 (51%) in terms of when started, 61 (94%) for where delivered, 49 (75%) for who delivered, 47 (72%) for group or individual, 29 (45%) for duration, 46 (71%) for session frequency, 8 (12%) for full prescription details to enable the exercises to be reproduced, 32 (49%) clearly reported tailoring or modification, and 23 (35%) reported exercise adherence. Subjectively assessed mobility was assessed in 22/37 (59%) studies and 29/37 (78%) used an objective measure. CONCLUSIONS All trials focussed on hip fracture, apart from one ankle fracture trial. Research into pelvic and other lower limb fragility fractures is indicated. A range of exercise types were investigated but to date deficiencies in intervention reporting hamper reproducibility. Adoption of TIDieR and CERT guidelines should improve intervention reporting as use increases. Trials would be improved by consistent blinded outcome assessor use and with consensus on which mobility outcomes should be assessed.","Keene, David J; Forde, Colin; Sugavanam, Thavapriya; Williams, Mark A; Lamb, Sarah E",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,565,1

Compared with the highly virulent U.S. PEDV strain PC21A, the tissue culture-adapted PC177 (TC-PC177) contains a 197-amino-acid (aa) deletion in the N-terminal domain of the spike (S) protein. We orally inoculated neonatal, conventional suckling piglets with TC-PC177 or PC21A to compare their pathogenicities. Within 7 days postinoculation, TC-PC177 caused mild diarrhea and lower fecal viral RNA shedding, with no mortality, whereas PC21A caused severe clinical signs and 55% mortality. To investigate whether infection with TC-PC177 can induce cross-protection against challenge with a highly virulent PEDV strain, all the surviving piglets were challenged with PC21A at 3 weeks postinoculation. Compared with 100% protection in piglets initially inoculated with PC21A, 88% and 100% TC-PC177- and mock-inoculated piglets had diarrhea following challenge, respectively, indicating incomplete cross-protection. To investigate whether this 197-aa deletion was the determinant for the attenuation of TC-PC177, we generated a mutant (icPC22A-S1Δ197) bearing the 197-aa deletion from an infectious cDNA clone of the highly virulent PEDV PC22A strain (infectious clone PC22A, icPC22A). In neonatal gnotobiotic pigs, the icPC22A-S1Δ197 virus caused mild to moderate diarrhea, lower titers of viral shedding, and no mortality, whereas the icPC22A virus caused severe diarrhea and 100% mortality. Our data indicate that deletion of this 197-aa fragment in the spike protein can attenuate a highly virulent PEDV, but the virus may lose important epitopes for inducing robust protective immunity.IMPORTANCE The emerging, highly virulent PEDV strains have caused substantial economic losses worldwide. However, the virulence determinants are not established. In this study, we found that a 197-aa deletion in the N-terminal region of the S protein did not alter virus (TC-PC177) tissue tropism but reduced the virulence of the highly virulent PEDV strain PC22A in neonatal piglets. We also demonstrated that the primary infection with TC-PC177 failed to induce complete cross-protection against challenge by the highly virulent PEDV PC21A, suggesting that the 197-aa region may contain important epitopes for inducing protective immunity. Our results provide an insight into the role of this large deletion in virus propagation and pathogenicity. In addition, the reverse genetics platform of the PC22A strain was further optimized for the rescue of recombinant PEDV viruses in vitro This breakthrough allows us to investigate other virulence determinants of PEDV strains and will provide knowledge leading to better control PEDV infections.","Hou, Yixuan; Lin, Chun-Ming; Yokoyama, Masaru; Yount, Boyd L; Marthaler, Douglas; Douglas, Arianna L; Ghimire, Shristi; Qin, Yibin; Baric, Ralph S; Saif, Linda J; Wang, Qiuhong",Journal of virology,565,5

Identifying predictors of abuse would enable focused screening and may increase weight management success. METHODS We analyzed data from 500 consecutively recruited obese subjects from a population-based, regional bariatric program. The prevalence of self-reported sexual abuse was ascertained using a single interview question. Health status was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify sexual abuse predictors. RESULTS The mean age was 43.7 y (SD 9.6), 441 (88.2%) were females, 458 (91.8%) were white, and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 47.9 kg/m(2) (SD 8.1). The self-reported prevalence of past abuse was 21.8% (95% CI 18.4-25.4%). Abused subjects had worse health status (VAS score 53.1 (SD 21.2) versus 58.0 (SD 20.1), P = 0.03). BMI was not associated with abuse (P > 0.5). Age, sex, BMI, and covariate-adjusted independent predictors of abuse included alcohol addiction (adjusted odds ratio 15.8; 95% CI 4.0-62.8), posttraumatic stress disorder (4.9; 2.5-9.5), borderline personality (3.8; 1.0-13.8), depression (2.4; 1.3-4.3), and lower household income (3.4; 1.6-7.0). CONCLUSIONS Abuse was common amongst obese patients managed in a population-based bariatric program; alcohol addiction, psychiatric comorbidities, and low-income status were highly associated with sexual abuse.","Gabert, Danielle L; Majumdar, Sumit R; Sharma, Arya M; Rueda-Clausen, Christian F; Klarenbach, Scott W; Birch, Daniel W; Karmali, Shahzeer; McCargar, Linda; Fassbender, Konrad; Padwal, Raj S",Journal of obesity,565,33

Methods: Data from a single center was analyzed retrospectively. Patients had received preliminary standard of intensive care (SIC) according to a local treatment algorithm, either alone or along with Octagam 5% at 30 g/day for 5 days. Both groups were compared regarding baseline characteristics, survival, and changes in inflammation markers. Imbalance in baseline APACHE II scores was addressed by propensity score matching. Otherwise, Kaplan-Meier and multiple logistic regression models were used. Results: Out of 93 patients, 51 had received Octagam and 42 had not. About 75% of patients were male and both groups had comparable body mass index and AB0 blood type distribution. Octagam-treated patients were younger (mean 65 ± 15 versus 71 ± 15 years, p = 0.066) and had slightly lower baseline disease scores (APACHE II: 20.6 versus 22.4, p = 0.281; SOFA: 5.0 versus 7.0, p = 0.006). Overall survival was 61% in the SIC + Octagam and 38% in the SIC only group (odds ratio: 2.2, 95% confidence interval: 0.9-5.4, p = 0.091 after controlling for baseline imbalances). Octagam significantly prolonged median survival time (68 versus 18 days, p = 0.014) and significantly reduced plasma levels of C-reactive protein (median change from baseline -71.5 versus -0.3 mg/L, p = 0.049). Conclusion: Clinically relevant benefits through adjunct Octagam treatment in COVID-19 need to be confirmed in a randomized, controlled trial.","Esen, Figen; Özcan, Perihan E; Orhun, Günseli; Polat, Özlem; Anaklı, İlkay; Alay, Gülçin; Tuna, Verda; Çeliksoy, Emre; Kılıç, Mehmet; Mercan, Mutlu; Tukek, Tufan",Current medical research and opinion,565,1

BACKGROUND The preferred organ used for reconstruction after esophagectomy for cancer is the stomach. Previous studies attempted to define the optimal site of anastomosis and anastomotic techniques. However, anastomotic stricture formation and leakage still remain an important clinical problem. METHODS From May 2005 to September 2007, 128 patients (64 in each group) were randomized between ETE and ETS anastomosis after esophagectomy for cancer with gastric tube reconstruction. Routine contrast swallow studies and endoscopy were performed. Anastomotic stricture within 1 year, requiring dilatation, was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were anastomotic leak rate and mortality. RESULTS Ninety-nine men and 29 women underwent esophagectomy and gastric tube reconstruction. Benign stenosis of the anastomosis, for which dilatation was required, occurred more often in the ETE group (40% vs. ETS 18%, P < 0.01) after 1 year of follow-up. The overall (clinical and radiological) anastomotic leak rate was lower in the ETE group (22% vs. ETS 41%, P = 0.04). Patients with an ETE anastomosis suffered less often from pneumonia; 17% versus ETS 44%, P = 0.002 and had subsequently significantly shorter in-hospital stay (15 days vs. 22 days, P = 0.02). In-hospital mortality did not differ between both groups. CONCLUSION ETS anastomosis is associated with a lower anastomotic stricture rate, compared to ETE anastomosis. However, prevention of stricture formation was at high costs with increased anastomotic leakage and longer in-hospital stay. This study is registered with the Dutch Trial Registry and carries the ID number OND1317772.","Nederlof, Nina; Tilanus, Hugo W; Tran, T C Khe; Hop, Wim C J; Wijnhoven, Bas P L; de Jonge, Jeroen",Annals of surgery,565,5

Therefore, it is important to study how the mechanical properties of woven bone are dependent on its microarchitecture and especially on its porosity and mineral content. The porosity and the x-ray greyscale of specimens taken from bone transport studies in sheep were assessed by means of ex vivo imaging. Our study demonstrates that the porosity of the woven bone in the distraction area diminishes during the healing process from 73.3% 35 days after surgery to 31.9% 525 days after surgery. In addition, the woven bone's porosity is negatively correlated with its Young's modulus. The x-ray greyscale, was measured as an indicator of the level of mineralization of the woven bone. Greyscale index has been demonstrated to be inversely proportional to porosity and to increase to up to 60-80% of the level in cortical bone. The results of this study may contribute to the development of micromechanical models of woven bone and improvements in in silico modelling.","Mora-Macías, J; García-Florencio, P; Pajares, A; Miranda, P; Domínguez, J; Reina-Romo, E",Annals of biomedical engineering,565,1

METHODOLOGY This retrospective ecological study was carried out using Brazilian municipality data obtained from the information systems of the National Public Health System. The outcomes were medical appointments, prenatal procedures and diabetes care. The exposure variable was the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on the first case reported in Brazil. Multilevel mixed-effects negative binomial regression was used to analyze the association between the number of procedures per 10,000 inhabitants and COVID-19. RESULTS Data from 5,564 Brazilian municipalities were included in the present study. Regarding medical appointments, the largest reduction occasioned by the pandemic occurred in May (IRR = 0.27, 95%CI 0.24 - 0.30). Prenatal procedures were reduced by 65% (IRR = 0.35, 95%CI 0.32 - 0.38), also in May. In addition, diabetes care saw the biggest reductions in April 2020 (IRR = 0.24, 95%CI 0.11 - 0.53) and May 2020 (IRR = 0.19, 95%CI 0.09 - 0.43).

The objective of this study was to analyze the outcome of hand-sewn end-to-end versus end-to-side cervical esophagogastric anastomoses. METHODS A series of 390 consecutive patients who underwent esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction was analyzed. RESULTS The end-to-end technique was performed in 112 (29 %) patients and the end-to-side in 278 (71 %) patients. Anastomotic leakage occurred in 20 (18 %) patients with an end-to-end anastomosis versus 58 (21 %) patients with an end-to-side anastomosis (p = 0.50). A higher incidence in anastomotic strictures was seen in end-to-end anastomoses (48 (43 %)) compared with end-to-side anastomoses (89 (32 %); p = 0.04). Moreover, a median of 11 (7-17) dilations was necessary in patients with a benign anastomotic stricture in the end-to-end group compared with four (2-8) dilations in patients with a benign anastomotic stricture in the end-to-end group (p < 0.036). After multivariate analysis, the difference in anastomotic leakage rates remained nonsignificant (p = 0.74), whereas anastomotic stricture rate and number of dilations were higher in the end-to-end group (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION The technique of anastomosis is not significantly related to anastomotic leakage rate. However, patients with end-to-end anastomoses develop postoperative strictures more frequently, requiring a higher number of dilations compared to end-to-side anastomoses.","Haverkamp, Leonie; van der Sluis, Pieter C; Verhage, Roy J J; Siersema, Peter D; Ruurda, Jelle P; van Hillegersberg, Richard",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,565,31

A total of 68 patients (52 males; mean age: 60 ± 12 years, 58 paroxysmal AF) were included, and a total of 272 veins were mapped. Fourth-generation cryoballoon with the new spiral mapping catheter (SMC) was used in 35 patients (51%).

A common postoperative complication associated with this procedure is screw loosening. It has been shown that patient-specific screw fixation can be automated to match standard clinical practice and that failure can be estimated preoperatively using computed tomography images. Hence, we set out to optimize three-dimensional preoperative planning to achieve more mechanically robust screw purchase allowing deviation from intuitive, standard screw parameters. Toward this purpose, we employed a genetic algorithm optimization to find optimal screw sizes and trajectories by maximizing the CT derived bone mechanical properties. The method was tested on cadaveric lumbar vertebrae (L1 to L5) of four human spines (2 female/2 male; age range 60-78 years). The main boundary conditions were the predefined, level-dependent areas of possible screw entry points, as well as the automatically located pedicle structures. Finite element analysis was used to compare the genetic algorithm output to standard clinical planning of screw positioning in terms of the simulated pull-out strength. The genetic algorithm optimization successfully found screw sizes and trajectories that maximize the sum of the Young's modulus within the screw's volume for all 40 pedicle screws included in this study. Overall, there was a 26% increase in simulated pull-out strength for optimized compared to traditional screw trajectories and sizes. Our results indicate that optimizing pedicle screw instrumentation in lumbar vertebrae based on bone quality measures improves screw purchase as compared to traditional instrumentation.","Caprara, Sebastiano; Fasser, Marie-Rosa; Spirig, José Miguel; Widmer, Jonas; Snedeker, Jess G; Farshad, Mazda; Senteler, Marco",Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering,565,13

Renin-angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors (RAASi) are often indicated for these patients but may increase the risk for recurrent AKI. Here, we examined whether RAASi associates with a higher risk for recurrent AKI and mortality among survivors of moderate to severe AKI in a retrospective cohort of Veterans who survived Stage II or III AKI. The primary exposure was RAASi at hospital discharge and the primary endpoint was recurrent AKI within 12 months. Cox proportional hazards models were fit on a propensity score-weighted cohort to compare time to recurrent AKI and mortality by RAASi exposure. Among 96,983 patients, 40% were on RAASi at discharge. Compared to patients who continued RAASi use, those discontinuing use experienced no difference in risk for recurrent AKI but had a significantly higher risk of mortality [hazard ratio 1.33 (95% confidence interval1.26-1.41)]. No differences in recurrent AKI risk was observed for non-users started or not on RAASi compared to prevalent users who continued RAASi. Subgroup analyses among those with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and malignancy were similar with exception of a modest reduction in recurrent AKI risk among RAASi discontinuers with chronic kidney disease. Thus, RAASi use among survivors of moderate to severe AKI was associated with little to no difference in risk for recurrent AKI but was associated with improved survival. Reinitiating or starting RAASi among patients with strong indications is warranted but should be balanced with individual overall risk for recurrent AKI and with adequate monitoring.","Siew, Edward D; Parr, Sharidan K; Abdel-Kader, Khaled; Perkins, Amy M; Greevy, Robert A; Vincz, Andrew J; Denton, Jason; Wilson, Otis D; Hung, Adriana M; Ikizler, T Alp; Robinson-Cohen, Cassianne; Matheny, Michael E",Kidney international,565,20

Moreover, estrous cycle-related fluctuations in estrogen levels have been linked with alternating pain sensitivity. Aberrant central circuitry involving both the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the lumbosacral spinal cord has also been implicated in the modulation of visceral pain in clinical and preclinical studies. Here we further investigate changes in visceral pain sensitivity and central glutamatergic systems in rats with respect to estrous cycle and ELS. METHODS We investigated visceral sensitivity in adult female Sprague-Dawley rats, which had undergone maternal separation (MS) in early life or remained non-separated (NS), by performing colorectal distension (CRD). We also assessed excitatory amino acid uptake through excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) in the lumbosacral spinal cord and ACC. RESULTS NS animals in proestrus and estrus exhibited reduced EAAT uptake and decreased threshold to CRD. Moreover, total pain behaviors were increased in these stages. MS rats exhibited lower pain thresholds and higher total pain behaviors to CRD across all stages of the estrous cycle. Interestingly, cortical EAAT function in MS rats was inhibited in the low estrogen state-an effect completely opposite to that seen in NS rats. CONCLUSIONS This data confirms that estrous cycle and ELS are significant factors in visceral sensitivity and fluctuations in EAAT function may be a perpetuating factor mediating central sensitization.","Moloney, Rachel D; Sajjad, Jahangir; Foley, Tara; Felice, Valeria D; Dinan, Timothy G; Cryan, John F; O'Mahony, Siobhain M",Biology of sex differences,565,31

Eligible, consenting patients, regardless of body mass index (BMI), who were undergoing laparotomy for presumed gynecologic malignancy were randomly allocated to standard gauze or negative pressure wound therapy. Patients with BMIs of 40 or greater and benign disease also were eligible. Randomization, stratified by BMI, occurred after skin closure. The primary outcome was wound complication within 30 (±5) days of surgery. A sample size of 343 per group (N=686) was planned. RESULTS From March 1, 2016, to August 20, 2019, we identified 663 potential patients; 289 were randomized to negative pressure wound therapy (254 evaluable participants) and 294 to standard gauze (251 evaluable participants), for a total of 505 evaluable patients. The median age of the entire cohort was 61 years (range 20-87). Four hundred ninety-five patients (98%) underwent laparotomy for malignancy. The trial was eventually stopped for futility after an interim analysis of 444 patients. The rate of wound complications was 17.3% in the negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) group and 16.3% in the gauze group, absolute risk difference 1% (90% CI -4.5 to 6.5%; P=.77).

Benefiting from KOH activation, the PBCKOH was found to possess huge specific surface area of 2183.80 m2/g and many well-developed micropores with average particle size of 2.75 nm and main pore diameters distribution from 1 to 2 nm. The PBCKOH presented an excellent adsorption performance with a theoretical monolayer uptake of 116.97 mg/g for Cr(VI) and a heterogeneous adsorption capacity of 450.43 mg/g for NAP. The uptake equilibrium was attained within about 120 min for Cr(VI), while about 180 min for NAP following avrami fractional-order model, revealing the existence of multiple kinetics during the adsorption. The thermodynamic results showed that the uptake of both Cr(VI) and NAP occurred spontaneously (-ΔG°), while in an endothermic nature for Cr(VI) (+ΔH°) and an exothermic characteristic for NAP (-ΔH°) with different randomness. Furthermore, the PBCKOH was believed to enhance the Cr(VI) adsorption mainly through the combination of electrostatic attraction, complexation, ion exchange and reduction action, while achieving the high NAP uptake by pore filling and π-π stacking interactions.","Qu, Jianhua; Wang, Yuxin; Tian, Xue; Jiang, Zhao; Deng, Fengxia; Tao, Yue; Jiang, Qun; Wang, Lei; Zhang, Ying",Journal of hazardous materials,565,17

Additionally, these models are able to identify patient characteristics which cause alterations in the expected PK/PD profiles and through simulations can recommend changes to dosing which compensate for the differences. In this review, we examine how PK/PD models have been applied to optimize antimalarial dosing recommendations for young children including those who are malnourished, pregnant women and individuals receiving concomitant therapies such as those for HIV treatment. The malaria field has had great success in utilizing PK/PD models as a foundation to update treatment guidelines and propose the next generation of dosing regimens to investigate in clinical trials. We propose how the malaria field can continue to use modeling to improve therapies by further integrating PK data into clinical studies and including data on drug resistance and host immunity in PK/PD models. Finally, we suggest that other disease areas can achieve similar success in applying pharmacometrics to improve outcomes by implementing three key principals.","Hughes, Emma; Wallender, Erika; Ali, Ali Mohamed; Jagannathan, Prasanna; Savic, Radojka M",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,565,19

Thus, estimation of radiation doses achieved during EVAR is of great importance. MATERIAL AND METHODS Organ doses (OD) and effective doses (ED) administered to 17 patients receiving EVAR were determined (1) from the exposure parameters by performing Monte Carlo simulations in mathematical phantoms and (2) by measurements with thermoluminescent dosimeters in a physical anthropomorphic phantom. RESULTS The mean fluoroscopy time was 26 min, the mean dose area product was 24995 cGy cm2. The mean ED was 34.8 mSv, ODs up to 626 mSv were found. Whereas digital subtraction angiographies (DSA) and fluoroscopies each contributed about 50% to the cumulative ED, the ED rates of DSAs were found to be ten times higher than those of fluoroscopies. Doubling of the field size caused an ED rate enhancement up to a factor of 3. CONCLUSION EVAR procedures cause high radiation exposure levels that exceed the values published thus far. As a consequence, (1) DSAs should be only performed when necessary and with a low image rate, (2) fluoroscopies should be kept as short as possible, and (3) field sizes should be minimized. KEY POINTS • During endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) considerable patient doses are achieved. • For each EVAR procedure organ (OD) and effective (ED) doses were determined. • The mean ED was 34.8 mSv, the highest OD was 626 mSv. • Number of DSAs, fluoroscopy durations and field sizes should be minimized.","Foerth, Monika; Seidenbusch, Michael C; Sadeghi-Azandaryani, Mojtaba; Lechel, Ursula; Treitl, Karla Maria; Treitl, Marcus",European radiology,565,4

Meanwhile, cytokines are considered very important factor influencing coronary heart disease (CHD) patient prognosis. So minimization of pulmonary inflammatory responses by reduction of cytokine levels for CHD undergoing lung resection during OLV should be a priority. Because previous studies have demonstrated that lung-protective ventilation (LPV) reduced lung inflammation, this ventilation approach was studied for CHD patients undergoing lung resection here to evaluate the effects of LPV on pulmonary inflammatory responses. Methods This is a single center, randomized controlled trial. Primary endpoint of the study are plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and C-reactive protein (CRP). Secondary endpoints include respiratory variables and hemodynamic variables. 60 CHD patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic lung resection were randomly divided into conventional ventilation group [10 mL/kg Vt and 0 cmH2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), C group] and protective ventilation group (6 mL/kg Vt and 6 cmH2O PEEP, P group; 30 patients/group). Hemodynamic variables, peak inspiratory pressure (Ppeak), dynamic compliance (Cdyn), arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) and arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) were recorded as test data at three time points: T1-endotracheal intubation for two-lung ventilation (TLV) when breathing and hemodynamics were stable; T2-after TLV was substituted with OLV when breathing and hemodynamics were stable; T3-OLV was substituted with TLV at the end of surgery when breathing and hemodynamics were stable. The concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and CRP in patients' blood in both groups at the very beginning of OLV (beginning of OLV) and the end moment of the surgery (end of surgery) were measured. Results The P group exhibited greater PaO2, higher Cdyn and lower Ppeak than the C group at T2, T3 (P<0.05). At the end moment of the surgery, although the P group tended to exhibit higher TNF-α and IL-10 values than the C group, the differences did not reach statistical significance(P=0.0817, P=0.0635). Compared with C group at the end moment of the surgery, IL-6 and CRP were lower in P group, the differences were statistically significant (P=0.0093, P=0.0005). There were no significant differences in hemodynamic variables between the two groups (P>0.05). Conclusions LPV can effectively reduce the airway pressure, improve Cdyn and PaO2, reduce concentrations of IL-6 and CRP during lung resection of CHD patients.Trial registration: The trial was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry.","Liu, Wenjun; Huang, Qian; Lin, Duomao; Zhao, Liyun; Ma, Jun",Journal of thoracic disease,565,2

Digital health and AI applications in medicine and biology are emerging worldwide, not only in resource-rich but also resource-limited regions. AI predates to the mid-20th century, but the current wave of AI builds in part on machine learning (ML), big data, and algorithms that can learn from massive amounts of online user data from patients or healthy persons. There are lessons to be learned from AI applications in different medical specialties and across developed and resource-limited contexts. A case in point is congenital heart defects (CHDs) that continue to plague sub-Saharan Africa, which calls for innovative approaches to improve risk prediction and performance of the available diagnostics. Beyond CHDs, AI in cardiology is a promising context as well. The current suite of digital health applications in CHD and cardiology include complementary technologies such as neural networks, ML, natural language processing and deep learning, not to mention embedded digital sensors. Algorithms that build on these advances are beginning to complement traditional medical expertise while inviting us to redefine the concepts and definitions of expertise in molecular diagnostics and precision medicine. We examine and share here the lessons learned in current attempts to implement AI and digital health in CHD for precision risk prediction and diagnosis in resource-limited settings. These top 10 lessons on AI and digital health summarized in this expert review are relevant broadly beyond CHD in cardiology and medical innovations. As with AI itself that calls for systems approaches to data capture, analysis, and interpretation, both developed and developing countries can usefully learn from their respective experiences as digital health continues to evolve worldwide.","Thomford, Nicholas Ekow; Bope, Christian Domilongo; Agamah, Francis Edem; Dzobo, Kevin; Owusu Ateko, Richmond; Chimusa, Emile; Mazandu, Gaston Kuzamunu; Ntumba, Simon Badibanga; Dandara, Collet; Wonkam, Ambroise",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,565,30

We report our experience with patients with MMAVFs who presented with intracranial hemorrhage. METHODS We reviewed our prospectively maintained endovascular database for patients with MMAVFs, who were treated by embolization during a 15-year period. Hospital and outpatient medical records and imaging studies were reviewed. RESULTS Nine patients with MMAVFs, who presented with intracranial hemorrhage, underwent embolization (mean age 60.3 years, range 21-76; four male and five female). Four patients presented after trauma and five after spontaneous hemorrhage. All nine patients were angiographically cured after embolization of the fistula with liquid embolic agents (n = 8) or coils (n = 1). There were no procedure-related complications. CONCLUSION MMAVFs represent a rarely reported class of vascular lesions. They are typically associated with trauma, but also develop spontaneously, and may be associated with intracranial hemorrhage, which warrants classification of these lesions as high risk. Endovascular treatment is safe and effective and should be considered for these patients, particularly for those who have lesions with intracranial venous drainage.","Almefty, Rami O; Kalani, M Yashar S; Ducruet, Andrew F; Crowley, R Webster; McDougall, Cameron G; Albuquerque, Felipe C",Surgical neurology international,565,16

DESIGN Retrospective study. Setting. Taiwan. POPULATION Women diagnosed with cervical cancer from 1991 to 2005. METHODS Analysis of data from the National Cancer Registration System and National Death Certification System. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Incidence and age at diagnosis of cervical carcinoma and age-specific and overall survival from small cell cervical carcinoma. RESULTS During the study period, 36 122 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer, and 81.8% had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). For the periods 1991-1995, 1996-2000 and 2001-2005, the mean age at diagnosis increased from 53.9 ± 13.3 to 55.0 ± 14.9 and then to 56.7 ± 14.7 years, respectively. The incidence of SCC decreased from 1991 to 2005. During the same period, non-significant increases of adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma were noted. For SCC, occurrence peaked in 1991-1995 in patients 50-59 years of age. From 1996 to 2005, it peaked in patients 40-49 years of age. For cervical adenocarcinoma, occurrence peaked in patients 40-49 years of age, with a steady increase in this age group from 1991 to 2005.

METHODS Included in the study were cats with ISSs undergoing macroscopic surgical removal and subsequent electron beam radiotherapy treatment with either a finely fractionated protocol (48 or 52.8 Gy over 4 weeks delivered in 12 or 16 fractions) or a coarsely fractionated protocol (36 Gy over 3 weeks administered in six fractions). Medical records were reviewed and follow-up information was collected. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to compare the progression-free interval (PFI) between the two protocols and to test the influence of many clinical variables. RESULTS Fifty-nine cats were included; 38 underwent a finely fractionated protocol and 21 a coarsely fractionated protocol. PFI was not significantly different between the two groups. Overall PFI was 2000 days (2000 vs 540 days; P = 0.449). When only first-occurrence cases were included, median PFI was significantly longer in the finely fractionated group compared with the coarsely fractionated group (1430 vs 540 days; P = 0.007). In cats that underwent multiple surgeries PFI was not different between protocols (233 vs 395 days; P = 0.353). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Cats with first-occurrence ISSs appear to benefit from postoperative finely fractionated radiotherapy. The same benefit was not evident in cats that underwent multiple surgeries and we think a coarsely fractionated protocol would be indicated in these cases.","Rossi, Federica; Marconato, Laura; Sabattini, Silvia; Cancedda, Simona; Laganga, Paola; Leone, Vito F; Rohrer Bley, Carla",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,565,5

During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, ECT services have come under pressure or needed to close because of redirected resources and safety reasons. We investigated the impact of C/M-ECT discontinuation on relapse in patients with unipolar depressive disorder in Flanders, Belgium. METHODS Between March 30 and June 18, 2020, all patients receiving C/M-ECT in 2 ECT centers were included. Continuation or maintenance electroconvulsive therapy was discontinued in 33 patients and continued in 4 patients. Relapse was defined as the need to restart ECT or the need for hospitalization. Depressive symptoms were assessed every 3 weeks using the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Clinical Global Impression Scale, and 2 additional patient-rated questions. RESULTS Relapse in the discontinuation group was 60.6%. All 4 patients who continued ECT remained remitted. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed significantly shorter relapse rates for patients receiving bitemporal and/or frequent C/M-ECT (1- to 2-week intervals). Patients older than 60 years showed longer survival rates. CONCLUSIONS Our results confirm earlier prospective and retrospective data regarding the efficacy and importance of C/M-ECT as relapse prevention. After treatment discontinuation, close monitoring of early warning signs for relapse is crucial, especially in the first few months.

Elevation and air quality are believed to be significant factors in the development of the pandemic, but the influence of additional environmental factors remains unclear. METHODS We explored the relationship between the cumulative number of infections and mortality cases with climate (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, water vapor pressure, wind), environmental data (elevation, normalized difference vegetation index or NDVI, particulate matter at 2.5 μm or PM2.5 and NO2 concentration), and population density in Peru. We use confirmed cases of infection from 1,287 districts and mortality in 479 districts, we used Spearman's correlations to assess the bivariate correlation between environmental and climatic factors with cumulative infection cases, cumulative mortality and case-fatality rate. We explored district cases within the ecozones of coast, sierra, high montane forest and lowland rainforest. RESULTS Multiple linear regression models indicate elevation, mean solar radiation, air quality, population density and green vegetation cover, as a socioeconomic proxy, are influential factors in the distribution of infection and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in Peru. Case-fatality rate was weakly associated with elevation. CONCLUSIONS Our results also strongly suggest that exposure to poor air quality is a significant factor in the mortality of individuals below the age of 30. We conclude that environmental and climatic factors do play a significant role in the transmission and case fatality rates in Peru, however further study is required to see if these relationships are maintained over time.","Samillan, Victor J; Flores-León, Diana; Rojas, Eduardo; Zutta, Brian R",Journal of basic and clinical physiology and pharmacology,565,1

We searched 8 electronic databases to identify studies comparing patients receiving a specific protocol of early mobilization to a control group. Methodologic quality was assessed using the Downs and Black tool. RESULTS Four studies in abdominal surgery (3 randomized controlled trials [RCTs] and 1 observational prospective study) and 4 studies in thoracic surgery (3 RCTs and 1 observational retrospective study) were identified.

We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) of patients with right upper limb idiopathic focal dystonia and paired controls during resting state, writing-from-memory, and finger-tapping tasks. We applied power spectrum analyses considering the mu, beta and gamma rhythms of the motor cortex and analyzed brain connectivity networks and microstates.

This review systematically examines the effects of bariatric surgery on drug pharmacokinetics, focusing especially on the mechanisms involved in restricting oral bioavailability. Studies with a longitudinal before-after design investigating the pharmacokinetics of at least one drug were reviewed. The need for dose adjustment following bariatric surgery was examined, as well as the potential for extrapolation to other drugs subjected to coinciding pharmacokinetic mechanisms. A total of 22 original articles and 32 different drugs were assessed. The majority of available data is based on Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) (18 of 22 studies), and hence, the overall interpretation is more or less limited to RYGBP. In the case of the majority of studied drugs, an increased absorption rate was observed early after RYGBP. The effect on systemic exposure allows for a low degree of extrapolation, including between drugs subjected to the same major metabolic and transporter pathways. On the basis of current understanding, predicting the pharmacokinetic change for a specific drug following RYGBP is challenging. Close monitoring of each individual drug is therefore recommended in the early postsurgical phase. Future studies should focus on the long-term effects of bariatric surgery on drug disposition, and they should also aim to disentangle the effects of the surgery itself and the subsequent weight loss.","Angeles, Philip Carlo; Robertsen, Ida; Seeberg, Lars Thomas; Krogstad, Veronica; Skattebu, Julie; Sandbu, Rune; Åsberg, Anders; Hjelmesaeth, Jøran",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,565,11

OBJECTIVES To determine the impact of continuous control of tracheal cuff pressure (P(cuff)) on microaspiration of gastric contents. METHODS Prospective randomized controlled trial performed in a single medical intensive care unit. A total of 122 patients expected to receive mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours through a tracheal tube were randomized to receive continuous control of P(cuff) using a pneumatic device (intervention group, n = 61) or routine care of P(cuff) (control group, n = 61). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The primary outcome was microaspiration of gastric contents as defined by the presence of pepsin at a significant level in tracheal secretions collected during the 48 hours after randomization. Secondary outcomes included incidence of VAP, tracheobronchial bacterial concentration, and tracheal ischemic lesions. The pneumatic device was efficient in controlling P(cuff). Pepsin was measured in 1,205 tracheal aspirates. Percentage of patients with abundant microaspiration (18 vs. 46%; P = 0.002; OR [95% confidence interval], 0.25 [0.11-0.59]), bacterial concentration in tracheal aspirates (mean ± SD 1.6 ± 2.4 vs. 3.1 ± 3.7 log(10) cfu/ml, P = 0.014), and VAP rate (9.8 vs. 26.2%; P = 0.032; 0.30 [0.11-0.84]) were significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the control group. However, no significant difference was found in tracheal ischemia score between the two groups.

They advocate the use of clinically validated risk scores in conjunction with biochemical and imaging results. Patients with mild disease can now be managed in the outpatient setting and with newly developed therapies, such as catheter-directed thrombolysis, becoming available in more centres, treatment options for those with more severe disease are also expanding. This article presents four theoretical but realistic cases, each diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism, but differing in levels of severity. These demonstrate how the guidelines can be applied in a clinical setting, with particular focus on risk stratification and management.","Stevenson, Alexander; Davis, Sarah; Murch, Nick",British journal of hospital medicine,565,1

Herein, we seek factors that affect the CAS-CEA treatment differences and potentially to identify a subgroup of patients for whom CAS and CEA have equivalent periprocedural S+D risk. METHODS Patient and arterial characteristics were assessed as effect modifiers of the CAS-CEA treatment difference in 2502 patients by the addition of factor-by-treatment interaction terms to a logistic regression model. RESULTS Lesion length and lesions that were contiguous or were sequential and noncontiguous extending remote from the bulb were identified as influencing the CAS-to-CEA S+D treatment difference. For those with longer lesion length (≥12.85 mm), the risk of CAS was higher than that of CEA (odds ratio [OR], 3.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-9.78). Among patients with sequential or remote lesions extending beyond the bulb, the risk for S+D was higher for CAS relative to CEA (OR, 9.01; 95% CI, 1.20-67.8). For the 37% of patients with lesions that were both short and contiguous, the odds of S+D in those treated with CAS was nonsignificantly 28% lower than for CEA (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.21-2.46). CONCLUSIONS The higher S+D risk for those treated with CAS appears to be largely isolated to those with longer lesion length and/or those with sequential and remote lesions. In the absence of those lesion characteristics, CAS appears to be as safe as CEA with regard to periprocedural risk of S+D.","Moore, Wesley S; Popma, Jeffrey J; Roubin, Gary S; Voeks, Jenifer H; Cutlip, Donald E; Jones, Michael; Howard, George; Brott, Thomas G",Journal of vascular surgery,565,1

Second, the article will focus on current green health care initiatives in the United States in which patients and physicians participate. Third, the rationale for participation in green initiatives will be explained. Fourth, the article will propose that, based on the environmental values of patients and physicians, health care insurance plans and health care insurance companies can be targeted for green health care reform, thereby closing the loop of sustainable health care delivery.","Richie, Cristina","The Journal of law, medicine & ethics : a journal of the American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics",565,19

Unfortunately a significant group of patients fail to respond. Therapeutic drug monitoring might help to maintain or induce remission by providing a tool for optimization of 5-ASA therapy. However, plasma and urine concentrations of 5-ASA reflect systemic uptake and are not useful to evaluate therapeutic effect. OBJECTIVES To explore if mucosal and faecal 5-ASA values correlate with disease activity and/or therapeutic effects in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, especially UC. METHOD We identified studies that analysed 5-ASA in faeces or mucosa of humans using an oral 5-ASA formulation, using PubMed and Embase. RESULTS In total, 39 studies (n = 939) were included, 27 on faecal 5-ASA, 9 on mucosal concentrations, and 3 on both faecal and mucosal values. We included 33 cross-sectional studies, 3 randomised clinical trials, 2 longitudinal cohorts and 1 randomized cross-over study. Mucosal 5-ASA concentrations in healthy subjects and patients on equivalent doses of 5-ASA were not found to differ remarkably. In the sub-analysis of mucosal 5-ASA concentrations in patients with active or quiescent UC, a higher concentration was seen during remission. Faecal concentrations were associated with 5-ASA doses but not with disease activity. Differences in faecal or mucosal 5-ASA values could not be ascribed to different 5-ASA formulations. CONCLUSIONS An increase of the mucosal 5-ASA concentrations was observed during remission in patients with UC. No clear relationship between the faecal 5-ASA excretion and the therapeutic efficacy was identified.","van de Meeberg, Maartje M; Schultheiss, Johannes P D; Oldenburg, Bas; Fidder, Herma H; Huitema, Alwin D R",Digestion,565,8

Here, we present a low-cost, rapid, reliable, and integrable anion-exchange membrane-(AEM) based multiplexed sensing platform for this application. Unlike the gold-standard manual ELISA test, incubation/wash steps are optimized for each target and precisely metered in microfluidic chips to enhance selectivity. Unlike optical detection and unreliable visual detection for the ELISA test, which require standardization for every usage, the AEM ion current signal also offers robustness, endowed by the pH and ionic strength control capability of the ion-selective membrane, such that a universal standard curve can be used to calibrate all runs. The electrical signal is enhanced by highly charged silica nanoparticle reporters, which also act as hydrodynamic shear amplifiers to enhance selectivity during wash. This AEM-based sensing platform is tested with vascular protein biomarkers, Endothelin-1 (ET-1), Angiogenin (ANG) and Placental Growth Factor (PlGF). The limit of detection and three-decade dynamic range are comparable to ELISA assay but with a significantly reduced assay time of 1 h vs 7 h, due to the elimination of calibration and blocking steps. Optimized protocol for each target renders the detection highly reliable with more than 98% confidence. The multiplexed detection capability of the platform is also demonstrated by simultaneous detection of ET-1, ANG and PlGF in 40 μl of the vascular endothelial cell culture supernatants using three-membrane AEM sensor and the performance is validated against ELISA.","Ramshani, Zeinab; Fan, Fei; Wei, Alicia; Romanello-Giroud-Joaquim, Miguel; Gil, Chang-Hyun; George, Matt; Yoder, Mervin C; Hanjaya-Putra, Donny; Senapati, Satyajyoti; Chang, Hsueh-Chia",Talanta,565,1

A protocol for a systematic review of economic evaluation.,19.073427,7.628999,2020,"BACKGROUND It has been reported that boys' and girls' physical activity (PA) levels decline throughout adolescence. Boys are at risk of physical inactivity during adolescence; however, in intervention research, they are an under-represented group relative to girls. It is suggested that the school environment may be central to developing interventions that support adolescents in meeting the current PA guidelines. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the efficacy of school-based physical activity interventions for improving muscular fitness (MF) in adolescent males. METHODS This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the preferred reporting systems for meta-analyses guidelines and was registered on PROSPERO (Registration number: CRD42018091023). Eligible studies were published in English within peer-reviewed articles. Searches were conducted in three databases, with an additional grey literature search in Google Scholar. Studies investigating MF outcomes were included. RESULTS There were 43 data sets identified across 11 studies, from seven countries. Overall methodological quality of the studies was moderate-to-strong. Interventions targeting MF evidenced a small-to-medium effect (g = 0.32, CI 0.17, 0.48, p < 0.00). Subgroup analyses of MF delivery method resulted in small-to-medium effects: upper limb MF measures (g = 0.28, 95% CI - 0.02, 0.58, p = 0.07), lower limb MF measures (g = 0.28, 95% CI 0.09, 0.68, p = 0.03), combined MF activities (g = 0.24, 95% CI - 0.04 to 0.49, p = 0.05), plyometric activities (g = 0.39, 95% CI 0.09, 0.68, p = 0.01), body weight (g = 0.27, 95% CI - 0.10, 0.65, p = 0.15), and traditional MF methods (g = 0.43, 95% CI 0.09, 0.78, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS School-based interventions which aimed to increase MF outcomes in adolescent boys demonstrated small-to-moderate effects. Traditional and plyometric methods of resistance training appear to be the most effective form of PA delivery in adolescent males. More quality research is required to assess the impact of MF delivered in the school environment to inform future intervention design.","Cox, Ashley; Fairclough, Stuart J; Kosteli, Maria-Christina; Noonan, Robert J",Sports medicine,565,9

This scale was used in several clinical studies in patients with varying severity of the course of the COVID 19. SHOKS-COVID scale was also compared against some additional biomarkers and with length of hospital stay.Results In patients with severe COVID-19 (Clinical Trial WAYFARER - 34 patients), SHOKS-COVID scores were correlated with the degree of inflammation: CRP (r = 0.64; p <0.0001); the ratio lymphocytes / CRP (r = - 0.64; p <0.0001). Also, SHOKS-COVID score correlated with the D-dimer (r = 0.35; p <0.0001) and percentage lung damage on multispiral computed tomography (MSCT) - (r = 0.77, p < 0.0001) and length stay in the clinic (r = 0.57, p = 0.0009). In patients with mild course (BISQUIT Study - 103 patients), SHOKS-COVID scores had a statistically significant positive correlation with length of fever (r = 0.37; p = 0.0002) and length of stay in the clinic (r = 0.52, p <0.0001) and negatively correlated with the ratio of lymphocytes / CRP (-0.78, p <0.0001) and the level of CRP (r=0.78; p <0.0001). Patents were grouped based on severity of COVID 19 and median and interquartile range (IQR) of SHOCKS-COVID were measured in these groups. Median and IQR of SHOCKS-COVID were 2.00 [1.0-2.5] points in mild course, 4.0 points [3.0-5.0] in moderate course, 7.0 points [6.0-9.0] in moderately severe course,12.0 points [10.0-14.0] in severe course of disease and 15.0 points [14.5-15.5] in extremely severe patients.Conclusion Here we report a novel scale of COVID 19 disease progression. This scale ranges from zero in asymptomatic patients (with normal range of biomarkers and without lung damage on CT) to fifteen in extremely severe patients. The scores for SHOKS-COVID are increasing, in parallel with the deterioration of all other biomarkers of severity and prognosis in patients with new coronavirus infection. Based on the analysis carried out, we were able to determine values of SHOKS-COVID scale and levels of main clinical and laboratory markers in patients with different severity of COVID 19.","Mareev, V Yu; Begrambekova, Yu L; Mareev, Yu V",Kardiologiia,565,12

People who are culturally distinct from the dominant population group may experience a variety of barriers to accessing healthcare, including linguistic and cultural barriers in communication, navigation of an unfamiliar health system and unconscious or overt discrimination. Here, we outline the protocol of a scoping review to identify, describe and summarise interventions aimed at improving access to eye care for non-Indigenous, non-dominant ethnic groups residing in high-income countries. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search MEDLINE, Embase and Global Health from their inception to July 2019. We will include studies of any design that describe an intervention to promote access to eye care for non-Indigenous, non-dominant ethnic groups. Two authors will independently review titles, abstracts and full-text articles for inclusion. Reference lists from all included articles will also be searched. In cases of disagreement between initial reviewers, a third author will help resolve the conflict. For each included article, we will extract data about the target population, details of the intervention delivered and the effectiveness of or feedback from the intervention. Overall findings will be summarised with descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This review will summarise existing literature and as such ethics approval is not required. We will publish the review in an open-access, peer-reviewed journal, and draft appropriate summaries for dissemination to the wider community. This wider community could include clinicians, policymakers, health service managers and organisations that work with non-dominant ethnic groups.

However, it is difficult to use high-resolution sensors and cameras for occupancy prediction due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for predicting occupancy using multiple low-cost and low-resolution heat sensors. We suggest two different methods for fusing and processing the data captured from multiple heat sensors and we use a Convolutional Neural Network for predicting occupancy. We conduct experiments to assess both the performance of the proposed solutions and analyze the impact of sensor field view overlaps on the prediction results.

The current literature presented different measurement methods and reported the results of utilisation of new technologies for measuring COVE. However, previous papers used different technology applications covering only a part of the monitoring process with its own limitations. Since technologies are advancing and offering novel solutions, there is an urgent need to identify the gaps, re-evaluate the current methods, and develop a critical agenda for automating the entire process of collecting emissions data from construction sites, and monitoring the emission contributors across cities. This paper systematically identifies relevant papers through a search of three key databases-Web of Science, Engineering Valley and Scopus-covering the publications in the last decade from 2008 to 2017. An innovative robust research method was designed to select and analyse the relevant papers. The identified papers were stored in a data set, and a thematic algorithm employed to find the clusters of papers which might be potentially relevant. The selected papers were used for further micro-thematic analysis to find key relevant papers on COVE, and the gap in the literature. A sample of relevant papers was found relevant to COVE and critically reviewed by coding and content analysis. This paper critically reviews the selected papers and also shows that there is a considerable gap in the applications of new technologies for measuring in-use COVE in real time based on real activities toward automated methods. This review enables practitioners and scholars to gain a concrete understanding of the gap in measuring COVE and to provide a significant agenda for future technology applications.","Sepasgozar, Samad M E; Li, Heng; Shirowzhan, Sara; Tam, Vivian W Y",Environmental science and pollution research international,565,1

Herein, the 3CLpro from the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, an enteropathogenic CoV, was used as a model to identify novel crucial residues for enzyme activity. First, we established a rapid, sensitive, and efficient luciferase-based biosensor to monitor the activity of PDEV 3CLpro in vivo. Using this luciferase biosensor, along with confirming the well-known catalytic residues (His41 and Cys144), we identified 4 novel proteolytically inactivated mutants of PDEV 3CLpro, which was also confirmed in mammalian cells by biochemical experiments. Our molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that the hydrogen bonding interactions occurring within and outside of the protease's active site and the dynamic fluctuations of the substrate, especially the van der Waals contacts, were drastically altered, a situation related to the loss of 3CLpro activity. These data suggest that changing the intermolecular dynamics in protein-substrate complexes eliminates the mechanism underlying the protease activity. The discovery of novel crucial residues for enzyme activity in the binding pocket could potentially provide more druggable sites for the design of protease inhibitors. In addition, our in-depth study of the dynamic substrate's envelope model using MD simulations is an approach that could augment the discovery of new inhibitors against 3CLpro in CoVs and other viral 3C proteases.-Zhou, J., Fang, L., Yang, Z., Xu, S., Lv, M., Sun, Z., Chen, J., Wang, D., Gao, J., Xiao, S.

The second stage of segmentation is breast lesion detection that consists of 32-class Otsu thresholding and Markov random field techniques. Histogram, gray level co-occurrence matrix and neighboring gray tone difference matrix based feature extraction, Fisher score based feature selection and, tenfold and leave-one-out cross-validation steps are carried out after segmentation to increase the reliability of the designed system while decreasing the computational time.

High-quality human data in prospective studies are scarce. METHODS We used the ability to visualize intraperitoneal PVDF meshes enhanced with iron particles (DynaMesh IPOM visible) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine the amount of shrinkage between 1 and 13 months postoperatively. All measurements of the width, length, and surface area of the mesh were performed with a standardized methodology independently by four radiologists blinded for the timing of the MRI. RESULTS Of the 15 patients undergoing laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, 13 patients received an MRI both at 1 and at 13 months. Evaluation of inter-rater reliability between the radiologists showed intra-class correlations of 0.95 (95% CI 0.92-0.98) for the width, 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.98) for the length, and 0.99 (90% CI 0.99-1.00) for the surface area of the mesh. The change between measurement at implantation and 1-month MRI was - 0.7 cm (P = 0.023; - 3.6%) for the width and - 1.9 cm (P = 0.001; - 7.2%) for the length. The change between 1 and 13 months was - 0.06 cm (P = 0.74; shrinkage = 0.3%) for the width, - 0.12 cm (P = 0.56; shrinkage = 0.5%) for the length, and - 4.0 cm2 (P = 0.20; shrinkage = 1.0%) for the surface area of the mesh. CONCLUSION There is excellent inter-rater reliability between radiologists when measuring width, length, and surface area of visible intraperitoneal PVDF mesh with MRI.

Respiratory decline in patients with COVID-19 is precipitated by a lung-mediated aberrant immune cytokine storm. Low-dose lung radiation was used to treat pneumonia in the pre-antibiotic era. Radiation immunomodulatory effects may improve outcomes for select patients with COVID-19. METHODS A single-institution trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of single-fraction, low-dose whole-lung radiation for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is being performed for the first time. This report describes outcomes of a planned day 7 interim analysis. Eligible patients were hospitalized, had radiographic consolidation, required supplemental oxygen, and were clinically deteriorating. RESULTS Of 9 patients screened, 5 were treated with whole-lung radiation on April 24 until April 28 2020, and they were followed for a minimum of 7 days. The median age was 90 years (range, 64-94 years), and 4 were nursing home residents with multiple comorbidities. Within 24 hours of radiation, 3 patients (60%) were weaned from supplemental oxygen to ambient air, 4 (80%) exhibited radiographic improvement, and the median Glasgow Coma Scale score improved from 10 to 14. A fourth patient (80% overall recovery) was weaned from oxygen at hour 96. The mean time to clinical recovery was 35 hours. There were no acute toxicities. CONCLUSIONS In a pilot trial of 5 oxygen-dependent elderly patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, low-dose whole-lung radiation led to rapid improvements in clinical status, encephalopathy, and radiographic consolidation without acute toxicity. Low-dose whole-lung radiation appears to be safe, shows early promise of efficacy, and warrants further study. LAY SUMMARY Researchers at Emory University report preliminary safety outcomes for patients treated with low-dose lung irradiation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Five residents of nursing or group homes were hospitalized after testing positive for COVID-19. Each had pneumonia visible on a chest x-ray, required supplemental oxygen, and experienced a clinical decline in mental status or in work of breathing or a prolonged or escalating supplemental oxygen requirement. A single treatment of low-dose (1.5-Gy) radiation to both lungs was delivered over the course of 10 to 15 minutes. There was no acute toxicity attributable to radiation therapy. Within 24 hours, 4 patients had rapidly improved breathing, and they recovered to room air at an average of 1.5 days (range, 3-96 hours). Three were discharged at a mean time of 12 days, and 1 was preparing for discharge. Blood tests and repeat imaging confirm that low-dose whole-lung radiation treatment appears safe for COVID-19 pneumonia. Further trials are warranted.","Hess, Clayton B; Buchwald, Zachary S; Stokes, William; Nasti, Tahseen H; Switchenko, Jeffrey M; Weinberg, Brent D; Steinberg, James P; Godette, Karen D; Murphy, David; Ahmed, Rafi; Curran, Walter J; Khan, Mohammad K",Cancer,565,4

Here we report that astrocytes also play a role in cortical neurons' vulnerability to Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) infection through the release of extracellular ATP. We found that the interaction of HSV-1 with heparan sulfate proteoglycans expressed on the plasma membrane of astrocytes triggered phospholipase C-mediated IP3 -dependent intracellular Ca2+ transients causing extracellular release of ATP. ATP binds membrane purinergic P2 receptors (P2Rs) of both neurons and astrocytes causing an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration that activates the Glycogen Synthase Kinase (GSK)-3β, whose action is necessary for HSV-1 entry/replication in these cells. Indeed, in co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes HSV-1-infected neurons were only found in proximity of infected astrocytes releasing ATP, whereas in the presence of fluorocitrate, an inhibitor of astrocyte metabolism, switching-off the HSV-1-induced ATP release, very few neurons were infected. The addition of exogenous ATP, mimicking that released by astrocytes after HSV-1 challenge, restored the ability of HSV-1 to infect neurons co-cultured with metabolically-inhibited astrocytes. The ATP-activated, P2R-mediated, and GSK-3-dependent molecular pathway underlying HSV-1 infection is likely shared by neurons and astrocytes, given that the blockade of either P2Rs or GSK-3 activation inhibited infection of both cell types. These results add a new layer of information to our understanding of the critical role played by astrocytes in regulating neuronal functions and their response to noxious stimuli including microbial agents via Ca2+ -dependent release of neuroactive molecules.","Li Puma, Domenica Donatella; Marcocci, Maria Elena; Lazzarino, Giacomo; De Chiara, Giovanna; Tavazzi, Barbara; Palamara, Anna Teresa; Piacentini, Roberto; Grassi, Claudio",Glia,565,31

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to determine the usage of HIV self-testing (HIVST) kits and their secondary distribution to partners among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China, who use PrEP, in an observational study between 2018 and 2019. METHODS In 4 major cities in China, we prospectively followed-up MSM from the China Real-world oral PrEP demonstration study, which provides daily or on-demand PrEP for 12 months, to assess the usage and secondary distribution of HIVST on quarterly follow-ups. Half of the PrEP users were randomized to receive 2 HIVSTs per month in addition to quarterly facility-based HIV testing. We evaluated the feasibility of providing HIVST to PrEP users. RESULTS We recruited 939 MSM and randomized 471 to receive HIVST, among whom 235 (49.9%) were daily and 236 (50.1%) were on-demand PrEP users. At baseline, the median age was 29 years, 390 (82.0%) men had at least college-level education, and 119 (25.3%) had never undergone facility-based HIV testing before. Three months after PrEP initiation, 341 (74.5%) men had used the HIVST provided to them and found it very easy to use. Among them, 180 of 341 (52.8%) men had distributed the HIVST kits it to other MSM, and 132 (51.6%) among the 256 men who returned HIVST results reported that used it with their sexual partners at the onset of intercourse. Participants on daily PrEP were more likely to use HIVST (adjusted hazard ratio=1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.6) and distribute HIVST kits (adjusted hazard ratio=1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.7) than those using on-demand PrEP. CONCLUSIONS MSM who used PrEP had a high rate of usage and secondary distribution of HIVST kits, especially among those on daily PrEP, which suggested high feasibility and necessity for HIVST after PrEP initiation. Assuming that fourth-generation HIVST kits are available, HIVST may be able to replace facility-based HIV testing to a certain extent.

METHOD This was a prospective, open-label, 4-week randomized controlled trial. The primary end points of the study were changes in signs associated with critical colonization and in wound surface areas. All subjects were evaluated at weeks 0, 2, and 4 at the end of the study. SUBJECT AND SETTINGS: Participants between 18 and 85 years of age were recruited from 2 wound care clinics in Canada. The study was reviewed and approved by research ethics boards. DATA ANALYSIS Analyses of this study were carried out based on intent-to-treat principle; t tests were used to determine if the means were statistically different between treatment groups. RESULTS Thirty-four subjects participated and completed in the study. In the control group, the mean infection checklist score was 2.2 at baseline and 2.3 at week 4 (t9 = -0.36, P = .73). In the silver alginate powder group, the infection score reduced from 3.3 at baseline to 1.3 at week 4; the result was significant (t23 = 7.62, P < .00). The difference in average surface reduction over time between the 2 groups was statistically significant (t32 = 3.56, P < .001). Subjects randomized to the silver group achieved a greater surface reduction than those who were randomized to the use of foam dressing as the control. CONCLUSION Silver alginate powder is an effective treatment option for wounds with increased bacterial burden.","Woo, Kevin Y; Coutts, Patricia M; Sibbald, R Gary",Advances in skin & wound care,565,12

A significant increase in the number of new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrates the urgency of finding drugs effective against this pathogen.The aim of this work was to evaluate the in vitro antiviral efficacy of human recombinant alpha-2b interferon (IFN-α2b) against SARS-CoV-2 virus. MATERIAL AND METHODS The experiments had been carried out on Vero Cl008, the continuous line of African green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus) kidney cells. The effectiveness of the drugs was assessed by the suppression of viral reproduction in vitro. The biological activity was determined using titration of a virus-containing suspension in a Vero Cl008 cell culture by the formation of negative colonies. RESULTS The antiviral efficacy of the IFN-α2b-based medications, which have a high safety profile and proven efficacy in the prevention and treatment of influenza and acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI), has been studied against the new pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro experiments in Vero C1008 cell culture. IFN-α2b effectively inhibits the reproduction of the virus when applied both 24 hrs before and 2 hrs after infection. In the IFN-α2b concentration range 102-106 IU/ml a complete suppression of the reproduction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus had been demonstrated. DISCUSSION IFN-α2b demonstrated in vitro high antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the substance has a high chemotherapeutic index (>1000). CONCLUSION Medications for intranasal use based on IFN-α2b have high antiviral activity and are promising drugs for in vivo study in terms of prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Loginova, S Ya; Shсhukina, V N; Savenko, S V; Borisevich, S V",Voprosy virusologii,565,27

A study was performed to investigate the association between positive viral detection and respiratory infection in an at-risk population. METHODS 299 adult patients who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) procedures were enrolled in a hospital-based prospective cohort study. Descriptive epidemiology is presented of 17 different respiratory viruses detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays in BAL fluid specimens. Multivariate analysis was conducted to identify the clinical characteristics independently associated with the presence of virus. RESULTS Of 522 BAL fluid specimens analysed, 81% were collected in adult transplant recipients or other immunocompromised patients. Overall, PCR assays identified viral nucleic acid in 91 BAL fluid samples (17.4%). Similar rates of virus-positive BAL fluid were found in the different subpopulations studied (p = 0.113). Coronaviruses were the most frequent (32.3%), followed by rhinovirus (22.6%), parainfluenza (19.5%), influenza (9.7%), respiratory synctial virus (8.6%), human metapneumovirus (4.2%) and bocavirus (3.1%). Multivariate analysis using mixed models showed that respiratory viral infections were associated with a lack of antibiotic treatment response (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.1) and the absence of radiological infiltrate (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.8). In lung transplant recipients in whom a respiratory infection was suspected, the respiratory viral detection rate was 24.4% compared with 13.8% overall in other patients (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS In this cohort of hospitalised adults, respiratory viruses detected in BAL fluid specimens were associated with respiratory symptoms, absence of radiological infiltrates and a poor response to antibiotic therapy.","Garbino, J; Soccal, P M; Aubert, J-D; Rochat, T; Meylan, P; Thomas, Y; Tapparel, C; Bridevaux, P-O; Kaiser, L",Thorax,565,31

We investigated whether mental imagery of the 9/11 terrorist attacks following media exposure is dampened by taxing working memory (WM). METHODS Forty-five young adult UK residents, who were exposed to the 9/11 terrorist attacks as children via the media, identified a personally-relevant mental image of the attacks. They were then randomly allocated to: (1) recall + Tetris, (2) recall + eye movements (EMs), or (3) recall-only. Ratings on imagery vividness and emotionality were provided at three time points: pre-, post-manipulations, and at 24-hr follow-up. RESULTS Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that recall + Tetris and recall + EMs (relative to recall-only) significantly reduced imagery vividness and emotionality from pre- to post-manipulations, but not to follow-up. LIMITATIONS A passive control group is needed to fully rule out the role of natural memory decay; the follow-up was exploratory and took place outside the laboratory with reduced experimental control. CONCLUSIONS Aversive memory imagery from media trauma in civilians can be dampened by taxing WM, at least temporarily, which could be therapeutically useful.

A young man presented after a recent viral illness. He was in severe cardiogenic shock and was implanted with an emergency biventricular assist device, which also incorporated an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator.

Cervical ultrasound is commonly used to localize parathyroid adenomas, but can lead to discovery of concomitant thyroid gland pathology requiring modification of the operative approach. How the identification of incidental thyroid lesions affects patient management is unclear. STUDY DESIGN A prospective database of patients undergoing parathyroidectomy was analyzed for thyroid pathology discovered by ultrasound. Lesions were biopsied if indicated, and operative management was adjusted accordingly. Clinical data were correlated with operative decision-making. RESULTS Between July 2002 and November 2009, 310 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism underwent ultrasound. Concomitant thyroid pathology was noted in 89 (29%) patients. Thirty-seven patients (42% of pathology) underwent fine-needle aspiration of a thyroid nodule. Thirteen patients (4% of all patients) underwent a thyroid operation not related to parathyroid disease: 9 thyroid lobectomies for presumably benign nodules and 4 total thyroidectomies for malignancy. Two were for confirmed papillary thyroid cancer, and the other 2 were for an indeterminate biopsy that later proved to be papillary thyroid cancer. One lobectomy discovered microscopic papillary thyroid cancer independent of the biopsied nodule. In total, 5 (2% of all patients) malignancies were discovered. CONCLUSIONS Twenty-nine percent of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism had concomitant thyroid pathology on ultrasound. Forty-two percent of these patients underwent biopsy, and 2% had malignant pathology. Routine use of ultrasound in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism leads to discovery of unrecognized thyroid pathology and cancer.","Adler, Joel T; Chen, Herbert; Schaefer, Sarah; Sippel, Rebecca S",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,565,16

Most are managed without endoscopic evaluation because the risk of practitioner infection outweighs the value of biopsy analysis unless symptoms are life-threatening. As a result, much of what is known about the gastrointestinal manifestations of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been gleaned from surgical and autopsy cases that suffer from extensive ischemic injury and/or poor preservation. There are no detailed reports describing any other gastrointestinal effects of SARS-CoV-2 even though >3,000,000 people have died from COVID-19 worldwide. The purpose of this study is to report the intestinal findings related to SARS-CoV-2 infection by way of a small case series including one with evidence of direct viral cytopathic effect and 2 with secondary injury attributed to viral infection. Infection can be confirmed by immunohistochemical stains directed against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in situ hybridization for spike protein-encoding RNA, and ultrastructural visualization of viruses within the epithelium. It induces cytoplasmic blebs and tufted epithelial cells without inflammation and may not cause symptoms. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause gastrointestinal symptoms after the virus is no longer detected, reflecting systemic activation of cytokine and complement cascades rather than direct viral injury. Reversible mucosal ischemia features microvascular injury with hemorrhage, small vessel thrombosis, and platelet-rich thrombi. Systemic cytokine elaboration and dysbiosis likely explain epithelial cell injury that accompanies diarrheal symptoms. These observations are consistent with clinical and in vitro data and contribute to our understanding of the protean manifestations of COVID-19.","Yantiss, Rhonda K; Qin, LiHui; He, Bing; Crawford, Carl V; Seshan, Surya; Patel, Sanjay; Wahid, Nabeel; Jessurun, Jose",The American journal of surgical pathology,565,1

METHODS Medical records of cats that underwent LA for unilateral functional adrenal tumors at 3 veterinary teaching hospitals were reviewed. Data collected included signalment, clinical signs, physical examination findings, diagnostic imaging results, preoperative laboratory tests, laparoscopic port placement and techniques, duration of anesthesia and surgery, complications, concomitant procedures, need for conversion to an open celiotomy, histopathological diagnosis, and postoperative survival. RESULTS Eleven cats were included, 5 with right-sided and 6 with left-sided tumors. Tumors were aldosterone-secreting (n = 8), progesterone-secreting (n = 2), or testosterone-secreting (n = 1). Adrenalectomy was successfully performed in all 11 cats although 4 cases required conversion to an open celiotomy, due to poor visualization (n = 2), close adherence of the tumor to the caudal vena cava (n = 1), and inability to maintain adequate pneumoperitoneum (n = 1). Ten of the 11 cats were discharged from the hospital, with a median survival time of 803 days (range 467-1123 days). One cat died from severe pancreatitis and cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

Individuals vary in dysmenorrhea pain severity, the number of painful sites, and co-occurring gastrointestinal symptoms. Three dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes were previously identified using latent class analysis; however, there is a need to validate these in an independent sample, so they can be used in mechanistic and interventional research. There also is a need to further characterize dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes in terms of demographic, clinical, and psychobehavioral characteristics so they can be used to inform precision dysmenorrhea treatment. OBJECTIVES The study objectives were to: (a) determine whether the same dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes would be found in a new sample; (b) determine whether including demographic, clinical, and psychobehavioral covariates in latent class analyses would change individuals' phenotype memberships; and (c) investigate relationships between dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes and demographic, clinical, and psychobehavioral characteristics. METHODS This cross-sectional survey study included 678 women (aged 14 to 42 years) with dysmenorrhea. Participants reported dysmenorrhea symptom severity, demographic, clinical (comorbid chronic pain and gynecological conditions), and psychobehavioral characteristics (perceived stress, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and pain catastrophizing). We used latent class analysis to identify symptom-based phenotypes. We compared analyses with and without covariates (i.e., demographic, clinical, and psychobehavioral characteristics) to determine if individuals' phenotype memberships changed. We then examined associations between phenotypes and demographic, clinical, and psychobehavioral characteristics. RESULTS We reproduced three dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes: the ""mild localized pain"" phenotype (characterized by mild abdominal cramps), the ""severe localized pain"" phenotype (characterized by severe abdominal cramps), and the ""multiple severe symptoms"" phenotype (characterized by severe pain at multiple locations and gastrointestinal symptoms). Analyses with and without covariates had little effect on individuals' phenotype membership. Race, comorbid chronic pain condition, endometriosis, and pain catastrophizing were significantly associated with the dysmenorrhea phenotypes. DISCUSSION Findings provide a foundation to further study mechanisms of dysmenorrhea symptom heterogeneity and develop dysmenorrhea precision treatments. The three dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes were validated in a second sample. Demographic, clinical, and psychobehavioral factors were associated with dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes.","Chen, Chen X; Carpenter, Janet S; Ofner, Susan; LaPradd, Michelle; Fortenberry, J Dennis",Nursing research,565,27

This will require active surveillance efforts in which these undetected cases are proactively sought out rather than waiting for individuals to present to testing sites for diagnosis. However, finding these pockets of asymptomatic cases (i.e., hotspots) is akin to searching for needles in a haystack as choosing where and when to test within communities is hampered by a lack of epidemiological information to guide decision makers' allocation of these resources. Making sequential decisions with partial information is a classic problem in decision science, the explore v. exploit dilemma. Using methods-bandit algorithms-similar to those used to search for other kinds of lost or hidden objects, from downed aircraft or underground oil deposits, we can address the explore v. exploit tradeoff facing active surveillance efforts and optimize the deployment of mobile testing resources to maximize the yield of new SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses. These bandit algorithms can be implemented easily as a guide to active case finding for SARS-CoV-2. A simple Thompson sampling algorithm and an extension of it to integrate spatial correlation in the data are now embedded in a fully functional prototype of a web app to allow policymakers to use either of these algorithms to target SARS-CoV-2 testing. In this instance, potential testing locations were identified by using mobility data from UberMedia to target high-frequency venues in Columbus, Ohio, as part of a planned feasibility study of the algorithms in the field. However, it is easily adaptable to other jurisdictions, requiring only a set of candidate test locations with point-to-point distances between all locations, whether or not mobility data are integrated into decision making in choosing places to test.","Gonsalves, Gregg S; Copple, J Tyler; Paltiel, A David; Fenichel, Eli P; Bayham, Jude; Abraham, Mark; Kline, David; Malloy, Sam; Rayo, Michael F; Zhang, Net; Faulkner, Daria; Morey, Dane A; Wu, Frank; Thornhill, Thomas; Iloglu, Suzan; Warren, Joshua L",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,565,1

The COVID-19 pandemic and associated response can have a significant downstream effect on access to routine health care services, and indirectly cause morbidity and mortality from causes other than the disease itself, especially in resource-poor countries such as Ethiopia. This study aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on these services and measures taken to combat the effect. METHODS The study was conducted at St. Paul's hospital millennium medical college (SPHMMC) from December 15, 2020 to January 15, 2021 using a comparative cross-sectional study design. We collected data on the number of clients getting different essential health care services from May to October 2019 (Pre COVID) and the same period in 2020 (during a COVID-19 pandemic) from the patient registry book. The analysis was done with SPSS version 24 software. RESULT Overall, the essential services of SPHMMC were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The most affected service is inpatient admission, which showed a 73.3% (2044 to 682) reduction from the pre-COVID period and the least affected is maternal service, which only decreased by 13% (3671 to 3177). During the 6 months after the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a progressive increment in the number of clients getting essential health services.

Their burden and genetic diversity vary from one region to another and little is known in Northern African regions. This study describes epidemiological patterns and genotypic diversity of HRV in SARI cases during a two and half year's study, in Northern Tunisia. METHODOLOGY A total of 271 SARI cases, admitted into the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of Bechir Hamza Children's Hospital in Tunis, were collected between September 2015 and December 2017. The investigation concerned 104 samples positive for HRV and/or HEV (Human Enterovirus) obtained among these cases. Specific HRV and HEV detections were assessed by real-time PCRs. The HRV molecular typing was based on the VP4-VP2 genomic region analyses. RESULTS Among the viral SARI cases, 33.5% and 12.3% were positive for HRV and HEV respectively. Molecular investigations showed high prevalence of HRV-A (63.3%) followed by HRV-C (30.6%) and HRV-B (6.1%) and high genotypic diversity with 27 types. HRV cases were mostly detected in toddlers younger than 6 months. A total of 16 cases (28%) were found with bacterial and/or viral co-infection. HRV-C infection and HRV-A with bacterial co-infection were associated with complicated infection. Some of the detected types showed a continuous circulation or turnover during an extended period. HRV-A101 and HRV-C45 were the most frequently detected types. CONCLUSIONS This study revealed, for the first time, the high HRV diversity in Tunisia, a North-African region.

While structural damage to corticospinal pathways in people with CP is known, its impact on the activation of these pathways is not. OBJECTIVE To provide the first, complete activation profile of corticospinal pathways in adults with CP using a full range of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) intensities and voluntary contractions. METHODS TMS targeted the soleus muscle of 16 adults with bilateral spastic CP and 15 neurologically intact (NI) control participants. Activation profiles were generated using motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) produced by varying both stimulation intensity and degree of voluntary muscle activity. Anatomical integrity of corticospinal pathways was also measured with diffusion tractography. RESULTS Participants with CP had smaller MEPs produced by TMS at 1.2× active motor threshold during submaximal (20%) muscle activity and smaller maximal MEPs produced under any combination of stimulation intensity and voluntary muscle activity. At a fixed stimulation intensity, increasing voluntary muscle activity facilitated MEP amplitudes to a lesser degree in the participants with CP. Consistent differences in diffusion tractography suggested structural abnormalities in the corticospinal pathways of participants with CP that correlated with maximal MEPs. CONCLUSION People with bilateral spastic CP have impaired activation of low and high-threshold corticospinal pathways to soleus motoneurons by TMS and reduced facilitation by voluntary activity that may be associated with structural damage to these pathways. These impairments likely contribute to impaired voluntary movement.","Condliffe, Elizabeth G; Jeffery, Dean T; Emery, Derek J; Treit, Sarah; Beaulieu, Christian; Gorassini, Monica A",Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,565,27

Furthermore, limited data exist on pattern of ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) response-particularly in those prescribed aldosterone antagonists at the time of RDN. METHODS We examined all patients treated with RDN for treatment-resistant hypertension in 18 UK centres. RESULTS Results from 253 patients treated with five technologies are shown. Pre-procedural mean office BP (OBP) was 185/102 mmHg (SD 26/19; n = 253) and mean daytime ABP was 170/98 mmHg (SD 22/16; n = 186). Median number of antihypertensive drugs was 5.0: 96 % ACEi/ARB; 86 % thiazide/loop diuretic and 55 % aldosterone antagonist. OBP, available in 90 % at 11 months follow-up, was 163/93 mmHg (reduction of 22/9 mmHg). ABP, available in 70 % at 8.5 months follow-up, was 158/91 mmHg (fall of 12/7 mmHg). Mean drug changes post RDN were: 0.36 drugs added, 0.91 withdrawn. Dose changes appeared neutral.

The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the existing knowledge on this topic. METHODS MEDLINE and Web of Science were searched for studies investigating nuclear medicine imaging methods for the prediction of postoperative liver function in patients undergoing localized, liver-directed treatments. The postoperative endpoints were clinical outcome (morbidity and mortality) as well as measures of postoperative liver function, e.g., liver function assessed by biochemical tests or nuclear imaging. RESULTS A total of 1352 references were identified, of which 82 fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Most studies (n = 63) were retrospective studies. The vast majority of studies assessed [99mTc]Tc-galactosyl serum albumin (GSA) (n = 57) and [99mTc]Tc-mebrofenin (n = 19). Liver resection was entirely or partly major (involved at least three segments) in 78 reports. There were notable variations in the research methodology, e.g., image acquisition, imaging variables, and endpoints. Thirty-seven studies reported on postoperative mortality, of which most reported descriptive data at the patient level. Of the four reports that performed multivariate analyses, two showed significant predictive results of isotope-based preoperative tests. Fifty-two papers presented data on postoperative liver failure. Multivariate predictive analyses were performed in eighteen trials, of which fifteen showed the significant value of nuclear medicine tests. CONCLUSION There is sparse evidence supporting the significant value of nuclear medicine imaging methods in predicting postoperative mortality. In contrast, a notable number of trials showed a significant prediction of liver failure in multivariate analyses. The research methodology was heterogeneous and exploratory in most trials. Documentation of nuclear medicine tests in this setting awaits the results of properly designed, prospective trials with the standardization of both the nuclear medicine test and endpoints.","Espersen, Caroline; Borgwardt, Lise; Larsen, Peter Nørgaard; Andersen, Trine Borup; Stenholt, Louise; Petersen, Lars Jelstrup",EJNMMI research,565,19

We report the 10-year risk of definitive stoma after SSR for low rectal cancer. METHOD From 1994 to 2008, patients with low rectal cancer who were suitable for SSR were analysed retrospectively. Patients were divided into the following four groups: low colorectal anastomosis (LCRA); coloanal anastomosis (CAA); partial intersphincteric resection (pISR); and total intersphincteric resection (tISR). The end-point was the risk of a definitive stoma according to the type of anastomosis. RESULTS During the study period, 297 patients had SSR for low rectal cancer. The incidence of definitive stoma increased from 11% at 1 year to 22% at 10 years. The reasons were no closure of the loop ileostomy (4.7%), anastomotic morbidity (6.5%), anal incontinence (8%) and local recurrence (5.2%). The risk of definitive stoma was not influenced by type of surgery: 26% vs 18% vs 18% vs 19% (P = 0.578) for LCRA, CAA, pISR and tISR, respectively. Independent risk factors for definitive stoma were age > 65 years and surgical morbidity. CONCLUSION The risk of a definitive stoma after SSR increased two-fold between 1 and 10 years after surgery, from 11% to 22%. Ultralow conservative surgery (pISR and tISR) did not increase the risk of definitive stoma compared with conventional CAA or LCRA.","Celerier, B; Denost, Q; Van Geluwe, B; Pontallier, A; Rullier, E",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,565,1

However, the lesions of pneumonia in CT scans have wide variations in appearances, sizes, and locations in the lung regions, and the manifestations of COVID-19 in CT scans are also similar to other types of viral pneumonia, which hinders the further improvement of CNN-based methods. Delineating infection regions manually is a solution to this issue, while excessive workload of physicians during the epidemic makes it difficult for manual delineation. In this article, we propose a CNN called dense connectivity network with parallel attention module (PAM-DenseNet), which can perform well on coarse labels without manually delineated infection regions. The parallel attention module automatically learns to strengthen informative features from both channelwise and spatialwise simultaneously, which can make the network pay more attention to the infection regions without any manual delineation. The dense connectivity structure performs feature maps reuse by introducing direct connections from previous layers to all subsequent layers, which can extract representative features from fewer CT slices. The proposed network is first trained on 3530 lung CT slices selected from 382 COVID-19 lung CT scans, 372 lung CT scans infected by other pneumonia, and 200 normal lung CT scans to obtain a pretrained model for slicewise prediction. We then apply this pretrained model to a CT scans dataset containing 94 COVID-19 CT scans, 93 other pneumonia CT scans, and 93 normal lung scans, and achieve patientwise prediction through a voting mechanism. The experimental results show that the proposed network achieves promising results with an accuracy of 94.29%, a precision of 93.75%, a sensitivity of 95.74%, and a specificity of 96.77%, which is comparable to the methods that are based on manually delineated infection regions.","Xiao, Bin; Yang, Zeyu; Qiu, Xiaoming; Xiao, Jingjing; Wang, Guoyin; Zeng, Wenbing; Li, Weisheng; Nian, Yongjian; Chen, Wei",IEEE transactions on cybernetics,565,1

However, periprocedural outcome needs to be assessed for aiding treatment decision. PURPOSE To compare efficacy rates and periprocedural outcome (technical success, session time, hospitalization time, and complications) after renal tumor treatment with laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA). MATERIAL AND METHODS The initial experience with 49 (treated with LPN) and 84 (treated with RFA) consecutive patients for a single renal tumor (diameter ≤ 5 cm, limited to the kidney) during 2007-2014 was evaluated. Patient and tumor characteristics, efficacy rates, and periprocedural outcome were collected retrospectively. The stratified Mantel Haenzel and Van Elteren tests, adjusted for tumor complexity (with the modified R.E.N.A.L nephrometry score [m-RNS]), were used to assess differences in treatment outcomes. RESULTS Primary efficacy rate was 98% for LPN and 85.7% for RFA; secondary efficacy rate was 93.9% for LPN and 95.2% for RFA; and technical success rate was 87.8% for LPN and 100% for RFA. Median session (m-RNS adjusted P < 0.001; LPN 215 min, RFA 137 min) and median hospitalization time were longer after LPN (m-RNS adjusted P < 0.001; LPN 5 days, RFA 2 days). Side effects were uncommon (LPN 2%, RFA 4.8%). Complications were more frequent after LPN (m-RNS adjusted P < 0.001; LPN 42.9%, RFA 10.7%). CONCLUSION Both methods achieved equivalent secondary efficacy rates. RFA included several treatment sessions, but session and hospitalization times were shorter, and complications were less frequent than for LPN.

DESIGN-Open-label, noncomparative clinical trial. ANIMALS 12 cats suspected to have idiopathic epilepsy that was poorly controlled with phenobarbital or that had unacceptable adverse effects when treated with phenobarbital. PROCEDURES Cats were treated with levetiracetam (20 mg/kg [9.1 mg/lb], PO, q 8 h). After a minimum of 1 week of treatment, serum levetiracetam concentrations were measured before and 2, 4, and 6 hours after drug administration, and maximum and minimum serum concentrations and elimination half-life were calculated. Seizure frequencies before and after initiation of levetiracetam treatment were compared, and adverse effects were recorded. RESULTS Median maximum serum levetiracetam concentration was 25.5 microg/mL, median minimum serum levetiracetam concentration was 8.3 microg/mL, and median elimination half-life was 2.9 hours. Median seizure frequency prior to treatment with levetiracetam (2.1 seizures/mo) was significantly higher than median seizure frequency after initiation of levetiracetam treatment (0.42 seizures/mo), and 7 of 10 cats were classified as having responded to levetiracetam treatment (ie, reduction in seizure frequency of >or=50%).

METHODS In this longitudinal observational study, survivors of first-ever stroke were evaluated at rehabilitation discharge, 6, 12, and 24 months later. Moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) duration (minutes/day) assessed with an electronic monitor was the primary outcome. Further outcomes included step count, the number and duration of MVPA and sedentary bouts, cardiovascular risk factors (eg, blood pressure, fasting lipid profile, body mass index), gait speed and endurance, mood, fatigue, and cognition. Associations between physical activity and cardiovascular risk factors over time were assessed with random-effects regression modeling. Associations between baseline characteristics and physical activity at 2 years were explored using regression modeling. RESULTS Seventy-nine participants (68.4% men) with a mean age of 65 years (SD = 14) and a median gait speed of 1.2 m/s (interquartile range = 0.8-1.4) were included at baseline. Associations were found between higher physical activity (MVPA duration, number and duration of MVPA bouts) and lower body mass index. Better gait speed, endurance, and cognition at baseline were associated with higher MVPA and step count at 2 years. CONCLUSIONS Duration and bouts of MVPA are associated with body mass index. Increasing MVPA and bouts of MVPA may be a valuable treatment goal to reduce cardiovascular risk in survivors of stroke. IMPACT This 2-year study found that moderate to vigorous physical activity is associated with important cardiovascular risk factors in people who have survived stroke. Understanding these associations could be useful for developing effective treatments to prevent recurrent stroke.","Fini, Natalie A; Bernhardt, Julie; Churilov, Leonid; Clark, Rebecca; Holland, Anne E",Physical therapy,565,1

In addition, PCR is irreplaceable in the detection of uncultivable or fastidious rabbit pathogens or those occurring in low quantity in a tested sample. We provide herein an overview of the current state of the art in the molecular detection of lagomorph viral pathogens along with details of their targeted gene or nucleic acid sequence and recommendations for their application. Apart from the nucleic acids-based methods used for identification and comprehensive typing of rabbit viruses, novel methods such as microarray, next-generation sequencing, and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) could also be employed given that they offer greater throughput in sample screening for viral pathogens. Molecular methods should be provided with an appropriate set of controls, including an internal amplification control, to confirm the validity of the results obtained.","Kwit, Ewa; Rzeżutka, Artur","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",565,1

It is a challenge not only to identify these various aerosol types, but also to assess the optical and radiative implications of these components. In the present study, appropriate thresholds for fine-mode fraction and single-scattering albedo have been used to first identify the aerosol types over IGB. Four major aerosol types may be identified as polluted dust (PD), polluted continental (PC), black carbon-enriched (BCE), and organic carbon-enriched (OCE). Further, the implications of these different types of aerosols on optical properties and radiative forcing have been studied. The aerosol products derived from CIMEL sun/sky radiometer measurements, deployed under Aerosol Robotic Network program of NASA, USA were used from four different sites Karachi, Lahore, Jaipur, and Kanpur, spread over Pakistan and Northern India. PD is the most dominant aerosol type at Karachi and Jaipur, contributing more than 50% of all the aerosol types. OCE, on the other hand, contributes only about 12-15% at all the stations except at Kanpur where its contribution is ∼38%. The spectral dependence of AOD was relatively low for PD aerosol type, with the lowest AE values (<0.5); whereas, large spectral dependence in AOD was observed for the remaining aerosol types, with the highest AE values (>1.0). SSA was found to be the highest for OCE (>0.9) and the lowest for BCE (<0.9) type aerosols, with drastically different spectral variability. The direct aerosol radiative forcing at the surface and in the atmosphere was found to be the maximum at Lahore among all the four stations in the IGB.","Tiwari, S; Srivastava, A K; Singh, A K; Singh, Sachchidanand",Environmental science and pollution research international,565,5

However, methodological advances in electrophysiological recordings in non-human primates, including simultaneous recordings in multiple brain regions, have recently begun to reveal the pulvinar's functional contributions to selective attention. These new findings suggest that the pulvinar is critical for the efficient transmission of sensory information within and between cortical regions, both synchronizing cortical activity across brain regions and controlling cortical excitability. These new findings further suggest that the pulvinar's influence on cortical processing is embedded in a dynamic selection process that balances sensory and motor functions within the large-scale network that directs selective attention.","Kastner, Sabine; Fiebelkorn, Ian C; Eradath, Manoj K",Current opinion in neurobiology,565,1

A review of the regulatory status of these two self-care interventions can highlight processes required to ensure that the quality of the medicines and safety of individuals are safeguarded in the introduction and scale-up in countries. This review outlines the legal regulatory status of prescription-only medicine (POM) and OTC contraceptives, including emergency contraception, and drugs for medical abortion in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia using information obtained from internet searches, regulatory information databases and personal contacts. In addition, the review examines whether the national medicines regulatory authorities have documented procedures available to allow for a change in status from a POM to OTC to allow for increased accessibility, availability and uptake of self-care interventions recommended by WHO. Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon have a documented national OTC list available. The only contraceptive product mentioned in the OTC lists across all five countries is ellaOne (ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception), which is publicly registered in Lebanon. None of the five countries has an official documented procedure to apply for the change of POM to OTC. Informal procedures exist, such as the ability to apply to the national medicines regulatory authority for OTC status if the product has OTC status in the original country of manufacture. However, many of these procedures are not officially documented, highlighting the need for establishing sound, affordable and effective regulation of medical products as an important part of health system strengthening. From a public health perspective, it would be advantageous for licensed products to be available OTC. This is particularly the case for settings where the health system is under-resourced or over-stretched due to health emergencies. Readiness of national regulatory guidelines and OTC procedures could lead to increased access, availability and usage of essential self-care interventions for sexual and reproductive health and rights.","Ammerdorffer, Anne; Laws, Mark; Awiligwe, Arinze; Erb, Florence; Im-Amornphong, Wallada; Gülmezoglu, A Metin; Chinery, Lester; Lucido, Briana; Narasimhan, Manjulaa",Health research policy and systems,565,19

As sex and age influence the autonomic function associated with BP regulation our study compared BP measurements in supine and sitting positions for men and women of different ages. METHODS We included 91 men and 118 women (≥18 years) without severe diseases. Hypertension was not an exclusion criterion because it is common in older persons. Mean left brachial BP and heart rate were determined by a digital sphygmomanometer in supine position as well as in sitting position before and after hand force measurement. RESULTS In a supine position women had slightly lower diastolic BP values than men. After sitting up, the diastolic BP increased in nearly all subjects. This increase was greater in women older than 50 years than for aged-matched men. In contrast to diastolic BP the systolic BP increased after sitting up in only two thirds of the subjects. Especially in women younger than 50 years the systolic BP often did not increase but decreased in response to postural change. The pulse pressure was mostly reduced after sitting up. This reduction was more pronounced in women than men independent of age and physical effort (i.e. hand force measurement). The sitting position also caused an increased heart rate, which was independent of sex and age. CONCLUSION Postural changes in the systolic and diastolic BP simultaneously depend on sex and age that needs to be considered for BP measurements in supine and sitting body positions.","Bartling, Babett; Schwarzmann, Luisa; Pliquett, Rainer Ullrich; Simm, Andreas; Hofmann, Britt",Zeitschrift fur Gerontologie und Geriatrie,565,1

To separate the effects of chronological age and birth cohort from biological age, longitudinal studies investigating the associations of GDF15 levels with adverse health outcomes are needed. We investigated changes in GDF15 levels over 10 years in an age-stratified sample of the general population and their relation to the risk of acute hospitalization and death. Serum levels of GDF15 were measured three times in 5-year intervals in 2176 participants aged 30, 40, 50, or 60 years from the Danish population-based DAN-MONICA cohort. We assessed the association of single and repeated GDF15 measurements with the risk of non-traumatic acute hospitalizations. We tested whether changes in GDF15 levels over 10 years differed according to the frequency of hospitalizations within 2 years or survival within 20 years, after the last GDF15 measurement. The change in GDF15 levels over time was dependent on age and sex. Higher GDF15 levels and a greater increase in GDF15 levels were associated with an increased risk of acute hospitalization in adjusted Cox regression analyses. Participants with more frequent admissions within 2 years, and those who died within 20 years, after the last GDF15 measurement already had elevated GDF15 levels at baseline and experienced greater increases in GDF15 levels during the study. The change in GDF15 levels was associated with changes in C-reactive protein and biomarkers of kidney, liver, and cardiac function. Monitoring of GDF15 starting in middle-aged could be valuable for the prediction of adverse health outcomes.","Tavenier, Juliette; Andersen, Ove; Nehlin, Jan O; Petersen, Janne",GeroScience,565,33

Ang II, in turn, affects the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to induce heart remodeling. The specific mechanisms by which ACE2 regulates MMP-2, however, remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulatory relationships between Ang II, ACE2, and MMP-2. ACE2 expression was upregulated and downregulated in human cardiofibroblasts (HCFs) by lentiviral infection. Effects on MMP-2 activity, shed ACE2 activity, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, and ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17) expression were assessed. ACE2 increased MMP-2 activity, and Ang II inhibited this effect through the Ang II type-1 receptor (AT1R) and ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Ang II also reduced the effect of ACE2 on ERK1/2 levels, the activity of shed ACE2, and adam17 expression in HCFs. Additionally, these Ang II-mediated reductions could be attenuated by AT1R antagonist valsartan. In conclusion, these data help to clarify how ACE2 and Ang II interact to regulate MMP-2 and control tissue remodeling in heart disease.","Kuan, Tang-Ching; Chen, Mu-Yuan; Liao, Yan-Chiou; Ko, Li; Hong, Yi-Han; Yen, Chun-Yi; Hsieh, Wen-Yeh; Cheng, Kun-Shan; Wu, Chien-Liang; Lin, Chih-Sheng",Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,565,33

We report our 5 years experience with LSG as a single-stage bariatric procedure with which to study the technical progress, learning curve, complications, and follow-up results. METHODS Prospectively collected data of 228 patients (145 females and 83 males), who underwent LSG for morbid obesity, from February 2007 to March 2012, was retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS The mean age was 34.68 years (range, 18-62 years) and the mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 37.42 ± 4.75 kg/m(2) (range, 32.08-65.69 kg/m(2)). Mean operative time was 60.63 ± 27.37 min. The mean BMI decreased to 26.15 ± 3.71 kg/m(2) at 3 years (p < 0.001) and to 27.94 ± 4.08 kg/m(2) at 5 years (p < 0.001). Mean percentage excess weight loss was 71.96 ± 21.30 % at 3 years and 63.71 ± 20.08 % at 5 years. The 30-day readmission rate was 3.07 %.Overall complication rate was 4.3 %, including strictures, leaks, peritonitis, gastrocutaneous fistula, and one (0.43 %) mortality. One patient with weight regain and another with stricture underwent conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Complication rates significantly decreased after the first 50 cases (p = 0.022), suggesting an initial learning curve. Resolution of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia was 66.67, 100, and 50 %, respectively, at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS LSG as a single-stage bariatric procedure is safe and durable, achieving weight loss and resolution of comorbidities up to 5 years. Adherence to technical details is pivotal in reducing complications associated with the initial learning phase.","Zachariah, Sanoop Koshy; Chang, Po-Chih; Ooi, Andrea Se En; Hsin, Ming-Che; Kin Wat, Jason Yiu; Huang, Chih Kun",Obesity surgery,565,15

Face masks are acknowledged for effective viral aerosol shedding reduction. COVID-19 pandemic generated an opportunity to study the impact of face masks and confinement on droplet transmission diseases, usually implicated in acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). We aimed to evaluate the variation on severe AECOPD (sAECOPD) rate in a Portuguese COPD cohort during the first COVID-19 lockdown and following months. This retrospective self-controlled study enrolled 322 adult patients followed at COPD-specialized consultation in a tertiary hospital from February 2016 to July 2020, of whom 286 met inclusion criteria. Severe AECOPD events were registered from March 2020 (beginning of state of emergency) until July 2020. From 2016 to 2019 there was a mean of 38 patients per year with sAECOPD. During 2020, 11 patients experienced sAECOPD. Over the course of 2020 there was a 73.4% (p < 0.001) decrease in sAECOPD events comparing with previous years' average. After the end of State of Emergency, the rate of sAECOPD events also declined by 74.6% (p < 0.001) comparing with the same timeline of previous years. Results were consistent and statistically significant when comparing 2020 with each of previous years for every period of analysis. Our findings suggest a sustained decrease in the rate of sAECOPD during confinement and in the following months. The widespread use of face mask and social distancing during COVID-19 pandemic may play an important role in preventing the transmission of respiratory infections and consequently reducing sAECOPD.","Faria, Nuno; Costa, Maria Inês; Gomes, Joana; Sucena, Maria",COPD,565,1

To describe the pathogenesis and significance of viral infection in terms of host responses, resultant injury, and therapy, we focused on two RNA viruses: lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV) and influenza (Flu). Many of the currently established concepts and consequences about viruses and immunologic tolerance, virus-induced immunosuppression, virus-induced autoimmunity, immune complex disease, and virus-lymphocyte and virus-dendritic cell interactions evolved through studies of LCMV in its natural murine host. Similarly, the mechanisms, aftermath, and treatment of persistent RNA viruses emerged, in large part, from research on LCMV. Analysis of acute influenza virus infections uncovered the prominent direct role that cytokine storm plays in the pathogenesis, morbidity, and mortality from this disease. Cytokine storm of influenza virus infection is initiated via a pulmonary endothelial cell amplification loop involving IFN-producing cells and virus-infected pulmonary epithelial cells. Importantly, the cytokine storm is chemically treatable with specific agonist therapy directed to the sphingosphine 1 phosphate receptor 1, which is located on pulmonary endothelial cells, pointing to the endothelial cells as the gatekeepers of this hyperaggressive host immune response.","Oldstone, Michael B A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,565,16

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We hypothesize that serum amyloid P component (SAP), which has a species-specific, DNA-binding ability, contributes to the differences between human and mice and then limits DNA vaccine's efficacy in vivo. In our study, DNA vaccine-induced adaptive immune responses were also significantly decreased in the human SAP (hSAP) transgenic mice. Using human promonocytic cell line THP-1-derived macrophages as a cell model, we found that cells incubated with a hSAP-DNA complex showed significant defects in innate immune activations, whereas mouse SAP had similar, albeit very weak, activities. hSAP also significantly inhibited the functions of two identified DNA sentinels, high-mobility group B protein 1 and antimicrobial peptide LL37, and redirected DNA update to FcRs leading to endocytosis and endosomal degradation. We also found that a chemical SAP inhibitor strongly recovered the suppressed innate immune responses to DNA in the presence of human serum and enhanced the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines in vivo. Our data indicated that SAP is a key negative regulator for innate immune responses to DNA and may be partly responsible for the insufficient immune responses after DNA vaccinations in humans. SAP suppression may be a novel strategy for improving efficacy of human DNA vaccines and requires further clinical investigations.","Wang, Yue; Guo, Yingjun; Wang, Xiaohui; Huang, Jinfeng; Shang, Jingli; Sun, Shuhan",Journal of immunology,565,1

Patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection had more severe hypoxemic respiratory failure (PaO2/FIO2: 106 [66, 160] vs 176 [104, 252]; p < 0.001) and more frequent nonrespiratory organ failure (nonrespiratory Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score: 6 [4, 9] vs 5 [3, 7]; p = 0.002), thus required more frequently invasive mechanical ventilation (85.2% vs 73.0%; p < 0.001), oxygen rescue therapies (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 5.8% vs 0.9%; p = 0.003), vasopressor support (79.4% vs 55.0%; p < 0.001), and renal replacement therapy (48.8% vs 22.1%; p < 0.001). After adjustment for potential confounding factors, Middle East respiratory syndrome was independently associated with death compared to non-Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection (adjusted odds ratio, 5.87; 95% CI, 4.02-8.56; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Substantial overlap exists in the clinical presentation and comorbidities among patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection from other etiologies; therefore, a high index of suspicion combined with diagnostic testing is essential component of severe acute respiratory infection investigation for at-risk patients. The lack of distinguishing clinical features, the need to rely on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction from respiratory samples, variability in viral shedding duration, lack of effective therapy, and high mortality represent substantial clinical challenges and help guide ongoing clinical research efforts.","Arabi, Yaseen M; Al-Omari, Awad; Mandourah, Yasser; Al-Hameed, Fahad; Sindi, Anees A; Alraddadi, Basem; Shalhoub, Sarah; Almotairi, Abdullah; Al Khatib, Kasim; Abdulmomen, Ahmed; Qushmaq, Ismael; Mady, Ahmed; Solaiman, Othman; Al-Aithan, Abdulsalam M; Al-Raddadi, Rajaa; Ragab, Ahmed; Al Mekhlafi, Ghaleb A; Al Harthy, Abdulrahman; Kharaba, Ayman; Ahmadi, Mashael Al; Sadat, Musharaf; Mutairi, Hanan Al; Qasim, Eman Al; Jose, Jesna; Nasim, Maliha; Al-Dawood, Abdulaziz; Merson, Laura; Fowler, Robert; Hayden, Frederick G; Balkhy, Hanan H",Critical care medicine,565,16

METHODS From June 1993 to May 2008, 113 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of the GC were considered for laparoscopic gastrectomy at our institution. There was a predominance of males and mean age was 60 years. After peritoneal cavity inspection, laparoscopic ultrasound was used to determine the presence of deep liver metastasis. Total gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y reconstruction were performed in upper and middle-third tumors, and subtotal gastrectomy, either with Billroth II or Roux-en-Y reconstruction, in tumors affecting the lower third of the stomach. D2 lymphadenectomy was performed in both cases. RESULTS There were 21 cases (18.5%) with distant metastases and/or an unresectable tumor due to the invasion of adjacent organs. In these patients the procedure was limited to laparoscopic biopsy in 16 cases and laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy in 5 cases. Laparoscopic gastrectomy was performed in 92 patients with a mean surgical time of 162 minutes and a mortality rate of 5.4%. Conversion was necessary in 7 cases (7.6%). CONCLUSIONS The benefits and safety of laparoscopic gastrectomy are evident, with similar outcomes to conventional surgery and all the advantages of minimally invasive access. The learning curve is long. Laparoscopic gastrectomy is a safe and effective option for the treatment of GC, avoiding nontherapeutic laparotomy in patients with advanced disease. Comparative prospective studies evaluating the long-term survival of these patients are still necessary.","Tinoco, Renam C; Tinoco, Augusto C A; El-Kadre, Luciana J; Sueth, Daniela M; Conde, Lauro M","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",565,16

While medical students wanted high-quality, consolidated educational resources on COVID-19, the medical school faculty who typically produced such resources were increasingly burdened with clinical, administrative, and personal commitments. However, students eager to contribute to the pandemic response were well-suited to create these instructional materials for their peers. APPROACH In mid-March 2020, a group of students at Harvard Medical School came together to synthesize the key facts and collate the best existing educational materials about the COVID-19 pandemic into a unified learning resource. The materials were faculty reviewed and shared freely online. The curriculum now contains 8 modules that are updated regularly. Throughout this process, the student authors prioritized accessibility, iterative improvement, and effective pedagogy. OUTCOMES To date, nearly 80,000 users from 132 countries have accessed the curriculum. It has been referenced or incorporated into courses at Harvard Medical School and more than 30 other medical schools across the country. About 40% of all users are from outside the United States, and the materials have been translated into 28 languages. This effort has spurred a number of other educational initiatives led by medical student groups in the United States and abroad. NEXT STEPS As understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic is constantly changing, the student authors' immediate goal is to keep the curriculum up to date in the months to come. They plan to maintain existing partnerships with medical schools and student groups around the world while pursuing new opportunities to expand the curriculum's reach, provide education, and build community. Students and educators alike should leverage student-driven education efforts to benefit other learners both within and importantly beyond their institutions.","Kochis, Michael; Goessling, Wolfram",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,565,31

We sought to quantify a simulated edema-induced pressure within a fiberglass short arm cast and to determine the effectiveness of different cast-cutting methods for pressure reduction. We hypothesized that cast cutting could eliminate all clinically relevant pressure and Ace wrap would insignificantly increase pressure. METHODS Skin surface pressure under fiberglass short arm casts was measured on ninety wrists from forty-five volunteers randomly assigned to one cast-cutting method: single-cut (cast bivalve and Ace wrap), double-cut (cast bivalve, spread, and Ace wrap), or triple-cut (cast bivalve, spread, Webril cut, and Ace wrap). Each wrist was immobilized in a cast in the neutral position with one roll of 2-inch (5.1-cm) cotton Webril and one roll of 2-inch (5.1-cm) fiberglass. Each fiberglass short arm cast contained an empty intravenous fluid bag in which we infused air. This simulated edema, which generated a skin surface pressure, which was measured by a pressure transducer. RESULTS Each cast-cutting method significantly reduced (p < 0.0001) the skin surface pressure from the average maximum of 92.5 mm Hg in a non-fracture setting. Prior to Ace wrapping, there was a reduction in skin surface pressure of 70.8% for the single-cut method, 85.1% for the double-cut method, and 99.9% for the triple-cut method. Ace wrap significantly increased skin surface pressure (p < 0.0001), lessening the effectiveness of cast cutting. There was an overall reduction in skin surface pressure of 55.9% for the single-cut method, 64.3% for the double-cut method, and 77.2% for the triple-cut method. Throughout our study, women had significantly higher skin surface pressure than men (p < 0.0001); the average maximum was 104.4 mm Hg for women and 81.1 mm Hg for men. CONCLUSIONS The single-cut method provides the greatest pressure reduction, but only the triple-cut method eliminated all relevant skin surface pressure. Ace wrapping a cut cast noticeably increased skin surface pressure. CLINICAL RELEVANCE In volunteers without a fracture, only the triple-cut method is effective enough to eliminate clinically relevant skin surface pressure. Ace wrap should be applied with caution after the cast is cut. The specific effect on pressure reduction in a patient who requires some soft-tissue pressure to maintain fracture reduction was not studied.","Zaino, Christian J; Patel, Mukund R; Arief, Melissa S; Pivec, Robert",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

Here, we performed a meta-analysis on existing lung cancer gene expression results to identify Meta-signature genes without noise. In this study, functional enrichment, protein-protein interaction network, the DAVID, String, TfactS, and transcription factor binding were performed based on the gene expression profiles of lung adenocarcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer deposited in the GEO database. As a result, a total of 574 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) affecting the pathogenesis of lung cancer were identified (207 up-regulated expression and 367 down-regulated expression in lung cancer tissues). A total of 5,093 interactions existed among the 507 (88.3%) proteins, and 10 Meta-signatures were identified: AURKA, CCNB1, KIF11, CCNA2, TOP2A, CENPF, KIF2C, TPX2, HMMR, and MAD2L1. The potential biological functions of Meta-signature DEGs were revealed. In summary, this study identified key genes involved in the process of lung cancer.

A wide range of real-time PCR (rtPCR) assays are used in our laboratory (National Veterinary Institute, Technical University of Denmark) for pathogen detection, and PCR analyses are performed on traditional rtPCR platforms in which a limited number of samples can be analyzed per day given limitations in equipment and personnel. To mitigate these restrictions, rtPCR assays have been optimized for the high-throughput rtPCR BioMark platform (Fluidigm). Using this platform, we developed a high-throughput detection system that can be used for simultaneous examination of 48 samples with detection specificity for 18 selected respiratory and enteric viral and bacterial pathogens of high importance to Danish pig production. The rtPCR assays were validated and optimized to run under the same reaction conditions using a BioMark 48.48 dynamic array (DA) integrated fluidic circuit chip, and the sensitivity and specificity were assessed by testing known positive samples. Performance of the 48.48DA was similar to traditional rtPCR analysis, and the specificity of the 48.48DA was high.

Prevalence of GDM differs by country/region due to ethnicity, lifestyle and diagnostic criteria. We compared GDM rates and risk factors in two Asian cohorts using the 1999 WHO and the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria. METHODS The Shanghai Birth Cohort (SBC) and the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort are prospective birth cohorts. Information on sociodemographic characteristics and medical history were collected from interviewer-administered questionnaires. Participants underwent a 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks gestation. Logistic regressions were performed. RESULTS Using the 1999 WHO criteria, the prevalence of GDM was higher in GUSTO (20.8%) compared to SBC (16.6%) (p = 0.046). Family history of hypertension and alcohol consumption were associated with higher odds of GDM in SBC than in GUSTO cohort while obesity was associated with higher odds of GDM in GUSTO. Using the IADPSG criteria, the prevalence of GDM was 14.3% in SBC versus 12.0% in GUSTO. A history of GDM was associated with higher odds of GDM in GUSTO than in SBC, while being overweight, alcohol consumption and family history of diabetes were associated with higher odds of GDM in SBC. CONCLUSIONS We observed several differential risk factors of GDM among ethnic Chinese women living in Shanghai and Singapore.

Clinically, it presents as a progressive fatal neurologic syndrome that is not easily distinguished from other feline neurologic conditions. Most cases of FSE have been reported in England, where it was first detected in 1990, but a few cases have been reported from other European countries. To identify possible cases of FSE in Italy, the Italian Ministry of Health funded a 2-year surveillance project during which the brains from 110 domestic cats with neurologic signs were evaluated histologically for spongiform encephalopathy and immunohistochemically to detect PrP(sc).

We aimed to understand variations in practice amongst specialist pediatric gastroenterology centers (SPGIC) in the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS A survey was sent to all UK SPGIC (n = 29) providing endoscopy services for CD diagnosis. It was divided into four main subgroups: analyzing diagnosis of CD through adherence to the ESPGHAN guidelines, post-diagnosis care and long-term follow-up and discharge from pediatric services. RESULTS All 29 responded. NBP was implemented in 28/29 centers. 5/29 centers had already stopped HLA-DQ2/8 testing for NBP diagnosis. 26/29 centers were performing endoscopy on screening-identified children (mostly asymptomatic, 'at-risk' patients). Diagnosis was communicated by a doctor in 65% SPGIC [n = 19]. Most centers [n = 23] waited 6-12 months post-diagnosis to start gluten-free oats. Routine vitamin-D supplementation was commenced by 4/29 centers. All centers repeated IgA-TGA to assess normalisation but at varying times post-GFD. Follow-up was with a combination of doctors/dieticians [n = 26]. 11/29 centers discharged their patient to primary care. CONCLUSIONS There was excellent uptake of ESPGHAN guidelines (2012) in the UK and adherence to guidelines is generally good. Despite published evidence and pragmatic advice from the British Society of Gastroenterology and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, significant differences remain in diagnostic and ongoing management practice and are opportunities for research and directive evidence-based follow-up guidance.","Paul, Siba Prosad; Balakumar, Varathagini; Gillett, Peter Michael",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,565,1

A systematic review.,19.158232,7.700647,2021-09-11,"BACKGROUND Evidence exists that during pressure support ventilation (PSV), the addition of an extrinsic (ie, ventilator-generated) breath-to-breath variability (BBV) of breathing pattern improves respiratory function. If BBV is beneficial per se, choosing the PS level that maximizes it could be considered a valid strategy for conventional PSV. In this study, we evaluated the effect of different PS levels on intrinsic BBV in acutely ill, mechanically ventilated subjects to determine whether a significant relationship exists between PS level and BBV magnitude. METHODS Fourteen invasively mechanically ventilated subjects were prospectively studied. PS was adjusted at 20 cm H2O and sequentially reduced to 15, 10, and 5 cm H2O. Arterial blood gas analysis and pressure at 0.1 s after the onset of inspiration (P0.1) were measured at each PS level. Airway and esophageal pressure and air flow were continuously recorded. Peak inspiratory flow, tidal volume (VT), breathing frequency, and pressure-time product (PTP) were calculated on a breath-by-breath basis. The breathing pattern variability was assessed by the coefficient of variation of the time series of VT, peak inspiratory flow, and breathing frequency from ∼ 60 consecutive breath cycles at each PS level. A general linear model for repeated measures was applied, with PS as an independent factor. A significance level of .05 was considered. RESULTS Despite a large inter-individual difference in all measured variables (P < .001), the coefficient of variation was as low as 30%, and no significant differences in the coefficient of variation of peak inspiratory flow, breathing frequency, and VT between PS levels were observed (P > .15). Additionally, a significant increase in P0.1, PTP, and breathing frequency (P < .01) and a reduction in VT (P < .001) were observed with PS reduction. CONCLUSIONS Despite a significant increase in spontaneous activity with PS reduction, BBV was not influenced by the PS level and was as low as 30% for all evaluated parameters.","Cruz, Monica R; Camilo, Luciana M; Paula, Luis Felipe S C; Japiassú, Andre M; Beda, Alessandro; Carvalho, Alysson R; Bozza, Fernando A; Medeiros, Denise M",Respiratory care,565,1

Apart from depression, other psychiatric disorders and symptoms such as bipolar disorder, pseudobulbar affect, euphoria sclerotica, anxiety and personality changes are also reported to be overpresented in MS patients. Psychiatric disorders in MS lead to significant disruption in patients' family, work and social life, affecting patients' quality of life in general. Moreover, they are reported to be associated with poorer adherence to MS medication. The literature concerning bipolar disorder and affect disorders in MS is rather scarce. The purpose of this article is to provide a critical review on the latter subject. RECENT FINDINGS This review focuses upon the recent findings with regard to the epidemiology and the comorbidity rates of bipolar and affect disorders in MS, questions raised about the potential underlying mechanisms that could explain such a high comorbidity, diagnostic issues and the recent developments in the treatment of those psychiatric disorders in MS. SUMMARY Despite the fact that the higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders in MS is well established, such disorders still remain underdiagnosed and undertreated. A shift in the clinical suspicion towards the psychiatric morbidity in MS patients and the optimal treatment of those disorders is fundamental.","Iacovides, Apostolos; Andreoulakis, Elias",Current opinion in psychiatry,565,20

Both hyperthermia, i.e., heating to 39-45 °C to induce sensitization to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and thermal ablation, where temperatures beyond 50 °C destroy tumor cells directly are frequently applied in the clinic. Achievement of an effective treatment requires high quality heating equipment, precise thermal dosimetry, and adequate quality assurance. Several types of devices, antennas and heating or power delivery systems have been proposed and developed in recent decades. These vary considerably in technique, heating depth, ability to focus, and in the size of the heating focus. Clinically used heating techniques involve electromagnetic and ultrasonic heating, hyperthermic perfusion and conductive heating. Depending on clinical objectives and available technology, thermal therapies can be subdivided into three broad categories: local, locoregional, or whole body heating. Clinically used local heating techniques include interstitial hyperthermia and ablation, high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), scanned focused ultrasound (SFUS), electroporation, nanoparticle heating, intraluminal heating and superficial heating. Locoregional heating techniques include phased array systems, capacitive systems and isolated perfusion. Whole body techniques focus on prevention of heat loss supplemented with energy deposition in the body, e.g., by infrared radiation. This review presents an overview of clinical hyperthermia and ablation devices used for local, locoregional, and whole body therapy. Proven and experimental clinical applications of thermal ablation and hyperthermia are listed.

We present a consecutive case series of patients with ECAPs treated with endovascular therapy, and a pertinent literature review. METHODS A prospectively maintained database of neuroendovascular procedures was retrospectively reviewed for cases of ECAP treated between January 2007 and December 2012. The primary outcome of interest was incidence of periprocedural (within 30 days) neurologic and cardiopulmonary complications. PubMed was searched for relevant endovascular studies from 2000 to 2012 for the review. RESULTS In our series, 12 patients with 14 ECAPs received stents, with or without coils. No perioperative neurologic or cardiopulmonary complications occurred. Median duration of clinical follow-up was 6.25 months (range 0-50 months), and median duration of imaging follow-up was 6.25 months (range 0-50 months), with eight patients asymptomatic and three showing improved symptoms (one patient with two lesions was lost to follow-up). Literature review revealed an overall primary outcome of 8.6% and no procedure related deaths. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of ECAP is safe and effective at improving symptoms. There were no perioperative or permanent neurologic sequelae in the 11 patients with follow-up, and all symptomatology related to ECAP improved or resolved with treatment.","Seward, Christopher J; Dumont, Travis M; Levy, Elad I",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,565,17

A tremendous amount of work has been accumulating to decipher the RNA moieties required for an RLR agonist, the signal transduction pathway leading to activation of the innate immunity orchestrated by type I interferon (IFN), the cellular and viral regulators of this pathway, and the viral inhibitors of the innate immune response. Previous reviews have focused on the RLR signaling pathway and on the negative regulation of the interferon response by viral proteins. The focus of this review is to put this knowledge in the context of the virus replication cycle within a cell. Likewise, there has been an expansion of knowledge about the role of innate immunity in the pathophysiology of viral infection. As a consequence, some discrepancies have arisen between the current models of cell-intrinsic innate immunity and current knowledge of virus biology. This holds particularly true for the nonsegmented negative-strand viruses (Mononegavirales), which paradoxically have been largely used to build presently available models. The aim of this review is to bridge the gap between the virology and innate immunity to favor the rational building of a relevant model(s) describing the interplay between Mononegavirales and the innate immune system.","Gerlier, Denis; Lyles, Douglas S",Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,565,1

We aim to assess and summarize the overall predictive ability of ML algorithms in cardiovascular diseases. A comprehensive search strategy was designed and executed within the MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus databases from database inception through March 15, 2019. The primary outcome was a composite of the predictive ability of ML algorithms of coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, and cardiac arrhythmias. Of 344 total studies identified, 103 cohorts, with a total of 3,377,318 individuals, met our inclusion criteria. For the prediction of coronary artery disease, boosting algorithms had a pooled area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 (95% CI 0.84-0.91), and custom-built algorithms had a pooled AUC of 0.93 (95% CI 0.85-0.97). For the prediction of stroke, support vector machine (SVM) algorithms had a pooled AUC of 0.92 (95% CI 0.81-0.97), boosting algorithms had a pooled AUC of 0.91 (95% CI 0.81-0.96), and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms had a pooled AUC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.83-0.95). Although inadequate studies for each algorithm for meta-analytic methodology for both heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias because the confidence intervals overlap between different methods, showing no difference, SVM may outperform other algorithms in these areas. The predictive ability of ML algorithms in cardiovascular diseases is promising, particularly SVM and boosting algorithms. However, there is heterogeneity among ML algorithms in terms of multiple parameters. This information may assist clinicians in how to interpret data and implement optimal algorithms for their dataset.","Krittanawong, Chayakrit; Virk, Hafeez Ul Hassan; Bangalore, Sripal; Wang, Zhen; Johnson, Kipp W; Pinotti, Rachel; Zhang, HongJu; Kaplin, Scott; Narasimhan, Bharat; Kitai, Takeshi; Baber, Usman; Halperin, Jonathan L; Tang, W H Wilson",Scientific reports,565,5

OBJECTIVE We compared the early postoperative outcome in robot-assisted IPAA with open surgery procedures. DESIGN This was an observational study based on prospectively collected data obtained from chart reviews. SETTING The single-center data set covers patients operated on from January 13, 2004, to September 16, 2014, at a specialist center. PATIENTS Patients with ulcerative colitis undergoing IPAA surgery were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Study end points included the duration of operation, admission length, complications (Clavien-Dindo), reoperations, and readmissions. RESULTS Eighty-one robot-assisted and 170 open IPAA procedures were performed. The duration of operation was significantly longer for robot-assisted laparoscopic procedures (mean difference, 154 minutes; CI, 140-170). During a mean follow-up of 102 days, no significant differences in the distribution of complications were found (Spearman p = 0.12; p = 0.07), and no postoperative deaths occurred in either group. Postoperative admission length was shorter following robot-assisted procedures (mean difference, -1.9; CI, -3.5 to -0.3), whereas 40% of patients were readmitted, compared with 26% of patients who had open surgery (OR, 1.9; CI, 1.1-3.4). Pouch failure occurred in 3 patients (1 following robot-assisted laparoscopy; 2 following open surgery). On multivariate regression analyses, robot-assisted laparoscopy was associated with a significantly longer duration of operation (mean difference, 159 minutes; CI, 144-174), and more readmissions for any cause (OR, 2; CI, 1.1-3.7). LIMITATIONS This was a nonrandomized, single-center observational study. CONCLUSION In this implementation phase, robot-assisted IPAA surgery offers acceptable short-term outcomes. The limitations of this observational study call for randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up and exploration of functional results.","Mark-Christensen, Anders; Pachler, Frederik Rønne; Nørager, Charlotte Buchard; Jepsen, Peter; Laurberg, Søren; Tøttrup, Anders",Diseases of the colon and rectum,565,8

However, the use of a collimator will substantially decrease the sensitivity of the gamma camera. The aim of this article is to enable departments to calculate the uncertainty of SeHCAT retention measurements so that the acquisition time can be optimised to perform a reliable SeHCAT study. METHOD We derive a mathematical equation from the first principles that can be used to calculate the uncertainty in SeHCAT retention measurements on the basis of Poisson counting statistics. The equation takes account of background subtraction, use of the geometric mean for anterior/posterior attenuation compensation and the day 7 to day 0 quotient calculation. RESULTS Uncertainties in SeHCAT retention measurement using an intrinsic (uncollimated) gamma camera counting for 100 s are very low, typically of the order 15 ± 0.1%. Uncertainties from collimated gamma camera counting significantly increase for the same 100 s counting duration: 15 ± 0.8% for slim patients and 15 ± 4% for obese patients. CONCLUSION The acquisition time must be increased for collimated gamma camera SeHCAT counting to achieve acceptable counting statistics for an acceptable total uncertainty in the SeHCAT retention measurement. For slim patients, a minimum counting time of 2 min is required. For larger patients, the acquisition time needs to be increased to 30 min and further increased to 50 min for obese patients.","James, Gregory; Notghi, Alp; O'Brien, Joseph; Thomson, William",Nuclear medicine communications,565,23

However, they are often uni-dimensional or focus mainly on therapeutic relationship and environment, and neglect other important issues such as information about treatment and participation. The BEST questionnaires were developed as comprehensive instruments that include items on all of the mentioned topics. The present study evaluates the psychometric properties of the BEST in a version for adolescents and for parents. Furthermore, the dimensionality of the satisfaction ratings is analyzed. METHOD Descriptive statistics were applied to data of 1582 adolescents (mean age = 15.0 years, SD = 1.65; 62.4% female) and 1998 parents/guardians assessed in seven in-patient units across Germany. The factorial structure of the BEST questionnaires was determined by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, including a bifactor model. RESULTS The psychometric quality of the scales was strong. Correlations with another assessment instrument of patient satisfaction were good to high, indicating good convergent validity. Exploratory factor analyses revealed three factors in adolescents that were labelled as: Therapeutic relationship, environment, and general satisfaction and treatment success. For parents, the same three factors could be distinguished. Confirmatory bifactor models suggested that the vast majority of variance was accounted for by the general factor; the three specific factors provided some additional information. Agreement between the subscales of adolescents and their parents was only moderate. Parents were usually more satisfied. CONCLUSIONS The BEST questionnaires can be considered as reliable and valid instruments to not only assess the ""classical"" aspects of patient satisfaction, but to also assess newer fundamental topics such as children's rights and treatment participation. For scientific usage, the total score seems superior because of the high explained variance by the general factor, but the subscale scores provide further information. The use of single items seems advantageous for quality management purposes.","Keller, Ferdinand; Naumann, Alexander; Fegert, Jörg M",Child and adolescent psychiatry and mental health,565,16

Here, we demonstrated that the closely related EHV, EHV-4, also uses this strategy for cellular invasion, both in equine cells in culture and in the heterologous, non-permissive murine mastocytoma cell line (P815) after stable transfection with horse MHC-I genes. Using a panel of P815 cell lines transfected with individual horse MHC-I genes, we provided support for the hypothesis that EHV-1 and EHV-4 target classical polymorphic MHC-I molecules as viral entry receptors. All known equine MHC-I molecules from the two principal classical polymorphic loci specify alanine at position 173 (A173), whilst other MHC-I loci encoded different amino acids at this position and did not permit viral entry. Site-directed mutagenesis of position 173 diminished or enhanced viral entry, depending upon the initial amino acid. However, there were other, as yet undefined, constraints to this process: MHC-I genes from two non-classical loci carried A173 but did not enable viral entry in P815 transfectants. Our study suggested that the capacity to bind MHC-I molecules arose in the common ancestor of EHV-1 and EHV-4. The widespread occurrence of A173 in classical polymorphic horse MHC-I molecules indicated that horses of most MHC haplotypes should be susceptible to infection via this entry portal.","Azab, Walid; Harman, Rebecca; Miller, Donald; Tallmadge, Rebecca; Frampton, Arthur R; Antczak, Douglas F; Osterrieder, Nikolaus",The Journal of general virology,565,23

RESULTS Twenty-eight studies were included of whom 24 were before-and-after studies and 4 were studies comparing outcomes between non-randomised groups. Interventions included referral pathways, staff reconfiguration, new healthcare facilities and telemedicine. The strongest evidence for admission prevention was seen in asthma-specific referral pathways (n=6) showing 34% (95% CI 28 to 39) reduction, but with evidence of publication bias. Other pathways showed inconsistent results or were insufficient for wider interpretation. Staffing reconfiguration showed reduced admissions in two studies, and shorter length of stay in one. Short stay admission units reduced admissions in three studies.

Before effective treatments, countering the spread of these infections depends on mitigating, protective behaviours such as social distancing, respecting lockdown, wearing masks, frequent handwashing, travel restrictions, and vaccine acceptance. Previous work has shown that the enacting protective behaviours depends on beliefs about individual vulnerability, threat severity, and one's ability to engage in such protective actions. However, little is known about the genesis of these beliefs in response to an infectious disease epidemic, and the cognitive mechanisms that may link these beliefs to decision making. Active inference (AI) is a recent approach to behavioural modelling that integrates embodied perception, action, belief updating, and decision making. This approach provides a framework to understand the behaviour of agents in situations that require planning under uncertainty. It assumes that the brain infers the hidden states that cause sensations, predicts the perceptual feedback produced by adaptive actions, and chooses actions that minimize expected surprise in the future. In this paper, we present a computational account describing how individuals update their beliefs about the risks and thereby commit to protective behaviours. We show how perceived risks, beliefs about future states, sensory uncertainty, and outcomes under each policy can determine individual protective behaviours. We suggest that these mechanisms are crucial to assess how individuals cope with uncertainty during a pandemic, and we show the interest of these new perspectives for public health policies.","Bottemanne, Hugo; Friston, Karl J","Cognitive, affective & behavioral neuroscience",565,1

The functional links between IgA deposition, inflammation, and matrix remodelling are not well characterized. We recently performed urine liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry proteomics and identified multiple ECM glycoproteins whose expression and function in IgAN is unclear. None of the urine glycoproteins was regulated in IgAN transcriptomics, indicating that tissue remodelling rather than increased expression might contribute to their presence in urine. To investigate this, we examined the IgAN expression profile of metalloproteinases, enzymes involved in the remodelling of ECM proteins, and noted that the proteoglycanase ADAMTS5 was upregulated in IgAN kidneys. ADAMTS5 accumulated in areas of inflammation, and ADAMTS5+ cells were seen in the tubulointerstitium and glomeruli. The enzyme was expressed by CD64+ cells and its expression was increased by IL-1 and LPS. Analysis of myeloid cell transcriptomics revealed that ADAMTS5 is enriched in human classical monocytes. ADAMTS5+ cells were present in areas of matrix remodelling and associated with ECM proteins lumican, versican, and collagen-4. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry proteomics of kidney explants digested with ADAMTS5, identified multiple kidney proteins affected by ADAMTS5 and revealed specific proteolysis of complement C3 and fibronectin associated with IgA on immune complexes. ADAMTS5 processing of immune complex proteins reduced binding to cultured mesangial cells. ADAMTS5 is associated with interstitial inflammatory cells in IgAN and other kidney lesions and fragments relevant extracellular proteins. The proteolytic enzyme might be a new translational target relevant to inflammation and scarring in kidney disease.","Taylor, Scott; Whitfield, Molly; Barratt, Jonathan; Didangelos, Athanasios",Journal of immunology,565,15

RECENT FINDINGS Large cohort data are mostly based on deconvolution of transcriptional databases. Studies focusing on infiltrate localization often entail small cohorts, a mixture of HNSCC subsites, or focus on a single immune marker rather than the interaction between cells within the TME. Conclusions on the prognostic impact of specific immune cells in HNSCC are hampered by the use of heterogeneous or small cohorts. To move forward, the field should focus on deciphering the immune composition per HNSCC subsite, in powered cohorts and considering the molecular diversity in this disease.","Wondergem, Niels E; Nauta, Irene H; Muijlwijk, Tara; Leemans, C René; van de Ven, Rieneke",Current oncology reports,565,1

Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7%), followed by lung (11.4%), colorectal (10.0 %), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (5.6%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18%), followed by colorectal (9.4%), liver (8.3%), stomach (7.7%), and female breast (6.9%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2-fold to 3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied <2-fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64% to 95%) versus transitioned (32% to 56%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.","Sung, Hyuna; Ferlay, Jacques; Siegel, Rebecca L; Laversanne, Mathieu; Soerjomataram, Isabelle; Jemal, Ahmedin; Bray, Freddie",CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,565,25

The aim of this study was to estimate the association between RWMA after exercise and in the presence of significant AR in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or volume overload and to predict the eventual need for aortic valve replacement (AVR). METHODS AND RESULTS We retrospectively reviewed 182 patients with significant AR who underwent exercise echocardiography. In addition, we investigated patients with AR who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) or coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and were diagnosed with CAD. The presence of RWMA after exercise was defined as newly developed RWMA after exercise and included all changes in wall motion. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of RWMA after exercise: the RWMA group (n = 42) and non-RWMA group (n = 140). In the RWMA group, 31 patients (73.8%) underwent coronary artery evaluation by CAG or CCTA. Only two patients in the RWMA group were diagnosed with current CAD and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients with RWMA were older (61.6 ± 10.8 vs 52.0 ± 13.7 years, P < .001), had more severe AR (54.8% vs 32.9%), and underwent AVR more frequently (40.5% vs 14.3%, P = .001) than patients without RWMA. METs (odds ratio [OR], 0.796; P = .019), difference between rest and postexercise left ventricular end-diastolic volume (OR, 0.967; P = .001), and the difference between pre- and postexercise left ventricular end-systolic volume (OR, 1.113; P < .001) were identified as independent factors associated with RWMA after exercise according to multivariable logistic regression analysis. The majority of wall motion changes were seen in the lateral and inferior segments, and the locations of wall motion changes were relatively consistent with the direction of the AR jet. The relationship between RWMA after exercise and time to AVR was investigated by simple linear regression (hazard ratio [HR], 3.402; P < .001). After adjusting for baseline parameters of diastolic blood pressure, left ventricular end-systolic dimension (LVESD), aorta size, deceleration time, and METs, the presence of RWMA after exercise was not predictive of time to AVR (HR, 1.106; P = .81). On the other hand, without forcible entry of RWMA after exercise, LVESD (HR, 1.119; P < .001) and METs (HR, 0.828; P = .006) independently predicted the eventual need for AVR as an outcome. CONCLUSION The degree of change in wall motion from rest to exercise in those with significant AR was not correlated with CAD, but was correlated with the severity of volume overload and exercise-induced preload changes, as well as the direction of the AR jet. In addition, RWMA after exercise had no role in predicting the need for AVR.","Hwang, Ji-Won; Park, Sung-Ji; Kim, Eun Kyoung; Chang, Sung-A; Choi, Jin-Oh; Lee, Sang-Chol; Ahn, Joong Hyun; Carriere, Keumhee; Park, Seung Woo",Echocardiography,565,1

METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 3 to 12 April 2020. The health belief model (HBM) was used to assess predictors of the intent to receive the vaccine and the WTP. RESULTS A total of 1,159 complete responses was received. The majority reported a definite intent to receive the vaccine (48.2%), followed by a probable intent (29.8%) and a possible intent (16.3%). Both items under the perceived benefits construct in the HBM, namely believe the vaccination decreases the chance of infection (OR = 2.51, 95% CI 1.19-5.26) and the vaccination makes them feel less worry (OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.03-4.65), were found to have the highest significant odds of a definite intention to take the vaccine. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) for the amount that participants were willing to pay for a dose of COVID-19 vaccine was MYR$134.0 (SD±79.2) [US$30.66 ± 18.12]. Most of the participants were willing to pay an amount of MYR$100 [US$23] (28.9%) and MYR$50 [US$11.5] (27.2%) for the vaccine. The higher marginal WTP for the vaccine was influenced by no affordability barriers as well as by socio-economic factors, such as higher education levels, professional and managerial occupations and higher incomes. CONCLUSIONS The findings demonstrate the utility of HBM constructs in understanding COVID-19 vaccination intention and WTP.","Wong, Li Ping; Alias, Haridah; Wong, Pooi-Fong; Lee, Hai Yen; AbuBakar, Sazaly",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,565,5

CLINICAL FINDINGS Abdominal radiography and ultrasonography revealed that calculi and a nonpatent stricture obstructed the right ureter, which resulted in secondary dilatation of the ureter proximal to the obstruction and severe hydronephrosis. The left kidney was small and suspected to be failing. Concentrations of BUN and creatinine were elevated. Despite administration of fluids, azotemia persisted. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Surgery was performed. The obstructed right ureter was replaced with a vascularized segment of ileum. Azotemia resolved, and the cat improved with regard to clinical signs. The cat was clinically normal for > 36 months after the surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE An ileal graft can successfully be used as a surgical option for ureteral obstruction in cats.","Brourman, Jeff D",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,565,8

Conventional management for leaks includes invasive reoperation and even gastrointestinal diversion. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to examine our contemporary outcome of using endoscopic esophageal stenting as primary therapy for management of anastomotic leak following minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE). METHODS We reviewed data on 11 patients who developed an esophageal leak following 111 MIE between January 2011 and December 2019. Of the 11 anastomotic leaks, 10 patients had an anastomotic disruption and underwent endoscopic esophageal stenting as primary therapy for management of leaks, while 1 patient had an anastomotic disruption complicated by an associated tracheoesophageal fistula that required surgical reoperation and subsequent colonic interposition. Main outcome measures focused on the 10 patients who were managed with endoscopic stenting, including length of hospital stay following leak management, need for thoracotomy or gastrointestinal diversion for leak, stent complications, and leak-associated mortality. RESULTS Of the 10 patients who underwent endoscopic esophageal stenting as primary therapy for management of leaks, there were 8 males with a median age of 66 years. The median time to diagnosis of anastomotic leak was 10 days postoperatively. One of the ten patients also underwent percutaneous drain placement, while none of the patients required thoracotomy. Median duration of stent placement was 39 (range, 29-105) days. Median length of stay after stent placement was 10 (range, 4-43) days. The median number of stent exchange was 1 (range, 1-3) stent. Gastrointestinal continuity was maintained in all patients. The 90-day leak-associated mortality was 9.1% (1 of 11 patients). CONCLUSIONS Endoscopic stenting is an effective primary therapy in the management of postesophagectomy leak and avoids the need for an invasive, reoperative thoracotomy or gastrointestinal diversion procedure.","Smith, Ellyn A; Daly, Shaun C; Smith, Brian; Hinojosa, Marcelo; Nguyen, Ninh T",The American surgeon,565,16

METHODS A multi-institutional robotic surgical consortium consisting of five board-certified gynecologist oncologist in distinct geographical regions of the United States was created to evaluate the utility of robotics for gynecologic surgery (benign and malignant). Between April 2003 and August 2008, a total of 835 patients underwent robotic surgery for benign gynecologic disorders and/or gynecologic malignancies by a surgeon in the consortium. IRB approval was obtained and data was collected in a prospective fashion at each institution. For the purposes of the study, a multi-institutional HIPPA compliant database was then created for all patients that underwent robotic-assisted surgery between the April 2003 and August 2008. This database was queried for all patients who underwent a robotic-assisted type II or III radical hysterectomy for Stage IA1 (+vsi)-IB2 cervical carcinoma. Forty-two patients were identified. Records were then reviewed for demographic data, medical conditions, prior abdominal or pelvic surgeries, and follow-up. The perioperative outcomes analyzed included: operative time (skin-skin), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of hospital stay, total lymph node count, conversion to laparotomy, and operative complications. RESULTS From a database of 835 patients who underwent robotic surgery by a gynecologic oncologist, a total of 42 patients who underwent a robotic-assisted type II (n=10) or type III (n=32) radical hysterectomy for early stage cervical cancer were identified. Demographic data demonstrated a median age of 41 and a median BMI of 25.1. With regard to stage, seven patients (17%) were Stage IA2, twenty-eight patients (67%) were Stage IB1 and six patients (14%) were Stage IB2. There was a single patient with Stage IA1 cervical cancer with vascular space invasion who underwent a type II radical hysterectomy. The overall median operative time was 215 min. The overall median estimated blood loss was 50 cc. No patient received a blood transfusion. The median lymph node count was 25. The median hospital stay was 1 day. Positive lymph nodes were detected in 12% of the patients. Pelvic radiotherapy or chemo-radiation was given to 14% of the patients based on final surgical pathology. Intraoperative complications occurred in 4.8% of the patients and included one conversion to laparotomy (2.4%) and one ureteral injury (2.4%). Postoperative complications were reported in 12% of the patients and included a DVT (2.4%), infection (7.2%), and bladder/urinary tract complication (2.4%) The conversion rate to laparotomy was 2.4%. CONCLUSIONS Robotic-assisted radical hysterectomy is associated with minimal blood loss, a shortened hospital stay, and few operative complications. Operative time and lymph node yields are acceptable. This data suggests that robotic-assisted radical hysterectomy may offer an alternative to traditional radical hysterectomy. This series contributes to the growing literature on robotic-assisted radical hysterectomy and prospective comparisons with traditional radical hysterectomy are needed.","Lowe, M Patrick; Chamberlain, Donald H; Kamelle, Scott A; Johnson, Peter R; Tillmanns, Todd D",Gynecologic oncology,565,30

The transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) is said to better preserve pelvic autonomic nerves. The aim of this study was to investigate the nerve identification rates during TaTME by transanal visual and electrophysiological assessment. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 52 patients underwent TaTME for malignant conditions. The IRP with its posterior branches to the IAS and the pelvic splanchnic nerves (PSN) were visually assessed in 20 patients (v-TaTME). Electrophysiological nerve identification was performed in 32 patients using electric stimulation under processed electromyography of IAS (e-TaTME). RESULTS The indication profile for TaTME was comparable between the v-TaTME and the e-TaTME group. The identification of IRP was more meaningful under electrophysiological assessment than under visual assessment for the left pelvic side (81% vs. 45%, p = 0.008) as well as the right pelvic side (78% vs. 45%, p = 0.016). The identification rates for PSN did not significantly differ between both groups, respectively (81% vs. 75%, p = 0.420 and 84% vs. 70%, p = 0.187). CONCLUSIONS The transanal approach facilitated visual identification of IAS nerve supply. In combination with electrophysiological nerve assessment the identification rate almost doubled. For further insights functional data are needed.","Kneist, Werner; Hanke, Laura; Kauff, Daniel W; Lang, Hauke",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,565,1

Stress-mediated changes in translational output cover a broad spectrum of potential responses, including an overall decrease in translation or an increase in the translation of specific mRNAs. Many of these changes involve post-translational modifications of components of the translational machinery. The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway is a critical regulator of growth and translation in response to a wide variety of signals, including growth factors, amino acids and energy availability. Through its kinase activity, mTOR activation results in the phosphorylation of translational components and an increase in translation. As stress-mediated changes in translational output are context-dependent, the interplay between stress and mTOR in the control of translation is also likely to depend on factors such as the strength and type of incident stress. In the present paper, we review mTOR-dependent and -independent translational responses, and discuss their regulation by stress.","Cully, Megan; Downward, Julian",Biochemical Society transactions,565,31

However, the inconsistent appearances and high complexities of various lesions in chest X-rays currently hinder the development of a reliable and robust intelligent diagnosis system. Attending to the high-probability abnormal regions and exploiting the priori of a related knowledge graph offers one promising route to addressing these issues. As such, in this paper, we propose two contrastive abnormal attention models and a dual-weighting graph convolution to improve the performance of thoracic multi-disease recognition. First, a left-right lung contrastive network is designed to learn intra-attentive abnormal features to better identify the most common thoracic diseases, whose lesions rarely appear in both sides symmetrically. Moreover, an inter-contrastive abnormal attention model aims to compare the query scan with multiple anchor scans without lesions to compute the abnormal attention map. Once the intra- and inter-contrastive attentions are weighted over the features, in addition to the basic visual spatial convolution, a chest radiology graph is constructed for dual-weighting graph reasoning. Extensive experiments on the public NIH ChestX-ray and CheXpert datasets show that our model achieves consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art methods both on thoracic disease identification and localization.","Zhou, Yi; Zhou, Tianfei; Zhou, Tao; Fu, Huazhu; Liu, Jiacheng; Shao, Ling",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,565,23

To determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic affected e-cigarette use among young people in the United States.Methods. Data came from a weekly cross-sectional online survey of youths and young adults (aged 15-24 years). Logistic regression analyses measured odds of past-30-day e-cigarette use (n = 5752) following widespread stay-at-home directives (March 14-June 29, 2020), compared with the pre‒COVID-19 period (January 1-March 13, 2020). Logistic regression among a subsample of current e-cigarette users (n = 779) examined factors associated with reduced use following stay-at-home orders.Results. Odds of current e-cigarette use were significantly lower during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the pre‒COVID-19 period among youths aged 15 to 17 years (odds ratio [OR] = 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.54, 0.96) and young adults aged 18 to 20 years (OR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.52, 0.81). E-cigarette users with reduced access to retail environments had higher odds of reporting reduced e-cigarette use (OR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.07, 2.14).Conclusions. COVID-19 stay-at-home directives present barriers to e-cigarette access and are associated with a decline in e-cigarette use among young people.Public Health Implications. Findings support the urgent implementation of interventions that reduce underage access to e-cigarettes to accelerate a downward trajectory of youth and young adult e-cigarette use.

The swiftly growing population of people living with diabetes in Ethiopia and lack of elaborated scientific data on peripheral sensory neuropathy among diabetic population in Ethiopia prompted this work. This study was set out to assess the enormity and associated factors of peripheral sensory neuropathy among diabetes patients attending chronic illness clinic of Felege Hiwot Regional Referral Hospital, Bahr Dar, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS An institution based cross-sectional study was conducted at Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital chronic illness clinic using Michigan neuropathy screening instrument tool for diabetic peripheral sensory neuropathy on 408 diabetic patients during 2016. Data were collected using interview, patient record review, anthropometric measurements and physical examination. Both bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression was employed to identify factors associated with peripheral sensory neuropathy.

Governments have taken public health protection measures to reduce the spread of the virus through non-pharmalogical measures. The impact of the pandemic and the public health response on individual and population mental health is unknown. Methods: We used Google Trends data (1 Jan 2020 - 30 Mar 2020) to investigate the impact of the pandemic and government measures to curb it on people's concerns, as indexed by changes in search frequency for topics indicating mental distress, social and economic stressors and mental health treatment-seeking. We explored the changes of key topics in Google trends in Italy, Spain, USA, UK, and Worldwide in relation to sentinel events during the pandemic. Results: Globally there appears to be significant concerns over the financial and work-related consequences of the pandemic, with some evidence that levels of fear are rising. Conversely relative searching for topics related to depression and suicide fell after the pandemic was announced, with some evidence that searches for the latter have risen recently. Concerns over education and access to medication appear to be particular social stressors. Whilst searches for face-to-face treatments have declined, those for self-care have risen. Conclusions: Monitoring Google trends shows promise as a means of tracking changing public concerns. In weeks to come it may enable policy makers to assess the impact of their interventions including those aiming to limit negative consequences, such as government funded financial safety nets.","Knipe, Duleeka; Evans, Hannah; Marchant, Amanda; Gunnell, David; John, Ann",Wellcome open research,565,19

Both types of viruses translate their genetic information into polyprotein precursors that are processed by virally encoded 3C proteases (3C(pro)) and 3C-like proteases (3CL(pro)), respectively, to generate functional viral proteins. The most studied human rhinoviruses (HRV) belonging to picornaviridae family are the main etiologic agents of the common cold. Due to lack of effective drugs, 3C(pro) has served as an excellent target for anti-viral intervention and considerable efforts have been made in the development of inhibitors. Interestingly, the inhibitors of 3C(pro) cannot inhibit 3CL(pro) potently without modification due to subtle differences in their active-site structures, but a group of common inhibitors against 3C(pro) and 3CL(pro) were found recently. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW The inhibitors against 3C(pro) reported in the literatures and patents, with a focus on those inhibiting HRV and the dual picornaviral 3C(pro)/coronaviral 3CL(pro) inhibitors, are summarized in this review. WHAT THE READERS WILL GAIN Readers will rapidly gain an overview of the individual and dual 3C(pro) inhibitors and the structural basis for discriminating them.

National registries are an important strategy to characterise service delivery, quality and outcomes, yet the number, type and components of national cardiac rehabilitation registries have not been reported. Aims To identify and describe national and international cardiac rehabilitation registries, and summarise their key features. Methods We systematically reviewed the literature reporting on cardiac rehabilitation registries at a national and international level. A search of four databases was conducted in July 2016, with two reviewers independently screening titles/abstracts and full texts for inclusion. Data were extracted from included studies, independently checked by a second reviewer and synthesised qualitatively. Results Eleven articles were included in the review comprising seven national registries and one international registry (of 12 European countries) for a total sample of 265,608 patients. Data were most commonly provided to the registry by a web-based application, and included individual-level data (i.e. sociodemographic characteristics, medical history, and clinical measurements). When reported, service-level data most commonly included wait times, programme enrolment and completion. The overarching governance, funding modes (e.g. industry ( n = 2), government ( n = 1)), and incentives for registry participation (e.g. benchmarking, financial reimbursement, or mandatory requirement) varied widely. Conclusion The use of national and international registries for characterising cardiac rehabilitation and providing a benchmark for quality improvement is in its early stages but shows promise for national and global benchmarking.","Poffley, Alison; Thomas, Emma; Grace, Sherry L; Neubeck, Lis; Gallagher, Robyn; Niebauer, Josef; O'Neil, Adrienne",European journal of preventive cardiology,565,7

METHODS A total of 65 ambulatory patients with SLE and 9 healthy controls underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scanning, for quantitative assessment of BBB permeability. Volumetric data were extracted using the VolBrain pipeline. Global cognitive function was evaluated using a screening battery consisting of tasks falling into five broad cognitive domains, and was compared between patients with normal versus extensive BBB leakage. RESULTS Patients with SLE had significantly higher levels of BBB leakage compared with controls (p=0.04). Extensive BBB leakage (affecting over >9% of brain volume) was identified only in patients with SLE (16/65; 24.6%), who also had smaller right and left cerebral grey matter volumes compared with controls (p=0.04). Extensive BBB leakage was associated with lower global cognitive scores (p=0.02), and with the presence of impairment on one or more cognitive tasks (p=0.01). CONCLUSION Our findings provide evidence for a link between extensive BBB leakage and changes in both brain structure and cognitive function in patients with SLE. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms underlying BBB-mediated cognitive impairment, validate the diagnostic utility of BBB imaging, and determine the potential of targeting the BBB as a therapeutic strategy in patients with SLE.","Kamintsky, Lyna; Beyea, Steven D; Fisk, John D; Hashmi, Javeria A; Omisade, Antonina; Calkin, Cynthia; Bardouille, Tim; Bowen, Chris; Quraan, Maher; Mitnitski, Arnold; Matheson, Kara; Friedman, Alon; Hanly, John G",Annals of the rheumatic diseases,565,11

The objective of the current study was to develop a video-based instrument, SARAhome , for measuring ataxia severity easily and independently at home. METHODS Based on feasibility of self-application, we selected 5 SARA items (gait, stance, speech, nose-finger test, fast alternating hand movements) for SARAhome (range, 0-28). We compared SARAhome items with total SARA scores in 526 patients with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, and 6 from the EUROSCA natural history study. To prospectively validate the SARAhome , we directly compared the self-applied SARAhome and the conventional SARA in 50 ataxia patients. To demonstrate feasibility of independent home recordings in a pilot study, 12 ataxia patients were instructed to obtain a video each morning and evening over a period of 14 days. All videos were rated offline by a trained rater. RESULTS SARAhome extracted from the EUROSCA baseline data was highly correlated with conventional SARA (r = 0.9854, P < 0.0001). In the prospective validation study, the SARAhome was highly correlated with the conventional SARA (r = 0.9254, P < 0.0001). Five of 12 participants of the pilot study obtained a complete set of 28 evaluable videos. Seven participants obtained 13-27 videos. The intraindividual differences between the lowest and highest SARAhome scores ranged from 1 to 5.5. CONCLUSION The SARAhome and the conventional SARA are highly correlated.

Changes in instrument configuration may increase task complexity and therefore affect tissue handling skills. The aim of this study is to determine if a relation exists between instrument configuration and tissue interaction force. A study was performed to investigate the differences in manipulation force between a single-port (SP) and 2-port (TP) instrument configuration in a standard box trainer. A force platform was placed under a tissue manipulation task in a box trainer and used to measure the pulling forces and trial time. A total of 28 medical students with no previous experience in laparoscopic surgery were divided into 2 equal groups. Group 1 trained the task 6 times with the TP configuration and subsequently performed 6 trials with the SP configuration. Group 2 used the configurations in the opposite order. For both groups, the learning curves of the maximum force and task time were compared. Time and maximum pulling forces were significantly different between the 2 instrument configurations. In both groups, the participants used significantly more force in the SP configuration than in the TP configuration. The force data indicate that the increased complexity in instrument handling with straight instruments in a SP configuration increases the tissue manipulation force. Furthermore, the tissue handling skills of novices who mastered the task with the TP configuration decreased after switching to the SP configuration.","Horeman, Tim; Kurteva D D Kurteva, Desislava Dimitrova; Valdastri, Piedro; Jansen, Frank Willem; van den Dobbelsteen, John J; Dankelman, Jenny",Surgical innovation,565,12

DESIGN AND SETTING Site visits to 24 long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in Fulton County, Georgia, were conducted between June and July 2020 to assess adherence to current guidelines, provide real-time feedback on potential weaknesses, and identify specific indicators whose implementation or lack thereof was associated with higher or lower prevalence of COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS Twenty-four LTCFs were visited, representing 2,580 LTCF residents, among whom 1,004 (39%) were infected with COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS Overall IPC adherence in LTCFs was analyzed for 33 key indicators across five categories: Hand Hygiene, Disinfection, Social Distancing, PPE, and Symptom Screening. Facilities were divided into Higher- and Lower-prevalence groups based on cumulative COVID-19 infection prevalence to determine differences in IPC implementation. RESULTS IPC implementation was lowest in the Disinfection category (32%) and highest in the Symptom Screening category (74%). Significant differences in IPC implementation between the Higher- and Lower-prevalence groups were observed in the Social Distancing category (Higher-prevalence group 54% vs. Lower-prevalence group 74%, p<0.01) and the PPE category (Higher-prevalence group 41% vs. Lower-prevalence group 72%, p<0.01). CONCLUSION LTCFs with lower COVID-19 prevalence among residents had significantly greater implementation of IPC recommendations compared to those with higher COVID-19 prevalence, suggesting the utility in adhering to current guidelines to reduce transmission in this vulnerable population.

Objectives The aim of present study was to assess the Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) of dental practitioners in Kolkata city, West Bengal, India regarding COVID-2019 pandemic. Materials and method Online questionnaire was distributed among dentists across West Bengal city, using a combination of convenience and snowball sampling. The questionnaire had 17 questions: (1) Section A was 'General section' which comprised of socio-demographic and professional details of the subjects; and (2) Section B comprised of 14 questions depicting knowledge, awareness attitude and practice regarding COVID-19. The data collected was subjected to statistical analysis with level of significance at p=0.05. The descriptive statistical analysis was done to compute frequency and percentages. Intergroup comparison was determined by Chi-square statistical analysis to determine the level of significance for responses of each question. Results Around 70.4% undergraduates participated in the study. Only 4.3% showed accurate knowledge with respect to the incubation period of coronavirus. Coughing and sneezing was considered to be the most common mode of transmission. 98.9% of dentists considered fever to be the characteristic symptom of the disease. Hand washing and alcohol rubs was advocated by 99.5% of the dentist. Emergency procedures were considered necessary by 90.8% dentists. 75.1% of dentists agree that their practice has been affected by the pandemic. Conclusion A constant update regarding COVID-19 should be made available to dental health care professionals through webinars, seminars, discussions and articles. Dentists should keep themselves updated and help to fight against this pandemic.","Bera, Ritwika; Kalia, Preeti; Hiremath, Shilpa; Jaiswal, Deepesh",Roczniki Panstwowego Zakladu Higieny,565,8

This has created a demand for a substance whose effectiveness has already been demonstrated in a similar scenario. Glycyrrhizin (GZ) is a promising agent against SARS-CoV-2 as its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV has already been confirmed. It is worthwhile to extrapolate from its proven therapeutic effects as there is a high similarity in the structure and genome of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. There are many possible mechanisms through which GZ acts against viruses: increasing nitrous oxide production in macrophages, affecting transcription factors and cellular signalling pathways, directly altering the viral lipid-bilayer membrane, and binding to the ACE2 receptor. In this review, we discuss the possible use of GZ in the COVID-19 setting, where topical administration appears to be promising, with the nasal and oral cavity notably being the potent location in terms of viral load. The most recently published papers on the distribution of ACE2 in the human body and documented binding of GZ to this receptor, as well as its antiviral activity, suggest that GZ can be used as a therapeutic for COVID-19 and as a preventive agent against SARS-CoV-2.","Chrzanowski, Julian; Chrzanowska, Alicja; Graboń, Wojciech",Phytotherapy research : PTR,565,19

This type of heart failure is more common in older people with a history of hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Patients with HFpEF are often managed in primary care, sometimes in collaboration with specialists. Knowledge about how best to manage this growing population is limited, and there is a pressing need to improve care for these patients. AIM To explore clinicians' and patients'/carers' perspectives and experiences about the management of HFpEF to inform the development of an improved model of care. DESIGN AND SETTING A multiperspective qualitative study involving primary and secondary care settings across the east of England, Greater Manchester, and the West Midlands. METHOD Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted. Transcribed data were analysed using framework analysis and informed by the normalisation process theory (NPT). RESULTS In total, 50 patients, nine carers/relatives, and 73 clinicians were recruited. Difficulties with diagnosis, unclear illness perceptions, and management disparity were identified as important factors that may influence management of HFpEF. The NPT construct of coherence reflected what participants expressed about the need to improve the identification, understanding, and awareness of this condition in order to improve care. CONCLUSION There is a pressing need to raise the public and clinical profile of HFpEF, develop a clear set of accepted practices concerning its management, and ensure that systems of care are accessible and attuned to the needs of patients with this condition.","Sowden, Emma; Hossain, Muhammad; Chew-Graham, Carolyn; Blakeman, Tom; Tierney, Stephanie; Wellwood, Ian; Rosa, Francesca; Deaton, Christi",The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,565,9

However, despite this advantage, a large number of attempts are unsuccessful. There are no existing data on anatomic characteristics in critically ill patients associated with a failed first attempt at laryngoscopy when using video laryngoscopy. OBJECTIVES To identify characteristics associated with first-attempt failure at intubation when using video laryngoscopy in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS This is an observational study of 906 consecutive patients intubated in the ICU with a video laryngoscope between January 2012 and January 2016 in a single-center academic medical ICU. After each intubation, the operator completed a data collection form, which included information on difficult airway characteristics, device used, and outcome of each attempt. Multivariable regression models were constructed to determine the difficult airway characteristics associated with a failed first attempt at intubation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS There were no significant differences in sex, age, reason for intubation, or device used between first-attempt failures and first-attempt successes. First-attempt successes more commonly reported no difficult airway characteristics were present (23.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 20.7-27.0% vs. 13.3%; 95% CI, 8.0-18.8%). In logistic regression analysis of the entire 906-patient database, blood in the airway (odds ratio [OR], 2.63; 95% CI, 1.64-4.20), airway edema (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.48-5.45), and obesity (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.08-2.32) were significantly associated with first-attempt failure. Data collection on limited mouth opening and secretions began after the first 133 intubations, and we fit a second logistic model to examine cases in which these additional difficult airway characteristics were collected. In this subset (n = 773), the presence of blood (OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.60-4.64), cervical immobility (OR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.28-8.72), and airway edema (OR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.42-6.70) were associated with first-attempt failure. CONCLUSIONS In this single-center study, presence of blood in the airway, airway edema, cervical immobility, and obesity are associated with higher odds of first-attempt failure, when intubation was performed with video laryngoscopy in an ICU.","Joshi, Raj; Hypes, Cameron D; Greenberg, Jeremy; Snyder, Linda; Malo, Josh; Bloom, John W; Chopra, Harsharon; Sakles, John C; Mosier, Jarrod M",Annals of the American Thoracic Society,565,16

The purpose of this study is to detail the international impact of COVID-19 among otolaryngologists, and to identify instructional cases. METHODS Country representatives of the Young Otolaryngologists - International Federation of Otolaryngologic Societies (YO-IFOS) surveyed otolaryngologists through various channels. Nationwide surveys were distributed in 19 countries. The grey literature and social media channels were searched to identify reported deaths of otolaryngologists from COVID-19. RESULTS A total of 361 otolaryngologists were identified to have had COVID-19, and data for 325 surgeons was available for analysis. The age range was 25 to 84, with half under the age of 44. There were 24 deaths in the study period, with 83% over age 55. Source of infection was likely clinical activity in 175 (54%) cases. Prolonged exposure to a colleague was the source for 37 (11%) surgeons. Six instructional cases were identified where infections occurred during the performance of aerosol-generating operations (tracheostomy, mastoidectomy, epistaxis control, dacryocystorhinostomy and translabyrinthine resection). In three of these cases, multiple operating room attendees were infected, and in two, the surgeon succumbed to complications of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS The etiology of reported cases within the otolaryngology community appear to stem equally from clinical activity and community spread. Multiple procedures performed by otolaryngologists are aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) and great care should be taken to protect the surgical team before, during, and after these operations.

We evaluated the performance characteristics of multiplex NAT assays performed concurrently on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and bronchial wash (BW) specimens to detect respiratory pathogens. A retrospective study of admitted patients from March 2013 through December 2016 was performed. Individual performance characteristics of BAL and BW specimens were compared to positive results from either set of specimens. Only contemporaneous BAL and BW specimens (received by the laboratory within 4 h of each other) were included. The final cohort included 170 patients, with 184 contemporaneous BAL and BW specimens submitted for multiplex NAT (median age, 58 years; 62% male). Of the patients with positive NAT results, 38 of 40 BW specimens tested positive (overall percent agreement with combined testing, 98.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 95.5 to 98.9%), and 34 of 40 BAL specimens tested positive (overall percent agreement with combined testing, 96.7%; 95% CI, 93.0 to 96.7%). Assays performed on BW specimens identified 4 additional specimens and had a higher positive percent agreement (95.0%) with combined testing results compared to those performed on BAL specimens (85.0%). There was exact concordance in 174 specimens (94.6%; negative and positive for respiratory pathogens, 144 and 34 specimens, respectively). We observed high concordance (95%) between multiplex NAT results from contemporaneous BAL and BW specimens. Performance characteristics of BW specimen testing were equivalent to those of BAL specimen testing. The benefit of performing additional testing should be carefully considered against the potential complications and health care costs.","Munigala, Satish; Burnham, C A; Anderson, Neil W; Liang, Stephen Y; Lawrence, Steven J; Warren, David K",Journal of clinical microbiology,565,10

To assess humidification of respiratory gases in patients who underwent moderate therapeutic hypothermia at a paediatric/adult intensive care unit, 6 patients were studied over 9 times. Three humidifier settings, 37-default (chamber-outlet, 37°C; Y-piece, 40°C), 33.5-theoretical (chamber-outlet, 33.5°C; Y-piece, 36.5°C), and 33.5-adjusted (optimised setting to achieve saturated vapour at 33.5°C using feedback from a thermohygrometer), were tested. Y-piece gas temperature/humidity and the incidence of high (>40.6 mg/L) and low (<32.9 mg/L) humidity relative to the target level (36.6 mg/L) were assessed.

We recently reported that the difference between MSFP at zero flow measured by right atrial balloon occlusion (MSFPRAO) and MSFP estimated using inspiratory holds depends on the volume status. We now compare three indirect estimates of MSFP with MSFPRAO in euvolemia, bleeding, and hypervolemia in a model of anesthetized pigs (n = 9) with intact circulation. MSFP was estimated using instantaneous beat-to-beat venous return during tidal ventilation (MSFPinst_VR), right atrial pressure-flow data pairs at flow nadir during inspiratory holds (MSFPnadir_hold), and a dynamic model analog adapted to pigs (MSFPa). MSFPRAO was underestimated by MSFPnadir_hold and MSFPa in all volume states. Volume status modified the difference between MSFPRAO and all indirect methods (method × volume state interaction, P ≤ 0.020). All methods tracked changes in MSFPRAO concordantly, with the lowest bias seen for MSFPa [bias (confidence interval): -0.4 (-0.7 to -0.0) mmHg]. We conclude that indirect estimates of MSFP are unreliable in this experimental setup.

Median patient age was 40 years, and median body mass index was 23. Median operative time was 100 minutes (range, 50-145 minutes) for laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy, 70 minutes (range, 30-150 minutes) for ovarian cystectomy, 107 minutes (range, 65-180 minutes) for myomectomy, 55 minutes (range, 25-130 minutes) for oophorectomy, 85 minutes (range, 35-110 minutes) for salpingectomy, 70 minutes (range, 25-140 minutes) for neosalpingostomy or fimbrioplasty, and 35 minutes (range, 30-60-minutes) for adhesiolysis only. All procedures were completed successfully without the need for additional ports or conversion to the standard laparoscopic approach. One perioperative complication occurred. The complication rate was 83% (1 of 120). Other postoperative complications were not observed at follow-up. CONCLUSION Our experience shows that LESS using conventional laparoscopic instruments and our glove port technique is a feasible and safe technique for the surgical management of various gynecologic conditions. Therefore, our homemade glove port laparoscopic system used in our specialized technique provides a simple, cost-effective approach to LESS and would probably make laparoscopic procedures using conventional instruments easier.","Yang, Yun Seok; Oh, Kwoan Young; Hur, Myung Haeng; Kim, Soo Young; Yim, Hyun Soon",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,565,2

The aim of this study was to identify the common transcriptional profiling and composition of immune cells in peripheral blood in these autoimmune diseases (ADs). METHODS We analysed bulk RNA-seq data for enrichment of biological processes, transcription factors (TFs) and deconvolution-based immune cell types from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 119 treatment-naive patients (41 RA, 38 pSS, 28 SLE and 12 polyautoimmunity) and 20 healthy controls. The single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry had been performed to further define the immune cell subsets on PBMCs. RESULTS Similar transcriptional profiles and common gene expression signatures associated with nucleosome assembly and haemostasis were identified across RA, SLE, pSS and polyautoimmunity. Distinct TF ensembles and gene regulatory network were mainly enriched in haematopoiesis. The upregulated cell-lineage-specific TFs PBX1, GATA1, TAL1 and GFI1B demonstrated a strong gene expression signature of megakaryocyte (MK) expansion. Gene expression-based cell type enrichment revealed elevated MK composition, specifically, CD41b+CD42b+ and CD41b+CD61+ MKs were expanded, further confirmed by flow cytometry in these ADs. In scRNA-seq data, MKs were defined by TFs PBX1/GATA1/TAL1 and pre-T-cell antigen receptor gene, PTCRA. Cellular heterogeneity and a distinct immune subpopulation with functional enrichment of antigen presentation were observed in MKs. CONCLUSIONS The identification of MK expansion provided new insights into the peripheral immune cell atlas across RA, SLE, pSS and polyautoimmunity. Aberrant regulation of the MK expansion might contribute to the pathogenesis of these ADs.","Wang, Yukai; Xie, Xuezhen; Zhang, Chengpeng; Su, Miaotong; Gao, Sini; Wang, Jing; Lu, Changhao; Lin, Qisheng; Lin, Jianqun; Matucci-Cerinic, Marco; Furst, Daniel E; Zhang, Guohong",Annals of the rheumatic diseases,565,1

Research has increasingly investigated how individual characteristics and contextual factors affect parents' negative discipline. The present study was aimed to explain the association between parental neuroticism and negative discipline by examining the mediating role of household chaos and the moderating role of parental cognitive perspective taking. In a longitudinal design, the study assessed parents' self-report of negative discipline at two time points 1 year apart. One hundred and thirty-four parents of children aged 4-7 years were recruited in Hong Kong. Data were analyzed using Bayesian estimation. The findings revealed that parent-rated household chaos mediated the association between parental neuroticism and negative discipline. Parental perspective taking alleviated the mediational pathway but not the directional association. Specifically, when parents displayed a higher level of cognitive perspective taking, the indirect association between parental neuroticism and negative discipline was no longer significant. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings for negative discipline were discussed.

Trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) is an overall safe option with an immediate impact on neonatal and maternal short- and long-term health. Since the use of prostaglandins in cervical ripening is associated with an increased risk of uterine rupture, mechanical methods as balloon catheters or osmotic dilators have been suggested for cervical ripening prior to induction of labour. Here we are analyzing and comparing the VBAC rate, as well as maternal and fetal outcome in cervical ripening prior to TOLAC. METHODS This prospective dual center study analyses maternal and neonatal outcomes of TOLAC in women with an unfavorable cervix requiring cervical ripening agent. The prospective application of an osmotic dilator (Dilapan-S, n=104) was analysed in comparison to the retrospective application of off-label dinoprostone (n=102). RESULTS The overall fetal and neonatal outcome revealed no significant differences in both groups. Patients receiving cervical ripening with the osmotic dilator delivered vaginally/by ventouse in 52% of cases, compared to 53% when using dinoprostone (p=0.603). The interval between application to onset of labor was significantly higher in the osmotic dilator group (37.9 vs.20.7 h, p=<0.001). However, time from onset of labor to delivery was similar in both groups (7.93 vs. 7.44 h, p=0.758). There was one case of uterine rupture in the dinoprostone group. CONCLUSIONS Our data shows that the application of the osmotic dilator leads to similar outcomes in VBAC rate and time from onset of labor to delivery as well as safety in both groups compared to off-label use dinoprostone. Cervical ripening using the mechanical dilator is a viable and effective option, without the risk of uterine hyperstimulation.","Koenigbauer, Josefine Theresia; Schalinski, Elisabeth; Jarchau, Ute; Gauger, Ulrich; Brandt, Katrin; Klaucke, Sandra; Scharf, Jens-Peter; Rath, Werner; Hellmeyer, Lars",Journal of perinatal medicine,565,29

The aim of this study was to explore general practice's ability to deliver the national influenza vaccination program in high-risk adult populations. METHOD The study was a qualitative inquiry framed by the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation model of behaviour change (COM-B model) using semi-structured interviews and content analysis. RESULTS Six general practitioners and eight practice nurses were recruited from diverse locations across Australia. Participants generally reported having the capability, opportunity and motivation to effectively deliver influenza vaccination to high-risk adults. Perceived barriers included time pressures, complexity of patient consultations, difficulty reaching high-risk younger adults, issues related to optimal timing of influenza vaccination, inconsistent vaccine supply and pharmacist involvement in vaccination. DISCUSSION Making influenza vaccination recommendations a 'whole-of-practice' staff responsibility can address some challenges. Clear and consistent messaging about the importance and optimal timing of influenza vaccination, and a more efficient vaccine supply chain, would support influenza vaccination in general practice.","Randall, Sue; Williams, Anna; Seale, Holly; Beard, Frank",Australian journal of general practice,565,16

A recent randomized controlled trial showed that preterm infants [gestational age (GA) < 30 weeks] stabilized with an initial high FiO2 (1.0) had a significantly higher breathing effort than infants stabilized with a low FiO2 (0.3). As the diaphragm is the main respiratory muscle in these infants, we aimed to describe the effects of the initial FiO2 on diaphragm activity. Methods: In a subgroup of infants from the original bi-center randomized controlled trial diaphragm activity was measured with transcutaneous electromyography of the diaphragm (dEMG), using three skin electrodes that were placed directly after birth. Diaphragm activity was compared in the first 5 min after birth. From the dEMG respiratory waveform several outcome measures were determined for comparison of the groups: average peak- and tonic inspiratory activity (dEMGpeak and dEMGton, respectively), inspiratory amplitude (dEMGamp), area under the curve (dEMGAUC) and the respiratory rate (RR). Results: Thirty-one infants were included in this subgroup, of which 29 could be analyzed [n = 15 (median GA 28.4 weeks) and n = 14 (median GA 27.9 weeks) for the 100 and 30% oxygen group, respectively]. Tonic diaphragm activity was significantly higher in the high FiO2-group (4.3 ± 2.1 μV vs. 2.9 ± 1.1 μV; p = 0.047). The other dEMG-parameters (dEMGpeak, dEMGamp, dEMGAUC) showed consistently higher values in the high FiO2 group, but did not reach statistical significance. Average RR showed similar values in both groups (34 ± 9 vs. 32 ± 10 breaths/min for the high and low oxygen group, respectively). Conclusion: Preterm infants stabilized with an initial high FiO2 showed significantly more tonic diaphragm activity and an overall trend toward a higher level of diaphragm activity than those stabilized with an initial low FiO2. These results confirm that a high initial FiO2 after birth stimulates breathing effort, which can be objectified with dEMG.","van Leuteren, Ruud W; Scholten, Anouk W J; Dekker, Janneke; Martherus, Tessa; de Jongh, Frans H; van Kaam, Anton H; Te Pas, Arjan B; Hutten, Jeroen",Frontiers in pediatrics,565,19

However, postprandial symptoms can compromise its beneficial effect. It is not known if a changed gastric emptying and these symptoms are related. This study aimed to assess the association between postprandial symptoms and the gastric emptying pattern after LSG. METHODS A gastric emptying study with a solid and liquid meal component was performed in the second year after LSG. Before the test, symptoms were assessed using a standardized questionnaire, and during the test, symptoms were scored on a visual analog scale (VAS). Gastric emptying results were expressed as lag phase, half time of gastric emptying (T½), and caloric emptying rate/minute. RESULTS Twenty patients (14 F/6 M; age 45.6 ± 7.7 years, weight 93.4 ± 28.2 kg, BMI 31.6 ± 8.1 kg/m(2)) participated in this study; 13 had a low symptom score (≤9, group I), 7 a high symptom score (≥18, group II). VAS scores for epigastric pain, nausea, and belching were significantly higher in group II. Lag phase (solid) was 6.4 ± 4.5 min in group I, 7.3 ± 6.3 in group II (p = 0.94); T½ (solid) was 40.6 ± 10.0 min in group I, 34.4 ± 9.3 in group II (p = 0.27); caloric emptying rate was 3.9 ± 0.6 kcal/min in group I, 3.9 ± 1.0 kcal/min in group II (p = 0.32). CONCLUSIONS Patients with postprandial symptoms after LSG reported more symptoms during the gastric emptying study than patients without symptoms. However, there was no difference between gastric emptying characteristics between both groups, suggesting that abnormal gastric emptying is not a major determinant of postprandial symptoms after LSG.","Burgerhart, Jan S; van Rutte, Pim W J; Edelbroek, Michela A L; Wyndaele, Dirk N J; Smulders, Johannes F; van de Meeberg, Paul C; Siersema, Peter D; Smout, André J P M",Obesity surgery,565,22

METHODS Patients with mid-low locally advanced rectal cancer (T3 category or above and/or N+) who underwent rectal resection with TaTME technique were enrolled prospectively. Patients who had distant metastasis, multiple malignancies, intestinal obstruction or perforation, or a clinical complete response to chemoradiotherapy were excluded. Postoperative results, including morbidity, circumferential resection margin (CRM) assessment, short-term survival and functional outcomes, were analysed. RESULTS Thirty-eight patients, with 25 mid and 13 low rectal tumours, who had elective resection by TaTME from March 2015 to September 2018 were included. There were 25 men and 13 women. Mean(s.d.) age was 58·2(16·4) years and mean(s.d.) BMI was 24·2(2·5) kg/m2 . Tumours were 3-9 cm from the anal verge. Mean(s.d.) duration of surgery was 210(42) min. All patients had hand-sewn anastomoses and protective ileostomies. There were no conversions, abdominal perineal resections or postoperative deaths. Four patients had a complication, including three presacral abscesses, all managed by transanastomotic drainage. At 3 months after ileostomy closure, all patients had perfect continence. Apart from a greater tumour diameter in patients with low rectal cancers (6·0 cm versus 4·6 cm in those with mid rectal tumours; P = 0·035), clinical features were similar in the two groups. CRM positivity was greater for low than for mid rectal tumours (3 of 13 versus 0 of 25 respectively; P = 0·034), and more patients with a low tumour had TME grade 2 (4 of 13 versus 1 of 25; P = 0·038). There was no difference in oncological outcomes at 17 months. CONCLUSION Although this study cohort was small, special attention should be paid to bulky low rectal tumours to reduce the rate of CRM positivity.","Thien, H H; Hiep, P N; Thanh, P H; Xuan, N T; Trung, T N; Vy, P T; Dong, P X; Hieu, M T; Son, N H",BJS open,565,1

The incidence of COVID-19 has markedly reduced since a peak in mid-March. There have been no cases reported in SA, the NT or the ACT in the last four weeks. The numbers of new cases reported from other jurisdictions continue to be very low. Testing rates have been higher across all jurisdictions, with Victoria reporting an 85% testing rate increase and NSW a 40% increase over this period. The positivity rate nationally continues to remain very low at less than 0.1% over the reporting period. Continued high rates of testing are necessary to detect and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the community. Over the past fortnight, 45% of cases acquired their infection overseas. Of cases considered to be locally acquired over this period, most were associated with contacts of confirmed cases or were associated with known outbreaks. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 65-79 years. Three-quarters of all cases in this age group have been associated with overseas travel, including several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in children under 18, a pattern reflected in international reports. A small proportion of cases overall have experienced severe disease, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care with some fatalities. The crude case fatality rate amongst Australian cases is 1.4%. People who are older and have one or more comorbidities are more likely to experience severe disease. A combination of early case identification, physical distancing, public health measures and a reduction in international travel have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease in Australia. In addition, the median number of days between symptom onset and diagnostic testing has improved considerably from 7 days in the early phase of the outbreak to 1 day in the latest phase of the epidemic. Internationally, as at 24 May 2020, there have been recent increases in the number of daily cases reported globally. The largest numbers of both cases and deaths have been reported in the United States. Of the confirmed cases reported globally, the case fatality rate is approximately 6.5%. Countries in South America are starting to see rapid acceleration, while the United States is seeing a very slow decline in its daily new case numbers.

The aims of this study were to identify key food system drivers influencing the Australian packaged food sector and analyse how these might impact the willingness of food companies to voluntarily reduce salt in packaged foods. METHODS Business methods formed the basis of this retrospective applied policy analysis of voluntary salt reduction for the period 2013-2016 where the focal policy was the Australian Food and Health Dialogue (2009-2015). The analytical framework included political-legal, economic, social, technological (PEST) external drivers of the food system, and Porter's Five Forces for the competitive drivers of the food system. Documentary data identifying food system drivers affecting the Australian packaged food sector (comprised of the food processing and supermarket industries) were identified through a comprehensive search of the grey and academic literatures. RESULTS The interplay between external and competitive food system drivers created an environment in which voluntary salt reduction was found to be an uneasy fit. A high cost of doing business, soft growth, intense competition, asymmetry of power in favour of supermarkets, and marginal consumer interest in less salty food were found likely to create commercial disincentives to invest in voluntary salt reduction above more pressing commercial imperatives. Analysis of food manufacturing industries highlighted the highly contextual nature of food system drivers. Opportunities for nutrition policy included: support for 'shared value' in economic discourse; and, leveraging investor, supermarket, and the largely unrealised bargaining power of consumers. CONCLUSION Business frameworks can provide meaningful insights for nutrition policy on how food system drivers can thwart policy goals. Our analysis highlighted areas to incentivise voluntary action and illustrated the importance of political-legal, economic and consumer strategies for salt reduction.","Trevena, Helen; Neal, Bruce; Downs, Shauna M; Davis, Teresa; Sacks, Gary; Crino, Michelle; Thow, Anne Marie",International journal of health policy and management,565,20

We sought to assess whether a mandatory gloving policy reduced the risk of other health care-acquired infections (HAIs). METHODS This retrospective cohort study included all patients admitted to pediatric units of a tertiary care center between 2002 and 2010. Poisson regression models were used to measure the association between mandatory gloving and HAI incidence. Autoregressive models were used to adjust for time correlation. RESULTS During the study period, 686 HAIs occurred during 363 782 patient-days. The risk of any HAI was 25% lower during mandatory gloving periods compared with during nongloving periods (relative risk [RR]: 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.93; P = .01), after adjusting for long-term trends and seasonal effect. Mandatory gloving was associated with lower risks of bloodstream infections (RR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.49-0.81; P < .001), central line-associated bloodstream infections (RR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.44-0.84; P = 0.003), and hospital-acquired pneumonia (RR: 0.20; 95% CI: 0.03-1.25; P= 0.09).

KEY RESULTS Quality measure performance was an incentive in 22% of visits; patient experience scores, 17%; individual productivity, 57%; practice financial performance, 63%; and practice efficiency, 12%. In adjusted models, none of the compensation incentives were consistently associated with individual high- and low-value measures. None of the compensation incentives were associated with high- or low-value care composites. For example, quality measure performance compensation was not significantly associated with high-value care (visits with quality incentive, 47% of eligible measures met; without quality incentive, 43%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.15) or low-value care (aOR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.82-1.19).

Evaluar un método de amplificación isotérmica para la detección rápida del hRSV en niños con infección respiratoria aguda. Materiales y métodos. Se extrajo el ARN viral de 304 muestras de hisopado nasal en niños con síntomas de infección respiratoria aguda atendidos en el servicio de urgencias del Hospital de la Universidad del Norte en Barranquilla entre abril del 2016 y julio del 2017. Se evaluó la prueba de amplificación isotérmica mediada por bucle mediante transcriptasa inversa de la proteína de la matriz (M) (Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification, RT-LAMP) comparada con técnicas moleculares como la reacción en cadena de la polimerasa mediante transcriptasa inversa múltiple anidada (Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction, RT-PCR), la cual se empleó como la prueba estándar, la PCR en tiempo real (quantitative PCR, qPCR) y la RT-LAMP de la proteína L (L) para la detección rápida del virus sincicial respiratorio (VSR), subtipo A y subtipo B. Resultados. La prueba de RT-LAMP (M) tuvo una sensibilidad de 93,59 %, una especificidad de 92,92 % y una concordancia de 0,83 ± 0,036 comparada con la prueba de RT-PCR anidada. El índice kappa del RT-LAMP (M) fue superior, y los valores del RTLAMP (L) y la qPCR concordaron (0,75 ± 0,043 y 0,71 ± 0,045, respectivamente).","Bettin-Martínez, Alfonso; Villareal-Camacho, José; Cervantes-Acosta, Guillermo; Acosta-Reyes, Jorge; Barbosa, Juliana; San Juan, Homero",Biomedica : revista del Instituto Nacional de Salud,565,1

The epidemiological, clinical, and aetiological data of adult (aged ⩾15 years) acute diarrhoea in a general hospital in Shanghai were collected and analysed. Out of 2430 acute diarrhoea patients, 162 subjects were sampled (sample ratio 15:1). The sampled subjects had an average age (±s.d.) of 44 ± 18 years; 142 (87·7%) had a history that indicated ingestion of contaminated food; and 40 (24·7%), 54 (33·3%), and 73 (45·1%) patients had diarrhoea that was attributed to viral, bacterial, and unknown aetiological origins respectively. Viral diarrhoea is mainly prevalent during the winter and spring months, while bacterial and diarrhoea of unknown aetiology occur mainly in the summer months. The average age of the unknown aetiology group (48 ± 19 years) was significantly older than that of the viral diarrhoea group (39 ± 16 years). The number of patients with vomiting in the viral group (30·6%) was significantly higher than that in the bacterial (17·1%) and unknown aetiology (8·2%) groups. Viral and bacterial infections are the main cause of acute diarrhoea in Shanghai. However, further effective technological means are needed to improve the surveillance, control, and prevention of acute diarrhoea.","Zhao, X; Ni, B; Wang, Y; Shen, X; Zhang, C; Liu, J; Li, S",Epidemiology and infection,565,31

Use of digital diabetes technologies and telehealth protocols within a digital/virtual diabetes clinic (D/VDC) has the potential to address these challenges. However, several issues must be resolved to move forward. In February 2020, organizers of the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) Annual Conference convened an international panel of healthcare professionals, researchers, patient advocates, and industry representatives to review the status of digital diabetes technologies, characterize deficits in current technologies, and identify issues for consideration. Since that meeting, the importance of using telehealth and digital diabetes technologies has been demonstrated amid the global COVID-19 pandemic. This article summarizes the panel's discussion of the opportunities, obstacles and requisites for advancing use of these technologies as a standard of care for the management of diabetes.","Phillip, Moshe; Bergenstal, Richard M; Close, Kelly L; Danne, Thomas; Garg, Satish K; Heinemann, Lutz; Hirsch, Irl B; Kovatchev, Boris P; Laffel, Lori Mb; Mohan, Viswanathan; Parkin, Christopher G; Battelino, Tadej",Diabetes technology & therapeutics,565,1

This paper proposes a data processing method that divides the flow data into data flow segments so that the model can improve the throughput per unit time to meet its detection efficiency. For this kind of data, a malicious traffic detection model with a hierarchical attention mechanism is also proposed and named HAGRU (Hierarchical Attention Gated Recurrent Unit). By fusing the feature information of the three hierarchies, the detection ability of the model is improved. An attention mechanism is introduced to focus on malicious flows in the data flow segment, which can reasonably utilize limited computing resources. Finally, compare the proposed model with the current state of the method on the datasets. The experimental results show that: the novel model performs well in different evaluation indicators (detection rate, false-positive rate, F-score), and it can improve the performance of category recognition with fewer samples when the data is unbalanced. At the same time, the training of the novel model on larger datasets will enhance the generalization ability and reduce the false alarm rate. The proposed model not only improves the performance of malicious traffic detection but also provides a new research method for improving the efficiency of model detection.","Liu, Xiaoyang; Liu, Jiamiao",Scientific reports,565,26

Evidence suggests that bony fixation results in reduced ventilator dependence, a shorter overall hospital stay, and improved upper extremity function. We prefer to accomplish this with autologous tissue alone (such as the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, or rectus abdominus muscle flaps) for small to moderate defects. En bloc resection of defects larger than 5 cm or containing four or more ribs will likely benefit from chest wall stabilization. For patients previously treated with radiation, even larger defects may be tolerated owing to fibrosis. For these larger defects, methyl methacrylate composite meshes are used and covered with vascularized tissue. Contaminated wounds are generally reconstructed with bioprosthetic mesh rather than synthetic mesh. Using these principles, the reconstructive plastic surgeon can devise a comprehensive and safe plan to repair tremendous defects of the chest wall.","Mahabir, Raman Chaos; Butler, Charles E",Seminars in plastic surgery,565,24

This is important at weaning, when animals are exposed to infectious agents and stresses. We have developed a rat model of intestinal inflammation post weaning, based on the systemic administration of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB). Since the inflammatory response obtained is mild, the food intake pattern is not affected, which makes this model useful for studies of nutritional therapies for intestinal inflammatory disease. SEB increased T-lymphocytes in Peyer's patches and the number of activated T-lymphocytes in mesenteric lymph nodes (organized GALT). In the lamina propria, SEB increased activated T-lymphocytes as well as cytotoxic and natural killer-cell populations of the diffuse GALT. It also increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators in both Peyer's patches and mucosa. Rats given SEB had higher paracellular permeability to macromolecules, which was associated with a reduction in epithelial tightness. This model was used to examine whether dietary supplementation with spray-dried animal plasma proteins affects intestinal inflammation. Results showed that dietary plasma proteins can attenuate the mucosal immune response in both organized and diffuse GALT and that these effects are mediated by a reduction in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.","Pérez-Bosque, Anna; Moretó, Miquel",The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,565,17

The academic world is no exception. In South Africa, due to a nationwide lockdown imposed by government, universities had to suspend all academic activities, but very quickly explored online teaching and learning options in order to ensure continued education to students. As far as Clinical Legal Education, or CLE, is concerned, such online options of teaching and learning could present problems to university law faculties, university law clinics and law students in general, as CLE is a practical methodology, usually following a live-client or simulation model, depending on the particular university and law clinic. This article provides insight into the online methodology followed by the Nelson Mandela University, or NMU. The NMU presents CLE as part of its Legal Practice-module and conventionally follows the live-client model. As the national lockdown in South Africa required inter alia social distancing, the live-client model had been temporarily suspended by the NMU Law Faculty Management Committee and replaced with an online methodology. The aim of this was an attempt to complete the first semester of the academic year in 2020. This online methodology is structured so as to provide practical-oriented training to students relating to a wide variety of topics, including the drafting of legal documents, divorce matters, medico-legal practice, labour legal practice, criminal legal practice, and professional ethics. The online training took place in two staggered teaching and learning pathways in line with the strategy of the NMU, underpinned by the principle of ""no student will be left behind."" In this way, provision had been made for students with online connectivity and access to electronic devices, students with online connectivity only after return to campus or another venue where connectivity is possible and electronic devices are available, and for students who do not have access to online connectivity and electronic devices at all. The reworked CLE-programme of the NMU, planned for the second semester of the 2020-academic year, will also be discussed in this article. The online methodology followed by the NMU should however not be viewed as definitive or cast in stone in any way. There might be – and there surely are – alternative methodologies, both online and otherwise, that may provide equally good or even better training to CLE students during a global pandemic. Alternative suggestions in this regard will also be discussed in this article. It is hoped that this article will provide inspiration and assistance to university law faculties and law clinics that are struggling to engage with continued practical legal education during the testing and uncertain times brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. It is further hoped that this article may provide guidance in other difficult and unforeseen future instances that may await CLE. In this regard, it is important to remember that the Fourth Industrial Revolution is rapidly increasing its grip on the world and that CLE will have to adapt to the demands thereof. © 2020, North-West Unversity.

Because of a series of global and regional""black swans,""such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. stock market triggered the circuit breaker three times within one week of March 9 to 16, which is unprecedented throughout history. Affected by the whole circumstance, the stock prices of individual corporations also plummeted by rates that were never predicted by any pre-developed forecasting models. It reveals that there was a lack of satisfactory models that could predict the changes in stocks prices when catastrophic, highly unlikely events occur. To fill the void of such models and to help prevent investors from heavy losses during uncertain times, this paper aims to capture the movement pattern of stock prices under anomalous circumstances. First, we detect outliers in sequential stock prices by fitting a standard ARIMA model and identifying the points where predictions deviate significantly from actual values. With the selected data points, we train ARIMA and LSTM models at the single-stock level, industry level, and general market level, respectively. Since the public moods affect the stock market tremendously, a sentiment analysis is also incorporated into the models in the form of sentiment scores, which are converted from comments about specific stocks on Reddit. Based on 100 companies' stock prices in the period of 2016 to 2020, the models achieve an average prediction accuracy of 98% which can be used to optimize existing prediction methodologies.","Ruan, Jinlong; Wu, Wei; Luo, Jiebo",,565,10

A better understanding of the immune memory and functional humoral immunity directed at the emerging Variants of Concern (VoC) strains after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is essential for predicting the longevity of heterotypic protection. Objective. The aim of our study was to characterize functional humoral immunity (including memory B cell response) after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and to determine/compare the reactivity of COVID-19 vaccine-induced memory B cells to the emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VoC). Design, setting, participants and interventions. We designed an exploratory longitudinal observational (convenience sample-based) study at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN that enrolled and followed naive subjects and recovered COVID-19 subjects from Olmsted County, MN and surrounding areas after COVID-19 vaccination in January-June 2021. The study enrolled 17 relatively healthy subjects, 59% females and 94% White/Non-Hispanic or Latino with median age at enrollment 41 years. The subjects received either the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNtech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine (n=3) and provided a blood sample at baseline, at;3 weeks after their first vaccine dose/before the second dose, and at;2 weeks after the receipt of their second vaccine dose. Main outcomes and measures. Spike-specific humoral and memory B cells responses were assessed over time after vaccination against the original Wuhan-Hu-1/vaccine and against emerging VoC strains/antigens. Results. We observed a robust neutralizing antibody response after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, but a reduction in the functional antibody activity to several of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 VoC. Consistent with this, we also found differences in the number of isotype-switched/IgG+ MBCs responding to homologous and variant receptor-binding domain/RBDs after vaccination. We found a reduction of MBCs reactive to RBDs of Beta, Gamma and Delta SARS-CoV-2 VoC strains. Conclusion and relevance. In this exploratory study in subjects following receipt of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, we found differences in antibody titers observed for VoCs after vaccination that are accompanied with, and can partially be explained by, decreased MBC reactivity against the VoCs. This can further attenuate the generated recall humoral immune response upon exposure to these variants.","Haralambieva, I. H.; Monroe, J. M.; Grill, D. E.; Ovsyannikova, I. G.; Poland, G.

We conducted in-depth interviews with patients across the United States to better understand the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on their cancer care, emotional and mental health, and to solicit suggestions for how health care providers could mitigate these concerns. Methods: We contacted respondents from the Impact of COVID-19 on Cancer parent study. The parent study used a snowball sampling approach to survey patients nationally regarding cancer delays between April 2020 and October 2020. We invited all respondents who volunteered for future studies to participate in a 40-minute interview regarding their experiences and suggestions for how health care providers could mitigate COVID19-related concerns. Interviews were conducted between August 2020 and October 2020, recorded, transcribed and analyzed using qualitative thematic content analysis. Results: A total of 34 participants were contacted and consented to participate in this study. Four overarching themes were identified: (1) significant concern regarding infection risk;(2) concerns regarding care changes, such as delays, worsening cancer outcomes;(3) concern regarding loss of employment, health insurance, and transportation on cancer treatment, affordability, and prognosis;and (4) worsening emotional and mental health due to social isolation. Suggestions for the clinical team included: 1) specific and direct guidance from health care providers on how to mitigate infection risk;2) screening for and access to mental health services;3) continuation of cancer treatment, surveillance, and clinical trials without delays and 4) allowing caregivers to attend appointments. Conclusions: In this national qualitative study of patients with cancer, participants identified that COVID-19 and modifications to their cancer care worsened their emotional and mental health with growing concerns about the impact of the virus and socioeconomic status on their cancer outcomes. Specific suggestions for health care providers, such as anticipatory guidance, access to mental health services, and expanded visitation should be considered to improve patient experiences with care during the pandemic.","Kumar, D.; Khateeb, S.; Patel, M.

All reported changes have potential effects in terms of food waste, which is a global problem that mainly occurs at household level. Many scholars attempted to understand the antecedents of food waste in the framework of Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). In this paper we follow this strain of research by focussing on two different behaviours, suggested by the Waste Framework Directive of the EU, namely (a) reducing servings and (b) using leftovers, which may be predicted by the intention to reduce food waste. An online questionnaire containing the key constructs of the TPB and the concern towards the pandemic was administered to a sample of 201 Italian consumers. Results show that the TPB model was confirmed for both behaviours while the Covid-19 concern had no direct effect. However, in the case of portion reduction, there is a significant interaction between concern and intention not to waste food. That is, the effect of intention on reducing servings is increasing as the level of concern increases. Therefore, some indications on how to address food waste policies are drawn.","Amato, Mario Verneau Fabio Coppola Adele La Barbera Francesco",Sustainability,565,11

Given the both paucity and lack of consensus among data on statin's efficacy and safety amongst COVID-19 patients, the current guideline is to continue statin in COVID-19 patients, who have previously been treated with statins. The aim of this paper was to compare hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who did and did not receive statins, in terms of COVID-19 outcomes. Methods: We conducted population-based retrospective study using South Korea's nationwide healthcare database as of May 15 2020. We identified 4,349 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and aged 40 years or older. The cohort entry was defined as the date of hospitalization. Statin users were individuals with inpatient and outpatient prescription records of statins in the 240 days before cohort entry, and non-users were those without such records during this period. Our primary outcome was a composite endpoint of all-cause death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation use and cardiovascular outcomes (myocardial infarction (MI), transient cerebral ischemic attacks (TIA) or stroke). We conducted inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), to compare outcomes between statin users and non-users. Findings: 1,115 patients were statin users (mean age = 65.9 years; 60% female), and 3,234 were non-users (mean age = 58.3 years; 64% female). Statin use was not associated with increased risk of the primary outcome (IPTW OR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.60-1.11). Subgroup analysis showed a protective role of statins, for individuals with hypertension (IPTW OR 0.40; 95% CI: 0.23-0.69, p for interaction: 0.0087). Interpretation: Given that statins are not detrimental and that it may be beneficial amongst hypertensive patients and relatively cheap, we would encourage further investigation into statin for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Chow, R.; Lee, J.; Noh, H.; Shin, H.

VHH60 competes with human ACE2 to bind the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein with a KD of 2.56 nM, inhibits infections of both live SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotyped viruses harboring wildtype, escape mutations and prevailing variants at nanomolar level. VHH60 also suppresses SARS-CoV-2 infection and propagation 50-fold better and protects mice from death two times longer than that of control group after live virus inoculation on mice.

With decreased economic activity, the sports industry faces significant challenges of maintaining athletes’ mental health while seeking the best strategies for eventual return to sports competition.ObjectivesWe aim to evaluate COVID-19 related factors impacting on the mental health of athletes and provide appropriate management steps.MethodsWe examined MeSH terms “Athletes,” “Sports,” “COVID-19,” in the context of “Mental Health,” “Mental Disorders,” “Behavioral Medicine,” “Risk Factors.” We identified seven studies for the qualitative synthesis per the PRISMA guidelines, searching Medline, PubMed, PubMed Central, and PsychInfo databases until July 2020.ResultsThe pandemic has negatively impacted athletes’ mental wellbeing due to decreased physical activities, limited resources, fears, and delays or cancellations of the sporting event. The negative psychological impact on athletes is due to self-isolation measures leading to worries of less preparedness for the lockdown, reduced physical activity, loss of competitive advantages, fear of being infected, social isolation, and loneliness. During this period, athletes struggled to maintain baseline routine and engaged in excessive calorie intake, eating low-quality food, substance use, and sleep disruption. It has caused anxiety, depression, PTSD, and mood disorder at varying degrees of severity in athletes.ConclusionsLimited resources during a pandemic have caused adverse mental impact on athletes. We recommend improving physical activity through confined or virtual training programs with colleagues. A collaborative approach is required by clinicians, psychologists, coaches, sports organizations, government bodies to limit the pandemic’s mental health impact.","Shah, K.; Jain, S.; Glick, I.",European Psychiatry,565,1

There are two ways to reduce elevated CO2 concentrations ([CO2]high): reducing human emissions or increasing their absorption by oceans and plants. However, in response to [CO2]high, plants diminish gas exchange and CO2 uptake by closing stomata. Surprisingly, we do not know how plants sense CO2 in their environment, and the basic mechanisms of the plant response to [CO2]high are very poorly understood. Here, we show that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are plant CO2 receptors. We demonstrate that MPK4, a prominent MAPK that is known to be involved in the stomatal response to [CO2]high1–3, is capable of binding CO2 and is directly activated by a very low increase in [CO2] in vivo and in vitro. Unlike MPK4 activation by infections4, stress and hormones within known MAPK signalling cascades, [CO2]high-induced MPK4 activation is independent of the upstream regulators MKK1 and MKK2. Moreover, once activated, MPK4 is prone to inactivation by bicarbonate. The identification of stress-responsive MPK4 as a CO2 receptor sheds new light on the integration of various environmental signals in guard cells, setting up MPK4 as the main hub regulating CO2 availability for photosynthesis. This result could help to find new ways to increase CO2 uptake by plants.","Gałgańska, Hanna; Gałgański, Łukasz",bioRxiv,565,1

However, the emergence and rapid spread of highly transmissible variants combined with slowing down the pace of vaccination created uncertainty around the future trajectory of the epidemic. In this study we analyze the expected benefits of offering vaccination to children age 5-11 under differing conditions for in-person schooling. Methods: We adapted a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, calibrated to data from King County, Washington, to handle multiple variants with increased transmissibility and virulence as well as differential vaccine efficacies against each variant. Reactive social distancing is implemented driven by fluctuations in the number of hospitalizations in the county. We simulate scenarios offering vaccination to children aged 5-11 with different starting dates and different proportions of physical interactions (PPI) in schools being restored. The impact of improving overall vaccination coverage among the eligible population is also explored. Cumulative hospitalizations, percentage reduction of hospitalizations and proportion of time at maximum social distancing over the 2021-2022 school year are reported. Findings: In the base-case scenario with 85% vaccination coverage of 12+ year-olds, our model projects 4945 (median, IQR 4622-5341) total COVID-19 hospitalizations and 325 (median, IQR 264-400) pediatric hospitalizations if physical contacts at schools are fully restored (100% PPI) for the entire school year compared to 3675 (median, IQR 2311-4725) and 163 (median, IQR 95-226) if schools remained closed. Reducing contacts in schools to 75% PPI or 50% PPI through masking, ventilation and distancing is expected to decrease the overall cumulative hospitalizations by 2% and 4% respectively and youth hospitalizations by 8% and 23% respectively. Offering early vaccination to children aged 5-11 with 75% PPI is expected to prevent 756 (median, IQR 301-1434) hospitalizations and cut hospitalizations in the youngest age group in half compared to no vaccination. It will largely reduce the need of additional social distancing over the school year. If, in addition, 90% overall vaccination coverage is reached, 60% of remaining hospitalizations will be averted and the need of extra mitigation measures almost certainly avoided. Conclusions: Our work highlights that in-person schooling is possible if reasonable precaution measures are taken at schools to reduced infectious contacts. Rapid vaccination of all school-aged children will provide meaningful reduction of the COVID health burden over this school year but only if implemented early. Finally, it remains critical to vaccinate as many people as possible to limit the morbidity and mortality associated with the current surge in Delta variant cases.","Bracis, C.; Moore, M.; Swan, D.

Flash Glucose Monitoring System (FGMS) was introduced for CF patients, shielding due to COVID-19, as part of their CF annual review (A/R) alongside chest status, weight and HbA1c. Methods: • A/R information sheet outlining reason for using FGMS and sharing data agreement via Libre View. • Video consultation with Dietitian/CF Diabetes Nurse to discuss and support insertion of Libre sensor and link to sharing data. • Patients completed 2 weeks of daily scanning and food diary. • 2 weekly CFRD MDT data analysis, using the Brompton CGM criteria for CFRD diagnosis (see table 1). [Table presented] Results: • Good uptake of CFRD screening process. • 13 patients screened with FGMS (see table 2). • Monitoring of glucose against timely food diary, using Libre View App. • FGMS has identified patients with impaired glucose handling that may have been missed on OGTT. • Patients able to observe effect of food on blood glucose levels. [Table presented] Conclusion: Using the FGMS has enhanced patient's compliance with A/R screening for CFRD. The FGMS has identified early diagnosis of patients with CFRD and patients with delayed insulin response leading to effective insulin treatment and appropriate dietary changes. Feedback to the patient following A/R has been quicker and more efficient due to video consultations and the sharing of glucose results and food diary via the App and Libre View sharing agreement.

In the present study, we evaluated the feasibility of a telephone-based teleconsultation cardiology service and compared the use of testing and outcomes between teleconsultation and traditional in-office consultations Methods: The study took place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic July 2019 to March 2020. Consult lists were reviewed by a cardiologist for patients appropriate for teleconsultation. Those patients were contacted directly and, if agreeable, a consultation was completed and any required testing was arranged. A series of patients seen in the clinic, matched for a reason for consultation and consulting a cardiologist, were compared in terms of testing frequency and outcomes. Results: Of 157 patients who felt appropriate for teleconsultation, 100 (63.7%) were successfully contacted and a teleconsultation was completed. Comparing patients undergoing teleconsultation with a matched series of patients seen in person in the clinic, there were no significant differences in testing utilization or outcomes, including emergency room or hospital admission within 30 days of consultation or death or adverse cardiac events at six months following consultation. Conclusion: Telemedicine can be successfully utilized as an alternative to traditional clinic consultation for selected patients needing cardiology consultation. This consultative modality does not appear to lead to utilization of increased testing or decreased quality or patient outcomes. Larger studies are needed to assess this mode of consultation. © 2021 Matsumura et al.","Matsumura, M. E.; Austin, K.; Khalil, Y.; Blankenship, J.

The attachment process initiates a series of conformational changes resulting in the loss of genomic RNA from the virion. X-ray crystallography and sequence comparisons suggested that a deep crevice or canyon is the site on the virus recognized by the cellular receptor molecule. This has now been verified by electron microscopy of human rhinovirus 14 (HRV14) and HRV16 complexed with a soluble component of ICAM-1. A hydrophobic pocket underneath the canyon is the site of binding of various hydrophobic drug compounds that can inhibit attachment and uncoating. This pocket is also associated with an unidentified, possibly cellular in origin, ""pocket factor."" The pocket factor binding site overlaps the binding site of the receptor.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This four-year cross-sectional study was concocted on 100 workers of two detergent factories in Semnan, Iran. Two questionnaires were used for data collection. The first questionnaire included demographic and occupational information, and the second questionnaire included spirometric parameters, such as forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio, peak expiratory flow (PEF), and PEF 25–75%. The spirometric parameters were measured over four consecutive years by a trained technician. Next, to determine the effects of chlorine gas exposure and its associated factors on spirometric parameters, a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used. The correlation structure of GEE was considered to be autoregressive 1 (AR-1). Analyses were performed in STATA version 14. RESULTS: All spirometric parameters showed a decreasing trend during 2012–2015. The GEE model showed a significant association between chlorine gas exposure and all spirometric parameters; the beta-coefficients for the effect of exposure (year) on FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, PEF, and PEF 25–75% were −4.51, −6.46, −4.27, −6.09, and −10.29, respectively. Also, this model demonstrated a significant association between smoking and FEV1, PEF, and PEF 25–75%; the beta-coefficients for the effect of smoking on these parameters were −5.64, −8.88, and −5.75, respectively. Additionally, the GGE model showed a significant association between the body mass index (BMI) and FVC and FEV1 (P<0.05); the beta-coefficients for the effect of BMI on these two parameters were − 0.59 and −0.48, respectively. CONCLUSION: The spirometric parameters showed a decreasing trend over time among detergent industry workers; this decline was more remarkable among individuals with a history of smoking. Therefore, it seems necessary to implement screening programs and periodic active examinations for these workers.","Malek, Farhad; Shomali, Amir; Mirmohammadkhani, Majid; Mansori, Kamyar; Pahlevan, Daryoush",Tanaffos,565,28

A study was undertaken to investigate the sputum cell and cytokine characteristics of COPD when stable and during an exacerbation. METHODS Induced sputum samples from 57 patients with moderate to severe COPD were analysed (44 samples were taken during a stable period and 37 during an exacerbation). The patients recorded daily symptoms on diary cards. Cell counts and sputum levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 were measured. RESULTS Patients with >/=3 exacerbations/year had higher median stable sputum levels of IL-6 (110 (95% CI 11 to 215) pg/ml) and IL-8 (6694 (95% CI 3120 to 11995) pg/ml) than those with =2 exacerbations/year (22 (95% CI 12 to 93) and 1628 (95% CI 607 to 4812) pg/ml, respectively). Median IL-6 levels were increased during exacerbations compared with stable conditions. The levels of IL-6 during exacerbations were related to the presence of a cold and to the total cell count and eosinophil and lymphocyte numbers, while IL-8 was positively correlated with all sputum cell counts. Sputum cell counts and cytokine levels during an exacerbation did not predict the size and duration of lung function changes in the exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS Patients with more frequent exacerbations have higher baseline sputum cytokine levels, which may predict the frequency of future exacerbations.","Bhowmik, A; Seemungal, T A; Sapsford, R J; Wedzicha, J A",Thorax,565,17

Such poliovirus replicons require the presence of helper virus for their successful propagation and thus are similar to defective interfering (DI) viruses. In genomes containing the CAT gene, the majority of the P1 virus capsid region of the poliovirus genome could be removed without destroying viability. The smallest replicon was significantly smaller than any naturally occurring DI particle so far reported, yet it retained the ability to replicate and be encapsidated by structural proteins provided by helper virus in trans. The efficiency with which the replicons were encapsidated was investigated using a direct immunostaining technique that allows individual cells infected with either a replicon or helper virus to be quantified. These results were compared to the frequencies of trans-encapsidation of polioviruses and coxsackievirus B4 using a two-stage neutralization assay. Poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 but not coxsackievirus B4, coxsackievirus A21 or rhinovirus 14 provided efficient trans-encapsidation of poliovirus type 3 or type 3-derived replicons. These results suggest that a specific encapsidation process operates and that it does not involve RNA sequences within the region of the genome encoding the capsid proteins.","Barclay, W; Li, Q; Hutchinson, G; Moon, D; Richardson, A; Percy, N; Almond, J W; Evans, D J",The Journal of general virology,565,20

Indeed, a number of variants with deletions in the spike glycoprotein have been isolated from persistently infected animals. However, the significance of generating and potentially accumulating deletion variants in the persisting viral RNA population is unclear. To study this issue, we evaluated the evolution of spike variants by examining the population of spike RNA sequences detected in the brains and spinal cords of mice inoculated with coronavirus and sacrificed at 4, 42, or 100 days postinoculation. We focused on the S1 hypervariable region since previous investigators had shown that this region is subject to recombination and deletion. RNA isolated from the brains or spinal cords of infected mice was rescued by reverse transcription-PCR, and the amplified products were cloned and used in differential colony hybridizations to identify individual isolates with deletions. We found that 11 of 20 persistently infected mice harbored spike deletion variants (SDVs), indicating that deletions are common but not required for persistent infection. To determine if a specific type of SDV accumulated during persistence, we sequenced 106 of the deletion isolates. We identified 23 distinct patterns of SDVs, including 5 double-deletion variants. Furthermore, we found that each mouse harbored distinct variants in its central nervous system (CNS), suggesting that SDVs are generated during viral replication in the CNS. Interestingly, mice with the most severe and persisting neurological disease harbored the most prevalent and diverse quasispecies of SDVs. Overall, these findings illustrate the complexity of the population of persisting viral RNAs which may contribute to chronic disease.","Rowe, C L; Baker, S C; Nathan, M J; Fleming, J O",Journal of virology,565,24

However, the central processes in the evolution of emerging viruses are unclear, particularly the selection pressures faced by viruses in new host species. We outline some of the key evolutionary genetic aspects of viral emergence. We emphasize that, although the high mutation rates of RNA viruses provide them with great adaptability and explain why they are the main cause of emerging diseases, their limited genome size means that they are also subject to major evolutionary constraints. Understanding the mechanistic basis of these constraints, particularly the roles played by epistasis and pleiotropy, is likely to be central in explaining why some RNA viruses are more able than others to cross species boundaries. Viral genetic factors have also been implicated in the emergence of SARS-CoV, with the suggestion that this virus is a recombinant between mammalian and avian coronaviruses. We show, however, that the phylogenetic patterns cited as evidence for recombination are more probably caused by a variation in substitution rate among lineages and that recombination is unlikely to explain the appearance of SARS in humans.","Holmes, Edward C; Rambaut, Andrew","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

This study analyzes this conflation of ethnicity and disease victimization by considering the stigmatization process that occurred during the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Toronto. The attribution of stigma during the SARS outbreak occurred in multiple and overlapping ways informed by: (i) the depiction of images of individuals donning respiratory masks; (ii) employment status in the health sector; and (iii) Asian-Canadian and Chinese-Canadian ethnicity. In turn, stigmatization during the SARS crisis facilitated a moral panic of sorts in which racism at a cultural level was expressed and rationalized on the basis of a rhetoric of the new public health and anti-globalization sentiments. With the former, an emphasis on individualized self-protection, in the health sense, justified the generalized avoidance of those stigmatized. In relation to the latter, in the post-9/11 era, avoidance of the stigmatized other was legitimized on the basis of perceiving the SARS threat as a consequence of the mixing of different people predicated by economic and cultural globalization.","Ali, S Harris",Canadian ethnic studies,565,7

The objective of the study was to describe the follow-up of transplanted people with suspected COVID19 infection. METHODS Descriptive, cross-sectional, observational study with prospective follow-up carried out between March and June 2020. Sociodemographic and clinical data were recorded for the assessment, control and follow-up of the cases. The results were expressed with means and standard deviation, median and interquartile range, or frequencies and percentages. The chi-square test was used to compare qualitative variables and the Student's T test to compare quantitative variables with normal distribution. If they did not follow a normal distribution, the Mann Whitney U test was used. The level of statistical significance was established at p<0.05. RESULTS A total of 56 patients were included, with a mean of 62.73±13.01 years and a median of 39.5 [7.5; 93] months transplanted. 2.48±2.69 calls/patient were made during a period of 3.46±4.41 days. Virtual follow-up was performed with 100% (n=56) and 71.43% (n=40) required hospital admission at some point. 28.57% (n=16) of the people evaluated were managed at home.

Full-length E dimers obtained by solubilization of virus with the detergent Triton X-100 formed trimers at low pH, whereas truncated E dimers lacking the stem-anchor region underwent a reversible dissociation into monomers without forming trimers. These data suggest that the low-pH-induced rearrangement in virions is a two-step process involving a reversible dissociation of the E dimers followed by an irreversible formation of trimers, a process which requires the stem-anchor portion of the protein.

METHODS One hundred thirty-three cases of SARS admitted from May to June 2003 in our hospital were included in the study. Maximal dose, average daily dose, treatment course and fasting plasma glucose level (FPG) were recorded. Corticosteroid-induced diabetes was diagnosed if FPG was equal to or higher than 7 mmol/L twice or more after the administration of glucocorticoids. RESULTS Ninety five patients (71.9%) were prescribed with glucocorticoid among the 132 patients. Thirty-three patients (36.3%) were diagnosed as corticosteroid-induced diabetes according to the FPG. Significant differences were found in daily maximal dosage, duration of treatment and average dosage of methylprednisolone between the patients with and without corticosteroid-induced diabetes (275 mg/d vs 136 mg/d, 24 d vs 16 d, 139 mg/d vs 91 mg/d, P < 0.01). As compared with the lowest tertile, the frequency of diabetes in SARS patients treated with highest tertile of maximal daily dosage, treatment duration, average dosage or total dosage were significantly higher (64.7% vs 13.0, 61.9% vs 17.4%, 62.5% vs 21.7%, and 59.2% vs 13.6%, P < 0.05 for all comparisons). If the patients were treated with an average dose less than 90 mg/d and treatment duration shorter than 15 days, the diabetes incidence was 10.5%. After adjusting age and sex, the daily maximal dosage of methylprednisolone was the only factor that might predict the occurrence of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS Over-dose administration of methylprednisolone in SARS patients leads to a high frequency of diabetes. Decreasing the daily maximal dosage may be beneficial to the reduction of corticosteroid-induced of diabetes.","Xiao, Jian-zhong; Ma, Li; Gao, Jie; Yang, Zhao-jun; Xing, Xiao-yan; Zhao, Hong-chuan; Jiao, Jin-song; Li, Guang-wei",Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,565,9

During that time, a large body of literature rapidly emerged describing the clinical disease, the etiologic viral agent, and management options. This paper reviews the current status of this knowledge base, with particular reference to the critically ill patient. RECENT FINDINGS Case series of patients from Hong Kong, China, Singapore, and Toronto have characterized the disease with remarkable uniformity. A similarly consistent picture of the SARS patient with respiratory failure has emerged from studies from Toronto and Singapore. Worldwide collaboration led to the rapid identification and gene sequencing of the etiologic virus, SARS-CoV. SUMMARY SARS is a predominantly respiratory illness, spread through droplets from respiratory secretions and possibly via a fecal-oral route. A small number of ""super-spreaders"" appear to have contributed to the rapid proliferation of the disease. Infection control precautions are an essential component of management. Approximately 20% of patients develop progressive pulmonary infiltrates and respiratory failure, and the mortality rate is as high as 10%. Treatment strategies with antiviral agents such as ribavirin have not clearly demonstrated a benefit, but high-dose corticosteroids appear to be beneficial in patients with progressive disease. The recent outbreaks highlighted the potential for this disease to overwhelm critical care resources, by the volume of patients and loss of healthcare workers to illness and quarantine.","Lapinsky, Stephen E; Granton, John T",Current opinion in critical care,565,31

METHODS Retrospective case review of individuals 18 years or older who were admitted consecutively to Hvidovre Hospital from 10 March through 23 April 2020. RESULTS A total of 175 individuals were admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia. The median age was 71 years, 48.6% were male and 71% had at least one co-morbidity. The most commonly presenting symptoms were dyspnoea, dry cough, and fever. The majority of patients had lymphopenia, elevated liver function tests and C-reactive protein. Nearly two in three presented with multilobar infiltration by chest X-ray. Respiratory failure leading to invasive mechanical ventilation developed in 27 patients (15.4%).

J. BujarskiP. D. Nagy (1996). Semin. Virol. 7, 363-372). Here we extend these studies over BMV-derived sequences to obtain clues on prediction of homologous recombination hot spots. First, mismatch mutations, which reduced the AU content, were introduced into the common 60-nt recombination hot-spot sequence, either in the RNA2 or in both RNA2RNA3 components. This decreased the frequency of targeted homologous RNA2/RNA3 recombinationchanged the distribution of junction sites. Second, several short BMV RNA1- or RNA2-derived sequences were introduced into the RNA3 component, homologous recombination activity of these sequences was compared with that observed for previously characterized artificial sequences. Third, sequences at homologous recombinant junctions were compared among a large number of targetednontargeted recombinants. All these studies revealed several factors important for homologous recombination including the length of sequence identity, the extent of sequence identity, the AU content of the common sequences, the relative position of the AU-rich segment vs a GC-rich segment,the presence of GC-rich sequences. Based on this novel model, we suggest that recombination hot spots can be predicted by means of RNA sequence analysis. In addition, we show that recombination can occur between positivenegative strands of BMV RNAs. This provides further clues toward the mechanism of recombination processes in BMV.","Nagy, P D; Ogiela, C; Bujarski, J J",Virology,565,24

The WHO named this coronavirus 2019-nCoV, with COVID-19 being the name for diseases allied with it. Objective The study intended to examine the features and characteristics of existing human coronaviruses and identify their resemblance to the newly identified 2019-nCoV. Design The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases. We searched four databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI (Chinese Database), to identify studies reporting COVID-19. Articles published on or before April 10, 2020 were eligible for inclusion. We used the following search terms: ""Coronavirus"" or ""2019-nCoV"" or ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV"" or ""MERS-CoV"" or ""Bat SARS-CoV"" or ""ACE2 receptor"". Setting This study was take place in School of Pharmacy, Suresh Gyan Vihar University, Jaipur, India. Results The undistinguishable similarity of the genomic sequences of Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and Bat SARS-CoV-bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21-to nCoV-2019 has facilitated the process of identifying primary treatment measures. Researchers are presuming the existence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding in nCoV-2019, as in SARS-CoV. Researchers have been examining human-to-human transmission, the possibility of an intermediate host between bats and humans, and the existence of asymptomatic cases. An incubation period of 0 to 14 days has been reported, with acute to chronic symptoms being cough, nasal congestion, high fever, dyspnea, pneumonia, invasive lesions in both lungs, respiratory failure, and even death, including in pediatric cases. Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, repurposing of antivirals, and plasma infusion have proven to be somewhat effective. Several countries have started clinical trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of some drugs, but the ability to vaccinate people with existing or new molecules will require time. Previously learned lessons from SARS and MERS have led some areas to be well equipped in terms of the ability to take speedy action. Conclusions First-level treatments include repurposing antivirals and antimalarials, and plasma infusion should help, but development of existing or new molecules into vaccines will take time. The unpredictable trajectory of this outbreak demands careful surveillance to monitor the situation, draw strategies, implement control measures, and create proper ethical laws and medical guidelines.","Khan, Tahseen; Agnihotri, Kartikeya; Tripathi, Aditi; Mukherjee, Suneet; Agnihotri, Namita; Gupta, Gaurav",Alternative therapies in health and medicine,565,17

Little is known about the biogenesis of these complexes, the membrane anchoring of which is probably mediated by nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6, as they contain several putative transmembrane domains. As a first step to getting more insight into the formation of the coronavirus replication complex, the membrane topology, processing, and subcellular localization of nsp4 of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were elucidated in this study. Both nsp4 proteins became N glycosylated, while their amino and carboxy termini were localized to the cytoplasm. These observations imply nsp4 to assemble in the membrane as a tetraspanning transmembrane protein with a Nendo/Cendo topology. The amino terminus of SARS-CoV nsp4, but not that of MHV nsp4, was shown to be (partially) processed by signal peptidase. nsp4 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when expressed alone but was recruited to the replication complexes in infected cells. nsp4 present in these complexes did not colocalize with markers of the ER or Golgi apparatus, while the susceptibility of its sugars to endoglycosidase H indicated that the protein had also not traveled trough the latter compartment. The important role of the early secretory pathway in formation of the replication complexes was also demonstrated by the inhibition of coronaviral replication when the ER export machinery was blocked by use of the kinase inhibitor H89 or by expression of a mutant, Sar1[H79G].","Oostra, M; te Lintelo, E G; Deijs, M; Verheije, M H; Rottier, P J M; de Haan, C A M",Journal of virology,565,1

Currently, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), direct fluorescent antibody (DFA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques are considered standard methods for the diagnosis of BCV infection. However, these techniques are not useful if fresh tissues and intestinal contents are not available for examination. The detection of viral antigens in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues using immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a suitable alternative. In the present study, 166 tissue specimens were tested by IHC for the presence of BCV. These tissues were from animals whose feces were positive for rotavirus and/or coronavirus by TEM. Some of these samples were also tested by DFA. Thus, TEM, DFA, and IHC were compared for the detection of BCV. There was 56% agreement among the 3 methods (overall kappa = 0.368). When IHC was compared with TEM, 78% agreement was observed (kappa = 0.475). Similarly, IHC and DFA had 64% agreement (kappa = 0.277). These kappa values indicate a moderate degree of agreement between IHC and TEM; agreement between IHC and DFA was fair. The results of this study indicate that IHC may be a suitable adjunct for the detection of BCV because of its simplicity, ease of use, and relatively close correlation with TEM results.","Dar, A M; Kapil, S; Goyal, S M","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",565,1

This annual review of publications in hepatobiliary pathology highlights recent pathologic studies that can be applied to the daily practice of interpreting liver biopsy, explant, and postmortem specimens. RECENT FINDINGS The problem of the fatty liver was the subject of many studies. In chronic hepatitis C, genotype 3 infection results in moderate to marked fat that is ameliorated with successful antiviral therapy. In nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, in which the metabolic syndrome is often operative, gene microarray analysis showed altered expression of genes involved in insulin sensitivity and maintenance of mitochondrial function. Pathologic changes affecting centrilobular regions were described in the context of heart disease, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and the sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (venoocclusive disease). A mutation in ferroportin 1 produced a form of hemochromatosis with excessive iron in hepatocytes and also in Kupffer cells and macrophages. Immunostains for Hep Par 1 and polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen remain important cornerstones in the immunohistochemical diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and its distinction from metastatic adenocarcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. SUMMARY This report reviews recent articles addressing hepatobiliary pathology. In the areas of viral and drug hepatitis, fatty liver, hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, several biliary tract disorders, and pathology of liver tumors, the emerging data have important diagnostic applications.","Lefkowitch, Jay H",Current opinion in gastroenterology,565,1

In the research setting, host- and pathogen-specific factors that affect the dose-response continuum can be accounted for by experimental design, but the requirement to precisely determine the dose of infectious pathogen to which the host was exposed is often challenging. By definition, quantification of viable airborne pathogens is based on the culture of micro-organisms, but some airborne pathogens are transmissible at concentrations below the threshold of quantification by culture.

Quantitative results obtained by this technology are not only more informative than qualitative data, but simplify assay standardization and quality management. qRT-PCR assays are most established for the detection of viral load and therapy monitoring, and the development of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-associated coronavirus qRT-PCR assays provide a textbook example of the value of this technology for clinical diagnostics. The widespread use of qRT-PCR assays for diagnosis and the detection of disease-specific prognostic markers in leukaemia patients provide further examples of their usefulness. Their value for the detection of disease-associated mRNA expressed by circulating tumour cells in patients with solid malignancies is far less apparent, and the clinical significance of results obtained from such tests remains unclear. This is because of conceptual reservations as well as technical limitations that can interfere with the diagnostic specificity of qRT-PCR assays. Therefore, although it is evident that qRT-PCR assay has become a useful and important technology in the clinical diagnostic laboratory, it must be used appropriately and it is essential to be aware of its limitations if it is to fulfil its potential.","Bustin, Stephen A; Mueller, Reinhold",Clinical science,565,1

The aim of this survey was to study changes in lifestyle habits, treatment adherence, and mental health status in patients with cardiometabolic disease, but no clinical evidence of COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in ambulatory patients with cardiometabolic disease using paper/digital surveys. Variables investigated included socioeconomic status, physical activity, diet, tobacco use, alcohol intake, treatment discontinuation, and psychological symptoms. Results: A total of 4,216 patients (50.9% males, mean age 60.3 ± 15.3 years old) from 13 Spanish-speaking Latin American countries were enrolled. Among the study population, 46.4% of patients did not have contact with a healthcare provider, 31.5% reported access barriers to treatments and 17% discontinued some medication. Multivariate analysis showed that non-adherence to treatment was more prevalent in the secondary prevention group: peripheral vascular disease (OR 1.55, CI 1.08-2.24; p = 0.018), heart failure (OR 1.36, CI 1.05-1.75; p = 0.017), and coronary artery disease (OR 1.29 CI 1.04-1.60; p = 0.018).

The disease, typically characterized by bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and profound elevation of inflammatory markers, can range in severity from mild or asymptomatic illness to a lethal cytokine storm and respiratory failure. A number of recognized complications of COVID-19 infection are described in the literature. Common neurological complications include headache and anosmia. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an uncommon complication described in isolated case reports. However, a causal relationship has yet to be established. This case report adds to the growing body of evidence that GBS is a potential COVID-19 complication. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old Caucasian woman with recently diagnosed COVID-19 infection presented to the emergency department with 4 days of gradually worsening ascending lower extremity weakness. Exam revealed bilateral lower extremity weakness, mute reflexes, and sensory loss. Soon after starting intravenous administration of immunoglobulin (IVIG), the patient developed respiratory distress, eventually requiring intubation. She remained intubated for the duration of her IVIG treatment. After five rounds of treatment, the patient was successfully extubated and transferred to acute rehab. Following 4 weeks of intense physical therapy, she was able to walk with assistance on room air. CONCLUSION: At the present time, this is one of the few reports of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) or GBS associated with COVID-19 in the United States. It is unclear whether a causal relationship exists given the nature of the syndrome. However, in light of the growing number of reported cases, physicians should be aware of this possible complication when evaluating COVID-19 patients.","Gagarkin, Dmitriy A; Dombrowski, Keith E; Thakar, Keyur B; DePetrillo, John C",J Med Case Rep,565,16

Understanding the pharmacokinetics (PK) in COVID-19 patients is essential to study its exposure-efficacy/safety relationship and provide a basis for a possible dosing regimen optimization. SUBJECT AND METHODS: In this study, we used a population-based meta-analysis approach to develop a population PK model to characterize the CQ PK in COVID-19 patients. An open-label, single-center study (ethical review approval number: PJ-NBEY-KY-2020-063-01) was conducted to assess the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of CQ in patients with COVID-19. The sparse PK data from 50 COVID-19 patients, receiving 500 mg CQ phosphate twice daily for 7 days, were combined with additional CQ PK data from 18 publications. RESULTS: A two-compartment model with first-order oral absorption and first-order elimination and an absorption lag best described the data. Absorption rate (ka) was estimated to be 0.559 h-1, and a lag time of absorption (ALAG) was estimated to be 0.149 h. Apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent central volume of distribution (V2/F) was 33.3 l/h and 3630 l. Apparent distribution clearance (Q/F) and volume of distribution of peripheral compartment (Q3/F) were 58.7 l/h and 5120 l. The simulated CQ concentration under five dosing regimens of CQ phosphate were within the safety margin (400 ng/ml). CONCLUSION: Model-based simulation using PK parameters from the COVID-19 patients shows that the concentrations under the currently recommended dosing regimen are below the safety margin for side-effects, which suggests that these dosing regimens are generally safe. The derived population PK model should allow for the assessment of pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) relationships for CQ when given alone or in combination with other agents to treat COVID-19.","Yao, Xueting; Yan, Xiaoyu; Wang, Xiaohan; Cai, Ting; Zhang, Shun; Cui, Cheng; Wang, Xiaoxu; Hou, Zhe; Liu, Qi; Li, Haiyan; Lin, Jing; Xiong, Zi; Liu, Dongyang",Eur. j. clin. pharmacol,565,1

Sub-optimal Se status is common, occurring in a significant proportion of the population across the world including parts of Europe and China. Human and animal studies have shown that Se status is a key determinant of the host response to viral infections. In this review, we address the question whether Se intake is a factor in determining the severity of response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Emphasis is placed on epidemiological and animal studies which suggest that Se affects host response to RNA viruses and on the molecular mechanisms by which Se and selenoproteins modulate the inter-linked redox homeostasis, stress response and inflammatory response. Together these studies indicate that Se status is an important factor in determining the host response to viral infections. Therefore, we conclude that Se status is likely to influence human response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and that Se status is one (of several) risk factors which may impact on the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in populations where Se intake is sub-optimal or low. We suggest the use of appropriate markers to assess the Se status of COVID-19 patients and possible supplementation may be beneficial in limiting the severity of symptoms, especially in countries where Se status is regarded as sub-optimal.","Bermano, Giovanna; Méplan, Catherine; Mercer, Derry K; Hesketh, John E",Br J Nutr,565,10

In addition, understanding the transmission dynamics of the disease is also important in order to make and implement efficient public health policies. In this paper, we developed an SEIR-type compartmental model to assess the impact of adherence to COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions and indirect transmission on the dynamics of the disease. Our model considers both direct and indirect transmission routes and stratifies the population into two groups: those that adhere to COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and those that do not adhere to the NPIs.

It has been consistently shown that a high proportion of HCWs is at greater risk for developing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS). The present study systematic reviewed studies conducted in the context of the three major Coronavirus outbreaks of the last two decades to investigate risk and resilience factors for PTSD and PTSS in HCWs. Nineteen studies on the SARS 2003 outbreak, two on the MERS 2012 outbreak and three on the COVID-19 ongoing outbreak were included. Some variables were found to be of particular relevance as risk factors as well as resilience factors, including exposure level, working role, years of work experience, social and work support, job organization, quarantine, age, gender, marital status, and coping styles. It will be critical to account for these factors when planning effective intervention strategies, to enhance the resilience and reduce the risk of adverse mental health outcomes among HCWs facing the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Carmassi, Claudia; Foghi, Claudia; Dell039,; Oste, Valerio; Cordone, Annalisa; Bertelloni, Carlo Antonio; Bui, Eric; Osso, Liliana",Psychiatry Res,565,24

It is well established that the litter, not the individual fetus, is the proper independent experimental unit in statistical analysis. Accordingly, analysis is often based on the proportion affected per litter and the litter proportions are analyzed as continuous data. Because these proportional data generally do not meet assumptions of symmetry or normality, data are typically analyzed by nonparametric methods, arcsine square root transformation, or logit transformation. METHODS: We conducted power calculations to compare different approaches (nonparametric, arcsine square root-transformed, logit-transformed, untransformed) for analyzing litter-based proportional data. A reproductive toxicity study with a control and one treated group provided data for two endpoints: prenatal loss, and fertility by in utero insemination (IUI). Type 1 error and power were estimated by 10,000 simulations based on two-sample one-tailed t tests with varying numbers of litters per group. To further compare the different approaches, we conducted additional analyses with shifted mean proportions to produce illustrative scenarios. RESULTS: Analyses based on logit-transformed proportions had greater power than those based on untransformed or arcsine square root-transformed proportions, or nonparametric procedures. CONCLUSION: The logit transformation is preferred to the other approaches considered when making inferences concerning litter-based proportional endpoints, particularly with skewed distributions. The improved performance of the logit transformation becomes increasingly pronounced as the response proportions are increasingly close to the boundaries of the parameter space.","Feder, Paul I; Aume, Laura L; Triplett, Cheryl A; Simmons, Jane Ellen; Narotsky, Michael G",Birth defects res,565,10

METHODS: Corona Immunitas is a research program of coordinated, population-based, seroprevalence studies implemented by Swiss School of Public Health (SSPH+). Over 28,340 participants, randomly selected and age-stratified, with some regional specificities will be included. Additional studies in vulnerable and highly exposed subpopulations are also planned. The studies will assess population immunological status during the pandemic. RESULTS: Phase one (first wave of pandemic) estimates from Geneva showed a steady increase in seroprevalence up to 10.8% (95% CI 8.2-13.9, n = 775) by May 9, 2020. Since June, Zurich, Lausanne, Basel City/Land, Ticino, and Fribourg recruited a total of 5973 participants for phase two thus far.

The association between SRH and functional disability, defined as certification of the long-term care insurance (LTCI) system, in Japanese elderly community dwellers was examined in this study. METHODS: A total of 10,690 individuals (39.5% men, mean age of 71.4 years) who were 65 years of age or more who did not have a history of cardiovascular disease or LTCI certification were followed in this prospective study for 10.5 years. SRH was classified into four categories: good, rather good, neither good nor poor, and poor. A Cox proportional-hazards model was used to determine the hazard ratios (HRs) for the incidence of functional disability among the SRH groups for each sex. RESULTS: The number of individuals with functional disability was 3377. Men who rated poor for SRH scored significantly higher for functional disability (HR [95% confidence interval]: poor = 1.74 [1.42, 2.14]) while women who rated rather good, neither good nor poor, and poor scored significantly higher for functional disability (rather good =1.12 [1.00, 1.25], neither good nor poor = 1.29 [1.13, 1.48], poor = 1.92 [1.65, 2.24]: p for trend < 0.001 in both sexes).

However, there is evidence that highly pathogenic HCoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), infect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and are shed in the fecal matter of the infected individuals. These observations have raised questions regarding the possibility of fecal-oral route as well as foodborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. Studies regarding the survival of HCoVs on inanimate surfaces demonstrate that these viruses can remain infectious for hours to days, however, there is limited data regarding the viral survival on fresh produce, which is usually consumed raw or with minimal heat processing. To address this knowledge gap, we examined the persistence of HCoV-229E, as a surrogate for highly pathogenic HCoVs, on the surface of commonly consumed fresh produce, including: apples, tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce. Herein, we demonstrated that viral infectivity declines within a few hours post-inoculation (p.i) on apples and tomatoes, and no infectious virus was detected at 24h p.i, while the virus persists in infectious form for 72h p.i on cucumbers and lettuce. The stability of viral RNA was examined by droplet-digital RT-PCR (ddRT-PCR), and it was observed that there is no considerable reduction in viral RNA within 72h p.i.","Blondin-Brosseau, Madeleine; Harlow, Jennifer; Doctor, Tanushka; Nasheri, Neda",Food Microbiol,565,15

This study aims to investigate the potential advantages of ASD compared to intrapericardial (IPC) injection and factors affecting drug absorption through epicardium. METHODS: Liposoluble, water soluble and viscous solutions of cyanine 5 (Cy5) fluorescent dye were delivered individually through ASD and IPC in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and then tissues were isolated and observed by in vivo imaging system. Atria and ventricles of the heart were taken for the paraffin section and observed under a fluorescence microscope. RESULTS: The fluorescence intensity of Cy5 injected by ASD distributed in the heart was significantly higher than IPC injection. Whereas, the fluorescence signal spread in other tissues such as lung, liver, spleen, and kidney of ASD groups was much weaker. Moreover, when choosing liposoluble and viscous Cy5, the intensity of the heart turned stronger and fluorescence dye distributed in other tissues was lesser. CONCLUSIONS: The application of ASD device may provide a promising route of drug delivery for CHD. Furthermore, increasing viscosity of the solution and liposolublity of the drug was beneficial to facilitate drug absorption through the epicardium.","Mikrani, Reyaj; Li, Cunyu; Naveed, Muhammad; Li, Cuican; Baig, Mirza Muhammad Faran Ashraf; Zhang, Qin; Wang, Yue; Peng, Juanjuan; Zhao, Lingzhi; Zhou, Xiaohui",Pharm Res,565,16

A recent surge (second wave) in the COVID-19 cases in Europe and other temperate countries as compared to the tropical regions suggests the likely role of solar radiation. We hypothesized that ultraviolet radiation's effect might be a significant factor moderating the spread of the COVID-19 across countries. Regression analysis was done for the UV radiation data for seven hotspot cities (New Delhi, Mumbai, Milan, Madrid, New York, Melbourne and Sydney) with the daily COVID-19 cases. Global erythemal UV radiation values were lower during winter and higher during summer. In general, the daily new COVID-19 cases registered were higher during the winter months having low UV radiation dose (0.5-3.7 kJ m-2). Cases began to decline with summer onset that corresponded to increased UV radiation (2.5-6.7 kJ m-2). Our studies suggest that the natural UV radiation could be a strong determining factor moderating the spread of COVID-19 cases. The importance of UV radiation in natural sunlight as a disinfectant for SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ignored since the lockdowns were lifted; further, it can be considered as a factor for COVID management.","Desouza, Nirmala D.; Sannigrahi, Srikanta; Blaise, D.; Tan, Daniel; Cerda, Artemi",,565,16

Responsible for the continuous presence are cats that are chronically shedding a high load of FCoV. The aim of the study was to determine a possible correlation between FCoV antibody titer and frequency and load of fecal FCoV shedding in cats from catteries. METHODS: Four fecal samples from each of 82 cats originating from 19 German catteries were examined for FCoV viral loads by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Additionally, antibody titers were determined by an immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS: Cats with antibodies were more likely to be FCoV shedders than non-shedders, and there was a weak positive correlation between antibody titer and mean fecal virus load (Spearman r = 0.2984; p = 0.0072). Antibody titers were significantly higher if cats shed FCoV more frequently throughout the study period (p = 0.0063). When analyzing only FCoV shedders, cats that were RT-qPCR-positive in all four samples had significantly higher antibody titers (p = 0.0014) and significantly higher mean fecal virus loads (p = 0.0475) than cats that were RT-qPCR-positive in only one, two, or three samples. CONCLUSIONS: The cats' antibody titers correlate with the likelihood and frequency of FCoV shedding and fecal virus load. Chronic shedders have higher antibody titers and shed more virus. This knowledge is important for the management of FCoV infections in multi-cat environments, but the results indicate that antibody measurement cannot replace fecal RT-qPCR.","Felten, Sandra; Klein-Richers, Ute; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Bergmann, Michèle; Unterer, Stefan; Leutenegger, Christian M; Hartmann, Katrin",,565,14

At the time of writing this article (April 2020), the world is drastically influenced by the COVID-19. Recently, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) was published. For researchers on ID such as ourselves, it is of key interest to learn whether this open research dataset may be used to investigate the virus and its consequences for people with an ID. METHODS: From CORD-19, we identified full-text articles containing terms related to the ID care and applied a text mining technique, specifically the term frequency-inverse document frequency analysis in combination with K-means clustering. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-nine articles contained one or more of our specified terms related to ID. We were able to cluster these articles related to ID into five clusters on different topics, namely: mental health, viral diseases, diagnoses and treatments, maternal care and paediatrics, and genetics. CONCLUSION: The CORD-19 open research dataset consists of valuable information about not only COVID-19 disease but also ID and the relationship between them. We suggest researchers investigate literature-based discovery approaches on the CORD-19 and develop a new dataset that addresses the intersection of these two fields for further research.","Tummers, J; Catal, C; Tobi, H; Tekinerdogan, B; Leusink, G",J Intellect Disabil Res,565,21

DESIGN: Observational study with follow-up. SETTING: Data extraction from medical records of patients with COVID-19 admitted to Nair Hospital & TN Medical College, Mumbai, India. PARTICIPANTS: 689 patients with COVID-19 were admitted in the hospital from 26 March 2020 to 11 May 2020. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: In-hospital mortality; joint effect of comorbidity and age on the risk of dying. RESULTS: A total of 689 patients (median age 44 years) admitted with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were included in the study. Of these, 77.36% of patients were discharged alive while 22.64% died. 11.61% required some kind of oxygen support while 2.8% of patients required intensive care unit admissions.

Convalescent plasma represents a promising COVID-19 treatment. Here, we report on the manufacturing of a plasma-based product containing antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 obtained from recently recovered COVID-19 patients. Convalescent plasma donors were screened as follows: 1) previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (by real-time PCR (RT-PCR)); 2) a subsequent negative PCR test followed by a 2-week waiting period; 3) an additional negative PCR test prior to plasmapheresis; and 4) confirmation of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. Convalescent plasma was stored fresh (2-6°C) for up to 5 days or frozen (-30°C) for long-term storage. Donor peripheral blood and final plasma product were assayed for binding antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and their titers measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We performed 72 plasmaphereses resulting in 248 final products. Convalescent plasma contained an RBD-specific antibody titer (IgG) ranging from 1:100 to 1:3200 (median 1:800). The titer was congruent to the titer of the blood (n = 34) before collection (1:100-1:6400, median 1:800). Levels of IL-8 and LBP of donors were slightly increased. Therapeutic products derived from a human origin must undergo rigorous testing to ensure uniform quality and patient safety. Whilst previous publications recommended RBD-specific binding antibody titers of &#8805; 1:320, we selected a minimum titer of 1:800 in order to maximize antibody delivery. Production of highly standardized convalescent plasma was safe, feasible and was readily implemented in the treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients.","Hähnel, Viola; Peterhoff, David; Bäuerlein, Veronika; Brosig, Andreas-Michael; Pamler, Irene; Johnson, Christian; Bica, Adelina; Totir, Monica; Ossner, Thomas; Stemmer, Barbara; Toelge, Martina; Schütz, Anja; Niller, Hans-Helmut; Schmidt, Barbara; Wagner, Ralf; Gessner, André; Burkhard, Ralph; Offner, Robert",PLoS One,565,16

The scientific name of the most recently discovered corona virus disease is COVID-19. Most of the countries are performing the manual testing which is beneficial to know the actual situation, feature of the disease, so that appropriate decision can be taken. The main drawbacks of manual testing is that it is very expensive, sparse availability of testing kits, inefficient blood test, and minimum 5–6 h will require to generate the report of blood test. So in these circumstances, deep learning plays a crucial role to detect the positive cases as early as possible so as to prevent the further spread of this epidemic and provide fast and efficient treatment to the effected patients. The developed model consists of three groups: COVID-19, Influenza-A viral pneumonia, and healthy cases. Our proposed detection model got 98.78% accuracy.

The main objective of this study was to detect the presence of blaOXA-48 genes in carbapenem-resistant uropathogenic Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from urine samples from patients attending Alka Hospital, Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, Nepal. Methods: A total of 1013 mid-stream urine samples were collected from patients with suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) between April and September 2018. The identified isolates underwent antibiotic susceptibility testing using the modified Kirby-Bauer disc-diffusion method. Phenotypic carbapenemase production was confirmed by the modified Hodge test, and the blaOXA-48 gene was detected using conventional polymerase chain reaction. Results: Out of 1013 urine samples, 15.2% (154/1013) had bacterial growth. Among the isolates, 91.5% (141/154) were Gram-negative bacteria, and E. coli was the most common bacterial isolate (62.9%; 97/154), followed by K. pneumoniae 15.6% (24/154). Among 121 bacterial isolates (97 E. coli isolates and 24 K. pneumoniae isolates), 70.3% (52/121) were multidrug-resistant E. coli and 29.7% (22/121) were multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae. In addition, 9.1% (11/121) were carbapenem resistant (both imipenem and meropenem resistant). Development of multidrug resistance and development of carbapenem resistance were significantly associated (p<0.05). Of the 11 carbapenem-resistant isolates, only seven were carbapenemase producers; of these, 28.6% (2/7) were E. coli, 72.4% (5/7) were K. pneumoniae and 42.8% (3/7) had the blaOXA-48 gene. Of the three bacterial isolates with the blaOXA-48 gene, 33.3% (1/3) were E. coli and 66.7% (2/3) were K. pneumoniae. Conclusion: One in ten isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae were carbapenem resistant. Among carbapenem-resistant isolates, one-third of E. coli and two-thirds of K. pneumoniae had the blaOXA-48 gene. OXA-48 serves as a potential agent to map the distribution of resistance among clinical isolates.","Gurung, Sushma; Kafle, Sonali; Dhungel, Binod; Adhikari, Nabaraj; Thapa Shrestha, Upendra; Adhikari, Bipin; Banjara, Megha Raj; Rijal, Komal Raj; Ghimire, Prakash",Infect Drug Resist,565,1

Given the changing contextual demands associated with the pandemic for many people, the mental health consequences of COVID-19 are likely to include exposure to a range of moral dilemmas. Such dilemmas may set the stage for the development of moral distress and moral injury in a broad range of contexts from the ER to the grocery store. In the current paper we offer an approach to responding to moral dilemmas presented by COVID-19. We propose a contextual behavioral model of moral injury that is relevant to those experiencing moral pain associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on this model, we offer two different approaches to intervening on COVID-19-related moral dilemmas. First, we propose the use of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Moral Injury (ACT-MI) among individuals suffering from moral injury. Second, to intervene on moral dilemmas at the level of the group, we propose the use of the Prosocial intervention. We offer case examples describing ACT-MI and Prosocial to highlight how these interventions might be applied to moral-dilemma-related concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss implications for future research.","Borges, Lauren M.; Barnes, Sean M.; Farnsworth, Jacob K.; Drescher, Kent D.; Walser, Robyn D.",J.

Emerging evidence suggests that hesitancy to COVID-19 vaccination varies globally. Qatar has a unique population with around 90% of the population being economic migrants, and the degree and determinants of hesitancy are not known. METHODS: This study was carried out to evaluate the degree of vaccine hesitancy and its socio-demographic and attitudinal determinants across a representative sample. A national cross-sectional study using validated hesitancy measurement tool was carried out from October 15, 2020, to November 15, 2020. A total of 7821 adults completed the survey. Relevant socio-demographic data along with attitudes and beliefs around COVID-19 vaccination were collected from the respondents. RESULTS: 20.2% of the respondents stated they would not take the vaccine and 19.8% reported being unsure about taking the prospective COVID-19 vaccine. Citizens and females were more likely to be vaccine hesitators than immigrants and males, respectively. Concerns around the safety of COVID-19 vaccine and its longer-term side effects were the main concerns cited. Personal research around COVID-19 and vaccine were by far the most preferred methods that would increase confidence in accepting the vaccine across all demographic groups.

This finding comes at a time that is close to the start of mass immunization and reports from a migrant-majority population highlighting important socio-demographic determinants around vaccine hesitancy.","Alabdulla, Majid; Reagu, Shuja Mohd; Al-Khal, Abdullatif; Elzain, Marwa; Jones, Roland M",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,565,21
235205,235205,235205,Pain Management During COVID-19 and Steroids: Striking a Balance,19.23352,7.4616265,2020,"Introduction: The coronavirus (COVID-19) disease has spread worldwide, generating intense fear of infection and death that may lead to enduring anxiety. At the same time, quarantine and physical isolation can intensify feelings of dispositional loneliness that, by focusing on thoughts of disconnection from others, can trigger intense anxiety. Anxiety, generated by both fear of COVID-19 and dispositional loneliness, can activate negative expectations and thoughts of death, potentially generating alarming depressive symptoms. However, the anxiety-buffer hypothesis suggests that self-esteem acts as a shield (buffer) against mental health threats - fear and loneliness - thus hampering anxiety and depressive symptoms. Objective: This study aims to test the process - triggered by COVID-19 fear and loneliness - in which self-esteem should buffer the path leading to anxiety symptoms, then to depression. Methods: An observational research design with structural equation models was used. A sample of 1200 participants enrolled from the general population answered an online survey comprising: the fear of COVID-19 scale, the UCLA loneliness scale, the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, and the anxiety and depression scales of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised. Results: Structural equation models showed the link between anxiety symptoms (mediator) with both the fear of COVID-19 and dispositional loneliness (predictors), as well as its association with consequent depressive symptomatology (outcome). In line with the anxiety-buffer hypothesis, self-esteem mediated the relationship between the predictors and their adverse psychological consequences. Conclusion: Self-esteem represents a protective factor from the antecedents of depression. Targeted psychological interventions should be implemented to minimize the psychological burden of the disease whilst promoting adaptation and positive psychological health outcomes.","Rossi, Alessandro; Panzeri, Anna; Pietrabissa, Giada; Manzoni, Gian Mauro; Castelnuovo, Gianluca; Mannarini, Stefania",Front Psychol,565,1

Knowledge of the association between the development of ESR1 mutation and the clinicopathologic features may guide the decision-making process of metastatic breast cancer treatment, including endocrine therapy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between the development of ESR1 mutation and the clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with MBC. To evaluate the association between the development of ESR1 mutation and clinicopathologic features, a cohort of 22 patients with MBC were retrospectively analyzed using next generation sequencing. In 14 of 22 patients, four mutations were detected on the metastatic site, including Tyr537Ser, Glu542Asp, Leu536Arg and Arg548Cys. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the duration of aromatase inhibitor and selective estrogen receptor modulator treatment, as well as the age of treatment initiation for early-stage breast cancer, were significantly associated with the development of ESR1 mutation. ESR1 mutation was identified in all five patients who received selective estrogen receptor modulators in the adjuvant setting followed by aromatase inhibitors in the metastatic setting, as well as in two of the three patients who received no selective estrogen receptor modulators in adjuvant setting followed by aromatase inhibitors in the metastatic setting. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that administrating adjuvant selective estrogen receptor modulator followed by aromatase inhibitor for metastasis may increase the frequency of ESR1 mutation.","Takeshima, Kaoru; Hayashida, Tetsu; Maeda, Hinako; Nakashoji, Ayako; Yokoe, Takamichi; Seki, Tomoko; Takahashi, Maiko; Kitagawa, Yuko",Oncol Lett,565,24

The classical right lateral subseptal access may sometimes provide difficult exposure, so that alternative approaches are used whose effects on atrial electrical activity are contradictory. OBJECTIVE:To standardize an investigative method to evaluate heart electrical activity post-op. METHODS: Ten consecutive adult patients with mitral valve disease were operated on. Surface electrocardiogram and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring (Holter system) pre and post-op., and epicardical cardioestimulation post-op. were used to study cardiac electric activity. RESULTS: There was no mortality. All patients with sinus rhythm presented supraventricular ectopia, with episodes of supraventricular tachycardia in 57%, atrial flutter in 10%, and junctional rhythm in 10%. All patients presented ventricular ectopia, with a low incidence in 70% of them and with unsustained ventricular tachycardia in 30%. During the postoperative period there was a 40% rate of new supraventricular arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, junctional rhythm, low atrial rhythm, and paroxistic supraventricular tachycardia), with no ventricular arrhythmias. Post-op. sinus node function was preserved. There was a significant reduction of supraventricular ectopia, with reversal of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm in one patient. Although there was a significant reduction in left atrium size post-op, P wave duration, as well as ventricular ectopia rate remained unchanged. Interatrial conduction time correlated with left atrium size measured pre and post-op. CONCLUSION: The methods proved useful to evaluate atrial electric activity in patients operated upon by the classic subseptal access, thus permitting future comparisons with other surgical approaches to the mitral valve.","Augusto Ferreira, Cesar; Villela de Andrade Vicente, Walter; José Rodriguez, Alfredo; Dorival Campos, Antonio; Rosa e Silva Júnior, Jairo; Sarabanda, Álvaro; Osvaldo Pyntia, Antonio",Acta cir. bras.,565,15

Undocumented workers that might choose not to comply would risk the loss of employment (with no access to unemployment benefits due to their immigration status) and eviction from employer provided housing. Due to the nature of working and living conditions on farms, social distancing among farmworkers is nearly impossible and farmworkers were not provided with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) until infections were at an alarmingly high rate in NYS. Once infected, farmworkers were directed to contact County Health Departments that were frequently unfamiliar with the farmworker population and often lacked the necessary language or cultural competency skills to provide services to that community. Local community members expressed opinions that immigrant farmworkers were transmitters of the virus contributing to high levels of fear and mistrust in rural communities.

The coactivator proteins adopt two hotspot sites, namely &#945;-helix and &#937;-loop, to interact with TEAD. Here, we demonstrate that both the &#945;-helix and &#937;-loop peptides cannot maintain in structured state when splitting from the full-length coactivator proteins; they exhibit a large intrinsic disorder in free state that prevents the coactivator peptide recognition by TEAD. Rational design is used to optimize the interfacial residues of coactivator &#945;-helix peptides, which can effectively improve the favorable direct readout effect upon the peptide binding to TEAD. Chemical modification is employed to constrain the free &#945;-helix peptide into native ordered conformation. The method introduces an all-hydrocarbon bridge across i and i + 4 residues to stabilize the helical structure of a free coactivator peptide, which can considerably reduce the unfavorable indirect readout effect upon the peptide binding to TEAD. The all-hydrocarbon bridge is designed to point out of the TEAD-peptide complex interface, which would not disrupt the direct intermolecular interaction between the TEAD and peptide. Therefore, the stapling only improves peptide affinity, but does not alter peptide specificity, to TEAD. Affinity assay confirms that the binding potency of coactivator &#945;-helix peptides is improved substantially by >5-fold upon the rational design and chemical modification. Structural analysis reveals that the optimized/stapled peptides can form diverse nonbonded interactions such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts with TEAD, thus conferring stability and specificity to the TEAD-peptide complex systems.","Gao, Shuxia; Wang, Yingchao; Ji, Lijuan",J Recept Signal Transduct Res,565,16

Hydroxychloroquine has been suggested as a possible treatment; however, it is associated with multiple adverse reactions. We report a rare case of a patient with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis with Stevens-Johnson syndrome due to hydroxychloroquine. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis is characterized by acute onset of a generalized rash that is pustular and erosive in nature, affecting limbs; trunk; face; and, less often, mucosal membranes. Although rare, it is important to be mindful of this side effect because the diagnosis is often delayed, and the disease has the potential to be life-threatening. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old American woman presented to our hospital with a painful, rapidly spreading rash. Its morphologic features included erythema multiforme-like lesions with extensive skin sloughing in various regions of the head, neck, and trunk and mucosal involvement. Her Nikolsky sign was negative, and she had no evidence of lesions on areas of skin trauma. Four weeks prior, she had been initiated on hydroxychloroquine for a presumed diagnosis of cutaneous sarcoidosis. Three punch biopsies of the head and neck area revealed subcorneal pustules consistent with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Treatment began with high doses of methylprednisolone, leading to only minimal improvement of existing areas and ongoing spread to new areas. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin was initiated, at which point disease stability was achieved. The patient's rash ultimately resolved, as did her cutaneous pain and pruritus. CONCLUSIONS: Among many potential adverse reactions involving hydroxychloroquine, cutaneous side effects are varied and can lead to significant morbidity or even death. The drug is currently being investigated in a multitude of trials for coronavirus disease2019 treatment, prevention, and prophylaxis after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis is a rare side effect of hydroxychloroquine, and even fewer cases demonstrate histologic evidence of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis while clinically presenting with Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Patients who develop Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis require best supportive care with aggressive fluid and electrolyte replacement and prevention of further breakdown of the skin barrier. With the potential of widespread hydroxychloroquine use, it is important that providers be aware of its potential severe adverse drug reactions.","Coleman, Ivorie; Ruiz, Gabriel; Brahmbhatt, Sumir; Ackerman, Lindsay",J Med Case Rep,565,12

We developed a twofold framework in this study, which is composed by one novel descriptive model to depict the recurrent global outbreaks of COVID-19 and one dynamic model to understand the intrinsic mechanisms of recurrent outbreaks. We used publicly available data of cumulative infected cases from 1 January 2020 to 2 January 2021 in 30 provinces in China and 43 other countries around the world for model validation and further analyses. These time series data could be well fitted by the new descriptive model. Through this quantitative approach, we discovered two main mechanisms that strongly correlate with the extent of the recurrent outbreak: the sudden increase in cases imported from overseas and the relaxation of local government epidemic prevention policies. The compartmental dynamical model (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Dead and Recovered (SEIDR) Model) could reproduce the obvious recurrent outbreak of the epidemics and showed that both imported infected cases and the relaxation of government policies have a causal effect on the emergence of a new wave of outbreak, along with variations in the temperature index. Meanwhile, recurrent outbreaks affect consumer confidence and have a significant influence on GDP. These results support the necessity of policies such as travel bans, testing of people upon entry, and consistency of government prevention and control policies in avoiding future waves of epidemics and protecting economy.","Han, Chuanliang; Li, Meijia; Haihambo, Naem; Babuna, Pius; Liu, Qingfang; Zhao, Xixi; Jaeger, Carlo; Li, Ying; Yang, Saini",Nonlinear Dyn,565,22

Virus infection requires the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Although studies have demonstrated anti-spike and -RBD antibodies to be protective in animal models, and convalescent plasma as a promising therapeutic option, little is known about immunoglobulin isotypes capable of blocking infection. METHODS: We studied spike- and RBD-specific immunoglobulin isotypes in convalescent and acute plasma/serum samples using a multiplex bead assay. We also determined virus neutralization activities in plasma and serum samples, and purified immunoglobulin fractions using a vesicular stomatitis pseudovirus assay. RESULTS: Spike- and RBD-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) M, IgG1, and IgA1 were produced by all or nearly all subjects at variable levels and detected early after infection. All samples displayed neutralizing activity. Regression analyses revealed that IgM and IgG1 contributed most to neutralization, consistent with IgM and IgG fractions' neutralization potency. IgA also exhibited neutralizing activity, but with lower potency. CONCLUSION: IgG, IgM, and IgA are critical components of convalescent plasma used for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Klingler, Jéromine; Weiss, Svenja; Itri, Vincenza; Liu, Xiaomei; Oguntuyo, Kasopefoluwa Y; Stevens, Christian; Ikegame, Satoshi; Hung, Chuan-Tien; Enyindah-Asonye, Gospel; Amanat, Fatima; Baine, Ian; Arinsburg, Suzanne; Bandres, Juan C; Kojic, Erna Milunka; Stoever, Jonathan; Jurczyszak, Denise; Bermudez-Gonzalez, Maria; Nádas, Arthur; Liu, Sean; Lee, Benhur; Zolla-Pazner, Susan; Hioe, Catarina E",J Infect Dis,565,29

Thus, a range of different strategies are needed to facilitate the achievement of SDG 2 to overcome challenges and enable synergies between various SDG targets. Objective: The aim of this review is to highlight Africa's progress toward SDG 2, including targets, strategies, synergies and challenges. Methods: We scrutinized published research articles in peer-reviewed journals, UN reports and in-country Africa reports (between 2015 and 2020) that were relevant to the current topic. Results: Several hunger indicators are showing slow progress or even deterioration in Africa. The prevalence of undernourishment in the general population was 19.1% in 2019 and is expected to increase to 25.7% by 2030. Improvements in child stunting in several regions in Africa are slow, especially in sub-Saharan Africa where about 34% of under-fives were stunted in 2012 and 31% in 2019. In Eastern Africa, stunting prevalence decreased from 38% in 2012 to 34% in 2019. Major drivers of hunger are poor governance and state fragility, war and conflicts, increasing inequality, weak economic development, climate change, biodegradation - and now lately the Covid 19 pandemic - factors that all increase food insecurity. Conclusion: Africa is off track to reach SDG -'Zero Hunger' - by 2030. Current efforts and progress are insufficient. Africa must champion the SDG agenda on a national, regional and global level to facilitate synergies to unlock the potential for reaching 'Zero Hunger' throughout the continent.","Atukunda, P.; Eide, W.

Findings revealed that one individual level factor, such as individual resilience, and two family level factors, such as safety at home and being a parent, negatively influenced psychological distress. On the other hand, a family level factor, family's financial difficulties, positively predicted psychological distress. Societal level factor such as national resilience, but not the community level factor, community resilience, positively predicted psychological distress in Filipino adults.

No network meta-analyses have examined the effects of psychotherapy compared with pharmacotherapy, combined treatment, care as usual, and other control conditions among patients in primary care. METHODS: We conducted systematic searches of bibliographic databases to identify randomized trials comparing psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy, combined treatment, care as usual, waitlist, and pill placebo. The main outcome was treatment response (50% improvement of depressive symptoms from baseline to end point). RESULTS: A total of 58 studies with 9,301 patients were included. Both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy were significantly more effective than care as usual (relative risk [RR] for response = 1.60; 95% CI, 1.40-1.83 and RR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.35-2.03, respectively) and waitlist (RR = 2.35; 95% CI, 1.57-3.51 and RR = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.57-3.74, respectively) control groups. We found no significant differences between psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy (RR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.88-1.22). The effects were significantly greater for combined treatment compared with psychotherapy alone (RR = 1.35; 95% CI, 1.00-1.81). The difference between combined treatment and pharmacotherapy became significant when limited to studies with low risk of bias and studies limited to cognitive behavior therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Psychotherapy is likely effective for the treatment of depression when compared with care as usual or waitlist, with effects comparable to those of pharmacotherapy. Combined treatment might be better than either psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy alone.","Cuijpers, Pim; Oud, Matthijs; Karyotaki, Eirini; Noma, Hisashi; Quero, Soledad; Cipriani, Andrea; Arroll, Bruce; Furukawa, Toshi A",Ann Fam Med,565,16

Polyaniline (PANI) has been prepared by the chemical oxidative polymerization method and incorporated with ZnO nanoflowers by the chemisorption method. The potential of the synthesized nanostructures has been demonstrated for efficient photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) and photoelectrochemical water splitting. The PANI/ZnO nanocomposite has exhibited the enhanced photocatalytic activity which is ~9 fold higher in comparison to pristine ZnO nanoflowers and enhanced photocurrent density which is ~16 fold higher than the ZnO photoanode. Importantly, ~4 fold increment in the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is exhibited by PANI/ZnO, than that of ZnO photoanode. The remarkably enhanced photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical performance of PANI/ZnO nanocomposite is attributed to the availability of more interfacial sites facilitated by the hierarchical ZnO nanoflowers, improved overall photoresponse due to its photosensitization with PANI and the resulting type-II heterojunction between them, which helps in the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers at the interface.

It is an unprecedented challenge for society. Frontline medical staff are at high risk of mental health problems due to the overwhelming workload, worry of infection, and inadequate protective instruments. The study is to investigate the psychological status of medical staff in a women and children's hospital in non-epicenter of COVID-19 during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A total of 2,143 hospital medical staff participated in a cross-sectional online survey. Psychological response levels were assessed using the Psychological Questionnaire on Emergency Events in Public Health (PQEEPH), and mental health status was measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale. RESULTS: Eligible responses were received from 1,890 (90.6%) women and 197 (9.4%) men. In total, 10.3% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe, and 4% reported severe anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that the majority of the medical staff are in great level of mental health. The study demonstrates that females, the 31-40 age group, and those who have been widowed experienced greater levels of anxiety and therefore require more support. Furthermore, the cognition of medical workers might affect their emotional reactions. Measures to decrease anxiety during emergency outbreaks should therefore include communication strategies.","Zhang, Ling; Wang, Shiping; Shen, Jing; Wang, Ying; Huang, Xiuhua; Wu, Fang; Zheng, Xingli; Zeng, Ping; Qiu, Dan",Ann Palliat Med,565,1

METHODS: Cross-sectional study was conducted among 384 pregnant mothers at southwest Ethiopia from August 1, 2020, to August 15, 2020. Participants were included by consecutive sampling. Quality of life was assessed by short version of WHO quality of life. Social support and fear of COVID-19 were evaluated by Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and fear of COVID-19 scale (FCoV-19S), respectively. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 23.0. Frequency and percentage for categorical variables, and mean ± SD for continuous variables were calculated. Independent sample t test and ANOVA were employed to compare the groups of normally distributed variables. Multiple regressions were performed, and Pearson correlation (r) was used to explore the relationships. Statistical significance was declared at p < .05, and 95% CI was calculated. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 31.3 ± 7.7, and 40.4% of them were between the ages of 25-34. The mean scores of participants those living with <5 family members and those living with &#8805;5 family members were significantly different [t(382) = 3.09, p = .002]. Participants with primary education have significantly high mean score of WHOQOL-BREF from those participants with no formal education (p = .028, MD = -1.9). Moderate negative correlation was observed between the scores of WHOQOL-BREF and FCoV-19S. All the components of MSPSS had positively associated with WHOQOL-BREF score at significant level. On final model, FCoV-19S score has uniquely accounted for 19.4% of variance in WHOQOL-BREF. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived social support has positively linked to QOL among pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic-related fear has negative association with QOL and may be considered independent contributor of decreased quality of life in this population.","Dule, Aman; Hajure, Mohammedamin; Mohammedhussein, Mustefa; Abdu, Zakir",Brain Behav,565,1

Design/methodology/approach This research is of a qualitative nature. The thematic exploration uses the analysis of findings from 19 in-depth interviews with experienced HR managers and is preceded by desk research. Findings The findings advance our understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected developmental processes in organisations. The results indicate, apart from the change in the form and methodology of employee trainings due to the pandemic, that employees also desire new subjects to aid their development. One also noticed decreased employee engagement and increased fatigue with the use of multiple, online development initiatives. Practical implications For learning and development (L&D) practitioners, there are implications in relation to tailoring developmental offerings to fit the needs of employees to help them to progress more in the course of their work. In this new reality, an agile approach to employee development can work much better. The activities of the L&D departments should also take into greater account the changing and unpredictable reality as well as the evolving nature of information and communication technologies (ICT). The COVID-19 pandemic may contribute to the analysis and modernisation of existing offerings for development in organisations and foster a culture of lifelong learning. Originality/value This research makes an important contribution to the literature by examining the impact of situational context on modifications in development activities undertaken in organisations. The results indicate the need to change the existing role of L&D teams in organisations, taking into account the maximum use of e-learning potential, while understanding its limitations. It can be assumed that while the pandemic develops, designing hybrid learning will become even more important and L&D professionals will focus on combining the flexibility of self-training and available online resources with highly engaging real-world experiences.","Mikolajczyk, K.",European Journal of Training and Development,565,23

We genetically characterized the clinical isolate Enterobacter roggenkampii OIPH-N260, which harbored carbapenemase genes blaIMP-1 and blaGES-5 with multiple resistance genes, including mcr-9 and blaCTX-M-9. METHODS: This isolate was characterized by whole-genome sequencing, comparative analysis of resistance plasmids, susceptibility tests, bacterial conjugation, S1-nuclease digested pulsed-field-gel electrophoresis, and Southern blot hybridization. RESULTS: The OIPH-N260 isolate exhibited resistance to most ß-lactams and colistin. It co-harbored two resistance plasmids, the blaIMP-1- and blaGES-5-encoding IncP6 plasmid pN260-3 and mcr-9- and blaCTX-M-9-encoding IncHI2 plasmid pN260-1. The comparative analysis of pN260-3 indicated that a unique blaIMP-1-surrounding region was inserted into the blaGES-5-encoding plasmid with the mobile element IS26, which plays an important role in the spread of resistance genes. pN260-1 did not possess the mcr-9 expression regulative gene qseBC. Both plasmids were transferable into other bacterial species via conjugation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report not only a blaIMP-1 and blaGES-5 co-encoding plasmid, but also the co-harboring of another plasmid carrying mcr-9 and blaCTX-M-9 in E. cloacae complex. The development of advanced resistance via IS26-mediated insertion and the co-harboring of resistance plasmids highlights the need to monitor for resistance genes in CPE.","Umeda, Kaoru; Nakamura, Hiromi; Fukuda, Akira; Matsumoto, Yuki; Motooka, Daisuke; Nakamura, Shota; Yasui, Yoshinori; Yoshida, Hideki; Kawahara, Ryuji",J.

Currently, drugs that were effective against SARS-CoV are being repurposed for SARS-CoV-2. During this public health emergency, food nutraceuticals could be promising prophylactic therapeutics for COVID-19. Curcumin, a bioactive compound in turmeric, exerts diverse pharmacological activities and is widely used in foods and traditional medicines. This review presents several lines of evidence, which suggest curcumin as a promising prophylactic, therapeutic candidate for COVID-19. First, curcumin exerts antiviral activity against many types of enveloped viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, by multiple mechanisms: direct interaction with viral membrane proteins;disruption of the viral envelope;inhibition of viral proteases;induce host antiviral responses. Second, curcumin protects from lethal pneumonia and ARDS via targeting NF-B, inflammasome, IL-6 trans signal, and HMGB1 pathways. Third, curcumin is safe and well-tolerated in both healthy and diseased human subjects. In conclusion, accumulated evidence indicates that curcumin may be a potential prophylactic therapeutic for COVID-19 in the clinic and public health settings.","Thimmulappa, R.

METHODS: The COVID-19 Imaging Registry Study Aachen (COVID-19-Bildgebungs-Register Aachen, COBRA) collects data on imaging in patients with COVID-19. Two of the COBRA partner hospitals (RWTH Aachen University Hospital and Dueren Hospital) systematically perform reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs as well as LDCT in all patients presenting with manifestations that are compatible with COVID-19. In accordance with the COV-RADS protocol, the LDCT scans were prospectively evaluated before the RT-PCR findings were available in order to categorize the likelihood of COVID-19. RESULTS: From 18 March to 5 May 2020, 191 patients with COVID-19 manifestations (117 male, age 65 ± 16 years) underwent RT-PCR testing and LDCT. The mean time from the submission of the sample to the availability of the RT-PCR findings was 491 minutes (interquartile range [IQR: 276-1066]), while that from the performance of the CT to the availability of its findings was 9 minutes (IQR: 6-11). A diagnosis of COVID-19 was made in 75/191 patients (39%). The LDCT was positive in 71 of these 75 patients and negative in 106 of the 116 patients without COVID-19, corresponding to 94.7% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [86.9; 98.5]), 91.4% specificity [84.7; 95.8], positive and negative predictive values of 87.7% [78.5; 93.9] and 96.4% [91.1; 98.6], respectively, and an AUC (area under the curve) of 0.959 [0.930; 0.988]. The initial RT-PCR test results were falsely negative in six patients, yielding a sensitivity of 92.0% [83.4; 97.0]; these six patients had positive LDCT findings. 47.4% of the LDCTs that were negative for COVID-19 (55/116) exhibited pathological pulmonary changes, including infiltrates, that were correctly distinguished from SARS-CoV-2 related changes. CONCLUSION: In patients with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, LDCT can esablish the diagnosis of COVID-19 with comparable sensitivity to RT-PCR testing. In addition, it offers a high specificity for distinguishing COVID-19 from other diseases associated with the same or similar clinical symptoms. We propose the systematic use of LDCT in addition to RT-PCR testing because it helps correct false-negative RT-PCR results, because its results are available much faster than those of RT-PCRtesting, and because it provides additional diagnostic information useful for treatment planning regardless of the type of the infectious agent.","Schulze-Hagen, Maximilian; Hübel, Christian; Meier-Schroers, Michael; Yüksel, Can; Sander, Anton; Sähn, Marwin; Kleines, Michael; Isfort, Peter; Cornelissen, Christian; Lemmen, Sebastian; Marx, Nikolaus; Dreher, Michael; Brokmann, Jörg; Kopp, Andreas; Kuhl, Christiane",Dtsch Arztebl Int,565,10

This paper examines the HIV situation, assesses the gaps, and analyses what it would take the region to end AIDS by 2030. Political will and commitments for ending AIDS must be reaffirmed and reinforced. Focused regional strategic direction that answers the specific regional context and guides countries to respond to their specific needs must be put in place. The region must harness the power of innovative tools and technology in both prevention and treatment. Community activism and meaningful community engagement across the spectrum of HIV response must be ensured. Punitive laws, stigma, and discrimination that deter key populations and people living with HIV from accessing health services must be effectively tackled. The people-centred public health approach must be fully integrated into national universal health coverage while ensuring domestic resources are available for community-led service delivery. The region must utilise its full potential and draw upon lessons that have been learnt to address common challenges of the HIV and COVID-19 pandemics and achieve the goal of ending AIDS by 2030, in fulfillment of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.","Murphy, Eamonn; Shwe, Ye Yu; Bhatia, Reeta; Bakkali, Taoufik; Vannakit, Ravipa",Sex Health,565,1

The virus contains a large genome that encodes four structural proteins, small envelope (E), matrix (M), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), spike (S), and 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) that together, ensure replication of the virus in the host cell. Among these proteins, the interactions of N and Nsp3 are essential that links the viral genome for processing. The N proteins reside at CoV RNA synthesis sites known as the replication-transcription complexes (RTCs). The N-terminal of N has RNA-binding domain (N-NTD), capturing the RNA genome while the C-terminal domain (N-CTD) anchors the viral Nsp3, a component of RTCs. Although the structural information has been recently released, the residues involved in contacts between N-CTD with Nsp3 are still unknown.

Little data exists on COVID-19 incidences and risk mitigation strategies in youth club sports. OBJECTIVE: To determine the reported incidence of COVID-19 cases among youth club sport athletes and the information sources used to develop COVID-19 risk mitigation procedures. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Online surveys. PATIENTS: Soccer and volleyball youth club directors. INTERVENTION: A survey was completed by directors of youth volleyball and soccer clubs across the country in October 2020. Surveys included self-reported date of re-initiation, number of players, player COVID-19 cases, sources of infection, COVID-19 mitigation strategies, and information sources for the development of COVID-19 mitigation strategies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total number of cases reported, number of players, and days since club re-initiation were used to calculate an incidence rate of cases per 100,000 player-days. To compare reported incidence rates between soccer and volleyball, a negative binomial model was developed to predict player cases with sport and state incidence as covariates and log(player-days) as an offset. Estimates were exponentiated to yield a reported incidence rate ratio (IRR) with Wald confidence intervals. RESULTS: A total of 205,136 athletes (soccer=165,580; volleyball=39,556) were represented by 437 clubs (soccer=159; volleyball=278). Club organizers reported 673 COVID-19 cases (soccer=322; volleyball=351), for a reported incidence rate of 2.8 cases per 100,000 player-days (soccer=1.7, volleyball=7.9). Volleyball had a significantly higher reported COVID-19 incidence rate compared to soccer (reported IRR = 3.06 [2.0-4.6], p<0.001). Out of 11 possible mitigation strategies, the median number of strategies used by all clubs was 7 with an interquartile range of 2. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of self-reported cases of COVID-19 was lower in soccer clubs than volleyball clubs. Most clubs report using many COVID-19 mitigation strategies to reduce the risk of COVID-19.","Biese, Kevin M; McGuine, Timothy A; Haraldsdottir, Kristin; Goodavish, Leslie; Watson, Andrew M",J. athl. train,565,24

This has also paved the way to identify the targets for drug repurposing as a therapeutic alternative. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set in motion more than 500 drug development programs on an emergency basis, most of them are focusing on repurposed drugs. Remdesivir is one such success of a robust and quick drug repurposing approach.

As social distancing measures continue during the COVID-19 pandemic, experts encourage individuals with underlying conditions to engage in telehealth appointments to maintain continuity of care while minimizing risk exposure. To date, however, little information has been provided regarding telehealth uptake among this high-risk population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe the telehealth use, resource needs, and information sources of individuals with chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary objectives include exploring differences in telehealth use by sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: Data for this study were collected through an electronic survey distributed between May 12-14, 2020, to members of 26 online health communities for individuals with chronic disease. Descriptive statistics were run to explore telehealth use, support needs, and information sources, and z tests were run to assess differences in sociodemographic factors and information and support needs among those who did and did not use telehealth services. RESULTS: Among the 2210 respondents, 1073 (49%) reported engaging in telehealth in the past 4 months. Higher proportions of women engaged in telehealth than men (890/1781, 50% vs 181/424, 43%; P=.007), and a higher proportion of those earning household incomes of more than US $100,000 engaged in telehealth than those earning less than US $30,000 (195/370, 53% vs 241/530 45%; P=.003). Although 59% (133/244) of those younger than 40 years and 54% (263/486) of those aged 40-55 years used telehealth, aging populations were less likely to do so, with only 45% (677/1500) of individuals 56 years or older reporting telehealth use (P<.001 and P=.001, respectively). Patients with cystic fibrosis, lupus, and ankylosing spondylitis recorded the highest proportions of individuals using telehealth when compared to those with other diagnoses. Of the 2210 participants, 1333 (60%) participants either looked up information about the virus online or planned to in the future, and when asked what information or support would be most helpful right now, over half (1151/2210, 52%) responded ""understanding how COVID-19 affects people with my health condition."" CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of the study sample reported participating in telehealth in the past 4 months. Future efforts to engage individuals with underlying medical conditions in telehealth should focus on outreach to men, members of lower-income households, and aging populations. These results may help inform and refine future health communications to further engage this at-risk population in telehealth as the pandemic continues.","Horrell, Lindsey Nicole; Hayes, Sara; Herbert, Leslie Beth; MacTurk, Katie; Lawhon, Lauren; Valle, Carmina G; Bhowmick, Amrita",J Med Internet Res,565,26

Several doubts arise about the role of asymptomatic carriers in virus transmission. During the first epidemic outbreak in Italy a large screening with nasopharyngeal swab (NS) was performed in those who were considered 'suspect' for infection. AIMS: To report the results of the SARS-CoV-2 screening in a province in Southern Italy and to provide data on the COVID-19 epidemic and the burden of asymptomatic subjects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was set up in all healthcare facilities of the province (12 hospitals and 13 sanitary districts: primary, secondary and tertiary centres) with the aim to analyse the results of NS performed on all subjects suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, either because they presented symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were 'contacts' of positive subjects, they came from areas with high prevalence or they were healthcare workers. NS were performed and managed as indicated by international guidelines. The specimens were processed for SARS-CoV-2 detection by real-time PCR. RESULTS: A total of 20 325 NS were performed from 13 March to 9 May 2020. Of these, 638 (3.14%) were positive. 470 were asymptomatic, or 75.3% of persons who were positive. They were mostly among 'contacts' of symptomatic cases (428 of 470, 91%) and were in domiciliary isolation. Expression of three SARS-CoV-2 genes did not differ between asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects. The strict measures with regard to social distancing led to a continuous decrease in cases during phase 1. CONCLUSIONS: In a large area in Southern Italy, 3.14% (638 of 20 325) of the total subjects tested were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Most of them were asymptomatic (470 of 624, 75.3%), and of these 91% (428 of 470) were 'close contacts' of symptomatic subjects. The combination of social distancing together with the systematic screening of close contacts of COVID-19-positive symptomatic subjects seems to be an efficacious approach to limit the spread of the epidemic.","Masarone, Mario; Vaccaro, Emilia; Sciorio, Roberta; Torre, Pietro; Della Vecchia, Antonio; Aglitti, Andrea; Caliulo, Rita; Borrelli, Anna; Persico, Marcello",BMJ Open,565,1

Antiinflammatory corticosteroids targeting the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) are the current standard of care but drive adverse side effects such as deleterious bone loss. Through subtle modification to a steroidal backbone, a recently developed drug, vamorolone, appears to preserve beneficial efficacy but with significantly reduced side effects. We use combined structural, biophysical, and biochemical approaches to show that loss of a receptor-ligand hydrogen bond drives these remarkable therapeutic effects. Moreover, vamorolone uniformly weakens coactivator associations but not corepressor associations, implicating partial agonism as the main driver of its dissociative properties. Additionally, we identify a critical and evolutionarily conserved intramolecular network connecting the ligand to the coregulator binding surface. Interruption of this allosteric network by vamorolone selectively reduces GR-driven transactivation while leaving transrepression intact. Our results establish a mechanistic understanding of how vamorolone reduces side effects, guiding the future design of partial agonists as selective GR modulators with an improved therapeutic index.","Liu, Xu; Wang, Yashuo; Gutierrez, Jennifer S; Damsker, Jesse M; Nagaraju, Kanneboyina; Hoffman, Eric P; Ortlund, Eric A",Proc.

In a cohort of 100 patients with cancer who were hospitalized for COVID-19, patients with hematologic cancer had higher mortality relative to patients with solid cancer. In two additional cohorts, flow cytometric and serologic analyses demonstrated that patients with solid cancer and patients without cancer had a similar immune phenotype during acute COVID-19, whereas patients with hematologic cancer had impairment of B cells and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibody responses. Despite the impaired humoral immunity and high mortality in patients with hematologic cancer who also have COVID-19, those with a greater number of CD8 T cells had improved survival, including those treated with anti-CD20 therapy. Furthermore, 77% of patients with hematologic cancer had detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses. Thus, CD8 T cells might influence recovery from COVID-19 when humoral immunity is deficient. These observations suggest that CD8 T cell responses to vaccination might provide protection in patients with hematologic cancer even in the setting of limited humoral responses.","Bange, Erin M; Han, Nicholas A; Wileyto, Paul; Kim, Justin Y; Gouma, Sigrid; Robinson, James; Greenplate, Allison R; Hwee, Madeline A; Porterfield, Florence; Owoyemi, Olutosin; Naik, Karan; Zheng, Cathy; Galantino, Michael; Weisman, Ariel R; Ittner, Caroline A G; Kugler, Emily M; Baxter, Amy E; Oniyide, Olutwatosin; Agyekum, Roseline S; Dunn, Thomas G; Jones, Tiffanie K; Giannini, Heather M; Weirick, Madison E; McAllister, Christopher M; Babady, N Esther; Kumar, Anita; Widman, Adam J; DeWolf, Susan; Boutemine, Sawsan R; Roberts, Charlotte; Budzik, Krista R; Tollett, Susan; Wright, Carla; Perloff, Tara; Sun, Lova; Mathew, Divij; Giles, Josephine R; Oldridge, Derek A; Wu, Jennifer E; Alanio, Cécile; Adamski, Sharon; Garfall, Alfred L; Vella, Laura A; Kerr, Samuel J; Cohen, Justine V; Oyer, Randall A; Massa, Ryan; Maillard, Ivan P; Maxwell, Kara N; Reilly, John P",Nat Med,565,23

The aim of the study: To determine the frequency of people who assume they got, “Corona-like illness” before WHO announcement of the disease. Describe their demography and character of the disease. Material and Methods: This cross-sectional web-based anonymous survey study included participants who were fulfilling online designed questionnaire. Results: Most of the individuals that fill the questionnaire were in the age group (31-40 years old), most of them were from Egypt 91.5%, 10.7% were smokers, 6.7% of them with cardiac – hypertension and myocardial ischemia, 47.9% of them with allergic rhinitis and 23.4% with asthma. In total, 55.2% of those who fill the questionnaire have the experience of symptoms like coronavirus symptoms in October, November and early December. About 25.9% need to be admitted to ER. Conclusion: Many people may have experienced the disease before the announcement of WHO, especially that the new virus spreads as easily as “Flu”. This may explain the spread of the disease among the families as it is very difficult to stop influenza transmission. The antibodies testing would allow us to check blood samples for antibodies against coronavirus to tell whether remote immunity is found in the population or not.","Mohamed-Hussein, Aliae A.

We estimated dynamic panel data models with controls for macroeconomic setting using general method of moments estimation. The study found that the COVID-19 outbreak led to increases in food prices of the sampled countries. Restrictions on movements or lockdowns in the wake of COVID-19 was associated with an increase in the price of maize only. We also found that exchange rate, inflation and crude oil prices exerted a detrimental effect on food prices. We recommend that governments of SSA countries invest in infrastructure that improves efficiencies in the food supply chain during pandemics. Providing adequate support to industries in the value chain will also improve food availability and food price stability post-COVID-19.","Agyei, Samuel Kwaku Isshaq Zangina Frimpong Siaw Adam Anokye Mohammed Bossman Ahmed Asiamah Oliver",African Development Review,565,18

Viperin is one of the innate antiviral proteins that exert broad-spectrum antiviral effects by various mechanisms. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus that causes huge losses to the pig industry. Research on early antiviral responses in the gastrointestinal tract is essential for developing strategies to prevent the spread of PEDV. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of viperin in PEDV-infected IPEJ-C2 cells. Increased expression of interferon and viperin and decreased replication of PEDV with a clear reduction in the viral load were observed in PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells. Amino acids 1-50 of porcine viperin contain an endoplasmic reticulum signal sequence that allows viperin to be anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum and are necessary for its function in inhibiting PEDV proliferation. The interaction of the viperin S-adenosylmethionine domain with the N protein of PEDV was confirmed via confocal laser scanning microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation. This interaction might interfere with viral replication or assembly to reduce virus proliferation. Our results highlight a potential mechanism whereby viperin is able to inhibit PEDV replication and play an antiviral role in innate immunity.","Wu, Jiaqi; Chi, Heng; Fu, Yali; Cao, Aiping; Shi, Jingxuan; Zhu, Min; Zhang, Lilin; Hua, Deping; Huang, Jinhai",Arch. virol,565,20

This study dealt with the perceptions of students and teachers about the use of Multiple Attempts Format (MAF) in online assessments and how it addresses concerns in academic honesty. The Perceptions on MAF and Academic Honesty Questionnaire (PMAHQ) served as the main instrument. Of the 545 students who responded to the survey, 89% agreed and strongly agreed that MAF addresses concerns on academic honesty. They strongly agreed that through MAF, they are able to improve their scores in online assessments honestly, and that MAF strengthens their academic honesty. Relatedly, 100% of the 10 teachers who responded to the survey hold very positive perception on MAF. They strongly agreed that MAF teaches students about responsibility, making decisions, and taking risks to improve their scores. They also strongly agreed that because MAF provides students with immediate feedback (shows student's score in the previous attempt), it therefore helps the students decide if they will take the next attempt or not, to improve their scores.

The limitation of extant literature in assessing a comprehensive COVID-19 portfolio that accounts for complexities in the spread and containment of the virus underscores this study. We investigate the effect of city-to-city air pollutant species, meteorological conditions, underlying health conditions, socio-economic and demographic factors on COVID-19 health outcomes. We utilize a panel estimation of 615 cities in 6 continents from January 1 to June 11, 2020. While social distancing measures, movement restrictions and lockdown are reported to have improved environmental quality, we show that ambient PM2.5 remains unhealthy and above the acceptable threshold in several countries. Our empirical assessment shows that while ambient PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, pressure, dew, Windgust, and windspeed increase the spread of COVID-19, high relative humidity and ambient temperature have mitigation effect on COVID-19, hence, decreases the number of confirmed cases. We report 66.3% of countries projected to experience a second wave of COVID-19 if government stringency and safety protocols are not enhanced. By extension, our assessments demonstrate that several factors namely underlying health conditions, meteorological, air pollution, health system quality, socio-economic and demographics spur the reproduction effect of COVID-19 across countries.

We hypothesized that early altered liver biochemistries at admission might have different clinical relevance than subsequent changes during hospitalization. A single-center retrospective study was conducted on 540 consecutive hospitalized patients, PCR-diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. Liver test abnormalities were defined as the elevation of either gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), above the upper limit of normality set by our laboratory. Linear mixed models (LMM) evaluated longitudinal associations, incorporating all available follow-up laboratory chemistries. By the end of the follow-up period, 502 patients (94.5%) were discharged (109 (20.5%) died). A total of 319 (64.3%) had at least one abnormal liver test result at admission. More prevalent were elevated AST (40.9%) and GGT (47.3%). Abnormalities were not associated with survival but with respiratory complications at admission. Conversely, LMM models adjusted for age and sex showed that longitudinal increases during hospitalization in ferritin, GGT, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), as well as a decreased albumin levels, were associated with reduced survival. This dual pattern of liver damage might reconcile previous conflicting reports. GGT and ALP trajectories could be useful to determine who might need more surveillance and intensive care.","Bernal-Monterde, Vanesa; Casas-Deza, Diego; Letona-Giménez, Laura; Llama-Celis, Natalia de la; Calmarza, Pilar; Sierra-Gabarda, Olivia; Betoré-Glaria, Elena; Martínez-de, María Lagos; Martínez-Barredo, Lucía; Espinosa-Pérez, María; Arbones-Mainar, Jose M.",Biomedicines,565,24

The aim of this study was to analyze the value of hypoalbuminemia on admission as a predictor of mortality and adverse events in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We analyzed retrospective data from a cohort of 609 consecutive patients, with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, discharged from hospital (deceased or alive). Demographic characteristics, previous comorbidities, symptoms and laboratory findings on admission were collected. Comorbidities were assessed by Charlson-Age Comorbidity Index. RESULTS: Hypoalbuminemia on admission (<34g/L) was more frequent in nonsurvivors than survivors (65.6% vs. 38%, p<0.001) and was significantly associated with the development of sepsis, macrophage activation syndrome, acute heart failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney injury, regardless of Charlson-Age Comorbidity Index.

Internal discussions have mostly been conventional, and familiar sociological theory and methodology seem inadequate to this situation. Taking the viewpoint of the virus helps to shift perspective on a historical moment where a deadly threat is enabled by megacities, mass air travel, callous and corrupt regimes, and the undermining of public services. In this conjuncture sociology, with other social sciences, is under threat. But we can contribute to responses that mobilize community resources to deal with a social/biological crisis, and prepare for the others that will certainly come.","Connell, Raewyn",J. Sociol.,565,16

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Internal Medicine Society and Group of Systemic Autoimmune disease conducted a telematic survey of patients with SAD to learn about the characteristics of COVID-19 in this population. RESULTS: A total of 2,789 patients answered the survey, of which 28 had a diagnosis of uveitis associated with SAE. The majority (82%) were female and caucasian (82%), with a mean age of 48 years. The most frequent SAEs were Behçet's disease followed by sarcoidosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. 46% of the patients were receiving corticosteroid treatment at a mean prednisone dose of 11 mg/day. Regarding infection, 14 (50%) patients reported symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RT-PCR was performed on the nasopharyngeal smear in two patients and in one of them (4%) it was positive.

This study aims to understand the impact on the initial management of patients with brain tumours by measuring changes to normal multidisciplinary team (MDT) decision making. DESIGN: A prospective survey performed in UK neurosurgical units performed from 23 March 2020 until 24 April 2020. SETTING: Regional neurosurgical units outside London (as the pandemic was more advanced at time of study). PARTICIPANTS: Representatives from all units were invited to collect data on new patients discussed at their MDT meetings during the study period. Each unit decided if management decision for each patient had changed due to COVID-19. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures included number of patients where the decision to undergo surgery changed compared with standard management usually offered by that MDT. Secondary outcome measures included changes in surgical extent, numbers referred to MDT, number of patients denied surgery not receiving any treatment and reasons for any variation across the UK. RESULTS: 18 units (75%) provided information from 80 MDT meetings that discussed 1221 patients. 10.7% of patients had their management changed-the majority (68%) did not undergo surgery and more than half of this group not undergoing surgery had no active treatment. There was marked variation across the UK (0%-28% change in management). Units that did not change management could maintain capacity with dedicated oncology lists. Low volume units were less affected. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has had an impact on patients requiring surgery for malignant brain tumours, with patients receiving different treatments-most commonly not receiving surgery or any treatment at all. The variations show dedicated cancer operating lists may mitigate these pressures.

Despite the documented negative impacts of diseases on tourism demand and people's perceived health risk, researchers have seldom examined the psychological responses of tourists travelling during an infectious disease outbreak. We therefore conducted three studies to examine this key aspect, and our findings indicate that tourists have a strong negative emotional reaction towards disadvantaged tourism-related prices in response to a high (vs low) infectious disease threat. Furthermore, risk aversion acts as an underlying mechanism driving this effect: tourists are more risk aversive under the threat of an infectious disease, which consequently magnifies their negative emotional reaction. At last, theoretical and practical implications of these findings for tourism are discussed.","Zhang, Ke; Hou, Yuansi; Li, Gang",Ann Tour Res,565,26

Simulation can help researchers understand how the model behaves in a controlled setting and can be used to stress the model in different ways before it is exposed to any real data. This improved understanding could be beneficial in epidemiological models, specially when dealing with COVID-19. Unfortunately, few researchers perform any simulations. We present a simulation algorithm that implements a simple agent-based model for disease transmission that works with a standard compartment epidemiological model for COVID-19. Our algorithm can be applied in different parameterizations to reflect several plausible epidemic scenarios. Additionally, we also model how social media information in the form of daily symptom mentions can be incorporate into COVID-19 epidemiological models. We test our social media COVID-19 model with two experiments. The first using simulated data from our agent-based simulation algorithm and the second with real data using a machine learning tweet classifier to identify tweets that mention symptoms from noise. Our results shows how a COVID-19 model can be (1) used to incorporate social media data and (2) assessed and evaluated with simulated and real data.","Storopoli, Jose; Santos, Andre Luis Marques Ferreira dos; Pellini, Alessandra Cristina Guedes; Baldwin, Breck",,565,9

Materials and Methods: An online cross-sectional survey using a previously validated questionnaire was used to assess the awareness and knowledge levels of COVID-19 in this study, which was distributed via various online platforms to include as many participants as possible. The study targeted medical doctors, dentists, medical students, and dental students from the GCC region. Participants were at least 18 years old, voluntarily consented to complete the questionnaire, and were assured that their responses would remain anonymous. Permission was obtained using a previously validated and applied questionnaire to assess their level of awareness and knowledge regarding COVID-19. To compare the proportional responses between groups in descriptive statistics, a proportion Z-test was used to find any significant differences, with a statistical significance set at p &lt; 0.05. Results: A total of 1621 participants responded to our questionnaire. Almost two-thirds of the respondents were female (64.4%), and the majority were less than 25 years old (67.2%). Dentists accounted for 12.6% of the total population, and their clinical experience ranged from 0.25 to 52 years (median: 3 years, IQR: 1-10 years). Meanwhile, medical doctors accounted for 24.5% of the responses, and their clinical experience ranged from 0 to 50 years (median: 13 years, IQR: 3-23 years). Among the dental students, 42.3% were in the pre-clinical years, while 57.7% were in the clinical years of study. However, among medical students, 57.5% were in the pre-clinical years, while 42.5% were in the clinical years of study. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that dental students, medical doctors, and medical students exhibited higher odds of having satisfactory COVID-19 perception scores than dentists.","Abdulwahab, M.; Kamal, M.; AlAli, A.

This study aimed to measure the quantity of aerosol released during various dental procedures (caries and prosthetic treatment, debonding of orthodontic brackets, root canal irrigation) while employing the Er:YAG lasers combined with a high-volume evacuator, HVE or salivary ejector, SE. The mandibular second premolar was extracted due to standard orthodontic therapy and placed in a dental manikin, to simulate typical treatment conditions. The particle counter was used to measure the aerosol particles (0.3-10.0 mum) at three different sites: dental manikin and operator's and assistant's mouth area. The study results showed that caries' treatment and dental crown removal with a high-speed handpiece and the use of the SE generated the highest aerosol quantity at each measured site. All three tested Er:YAG lasers significantly reduced the number of aerosol particles during caries' treatment and ceramic crown debonding compared the conventional handpieces, p &lt; 0.05. Furthermore, the Er:YAG lasers generated less aerosol during orthodontic bracket debonding and root canal irrigation in contrast to the initial aerosol quantity measured in the dental office. The use of the Er:YAG lasers during dental treatments significantly generates less aerosol in the dental office setting, which reduces the risk of transmission of viruses or bacteria.","Grzech-Lesniak, K.; Matys, J.",Materials,565,12

This aim of this project was to explore opinions on routine telephone consultations and whether they could be implemented as COVID pressures change. We randomly selected 100 patients who had a telephone consultation instead of their normal urological follow-up and posted them a questionnaire. We also compared the number of consultations and non-attendances with the pre-COVID era. Seventy percent of patients replied to the questionnaire, and 79% wanted to continue with telephone appointments. Eighty-two percent felt that despite COVID-19, their urological care was unaffected. Generally, the reason that telephone appointments were unacceptable for patients was a preference for face-to-face interaction. The majority expressed a lack of enthusiasm for potential video consultations with only 43% interested in this. Over 95% of patients who required investigations still had these tests performed. There was a reduction in patients who 'did not attend (DNAs)' from 7.5% prior to COVID-19 to 3% during the peak of the pandemic.

In response to the virus, many clinics across the world abruptly closed their doors to persons with Parkinson's disease. Fortunately, a niche care model, telemedicine-first described in this journal a generation ago-emerged as the dominant means of providing care. As we adjust to a new normal, we should focus future care not on clinics but on patients. Their needs, guided by clinicians, should determine how care is delivered, whether in the clinic, at home, remotely, or by some combination. Within this patient-centered approach, telemedicine is an attractive care option but not a complete replacement for in-person consultations, which are valuable for specific problems and for those who have access. Now that many clinicians and patients have gained exposure to telemedicine, we can better appreciate its advantages (eg, convenience) and disadvantages (eg, restricted examination). We can also create a new future that utilizes the Internet, video conferencing, smartphones, and sensors. This future will bring many clinicians to one patient, connect individual experts to countless patients, use widely available devices to facilitate diagnosis, and apply novel technologies to measure the disease in new ways. These approaches, which extend to education and research, enable a future where we can care for anyone anywhere and will help us stem the tide of Parkinson's disease. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.","Dorsey, E Ray; Bloem, Bastiaan R; Okun, Michael S",Mov.

It is important to study the intensity of the impact of this pandemic on the profession. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the occupational satisfaction during the pandemic of Covid-19 among the nurses in Israel, to shed light on conditions of work and to identify factors associated with low occupational satisfaction. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 130 Israeli nurses. Minnesota Satisfaction and Measure of Job Satisfaction questionnaire with 28 items was used to assess occupational satisfaction. RESULTS: In the multivariable model, nurses working in the community had higher occupational satisfaction than those working in hospitals (ß = 0.24, p = .032); nurses who took care of patients who tested positive for Covid-19 had significantly lower occupational satisfaction than others (ß = -0.48, p = .009). Most of the sample reported lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). Nurses who experienced lack of PPE reported lower occupational satisfaction than those who did not (3.4 vs. 3.8, p = .039). Occupational satisfaction was mainly based on the component, built by the intrinsic characteristics of the occupation related to the personal accomplishment. Most of nurses had to increase their workload as a result of staff shortages, but the elevation of the workload was not associated with lower occupational satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Even under the circumstances of the pandemic, the most important nurses` occupational values are worthwhile accomplishments, importance of professional challenge, diversity and interest in the job, personal growth and development and independence in their practice.","Savitsky, Bella; Radomislensky, Irina; Hendel, Tova",Appl Nurs Res,565,10

Appropriate age-adjusted D-dimer testing improves D-dimer specificity, could decrease inappropriate CT pulmonary angiograms in the older person, and prevent unnecessary radiation exposure. A “COVID-19 blood battery”, designed to increase the efficiency of evaluation of COVID-19 suspected patients is used in our institution. It includes D-dimers which are elevated in COVID-19 infections and potentially an index of severe infection. These 3 very frail patients presented late to the emergency department, all acutely and non-specifically unwell, with high prevalence of comorbidities and were transferred in by ambulance. They were triaged to the COVID-19 pathway of our hospital, and subsequently had negative COVID-19 swabs. All had an incidental finding of markedly elevated D-dimers, with potential causes of their symptoms other than pulmonary embolus. They were transferred to an acute geriatric ward specifically designated to manage older patients (&gt;75years) who had negative nasopharyngeal swab results. They were all ultimately diagnosed with extensive pulmonary emboli with evidence of raised pulmonary pressures on CTPA and/or echocardiogram. It is possible that these patients had false negative COVID-19 swabs. Allowing for the novel nature of COVID-19, prospective evaluation for new symptoms and complications such as thromboembolic disease in those affected by milder symptoms should be considered. In the absence of clinical improvement following treatment of other conditions in frail older patients, D-dimer testing could be indicated with pursuit of specific diagnostic evaluation for venous thromboembolism when significantly elevated.","O’Brien, Michelle Mary Clare; McLoughlin, J.

In this case report, we present two cases of ischemic enterocolitis in COVID-19 patients and review past case reports. Our literature review has shown that computed tomography rather than endoscopy was used for the diagnosis, and any region of the intestine was affected. Because the elevation of the D-dimer, which suggested a hypercoagulable state, was reported in most cases, we assumed that thrombosis at any level in the artery and vein was involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated enterocolitis.

Further, application of MSCs from several sources such as bone marrow, menstrual blood, and umbilical cord-derived MSCs, which were used in patients suffering from lung injury/ARDS due to conditions other than COVID-19, showed that a dose of up to 1.0 x 107 cells/kg body weight was well tolerated. Conclusion: administration of MSCs to COVID-19 patients showed improvement in clinical symptoms, and a dose up to 1.0 x 107 cells/kg body weight showed tolerance in ARDS patients with moderate to severe conditions. However, the results came from studies with small number of patients, so the results need to be interpreted with caution, and more well design studies with a larger number of patients are needed.","Purwoningsih, E.; Pawitan, J.

It has been argued that identity impairment is one of the core features of BPD, which can be manifested in different ways, including fragmented autobiographical narratives. Here, we considered both the traditional and modern conceptualizations of BPD to examine the relation between identity impairment, as operationalized through autobiographical memory, and features of BPD. We hypothesized that BPD features would be associated with higher levels of fragmentation in narrative identity, narrative intimacy, and narrative coherence in participants' autobiographical memory. To test this hypothesis, we recruited 298 university students who were administered a series of self-report measures of BPD and were asked to describe an autobiographical memory about a turning point in their lives. Narrative identity, but not narrative intimacy nor coherence, was the dominant predictor of BPD features. We discuss our findings in terms of how individuals with features of BPD struggle with many aspects of a distorted sense of self.

We sought to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in the overall screening for acute stroke utilizing a commercial clinical artificial intelligence (AI) platform. Methods: Data were derived from the Viz Platform, an AI application designed to optimize the workflow of acute stroke patients. Neuroimaging data on suspected stroke patients across 97 hospitals in 20 US states were collected in real-time and retrospectively analyzed with the number of patients undergoing imaging screening serving as a surrogate for the amount of stroke care. The main outcome measures were the number of CTA, CTP, Large vessel occlusions (LVOs) (defined according to the automated software detection), and severe strokes on CTP (defined as those with hypoperfusion volumes&gt;70mL) normalized as number of patients per day per hospital. Data from the pre-pandemic (November 4, 2019 to February 29, 2020) and pandemic (March 1 to May 10, 2020) periods were compared at national and state levels. Correlations were made between the inter-period changes in imaging screening, stroke hospitalizations, and thrombectomy procedures using state-specific sampling. Results: A total of 23,223 patients were included. The incidence of LVO on CTA and severe strokes on CTP were 11.2%(n=2,602) and 14.7%(n=1,229/8,328), respectively. There were significant declines in the overall number of CTAs (-22.8%;1.39 to 1.07 patients/day/hospital,p&lt;0.001) and CTPs (-26.1%;0.50 to 0.37 patients/day/hospital,p&lt;0.001) as well as in the incidence of LVO (-17.1%;0.15 to 0.13 patients/day/hospital,p&lt;0.001) and severe strokes on CTP (-16.7%;0.12 to 0.10 patients/day/hospital, p&lt;0.005). The sampled cohort showed similar declines in the rates of LVOs versus thrombectomy (18.8%vs.19.5%, p=0.9) and CSC hospitalizations (18.8%vs.11.0%, p=0.4). Conclusions: A significant decline in stroke imaging screening has occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. This underscores the broader application of AI neuroimaging platforms for the real-time monitoring of stroke systems of care.","Nogueira, R.; Davies, J.; Gupta, R.; Hassan, A. E.; Devlin, T.

The major functions of HSPs include chaperoning misfolded or unfolded polypeptides, protecting cells from toxic stress, and presenting immune and inflammatory cytokines. Regarded as a double-edged sword, HSPs also cooperate with numerous viruses and cancer cells to promote their survival. RNA chaperones are a group of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), which are essential factors for manipulating both the functions and metabolisms of pre-mRNAs/hnRNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II. hnRNPs involve in a large number of cellular processes, including chromatin remodelling, transcription regulation, RNP assembly and stabilization, RNA export, virus replication, histone-like nucleoid structuring, and even intracellular immunity. Dysregulation of stress proteins is associated with many human diseases including human cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's diseases, Alzheimer disease), stroke and infectious diseases. In this review, we summarized the biologic function of stress proteins, and current progress on their mechanisms related to virus reproduction and diseases caused by virus infections. As SPs also attract a great interest as potential antiviral targets (e.g., COVID-19), we also discuss the present progress and challenges in this area of HSP-based drug development, as well as with compounds already under clinical evaluation.","Wan, Qianya; Song, Dan; Li, Huangcan; He, Ming-Liang",Signal Transduct Target Ther,565,15

Specialist services, including clinical genetics, must consider methods of remote delivery including videoconferencing-termed telegenetics. This review evaluates the evidence for telegenetics and its applicability to future service development. METHODS: A systematic review of six databases was conducted to identify studies from 2005 onward using synchronous videoconferencing to deliver clinical genetics services. Included studies compared telegenetics to an alternative method or used a before and after design. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria (eight compared telegenetics to in-person consultations and three to telephone delivery). Patient satisfaction, genetic knowledge, and psychosocial outcomes were similar for in-person and telegenetic counseling. There was some evidence that telegenetics may be superior to telephone delivery for knowledge gain and reduction in anxiety and depression. There is limited evidence concerning the effect of telegenetics on provider satisfaction and behavioral outcomes. Conclusions are limited by at least moderate risk of bias in all evaluated studies and small sample sizes. CONCLUSION: Across most outcomes measured, telegenetics had equivalent outcomes to in-person appointment; however, the extent to which the available evidence is applicable to longer-term use is debatable.","Brown, Elizabeth G; Watts, Isabella; Beales, Emily R; Maudhoo, Ashwini; Hayward, Judith; Sheridan, Eamonn; Rafi, Imran",Genet. med,565,16

Epidemics are well-known to cause mental distress, and patients with a current or past history of obesity are at increased risk for the common presence of psychological comorbidities. This study investigates the psychological impact of the current pandemic in patients participating in a bariatric surgery program. METHODS: Patients were consecutively enrolled during the Italian lockdown among those waiting for bariatric surgery or attending a post-bariatric follow-up, and were asked to complete through an online platform the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 and a self-assessment questionnaire of 22 items evaluating the resilience, change in eating behavior and emotional responses referring to the ongoing pandemic. RESULTS: 59% of the 434 enrolled subjects reported of being worried about the pandemic, and 63% specifically reported of being worried about their or their relatives' health. 37% and 56% felt lonelier and more bored, respectively. 66% was hungrier with increased frequency of snacking (55%) and 39% reported more impulse to eat. Noteworthy, 49% felt unable to follow a recommended diet. No difference in terms of psychological profile was recorded among pre and post-bariatric subjects. Logistic regression analysis on post-bariatric patients showed a relationship between snacking, hunger, eating impulsivity, and anxiety, stress, and/or depression symptoms. CONCLUSION: The pandemic led to increased psychological distress in patients with a current or past history of obesity, reducing quality of life and affecting dietary compliance. Targeted psychological support is warranted in times of increased stress for fragile subjects such as pre- and post-bariatric patients.

There are limited data on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study to compare clinical characteristics and maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: During the period 24 January-29 February 2020, there were 16 pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 18 suspected cases who were admitted to labor in the third trimester. Two had vaginal delivery and the rest were cesarean delivery. Few patients presented respiratory symptoms (fever and cough) on admission, but most had typical chest computed tomographic images of COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared to the controls, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had lower counts of white blood cells (WBCs), neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), and alanine aminotransferase on admission. Increased levels of WBCs, neutrophils, eosinophils, and CRP were found in postpartum blood tests of pneumonia patients. Three (18.8%) of the mothers with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 3 (16.7%) with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia had preterm delivery due to maternal complications, which were significantly higher than in the control group. None experienced respiratory failure during their hospital stay. COVID-19 infection was not found in the newborns, and none developed severe neonatal complications. CONCLUSIONS: Severe maternal and neonatal complications were not observed in pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia who had vaginal or cesarean delivery. Mild respiratory symptoms of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia highlight the need of effective screening on admission.","Li, Na; Han, Lefei; Peng, Min; Lv, Yuxia; Ouyang, Yin; Liu, Kui; Yue, Linli; Li, Qiannan; Sun, Guoqiang; Chen, Lin; Yang, Lin",Clin Infect Dis,565,33

To address these issues and optimize pediatric pulmonary training, a group of faculty from various institutions met in 2019 and proposed specific, long-term solutions to the emerging problems in the field. Input on these ideas was then solicited more broadly from faculty with relevant expertise and from recent trainees. This proposal is a synthesis of these ideas. Pediatric pulmonology was among the first pediatric specialties to be grounded deliberately in science, requiring its fellows to demonstrate expertise in scientific inquiry (1). In the future, we will need more training in science, not less. Specifically, the scope of scientific inquiry will need to be broader. The proposal outlined below is designed to help optimize the practices of current providers and to prepare the next generation to be leaders in pediatric care in the future. We are optimistic that this can be accomplished. Our broad objectives are (a) to meet the pediatric subspecialty workforce demand by increasing interest and participation in pediatric pulmonary training; (b) to modernize training to ensure that future pediatric pulmonologists will be prepared clinically and scientifically for the future of the field; (c) to train pediatric pulmonologists who will add value in the future of pediatric healthcare, complemented by advanced practice providers and artificial intelligence systems that are well-informed to optimize quality healthcare delivery; and (d) to decrease the cost and improve the quality of care provided to children with respiratory diseases.","Gaston, Benjamin; Laguna, Theresa A; Noah, Terry L; Hagood, James; Voynow, Judith; Ferkol, Thomas; Hershenson, Marc; Boyne, Katie; Delecaris, Angela; Ross, Kristie; Gozal, David; Celedón, Juan C; Abman, Steven H; Moore, Paul; Davis, Stephanie; Cornfield, David N; Murphy, Thomas",Pediatr Pulmonol,565,16

Personality traits may predispose people to use adaptive or maladaptive coping strategies that lead to different health-related outcomes. The goal of the present study was to examine whether the use of distinct coping strategies during this stressful COVID-19 outbreak mediates the relationships between Dark Triad (DT) traits and stress, depression, and anxiety. The study was conducted in Poland (N = 1086) and Spain (N = 582), thus cross-culturally validated measures were used to assess depression, anxiety and stress (DASS-21), cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERQ) and socially aversive traits covered by DT (Dirty Dozen scale). The study shows that maladaptive CERS mediates the relationships between narcissism/Machiavellianism and stress, anxiety and depression. Additionally, adaptive CERS mediates the relationship between psychopathy and depression. The results provide a better understanding of the mediating role of CERS on the relationships between DT traits and the stress, anxiety and depression experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mojsa-Kaja, Justyna Szklarczyk Klaudia González-Yubero Sara Palomera Raquel",Personality and Individual Differences,565,0

Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) is a direct-acting antiviral therapy for HCV, approved for 8-week treatment in patients without cirrhosis, and with compensated cirrhosis (CC). Previously, 12 weeks of therapy was recommended for patients with CC. Shortened treatment may reduce the burden on healthcare resources, allowing more patients to be treated. This study presents the benefits that 8-week vs 12-week treatment with G/P may have in Italy. METHODS: A multicohort Markov model was used to assess the collective number of healthcare visits and time on treatment with 8-week vs 12-week G/P in the HCV-infected population of Italy from 2019 to 2030, using healthcare resource data from post-marketing observational studies of G/P. Increased treatment capacity and downstream clinical and economic benefits were also assessed assuming the reallocation of saved healthcare visits to treat more patients. RESULTS: Modeled outcomes showed that by 2030, 8-week treatment saved 27,006 years on therapy compared with 12-week treatment, with 21,065 fewer hepatologist visits. Reallocating these resources to treat more patients could increase capacity to treat 5064 (1.4%) more patients with 8 weeks of G/P, all with CC. This increased treatment capacity would further avoid 2257 cases of end-stage liver disease, 893 liver-related deaths, and provide net savings to the healthcare system of nearly 70 million. CONCLUSION: The modeled comparisons between 8- and 12-week treatment with G/P show that shorter treatment duration can lead to greater time and resource savings, both in terms of healthcare visits and downstream costs. These benefits have the potential to enable the treatment of more patients to overcome elimination barriers in Italy through programs aimed to engage and treat targeted HCV populations.","Andreoni, Massimo; Di Perri, Giovanni; Persico, Marcello; Marcellusi, Andrea; Ethgen, Olivier; Sanchez Gonzalez, Yuri; Bondin, Mark; Zhang, Zhenzhen; De Michina, Antonella; Merolla, Rocco Cosimo Damiano; Craxì, Antonio",,565,26

Severe cases from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale market in Wuhan were confirmed pneumonia with a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Understanding the molecular mechanisms of genome selection and packaging is critical for developing antiviral strategies. Thus, we defined the correlation in 10 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) sequences from different countries to analyze the genomic patterns of disease origin and evolution aiming for developing new control pandemic processes. METHODS: We apply genomic analysis to observe SARS-CoV2 sequences from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/genebank/): MN 908947 (China, C1), MN985325 (USA: WA, UW), MN996527 (China, C2), MT007544 (Australia: Victoria, A1), MT027064 (USA: CA, UC), MT039890 (South Korea, K1), MT066175 (Taiwan, T1), MT066176 (Taiwan, T2), LC528232 (Japan, J1), and LC528233 (Japan, J2) for genomic sequence alignment analysis. Multiple Sequence Alignment by Clustalw (https://www.genome.jp/tools-bin/clustalw) web service is applied as our alignment tool. RESULTS: We analyzed 10 sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database by genome alignment and found no difference in amino acid sequences within M and N proteins. There are two amino acid variances in the spike (S) protein region. One mutation found from the South Korea sequence is verified. Two possible ""L"" and ""S"" SNPs found in ORF1ab and ORF8 regions are detected. CONCLUSION: We performed genomic analysis and comparative multiple sequences of SARS-CoV2. Studies about the biological symptoms of SARS-CoV2 in clinic animals and humans will manipulate an understanding on the origin of pandemic crisis.","Chang, Tai-Jay; Yang, De-Ming; Wang, Mong-Lien; Liang, Kung-How; Tsai, Ping-Hsing; Chiou, Shih-Hwa; Lin, Ta-Hsien; Wang, Chin-Tien",J Chin Med Assoc,565,23

Consensus statements were developed to guide clinicians managing lung cancer screening programs and patients with lung nodules during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: An expert panel of 24 members, including pulmonologists (n = 17), thoracic radiologists (n = 5), and thoracic surgeons (n = 2), was formed. The panel was provided with an overview of current evidence, summarized by recent guidelines related to lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. The panel was convened by video teleconference to discuss and then vote on statements related to 12 common clinical scenarios. A predefined threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree was used to determine if there was a consensus for each statement. Items that may influence decisions were listed as notes to be considered for each scenario. Results: Twelve statements related to baseline and annual lung cancer screening (n = 2), surveillance of a previously detected lung nodule (n = 5), evaluation of intermediate and high-risk lung nodules (n = 4), and management of clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (n = 1) were developed and modified. All 12 statements were confirmed as consensus statements according to the voting results. The consensus statements provide guidance about situations in which it was believed to be appropriate to delay screening, defer surveillance imaging of lung nodules, and minimize nonurgent interventions during the evaluation of lung nodules and stage I non-small cell lung cancer. Conclusion: There was consensus that during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is appropriate to defer enrollment in lung cancer screening and modify the evaluation of lung nodules due to the added risks from potential exposure and the need for resource reallocation. There are multiple local, regional, and patient-related factors that should be considered when applying these statements to individual patient care.© 2020 RSNA; The American College of Chest Physicians, published by Elsevier Inc; and The American College of Radiology, published by Elsevier Inc.","Mazzone, Peter J; Gould, Michael K; Arenberg, Douglas A; Chen, Alexander C; Choi, Humberto K; Detterbeck, Frank C; Farjah, Farhood; Fong, Kwun M; Iaccarino, Jonathan M; Janes, Samuel M; Kanne, Jeffrey P; Kazerooni, Ella A; MacMahon, Heber; Naidich, David P; Powell, Charles A; Raoof, Suhail; Rivera, M Patricia; Tanner, Nichole T; Tanoue, Lynn K; Tremblay, Alain; Vachani, Anil; White, Charles S; Wiener, Renda Soylemez; Silvestri, Gerard A",Radiol Imaging Cancer,565,24

We found that on average, in relative terms, men have increased their contributions at roughly the same rate (by 35 percent) as women. But given that women had been doing a lot more childcare work before the pandemic, in absolute terms, women’s contributions grew significantly more than men’s and the gap between men and women has increased in absolute work hour terms. This was particularly so among a specific group of women: middle class, highly educated city-dwellers.

Our aim was to investigate the value of additional chest CT for detection of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) in patients who undergo head CT for suspected stroke or head trauma in a COVID-19-endemic region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 27 patients (mean age, 74 years; range, 54-90 years; 20 men) who underwent head CT for suspected stroke (n = 21) or head trauma (n = 6), additional chest CT for COVID-19 detection, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing in a COVID-19-endemic region. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 were calculated. RESULTS: Final neurologic diagnoses were ischemic stroke (n = 11), brain contusion (n = 5), nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (n = 2), brain metastasis (n = 1), and no primary neurologic disorder (n = 8). Symptoms of possible COVID-19 infection (ie, fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath) were present in 20 of 27 (74%) patients. Seven of 27 patients (26%) had real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed-COVID-19 infection. Chest CT results were 6 true-positives, 15 true-negatives, 5 false-positives, and 1 false-negative. Diagnostic performance values of chest CT were a sensitivity of 85.7%, specificity of 75.0%, negative predictive value of 93.8%, and positive predictive value of 54.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of additional chest CT is fairly high. However, a negative result does not exclude COVID-19. The positive predictive value is poor. Correlation of chest CT results with epidemiologic history and clinical presentation, along with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, is needed for confirmation.","Kwee, R M; Krdzalic, J; Fasen, B A C M; de Jaegere, T M H",AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,565,16

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is related to the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have caused the previous outbreaks. The papain-like protease (PLpro) is an attractive drug target due to its essential roles in the viral life cycle. As a cysteine protease, PLpro is rich in cysteines and histidines, and their protonation/deprotonation modulates catalysis and conformational plasticity. Here, we report the pKa calculations and assessment of the proton-coupled conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLpros using the recently developed graphical processing unit (GPU)-accelerated implicit-solvent continuous constant pH molecular dynamics method with a new asynchronous replica-exchange scheme, which allows computation on a single GPU card. The calculated pKa's support the catalytic roles of the Cys-His-Asp triad. We also found that several residues can switch protonation states at physiological pH among which is C270/271 located on the flexible blocking loop 2 (BL2) of SARS-CoV-2/CoV PLpro. Simulations revealed that the BL2 can open and close depending on the protonation state of C271/270, consistent with the most recent crystal structure evidence. Interestingly, despite the lack of an analogous cysteine, BL2 in MERS-CoV PLpro is also very flexible, challenging a current hypothesis. These findings are supported by the all-atom fixed-charge simulations and provide a starting point for more detailed studies to assist the structure-based design of broad-spectrum inhibitors against CoV PLpros.","Henderson, Jack A; Verma, Neha; Harris, Robert C; Liu, Ruibin; Shen, Jana",J Chem Phys,565,16

Social distancing alone should have been enough to protect again the virus, yet things have gone very differently, with a big mismatch between theory and practice. What are the reasons? A big problem is that there is no actual social distancing data, and the corresponding people behavior in a pandemic is unknown. We collect the world-first dataset on social distancing during the COVID-19 outbreak, so to see for the first time how people really implement social distancing, identify dangers of the current situation, and find solutions against this and future pandemics. Methods: Using a sensor-based social distancing belt we collected social distance data from people in Italy for over two months during the most critical COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, we investigated if and how wearing various Personal Protection Equipment, like masks, influences social distancing. Results: Without masks, people adopt a counter-intuitively dangerous strategy, a paradox that could explain the relative lack of effectiveness of social distancing. Using masks radically changes the situation, breaking the paradoxical behavior and leading to a safe social distance behavior. In shortage of masks, DIY (Do It Yourself) masks can also be used: even without filtering protection, they provide social distancing protection. Goggles should be recommended for general use, as they give an extra powerful safety boost. Generic Public Health policies and media campaigns do not work well on social distancing: explicit focus on the behavioral problems of necessary mobility are needed.","Marchiori, Massimo",,565,16

In separate blocks of trials, the numerals were presented either in Mandarin or in Arabic number formats. In addition to the standard influence of numerical distance, a significant predictor of performance was the degree of physical similarity between the probe and the standard as depicted in Mandarin. Additionally, competing effects of physical similarity, defined in terms of the Arabic number format, were also found. Critically the size of these different effects of physical similarity varied systematically across individuals such that larger effects of one compensated for smaller effects of the other. It is argued that the data favor accounts of processing that assume that different number formats access different format-specific representations of quantities. Moreover, for Chinese participants the default is to translate numerals into a Mandarin format prior to accessing quantity information. The efficacy of this translation process is itself influenced by a competing tendency to carry out a translation into Arabic format.","Quinlan, Philip T; Cohen, Dale J; Liu, Xingyu",Mem. cogn,565,30

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS)is a critical regulator in the pathogenesis of this disease. We focused on two key RAS enzymes, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), to elucidate the activation of the ACE-angiotensin II (Ang II)-angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT1) axis and the inhibition of the ACE2-angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)]-Mas receptor axis in C57BL/6mice following SiO2 treatment. Silica exposure caused nodule formation, pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix, and impaired lung function in mice. These effects were attenuated by the inhibition of ACE (captopril), blockade of the AT1(losartan), or systemic knockdown of the Ace gene. These effects were exacerbated by the inhibition of ACE2 (MLN-4760), blockade of the Mas (A779), or knockdown of the Ace2 gene. N-Acetyl-Seryl-Asparyl-Lysyl-Proline (Ac-SDKP), an anti-fibrotic peptide, ameliorated the silica-exposure-induced pathological changes by targeting the RAS system by activating the protective ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis and inhibiting the deleterious ACE-Ang II-AT1 axis, thereby exerting a protective effect. This was confirmed in mouse lung type II epithelial cells (MLE-12) pretreated with Ang II and/or gene silencing separately targeting Ace and Ace2.The effects of Ac-SDKP were similar to those produced by Ace gene silencing and were partly attenuated by Ace2 deficiency. These findings suggested that RAS plays critical roles in the pathomechanism of silicosis fibrosis and that Ac-SDKP regulates lung RAS to inhibit EMT in silicotic mice and MLE-12 cells.","Li, Shumin; Li, Yaqian; Zhang, Yi; Li, Shifeng; Zhang, Min; Jin, Fuyu; Wei, Zhongqiu; Yang, Yi; Gao, Xuemin; Mao, Na; Ge, Xingchen; Xu, Hong; Yang, Fang",Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,565,16

During the lockdown, the reduction (&gt;10%) in columnar air pollution compared to a five year baseline, expected to increase incoming solar radiation, was counteracted by a ∼30% enhancement in cloud cover, causing little change in available energy at the surface. More importantly, the delay in winter crop harvesting during the lockdown increased surface vegetation cover, causing almost half the regional cooling via evapotranspiration. Since this cooling was higher for rural areas, the daytime surface urban heat island (SUHI) intensity increased (by 0.20–0.41 K) during a period of reduced human activity. Our study provides strong observational evidence of the influence of agricultural activity on rural climate in this region and its indirect impact on the SUHI intensity.","Chakraborty, T.

We also conducted detailed interviews with select fellows and described their specific projects in a brief case series. RESULTS: Forty-one of the 99 CI fellows responded to our survey. Seventy-five percent agreed that they were ""able to apply clinical informatics training and interest to the COVID-19 response."" The most common project types were telemedicine (63%), reporting and analytics (49%), and electronic health record builds and governance (32%). Telehealth projects included training providers on existing telehealth tools, building entirely new virtual clinics for video triage of COVID-19 patients, and pioneering workflows and implementation of brand-new emergency department and inpatient video visit types. Analytics projects included reports and dashboards for institutional leadership, as well as developing digital contact tracing tools. For electronic health record builds, fellows directly contributed to note templates with embedded screening and testing guidance, adding COVID-19 tests to order sets, and validating clinical triage workflows.

One variant may escape immunity elicited by another, and the delta VOC has been reported to escape beta elicited immunity (1). Systematic mapping of the serological distance of current and emerging variants will likely guide the design of vaccines which can target all variants. Here we isolated and serologically characterized SARS-CoV-2 which evolved from an ancestral strain in a person with advanced HIV disease and delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance. This virus showed evolving escape from self antibody neutralization immunity and decreased Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine neutralization sensitivity. We mapped neutralization of evolved virus and ancestral, beta and delta variant viruses by antibodies elicited by each VOC in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals. Beta virus showed moderate (7-fold) and delta slight escape from neutralizing immunity elicited by ancestral virus infection. In contrast, delta virus had stronger escape from beta elicited immunity (12-fold), and beta virus even stronger escape from delta immunity (34-fold). Evolved virus had 9-fold escape from ancestral immunity, 27-fold escape from delta immunity, but was effectively neutralized by beta immunity. We conclude that beta and delta are serologically distant, further than each is from ancestral, and that virus evolved in prolonged infection during advanced HIV disease is serologically close to beta and far from delta. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is diverging into distinct serological phenotypes and that vaccines tailored to one variant may become vulnerable to infections with another.","Cele, Sandile; Karim, Farina; Lustig, Gila; James, San Emmanuel; Hermanus, Tandile; Wilkinson, Eduan; Snyman, Jumari; Bernstein, Mallory; Khan, Khadija; Hwa, Shi-Hsia; Tegally, Houriiyah; Tilles, Sasha W; Giandhari, Jennifer; Mthabela, Ntombifuthi; Mazibuko, Matilda; Ganga, Yashica; Gosnell, Bernadett I; Karim, Salim Abdool; Hanekom, Willem; Voorhis, Wesley C Van; Ndungu, Thumbi; Lessells, Richard J; Moore, Penny L; Moosa, Mahomed-Yunus S; Oliveira, Tulio de; Sigal, Alex",,565,24

However, data are limited in these patients. We aimed to report the incidence, risk factors, and prognostic impact of severe AKI in critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute respiratory failure. METHODS: A retrospective monocenter study including adult patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The primary outcome was to identify the incidence and risk factors associated with severe AKI (KDIGO stages 2 or 3). RESULTS: Overall, 110 COVID-19 patients were admitted. Among them, 77 (70%) required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), 66 (60%) received vasopressor support, and 9 (8.2%) needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Severe AKI occurred in 50 patients (45.4%). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, severe AKI was independently associated with age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.08 (95% CI (confidence interval): 1.03-1.14), p = 0.003), IMV (OR = 33.44 (95% CI: 2.20-507.77), p = 0.011), creatinine level on admission (OR = 1.04 (95% CI: 1.008-1.065), p = 0.012), and ECMO (OR = 11.42 (95% CI: 1.95-66.70), p = 0.007). Inflammatory (interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and ferritin) or thrombotic (D-dimer and fibrinogen) markers were not associated with severe AKI after adjustment for potential confounders. Severe AKI was independently associated with hospital mortality (OR = 29.73 (95% CI: 4.10-215.77), p = 0.001) and longer hospital length of stay (subhazard ratio = 0.26 (95% CI: 0.14-0.51), p < 0.001). At the time of hospital discharge, 74.1% of patients with severe AKI who were discharged alive from the hospital recovered normal or baseline renal function. CONCLUSION: Severe AKI was common in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and was not associated with inflammatory or thrombotic markers. Severe AKI was an independent risk factor of hospital mortality and hospital length of stay, and it should be rapidly recognized during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ghosn, Muriel; Attallah, Nizar; Badr, Mohamed; Abdallah, Khaled; De Oliveira, Bruno; Nadeem, Ashraf; Varghese, Yeldho; Munde, Dnyaseshwar; Salam, Shameen; Abduljawad, Baraa; Saleh, Khaled; Elkambergy, Hussam; Wahla, Ali; Taha, Ahmed; Dibu, Jamil; Bayrlee, Ahmed; Hamed, Fadi; Rahman, Nadeem; Mallat, Jihad",,565,15

Categories associated with indirect effects were psychological worry (i.e., about contracting SARS-COV-2, altering medications, impact on family, and impact on job and finances) and psychological stress (i.e., at work, at home, from non-routine family responsibilities, about uncertainty related to SARS-CoV-2, and from the media). Patients often reported several effects coalesced in causing more rheumatic disease symptoms. Conclusion: Coping with the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with rheumatic disease-related physical and psychological effects, even among patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2. According to patients, these effects adversely impacted their rheumatic diseases. Clinicians will need to ascertain the long-term sequelae of these effects and determine what therapeutic and psychological interventions are indicated.","Mancuso, Carol A; Duculan, Roland; Jannat-Khah, Deanna; Barbhaiya, Medha; Bass, Anne R; Mehta, Bella",HSS J,565,16

By raising pyrexia, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ failure are observed to develop which are not only associated with coronavirus. The treatment of the virus and the systemic inflammatory response it causes are also very important. The rapid response to infection has been well defined and comprises a complex interaction of cytokine storm, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and pathologic coagulation. Since the effective therapies are missing and immunological treatments may be deficient, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), by reason of their potent immunomodulatory ability, can have useful results in order to prevent the cytokine storm and reduce morbidity and mortality for COVID-19.

For patients with more severe symptoms, initial treatment with long acting ß2-agonists and long-acting muscarinic antagonists combination therapy is recommended. Tiotropium + olodaterol fixed-dose combination (Tio+Olo FDC) is an aqueous solution of tiotropium bromide and olodaterol delivered by the RESPIMAT® Soft MistTM inhaler for patients with moderate to very severe COPD. METHODS: This single site, open-label, phase Ib clinical study assessed the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profiles of once-daily Tio+Olo FDC (5 µg/5 µg) after single dose and at steady state in Chinese patients with moderate to severe COPD over 3 weeks. The PK and safety profiles of Japanese and Caucasian populations from 2 independent COPD studies were provided for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 12 Chinese patients received Tio+Olo FDC. After multiple inhaled administration of Tio+Olo FDC, tiotropium and olodaterol were rapidly absorbed and reached peak plasma concentration at about 5 and 25 min, respectively. The accumulation ratios after multiple administrations were 1.3 and 1.6 for tiotropium and olodaterol in Chinese patients. Tio+Olo FDC was well-tolerated; all AEs were mild.

The current guideline is using RT-PCR for testing. As a complimentary tool with diagnostic imaging, chest Computed Tomography (CT) has been shown to be able to reveal visual patterns characteristic for COVID-19, which has definite value at several stages during the disease course. To facilitate CT analysis, recent efforts have focused on computer-aided characterization and diagnosis with chest CT scan, which has shown promising results. However, domain shift of data across clinical data centers poses a serious challenge when deploying learning-based models. A common way to alleviate this issue is to fine-tune the model locally with the target domains local data and annotations. Unfortunately, the availability and quality of local annotations usually varies due to heterogeneity in equipment and distribution of medical resources across the globe. This impact may be pronounced in the detection of COVID-19, since the relevant patterns vary in size, shape, and texture. In this work, we attempt to find a solution for this challenge via federated and semi-supervised learning. A multi-national database consisting of 1704 scans from three countries is adopted to study the performance gap, when training a model with one dataset and applying it to another. Expert radiologists manually delineated 945 scans for COVID-19 findings. In handling the variability in both the data and annotations, a novel federated semi-supervised learning technique is proposed to fully utilize all available data (with or without annotations). Federated learning avoids the need for sensitive data-sharing, which makes it favorable for institutions and nations with strict regulatory policy on data privacy. Moreover, semi-supervision potentially reduces the annotation burden under a distributed setting. The proposed framework is shown to be effective compared to fully supervised scenarios with conventional data sharing instead of model weight sharing.","Yang, Dong; Xu, Ziyue; Li, Wenqi; Myronenko, Andriy; Roth, Holger R; Harmon, Stephanie; Xu, Sheng; Turkbey, Baris; Turkbey, Evrim; Wang, Xiaosong; Zhu, Wentao; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo; Patella, Francesca; Cariati, Maurizio; Obinata, Hirofumi; Mori, Hitoshi; Tamura, Kaku; An, Peng; Wood, Bradford J; Xu, Daguang",Med Image Anal,565,1

DESIGN: Outbreak investigation. SETTING: University-affiliated tertiary-care referral center. PATIENTS: Operating room staff with positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. METHODS: Epidemiologic and environmental investigations were conducted including contact tracing, environmental surveys, and sampling and review of the operating room schedule for staff-to-staff, staff-to-patient, and patient-to-staff SARS-CoV-2 transmission. RESULTS: In total, 24 healthcare personnel (HCP) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, including nurses (29%), surgical technologists (25%), and surgical residents (16%). Moreover, 19 HCP (79%) reported having used a communal area, most commonly break rooms (75%). Overall, 20 HCP (83%) reported symptomatic disease. In total, 72 environmental samples were collected from communal areas for SARS-CoV-2 genomic testing; none was positive. Furthermore, 236 surgical cases were reviewed for transmission: 213 (90%) had negative preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing, 21 (9%) had a positive test on or before the date of surgery, and 2 (<1%) did not have a preoperative test performed.

However, it soon became clear that machines lack robustness on more challenging test cases, a major obstacle towards deploying machines""in the wild""and towards obtaining better computational models of human visual perception. Here we ask: Are we making progress in closing the gap between human and machine vision? To answer this question, we tested human observers on a broad range of out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, adding the""missing human baseline""by recording 85,120 psychophysical trials across 90 participants. We then investigated a range of promising machine learning developments that crucially deviate from standard supervised CNNs along three axes: objective function (self-supervised, adversarially trained, CLIP language-image training), architecture (e.g. vision transformers), and dataset size (ranging from 1M to 1B). Our findings are threefold. (1.) The longstanding robustness gap between humans and CNNs is closing, with the best models now matching or exceeding human performance on most OOD datasets. (2.) There is still a substantial image-level consistency gap, meaning that humans make different errors than models. In contrast, most models systematically agree in their categorisation errors, even substantially different ones like contrastive self-supervised vs. standard supervised models. (3.)

We aim to describe the long-term outcomes of survivors of hospitalization for COVID-19 followed up first at an outpatient facility and subsequently by telephone. METHODS: Observational prospective study conducted at a tertiary general hospital. Clinical and radiological progression was assessed and data were recorded on a standardized reporting form. Patients were divided into three groups according to Pao2/Fio2 at hospitalization: Pao2/Fio2 >300, Pao2/Fio2 300-200 and Pao2/Fio2 <200. A logistic multivariate regression model was performed to identify factors associated with persistence of symptoms. RESULTS: For facility follow up, 302 individuals were enrolled. Median follow up was 45 days after discharge; 78% (228/294) of patients had COVID-19-related symptoms (53% asthenia, 56% respiratory symptoms) and 40% (122/302) had residual pulmonary radiographic lesions. Pao2/Fio2 <200 was an independent predictor of persistent dyspnoea (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.38-2.52, p < 0.0001). Pao2/Fio2 >300 was associated with resolution of chest radiographic lesions (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42-0.74, p < 0.0001). Fifty per cent of patients required specific medical follow up after the first consultation and were transferred to another physician. A total of 294 patients were contacted for telephone follow up after a median follow-up time of 7 months. Fifty per cent of patients (147/294) still presented symptoms and 49% (145/294) had psychological disorders. Asthenia was identified in 27% (78/294) and dyspnoea in 10% (28/294) of patients independently of Pao2/Fio2. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 require long-term follow up because of the persistence of symptoms; patients with low Pao2/Fio2 during the acute illness require special attention.","Meije, Yolanda; Duarte-Borges, Alejandra; Sanz, Xavier; Clemente, Mercedes; Ribera, Alba; Ortega, Lucía; González-Pérez, Ruth; Cid, Roser; Pareja, Júlia; Cantero, Irene; Ariño, Miquel; Sagués, Teresa; LLaberia, Jaume; Ayestarán, Ana; Fernández-Hidalgo, Nuria; Candás-Estébanez, Beatriz",Clin. microbiol. infect,565,20

We examined the association between COVID-19 at delivery and adverse pregnancy outcomes, maternal complications, and severe illness, whether these associations differ by race/ethnicity; and described discharge status by COVID-19 diagnosis and maternal complications. METHODS: Data from 703 hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database during March-September 2020 were included. Adjusted risk ratios overall and stratified by race/ethnicity were estimated using Poisson regression with robust standard errors. Proportion not discharged home was calculated by maternal complications, stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 489,471 delivery hospitalizations, 6,550 (1.3%) had a COVID-19 diagnosis. In adjusted models, COVID-19 was associated with increased risk for: acute respiratory distress syndrome (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 34.4), death (aRR = 17.0), sepsis (aRR = 13.6), mechanical ventilation (aRR = 12.7), shock (aRR = 5.1), intensive care unit admission (aRR = 3.6), acute renal failure (aRR = 3.5), thromboembolic disease (aRR = 2.7), adverse cardiac event/outcome (aRR = 2.2) and preterm labor with preterm delivery (aRR = 1.2). Risk for any maternal complications or for any severe illness did not significantly differ by race/ethnicity. Discharge status did not differ by COVID-19; however, among women with concurrent maternal complications, a greater proportion of those with (versus without) COVID-19 were not discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize the importance of implementing recommended mitigation strategies to reduce risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and further inform counseling and clinical care for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ko, Jean Y; DeSisto, Carla L; Simeone, Regina M; Ellington, Sascha; Galang, Romeo R; Oduyebo, Titilope; Gilboa, Suzanne M; Lavery, Amy M; Gundlapalli, Adi V; Shapiro-Mendoza, Carrie K",Clin. infect. dis,565,20

The application of strict lockdown measures disproportionately affected both cancer patient care as well as basic and translational cancer research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Italian Cancer Society (SIC) conducted a survey on the effect of lockdown on laboratories involved in cancer research in Italy. The survey was completed by 570 researchers at different stages of their career, working in cancer centers, research institutes and universities from 19 Italian regions. RESULTS: During the lockdown period, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic emergency on face-to-face research activities was high, with a complete (47.7%) or partial (36.1%) shutdown of the laboratories. In the post-lockdown period, research activities were resumed in most of the respondents' institutions (80.4%), though with some restrictions (77.2%). COVID-19 testing was offered to research personnel only in ~50% of research institutions. Overall, the response to the pandemic was fragmented as in many cases institutions adopted different strategies often aimed at limiting possible infections without a clearly defined contingency plan. Nevertheless, research was able to provide the first answers and possible ways out of the pandemic, also with the contribution of many cancer researchers that sacrificed their research programs to help overcome the pandemic by offering their knowledge and technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Given the current persistence of an emergency situation in many European countries, a more adequate organization of research centers will be urgent and necessary to ensure the continuity of laboratory activities in a safe environment.","Bianchi, F; Dama, E; Di Nicolantonio, F; Baldassarre, G; Guerriero, I; Torchiaro, E; Bruno, A; Blandino, G; Allavena, P; Chiarugi, P; Sozzi, G; D039,; Incalci, M; Normanno, N",ESMO Open,565,15

A subset of patients, in addition to presenting with typical features such as fever, cough and dyspnea, was also afflicted with diarrhea. However, the clinical features and prognoses related to COVID-19-associated diarrhea have not attracted sufficient attention. This review of the medical literature examines the incidence, pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, fecal virus changes, prognoses and influencing factors of COVID-19-associated diarrhea. The reported incidence of diarrhea in patients with COVID-19 ranged from 2% to 49.5%. The main cause of diarrhea was found to be invasive by SARS-CoV-2 of ACE-2-expressing epithelial cells of the small intestine, causing local intestinal damage. This cellular invasion may be the key factor for the much longer duration of SARS-CoV-2 positivity observed for feces compared to pharyngeal swabs. The associated diarrhea in these patients upsets the balance of intestinal flora, resulting in more-severe disease intensity and worse prognosis. Clinicians should be vigilant to this kind of COVID-19-associated diarrhea, and design more effective prevention and treatment options for patients with positive fecal nucleic acid tests and intestinal microflora disorders.","Wang, Fantao; Zheng, Shiliang; Zheng, Chengbin; Sun, Xiaodong",Life Sci,565,6

The Northern Emirates of the United Arab Emirates (NEUAE) had imposed intense preventive lockdown measures. On the first of April 2020, a lockdown was implemented. It was assumed, due to lower emissions, that the air quality and Surface Urban Heat Island Intensity (SUHII) had been strengthened significantly. In this research, three parameters for Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), and SUHII variables were examined through the NEUAE. we evaluated the percentage of the change in these parameters as revealed by satellite data for 2 cycles in 2019 (March 1st to June 30th) and 2020 (March 1st to June 30th). The core results showed that during lockdown periods, the average of NO2, AOD, and SUHII levels declined by 23.7%, 3.7%, and 19.2%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2019. Validation for results demonstrates a high agreement between the predicted and measured values. The agreement was as high as R2=0.7, R2=0.6, and R2=0.68 for NO2, AOD, and night LST, respectively, indicating significant positive linear correlations. The current study concludes that due to declining automobile and industrial emissions in the NEUAE, the lockdown initiatives substantially lowered NO2, AOD, and SUHII. In addition, the aerosols did not alter significantly since they are often linked to the natural occurrence of dust storms throughout this time of the year. The pandemic is likely to influence several policy decisions to introduce strategies to control air pollution and SUHII. Lockdown experiences may theoretically play a key role in the future as a possible solution for air pollution and SUHII abatement.","Alqasemi, Abduldaem S; Hereher, Mohamed E; Kaplan, Gordana; Al-Quraishi, Ayad M Fadhil; Saibi, Hakim",Sci Total Environ,565,20

Indeed, a prevalence of 32% for all subjects &gt;50 years has been reported. However, as ARDS is a syndrome, etiologies were various and by definition non-homogenous. Nonetheless, it is unknown if this proportion will be the same in a more homogenous cohort of patients as encountered in this pandemic due to SARS Cov-2. Therefore, neurocognitive evaluation was performed in surviving ARDS patients to evaluate the presence of eventual deficit. Materials and Methods: All ARDS patients admitted to our ICU, after given their inform consent, were included in the study. To assess their neurocognitive status, MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) score and the SDMT (Symbol Digit Modalities Test) test were used as screening tools and performed by a trained neuropsychologist. When a neuropsychological deficit was clinically suspected, complete neuropsychological tests were performed instead. The tests were carried out three month after ICU admission, and if pathological, repeated at six. If still positive, full tests were suggested and followed by appropriate treatment if accepted. Results: There were 12 patients (8 males) with a mean age of 60 y.o (range 52-73). Ten were screened and 2 carried out complete tests. Among the ten, screening tests revealed a deficit in 4 (40% of patients, 4 MoCA score &lt;26/30 and 2 SDMT &lt;34). Two patients accepted complete tests (also pathological) and treatment was started in one after acceptance. In the 2 patients with immediate full tests, 1 had abnormal results and treatment was started. Conclusion: Neurocognitive deficit seems to be frequent in ARDS patients at 3 and 6 months after COVID-19 disease (42% of patients). These results are similar to those reported in the literature with a prevalence of 32% for all subjects&gt; 50 years admitted to intensive care regardless of the initial pathology. Therefore, the initial hypothesis that a reversible homogenous viral cause of ARDS could decrease the proportion of neurocognitive deficit is not confirmed. Thus, cognitive alteration could be more related to sedation than to the initial illness. Further studies are required to valid this hypothesis.","Henrie, J.; Pasau, T.; Mormont, E.; Lassaux, A.; Dive, A.; Michaux, I.; Evrard, P.; Horlait, G.; Bulpa, P.

Several studies have been performed, focusing on understanding the acute respiratory syndrome and treatment strategies. However, there is growing evidence indicating neurological manifestations occur in patients with COVID-19. Similarly, the other coronaviruses (CoV) epidemics; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) have been associated with neurological complications. METHODS: This systematic review serves to summarize available information regarding the potential effects of different types of CoV on the nervous system and describes the range of clinical neurological complications that have been reported thus far in COVID-19. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-five studies on CoV infections associated neurological manifestations in human were reviewed. Of those, 208 articles were pertinent to COVID-19. The most common neurological complaints in COVID-19 were anosmia, ageusia, and headache, but more serious complications, such as stroke, impairment of consciousness, seizures, and encephalopathy, have also been reported. CONCLUSION: There are several similarities between neurological complications after SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and COVID-19, however, the scope of the epidemics and number of patients are very different. Reports on the neurological complications after and during COVID-19 are growing on a daily basis. Accordingly, comprehensive knowledge of these complications will help health care providers to be attentive to these complications and diagnose and treat them timely.","Sharifian-Dorche, Maryam; Huot, Philippe; Osherov, Michael; Wen, Dingke; Saveriano, Alexander; Giacomini, Paul S; Antel, Jack P; Mowla, Ashkan",J Neurol Sci,565,16

We used an ELISA method that measure IgG against anti-Spike 1 and a chemiluminescence immunoassays that measure IgG anti-RBD. In the patients, antibodies concentrations tend to decline after a few months with both methods, but persist relatively high up to nearly a year after symptoms. In vaccinated subjects, antibodies were already detectable after the first dose, but after the booster they show a significant increase. However, the decrease is rapid, given that after 3 months after the second vaccination they are reduced to less than a quarter. The conversion of the results into BAU units improves the relationship between the two methods. However, in vaccinated subjects there was no evidence of proportional error after the conversion, while in the patients the difference between the two methods remained significant.","Dittadi, Ruggero; Seguso, Mara; Isabella, Bertoli; Afshar, Haleh; Carraro, Paolo",,565,12

Topical therapy is the gold standard for psoriasis patients with mild disease courses and for complementary and maintenance treatment in moderate and severe forms. However, while new systemic therapies are rapidly implemented in the daily routine as our pathomechanistic understanding of psoriasis evolves, the development of topical psoriasis therapies stagnates. Modern topical treatments though would require not only new active substances but also improved galenics. Due to their unique ability to directly exert biologic functions, but also to deliver drugs in optimal concentrations, enabling increased therapeutic efficacy, reduced adverse effects and improved patient compliance, nanoparticles may represent ideal drug carriers for local therapeutics in psoriasis. In recent years, a series of reports added important insights into the biology of skin-nanoparticles interactions and on how they impact the epidermal and dermal inflammatory compartments in vitro and in psoriasis plaques. Furthermore, by targeting anti-inflammatory substances to specific skin compartments, nanotechnological advances offer the exciting opportunity to fine tune skin inflammation at molecular and cellular levels, paving the road to a high-precision, skin-directed topical therapy in psoriasis. However, nanoparticles-based therapies have not yet found their way into clinical routine in dermatology. We here resume the current advances in the research of nanoparticles and skin inflammation in general and psoriasis in particular and discuss how this promising technology should develop in order to fulfill the requirements of an optimal skin therapy.","Sindrilaru, Anca; Filip, Adriana; Scharffetter-Kochanek, Karin; Crisan, Diana",Exp. dermatol,565,16

The awareness of COVID­19 clinical manifestations can improve the early detection of mild cases, possibly reducing further transmission to colleagues and patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was carried out in March-May 2020, involving medical school physicians in a teaching hospital in northern Italy, with a working population of 881 medical doctors. Data collection was performed using a structured form investigating clinical and epidemiological information. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-two medical doctors contacted the Occupational Health Service reporting acute respiratory symptoms or close contact exposure to a confirmed COVID­19 case. Among the confirmed COVID­19 cases, most were male doctors during residency, and 85% presented a mild clinical picture. Fever (70.3%) and cough (51.4%) represented the most prevalent symptoms of COVID­19. As revealed by the univariate analysis, the prevalence of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positivity increased with age (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02-1.14, p = 0.012), working in a COVID­19 ward (OR = 3.33, 95% CI: 1.09-10.21, p = 0.031), presenting alteration or loss of smell/taste (OR = 10.00, 95%CI: 2.80-35.69, p < 0.001) and myalgia (OR = 3.20, 95% CI: 1.00-10.26, p = 0.046), while being a resident (OR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.05-0.80, p = 0.030) was associated with reduced odds of being infected, compared to staff physicians. Age and loss of smell/taste were the only factors independently associated with RT-PCR positivity. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of COVID­19 cases showed a mild clinical syndrome, ranging from absence or paucity of symptoms to common cold or influenza-like symptoms.

Technical success generally remains high although ""failure-to-cross"" still complicates 5-20% of cases. Extended efforts to cross long, occlusive lesions can utilize significant hospital and practitioner resources. The hospital is typically reimbursed for this effort as facility fees are charged by the hour and materials are charged per use. However, given the lack of a CPT® code for ""failure-to-cross,"" practitioners are rarely appropriately compensated. The purpose of this study is to analyze the predictors, technical details, outcomes, and costs of ""failure-to-cross"" during PPI. METHODS: All PPI procedures over a 2-year period at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical characteristics, results, costs, and reimbursements obtained from hospital cost accounting were compared among successful therapeutic interventions, crossing failures, and diagnostic angiograms without attempted intervention. RESULTS: A total of 146 consecutive PPIs were identified; the rate of ""failure-to-cross"" was 11.6% (17 patients). The majority of patients with ""failure-to-cross"" were male (82%) with single-vessel runoff (53%). Compared to successful interventions, the incidences of chronic limb-threatening ischemia (82% vs. 70%, P = 0.34) and infrapopliteal occlusive disease were similar (47% vs. 31%, P = 0.20). ""Failure-to-cross"" procedures were just as long as successful procedures; there were no significant differences in fluoroscopy time (27 ± 10 vs. 24 ± 14 min, P = 0.52), in-room time (106 ± 98 vs. 103 ± 44 min, P = 0.84), or contrast dye volume utilization (73 ± 37 vs. 96 ± 54 mL, P = 0.12). As expected, ""failure-to-cross"" procedures incurred far higher hospital charges and costs compared to noninterventional diagnostic angiograms (charges $13,311 ± 6,067 vs. $7,690 ± 1,942, P < 0.01; costs $5,289 ± 2,099 vs. $2,826 ± 1,198, P < 0.01). Despite the additional time and effort spent attempting to cross difficult lesions, the operators were reimbursed at the same low rate as a purely diagnostic procedure (average fee charge $7,360; average reimbursement $992). After 1 year, the 17 patients in whom lesions could not be crossed were treated with advanced interventional procedures with success (n = 2), surgical bypass grafting (n = 5), extremity amputation (n = 4), or no additional intervention in their salvaged limb (n = 6). CONCLUSIONS: Patients whose lesions cannot be crossed during PPI fare worse than patients undergoing successful interventions. Hospital costs and charges appropriately reflect the high technical difficulty and resource utilization of extended attempts at endovascular therapy. For practitioners, crossing lesions during PPI is truly a ""pay-for-performance"" procedure in that only successful procedures are reasonably reimbursed.","El Khoury, Rym; Cataneo, Jose L; Paredes, Juan A; Schwartz, Alexander M; Jacobs, Chad E; White, John V; Schwartz, Lewis B",Ann. vasc. surg,565,9

Concerns are rising regarding the quality of such products, as the safeguard of consumers is a priority worldwide. We analyse here the ethanolic content of seven off-the-shelf hand sanitiser gels (two biocides and five cosmetics) from the Italian market, using gas chromatography. The WHO recommends that products containing ethanol should have 60-95% (v/v) alcohol. Four of the tested hand gels have ethanolic contents within the recommended range, while three products (all cosmetics) contain < 60% (v/v), i.e. 52.1% (w/w), ethanol. The product with the lowest alcoholic content has 37.1% w/w ethanol. Toxic methanol is not found in any of the hand sanitisers. We show, in addition, that products with the highest ethanolic content have generally greater antibacterial activity. In conclusion, all tested products are complying with the EU regulations, as the three ""substandard"" products are classified as cosmetics, whose purpose is cleaning and not disinfecting. Nevertheless, if such hand cleaners were inappropriately used as hand disinfectants, they might be ineffective. Thus, consumer safety relays on awareness and ability to distinguish between biocidal and cosmetics hand gels. The obtained results might sensitise the scientific community, health agencies and ultimately consumers towards the risks of using hand sanitisers of substandard alcoholic concentration.

Pregnant women are an important subgroup to study the health consequences due to physical inactivity since it can lead to adverse outcomes in pregnancy and even after delivery. Therefore, we aimed at understanding the level of physical activity among pregnant women, prevalence of prenatal and postnatal depressive symptoms and whether level of physical activity is associated with prenatal and postnatal depressive symptoms. METHODS: In an ongoing cohort study, we measured the physical activity using a validated Physical Activity Level (PAL) questionnaire. We administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during pregnancy and within seven days of delivery to assess depressive symptoms in 1406 women. Associations were adjusted for potential confounders such as maternal age, education, socioeconomic status, gravida, EPDS score during pregnancy, social support, skinfold thickness, blood pressure, blood sugar level. RESULTS: We found that 7.2% of pregnant women had low levels of physical activity. The prevalence of prenatal and postnatal depressive symptoms was 9.0% and 31.9% respectively. Pregnant women with a low level of physical activity had significantly higher odds of developing postpartum depressive symptoms (ORâ¯=â¯3.15, CI: 1.98-5.02, pâ¯<â¯0.001) when adjusted for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate level of physical activity among pregnant mothers is essential and has its association with postnatal depressive symptoms. Health care professionals need to counsel pregnant women to assess depressive symptoms at both the prenatal and postpartum period and inform them about the importance of the optimal level of physical activity.","Ana, Yamuna; Lewis, Melissa Glenda; van Schayck, Onno C P; Babu, Giridhara R",J Psychosom Res,565,12

MATERIAL & METHODS: Twenty adult patients with slight-moderate chronic periodontitis received periodontal probing using controlled-force electronic probe at 2 visits. In visit 1, a random arch was probed with either a ball-end (0.6mm diameter, 408 kPa; Test) or straight (0.45mm diameter, 726 kPa; Control) probe tip. The opposing arch was then probed using the other probe tip. Discomfort associated with each probing episode was recorded using visual analogue scale (VAS). 7 days later, tip assignments were alternated from visit 1 and VAS re-scored. VAS scores were compared by probe tip, arches and visits. RESULTS: Both tips provided similar VAS scores (median 13.5 for ball-end and 14 for straight, p=0.3713). However, the straight tip was associated with decreased VAS scores in the maxilla (p=0.01). Overall, VAS values did not differ by arch or study visit. Individual VAS scores showed high levels of correlation between study visits and between tips used (R2 =0.86 and 0.64, respectively, P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Both probing approaches were associated with low levels of pain on probing.

A simultaneous, multi-pronged approach using conventional drug discovery methods aimed at discovering novel chemical and biological means of targeting a short list of host and viral entities which should extend the arsenal of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. This longer term strategy would provide a deeper pool of drug choices for future-proofing against acquired drug resistance.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further heightened the inequity faced by female physicians as they are challenged by increasing household and childcare duties in addition to their professional responsibilities. Given these hurdles, fewer women than men have published in various medical disciplines. In this brief report, we wanted to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the academic output of female physicians and researchers in transfusion medicine. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared all articles in four transfusion medicine journals published from January 1 to July 31, 2019 with the same time period in 2020. Overall, 1024 articles were reviewed for whether they included women as first or senior authors. RESULTS: Overall, women were first authors in 45.9% (n = 458) of all publications and senior authors in 35% (n = 356) of all publications. There was a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of women as first authors between 2019 (49.1%) and 2020 (42.7%) (p = .04). There was no significant change in the percentage of women as senior authors between 2019 (35.4%) and 2020 (35.5%) (p = 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Similar to other medical specialties, the COVID-19 pandemic has further increased the disparities faced by female researchers in transfusion medicine as evidenced by a decrease in publications with women as first authors.","Ipe, Tina S; Goel, Ruchika; Howes, Lydia; Bakhtary, Sara",Transfusion,565,16

Regardless of which mask is used, performing hand hygiene frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or with soap and water if hands are dirty is the most effective preventive measure for COVID-19. The type of mask used when caring for COVID-19 patients will vary according to the setting, type of personnel/person, and activity. Although the main transmission route for COVID-19 is droplets, during aerosol generating procedures airborne transmission may occur.

AIM: We evaluated the frequency and intensity of favipiravir-associated fluorescence. PATIENTS/METHODS: The participants comprised patients who had taken at least a single dose of favipiravir and been examined no later than 30 days after the last dose. The gender, age, body mass index (BMI), Fitzpatrick's skin-type, hair color, N-acetylcysteine use, presence and the intensity of fluorescent reflection under Wood's light in the lunulae of the fingernails, hair, and the face were recorded. RESULTS: There were 275 patients, 144 (52.4%) of whom were women. 165 (57.9%) had used treatment for a maximum of 5 days, 99 (34.7%) for 6-10 days, and 21 (7.4%) for more than ten days. Using more than 22 tablets of favipiravir increased the probability of detecting fluorescence in the lunulae by 6.72 (2.61-17.23) times. Using more than 28 tablets increased the risk of fluorescence in hair and the T-zone by 5.92 (2.43-14.71) and 2.88 (1.11-7.47) times, respectively.

In the absence of curative drugs and with vaccines development still in progress, alternative approaches to stem the tide of the pandemic are being considered. The potential of a phytotherapeutic approach in the management of the dreaded disease has gained attention, especially in developing countries, with several claims of the development of anti-COVID-19 herbal formulations. This is a plausible approach especially with the increasing acceptance of herbal medicine in both alternative and orthodox medical practices worldwide. Also, the established efficacy of herbal remedies in the treatment of numerous viral diseases including those caused by coronaviruses, as well as diseases with symptoms associated with COVID-19, presents a valid case for serious consideration of herbal medicine in the treatment of COVID-19. However, there are legitimate concerns and daunting challenges with the use of herbs and herbal products. These include issues of quality control, unethical production practice, inadequate information on the composition, use and mechanisms, weak regulatory policies, herb-drug interactions and adverse reactions, and the tendency for abuse.

However, due to its limitations, serological testing is considered an alternative method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 exposure. In this study, we measured the level of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies of male professional football players and compared the results with the standard PCR test to investigate the association between the two tests. STUDY DESIGN: Participants were male professional football players and team officials. Nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood samples were collected for the PCR and serological tests, respectively. Also, previous records of COVID-19 testing and symptoms were gathered. Those with previous positive PCR tests who tested negative for the second time were considered to be recovered patients. RESULTS: Of the 1243 subjects, 222 (17.9%) were seropositive, while 29 (2.3%) tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Sixty percent of symptomatic cases with a negative PCR were found to be seropositive. The mean level of IgM was significantly higher in PCR-positive and symptomatic subjects, whereas the recovered cases showed significantly higher levels of IgG.

METHODS: Multicentre study, with 19 participating centers, to define the impact of the pandemic on the provision of aortovascular services and patients' outcomes after having adapted the thresholds for intervention to guarantee access to treatment for emergency and urgent conditions. Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, including all patients with aortovascular conditions admitted for surgical or conservative treatment from the 1st March to the 20th May 2020. RESULTS: A total of 189 patients were analyzed, and 182 underwent surgery. Diagnosis included: aneurysm (45%), acute aortic syndrome (44%), pseudoaneurysm (4%), aortic valve endocarditis (4%), and other (3%). Timing for surgery was: emergency (40%), urgent (34%), or elective (26%). In-hospital mortality was 12%. Thirteen patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the peri-operative period, and this subgroup was not associated with a higher mortality. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant change in service provision for aortovascular patients in the UK. Although the emergency and urgent surgical activity were maintained, elective treatment was minimal during early months of the pandemic. The preoperative COVID-19 screening protocol, combined with self-isolation and shielding, contributed to the low incidence of COVID-19 in our series and a mortality similar to that of pre-pandemic outcomes.","Lopez-Marco, Ana; Harky, Amer; Verdichizzo, Danilo; Hope, Emma; Rosser, Barbara; McPherson, Iain; Kelly, Ronan; Holland, Luke; Ye Oo, Aung",J Card Surg,565,16

The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence and risk factors for lung involvement in 247 patients with a visual score and assess the prevalence of incidental findings. METHODS: For 12 days in March 2020, 250 patients with RT-PCR positive tests and who underwent LDCT were prospectively included. Clinical and imaging findings were recorded. The extent of lung involvement was quantified using a score ranging from 0 to 40. A logistic regression model was used to explore factors associated with a score &#8805; 10. RESULTS: A total of 247 patients were analyzed; 138 (54%) showed lung involvement. The mean score was 4.5 ± 6.5, and the mean score for patients with lung involvement was 8.1 ± 6.8 [1-31]. The mean age was 43 ± 15 years, with 121 males (48%) and 17 asymptomatic patients (7%). Multivariate analysis showed that age > 54 years (odds ratio 4.4[2.0-9.6] p < 0.001) and diabetes (4.7[1.0-22.1] p = 0.049) were risk factors for a score &#8805; 10. Multivariate analysis including symptoms showed that only age > 54 years (4.1[1.7-10.0] p = 0.002) was a risk factor for a score &#8805; 10. Rhinitis (0.3[0.1-0.7] p = 0.005) and anosmia (0.3[0.1-0.9] p = 0.043) were protective against lung involvement. Incidental imaging findings were found in 19% of patients, with a need for follow-up in 0.6%. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of lung involvement was 54% in a predominantly paucisymptomatic population. Age &#8805; 55 years and diabetes were risk factors for significant parenchymal lung involvement.

Therefore, this study inspects the mental health status, behavioral response, and perception among HCWs (nurses, physicians, and medical laboratory workers) during the COVID-19 pandemic in public health care facilities. Methods: A facilities-based cross-sectional study was conducted in July 2020. A simple random sampling technique was used to select study participants. Data were collected by self-report administered questionnaires using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression, General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) for insomnia, Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) for psychological distress, Perceived Threat Scale for perception, and Behavioral Response Inquiry for the behavioral response. Moreover, bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions analysis was used to identify the association between dependent and independent variables at p-value &lt;0.05. Results: A total of 417 (98.6%) HCWs responded to a self-administered questionnaire. The proportion of HCWs who had moderate to severe symptoms of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic were 58, 16.3, 30.7, and 15.9%, respectively. Three-fifth of the nurses, medical laboratory professionals (62.2%), and physicians (59.2%) had reported good behavioral responses toward the COVID-19 pandemic. More than three-fifths of the nurses had reported poor perception toward the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversely, 61.2% of physicians and three-fourths (75.5%) of medical laboratory professionals had reported good perception toward the COVID-19 pandemic. Female and married participants, those working in the emergency unit, those with poor behavioral responses, and those with poor perception toward the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly associated with symptoms of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Conclusions: Psychological impacts among physicians, nurses, and medical laboratory professionals are high during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health should aim to protect all HCWs' psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic with appropriate interventions and accurate information response.","Jemal, K.; Deriba, B.

AIMS: We aim to assess the psychological impact of Covid-19 on frontline health care workers (HCWs), including anxiety, depression and stress of threat of the disease. METHOD: The study was a cross-sectional survey among the frontline HCWs in a hospital at Jinan, China. Data were collected through an anonymous, self-rated questionnaire, including basic demographic data, a 10-item Covid-19 stress questionnaire, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). The risk and rate of anxiety, depression and stress of Covid-19 were estimated. RESULTS: Among the 309 participants, there were 88 (28.5%) with anxiety and 172 (56.0%) with depression. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that age â©½ 30 years, age > 30 to 45 years, working in confirmed case isolation wards, and worrying about disinfection measures being not sufficient were independently associated with anxiety with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval, CI) of 4.4 (1.6-12.2), 3.1 (1.1-8.8), 2.3 (1.4-4.0) and 2.5 (1.5-4.3), respectively; age â©½ 30 years, age > 30 to 45 years, nurse and worrying about disinfection measure being not sufficient were independently associated with depression with an odds ratio (95% CI) of 3.8 (1.8-7.8), 2.7 (1.3-5.7), 2.5 (1.1-5.6) and 2.1 (1.3-3.5), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of anxiety and depression was found among frontline HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak. More psychological care should be given to young staffs and nurses.

Descriptive and ANOVA analyses indicate that people have many misconceptions about palliative care and how it should be provided. Gender, education, training, occupation, and experience as caregivers were related to the total level of knowledge about palliative care. Regression analyses show other variables as predictors of knowledge. This study highlights the lack of knowledge about specific issues within palliative care in the general population in Ecuador.

I suggest two areas of journalism research that are worth pondering during this period: our objects (what we study) and our objectives (why we study). By honestly acknowledging our shortcomings—for example, in giving overweight attention to certain objects of analysis at the expense of others, or in failing to develop a stronger public voice as part of our scholarly objectives—we can reorient our research agendas to be simultaneously responsive and reflective as we address the current crisis and prepare for the uncertainties ahead.

Currently, data on changes in sexual behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak are limited. AIM: The present study aimed to obtain a preliminary understanding of the changes in people's sexual behavior, as a result of the pandemic, and explore the context in which they manifest. METHODS: A convenience sample of 270 men and 189 women who completed an online survey consisting of 12 items plus an additional question were included in the study. OUTCOMES: The study outcomes were obtained using a study-specific questionnaire to assess the changes in people's sexual behavior. RESULTS: While there was a wide range of individual responses, our results showed that 44% of participants reported a decrease in the number of sexual partners and about 37% of participants reported a decrease in sexual frequency. Multiple regression analysis showed that age, partner relationship, and sexual desire were closely related to sexual frequency. In addition, we found that most individuals with risky sexual experiences had a rapid reduction in risky sexual behavior. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The current findings contribute to identifying another potential health implication associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and report preliminary evidence of the need to provide potential interventions for the population. STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: This study is the first to perform a preliminary exploration of sexual behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak. The generalizability of the results is limited, given that only a small convenience sample was used.

Greek table olives, one of the most emblematic and valuable Greek national products, are often subjected to economically motivated fraud. In this work, a novel ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) analytical method was developed to detect the mislabeling of Greek PDO Kalamata table olives, and thereby establish their authenticity. A non-targeted screening workflow was applied, coupled to advanced chemometric techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) in order to fingerprint and accurately discriminate PDO Greek Kalamata olives from Kalamata (or Kalamon) type olives from Egypt and Chile. The method performance was evaluated using a target set of phenolic compounds and several validation parameters were calculated. Overall, 65 table olive samples from Greece, Egypt, and Chile were analyzed and processed for the model development and its accuracy was validated. The robustness of the chemometric model was tested using 11 Greek Kalamon olive samples that were produced during the following crop year, 2018, and they were successfully classified as Greek Kalamon olives from Kalamata. Twenty-six characteristic authenticity markers were indicated to be responsible for the discrimination of Kalamon olives of different geographical origins.","Kalogiouri, Natasa P; Aalizadeh, Reza; Dasenaki, Marilena E; Thomaidis, Nikolaos S",Molecules (Basel),565,16

METHODS: A total of 2,779 cancer patients took part in an observational and lateral study carried out between April 16, 2020 and April 25, 2020. An online questionnaire was distributed including distress-related variables, demographic variables, clinical variables about their oncological condition, socioeconomic variables and variables related to information management and social communication. Distress was measured according to the Kessler (K-6) scale, and its relationship with the remaining variables was analyzed by logistic regression. RESULTS: 33.5% of the patients yielded levels of clinical distress during lockdown. Younger patients and women yielded significantly higher levels of distress. High distress levels were generally associated with the following factors: trust in medical institutions; deterioration of the household's financial conditions; and media management of the information about the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown triggered by COVID-19 increased distress among cancer patients, and this can be significantly related to a number of variables. Identifying distress, and said factors, at an early stage can help to develop mitigation strategies. Similarly, early detection can help to improve the way information is shared with patients, offer them support and resources and direct them to psychosocial services, increasing the patient's ability to return to normal after COVID-19.","Yélamos Agua, Carmen; Berzal Pérez, Elisabeth; de Haro Gázquez, Diego; Fernández Sánchez, Belén; Navarro Jiménez, José Miguel",J Psychosoc Oncol,565,12

METHODS: A survey was created evaluating (1) overall attitudes toward e-learning, (2) multi-institutional e-learning/e-conferences, (3) national/regional e-conferences, and (4) future directions with e-learning. The survey was distributed to all the orthopaedic surgery residency program directors in the United States, and they were asked to circulate the survey to their program's faculty and trainees. RESULTS: A total of 268 responses were collected, including 100 attendings and 168 trainees. Overall satisfaction with e-learning compared with in-person learning was higher among trainees than attending faculty, with 51.4% of trainees favoring e-learning, as opposed to 32.2% of attendings (P = 0.006). Both groups felt they were more likely to pay attention with in-person learning (P = 0.89). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 85.7% of residents have used e-learning platforms to join a conference in their specialty of interest while off-service. Most attendings and trainees felt e-learning should play a supplemental role in standard residency/fellowship education, with a low number of respondents feeling that it should not be used (86.6% versus 84%, and 2.1% versus 0.6%, respectively, P = 0.28). CONCLUSION: E-learning has been an important modality to continue academic pursuits during the disruption in usual education and training schedules during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most trainees and attendings surveyed felt that e-learning should play a supplementary role in resident and fellow education moving forward. Although e-learning does provide an opportunity to hold multi-institutional conferences and makes participation in meetings logistically easier, it cannot fully replicate the dynamic interactions and benefits of in-person learning.","Essilfie, Anthony A; Hurley, Eoghan T; Strauss, Eric J; Alaia, Michael J",J Am Acad Orthop Surg,565,16

To further explore their potentials as public educators and role models for the communities during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a study is conducted to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of these students toward COVID-19. MethodsAn online cross-sectional survey was conducted among undergraduate medical students in Indonesia. Socio-demographical characteristics, social interaction history, information-seeking behavior, as well as knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 were collected through a self-reported questionnaire. A p-value of <0.05 indicated statistical significance. ResultsOut of 4870 respondents, 64.9% and 51.5% had positive attitude and practice toward COVID-19 while only 29.8% had adequate knowledge. Knowledge was slightly positively correlated with attitude and practice ({rho}=0.074 and {rho}=0.054, respectively; both p<0.001), while attitude was weakly correlated with practice ({rho}=0.234, p<0.001). Several factors including age, sex, place of residence, institution type, academic level, family income, history of chronic illness, prior volunteering experience, and perceptual awareness on COVID-19 were significantly associated with either knowledge, attitude, and/or practice toward COVID-19. Furthermore, health institutions and the governments press releases, as well as health expert opinions were deemed as the most reliable sources of COVID-19-related information - yet trivially none of these sources were associated with knowledge, attitude, and practice in the study population. ConclusionMany undergraduate medical students in Indonesia had positive attitude and practice against COVID-19, yet only a few had adequate knowledge. This warrants further interventions to keep them updated with COVID-19 evidence to maximize their potentials in raising public awareness on COVID-19.","Adli, Imam; Widyahening, Indah Suci; Lazarus, Gilbert; Phowira, Jason; Azzahra, Lyanna; Ariffandi, Bagas; Putera, Aziz Muhammad; Nugraha, David; Gamalliel, Nico; Findyartini, Ardi",,565,20

In regard to patients with IBD remission: 5-aminosalycylates (5-ASAs) do not increase the risk for infection and should be continued. There is no need to suspend them or lower the dose. Immunomodulating drugs, such as thiopurines and methotrexate, should be continued, without modifying doses (even in patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection). No type of biologic therapy should be suspended, unless there are signs of COVID-19. Regarding patients with IBD activity: the oral and/or topical 5-ASA dose should be optimized in cases of disease relapse. Budesonide MMX should be considered in cases of mild-to-moderate activity, to avoid systemic steroid use. Systemic steroids should be avoided whenever possible because doses above 20mg per day have an immunosuppressive effect, which could increase susceptibility to any type of infection, including COVID-19. The combined use of thiopurines with steroids and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibodies should also be avoided because those combinations can increase the risk for infections, including COVID-19. Finally, biologic treatment with anti-TNF-alpha agents or any other mechanism of action, such as anti-integrins or anti-interleukins, should be suspended if patients become infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Those with D-dimer values greater than 2,000 were more likely to have shorter reaction times compared with those with D-dimer levels less than or equal to 2,000 (4.8 vs 5.6 min; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 have hypercoagulable thromboelastography profiles with additional derangements related to fibrinogen and platelet function. As the majority of patients have an elevated thromboelastography maximum amplitude, a follow-up study evaluating platelet aggregation would be instructive.","Yuriditsky, Eugene; Horowitz, James M; Merchan, Cristian; Ahuja, Tania; Brosnahan, Shari B; McVoy, Lauren; Berger, Jeffrey S",Crit Care Med,565,16

Recently, multiple SWI-hypointense foci were mentioned related to neurological complications of SARS-COV-2 infection. The purpose of the study was to describe the patterns of susceptibility brain changes in critically-ill patients who underwent mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). METHODS: An institutional board-approved, retrospective study was conducted on 250 ICU patients in whom brain MRI was performed between January 2011 and May 2020. Out of 48 patients who underwent mechanical ventilation/ECMO, in fifteen patients (median age 47.7 years), the presence of SWI abnormalities was observed and described. RESULTS: Microsusceptibilities were located in white-gray matter interface, in subcortical white matter (U-fibers), and surrounding subcortical nuclei in 13/14 (92,8%) patients. In 8/14 (57,1%) patients, SWI foci were seen infratentorially. The corpus callosum was affected in ten (71,4%), internal capsule in five (35,7%), and midbrain/pons in six (42,8%) patients. CONCLUSION: We showed distinct patterns of diffuse brain SWI susceptibilities in critically-ill patients who underwent mechanical ventilation/ECMO. The etiology of these foci remains uncertain, but the association with mechanical ventilation, prolonged respiratory failure, and hypoxemia seems probable explanations.","Thurnher, Majda M; Boban, Jasmina; Röggla, Martin; Staudinger, Thomas",Neuroradiology,565,20

As prehospital teams are particularly at risk of contamination given their challenging work environment, a specific gamified electronic learning (e-learning) module targeting this audience might provide significant advantages as it requires neither the presence of learners nor the repetitive use of equipment for demonstration. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a gamified e-learning module could improve the rate of adequate PPE choice by prehospital personnel in the context of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: This was an individual-level randomized, controlled, quadruple-blind (investigators, participants, outcome assessors, and data analysts) closed web-based trial. All emergency prehospital personnel working in Geneva, Switzerland, were eligible for inclusion, and were invited to participate by email in April 2020. Participants were informed that the study aim was to assess their knowledge regarding PPE, and that they would be presented with both the guidelines and the e-learning module, though they were unaware that there were two different study paths. All participants first answered a preintervention quiz designed to establish their profile and baseline knowledge. The control group then accessed the guidelines before answering a second set of questions, and were then granted access to the e-learning module. The e-learning group was shown the e-learning module right after the guidelines and before answering the second set of questions. RESULTS: Of the 291 randomized participants, 176 (60.5%) completed the trial. There was no significant difference in baseline knowledge between groups. Though the baseline proportion of adequate PPE choice was high (75%, IQR 50%-75%), participants' description of the donning sequence was in most cases incorrect. After either intervention, adequate choice of PPE increased significantly in both groups (P<.001). Though the median of the difference in the proportion of correct answers was slightly higher in the e-learning group (17%, IQR 8%-33% versus 8%, IQR 8%-33%), the difference was not statistically significant (P=.27). Confidence in the ability to use PPE was maintained in the e-learning group (P=.27) but significantly decreased in the control group (P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: Among prehospital personnel with an already relatively high knowledge of and experience with PPE use, both web-based study paths increased the rate of adequate choice of PPE. There was no major added value of the gamified e-learning module apart from preserving participants' confidence in their ability to correctly use PPE.","Suppan, Laurent; Abbas, Mohamed; Stuby, Loric; Cottet, Philippe; Larribau, Robert; Golay, Eric; Iten, Anne; Harbarth, Stephan; Gartner, Birgit; Suppan, Mélanie",J Med Internet Res,565,26

METHODS: EEG after discontinuation of sedation in all patients, and somesthesic evoked potentials and brainstem auditive evoked potentials when EEG did not show reactivity, were performed. Clinical outcome was assessed at day 7 and 14 after neurophysiological explorations. RESULTS: 33 patients were included for analysis. We found slowed background activity in 85% of cases, unreactive activity in 42% of cases, low-voltage activity in 21% of cases and rhythmic or periodic delta waves in 61% of cases. EEG epileptic events were never recorded. Clinical outcome at day 14 was associated with unreactive background activity and tended to be associated with rhythmic or periodic delta waves and with low-voltage activity. Results of multimodal evoked potentials were in favor of a preservation of central nervous system somatosensory and auditory functions. CONCLUSIONS: Among critical COVID-19 patients with abnormal arousal at discontinuation of sedation, EEG patterns consistent with encephalopathy are found and are predictive for short term clinical outcome. SIGNIFICANCE: The abnormal EEG with presence of periodic discharges and lack of reactivity could be related to encephalopathy linked to COVID-19.","Niguet, Jean-Paul; Tortuyaux, Romain; Garcia, Bruno; Jourdain, Mercè; Chaton, Laurence; Préau, Sébastien; Poissy, Julien; Favory, Raphael; Nseir, Saad; Mathieu, Daniel; Kazali Alidjinou, Enagnon; Delval, Arnaud; Derambure, Philippe",Clin Neurophysiol,565,16

The COVID-19 pandemic has made it even more important to co-create and disseminate knowledge, specifically regarding online and flexible learning formats. APPROACH: Based on the principles of social learning, we combined speed mentoring and world café formats to offer a virtual Zoom&#8482; workshop, with large and small group discussions, to reach health professions' educators across the globe. The goal was to establish a psychologically safe space for dialogue regarding adaptation to online teaching-learning formats. EVALUATION: We aimed to establish psychological safety to stimulate thought-provoking discussions within the various small groups and obtain valuable contributions from participants. From these conversations, we were able to formulate 'hot tips' on how to adapt to (sometimes new) online teaching-learning formats while nurturing teacher and student wellbeing. REFLECTION: Through this virtual workshop we realized that despite contextual differences, many challenges are common worldwide. We experienced technological difficulties during the session, which needed rapid adaptation by the organising team. We encouraged, but did not pressure, participants to use video and audio during breakout discussions as we wanted them to feel safe and comfortable.

Computed tomography (CT) plays a vital role in the diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the pulmonary CT findings and distributions of COVID-19 infection in regard to different age groups. METHODS: Chest CT scan of 104 symptomatic patients with COVID-19 infection from 7 Iraqi isolation centers were retrospectively analyzed between March 10th to April 5th, 2020. Patients were sub-classified according to their ages into three groups (young adult:20-39 years, middle age:40-59 years, and old age:60-90 years). RESULTS: The most common findings were ground-glass opacities (GGO) (92.3%, followed by consolidation (27.9%), bronchovascular thickening (15.4%), and crazy-paving (12.5%). Less commonly, there were tree-in-bud (6.7%), pulmonary nodules (5.8%), bronchiectasis (3.8%), pleural effusion (1.9%), and cavitation (1%). There were no hallo signs, reversed hallo signs, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary changes were unilateral in 16.7% and bilateral in 83.3%, central in 14.6%, peripheral in 57.3%, and diffuse (central and peripheral) in 28.1%. Most cases showed multi- lobar changes (70.8%), while the lower lobe was more commonly involved (17.7%) than the middle lobe/lingula (8.3%) and upper lobe (3.1%). In unilateral involvement, changes were more on the right (68.8%) than the left (31.2%) side. Compared with middle and old age groups, young adult patients showed significantly lesser frequency of consolidation (17% vs. 13.3% and 37%), diffuse changes 28.1% (14.2% vs. 35.3% and 40.5%), bilateral disease (71.4% vs. 94.1% and 85.2%), and multi-lobar involvement (51.4% vs. 82.4% and 81.4%) respectively. CONCLUSION: Bilateral and peripheral GGO were the most frequent findings with the right and lower lobar predilection.

To date, despite relentless efforts to control the disease by drug repurposing, there is no approved specific therapy for COVID-19. Given the role of innate and acquired immune components in the control and elimination of viral infections and inflammatory mutilations during SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis, immunotherapeutic strategies appear to be beneficent. Passive immunotherapies such as convalescent plasma, which has received much attention especially in severe cases, as well as suppressing inflammatory cytokines, interferon administration, inhibition of kinases and complement cascade, virus neutralization with key engineered products, cell-based therapies, immunomodulators and anti-inflammatory drugs are among the key immunotherapeutic approaches to deal with COVID-19, which is discussed in this review. Also, details of leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates as the most potent immunotherapy have been provided. However, despite salient improvements, there is still a lack of completely assured vaccines for universal application. Therefore, adopting proper immunotherapies according to the cytokine pattern and involved immune responses, alongside engineered biologics specially ACE2-Fc to curb SARS-CoV2 infection until achieving a tailored vaccine is probably the best strategy to better manage this pandemic. Therefore, gaining knowledge about the mechanism of action, potential targets, as well as the effectiveness of immune-based approaches to confront COVID-19 in the form of a well-ordered review study is highly momentous.","Bayat, Maryam; Asemani, Yahya; Mohammadi, Mohammad Reza; Sanaei, Mahsa; Namvarpour, Mozhdeh; Eftekhari, Reyhaneh",Int Immunopharmacol,565,23

We sought to examine whether the wall shear stress (WSS) values of LIMA grafts during the perioperative period reflected the 1-year patency by using combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) images. METHODS: CCTA was performed in 233 patients with LIMA graft perioperatively and 1 year later from October 2014 to May 2017. LIMA occlusion was detected in six patients at the 1-year follow-up CCTA. Two patients were excluded due to poor imaging quality. The remaining four patients were enrolled as occlusive (OCC) group, and eight patients with patent LIMA were recruited as patent (PAT) group. The WSS values of LIMA during perioperative period were calculated. LIMA graft was artificially divided into three even segments, proximal (pLIMA), middle (mLIMA) and distal (dLIMA) segments. The independent samples t-test and the Student-Newman-Keuls test were used. RESULTS: The WSS values of dLIMA were significantly higher in the PAT group than in the OCC group (4.43 vs. 2.56, p < 0.05). The WSS values of dLIMA in the PAT group were significantly higher than pLIMA, which was absent in the OCC group. CONCLUSIONS: A higher WSS value of the distal segment of LIMA and a higher WSS value of the distal segment compared with the proximal segment of LIMA in the PAT were observed; this tendency might be helpful in predicting the 1-year patency of LIMA.","Zhu, Lan; Pan, Zilai; Li, Zehang; Chang, Yunxiao; Zhu, Yunpeng; Yan, Fuhua; Tu, Shengxian; Yang, Wenjie",,565,24

For example, epidemiologists demonstrated 100% prevalence of dental caries in the Russian population followed by clinical manifestation of periodontal diseases. Inadequately provided oral health services in populations are caused by multi-factorial deficits including but not limited to low socio-economic status of affected individuals, lack of insurance in sub-populations, insufficient density of dedicated medical units. Another important aspect is the ""participatory"" medicine based on the active participation of population in maintaining oral health: healthcare will remain insufficient as long as the patient is not motivated and does not feel responsible for their oral health. To this end, nearly half of chronically diseased people do not comply with adequate medical services suffering from severely progressing pathologies. Noteworthy, the prominent risk factors and comorbidities linked to the severe disease course and poor outcomes in COVID-19-infected individuals, such as elderly, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, are frequently associated with significantly altered oral microbiome profiles, systemic inflammatory processes and poor oral health. Suggested pathomechanisms consider potential preferences in the interaction between the viral particles and the host microbiota including oral cavity, the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Since an aspiration of periodontopathic bacteria induces the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and production of inflammatory cytokines in the lower respiratory tract, poor oral hygiene and periodontal disease have been proposed as leading to COVID-19 aggravation. Consequently, the issue-dedicated expert recommendations are focused on the optimal oral hygiene as being crucial for improved individual outcomes and reduced morbidity under the COVID-19 pandemic condition. Current study demonstrated that age, gender, socio-economic status, quality of environment and life-style, oral hygiene quality, regularity of dental services requested, level of motivation and responsibility for own health status and corresponding behavioural patterns are the key parameters for the patient stratification considering person-tailored approach in a complex dental care in the population. Consequently, innovative screening programmes and adapted treatment schemes are crucial for the complex person-tailored dental care to improve individual outcomes and healthcare provided to the population.","Tachalov, V V; Orekhova, L Y; Kudryavtseva, T V; Loboda, E S; Pachkoriia, M G; Berezkina, I V; Golubnitschaja, O",EPMA J,565,24

This study focused on the differences in preventive behaviors and psycho-social health of South Koreans, as people continue engaging in leisure activities under self-regulation without a lockdown measure imposed by the government. For the sample, the frame of the ""2018 Population and Housing Census"" in South Korea was applied, and data from 1770 people were analyzed. The results showed that the groups participating in culture and arts and social activities displayed characteristics with high prevention. Additionally, the groups that continued leisure activities for more than five years and with family showed high preventive behaviors. Meanwhile, participation in leisure activities with friends of the opposite sex lowered preventive behavior. In terms of psycho-social health, all groups were affiliated to the potential stress group and there were no differences in the period and participation time for leisure activities. Furthermore, the group participating in leisure activities with their school and group experienced psychological stability. When lockdown measures are eased, the aforementioned characteristics should be considered to design government policy; they can also be used as a reference for public health in case of a future outbreak of an epidemic.","Kim, Young-Jae; Cho, Jeong-Hyung",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),565,21

The aim of this study is to examine the possible antiproliferative function of roe protein hydrolysates of Alburnus tarichi using enzymatic hydrolysis against breast cancer cells and explore its detailed mechanisms. In addition, we evaluated the effects of protein hydrolysate on the proliferation and apoptosis of two human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). The cultured cells were treated with protein hydrolysate at concentrations of 0-5 µg/ml for 24 h and 48 h. Inhibition of cell proliferation, percentage of apoptotic cells, cell cycle distribution, morphological changes, DNA fragmentation, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and apoptotic protein levels were also examined. Decreases in proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were observed after treatment with the protein hydrolysate in a dose-dependent manner. Distinct morphological changes, a typical pattern of fragmented DNA, and increased intracellular ROS production and apoptotic protein levels were observed in both cell lines after hydrolysate treatment (p < 0.05). The results suggested that the protein hydrolysate inhibits the proliferation of human breast cancer cell lines by introducing apoptosis through a caspase-dependent pathway in a dose-dependent manner.","Berköz, Mehmet; Özkan-Yilmaz, Ferbal; Özlüer-Hunt, Arzu; Krosniak, Miroslaw; Türkmen, Ömer; Yunusoglu, Oruç",Gen Physiol Biophys,565,2

METHODS: Cross sectional survey data was collected from 2,068 parents in the Northeastern US. Parents reported personal and household experiences of COVID-19 stressors, their level of distress, and use of neglectful parenting and discipline practices for a randomly selected child in their home. Analyses estimated rates of COVID-19 related stress and parenting practices. Logistic regression was used to assess the relation of COVID-19 stress to parenting behaviors. RESULTS: Individual and household stressor level, as well as distress were each positively associated with likelihood of neglect. Personal exposure to stressors was minimally related to discipline, but household stressor level and parents' distress were positively associated with harsh and positive discipline. DISCUSSION: Indicators of COVID-19 stress (e.g., exposure to stressors and distress) each uniquely predicted parents' use of neglect, particularly physical and family-based sub-types, and use of harsh and positive discipline practices. Results suggest that parents may require additional support to provide appropriate care for their children while coping with the increased rates of stress associated with the pandemic and the resulting public health response.","Connell, Christian M; Strambler, Michael J",Child Maltreat,565,16

Currently, there are over 95,000 complete genome sequences of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19, in public databases, accompanying a growing number of studies. Nevertheless, there is still much to learn about the viral population variation when the virus is evolving as it continues to spread. We have analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomes to identify the most variant sites, as well as the stable, conserved ones in samples collected in the Netherlands until June 2020. We identified the most frequent mutations in different geographies. We also performed a phylogenetic study focused on the Netherlands to detect novel variants emerging in the late stages of the pandemic and forming local clusters. We investigated the S and N proteins on SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the Netherlands and found the most variant and stable sites to guide development of diagnostics assays and vaccines. We observed that while the SARS-CoV-2 genome has accumulated mutations, diverging from reference sequence, the variation landscape is dominated by four mutations globally, suggesting the current reference does not represent the virus samples circulating currently. In addition, we detected novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 almost unique to the Netherlands that form localized clusters and region-specific sub-populations indicating community spread. We explored SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Netherlands until June 2020 within a global context; our results provide insight into the viral population diversity for localized efforts in tracking the transmission of COVID-19, as well as sequenced-based approaches in diagnostics and therapeutics. We emphasize that little diversity is observed globally in recent samples despite the increased number of mutations relative to the established reference sequence. We suggest sequence-based analyses should opt for a consensus representation to adequately cover the genomic variation observed to speed up diagnostics and vaccine design.","Urhan, Aysun; Abeel, Thomas",Sci Rep,565,22

The COVID-19 global pandemic has necessitated increased use of telehealth, but one limitation of telehealth is the inability to collect respiratory specimens. We initiated a protocol for at-home collection of oropharyngeal (OP) swabs from children with CF. METHODS: Home respiratory specimen collection was offered during telehealth encounters. Home OP swab kits were sent to participating families via mail with instructions for collection and return. Specimens were returned by overnight shipping or dropped off at a hospital lab for processing and culture. We evaluated demographic data and compared culture results from the home-collected specimen to the most recent specimen collected in clinic. We also tracked the frequency of newly identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: Home OP swab kits were sent to families of 33 children with CF (range 1.5-19 years). OP swab kits were successfully returned from 19 children (range 1.5-19 years). One or more CF pathogens grew from 79% of the specimens. For four individuals, the home collected specimen demonstrated the new growth of P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Home collection of OP swabs for bacterial culture is feasible in children with CF across a range of ages. Most home-collected specimens demonstrated growth of one or more CF pathogens and results were similar to recent in-clinic specimens, suggesting acceptable sample collection technique. Anti-pseudomonal therapy was initiated for four children based on the growth of P. aeruginosa from the home respiratory specimen.","Lenhart-Pendergrass, Patricia M; Anthony, Meg; Sariyska, Sabina; Andrews, Ashley; Scavezze, Heather; Towler, Elinor; Martiniano, Stacey L; Hoppe, Jordana E; Zemanick, Edith T",Pediatr. pulmonol,565,16

The viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or novel coronavirus or COVID-19 (CoV-19) is known as a pandemic. After SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related CoV, COVID-19 is the third most pathogenic virus, hazardous to humans which have raised worries concerning the capacity of current security measures and the human services framework to deal with such danger. Recent Findings: According to WHO, the mortality rate of COVID-19 exceeded that of SARS and MERS in view of which COVID-19 was declared as public health emergency of international concern. Coronaviruses are positive-sense RNA viruses with single stranded RNA and non-segmented envelopes. Recently, genome sequencing confirmed that COVID-19 is similar to SARS-CoV and bat coronavirus, but the major source of this pandemic outbreak, its transmission, and mechanisms related to its pathogenicity to humans are not yet known. Summary: In order to prevent the further pandemic and loss to humanity, scientists are studying the development of therapeutic drugs, vaccines, and strategies to cure the infections. In this review, we present a brief introduction to emerging and re-emerging pathogens, i.e., coronavirus in humans and animals, its taxonomic classification, genome organization, its replication, pathogenicity, impact on socioeconomic growth, and drugs associated with COVID-19.","Sood, Shivani; Aggarwal, Vaishali; Aggarwal, Diwakar; Upadhyay, Sushil K; Sak, Katrin; Tuli, Hardeep Singh; Kumar, Manoj; Kumar, Jayant; Talwar, Shivangi",Curr Pharmacol Rep,565,24

Patients with evidence of thromboembolism, high inflammatory markers and hypoxemia mainly required invasive ventilation. The 30-day in hospital mortality was 72.7% for the invasive group and 12.9% for the non-invasive group (1.8% oxygen &lt;10 L/min, 0.9% oxygen &gt;10 L/min, 3.6% rebreather mask and 4.5% BiPAP). The median time from hospital admission to outcome was 7 days for the invasive group and 18 days for the non-invasive group (P&lt;0.05). Age, presence of co-morbidities, number of days requiring oxygen, rebreather, BiPAP and invasive ventilation were independent predictors of outcome. Conclusions: Invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with adverse outcomes possibly due to ventilator associated lung injury. Thus, protective non-invasive ventilation remains the necessary and safe treatment for severely hypoxic COVID-19 patients. © 2021 Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine Produced by Wolters KluwerMedknow.

Several clinical trials are ongoing, but initial results have not been overly promising. Convalescent plasma (CP), which refers to plasma collected from individuals recovered from an illness and developed antibodies against the pathogen, is also being proposed as a therapeutic option for COVID-19 treatment in severe cases to achieve short-term immunity against the virus. Use of CP is not new, and it has been used in various outbreaks over the past century, ranging from the Spanish influenza outbreak in 1918 to the recent Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). However, data available on its use in COVID-19 patients is limited. Use of CP so far is restricted to a rescue therapy and needs further trials to assess its possible use in other situations (prevention, postexposure prophylaxis) and patient populations (considering age and comorbid illnesses). In this review, we will try to summarize the current status of use of CP for COVID-19 and ongoing trials in India and elsewhere and will discuss the possible avenues for its use in future.","Seshan, J.; Dube, S.

412212,412212,412212,Mechanical Ventilation Supply and Options for the COVID-19 Pandemic: Leveraging All Available Resources for a Limited Resource in a Crisis,18.999353,7.2327075,2020,"Background: In child and adolescent psychiatry departments, the number of hospitalizations for anorexia nervosa (AN) has been increasing in recent years. In the phase of severe undernutrition, these patients may exhibit disturbances in their immune functions. Based on this observation, many French practitioners had chosen to avoid long hospitalizations during the first wave of COVID-19. They had in mind a risk of contagion between adolescents, in which infections can be frequently asymptomatic. Fear of an increased risk of a severe form of COVID-19 in AN patients has led to early returns home, where they would probably be safer than in our departments. Is this strategy still relevant for the second wave? Has an increased risk of a severe form been identified in the adolescent AN patients? Method: We have recalled the French recommendations on the subject. Then we carried out a review of the international literature via Medline, Google Scholar as well as data from the American organization Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: The evolution of knowledge about the pandemic has clearly established a lower risk of infection in adolescents than in adults. It seems that the virus spares this population, most of them remaining asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic. Reassuringly, AN or low body weight has not been shown to pose a risk for the severe form of COVID-19. Conversely, the literature reports that lockdown worsens the symptoms of AN (food restriction, hyperactivity) in at least a third of these patients. Most of the patients expressed a high level of anxiety during the first lockdown. It may even have been difficult for these patients to continue to access care when they were confined. Conclusion: In the end, it seems wise not to reproduce the strategy of early return home in adolescents with AN. Current data support the need for continuity of care, as well as the continuation of hospital care when necessary, while a too rapid discharge runs the risk of destabilizing the patient in an already long and difficult course of care in the usual time. © 2021","Verley, J.

Semi-structured interviews with 14 teachers from various regions of Russia were conducted to investigate the characteristics of psychological stress and coping strategies in the context of the abrupt transition to distance learning imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In remote schooling, teachers have to implement education programs despite their own pandemic anxiety, provide emotional support to students, and stimulate their motivation for learning. It appears from the interview data that teacher stress is elevated by the absence or lack of support from school administrators and a substantial increase in teacher workload caused by the need to search for new techniques of teaching and preparing for classes from a distance, intensified communication with students and their parents, and the growing amount of homework assignments to review. The stress factors specific to the pandemic include the new work-from-home setup and changes in the work-life balance. The most common strategies of coping with stress and reducing its consequences include an effort to search for the silver lining and/or ne w opportunities, seeking social and emotional support, physical exercise, and hobby activities. © 2021, Mir Rossii All Rights Reserved.","Petrakova, A.; Kanonire, T.; Kulikova, A.; Orel, E.",Mir Rossii,565,17

In April 2020, the nation was shocked by the suicide of New York City emergency physician Dr. Lorna Breen, who died while recovering from COVID-19. She joins an unknown number of clinicians who have taken their lives over the past year. The authors introduce Dr. Breen, a highly talented physician working on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, and examine how pervasive distress and suicide are in clinicians. Then, they explain the lived experience movement and highlight how clinicians speaking openly about their mental illness and treatment are making it easier for their colleagues to seek lifesaving help, despite the stigma still surrounding mental illness and treatment in medicine. The authors sort through the science of clinician distress; critique how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the lives of clinicians; and describe existing national initiatives to address clinician stress, burnout, and suicide. Finally, they recommend evidence-based actions to prevent clinician suicide that multiple stakeholder groups can take, including regulatory agencies, licensing boards, and hospital privileging boards; specialty boards, professional associations, and continuing education organizations; medical educators; and individual clinicians. Suicide is a complex but generally preventable cause of death. Those in medicine must forge ahead with collective momentum. Dr. Breen, so many other clinicians, and those they have left behind deserve nothing less.","Moutier, Christine Yu; Myers, Michael F; Feist, Jennifer Breen; Feist, J Corey; Zisook, Sidney",Acad Med,565,1

The current study aimed to explore risk perceptions and precautionary behavior in response to COVID-19. METHOD: Qualitative in-depth interviews by telephone were undertaken with 26 participants from three affected cities in an initial stage of the disease outbreak, from May 3 to June 5, 2020. The method of analyzing data was inductive. The results were analyzed using interpretation, categorizing, and thematic analysis. RESULTS: The perception of risk is influenced by numerous individual, community, and cultural factors; these perceptions act as triggers for precautionary behavior, with a tendency to deny risks or react with exaggeration in terms of the precautionary reactions related to COVID-19. The thematic analysis produced two major categories: 1) risk perception and 2) precautionary behavior. The analysis provides essential insight into risk perception and precautionary behavior. CONCLUSION: The risk perceptions and patterns of precautionary behavior could be unreliable, unhealthy, and culturally affected, which would influence the effectiveness of pandemic control measures. Further investigations with more data and including risk perception and precautionary behavior in the national response plan for emergency and crisis are highly recommended. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: A greater understanding and ongoing assessment of COVID-19 risk perception could inform policymakers and health professionals who seek to promote precautionary behavior. This could also facilitate early interventions during pandemics.","Alqahtani, Mohammed M J; Arnout, Boshra A; Fadhel, Fahmi Hassan; Sufyan, Nabil Saleh SLeh",Patient educ. couns,565,16

In this article, the authors try to identify the actual scope and meaning of public health as it is institutionalized in the EU political system. Using a mixture of historical policy and legal analysis, the authors show how the evolution of the institutional space called public health in the EU has been shaped by the EU's distinctive constitutional nature, its focus on regulation, and the legacy of its focus on market making as well as the preferences of its political leaders. The European Union does have an increasingly large space named ""public health,"" in which health ministers, the health directorate-general, and invocation of its public health treaty article 168 can be found, as well as a much broader and older area of activities justified by the need to manage adverse health consequences of market-making policies in other areas such as labor standards and agriculture. The COVID-19 crisis of 2020 not only led to a strengthening of EU public health but also showed that the EU is one of the many political systems in which the legal and bureaucratic domain of public health is far smaller than the actual issues affecting the public's health.","Greer, Scott L; Jarman, Holly",J. health polit. policy law,565,1

In March 2020, as the COVID-19 surge began, an interdisciplinary group of administrators, providers, and trainees at Brigham and Women's Hospital created an inpatient virtual staffing model called the Virtual Team Rounding Program (VTRP). APPROACH: The conceptual framework guiding VTRP development was rapid-cycle innovation. The VTRP was designed iteratively using feedback from residents, physician assistants, attendings, and administrators from March to June 2020. The VTRP trained and deployed a diverse set of providers across specialties as ""virtual rounders"" to support inpatient teams by joining and participating in rounds via videoconference and completing documentation tasks during and after rounds. The program was rapidly scaled up from March to June 2020. OUTCOMES: In a survey of inpatient providers at the end of the pilot phase, 10/10 (100%) respondents reported they were getting either ""a lot"" or ""a little"" benefit from the VTRP and did not find the addition of the virtual rounder burdensome. During the scaling phase, the program grew to support 24 teams. In a survey at the end of the contraction phase, 117/187 (62.6%) inpatient providers who worked with a virtual rounder felt the rounder saved them time. VTRP leadership collaboratively and iteratively developed best practices for challenges encountered during implementation. NEXT STEPS: Virtual rounding provides a valuable extension of inpatient teams to manage COVID-19 surges. Future work will quantitatively and qualitatively assess the impact of the VTRP on inpatient provider satisfaction and well-being, virtual rounders' experiences, and patient care outcomes.","Becker, Nora V; Bakshi, Salina; Martin, Kate L; Bougrine, Amina; Andrade, Jonathan; Massey, Paul R; Hirner, Jesse P; Eccleston, Julie; Choudhry, Niteesh K; Britton, Kathryn; Landman, Adam B; Licurse, Adam M; Carlile, Narath; Mendu, Mallika L",Acad. med,565,27

The oral administration of RS in IFV-infected immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice suppressed viral proliferation in both mouse types. The oral administration of RS also had stimulatory effects on neutralizing antibody production.

This paper provides an initial understanding of some driving factors and their consequences. Since transmission requires people, the human factor behind globalisation is essential. Globalisation, a major force behind global well-being and equality, is highly associated with this factor. The analysis investigates the impact globalisation has on the speed of initial transmission to a country and on the scale of initial infections in the context of other driving factors. Our cross-country analysis finds that measures of globalisation are positively related to the spread of the virus, both in speed and in scale. However, the study also finds that globalised countries are better equipped to keep fatality rates low. The conclusion is not to reduce globalisation to avoid pandemics, but to better monitor the human factor at the outbreak and mobilise collaboration forces to curtail diseases.","Zimmermann, Klaus F.; Karabulut, Gokhan; Bilgin, Mehmet Huseyin; Doker, Asli Cansin",World Econ.,565,1

The COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique natural experiment because the source of unemployment is very likely to be exogenous to the individual. This study assessed the effect of job loss and job furlough on the mental health of individuals in South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. DATA AND METHODS: The data for the study came from the first and second waves of the national survey, the National Income Dynamics-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM), conducted during May-June and July-August 2020, respectively. The sample for NIDS-CRAM was drawn from an earlier national survey, conducted in 2017, which had collected data on mental health. Questions on depressive symptoms during the lockdown were asked in Wave 2 of NIDS-CRAM, using a 2-question version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). The PHQ-2 responses (0-6 on the discrete scale) were regrouped into four categories making the ordered logit regression model the most suited for assessing the impact of employment status on depressive symptoms. RESULTS: The study revealed that adults who retained paid employment during the COVID-19 lockdown had significantly lower depression scores than adults who lost employment. The benefits of employment also accumulated over time, underscoring the effect of unemployment duration on mental health. The analysis revealed no mental health benefits to being furloughed (on unpaid leave), but paid leave had a strong and significant positive effect on the mental health of adults. CONCLUSIONS: The economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented job losses, which impaired mental wellbeing significantly. Health policy responses to the crisis therefore need to focus on both physical and mental health interventions.","Posel, Dorrit; Oyenubi, Adeola; Kollamparambil, Umakrishnan",PLoS One,565,24

Drawing on literature at the intersection of critical tourism studies and resilience theory as well as interviews with local tourism practitioners and academics, four historically situated and place-based trends in Southeast Asia that are reshaping tourism in the region are outlined: livelihood diversification, ecosystem regeneration, cultural revitalization, and domestic tourism development. These trends highlight how the political economy of tourism in the region has both challenged and facilitated opportunities for reshaping the industry in (post-) pandemic times. These interconnected trends should not be understood in silo but rather as historically rooted and place-based experiences. The examples of resilience among Southeast Asian residents presented in the article demonstrate that local individuals and communities are active agents in resilience. While the concept of resilience has been applied widely by scholars from multiple disciplines during the COVID-19 pandemic, a critical tourism studies approach to resilience theory accounts for the historically situated nuances of local scale dynamics and their relationship to macro-level processes. Rather than simply focusing on the pandemic’s sudden transformative effects, practices of resilience in Southeast Asia reflect ongoing political-economic and cultural shifts that have often been underway in the region for several decades.

BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle formulated nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein locked in its prefusion conformation. A developmental and reproductive toxicity study was conducted in rats according to international regulatory guidelines. The full human BNT162b2 dose of 30 µg mRNA/dose (>300 times the human dose on a mg/kg basis) was administered intramuscularly to 44 female rats 21 and 14 days prior to mating and on gestation days 9 and 20. Half of the rats were subject to cesarean section and full fetal examination at the end of gestation, and the other half were allowed to deliver and were monitored to the end of lactation. A robust neutralizing antibody response was confirmed prior to mating and at the end of gestation and lactation. The presence of neutralizing antibodies was also confirmed in fetuses and offspring. Nonadverse effects, related to the local injection site reaction, were noted in dams as expected from other animal studies and consistent with observations in humans. There were no effects of BNT162b2 on female mating performance, fertility, or any ovarian or uterine parameters nor on embryo-fetal or postnatal survival, growth, physical development or neurofunctional development in the offspring through the end of lactation. Together with the safety profile in nonpregnant people, this ICH-compliant nonclinical safety data supports study of BNT162b2 in women of childbearing potential and pregnant and lactating women.","Bowman, Christopher J; Bouressam, Marie; Campion, Sarah N; Cappon, Gregg D; Catlin, Natasha R; Cutler, Mark W; Diekmann, Jan; Rohde, Cynthia M; Sellers, Rani S; Lindemann, Claudia",Reprod Toxicol,565,24

The development of an effective vaccine will take several months to become available, and its affordability is unpredictable. Transfusion of convalescent plasma (CP) may provide passive immunity. Based on initial data from China, a group of hematologists, infectious disease specialists, and intensivists drafted this protocol in March 2020. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to test the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of CP in treating patients with COVID-19 across Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Eligible patients with COVID-19 will be recruited for CP infusion according to the inclusion criteria. As COVID-19 has proven to be a moving target as far as its management is concerned, we will use current definitions according to the Ministry of Health (MOH) guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. All CP recipients will receive supportive management including all available recommended therapies according to the available MOH guidelines. Eligible CP donors will be patients with COVID-19 who have fully recovered from their disease according to MOH recovery criteria as detailed in the inclusion criteria. CP donors have to qualify as blood donors according to MOH regulations except for the history of COVID-19 in the recent past. We will also test the CP donors for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by a rapid test, and aliquots will be archived for future antibody titration. Due to the perceived benefit of CP, randomization was not considered. However, we will compare the outcome of the cohort treated with CP with those who did not receive CP due to a lack of consent or lack of availability. In this national collaborative study, there is a likelihood of not finding exactly matched control group patients. Hence, we plan to perform a propensity score matching of the CP recipients with the comparator group patients for the major characteristics. We plan to collect demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of both groups and compare the outcomes. A total sample size of 575 patients, 115 CP recipients and 460 matched controls (1:4 ratio), will be sufficient to detect a clinically important hospital stay and 30-day mortality difference between the two groups with 80% power and a 5% level of significance. RESULTS: At present, patient recruitment is still ongoing, and the interim analysis of the first 40 patients will be shared soon. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we present a protocol for a national collaborative multicenter phase II study in Saudi Arabia for assessing the feasibility, safety, and potential efficacy of CP in treating patients with severe COVID-19.

We analyze the seroprevalence surveys using a Bayesian method with an informative prior distribution on the seroprevalence parameter, and the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test. We construct the informative prior of the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test using the posterior distribution obtained from the clinical evaluation data. The constraint of the seroprevalence parameter induced from the known confirmed coronavirus 2019 cases can be imposed naturally in the proposed Bayesian model. We also prove that the confidence interval of the seroprevalence parameter based on the Rao's test can be the empty set, while the Bayesian method renders interval estimators with coverage probability close to the nominal level.

Moreover, as IBD is a lifelong condition, patients are frequently older with comorbidities, further increasing the potential risks of a more severe COVID-19 disease course.

We aimed to estimate the effect of the pandemic on the mental health of college students. METHODS: We used data on 419 first-year students (ages 18-20) at a large public university in North Carolina both before (October 2019-February 2020) and after (June/July 2020) the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. After evaluating descriptive data on mental health and stressors by students' demographic characteristics, we estimated the associations between Covid-19 stressors (including work reductions, health, distanced learning difficulties and social isolation) and mental health symptoms and severity controlling for students' pre-pandemic mental health, psychosocial resources, and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: We found that the prevalence of moderate-severe anxiety increased from 18.1% before the pandemic to 25.3% within four months after the pandemic began; and the prevalence of moderate-severe depression increased from 21.5% to 31.7%. White, female and sexual/gender minority (SGM) students were at highest risk of increases in anxiety symptoms. Non-Hispanic (NH) Black, female, and SGM students were at highest risk of increases in depression symptoms. General difficulties associated with distanced learning and social isolation contributed to the increases in both depression and anxiety symptoms. However, work reductions as well as Covid-19 diagnosis and hospitalization of oneself, family members or friends were not associated with increases in depression or anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSION: Colleges may be able to reduce the mental health consequences of Covid-19 by investing in resources to reduce difficulties with distance learning and reduce social isolation during the pandemic.","Fruehwirth, Jane Cooley; Biswas, Siddhartha; Perreira, Krista M",PLoS One,565,14

Primary outcome was residual respiratory dysfunction (RRD), defined by tachypnea, moderate to very severe dyspnea, or peripheral oxygen saturation &#8804;95% on room air at M3. RESULTS: RRD was found in 30.4% of patients, with no significant difference compared with M1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and length of stay were independent predictors of RRD at multivariable logistic regression (odds ratio, OR, [95% confidence interval, CI] 4.13 [1.17-16.88], p 0.033; OR [95% CI] 1.02 [1.00-1.04], p 0.047, respectively).

However, the majority of studies only accounted for frontline healthcare workers with direct patient exposure. AIM: This study aims to look at the psychological impact of COVID-19 in a specific, vulnerable and yet hidden group of healthcare workers, namely laboratory healthcare workers who are at high risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus from handling infected patients' blood samples, in addition to a marked increase in workload. METHOD: A multicentre study was conducted in Singapore via online questionnaire looking at psychological and physical impact of COVID-19 on laboratory healthcare workers. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Numeric rating scale on fear (NRS) were validated scores used in this study. Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software version 23 (IBM Corp). RESULTS: A total of 122 staffs participated and more than half of the cohort experienced mild to severe fear, anxiety and depression. Increase in depression score was also found to be associated with increased physical exhaustion (OR = 6.1, 95% CI 1.4-29.1, p = .02), loss of appetite (OR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.0, p = .02), poor sleep quality (OR = 7.5, 95% CI 2.9-19.4, p = .005), and the use of sedative (OR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.1-13.5, p = .03).

This study aimed at assess the status of occupational stress in the three occupational groups of nurses, physicians and hospital cleaning crew facing COVID-19 patients in hospitals of Kerman province in Iran. Methodology: : This cross-sectional descriptive analytical study was performed on 290 medical staffs including nurses, physicians and cleaning crew facing COVID-19 patients working in different hospitals in Iran in 2020. Demographic information form and occupational Stress Questionnaire (HSE tool indicator) were used to collect data. The health and safety executive (HSE) questionnaire has 35 questions and 7 areas, which was developed in the 1990s by the UK Health and Safety Institute to measure occupational stress. Results: The mean score of total dimensions among HCWs was 2.93. Communications, Manager support, Changes and Demand factors with scores of 2.76, 2.77, 2.83 and 2.87 had the greatest impact on participants' stress levels, respectively. Also, Colleague support factor with a score of 3.38 had the least effect on stress levels. Also, according to the results, 87% of nurses, 79% of cleaning crew and 67% of physicians had a partial to high levels of stress that, on average, 77.5% of the HCWs participating in this study had at least a small amount of stress. Conclusions: The mean stress score among the participants of the present study was between high stress level and moderate stress level. Factors such as communications, manager support, change and demand had the greatest impact on employee stress levels. Therefore, by improving the communication between people working in hospitals, increasing managers' support for staff, and reducing workplace demands such as reducing workload and improving workplace environment, the stress level of staff in hospitals during the outbreak of COVID-19 can be reduced.","Zare, Sajad; Mohammadi Dameneh, Moslem; Esmaeili, Reza; Kazemi, Reza; Naseri, Sahar; Panahi, Davoud",Heliyon,565,16

As COVID-19 vaccines are under development, public health officials and policymakers need to create strategic vaccine-acceptance messaging to effectively control the pandemic and prevent thousands of additional deaths. Methods: Using an online platform, we surveyed the U.S. adult population in May 2020 to understand risk perceptions about the COVID-19 pandemic, acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine, and trust in sources of information. These factors were compared across basic demographics. Findings: Of the 672 participants surveyed, 450 (67%) said they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine if it is recommended for them. Males (72%) compared to females, older adults (&#8805;55 years; 78%) compared to younger adults, Asians (81%) compared to other racial and ethnic groups, and college and/or graduate degree holders (75%) compared to people with less than a college degree were more likely to accept the vaccine. When comparing reported influenza vaccine uptake to reported acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine: 1) participants who did not complete high school had a very low influenza vaccine uptake (10%), while 60% of the same group said they would accept the COVID-19 vaccine; 2) unemployed participants reported lower influenza uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance when compared to those employed or retired; and, 3) Black Americans reported lower influenza vaccine uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance than all other racial groups reported in our study. Lastly, we identified geographic differences with Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regions 2 (New York) and 5 (Chicago) reporting less than 50 percent COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Interpretation: Although our study found a 67% acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine, there were noticeable demographic and geographical disparities in vaccine acceptance. Before a COVID-19 vaccine is introduced to the U.S., public health officials and policymakers must prioritize effective COVID-19 vaccine-acceptance messaging for all Americans, especially those who are most vulnerable.","Malik, Amyn A; McFadden, SarahAnn M; Elharake, Jad; Omer, Saad B",EClinicalMedicine,565,2

These were delivered ‘live’ to small groups of students in up to four simultaneous virtual classrooms on a 6-weekly rolling basis. We aimed to assess student and tutor feedback regarding the move to interactive online tutorials in addiction psychiatry.MethodTwo questionnaires sought feedback from students and tutors, focussing on the change from face-to-face to virtual teaching during a 20-week period.Result21 (of 161) students completed the questionnaire.• 100% ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that the content of the tutorial was relevant to learning outcomes.• 52% felt ‘somewhat comfortable’ unmuting their microphones to contribute verbally, contrasting to 24% feeling ‘not very’ or ‘extremely uncomfortable’.

Pune is the second city in the Maharashtra state after Mumbai to breach the 1000 cases. Total deaths reported from Pune were 158 with a mortality of 5.7%. To plan health services, it is important to learn lessons from early stage of the outbreak on course of the disease in a hospital setting. Objectives: To describe the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak of COVID-19 in India from a tertiary care hospital. Methods: This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study which included all admitted laboratory confirmed COVID19 cases from March 31, to April 24, 2020. The information was collected in a predesigned pro forma which included sociodemographic data, duration of stay, family background, outcome, etc., by trained staff after ethics approval. Epi Info7 was used for data analysis. Results: Out of the total 197 cases, majority cases were between the ages of 31-60 years with slight male preponderance. Majority of these cases were from the slums. Breathlessness was the main presenting symptom followed by fever and cough. More than 1/5th of patients were asymptomatic from exposure to admission. The case fatality rate among the admitted cases was 29.4%. Comorbidity was one of the significant risk factors for the progression of disease and death (odds ratio [OR] = 16.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.0 - 40.1, P < 0.0001). Conclusion: Mortality was higher than the national average of 3.2%; comorbidity was associated with bad prognosis.","Tambe, Muralidhar Parashuram; Parande, Malangori A; Tapare, Vinay S; Borle, Pradip S; Lakde, Rajesh N; Shelke, Sangita C",Indian J Public Health,565,3

As the Indian state is confronted by several challenges, the exodus of migrant labor appears as a gruesome spectacle. The already precarious lives of migrant labor owing to their employment in the informal economy has been amplified manifold with the outbreak of the pandemic. The eclipsed response of the state to acknowledge their misery has further exacerbated the problem. Since the state is entrusted with the responsibility of providing social security to the labor in the informal economy- a component that is also deemed necessary to be fulfilled by those the state seeks to govern, the pandemic has rendered the question of state’s legitimacy to be probed further. Defined as the capacity and the right to rule, the legitimacy of the state is analyzed from the perspective of the effective provision of social security schemes as well as the expedition/suspension of labor rights. While the state may possess the capacity to provide for social security, and it certainly does as is evident from its boisterous declarations of fiscal stimulus’ for labor welfare, it is argued that the state’s blatant lack of willingness to translate its promises into concrete action puts the “right to rule” aspect under scrutiny and its legitimacy under jeopardy. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.","Saxena, A.",India Review,565,20

This study aims to understand how the measures of lockdown have influenced noise levels, as well as people's perception of sound quality before and after lockdown, including de-escalation. For this purpose, an online survey was carried out. Moreover, the noise linked to the Global Positioning System (GPS) position of each individual respondent was recorded aiming to correlate the noise level with the result of the survey. An average reduction of over 30 dB was observed compared with the sound pressure level before lockdown. Furthermore, it was found that the loudness parameter, together with the overall level, increased as the country started relaxing restrictions. Additionally, results showed that the perception of noise quality changed depending on the phase of de-escalation (p < 0.01), the type of property (p < 0.05), and the outside noise (p < 0.01). Moreover, noise annoyance was determined considering age (p < 0.01), gender (p < 0.05), type of property (p < 0.001), and home refurbishment (p < 0.05). It may be concluded that the most important measure to decrease noise levels is the reduction of traffic noise, through using eco-friendly public transportation or bicycles and limiting nightlife hours.","Redel-Macías, María Dolores; Aparicio-Martinez, Pilar; Pinzi, Sara; Arezes, Pedro; Cubero-Atienza, Antonio José",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),565,16

By substituting residues in the RaTG13 RBD with their counterparts in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, we found that residue 501, the major position found in variants of concern (VOCs) 501Y.V1/V2/V3, plays a key role in determining the potential host range of RaTG13. We also found that SARS-CoV-2 could induce strong cross-reactive antibodies to RaTG13 and identified a SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), CB6, that could cross-neutralize RaTG13 pseudovirus. These results elucidate the receptor binding and host adaption mechanisms of RaTG13 and emphasize the importance of continuous surveillance of coronaviruses (CoVs) carried by animal reservoirs to prevent another spillover of CoVs.","Liu, Kefang; Pan, Xiaoqian; Li, Linjie; Yu, Feng; Zheng, Anqi; Du, Pei; Han, Pengcheng; Meng, Yumin; Zhang, Yanfang; Wu, Lili; Chen, Qian; Song, Chunli; Jia, Yunfei; Niu, Sheng; Lu, Dan; Qiao, Chengpeng; Chen, Zhihai; Ma, Dongli; Ma, Xiaopeng; Tan, Shuguang; Zhao, Xin; Qi, Jianxun; Gao, George F; Wang, Qihui",Cell,565,22

This review synthesizes the literature on COVID-19 pharmacotherapy to inform practice and policymaking. AREAS COVERED: The authors systematically review the published literature on COVID-19 therapeutics, grouping candidate treatments into repurposed, adjunct, and experimental agents. They conducted meta-analysis where appropriate and provide recommendations based on compilation from real-time/interim therapeutic guidelines. They then advise on how to navigate and advance the evidence in the current context of uncertainty and urgency and provide expert opinion on suggested framework. EXPERT OPINION: Current evidence does not support a clear role for pharmacotherapy in COVID-19. While promising signals have been found through limited number of RCTs, these must be interpreted with caution. Without proper protection from bias and confounding we risk exposing patients to treatments where the potential for benefit is at best unclear, yet the potential for harm from adverse effects is high leading to a trade-off dilemma in decision making. Advancing the evidence requires a coordinated effort to design and conduct robust trials and to systematically synthesize and critically evaluate findings. Therapies should be reserved for use in clinical trials, emergency or compassionate access until we gain more confidence in the balance of benefit and harm.","Khan, Sohil; Gionfriddo, Michael R; Cortes-Penfield, Nicolas; Thunga, Girish; Rashid, Muhammad",Expert Opin Pharmacother,565,16

The goal was to detect clinically unsuspected Covid-19 infections to prevent community spread. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted to recognize the pattern of metabolic and radiographic alterations on 18F-FDG PET/CT scans in Covid-19 patients. 492 18F-FDG PET/CT scans were reviewed for pulmonary and systemic abnormalities. RESULTS: 18F-FDG PET/CT demonstrated new lung infiltrates in 29 asymptomatic patients. 13/29 patients had Covid-19 infection confirmed by nasopharyngeal nucleic acid PCR test. The most common lung abnormality was pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) (90%) in peripheral distribution (100%), involving 1 lobe in four patients (30.8%), 2-3 lobes in four patients, and 4-5 lobes in five patients (38.4%). Mean SUVmax was 4.7 (range 1.3-13.1). Ten patients developed symptoms, mainly fever, fatigue, and dry cough, within 6.4 ± 7.8 days (range 1-24). Of the available laboratory data of 12 patients, eight developed lymphopenia, and five patients had neutrophilia. Five patients required hospitalization, and two died of complications. CONCLUSION: For a given geographic region in the later stage of a pandemic, such as Covid-19, community spread of the disease is common. Therefore, it is not surprising to find it in asymptomatic being imaged for other indications. Recognition of its manifestation and effectively mounting mitigation protocols is essential to further reduce SARS-CoV-2 spread, especially to susceptible groups, predominantly the elderly and people with comorbidities.","Bello Martinez, Ricardo; Ghesani, Munir; Ghesani, Nasrin; Gavane, Somali",Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences (Online),565,16

Previous health economic analysis found MRgFUS thalamotomy to be a cost-effective treatment for patients with essential tremor, supporting its reimbursement. With the publication of level I evidence in support of MRgFUS thalamotomy for patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease (TDPD), the authors performed a health economic comparison between MRgFUS, deep brain stimulation (DBS), and medical therapy. METHODS: The authors used a decision tree model with rollback analysis and one-factor sensitivity analysis. Literature searches of MRgFUS thalamotomy and unilateral DBS of the ventrointermediate nucleus of the thalamus for TDPD were performed to determine the utility and probabilities for the model. Costs in Canadian dollars (CAD) were derived from the Schedule of Benefits and Fees in Ontario, Canada, and expert opinion on usage. RESULTS: MRgFUS was associated with an expected cost of $14,831 CAD. Adding MRgFUS to continued medical therapy resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $30,078 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), which remained cost-effective under various scenarios in the sensitivity analysis. Comparing DBS to MRgFUS, while DBS did not achieve the willingness-to-pay threshold ($56,503 per QALY) in the base case scenario, it did so under several scenarios in the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: MRgFUS thalamotomy is a cost-effective treatment for patients with TDPD, particularly over continued medical therapy. While MRgFUS remains competitive with DBS, the cost-effectiveness advantage is less substantial. These results will help inform the integration of this technology in the healthcare system.","Meng, Ying; Pople, Christopher B; Kalia, Suneil K; Kalia, Lorraine V; Davidson, Benjamin; Bigioni, Luca; Li, Daniel Zhengze; Suppiah, Suganth; Mithani, Karim; Scantlebury, Nadia; Schwartz, Michael L; Hamani, Clement; Lipsman, Nir",J Neurosurg,565,26

A deeper investigation revealed age differences in loyalty and sanctity concerns for staying-at-home and social distancing, and in sanctity concerns only for wearing face masks. The findings document the innate intuitions that guide one's decision to comply with such behaviors.

The plasma pools were made up from donations collected in several different Italian regions from May 2017 to October 2020, i.e. in the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All plasma pools were initially tested for the qualitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein using the Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test kit. Plasma pools positive for these antibodies were further tested using the Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S test kit for the quantitative detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain. All plasma pools showing reactivity to these antibodies were tested undiluted for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the Grifols Procleix SARS-CoV-2 transcription-mediated amplification assay. Intravenous immunoglobulins were tested using both test kits to determine the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RESULTS: All plasma pools made up from donations collected in the pre-pandemic period were negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein. Of the plasma pools made up from donations collected from December 2018 to March 2020, only 1 pool out of 68 (1.4%), that was made up from donations from the Lombardy region, was reactive for these antibodies. Interestingly, 105 out of 174 (60.3%) of the plasma pools made up from donations collected from November 2018 to October 2020 showed the presence of these antibodies. All plasma pools positive for these antibodies were tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain and were confirmed positive. DISCUSSION: None of these plasma pools tested were reactive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

Objective: To estimate the association of age with the likelihood of developing symptoms and the association of age with the likelihood of progressing to critical illness after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study analyzed quarantined case contacts, identified between February 20 and April 16, 2020, in the Lombardy region of Italy. Contacts were monitored daily for symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, by either real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using nasopharyngeal swabs or retrospectively via IgG serological assays. Close contacts of individuals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were selected as those belonging to clusters (ie, groups of contacts associated with an index case) where all individuals were followed up for symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data were analyzed from February to June 2020. Exposure: Close contact with individuals with confirmed COVID-19 cases as identified by contact tracing operations. Main Outcomes and Measures: Age-specific estimates of the risk of developing respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 °C and of experiencing critical disease (defined as requiring intensive care or resulting in death) in SARS-CoV-2-infected case contacts. Results: In total, 5484 case contacts (median [interquartile range] age, 50 [30-61] years; 3086 female contacts [56.3%]) were analyzed, 2824 of whom (51.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (median [interquartile range] age, 53 [34-64] years; 1604 female contacts [56.8%]). The proportion of infected persons who developed symptoms ranged from 18.1% (95% CI, 13.9%-22.9%) among participants younger than 20 years to 64.6% (95% CI, 56.6%-72.0%) for those aged 80 years or older. Most infected contacts (1948 of 2824 individuals [69.0%]) did not develop respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 °C. Only 26.1% (95% CI, 24.1%-28.2%) of infected individuals younger than 60 years developed respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 °C; among infected participants older than 60 years, 6.6% (95% CI, 5.1%-8.3%) developed critical disease. Female patients were 52.7% (95% CI, 24.4%-70.7%) less likely than male patients to develop critical disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions and Relevance: In this Italian cohort study of close contacts of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, more than one-half of individuals tested positive for the virus. However, most infected individuals did not develop respiratory symptoms or fever. The low proportion of children and young adults who developed symptoms highlights the possible challenges in readily identifying SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Poletti, Piero; Tirani, Marcello; Cereda, Danilo; Trentini, Filippo; Guzzetta, Giorgio; Sabatino, Giuliana; Marziano, Valentina; Castrofino, Ambra; Grosso, Francesca; Del Castillo, Gabriele; Piccarreta, Raffaella; Andreassi, Aida; Melegaro, Alessia; Gramegna, Maria; Ajelli, Marco; Merler, Stefano",JAMA Netw Open,565,1

RESEARCH AIMS: The primary aim of this study was to determine changes to breastfeeding support services during the coronavirus-2019 pandemic according to trained lactation providers. The secondary aim was to assess strengths and limitations of telehealth services. METHODS: A prospective survey was conducted entirely online using the Qualtrics platform during June 2020. Gatekeepers at Connecticut agencies and breastfeeding networks were forwarded an anonymous survey link to distribute to eligible lactation staff. RESULTS: A variety of participants (N = 39) completed the survey and the majority (69.2%; n = 27) were providing only telehealth services. More than half (58.1%; n = 18) of the participants who conducting telehealth in any form, found that virtual lactation support was moderately effective compared to in-person support. Weakness of virtual support included technical and logistical difficulties, challenges assisting with latching or reading body language over the phone or online, and accurately assessing infant growth. Strengths related to virtual support included the flexibility and convenience of home-based support, expanded communication strategies, and safety from virus exposure. Further, visits with a lactation professional decreased significantly during the pandemic. Limited in-hospital and pediatrician support were also noted, particularly among groups without access to telehealth resources. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the pandemic and associated shifts in lactation services, breastfeeding disparities may be further exacerbated among those without equitable access to lactation support. Challenges and innovations in virtual support may influence adaptive options in the field moving forward.","Schindler-Ruwisch, Jennifer; Phillips, Kathryn E",J Hum Lact,565,16

Despite all benefits, there might be some threats for younger groups spending their time in quarantine. This study aims to determine the impacts of lockdown and school closure on children's major lifestyle aspects, especially their leisure and sleep pattern during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For the purpose of this study, an online questionnaire was distributed from 14th to 31st of March 2020 among the schools and students from the first grade to the 12th grade (before university) in Fars province, southern Iran. The questionnaire consisted of five sections which included data regarding the students' general information, activity priorities, adherence to quarantine, attitude toward school closure, and sleep patterns. RESULTS: In our study, 20,697 filled questionnaires were received from the participants with an average age of 13.76 years; 29.7% of them were male, 80.6% were from urban areas, and 83.3% were from public schools. The overall first preference of students during school closure was mobile and computer games (30.1%), followed by studying (26.6%) and watching television (13.8%). Our results demonstrated that the majority of students adhered to social distancing and there was also a significant correlation among education levels and desire for schools to be closed till the end of the semester (P = 0.015). Also, regarding sleep patterns, the majority (53.5%) had above 12 h of sleep throughout the day. CONCLUSION: It seems that lockdown following COVID-19 pandemic has changed various aspects of the students' lifestyle remarkably, especially by increasing screen time and even sleep duration and pattern. We believe that certain strategies should be implemented by the Health and Educational Ministry to control not only the visible side effects of the quarantine period, but also the collateral consequences on their psychological and mental health.","Ranjbar, Keivan; Hosseinpour, Hamidreza; Shahriarirad, Reza; Ghaem, Haleh; Jafari, Khoubyar; Rahimi, Tayebeh; Mirahmadizadeh, Alireza; Hosseinpour, Parisa",Environ Health Prev Med,565,16

Hence a product containing probiotics, propolis and cinnamon was developed and interferences of the ingredients were characterized. Yogurts were prepared using starter cultures with propolis (0.03%) and cinnamon in various concentrations (0.3%, 1%, and 2.5%). Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were used as microorganisms for yogurt production. Chemical analysis revealed a decline of fat matter in the presence of propolis and/or cinnamon. Propolis had statistically significant suppressive effects on Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis as well as on Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus numbers (p < 0.05). These effects were diminished in the presence of increasing cinnamon concentrations. For Lactobacillus acidophilus a statistically significant reducing effect on the number of colonies was observed in all products investigated. Nevertheless all samples met the standard of recommended level of ≥ 106 viable cells/g of a product. Propolis showed an inverse effect on Streptococcus thermophilus by increasing its colony numbers in yogurts.

During the global vaccination rollout, it is vital to thoroughly understand the modes of transmission of the virus in order to prevent further spread of variants and ultimately to end the pandemic. The current literature suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted among the human population primarily through respiratory droplets and, to a lesser extent, via aerosols. Transmission appears to be affected by temperature, humidity, precipitation, air currents, pH, and radiation in the ambient environment. Finally, the use of masks or facial coverings, social distancing, and hand washing are effective public health strategies in reducing the risk of exposure and transmission. Additional research is needed to further characterize the relative benefits of specific nonpharmaceutical interventions.","Zhou, Lucas; Ayeh, Samuel K; Chidambaram, Vignesh; Karakousis, Petros C",BMC Infect Dis,565,16

To develop a deeper understanding of the contribution of PM2.5 in the propagation of the SAR-CoV-2 virus in the population, the deposition patterns and efficiencies (DEs) of PM2.5 laced with the virus in healthy and asthmatic airways are studied. Physiologically correct 3-D models for generations 10-12 of the human airways were applied to carry out a numerical analysis of two-phase flow for full breathing cycles. Two concentrations of PM2.5 were applied for the simulation, i.e., 30 µgâ m-3 and 80 µgâ m-3 for three breathing statuses, i.e., rest, light exercise, and moderate activity. All the PM2.5 injected into the control volume was assumed to be 100% contaminated with the SAR-CoV-2 virus. Skewed air-flow phenomena at the bifurcations were proportional to the Reynolds number at the inlet, and their intensity in the asthmatic airway exceeded that of the healthy one. Upon exhalation, two peak air-flow vectors from daughter branches combined to form one big vector in the parent generation. Asthmatic airway models had higher deposition efficiencies (DEs) for contaminated PM2.5 as compared to the healthy ones. Higher DEs arose in the asthmatic airway model due to complex secondary flows which increased the impaction of contaminated PM2.5 on airways' walls.","Chen, Wei-Hsin; Mutuku, Justus Kavita; Yang, Zhe-Wei; Hwang, Chii-Jong; Lee, Wen Jhy; Ashokkumar, Veeramuthu",Environ Res,565,1

Design and method: Retrospective, single-center observational study included 76 confirmed cases of COVID-19 associated with pneumonia (April-May 2020). Gr.1 consisted of 32 patients without AH;Gr.2 involved 44 AH patients, including 18 patients with metabolic disorders (abdominal obesity and impaired carbohydrate metabolism). Complete blood count, biochemical and hemostatic parameters were determined on the day of admission. Comprehensive analysis of clinical instrumental and laboratory parameters, including blood pressure, heart rate, IgG (positivity rate), cytokines, NT-pro BNP, endothelial dysfunction markers, cystatin C, glucose and others was performed in 3 months after discharge. Results: In Gr.1, IgG was negatively associated with hemoglobin, red blood cell volume, neutrophils, creatine phosphokinase, homocysteine, those were supplemented by NT-pro BNP, interleukin-6, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine (p&lt;0.0001-0.034) in Gr.2 and additionally, D-dimer level, transforming growth factor and P-selectin (p &lt;0.001-0.036) in metabolic disorders subgroup.

To better understand the relationship between genomic make-up and different lifestyles, we have de novo sequenced a burnettii homokaryon and synchronised gene annotations with updated versions of the published genomes of var. bisporus. The genomes were assembled into telomere-to-telomere chromosomes and a consistent set of gene predictions was generated. The genomes of both subspecies were largely co-linear, and especially the chromosome ends differed in gene model content between the two subspecies. A single large cluster of repeats was found on each chromosome at the same respective position in all strains, harbouring nearly 50% of all repeats and likely representing centromeres. Repeats were all heavily methylated. Finally, a mapping population of var. burnettii confirmed an even distribution of crossovers in meiosis, contrasting the recombination landscape of var. bisporus. The new findings using the exceptionally complete and well annotated genomes of this basidiomycete demonstrate the importance for unravelling genetic components underlying the different life cycles.","Sonnenberg, Anton S M; Sedaghat-Telgerd, Narges; Lavrijssen, Brian; Ohm, Robin A; Hendrickx, Patrick M; Scholtmeijer, Karin; Baars, Johan J P; van Peer, A",Sci Rep,565,32

The pathophysiology of ARDS results from acute inflammation within the alveolar space and prevention of normal gas exchange. The increase in proinflammatory cytokines within the lung leads to recruitment of leukocytes, further propagating the local inflammatory response. A consistent finding in ARDS is the deposition of fibrin in the air spaces and lung parenchyma. COVID-19 patients show elevated D-dimers and fibrinogen. Fibrin deposits are found in the lungs of patients due to the dysregulation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems. Tissue factor (TF) is exposed on damaged alveolar endothelial cells and on the surface of leukocytes promoting fibrin deposition, while significantly elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) from lung epithelium and endothelial cells create a hypofibrinolytic state. Prophylaxis treatment of COVID-19 patients with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is important to limit coagulopathy. However, to degrade pre-existing fibrin in the lung it is essential to promote local fibrinolysis. In this review, we discuss the repurposing of fibrinolytic drugs, namely tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), to treat COVID-19 associated ARDS. tPA is an approved intravenous thrombolytic treatment, and the nebulizer form has been shown to be effective in plastic bronchitis and is currently in Phase II clinical trial. Nebulizer plasminogen activators may provide a targeted approach in COVID-19 patients to degrade fibrin and improving oxygenation in critically ill patients.","Whyte, Claire S; Morrow, Gael B; Mitchell, Joanne L; Chowdary, Pratima; Mutch, Nicola J",J Thromb Haemost,565,2

Even though many studies have shown the host defense mechanism induced by inflammasome against various viral infections, mechanistic interactions leading to downstream cellular responses and pathogenesis in COVID-19 remain unclear. The SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with numerous cardiovascular disorders including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism. The inflammatory response triggered by the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome under certain cardiovascular conditions resulted in hyperinflammation or the modulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 signaling pathways.

We conducted a systematic review, meta-analysis, trial sequential analysis (TSA), and meta-regression of randomized-controlled trials to ascertain the benefit of IL-6 blockade with tocilizumab for COVID-19. METHODS: We included randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) allocating patients with COVID-19 to tocilizumab. Our control group included standard care or placebo. Trials co-administering other pharmacological interventions for COVID-19 were not excluded. Primary outcome was 28-30 day mortality. Secondary outcomes included progression-to-severe disease defined as need for mechanical ventilation, intensive-care unit (ICU) admission, or a composite. RESULTS: We identified 10 RCTs using tocilizumab, 9 of which reported primary outcome data (mortality), recruiting 6493 patients with 3358 (52.2%) allocated to tocilizumab.

We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization to clarify their role in COVID-19 risk and specific COVID-19 phenotypes (hospitalized and severe cases). METHOD: We identified genetic instruments for fasting glucose (n = 133,010), 2 h glucose (n = 42,854), glycated hemoglobin (n = 123,665), and type 2 diabetes (74,124 cases and 824,006 controls) from genome wide association studies and applied them to COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative summary statistics (17,965 COVID-19 cases and 1,370,547 population controls). We used inverse variance weighting to obtain the causal estimates of glycemic traits and genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes in COVID-19 risk. Sensitivity analyses included MR-Egger and weighted median method. RESULTS: We found genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes was not associated with any COVID-19 phenotype (OR: 1.00 per unit increase in log odds of having diabetes, 95%CI 0.97 to 1.04 for overall COVID-19; OR: 1.02, 95%CI 0.95 to 1.09 for hospitalized COVID-19; and OR: 1.00, 95%CI 0.93 to 1.08 for severe COVID-19). There were no strong evidence for an association of glycemic traits in COVID-19 phenotypes, apart from a potential inverse association for fasting glucose albeit with wide confidence interval. CONCLUSION: We provide some genetic evidence that poorer glycemic traits and predisposition to type 2 diabetes unlikely increase the risk of COVID-19.

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population in late 2019, it has spread on an unprecedented scale worldwide leading to the first coronavirus pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a wide range of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic to fatal cases. Although intensive research has been undertaken to increase understanding of the complex biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the detailed mechanisms underpinning the severe pathogenesis and interactions between the virus and the host immune response are not well understood. Thus, the development of appropriate animal models that recapitulate human clinical manifestations and immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 is crucial. Although many animal models are currently available for the study of SARS-CoV-2 infection, each has distinct advantages and disadvantages, and some models show variable results between and within species. Thus, we aim to discuss the different animal models, including mice, hamsters, ferrets, and non-human primates, employed for SARS-CoV-2 infection studies and outline their individual strengths and limitations for use in studies aimed at increasing understanding of coronavirus pathogenesis. Moreover, a significant advantage of these animal models is that they can be tailored, providing unique options specific to the scientific goals of each researcher.","Casel, M. A. B.; Rollon, R.

We investigated whether adolescents in Oslo reported compliance with the Norwegian infection control rules during the pandemic and whether compliance with the rules was associated with sociodemographic characteristics, trust in the authorities and acceptance of the infection control rules. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Students in lower and upper secondary schools completed an electronic questionnaire (N = 12 686, 37 % response rate) during a period with strict infection control measures in force. We used self-reporting of compliance with the infection control rules, sociodemographic characteristics, trust in the authorities and people in general, and acceptance of the infection control rules. We used logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The majority reported that they always or to a large extent complied with the rules for hand washing (n = 9 915, 84 %), refrained from shaking hands/hugging (n = 8 730, 74 %) and avoided large groups (n = 8 565, 73 %). Fewer reported to maintain physical distance (n = 5 859, 50 %). The level of trust in the government (n = 8 742, 80 %) and health authorities (n = 9 962, 92 %) was high. The highest compliance with the rules was among girls, adolescents from immigrant backgrounds, those with a high level of trust in the authorities and people in general, and those who showed acceptance of the infection control rules. INTERPRETATION: A large proportion reported to comply with the infection control rules. Adolescents from immigrant backgrounds and those who were living in the outer eastern suburbs of Oslo also more frequently reported to comply with the rules.

Data regarding efficacy of interventions, in terms of mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation, were extracted from identified studies and synthesised qualitatively. In total, 42 clinical trials were included. Interventions assessed included antiviral, mucolytic, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapies. Some reductions in mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation were seen with interferons and remdesivir, particularly when administered early, and with the mucolytic drug, bromhexine. Most studies of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine did not show significant efficacy over standard care/placebo. Dexamethasone significantly reduced mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation versus standard care, particularly in patients with severe disease. Evidence for other classes of interventions was limited.

PURPOSE: There is a growing need for specialty pharmacy leaders within integrated delivery networks (IDNs). Traditional training for students and residents has not met the demand for pharmacy leaders in this space. This article describes the partnership between UW Health (UWH) and the University of Wisconsin School of Pharmacy (UWSOP) in developing a specialty pharmacy elective course at UWSOP and in creating a postgraduate residency training program at UWH. Future directions for the partnership are discussed. SUMMARY: Members of the leaderships of UWH and UWSOP met to discuss expanding coursework related to specialty pharmacy business fundamentals at UWSOP. This meeting led to the development of a 2-credit elective course beginning in spring 2017. The course focused on marketplace economics, channel strategies, and specialty pharmacy practice development. Additionally, UWH identified the need to provide postgraduate training to meet the increasing demand across IDNs for specialty pharmacy leaders. The residency program was initiated in 2013 and received accreditation in 2016. The residency provides experience in specialty pharmacy leadership, managed care, finance, the revenue cycle, accreditation, and the supply chain. Future partnership opportunities include creation of a longitudinal student pharmacist track and joint project coordination between UWSOP students and UWH residents. CONCLUSION: This partnership has provided a pathway for students to gain expertise in specialty pharmacy business fundamentals as well as postgraduate training opportunities for future specialty pharmacy leaders.

METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated in patients with COVID-19 hospitalised at the Fatebenefratelli-Sacco Hospital in Milan, the prevalence of hypoalbuminemia, its association with the severity of COVID-19, with the levels of C-reactive protein, d-dimer and interleukin-6 and with clinical outcome over a follow-up period of 30 days. Urinalysis was evaluated in a subgroup of patients. RESULTS: Serum albumin levels <30 g/L were found in 105/207 (50.7%) patients at hospital admission. Overall, the median albumin value was 29.5 g/L (IQR 25-32.8). A negative association was found between albumin levels and severity of COVID-19 (P < .0001) and death (P = .003). An inverse correlation was observed between albumin and both C-reactive protein and D-dimer at hospital admission (r = -.487 and r = -.479, respectively; P < .0001). Finally, a positive correlation was found between albumin levels and eGFR (r = .137; P = .049). Proteinuria was observed in 75% of patients with available data and it did not differ between patients with hypoalbuminemia and those with albumin &#8805;30 g/L (81% and 67%, respectively; P = .09). CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19, hypoalbuminemia is common and observed in quite an early stage of pulmonary disease. It is strictly associated with inflammation markers and clinical outcome. The common finding of proteinuria, even in the absence of creatinine increase, indicates protein loss as a possible biomarker of local and systemic inflammation worthwhile to evaluate disease severity in COVID-19.","Bassoli, Cinzia; Oreni, Letizia; Ballone, Elisabetta; Foschi, Antonella; Perotti, Andrea; Mainini, Annalisa; Casalini, Giacomo; Galimberti, Laura; Meroni, Luca; Antinori, Spinello; Milazzo, Laura",Int J Clin Pract,565,33

Their genome contains a large replicase ORF which encodes nonstructural proteins (NSPs), structural, and accessory genes. NSP15 is a nidoviral RNA uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) with C-terminal catalytic domain. The endoribonuclease activity of NSP15 interferes with the innate immune response of the host. Here, we screened Selleckchem Natural product database of the compounds against NSP15, and we found that thymopentin and oleuropein displayed highest binding energies. The binding of these molecules was further validated by molecular dynamic simulations that revealed them as very stable complexes. These drugs might serve as effective counter molecules in the reduction of virulence of this virus; may be more effective if treated in combination with replicase inhibitors.

The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate efficacy/safety of the treatments in subgroups of patients with comorbidity under psychological support. Methods The primary endpoint was the temporal reduction of urinary positivity to the substance of abuse evaluated every three months, expressed as a percentage of responders out of the total number of recruits. Secondary endpoints were: the safety assessment. Psychopathology was assessed by ASI, Scl90, and a novel COVID-19 questioner. Results To date, 211 patients have been recruited, made up of 81% by males with an average age of 44.41 +5.24 and 19% by females with an average age of 43.16 + 2.89, over 98% of patients recruited are of Italian Caucasian. At recruitment, 75% of patients were already on treatment, most of them from less than (&gt; 80%) to 1 year. 20% + 1.3, 12% + 5.9, 7%+5, and 5% + 0.9 had psychiatric, infectious, cardiological, and metabolic comorbidity. At enrollment, 65% of female patients were treated with rac-methadone at a mean dose of 55 mg + 10 mg/day, 35% were treated with levomethadone at the dose of 45.11 mg + 6.5 mg/ day and the rest were treated with buprenorphine/naloxone at a dosage of 4 mg + 2.62 mg/day. In the male group, 50% of patients were treated with rac-methadone with a mean dosage of 57.21 mg +10.88 mg/day, 25% were treated with levomethadone with a mean dosage of 28.75 mg + 7.5 mg/day and the rest were treated with buprenorphine/naloxone at a mean dosage of 8 mg +3.62 mg/day. The starting Craving was respectively 32/100 in males and 31/100 in females, according to VAS. Out of 30% of patients who have completed their visits to date, 180 days after recruitment showed stability in urinary methadone positivity with a marked decrease in heroin positivity -53% + 4%, cannabinols -48% + 2% and cocaine -37% + 6%. The observed ADRs were: constipation, muscle fatigue, and one case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. 60 patients at enrollment showed a mean QTc of 430.2 +12.4, mean BPM of 75.23 + 5.3, systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 122.5 + 2.14 and 81.4 + 3.3 mmHg respectively, which remained unchanged. Adverse events of any nature were: decreased willpower, job loss, increased alcohol use, changes in personality including dullness and depression. Conclusion The patients were stabilized after 180 days of observation in our SERDs with a marked decreased dosing of levomethadone in males but with minor dosing reduction in the female.

Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to analyze open-ended semi-structured interviews conducted with five higher education faculty in Saudi Arabia. Three major themes were identified: Enhancing student engagement;increased awareness of technology affordances and constraints;and moving from emergency remote teaching to technology-enhanced and blended learning. Participants of this study were mainly concerned about finding ways to support active student engagement in this new learning environment, which in turn increased their awareness of the educational affordances and constraints of online learning and technologies. Participants’ deeper understanding of the potential of online technologies in supporting student learning, as well as their own and students’ increased familiarity and comfort with online learning and technologies, served as the main drivers for potential future implementation of blended learning and technologyenhanced teaching practices. With that said, participants were still apprehensive about engaging in fully online teaching, arguing that blended strategies and enhanced-technology integration are more likely to overcome some of the limitations of face-to-face teaching and improve the overall learning experience for their students.

This study aimed to detect impaired muscle efficiency by evaluating delta efficiency (DE) in patients with COVID-19 compared with subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ischaemic heart disease (IHD), and control group (CG). METHODS: A total of 60 participants were assigned to four experimental groups: COVID-19, COPD, IHD, and CG (n = 15 each group). Incremental exercise tests in a cycle ergometer were performed to obtain peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak). DE was obtained from the end of the first workload to the power output where the respiratory exchange ratio was 1. RESULTS: A lower DE was detected in patients with COVID-19 and COPD compared with those in CG (P &#8804; 0.033). However, no significant differences were observed among the experimental groups with diseases (P > 0.05). Lower VO2 peak, peak ventilation, peak power output, and total exercise time were observed in the groups with diseases than in the CG (P < 0.05). A higher VO2 , ventilation, and power output were detected in the CG compared with those in the groups with diseases at the first and second ventilatory threshold (P < 0.05). A higher power output was detected in the IHD group compared with those in the COVID-19 and COPD groups (P < 0.05) at the first and second ventilatory thresholds and when the respiratory exchange ratio was 1. A significant correlation (P < 0.001) was found between the VO2 peak and DE and between the peak power output and DE (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 showed marked mechanical inefficiency similar to that observed in COPD and IHD patients. Patients with COVID-19 and COPD showed a significant decrease in power output compared to IHD during pedalling despite having similar response in VO2 at each intensity. Resistance training should be considered during the early phase of rehabilitation.","Pleguezuelos, Eulogio; Del Carmen, Amin; Llorensi, Gemma; Carcole, Jessica; Casarramona, Paula; Moreno, Eva; Ortega, Pilar; Serra-Prat, Mateo; Palomera, Elisabet; Miravitlles, Marc M; Yebenes, Joan Carles; Boixeda, Ramón; Campins, Lluis; Villelabeitia-Jaureguizar, Koldo; Garnacho-Castaño, Manuel Vicente",J. cachexia sarcopenia muscle (Internet),565,16

The methodology includes two approaches: (i) the implementation of EGARCH, GJR-GARCH, and TGARCH models to estimate the volatilities;and (ii) analysis of randomness in volatilities series, return series, and PSX-100 closing prices for pre-pandemic and pandemic period by using Shannon’s, Tsallis, approximate and sample entropies. Volatility modeling suggests the existence of the leverage effect in both the underlying periods of study. The results obtained using GARCH modeling reveal that the stock market volatility has increased during the pandemic period. However, information-theoretic results based on Shannon and Tsallis entropies do not suggest notable variation in the estimated volatilities series and closing prices.

On one side, scientists are focusing on vaccinations, and on the other side, there is a need to propose models that can help us in understanding the spread of these pandemics as it can help governmental and other concerned agencies to be well prepared, especially from pandemics, which spreads faster like COVID-19. The main reason for some epidemic turning into pandemics is the connectivity among different regions of the world, which makes it easier to affect a wider geographical area, often worldwide. In addition, the population distribution and social coherence in the different regions of the world is non-uniform. Thus, once the epidemic enters a region, then the local population distribution plays an important role. Inspired by these ideas, we proposed a mobility-based SIR model for epidemics, which especially takes into account pandemic situations. To the best of our knowledge, this model is first of its kind, which takes into account the population distribution and connectivity of different geographic locations across the globe.

Host immune responses to CoVs are complex and regulated in part through antiviral interferons. However, interferon-stimulated gene products that inhibit CoVs are not well characterized4. Here, we show that lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E) potently restricts infection by multiple CoVs, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. Mechanistic studies revealed that LY6E inhibits CoV entry into cells by interfering with spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, mice lacking Ly6e in immune cells were highly susceptible to a murine CoV-mouse hepatitis virus. Exacerbated viral pathogenesis in Ly6e knockout mice was accompanied by loss of hepatic immune cells, higher splenic viral burden and reduction in global antiviral gene pathways. Accordingly, we found that constitutive Ly6e directly protects primary B cells from murine CoV infection. Our results show that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis. These findings advance our understanding of immune-mediated control of CoV in vitro and in vivo-knowledge that could help inform strategies to combat infection by emerging CoVs.","Pfaender, Stephanie; Mar, Katrina B; Michailidis, Eleftherios; Kratzel, Annika; Boys, Ian N; V039,; kovski, Philip; Fan, Wenchun; Kelly, Jenna N; Hirt, Dagny; Ebert, Nadine; Stalder, Hanspeter; Kleine-Weber, Hannah; Hoffmann, Markus; Hoffmann, Hans-Heinrich; Saeed, Mohsan; Dijkman, Ronald; Steinmann, Eike; Wight-Carter, Mary; McDougal, Matthew B; Hanners, Natasha W; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Gallagher, Tom; Todt, Daniel; Zimmer, Gert; Rice, Charles M; Schoggins, John W; Thiel, Volker",Nat Microbiol,565,20

Phone interview surveys were conducted by trained enumerators across 12 states and 200 districts in India from 3 to 15 May 2020. A total of 1437 farmers completed the survey (94% male; 28% 30-39 years old; 38% with secondary schooling). About one in ten farmers (11%) did not harvest in the past month with primary reasons cited being unfavorable weather (37%) and lockdown-related reasons (24%). A total of 63% of farmers harvested in the past month (primarily wheat and vegetables), but only 44% had sold their crop; 12% were still trying to sell their crop, and 39% had stored their crop, with more than half (55%) reporting lockdown-related issues as the reason for storing. Seventy-nine percent of households with wage-workers witnessed a decline in wages in the past month and 49% of households with incomes from livestock witnessed a decline. Landless farmers were about 10 times more likely to skip a meal as compared to large farmers (18% versus 2%), but a majority reported receiving extra food rations from the government. Nearly all farmers reported consuming staple grains daily in the past week (97%), 63% consumed dairy daily, 40% vegetables daily, 26% pulses daily, and 7% fruit daily. These values are much lower than reported previously for farmers in India around this time of year before COVID-19: 94-95% dairy daily, 57-58% pulses daily, 64-65% vegetables daily, and 42-43% fruit daily. In conclusion, we found that the COVID-19 lockdown in India has primarily impacted farmers' ability to sell their crops and livestock products and decreased daily wages and dietary diversity.

It has been postulated that anakinra, a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, might help to neutralise the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related hyperinflammatory state, which is considered to be one cause of acute respiratory distress among patients with COVID-19. We aimed to assess the off-label use of anakinra in patients who were admitted to hospital for severe forms of COVID-19 with symptoms indicative of worsening respiratory function. Methods: The Ana-COVID study included a prospective cohort from Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint-Joseph (Paris, France) and a historical control cohort retrospectively selected from the Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint-Joseph COVID cohort, which began on March 18, 2020. Patients were included in the prospective cohort if they were aged 18 years or older and admitted to Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint-Joseph with severe COVID-19-related bilateral pneumonia on chest x-ray or lung CT scan. The other inclusion criteria were either laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 or typical lung infiltrates on a lung CT scan, and either an oxygen saturation of 93% or less under oxygen 6 L/min or more, or aggravation (saturation ≤93% under oxygen 3 L/min) with a loss of 3% of oxygen saturation in ambient air over the previous 24 h. The historical control group of patients had the same inclusion criteria. Patients in the anakinra group were treated with subcutaneous anakinra (100 mg twice a day for 72 h, then 100 mg daily for 7 days) as well as the standard treatments at the institution at the time. Patients in the historical group received standard treatments and supportive care. The main outcome was a composite of either admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for invasive mechanical ventilation or death. The main analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis (including all patients in the anakinra group who received at least one injection of anakinra). Findings: From March 24 to April 6, 2020, 52 consecutive patients were included in the anakinra group and 44 historical patients were identified in the Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint-Joseph COVID cohort study. Admission to the ICU for invasive mechanical ventilation or death occurred in 13 (25%) patients in the anakinra group and 32 (73%) patients in the historical group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·22 [95% CI 0·11–0·41; p&lt;0·0001). The treatment effect of anakinra remained significant in the multivariate analysis (HR 0·22 [95% CI 0·10–0·49]; p=0·0002). An increase in liver aminotransferases occurred in seven (13%) patients in the anakinra group and four (9%) patients in the historical group. Interpretation: Anakinra reduced both need for invasive mechanical ventilation in the ICU and mortality among patients with severe forms of COVID-19, without serious side-effects. Confirmation of efficacy will require controlled trials.

This study examines the mental health impact of the pandemic on high school students shortly after closure of public schools in spring 2020, and whether this impact varies by sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and grade level. METHODS: A cross-sectional, one-time online survey was completed by racial/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse students in 9th through 12th grade at 2 semi-rural Georgia public high schools (N = 761). RESULTS: Overall, almost one-fourth of high school students were extremely or very worried about the pandemic, with higher rates of worry among students who are racial/ethnic minorities, lower SES, female and in older grades. Results indicated a concerning impact on the stress, anxiety, depression, and loneliness that students are feeling, particularly among girls and those in older grades. Students of color and low SES, who are already disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, are also more likely to experience mental health challenges.

Their residents also are at higher risk than the general population for morbidity and mortality associated with infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in light of the association of severe outcomes with older age and certain underlying medical conditions (1,3). CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) launched nationwide, facility-level COVID-19 nursing home surveillance on April 26, 2020. A federal mandate issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), required nursing homes to commence enrollment and routine reporting of COVID-19 cases among residents and staff members by May 25, 2020. This report uses the NHSN nursing home COVID-19 data reported during May 25-November 22, 2020, to describe COVID-19 rates among nursing home residents and staff members and compares these with rates in surrounding communities by corresponding U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) region.* COVID-19 cases among nursing home residents increased during June and July 2020, reaching 11.5 cases per 1,000 resident-weeks (calculated as the total number of occupied beds on the day that weekly data were reported) (week of July 26). By mid-September, rates had declined to 6.3 per 1,000 resident-weeks (week of September 13) before increasing again, reaching 23.2 cases per 1,000 resident-weeks by late November (week of November 22). COVID-19 cases among nursing home staff members also increased during June and July (week of July 26 = 10.9 cases per 1,000 resident-weeks) before declining during August-September (week of September 13 = 6.3 per 1,000 resident-weeks); rates increased by late November (week of November 22 = 21.3 cases per 1,000 resident-weeks). Rates of COVID-19 in the surrounding communities followed similar trends. Increases in community rates might be associated with increases in nursing home COVID-19 incidence, and nursing home mitigation strategies need to include a comprehensive plan to monitor local SARS-CoV-2 transmission and minimize high-risk exposures within facilities.","Bagchi, Suparna; Mak, Josephine; Li, Qunna; Sheriff, Edward; Mungai, Elisabeth; Anttila, Angela; Soe, Minn Minn; Edwards, Jonathan R; Benin, Andrea L; Pollock, Daniel A; Shulman, Evan; Ling, Shari; Moody-Williams, Jean; Fleisher, Lee A; Srinivasan, Arjun; Bell, Jeneita M",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,565,16

Odorant receptors (ORs) expressed in the olfactory sensory neurons are known to be responsible for the interaction of mosquito vectors with human odors. To gain deeper insights into Ae. aegypti's olfactory physiology and investigate their interactions with humans at the molecular level, we used an optimized protocol of Xenopus Oocytes heterologous expression to functionally analyze Ae. aegypti odorant receptors in response to human odors. Three example experiments are presented: 1) Cloning and synthesizing cRNAs of ORs and odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco) from four to six days old Ae. aegypti antennae; 2) Microinjection and expression of ORs and Orco in Xenopus oocytes; and 3) Whole-cell current recording from Xenopus oocytes expressing mosquito ORs/Orco with a two-electrode voltage-clamp.

From 2013 to 2017, the U.S. Geological Survey completed multi-stressor/multi-assemblage stream ecological assessments in five regions of the United States (434 streams total). Diatom, invertebrate, and fish communities were enumerated, and five types of potential stressors were quantified: habitat disturbance, excess nutrients, high flows, basic water quality, and contaminants in water and sediment. Boosted regression tree (BRT) models for each biological assemblage and region generally included variables from all five stressor types and multiple stressors types in each model was the norm. Classification and regression tree (CART) models then were used to determine thresholds for each BRT model variable above which there appeared to be adverse effects (multi-metric index (MMI) models only). In every region and assemblage there was a significant inverse relation between the MMI and the number of stressors exerting potentially adverse effects. The number of elevated instream stressors often varied substantially for a given level of land-use development and the number of elevated stressors was a better predictor of biological condition than was development.

METHODS: We conducted a multi-center retrospective study involving all adults with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU between March and May 2020. Patients were divided into normoglycemic (average blood glucose < 140 mg/dL) and hyperglycemic (average blood glucose > 140 mg/dL) groups. Outcomes such as mortality, need and duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital and ICU stays were measured. RESULTS: Among 495 patients, 58.4% were male with a median age of 68 years (IQR: 58.00-77.00), and baseline average blood glucose was 186.6 (SD+130.8). Pre-existing diabetes was present in 35.8% of the studied cohort. Combined ICU and hospital mortality rates were 23.8%; mortality rate and mechanical ventilation were significantly higher in the hyperglycemic group (31.4 % vs. 16.6%, p=0.001) and (50.0% vs. 37.2%, p=0.004) respectively. Age above 60 years (HR:3.21 [95% CI 1.78, 5.78]) and hyperglycemia (HR:1.79 [95% CI 1.14, 2.82]) were the only significant predictors of in-hospital mortality. Increased risk for hyperglycemia was found in patients with steroids use (OR:1.521 [95% CI 1.054, 2.194]), triglycerides > 150 mg/dL (OR:1.62 [95% CI 1.109, 2.379]), and African-American race (OR:0.79 [95% CI 0.65, 0.95]). CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients is significantly associated with prolonged ICU length of stay, higher need of mechanical ventilation, and increased risk of mortality in the critical care setting. Tighter blood glucose control (<140 mg/dL) might improve outcomes in COVID-19 critically-ill patients, evidence from ongoing clinical trials is needed. This article is protected by copyright.

The relations between these three concepts are explored within this bleak time that has exposed previously neglected dynamics present in migrant communities living in distant host countries in Asia, Europe, and the United States of America. In this paper, we discuss the intricacies within religion and gender among migrant communities and the gendered impacts that COVID-19 has had on the aforementioned migrant communities. Through a secondary desk review analysis of the diverse emerging literature, we show that there are gendered implications of the pandemic measures taken by governments as migrant communities occupy unique translocalities. Overall, the intersection of religion, gender, and migration underscores religion reproducing gender roles among the migrants. The reproduction of gender in religious institutions disadvantage women amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis confirmed the trivial fact that migrant women continue to suffer disproportionately due to increased unemployment and disease burden coupled with religious practices that continue to advance the upward mobility of male migrants. There is a need to recast the place of migrant women in this era, and lastly, religion plays a renewed role among migrant communities especially for women who have enhanced their social positions and organizational skills through it. © 2021 by the authors.

However, allocating the COVID-19 vaccine globally poses a novel challenge of redistribution, one that cannot be effectively undertaken using current mechanisms for the dispensation of aid. An examination of the origins and implicit logic of global public goods theory shows that it would not be effective as a framework in this context. I argue that while it is a useful rhetorical tool to underscore the need for global access, it fails to account for concerns arising out of structural inequities between countries in the Global South and North. In addition to being ill-defined, the phrase encodes a neoliberal logic - one that prioritises the protection of private capital over democratic claims of redistribution and social justice. To ensure global access, our attention must be focussed instead on explicitly accounting for inequities, securing access for countries in the Global South and addressing the norm-setting powers of pharmaceutical companies.","Saksena, Nivedita",Glob Public Health,565,5

Like other financial markets worldwide, Africa’s have been characterised by increased volatility during the pandemic. The markets appear to respond to the external shocks caused by the health crisis, and Google search volume activity related to the COVID-19 virus, which is treated here as a proxy for panic and fear, is associated with an increase in market volatility of around 7%. For health data, only increases in confirmed cases appear to impact the stability of African markets, and the relatively low fatality rate has had no influence on market dynamics. However, Political responses are associated with a drop in volatility, while the fear of global financial markets exacerbates it.

Building on the SIRD model of disease transmission, I show that FE models tend to be misspecified for three reasons. First, despite misleading common trends in the pre-treatment period, the parallel trends assumption generally does not hold. Second, heterogeneity in infection rates and infected populations across regions cannot be accounted for by region-specific fixed effects, nor by conditioning on observable time-varying confounders. Third, epidemiological theory predicts heterogeneous treatment effects across regions and over time. Via simulations, I find that the bias resulting from model misspecification can be substantial, in magnitude and sometimes in sign. Overall, my results caution against the use of FE models for mitigation policy evaluation.","Gauthier, Germain",,565,20

A major virulence factor during its infection is the enzyme phospholipase C encoded by the plc gene, known as Clostridium perfringens phospholipase C (CpPLC). The present study was designed to understand the role of CpPLC in inducing survival mechanisms and mitochondrial-induced epigenetic changes in a human lymphocyte cell culture model. Following exposure to CpPLC, a significant generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species was observed, which coincided with the changes in the expression of vital components of MAP/ERK/RTK signaling cascade that regulates the downstream cellular functions. These disturbances further led to alterations in the mitochondrial genome and functioning. This was supported by the observed upregulation in the expression of mitochondrial fission genes Drp1, Fis1, and Mff, and mitochondrial fusion genes MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1 following CpPLC exposure. CpPLC exposed cells showed upregulation of OMA1, DELE1, and HRI genes involved in the integrated stress response (ISR), which suggests that it may induce the ISR that provides a pro-survival mechanism to the host cell. CpPLC also initiated immune patho-physiologic mechanisms including mitochondrial-induced epigenetic modifications through a mitochondrial-ROS driven signaling pathway. Interestingly, epigenetic machinery not only play a pivotal role in lymphocyte homeostasis by contributing to cell-fate decisions but thought to be one of the mechanisms by which intracellular pathogens survive within the host cells. Importantly, the impairment of mtDNA repair among the CpPLC exposed cells, induced alterations within mtDNA methylation, and led to the deregulation of MT-CO1, MT-ND6, MT-ATPase 6, and MT-ATPase8 gene expression profiles that are important for mitochondrial bioenergetics and subsequent metabolic pathways. This was further confirmed by the changes in the activity of mitochondrial electron chain complexes (complex I, II, III, IV and V). The altered mtDNA methylation profile was also found to be closely associated with the varied expression of mitomiRs and their targets. CpPLC exposed cells showed up-regulation of miR24 expression and down-regulation of miR34a, miR150, and miR155, while the increased expression of mitomiR target genes i.e. of K-Ras, MYC, EGFR, and NF-kß was also observed in these cells. Altogether, our findings provide novel insights into the derailment of redox signaling machinery in CpPLC treated lymphocytes and its role in the induction of survival mechanisms and mitochondrial-induced epigenetic modifications.","Bunkar, Neha; Sharma, Jahnavi; Chouksey, Anju; Kumari, Roshani; Gupta, Pushpendra Kumar; Tiwari, Rajnarayan; Lodhi, Lalit; Srivastava, Rupesh Kumar; Bhargava, Arpit; Mishra, Pradyumna Kumar",Cell Signal,565,24

These differences raise the question whether nations with lower incidence share any medical commonalities that could be used to not only explain that lower incidence, but that could also provide guidance for potential treatments elsewhere. Such treatment would be particularly valuable if it could be used as a prophylactic against COVID-19 transmission, thereby effectively slowing spread of the disease while we await the wide availability of safe and effective vaccines. Here, we show that countries with routine mass drug administration of prophylactic chemotherapy including Ivermectin have significantly lower incidences of COVID-19. Prophylactic use of Ivermectin against parasitic infections is most common in Africa and we hence show that the reported correlation is highly significant both when compared among African nations as well as in a worldwide context. We surmise that this may be connected to Ivermectin's ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication which likely leads to lower infection rates. However, other pathways must exist to explain persistence of such inhibitory effect after serum levels of Ivermectin have declined. It is suggested that Ivermectin be evaluated for potential off-label prophylactic use in certain cases to help bridge the time until a safe and effective vaccine becomes available.","Hellwig, Martin D; Maia, Anabela",Int J Antimicrob Agents,565,1

Given that young people are disproportionately disadvantaged by mental illness and will face further challenges from COVID-19, it is crucial that the appropriate mental health care be delivered to them as early as possible. Integrating digital health solutions into mental health service delivery pathways has the potential to greatly increase efficiencies, allowing for the provision of 'right care, first time'. We propose an innovative digital health solution for demand management intended for use by primary youth mental health services, comprised of: 1) a youth mental health model of care (i.e. BMC Youth Model); and 2) a health information technology specifically designed to deliver this model of care (e.g. the InnoWell Platform), as well as an operational protocol of how this solution could be applied to primary youth mental health service delivery processes. By 'flipping' conventional service delivery models of majority in-clinic and minority online-delivered care to a model where online-delivered care is the default, this digital health solution offers a scalable way of delivering quality youth mental health care, both in response to public health crises (such as COVID-19) and ongoingly into the future.","Davenport, Tracey A; Cheng, Vanessa Wan Sze; Iorfino, Frank; Hamilton, Blake; Castaldi, Eva; Burton, Amy; Scott, Elizabeth M; Hickie, Ian B",,565,16

As most of the countries relying on different preventive actions to control the outcomes of COVID-19, it is necessary to boost the knowledge about the effectiveness of such actions so that the policymakers take their country-based appropriate actions. This study generates evidence of taking the most impactful actions to combat COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: In order to generate community-based scientific evidence, this study analyzed the outcome of COVID-19 in response to different control measures, healthcare facilities, life expectancy, and prevalent diseases. METHODS: It used more than a hundred countries' data collected from different databases. We performed a comparative graphical analysis with non-linear correlation estimation using R. RESULTS: The reduction of COVID-19 cases is strongly correlated with the earliness of preventive initiation. The apathy of taking nationwide immediate precaution measures has been identified as one of the critical reasons to make the circumstances worse. There is significant non-linear relationship between COVID-19 case fatality and number of physicians (NCC = 0.22; p-value &#8804; 0.001), nurses and midwives (NCC = 0.17; p-value &#8804; 0.001), hospital beds (NCC = 0.20; p-value &#8804; 0.001), life expectancy of both sexes (NCC = 0.22; p-value &#8804; 0.001), life expectancy of female (NCC = 0.27; p-value &#8804; 0.001), and life expectancy of male (NCC = 0.19; p-value &#8804; 0.001). COVID-19 deaths were found to be reduced with increased medical personnel and hospital beds. Interestingly, no association between the comorbidities and severity of COVID-19 was found excluding asthma, cancer, Alzheimer's, and smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing healthcare facilities and early imposing the control measures could be valuable to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic. No association between COVID-19 and other comorbidities warranted further investigation at the pathobiological level.","Abdulla, Faruq; Nain, Zulkar; Karimuzzaman, Md; Hossain, Md Moyazzem; Rahman, Azizur",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),565,16

(2) Methods: Participants were recruited using Twitter® as a dissemination tool to reach as many respondents as possible in different parts of the Spanish territory. The participants were recruited in a cross-sectional study, which included answering an online questionnaire. Data were collected from 10 September through 23 November 2020. Respondents answered questions asking whether they intended to be vaccinated and provided the main reason for their answers. To estimate associations between vaccination hesitancy and independent variables, we fit Poisson regression models with robust variance. (3) Results: One thousand and two responses were obtained, of which only 731 were validated. One hundred and sixty-four participants stated that they would not be vaccinated (22.43%), of which 20-24% were non-health workers or unemployed, 17.5% physicians, 31.5% other health workers, and almost 35% nurses. Concerns about lack of effectiveness of the vaccination, lack of safety when vaccinating and possibly dangerous adverse effects were the main causes provided. (4) Conclusions: This study indicates that more interventions are needed to achieve better communication with the population and health professionals.

Starting from the Wuhan city in China, COVID-19 has conquered the entire world with its rapid progression. But seeking the importance towards the human situation, it has become essential to build such an automated model to diagnose COVID-19 within less computational time easily. As the disease has spread, there is not enough data to implement an accurate COVID-19 predicting model. But technology is a boon, which makes it possible. Effective techniques based on medical imaging using artificial intelligence have approached to assist humans in needful time. It has become very essential to detect COVID-19 in humans at an early stage to prevent it from becoming more infectious. The neural networks have shown promising results in medical imaging. In this research, a deep learning-based approach is used for image classification to detect COVID-19 using chest X-ray images (CXR). A CNN classifier have been used to classify the normal-healthy images from the COVID-19 images, using transfer learning. The concept of early stopping is used to enhance the accuracy of the proposed DenseNet model. The results of the system have been evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score metrics. An automated comparative analysis among multiple optimizers, LR Scheduler and Loss Function is performed to get the highest accuracy suitable for the proposed system. The Adamax optimizer with Cross Entropy loss function and StepLR scheduler have outperformed with 98.45% accuracy for normal-healthy CXR images and 98.32% accuracy for COVID-19 images.","Chauhan, Tavishee Palivela Hemant Tiwari Sarveshmani",International Journal of Information Management Data Insights,565,29

We investigated the seroprevalence among HCW in Massachusetts (a region suffering high COVID-19 mortality) at the end of first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. All HCW at Cambridge Health Alliance were invited to participate in this cross-sectional survey in June 2020. Those who volunteered, consented and provided a blood sample were included. Dried blood specimens from finger-prick sampling collected either at home by each HCW or onsite by the study team were analyzed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG to the virus' receptor binding domain, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IgM and IgG antibody abundance were categorized based on the number of standard deviations above the cross-reacting levels found in existing, pre-pandemic blood samples previously obtained by the Ragon Institute and analyzed by the Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA). Seroprevalence estimates were made based on 'positive' IgM or IgG using 'low' (>6 SD), 'medium' (>4.5 SD), and 'high' prevalence cutoffs (>3 SD).A total of 433 out of 5,204 eligible HCWs consented and provided samples. Participating HCWs had a lower cumulative incidence (from the start of the pandemic up to the bloodspot collections) of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity (1.85%) compared to non-participants (3.29%).

Several methods have been proposed but little is known of their performance. This paper fills the gap with a comparative evaluation of eleven methods and an updated one based on the GUIDE algorithm. For data without missing values, eight of the methods are shown to be biased in that they give higher or lower scores to different types of variables, even when all are independent of the response. Of the remaining four methods, only two are applicable to data with missing values, with GUIDE the only unbiased one. GUIDE achieves unbiasedness by using a self-calibrating step that is applicable to other methods for score de-biasing. GUIDE also yields a threshold for distinguishing important from unimportant variables at 95 and 99 percent confidence levels; the technique is applicable to other methods as well. Finally, the paper studies the relationship of the scores to predictive power in three data sets. It is found that the scores of many methods are more consistent with marginal predictive power than conditional predictive power.","Loh, Wei-Yin; Zhou, Peigen",,565,16

We addressed this gap by conducting an online survey of members of IPV and sexual assault workforce using a broad, web-based recruitment strategy. In total, 352 staff from 24 states participated. We collaborated with practitioner networks and anti-violence coalitions to develop the brief survey, which included questions about work and health, safety planning, and stress. We used chi-square, t-test, and ANOVA analysis techniques to analyze differences within position and demographic variables. For qualitative data, we used thematic analysis to analyze responses from four open-ended questions. The sample was majority female-identified (93.7%) and essential workers in dual IPV and sexual assault programs (80.7%). Findings demonstrated that since the pandemic began, IPV and sexual assault staff are experiencing more personal and professional stressors, perceive a decrease in client safety, and lack resources needed to help survivors and themselves. Common problems included a lack of food or supplies at home and work and housing and financial support for survivors. There was a 51% increase in the use of video conference for work, which contributed to workforce strain. Reductions in overall service capacity and a shift to remote service provision have implications for both survivors and staff. These findings suggest a critical need for additional training, infrastructure, and support for the IPV and sexual assault workforce. There is an urgent need to classify IPV and sexual assault staff as first responders and address the occupational stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wood, Leila; Schrag, Rachel Voth; Baumler, Elizabeth; Hairston, Dixie; Guillot-Wright, Shannon; Torres, Elizabeth; Temple, Jeff R",J Interpers Violence,565,20

The incidence of AKI in patients with CoVID-19 is variable across numerous international studies, but the high incidence of AKI and its associated worse outcomes in the critical care setting are a consistent finding. A multitude of patterns and mechanisms of AKI have been elucidated, and novel strategies to address shortage of renal replacement therapy equipment have been implemented. The disease also has had consequences on longitudinal management of patients with chronic kidney disease and end stage kidney disease. Kidney transplant recipients may be especially susceptible to CoVID-19 as a result of immunosuppression, with preliminary studies demonstrating high mortality rates.

SARS-CoV-2 enters into and infects host cells through its spike glycoprotein recognizing the cell receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Here, we noticed that ACE2 was further enhanced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human germ cells and early embryos express high level of ACE2. Notably, RNA-seq result showed that reduction of H3K27me3, but not H3K4/9/36me3, led to upregulation of Ace2 expression in mouse germ cell line GC-2. In agreement with this result, we found in human embryonic stem cells that ACE2 expression was significantly increased in absence of EZH2, the major enzyme catalyzing H3K27me3. ChIP-seq analysis further confirmed decrease of H3K27me3 signal and increase of H3K27ac signal at ACE2 promoter upon EZH2 knockout. Therefore, we propose that EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 at ACE2 promoter region inhibits ACE2 expression in mammalian cells. This regulatory pattern may also exist in other human cells and tissues. Our discovery provides clues for pathogenesis and targeted drug therapy towards ACE2 expression for prevention and adjuvant therapy of COVID-19.","Li, Yuanyuan; Li, Honggang; Zhou, Liquan",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,565,5

This study describes self-reported changes in registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) practice related to delivery of nutrition care via telehealth shortly after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. This cross-sectional, anonymous online survey was administered from mid-April to mid-May 2020 to RDNs in the United States providing face-to-face nutrition care prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This survey included 54 questions about practitioner demographics and experience and current practices providing nutrition care via telehealth, including billing procedures, and was completed by 2016 RDNs with a median (interquartile range) of 15 (6-27) years of experience in dietetics practice. Although 37% of respondents reported that they provided nutrition care via telehealth prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, this proportion was 78% at the time of the survey. Respondents reported spending a median (interquartile range) of 30 (20-45) minutes in direct contact with the individual/group per telehealth session. The most frequently reported barriers to delivering nutrition care via telehealth were lack of client interest (29%) and Internet access (26%) and inability to conduct or evaluate typical nutrition assessment or monitoring/evaluation activities (28%). Frequently reported benefits included promoting compliance with social distancing (66%) and scheduling flexibility (50%). About half of RDNs or their employers sometimes or always bill for telehealth services, and of those, 61% are sometimes or always reimbursed. Based on RDN needs, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics continues to advocate and provide resources for providing effective telehealth and receiving reimbursement via appropriate coding and billing. Moving forward, it will be important for RDNs to participate fully in health care delivered by telehealth and telehealth research both during and after the COVID-19 public health emergency.","Rozga, Mary; Handu, Deepa; Kelley, Kathryn; Jimenez, Elizabeth Yakes; Martin, Hannah; Schofield, Marsha; Steiber, Alison",Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,565,16

The goal of our study was to test whether pandemic-related stress was associated with food intake, and whether relationships between stress and intake were modified by appetitive and cognitive traits. (2) Methods: We cross-sectionally surveyed 428 adults to examine current intake frequency of various food types (sweets/desserts, savory snacks, fast food, fruits, and vegetables), changes to food intake during the pandemic, emotional overeating (EOE), cognitive flexibility (CF), and COVID-19-related stress. Models tested associations of stress, EOE, and CF with food intake frequency and changes to intake. (3) Results: Models demonstrated that the positive relationship between stress and intake of sweets/desserts was stronger with higher EOE, while the positive relationship between stress and intake of chips/savory snacks was weaker with higher CF. Higher EOE was associated with greater risk of increased intake of palatable foods. (4) Conclusions: Findings suggest that emotional overeating may escalate stress-associated intake of high-sugar foods, and cognitive flexibility may attenuate stress-associated intake of high-fat foods. Differences in appetitive and cognitive traits may explain changes to and variability in food intake during COVID-19, and efforts to decrease emotional overeating and encourage cognitive flexibility could help lessen the effect of COVID-19-related stress on energy dense food intake.","Sadler, Jennifer R; Thapaliya, Gita; Jansen, Elena; Aghababian, Anahys H; Smith, Kimberly R; Carnell, Susan",Nutrients,565,1

There are currently no antiviral drugs available with proven efficacy or vaccines for its prevention. An understanding of the underlying cellular mechanisms involved in virus replication is essential for repurposing the existing drugs and/or the discovery of new ones. Endocytosis is the important mechanism of entry of CoVs into host cells. Endosomal maturation followed by the fusion with lysosomes are crucial events in endocytosis. Late endosomes and lysosomes are characterized by their acidic pH, which is generated by a proton transporter V-ATPase and required for virus entry via endocytic pathway. The cytoplasmic cAMP pool produced by soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) promotes V-ATPase recruitment to endosomes/lysosomes and thus their acidification. In this review, we discuss targeting the sAC-specific cAMP pool as a potential strategy to impair the endocytic entry of the SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell. Furthermore, we consider the potential impact of sAC inhibition on CoV-induced disease via modulation of autophagy and apoptosis.","Aslam, Muhammad; Ladilov, Yury",,565,20

A first “school of thought” advocates that what matters are only standard epidemiological variables (i.e. frequency of interactions in proportion of the viral charge). A second school of thought argues that co-factors such as quality of air play an important role too. METHODS: We analyzed available literature concerning the link between air quality, as measured by different pollutants and a number of COVID-19 outcomes, such as number of positive cases, deaths, and excess mortality rates. We reviewed several studies conducted worldwide and discussing many different methodological approaches aimed at investigating causality associations. RESULTS: Our paper reviewed the most recent empirical researches documenting the existence of a huge evidence produced worldwide concerning the role played by air pollution on health in general and on COVID-19 outcomes in particular. These results support both research hypotheses, i.e. long-term exposure effects and short-term consequences (including the hypothesis of particulate matter acting as viral “carrier”) according to the two schools of thought, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The link between air pollution and COVID-19 outcomes is strong and robust as resulting from many different research methodologies. Policy implications should be drawn from a “rational” assessment of these findings as “not taking any action” represents an action itself.","Becchetti, Leonardo; Beccari, Gabriele; Conzo, Gianluigi; Conzo, Pierluigi; De Santis, Davide; Salustri, Francesco",Environ Res,565,9

The lifetime imaging method of PSP does not theoretically require wind-off reference images. Therefore, it can improve measurement accuracy because it can eliminate errors caused by the deformation or movement of the model during the measurement. However, it is reported that the luminescence lifetime of PSP is not uniform on the model, even under uniform conditions of pressure and temperature. Therefore, reference images are used to compensate for the nonuniformity of the luminescence lifetime, which significantly diminishes the advantages of the lifetime imaging method. In particular, fast-responding PSPs show considerable variation in luminescence lifetime compared to conventional polymer-based PSPs. Therefore, this study investigated and discussed the factors causing the nonuniformity of the luminescence lifetime, such as the luminophore solvent, luminophore concentrations, binder thickness, and spraying conditions. The results obtained suggest that the nonuniformity of the luminophore distribution in the binder caused by the various factors mentioned above during the coating process is closely related to the nonuniformity of the luminescence lifetime. For example, when the thickness of the binder became thinner than 8 µm, the fast-responding PSPs showed a tendency to vary significantly in the luminescence lifetime. In addition, it was found that the luminescence lifetime of fast-responding PSP could be changed in the depth direction of the binder depending on the coating conditions. Therefore, it is important to distribute the luminophore uniformly in the binder layer to create PSPs with a more uniform luminescence lifetime distribution.","Egami, Yasuhiro; Yamazaki, Yuya; Hori, Naoto; Sugioka, Yosuke; Nakakita, Kazuyuki",Sensors (Basel),565,16

In several purchased in‐house primers/probe sets, quantification cycle values as low as 17 were measured for negative control samples. However, there were also primers/probe sets that displayed very low‐level contaminations, which were detected only during thorough internal validation. Hence, it appears imperative to pre‐test each batch of reagents extensively before use in routine diagnosis, to avoid false‐positive results and low positive predictive value in low‐prevalence situations.

We demonstrate using genomic epidemiology that the hospital outbreak (n=23) was linked to a concurrent outbreak at a local aged care facility, but was phylogenetically distinct from other community clusters. Thirty day survival was 50% for hospitalised patients (an elderly cohort with significant comorbidities) and 100% for staff. Staff who acquired infection were unable to attend work for a median of 26.5 days (range 14-191); an additional 140 staff were furloughed for quarantine. Transmission from index cases showed a wide dispersion (mean 3.5 persons infected for every patient case and 0.6 persons infected for every staff case). One patient, who received regular nebulised medication prior to their diagnosis being known, acted as an apparent superspreader. No secondary transmissions occurred from isolated cases or contacts who were quarantined prior to becoming infectious. This analysis elaborates the wide-ranging impacts on patients and staff of nosocomial COVID-19 transmission and highlights the utility of genomic analysis as an adjunct to traditional epidemiological investigations. Delayed case recognition resulted in nosocomial transmission but once recognised, prompt action by the outbreak management team and isolation with contact and droplet (without airborne) precautions were sufficient to prevent transmission within this cohort.

Topical application of IMQ to back skin caused significant changes in the composition of microbiota in the intestine and skin of IMQ-treated mice compared to control mice. The LEfSe algorithm identified the species Staphylococcus lentus as potential skin microbial marker for IMQ group. Furthermore, there were correlations for several microbes between the intestine and skin, suggesting a role of skin–gut–microbiota in IMQ-treated mice. Levels of succinic acid and lactic acid in feces from IMQ-treated mice were significantly higher than control mice. Moreover, the predictive functional analysis of the microbiota in the intestine and skin showed that IMQ caused alterations in several KEGG pathways.

The slow and inefficient process of carrying out traditional randomized clinical trials led regulatory authorities to hastily approve treatments and tests without sufficient evidence of safety and efficacy. We here outline issues with the current research platform, summarize shortcomings of traditional randomized clinical trials particularly apparent at the time of pandemics, and highlight the advantages of pragmatic clinical trials as an alternative to rapidly generate the needed clinical evidence. We further discuss barriers and challenges to pragmatic clinical trials implementation and explore opportunities for research institutions and regulatory authorities to facilitate widespread adoption of this vital research tool. As a subsequent wave of COVID-19, and/or another epidemic, are all but inevitable in our lifetime, we must ensure that our research infrastructure is conducive to carrying out pragmatic clinical trials to expeditiously generate the needed evidence and blunt the epidemic’s toll on human lives and livelihoods.","Almufleh, Aws; Joseph, Jacob",Trials,565,16

While early life stress (ELS) increases susceptibility to psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder (MDD), acute stress during adulthood can also precipitate MDD after ELS. AIM: Here, we tested the expression of miRNAs following ELS and susceptibility to depression-like behavior and whether sex or acute stress exacerbates this response. We also tested whether environmental enrichment (Enr) promotes early life and adult behavioral stress resilience and its effect on hypothalamic miRNA and gene expression. Following rat maternal separation (MS) as an ELS model, Enr from weaning through adulthood, and restraint (RS) as acute adult stress, we tested both animal behavior and miRNA expression in the hypothalamus. Target genes and their enrichment and ontology were analyzed using bioinformatic tools. Target gene expression changes were tested using qPCR, and miRNA promoter methylation was studied using methylated-DNA immunoprecipitation qPCR. RESULTS: MS, Enr, RS, and sex altered hypothalamic miRNAs, including several previously reported in MS literature: miRs-29, - 124, - 132, - 144, - 504. Sex had a significant effect on the greatest number of miRNAs. Also, Enr reversed downregulation of miR-29b-1-5p and -301b-3p in MS. qPCR showed that MAPK6 and MMP19, targets of miR-301b-3p, were upregulated in MS and reversed by Enr. Additionally, miR-219a was hypermethylated in MS coinciding with decreased miR-219a expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that sex plays a critical role in the hypothalamic miRNA response to both ELS and acute stress, with males expressing greater changes following postnatal stress. Moreover, enrichment significantly altered behavior as well as hypothalamic miRNA expression and their gene targets. Because of its role as the initiator of the autonomic stress response and connection to hedonic and motivational behavior, the hypothalamic miRNA landscape may significantly alter both the short and long-term behavioral response to stress.","McKibben, Lauren Allen; Dwivedi, Yogesh",BMC Genomics,565,1

In order to explore the leukopenia mechanism, we studied 15 SARS patients who were previously healthy, and 15 age-matched normal controls in a paired design. Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) in plasma were measured by ELISA, and intracellular activated caspase-3 fragment in different leukocytes was determined by flow cytometry. Patients with SARS had significantly lower lymphocyte and platelet counts and significantly higher sVCAM-1 and sFasL levels compared to healthy controls. sVCAM-1 levels correlated negatively with total leukocytes and platelet counts, but positively with plasma sFasL levels. Intracellular cleaved caspase-3 expression was also significantly higher in lymphocytes from SARS patients in acute phase than in convalescent stage. Lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia in SARS patients may be caused, in part, by enhanced vascular sequestration associated with increased sVCAM-1 levels. However, lymphopenia may be due to enhanced cell death. Inhibition of cell adhesion and caspase-3 activation could, therefore, have prevented SARS patients from developing thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia.","Chen, Rong-Fu; Chang, Jen-Chieh; Yeh, Wen-Tien; Lee, Chen-Hsiang; Liu, Jien-Wei; Eng, Hock-Liew; Yang, Kuender D.",Microbes Infect,565,13

All ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Few studies had reported milder course in children however, severe course of illness has been reported. We aimed to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 in pediatric patients including diagnostic findings and therapeutic interventions in sever disease manifestation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 742 patients with SARS-CoV-2 proven infection at King Abdullah Specialist Children’s Hospital, from April 2020 and July 2020. Inpatients, outpatient, including those with sever manifestation treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were included. We collected data including demographic data, comorbidities, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Among of 742 patients, 71 (9.6%) were hospitalized. The median age of patients was 75 months old and 53.6 were male. A total of 461 (62.1%) had close contact with confirmed cases, 45 (6.1%) had no contact history, and 236 (31.8%) with unknown exposure risk. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (32.5%), respiratory symptoms (21%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (10.3%). Among the entire cohort, 7 patients were admitted to PICU with COVID-19 related symptoms, five patients diagnosed with MIS-C, one patient with Kawasaki, and one patient with pneumonia. All patients received supportive therapy, no antiviral treatment had been used however, in MIS-C patients IVIG had been given to all patients, five patients received Anakinra; and one patient received tocilizumab. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are less likely to develop symptomatic or serious diseases. Among symptomatic children, the most common clinical features were fever and respiratory symptoms followed by gastrointestinal manifestations. The majority of infected children have reported contact with an infected individual. MIS-C associated with COVID-19 is a severe presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection and of a major concern as an overlapping features with other diseases could happen, making the diagnosis challenging.","Alharbi, Musaed; Kazzaz, Yasser M.; Hameed, Tahir; Alqanatish, Jubran; Alkhalaf, Hamad; Alsadoon, Alaa; Alayed, Maria; Hussien, Shahad Abu; Shaalan, Mohammed Al; Al Johani, Sameera M.",J Infect Public Health,565,22

HMGB1 gradually increased in the alveolar fluid after the onset of acute exacerbation, in positive correlation with monocytes chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), a potent fibrogenic mediator. In the lung tissues of eight IPF patients autopsied after acute exacerbation, intense cytoplasmic staining for HMGB1 was observed in the alveolar epithelial cells in alveolar capillary augmented lesions, where the capillary endothelial cells remarkably reduced the expression of thrombomodulin, an intrinsic antagonist of HMGB1. These results suggest pathogenic roles for HMGB1 and MCP-1 in the late phase of acute exacerbation of IPF.","Ebina, Masahito; Taniguchi, Hiroyuki; Miyasho, Taku; Yamada, Shingo; Shibata, Naoko; Ohta, Hiromitsu; Hisata, Shu; Ohkouchi, Shinya; Tamada, Tsutomu; Nishimura, Hidekazu; Ishizaka, Akitoshi; Maruyama, Ikuro; Okada, Yoshinori; Takashi, Kondo; Nukiwa, Toshihiro",Pulm Med,565,15

Military healthcare workers in China have experienced many pressures when combating COVID‐19. This study aimed to investigate the current psychological status and associated risk factors among military healthcare workers. METHODS: We collected data from 194 military healthcare workers from three inpatient wards in two specialized COVID‐19 hospitals using a web‐based cross‐sectional survey. The survey covered demographic information, the patient health questionnaire‐9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder‐7, and the patient health questionnaire‐15. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to explore potential risk factors for mental health problems. RESULTS: The overall prevalence rates of depressive, generalized anxiety, and somatic symptoms were 37.6%, 32.5%, and 50%, respectively. Rates of severe depression, generalized anxiety, and somatic symptoms were 5.2%, 3.6%, and 15.5%, respectively. In 22.7% of cases, comorbidities existed between depression, generalized anxiety, and somatization. A junior‐grade professional title was associated with depression, older age was associated with generalized anxiety and somatization, and short sleep duration and poor sleep quality were associated with all three symptoms. DISCUSSION: The prevalence of depression, generalized anxiety, and somatic symptoms among military healthcare workers in specialized COVID‐19 hospitals is high during the current COVID‐19 outbreak. A junior‐grade professional title, older age, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality significantly affect military healthcare workers' mental health. Continuous surveillance and monitoring of the psychological consequences of the COVID‐19 outbreak should be routine to promote mental health among military healthcare workers.","Pan, Xiao; Xiao, Ying; Ren, Ding; Xu, Zheng‐Mei; Zhang, Qian; Yang, Li‐Ying; Liu, Fen; Hao, Yu‐Shi; Zhao, Feng; Bai, Yong‐Hai",Asia Pac Psychiatry,565,20

Long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals are vital in the care of CCI patients, but their role for patients post COVID-19 infection is not known. Barlow Respiratory Hospital (BRH) is a 105-bed, LTAC hospital network serving ventilator-dependent and medically-complex patients transferred from the ICUs of hospitals in southern California. We report patient characteristics of our first series of COVID-19 survivors admitted to the post-acute venue of an LTAC hospital. Methods: Single-center observational descriptive report of patients recovering from acute infectious complications of COVID-19 pneumonia requiring long-term respiratory support. Results: From 28 April to 7 September 2020, 41 patients were admitted to BRH for continued recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia. Median age: 68 [44-94] years, 25/41 (61%) male, 33/41 (80.5%) with tracheostomy, 21/41 (51.2%) on invasive mechanical ventilation, 9/41 (22%) receiving hemodialysis. All mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis interventions were initiated at the transferring hospital. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report to characterize CCI and medically complex COVID-19 patients transferred to the post-acute venue of an LTAC hospital. Patients on average spent over six weeks in the transferring hospital mostly in the ICU, are largely elderly, carry the known risk factors for COVID-19 infection, and experienced respiratory failure necessitating prolonged mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. Our findings suggest that these patients will continue to require considerable medical interventions and treatments, including weaning from mechanical ventilation, owing to the numerous sequelae of the infection and the burden of acute-on-chronic diseases. As ICU survival rates improve, this research further emphasizes the important role of the LTAC hospital in responding to the COVID-19 crisis.","Hassenpflug, Meg Stearn; Jun, Dale; Nelson, David R.; Dolinay, Tamas",F1000Res,565,17

There are now growing concerns that the risks associated with restricted access to family caregivers and visitors have started to outweigh the potential benefits associated with preventing COVID-19 infections. Many residents have sustained severe and potentially irreversible physical, functional, cognitive, and mental health declines. As Canada emerges from its first wave of the pandemic, nursing homes across the country have cautiously started to reopen these settings, yet there is broad criticism that emerging visitor policies are overly restrictive, inequitable and potentially harmful. We reviewed the nursing home visitor policies for Canada’s ten provinces and three territories as well as international policies and reports on the topic to develop evidence-informed, data-driven and expert-reviewed guidance for the re-opening of Canadian nursing homes to family caregivers and visitors.","Stall, Nathan M.; Johnstone, Jennie; McGeer, Allison J.; Dhuper, Misha; Dunning, Julie; Sinha, Samir K.",J Am Med Dir Assoc,565,1

During the outbreak of the emergent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection, >30% of the ∼8000 infected persons were health care workers. The highly infectious nature of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) compelled our pathologists to consider biosafety issues in the autopsy room and for tissue processing procedures. Methods. A specially designed biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) autopsy laboratory was constructed and divided into a clean area, a semicontaminated area, a contaminated area, and 2 buffer zones. High-efficiency particulate air filters were placed in the air supply and exhaust systems. Laminar air flow was from the clean areas to the less clean areas. The negative pressures of the contaminated, semicontaminated, and clean areas were approximately -50 pa, -25 pa, and -5 pa, respectively. Personal protective equipment, including gas mask, impermeable protective clothing, and 3 layers of gloves worn during autopsies; the equipment was decontaminated before it was allowed to exit the facility. Strict BSL-3 practices were followed. Results. When a given concentration of particulate sarin simulant was introduced into the contaminated area, it could not be detected in either the semicontaminated area or clean area, and particles >0.3 μm in size were not detected in the exhaust air. A total of 16 complete postmortem examinations for probable and suspected SARS were performed during a 2-month period. Of these, 7 reported confirmed cases of SARS. None of the 23 pathologists and technicians who participated in these autopsies was infected with SARS-CoV. Conclusions. Our experience suggests that BSL-3 laboratory operating principles should be among the special requirements for performing autopsies of contaminated bodies and that they can safeguard the clinicians and the environment involved in these procedures.","Li, Ling; Gu, Jiang; Shi, Xicheng; Gong, Encong; Li, Xingwang; Shao, Hongquan; Shi, Xueying; Jiang, Huijun; Gao, Xiaoqiang; Cheng, Daiyun; Guo, Lizhu; Wang, Hao; Shi, Xiaohong; Wang, Peizhi; Zhang, Qianying; Shen, Bing",Clin Infect Dis,565,16

However, the detailed mechanism underlying hepatocyte infection with HCV is not yet completely understood. We previously identified a novel C-type lectin—LSECtin predominantly expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Here we demonstrate that LSECtin can interact with two HCV receptors, DC-SIGNR and CD81, through its central ectodomain. Furthermore, cells expressing LSECtin specifically can be attached by the naturally occurring HCV in the sera of infected individuals. This binding was found to be mediated by the HCV E2 glycoprotein and could be efficiently inhibited by EGTA but not by mannan treatment. The present study suggests that LSECtin interaction with DC-SIGNR might contribute to HCV binding to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells.

Eighty percent of patients required respiratory assistance, half of them being on mechanical ventilation. Fiftyone percent had hepatic involvement and hyposmia was ascertained in 3 patients. Searching for common genes by collapsing methods against 150 WES of controls of the Italian population failed to give straightforward statistically significant results with the exception of two genes. This result is not unexpected since we are facing the most challenging common disorder triggered by environmental factors with a strong underlying heritability (50%). The lesson learned from Autism-Spectrum-Disorders prompted us to re-analyse the cohort treating each patient as an independent case, following a Mendelian-like model. We identified for each patient an average of 2.5 pathogenic mutations involved in virus infection susceptibility and pinpointing to one or more rare disorder(s). To our knowledge, this is the first report on WES and COVID-19. Our results suggest a combined model for COVID-19 susceptibility with a number of common susceptibility genes which represent the favorite background in which additional host private mutations may determine disease progression.","Benetti, Elisa; Giliberti, Annarita; Emiliozzi, Arianna; Valentino, Floriana; Bergantini, Laura; Fallerini, Chiara; Anedda, Federico; Amitrano, Sara; Conticini, Edoardo; Tita, Rossella; d’Alessandro, Miriana; Fava, Francesca; Marcantonio, Simona; Baldassarri, Margherita; Bruttini, Mirella; Mazzei, Maria Antonietta; Montagnani, Francesca; Mandalà, Marco; Bargagli, Elena; Furini, Simone; Renieri, Alessandra; Mari, Francesca",PLoS One,565,1

METHODS: A total of 266 healthcare workers working in a medical college in Nepal were studied using a questionnaire consisting of three sections: demographics, experiences and perception of COVID-19, and COVID-19 vaccine safety. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 26. The total perception score was calculated by noting respondent’s agreement with a set of eleven statements using a Likert-type scale. Non-parametric tests (Mann–Whitney U and Kruskal–Wallis) were used for analysis (p<0.05). RESULTS: Altogether, 13.9% of respondents had been diagnosed COVID-19 positive prior to the survey. Many considered themselves to be at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Only over one third (38.3%) were willing to be vaccinated. The most common reason for refusal/hesitancy was concern about vaccine safety. The median (interquartile range) total perception score was 36 (4) (maximum possible score=55). The score was significantly higher among those who had been diagnosed COVID positive, those who perceived the pandemic as being moderate or severe and among those willing to be vaccinated CONCLUSION: Addressing doubts related to vaccine safety and providing more data on the safety of vaccine may be helpful in overcoming hesitancy.","Paudel, Sabita; Palaian, Subish; Shankar, Pathiyil Ravi; Subedi, Nuwadatta",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,565,21

Methods Data was collected for 96 patients with neck of femur fractures who presented to the emergency department between March 1, 2020 and May 15, 2020. This data set included information about their COVID-19 status. Parameters including inpatient complications, hospital quality measures, mortality rates, and training opportunities were compared between the COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative groups. Furthermore, our current cohort of patients were compared against a historical control group of 95 patients who presented with neck of femur fractures before the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Seven (7.3%) patients were confirmed COVID positive by RT-PCR testing. The COVID positive cohort, when compared to the COVID negative cohort, had higher rates of postoperative complications (71.4% vs 25.9%), increased length of stay (30.3 days vs 12 days) and quicker time to surgery (0.7 days vs 1.3 days).The 2020 cohort compared to the 2019 cohort, had an increased 30-day mortality rate (13.5% vs 4.2%), increased number of delayed cases (25% vs 11.8%) as well as reduced training opportunities for Orthopaedic trainees to perform the surgery (51.6% vs 22.8%). Conclusion COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the care and outcome of neck of femur fracture patients during the pandemic with an increase in 30-day mortality rate. There were profound adverse effects on patient management pathways and outcomes while also affecting training opportunities.","Lim, Jiang An; Thahir, Azeem; Amar Korde, Vinayak; Krkovic, Matija",The archives of bone and joint surgery,565,16

Randomized clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines included few patients with kidney disease; therefore, vaccine immunogenicity is uncertain in this population. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis following 1 vs 2 doses of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination compared with health care workers serving as controls and convalescent serum. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective, single-center cohort study was conducted between February 2 and April 17, 2021, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Participants included 142 patients receiving in-center hemodialysis and 35 health care worker controls. EXPOSURES: BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies to the spike protein (anti-spike), receptor binding domain (anti-RBD), and nucleocapsid protein (anti-NP). RESULTS: Among the 142 participants undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, 94 (66%) were men; median age was 72 (interquartile range, 62-79) years. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were measured in 66 patients receiving 1 vaccine dose following a public health policy change, 76 patients receiving 2 vaccine doses, and 35 health care workers receiving 2 vaccine doses. Detectable anti-NP suggestive of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in 15 of 142 (11%) patients at baseline, and only 3 patients had prior COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. Two additional patients contracted COVID-19 after receiving 2 doses of vaccine. In 66 patients receiving a single BNT162b2 dose, seroconversion occurred in 53 (80%) for anti-spike and 36 (55%) for anti-RBD by 28 days postdose, but a robust response, defined by reaching the median levels of antibodies in convalescent serum from COVID-19 survivors, was noted in only 15 patients (23%) for anti-spike and 4 (6%) for anti-RBD in convalescent serum from COVID-19 survivors. In patients receiving 2 doses of BNT162b2 vaccine, seroconversion occurred in 69 of 72 (96%) for anti-spike and 63 of 72 (88%) for anti-RBD by 2 weeks following the second dose and median convalescent serum levels were reached in 52 of 72 patients (72%) for anti-spike and 43 of 72 (60%) for anti-RBD. In contrast, all 35 health care workers exceeded the median level of anti-spike and anti-RBD found in convalescent serum 2 to 4 weeks after the second dose. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests poor immunogenicity 28 days following a single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine in the hemodialysis population, supporting adherence to recommended vaccination schedules and avoiding delay of the second dose in these at-risk individuals.","Yau, Kevin; Abe, Kento T.; Naimark, David; Oliver, Matthew J.; Perl, Jeffrey; Leis, Jerome A.; Bolotin, Shelly; Tran, Vanessa; Mullin, Sarah I.; Shadowitz, Ellen; Gonzalez, Anny; Sukovic, Tatjana; Garnham-Takaoka, Julie; de Launay, Keelia Quinn; Takaoka, Alyson; Straus, Sharon E.; McGeer, Allison J.; Chan, Christopher T.; Colwill, Karen; Gingras, Anne-Claude; Hladunewich, Michelle A.",JAMA Netw Open,565,11

Despite global investment in HIV service delivery and the parallel challenge of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), there are few examples of integrated programs addressing both HIV and NCDs through differentiated service delivery. In 2014, the National Department of Health (NDoH) of South Africa launched the Central Chronic Medicines Dispensing and Distribution (CCMDD) program to provide patients who have chronic diseases, including HIV, with alternative access to medications via community-based pick-up points. This study describes the expansion of CCMDD toward national scale. METHODS: Yale monitors CCMDD expansion as part of its mixed methods evaluation of Project Last Mile, a national technical support partner for CCMDD since 2016. From March 2016 through October 2019, cumulative weekly data on CCMDD uptake [patients enrolled, facilities registered, pick-up points contracted], type of medication provided [ART only; NCD only; and ART-NCD] and collection sites preferred by patients [external pick-up points; adherence/outreach clubs; or facility-based fast lanes], were extracted for descriptive, longitudinal analysis. RESULTS: As of October 2019, 3,436 health facilities were registered with CCMDD across 46 health districts (88 % of South Africa’s districts), and 2,037 external pick-up points had been contracted by the NDoH. A total of 2,069,039 patients were actively serviced through CCMDD, a significant increase since 2018 (p < 0.001), including 76 % collecting ART [64 % ART only, 12 % ART plus NCD/comorbidities] and 479,120 [24 %] collecting medications for chronic diseases only. Further, 734,005 (35 %) of patients were collecting from contracted, external pick-up points, a 73 % increase in patient volume from 2018. DISCUSSION: This longitudinal description of CCMDD provides an example of growth of a national differentiated service delivery model that integrates management of HIV and noncommunicable diseases. This study demonstrates the success of the program in engaging patients irrespective of their chronic condition, which bodes well for the potential of the program to address the rising burden of both HIV and NCDs in South Africa. CONCLUSIONS: The CCMDD program expansion signals the potential for a differentiated service delivery strategy in resource-limited settings that can be agnostic of the patients chronic disease condition.","Liu, Lingrui; Christie, Sarah; Munsamy, Maggie; Roberts, Phil; Pillay, Merlin; Shenoi, Sheela V.; Desai, Mayur M.; Linnander, Erika L.",BMC Health Serv Res,565,16

However, the detailed mechanism underlying this effect and the factors involved in the regulation of ATF4 function are still unknown. Here, we demonstrate first that knocking out ATF4 using siRNA shows a strong negative effect on HIV-1 production, indicating that ATF4 is a functional positive cellular factor in HIV-1 production. To determine the mechanism by which ATF4 regulates the HIV-1 life cycle, we assessed the effect of the overexpression of wild type ATF4 and its various derivatives on HIV-1 LTR-mediated transcriptional activation and the production of HIV-1 particles. This effect was studied through co-transfection experiments with either reporter vectors or proviral DNA.

This study aims to evaluate the effect of time delay and post-ERCP complications on cholecystectomy outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients who underwent pre-op ERCP for concurrent cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis between January 2009 and August 2019 at University Hospitals Plymouth, UK, were included. Patients who underwent single-stage cholecystectomy and common bile duct exploration were excluded from the study. Based on the delay to cholecystectomy, the patients were divided into early (within 2 weeks), intermediate (2–6 weeks) and late (> 6 weeks) groups. The operative outcomes between the three groups were compared. RESULTS: We included 444 patients in the study, with 62 (14%), 90 (20%) and 292 (66%) patients in the early, intermediate and late groups, respectively. The median duration from ERCP to cholecystectomy was 75 days. There was no statistically significant difference in the conversion-to-open rate, bile leak rate or retained stones between the three groups. The median post-operative hospital stay (PHS) was 2, 2 and 1 day (P = 0.005) in the early, intermediate and late groups, respectively. The readmission rate was significantly more in the delayed group (3.2%, 11.1% and 13.7%; P = 0.05). Patients who suffered post-ERCP complications had a significantly longer PHS (4 vs 1 day, P = 0.001) and had higher conversion-to-open rate (16 vs 4.5%, P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Delayed cholecystectomy following ERCP is not associated with worse peri-operative outcomes and can facilitate more day-case surgery. However, early cholecystectomy can significantly reduce readmissions with gallstone-related symptoms and its associated hospital stay. Post-ERCP complications lead to a difficult cholecystectomy.","Abdalkoddus, Muhammad; Franklyn, Joshua; Ibrahim, Rashid; Yao, Lu; Zainudin, Nur; Aroori, Somaiah",Surg Endosc,565,3

Current clinical data suggest that, in COVID-19 patients, arterial hypertension (AH) is one of the most common cardiovascular comorbidities; it can worsen outcomes and increase the risk of admission to intensive care unit (ICU). The exact mechanisms through which AH contributes to the poor prognosis in COVID-19 are not yet clear. The putative relationship between AH and COVID-19 may be linked to the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a key element of the AH pathophysiology. Another mechanism connecting AH and COVID-19 is the dysregulation of the immune system resulting in a cytokine storm, mediated by an imbalanced response of T helper cells subtypes. Therefore, it is essential to optimize blood pressure control in hypertensive patients and monitor them carefully for cardiovascular and other complications for the duration of COVID-19 infection. The question whether AH-linked ACE2 gene polymorphisms increase the risk and/or worsen the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection should also receive further consideration.","Kamyshnyi, Alexander; Krynytska, Inna; Matskevych, Victoriya; Marushchak, Mariya; Lushchak, Oleh",Int J Hypertens,565,20

At the same time, the I7L proteinase exemplifies several interesting challenges from the rational drug design perspective. In the absence of a published I7L X-ray structure, we have built a detailed 3D model of the I7L ligand binding site (S2–S2′ pocket) based on exceptionally high structural conservation of this site in proteases of the ULP family. The accuracy and limitations of this model were assessed through comparative analysis of available X-ray structures of ULPs, as well as energy based conformational modeling. The 3D model of the I7L ligand binding site was used to perform covalent docking and VLS of a comprehensive library of about 230,000 available ketone and aldehyde compounds. Out of 456 predicted ligands, 97 inhibitors of I7L proteinase activity were confirmed in biochemical assays (∼20% overall hit rate). These experimental results both validate our I7L ligand binding model and provide initial leads for rational optimization of poxvirus I7L proteinase inhibitors. Thus, fragments predicted to bind in the prime portion of the active site can be combined with fragments on non-prime side to yield compounds with improved activity and specificity.","Katritch, Vsevolod; Byrd, Chelsea M.; Tseitin, Vladimir; Dai, Dongcheng; Raush, Eugene; Totrov, Maxim; Abagyan, Ruben; Jordan, Robert; Hruby, Dennis E.",J Comput Aided Mol Des,565,3

Respecto a las enteritis, bacterianas y virales, vigiladas en el SNMC, el rotavirus y el adenovirus han supuesto la segunda y la cuarta causa etiológica, respectivamente, en los niños menores de 5 años, después de Campylobacter y Salmonella. Conclusiones De los diferentes virus que pueden causar gastroenteritis aguda, hay otros virus con frecuencias elevadas, como calici-virus y astrovirus, que no se buscan sistemáticamente, por lo que hay que valorar las frecuencias con prudencia. A pesar de esto, el rotavirus es la principal causa de la gastroenteritis viral, y afecta principalmente a edades tempranas de la vida, sobre todo a niños de 1 a 11 meses, con un claro predominio en invierno. Respecto al adenovirus 40-41, se ha presentado preferentemente en niños menores de 2 años y con mayor frecuencia en otoño. La vacunación contra el rotavirus es prioritaria para poder disminuir el alto índice de morbilidad y mortalidad que ocasiona esta enfermedad. ABSTRACT Introduction Rotavirus is the main cause of severe diarrhea in children aged less than 5 years, leading to elevated morbidity and mortality worldwide. The aim of the present study was to determine the etiology of enteric viruses reported to the Catalan Microbiology Notification System (CMNS) (rotavirus and adenovirus 40-41) and to evaluate the importance of these viruses in enteric disease. Material and methods We retrospectively reviewed the notifications made from 1995-2002 by the laboratories of hospitals participating in the CMNS. Cases of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) were diagnosed by antigen detection in stools. The variables analyzed were: age, sex, month, and year of isolation. Statistical analysis was performed using the X2 test and Fisher's test and proportions were compared using the binomial test. The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05. Results Rotavirus was detected in 6708 cases of AGE (94.3%) and adenovirus 40-41 in 409 (5.7%). Viral AGE produced greater morbidity in children aged less than 2 years with 76% of cases caused by rotavi-rus and 68% of those caused by adenovirus 40-41 occurring in this age group. Rotavirus was isolated mainly in winter (68%), while adenovi-rus, although stable throughout the seasons, was more frequent in autumn (35.2%). Of cases of bacterial and viral enteritis detected by the CMNS, rotavirus was the second etiological agent and adenovirus the fourth in children aged less than 5 years after Campylobacter and Salmonella. Conclusions Of the various viruses that can cause AGE, some are highly frequent, such as calcivirus and astrovirus, which are not systematically detected and consequently the frequencies reported in the present study should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, rotavirus is the main cause of viral AGE, affecting small children, especially infants aged 1-11 months, with a clear predominance in winter. Adenovirus 40-41 mainly affects children aged less than 2 years and is more frequent in autumn. Vaccination against rotavirus should be a priority to reduce the high rates of morbidity and mortality caused by this disease.","Ciruela, P.; Izquierdo, C.; Oviedo, M.; Domínguez, A.",Vacunas,565,1

This study was to evaluate a pilot oral health interprofessional program that provided hands-on experiences for students across four disciplines: dentistry, medicine, nursing, and pharmacy. Methods: The 8-weeks program was built on four pedagogical principles: care, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration coupled with the 4Ms model: what matters, medication, mentation, and mobility. The curriculum contained four scenarios of a dental complication in an elderly: Alzheimer's Disease, oral cancer, Parkinson's Disease, and stroke. A mixed-methods approach was used to evaluate this pilot program. Results: The average score of knowledge and attitude has increased from 2.94 to 4.39 (p < 0.05) on a 5-point Likert scale. The qualitative responses also showed that students became more confident in practicing within the Age-Friendly health system. Discussion: By the end of the program, all students recognized the significance of the interprofessional program to improve their knowledge and skills to work with professionals across disciplines. Two key features that contributed to the success of the program were (1) an interprofessional education that increased students' awareness of other types of services and (2) four scenarios that allowed students to solve the case and gain hands-on experience. Conclusion: An interprofessional education may equip students with competence to address the health of geriatric patients. Materials used in this study could be shared and adapted to prepare learners for other scenarios that require interprofessional team practice.","Tabrizi, Maryam; Lee, Wei-Chen",Front Public Health,565,20

OBJECTIVES: To assess HBoV prevalence and associated disease in a cohort of respiratory patients in the East Midlands, UK between 2015 and 2019. STUDY DESIGN: We initially investigated the undiagnosed burden of HBoV in a retrospective paediatric cohort sampled between 2015 and 2017 using an in-house PCR assay. HBoV was subsequently incorporated into the standard respiratory diagnostic pathway and we audited a calendar year of HBoV positive results between 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Our retrospective PCR screening of previously routine diagnostic-negative samples from juvenile patients identified a 9% (n = 30) prevalence of HBoV type 1. These apparentHBoV1 mono-infections were frequently associated with respiratory tract symptoms, often severe including ventilation, oxygen and steroid intervention with 31% (n = 9) of individuals requiring intensive care. When HBoV screening was subsequently adopted into the routine respiratory diagnostic pathway, year-round infections were observed in both children and adults peaking in February. 185 of 9098 (2.03%) individuals were found to be HBoV positive with children aged 12-24 months the principally infected group. However, HBoV infection was also observed in patients aged over 60, predominantly as a mono-infection. 23% of the 185 unique patients were HBoV monoinfectedand persistent low-level DNA positivity was observed in 15 individuals up to 6-months after initial presentation. CONCLUSION: HBoV1 is a prevalent respiratory infection in the UK capable of causing serious monoinfections.","Bagasi, Arwa A.; Howson-Wells, Hannah C.; Clark, Gemma; Tarr, Alexander W.; Soo, Shiu; Irving, William L.; McClure, C.

Therefore, we aimed to estimate the SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence among children who presented to our hospital for non-COVID-19-related morbidity during the first and second epidemic wave in 2020 and compared these to the general Dutch paediatric population. Methods : We collected residual plasma samples from all paediatric patients (1 month-17 years of age) visiting our clinic or emergency room, who had blood drawing for various medical reasons. Samples were analysed for the presence of total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by Wantai ELISA. The seroprevalence in two separate periods (July-Sep 2020, and Oct-Dec 2020) was compared to regional and national data (PIENTER-Corona study, September 2020), and associations with co-morbidities were assessed. Results : A total of 209 samples in period 1 and 240 samples in period 2 were collected (median age 7.1 years, IQR 1.5-13.5). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 4.1% and 13.8%, respectively (p< 0.001). Seroprevalence was higher compared to national paediatric data, but did not differ with regional estimates. Most children with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were seen in the outpatient clinic for general paediatric problems with no differences in medical reasons for presentation between the two periods. Conclusions : These data confirm a rapid three-fold increase in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in paediatric patients in the second half of 2020 with a trend towards a higher seroprevalence compared to randomly-selected children in a nationwide study. Underlying morbidity in children might not play an important role in acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Rotee, I.L.M.; Ong, D.S.Y.; Koeleman, J.G.M.; Vos, E.R.A.; Tramper-Stranders, G. A.",,565,3

DESIGN An anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire survey. SETTING A large, mid-western academic general surgery residency program. PARTICIPANTS 47 PDs of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited General Surgery residency programs. RESULTS During the virtual-only interviews during the COVID-19 pandemic-era 2020-21 General Surgery residency application cycle, PDs shifted their focus to virtual outreach efforts and bolstered social media presences to recruit strong applicants. Also, our study found statistically significant changes to the increased value of letters of recommendation (LORs) for the PDs when assessing an applicant's commitment to surgery. These findings suggest that the necessity of adapting to the virtual-only interview format significantly altered how the PDs recruited and evaluated applicants for the General Surgery residency match. CONCLUSIONS A complete replacement of the in-person interviews with virtual-only interviews may be challenging unless buy-in exists from key stakeholders in the surgical community. Our study highlights the PDs' hesitation in assessing candidates' commitment to surgery from virtual interviews alone. Incorporating virtual interviews as a part of the screening process for applicants may serve as an avenue to maximize the benefits of the virtual interview format. Furthermore, COVID-19 pandemic has normalized the growing social media presence of residency programs, adding to the changing landscape of recruiting and interviewing applicants for General Surgery residency match.","Han, Amy Y; Obiri-Yeboah, Derrick; French, Judith C; Lipman, Jeremy M",Journal of surgical education,565,21

Herein we determined whether early changes in microRNAs (miRNAs) could be the underlying molecular mechanism increasing the risk of obese individuals to COVID-19 infection. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of plasma samples for circulating miRNAs showed a significant upregulation of miR-200c and a small increase in miR-let-7b obese individuals. This was associated with significant downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Both the miRNAs are the direct targets of ACE2, the specific functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Correlation analysis confirmed a significant negative correlation between ACE2 and both the miRNAs. Recent studies showed that despite being the functional receptor, inhibition/downregulation of ACE2 did not reduce the severity of COVID-19 infection. In contrast, increased angiotensin II following inhibition of ACE2 may increase the severity of the disease. Taken together, our novel results identify that upregulation of miR-200c may increase the susceptibility of obese individuals to COVID-19. Considering miRNA are the earliest molecular regulators, circulating miR-200c could be a potential biomarker in the early identification of those at the risk of severe COVID-19.","Bellae Papannarao, J.; Schwenke, D.; Manning, P.

However, gynecological emergencies and malignancies must be addressed despite the restricted resources and the need for protective measures against COVID-19. This study aimed to determine the types of gynecological surgeries performed, difficulties encountered, and their outcomes in the setting of the pandemic. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study over 6 months at a single tertiary center, including 60 women with gynecological complaints, categorized as emergencies and semi-emergencies, who underwent further surgery. Their surgical outcomes were measured through various parameters. RESULTS: We found that 68.3% were emergency cases, while the rest were classified as semi-emergencies. Fibroid and adenomyosis with failed medical management (48.3%), followed by cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (10%), and malignancies (10%) accounted for the semi-emergency cases, while ruptured ectopic pregnancies (13.3%) and torsion and ovarian cysts (18.4%) comprised the emergency cases. The decision to incision time between emergency and semi-emergency cases varied widely due to the safety prerequisites during the pandemic, ranging from 1 hour in emergency cases to 48 hours in semi-emergency cases. In addition, we studied the ease of preoperative preparation, patient satisfaction, and the average number of personnel available to run the operation theaters at these times.

In search of the cure, convalescent plasma (CP) containing protective antibodies from survivors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has shown potential benefit in a non-intensive care unit setting. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of CP therapy for patients with COVID-19 on mechanical ventilation (MV) and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: We conducted an open-label trial in a single center, Royal Hospital, in Oman. The study was conducted from 17 April to 20 June 2020. The trial included 94 participants with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. The primary outcomes included extubation rates, discharges from the hospital and overall mortality, while secondary outcomes were the length of stay and improvement in respiratory and laboratory parameters. Analyses were performed using univariate statistics. RESULTS: The overall mean age of the cohort was 50.0±15.0 years, and 90.4% (n = 85) were males. A total of 77.7% (n = 73) of patients received CP. Those on CP were associated with a higher extubation rate (35.6% vs. 76.2%; p < 0.001), higher extubation/home discharges rate (64.4% vs. 23.8%; p =0.001), and tendency towards lower overall mortality (19.2% vs. 28.6%; p =0.354; study power = 11.0%) when compared to COVID-19 patients that did not receive CP.

Understanding these patterns can help address barriers to care. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate how prescribing of opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder changed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic among both new and existing patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study, use of opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder from March 18 to September 1, 2020, was projected using a national database of retail prescriptions from January 1, 2018, to March 3, 2020. Actual prescribing was compared with projected levels for all, existing, and new patients. EXPOSURES: The data include prescriptions to patients independent of insurance status or type and cover 90% of retail prescriptions, 70% of mail-order prescriptions, and 70% of nursing home prescriptions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prescriptions for opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. Outcomes included total number of prescriptions, total morphine milligram equivalents, mean morphine milligram equivalents per prescription, mean dispensed units per prescription, and number of patients filling prescriptions. RESULTS: A total of 452 691 261 prescriptions for opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder were analyzed for 90 420 353 patients (50 921 535 female patients [56%]; mean [SD] age, 49 [20] years). From March 18 to May 19, 2020, 1877 million total morphine milligram equivalents of opioid analgesics were prescribed weekly vs 1843 million projected, a ratio of 102% (95% prediction interval [PI], 94%-111%; P = .71). The weekly number of opioid-naive patients receiving opioids was 370 051 vs 564 929 projected, or 66% of projected (95% PI, 63%-68%; P < .001). Prescribing of buprenorphine was as projected for existing patients, while the number of new patients receiving buprenorphine weekly was 9865 vs 12 008 projected, or 82% (95% PI, 76%-88%; P < .001). From May 20 to September 1, 2020, opioid prescribing for new patients returned to 100% of projected (95% PI, 96%-104%; P = .95), while the number of new patients receiving buprenorphine weekly was 10 436 vs 11 613 projected, or 90% (95% PI, 83%-97%; P = .009). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, existing patients receiving opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder generally maintained access to these medications during the COVID-19 pandemic. Opioid prescriptions for opioid-naive patients decreased briefly and then rebounded, while initiation of buprenorphine remained at a low rate through August 2020. Reductions in treatment entry may be associated with increased overdose deaths.","Currie, Janet M.; Schnell, Molly K.; Schwandt, Hannes; Zhang, Jonathan",JAMA Netw Open,565,24

However, the implementation of new European health standards in the Sami reindeer herding could have tremendous consequences on the evolution of this ancestral activity and the relationship between herders and reindeer. ABSTRACT: Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is the most transmissible of the prion diseases. In 2016, an unexpected case was found in Norway, the first in Europe. Since then, there have been 32 confirmed cases in Norway, Sweden, and Finland. This paper aims to examine the situation from a social and political perspective: considering the management of CWD in the Swedish part of Sápmi—the Sami ancestral land; identifying the place of the Sami people in the risk management–because of the threats to Sami reindeer herding that CWD presents; and understanding how the disease can modify the modalities of Indigenous reindeer husbandry, whether or not CWD is epizootic. Based on interviews with various stakeholders and by examining the social sciences literature, this paper shows that the health risk management is structured by a politico-scientific controversy about the recognition, or not, of atypical and classical CWD. The Sami herders are currently cooperating with the state authorities in the surveillance program to sample their herds. This involvement takes place in a situation where the balance of power between the Sami people and the state, or the European Union, is framed by its colonial context. This has consequences with respect to the definition of a common interest and to implementing sanitary measures. The particular features of reindeer herding are seen as a challenge to managing CWD risk, compared with European health standards. We argue that CWD will greatly modify the modalities of Indigenous reindeer herding, whether there are positive cases or not in the Sami reindeer. By implementing new health guidelines, the authorities will create a cascading effect in Sami land and its use. The CWD situation in Fennoscandia is full of uncertainty but may cause a major shift in the organization and the governance of Sápmi. In September 2020, the identification of a new CWD case in a wild reindeer in Norway started a new episode in the disease management in Fennoscandia. Our paper raises various questions linked to understanding this new step in this crisis which is not only epidemiological, but also socio-cultural and political.","Maraud, Simon; Roturier, Samuel",Animals (Basel),565,26

In this pandemic, transplantation activities have largely been affected worldwide. We are still facing with this pandemic; however, after regulations, we have started our transplantation activities. We report the first kidney transplantation whose recipient and living donor recovered from COVID-19. A 31-year-old male with renal failure was admitted for transplantation with an ABO-compatible relative. The recipient and the donor were tested for COVID-19 before transplantation, and they were both positive with a polymerase chain reaction. The recipient had minor symptoms and received therapy; the living donor also received therapy. Thirty days after recovery, surgery was performed successfully. The recipient was discharged with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), tacrolimus, and steroid 15 days after surgery. In the follow-up, they were both negative for COVID-19 45 days after surgery. Although there is missing literature regarding safety concerns and short-term follow-up, living-donor transplantation may be considered for patients, who recovered from COVID-19, after careful selection with paying attention to precautions.","Kucuk, Eyup Veli; Sit, Dede; Kayabasi, Hasan; Tahra, Ahmet; Sobay, Resul; Yilmaz, Seyma Nur Gunes; Karaoglu, Cagla; Ersoy Yesil, Ezgi",North Clin Istanb,565,0

However, the relationship between abdominal obesity and CXR severity score has not yet been fully explored. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed the association of different adiposity indexes, including waist circumference and body mass index (BMI), with CXR severity score in 215 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Patients with abdominal obesity showed significantly higher CXR severity scores and had higher rates of CXR severity scores ≥ 8 compared to those without abdominal obesity (P < 0.001; P = 0.001, respectively). By contrast, patients with normal weight, with overweight and those with BMI-based obesity showed no significant differences in either CXR severity scores or in the rates of CXR severity scores ≥ 8 (P = 0.104; P = 0.271, respectively). Waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) correlated more closely with CXR severity scores than BMI (r = 0.43, P < 0.001; r = 0.41, P < 0.001; r = 0.17, P = 0.012, respectively). The area under the curves (AUCs) for waist circumference and WHtR were significantly higher than that for BMI in identifying a high CXR severity score (≥ 8) (0.68 [0.60–0.75] and 0.67 [0.60–0.74] vs 0.58 [0.51–0.66], P = 0.001). A multivariate analysis indicated abdominal obesity (risk ratio: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.25–2.45, P < 0.001), bronchial asthma (risk ratio: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.07–2.81, P = 0.026) and oxygen saturation at admission (risk ratio: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94–0.97, P < 0.001) as the only independent factors associated with high CXR severity scores. CONCLUSION: Abdominal obesity phenotype is associated with a high CXR severity score better than BMI-based obesity in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Therefore, when visiting the patient in a hospital setting, waist circumference should be measured, and patients with abdominal obesity should be monitored closely.

This paper focuses on a risk decision-making problem in emergency response with several distinct characteristics including dynamic evolvement process of emergency, multiple scenarios, and impact of response actions on the emergency scenarios. A method based on Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is proposed to solve the problem. By analyzing the evolvement process of emergency, the Fault Tree (FT) is constructed to describe the logical relations among conditions and factors resulting in the evolvement of emergency. Given different feasible response actions, the probabilities of emergency scenarios are estimated by FTA. Furthermore, the overall ranking value of each action is calculated, and a ranking of feasible response actions is determined. Finally, a case study on H1N1 infectious diseases is given to illustrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed method.","Liu, Yang; Fan, Zhi-Ping; Yuan, Yuan; Li, Hongyan",Comput Oper Res,565,1

However, the suitability of fecal indicator bacteria to represent health risks is still being challenged, particularly in tropical aquatic environments. The objective of this study is to understand the occurrence and prevalence of indicators and pathogens in areas with contrasting land use, as well as to identify the major correlations between indicators, pathogens and environmental parameters. The spatial and temporal variation of indicators and pathogens was studied to examine the distribution patterns for areas with different land use, and the impact of seasonal changes on microbial populations. A total of 234 water samples were sampled for two years from reservoirs and their tributaries, and tested for fecal indicator bacteria, coliphages, human specific markers, pathogenic bacteria and viruses. The prevalence of indicators and pathogens in reservoirs were generally low, while relatively high concentrations were observed in tributaries to varying degrees. Of the enteric viruses, norovirus GII was among the most prevalent and had the highest concentration. Although strong correlations were found between indicators, only relatively weak correlations were found between indicators and pathogens. The results in this study showed that none of the bacteria/phage indicators were universal predictors for pathogens. Inclusion of the alternative indicators, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Bacteroides and human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) to monitoring programs could help to determine whether the fecal source was human. The microbial distribution patterns allow the classification of sampling sites to different clusters and thus, help to identify sites which have poor water quality. This approach will be useful for water quality management to pinpoint factors that influence water quality and help to prioritize sites for restoration of water quality.","Goh, Shin Giek; Saeidi, Nazanin; Gu, Xiaoqiong; Vergara, Genevieve Gabrielle Rose; Liang, Liang; Fang, Haoming; Kitajima, Masaaki; Kushmaro, Ariel; Gin, Karina Yew-Hoong",Water Res,565,20

Nrf2 is a transcription actor that helps maintain metabolic balance by providing redox-sensitive expression of numerous genes controlling normal day-to-day metabolic pathways. When ordinary metabolism is upset by extraordinary events such as injury, pathogenic infection, air or water pollution, ingestion of toxins, or simply by the slow but incessant changes brought about by aging and genetic variations, Nrf2 may also be called into action by the redox changes resulting from these events, whether acute or chronic. A complicating factor in all of this is that Nrf2 levels decline with aging, leaving the elderly less able to maintain proper redox balance. The dysregulated gene expression that results can cause or exacerbate a wide variety of pathological conditions, including susceptibility to viral infections. This review examines the characteristics desirable in Nrf2 activators that have therapeutic potential, as well as some of the patterns of dysregulated gene expression commonly observed during pulmonary infections and the normalizing effects possible by judicious use of phytochemicals to increase the activation level of available Nrf2.","McCord, Joe M.; Hybertson, Brooks M.; Cota-Gomez, Adela; Gao, Bifeng",Free Radic Biol Med,565,28

AIMS: This review article documents and critically assesses, for the first time; up to date categorized information about C. serrata including its reported pharmacological activities, cultural uses, active compounds, and botanical description. MATERIALS AND METHOD: s: All provided information about C. serrata was collected using the electronic databases (e.g. Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct and Springer Link), books (e.g. Trees of Pakistan and Herbalism, Phytochemistry, and Ethnopharmacology) and thesis. RESULTS: Qualitative and quantitative phytochemical studies on C. serrata revealed the presence of important chemical constituents such as; flavonoids, phenolic acids, alkaloids, saponins, tannins, and cardiac glycosides. The phytochemicals showed various in vitro activities like antioxidant, anti-infective, antiglycation, cytotoxic activities. Major areas of research conducted on C. serrata are its antioxidant and anti-infective activities. Few historical uses of C. serrata are supported by modern in vitro pharmacological studies such as; antidiarrheal, antidiabetic, and leishmanicidal activity. CONCLUSION: There were convincing evidence in in vitro studies supporting C. serrata antioxidant, anti-infective, anti-diabetic, anti-glycating, and cytotoxic activities. Nevertheless, all reported pharmacological activities were carried out in vitro and a gap in research i.e. preclinical and clinical investigation still exists. The authors emphasize the need for future in-depth research and clinical trials to investigate C. serrata pharmacological activity, clinical efficacy and safety. The potential chemical compounds with suggestive classes may need to be isolated and pharmacological activities must be established for these compounds.

The pathogenesis of diseases involves complex interactions of viruses, which differ in neurovirulence potential, and a number of host factors, which govern susceptibility to infection and the capacity to mount effective antiviral immune responses both in the periphery and within the CNS. This chapter summarizes progress in the field of flavivirus neuropathogenesis. Mosquito-borne and tickborne viruses are considered together. Flavivirus neuropathogenesis involves both neuroinvasiveness (capacity to enter the CNS) and neurovirulence (replication within the CNS), both of which can be manipulated experimentally. Neuronal injury as a result of bystander effects may be a factor during flavivirus neuropathogenesis given that microglial activation and elaboration of inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β and TNF-α, occur in the CNS during these infections and may accompany the production of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite, which can cause neurotoxicity.","Chambers, Thomas J; Diamond, Michael S",Advances in Virus Research,565,17

Specific support and interventions for carers may benefit both the carer, and their loved one with an ED. Individuals with co-occurring autism and EDs may present with additional needs and difficulties relating to their Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) that impact their carers. However, there is a lack of research exploring whether carers of people with ASC and EDs have specific support needs, and what kinds of support may be most beneficial for this population. METHODS: This study used a qualitative interview design, utilising peer interviews. Eleven carers participated in interviews about their experiences as a carer, and their views on existing support systems and potential improvements. As the study took place during the initial UK coronavirus lockdown, the impact of the lockdown also emerged as a topic during the interviews. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Five themes were identified: challenges associated with co-occurring Autism and EDs, a lack of existing support for carers from healthcare services, the personal impact of caring for someone with both ASC and EDs, ideas for how carers can be best supported, and the impact of the coronavirus on carers. CONCLUSIONS: Carers of loved ones with both ASC and EDs described the experience as having a significant personal impact on their lives, but also experienced a lack of support from healthcare services. There was a perception that caring for someone with both an ASC and EDs presents additional challenges compared to caring for someone with an ED only, and that this population therefore requires specialised support.

The COVID-19 disease includes, also damage to other organ systems as well as coagulopathy. The present report describes a case of COVID-19 presenting with acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) and subsequent acute limb ischemia (ALI). PRESENTATION OF CASE: An 84-years old hospitalized female patient presenting diabetes and recent COVID-19 reported acute onset of abdominal pain and typical findings of AMI. The CT-angiography confirmed the AMI secondary to a superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion. The patient was managed through an endovascular approach using a SMA mechanical thrombectomy and stenting with a good result. DISCUSSION: Treatment of this life-threatening condition includes surgical resection of the necrotic bowel, restoration of blood flow to the ischemic intestine and supportive measure - gastrointestinal decompression, fluid resuscitation, hemodynamic support. Endovascular management of AMI is preferred over the standard surgical approach due to a reduced mortality and morbidity rates. Imaging findings of intestinal necrosis, however, represent an indication for AMI surgical treatment with explorative laparotomy. Different endovascular solutions have been employed to address AMI including mechanical thrombectomy, local thrombolysis, and PTA-stenting. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 clinical presentation can be atypical, including gastrointestinal symptoms. If a first embolic event occurs, an aggressive anticoagulation treatment could be inefficient to reduce the risk of subsequent embolization events. The limited life expectancy of such revascularization procedures should orientate towards less invasive treatments.","Dinoto, E.; Ferlito, F.; La Marca, M.A.; Mirabella, D.; Bajardi, G.; Pecoraro, F.",Int J Surg Case Rep,565,0

Numerous clinical trials are being reviewed for use of different drugs, biologics, and vaccines in COVID-19. A much empirical approach will be to repurpose existing drugs for which pharmacokinetic and safety data are available, because this will facilitate the process of drug development. The article discusses the evidence available for the use of Ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug with antiviral properties, in COVID-19. METHODS: A rational review of the drugs was carried out utilizing their clinically significant attributes. A more thorough understanding was met by virtual embodiment of the drug structure and realizable viral targets using artificial intelligence (AI)-based and molecular dynamics (MD)-simulation-based study. CONCLUSION: Certain studies have highlighted the significance of ivermectin in COVID-19; however, it requires evidences from more Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) and dose- response studies to support its use. In silico-based analysis of ivermectin’s molecular interaction specificity using AI and classical mechanics simulation-based methods indicates positive interaction of ivermectin with viral protein targets, which is leading for SARS-CoV 2 N-protein NTD (nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain).","Kaur, Harpinder; Shekhar, Nishant; Sharma, Saurabh; Sarma, Phulen; Prakash, Ajay; Medhi, Bikash",Pharmacol Rep,565,28

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Second year medical students received instruction on direct ophthalmoscopy (DO) and SF; they were then paired with a peer and randomly assigned to perform DO or SF first. The SF technique involved freehand alignment of the axes of the smartphone camera with a condenser lens. Both techniques were done through a maximally dilated pupil. A questionnaire was completed to acquire data on baseline experience, performance of both examination techniques, attitudes, and appropriateness. Statistical significance testing and Bland-Altman analysis were used to determine differences between DO and SF, and a multivariable mixed regression model was fitted to identify any predictors for positive attitudes toward DO or SF. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-seven (137) individuals completed the study. A similar proportion of students could identify the optic nerve, macula, and vessels using DO and SF. However, self-reported quality scores were higher for DO for the optic nerve (p = 0.006) and macula (p = 0.08). The mean (standard deviation) attempts to identify these major structures were 2.7 (SD 2.3) for DO and 4.5 (SD 2.9) for SF (p < 0.001). Attitudes of students were consistently more positive toward DO across the five questions assessed. A small subset of students had equally positive attitudes toward DO and SF. Improved quality scores were predictive of positive attitudes for both DO and SF. Ultimately, 24% of students preferred SF over DO. CONCLUSION: Among inexperienced examiners of the fundus through a dilated pupil, SF is a non-inferior technique to DO in identifying structures. Despite overall favorable attitudes towards the more familiar DO, those students who quickly learned the SF technique had similar satisfaction scores. Teaching SF should be considered in undergraduate medical education.","Kohler, James; Tran, Tu M; Sun, Susan; Montezuma, Sandra R",Clin Ophthalmol,565,2

The objectives of this study were to estimate the cumulative incidence of porcine post-weaning diarrhea with different etiologies in production systems weaning without zinc oxide and prophylactic antimicrobials, to assess risk factors for post-weaning diarrhea, and to estimate the impact of post-weaning diarrhea on growth rate. A cohort study was conducted at two commercial indoor producers weaning without medicinal zinc oxide and prophylactic antimicrobials. RESULTS: Piglets were included at birth (n = 300) and 272 survived until weaning. After insertion to the nursery units, the piglets were clinically examined every day for 14 days, and rectal swabs were collected and analyzed for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and rotavirus A. The cumulative incidences of PWD the first 14 days after insertion to the nursery units were 41.8% (CI 33.6, 50.4) and 51.1% (CI 42.3, 60.0) at the two producers, respectively. We found a low incidence of cases associated to ETEC, and detected a substantial proportion of cases associated to rotavirus. We observed a biphasic pattern in the assumed etiology with rotavirus occurring first, and then a shift towards cases associated to ETEC/non-ETEC hemolytic E. coli. Being offspring of older sows was a protective factor for the development of PWD (Hazard ratio = 0.88 [CI 0.78, 0.99] per unit increase in parity of the dam). Low birth weight reduced the post-weaning growth rate (− 5.2 g/day [CI − 7.5, − 2.9] per 100 g decrease in birthweight) and increased the hazard of developing PWD (Hazard ratio for birthweight below 1100 g: 2.30 [CI 1.41–3.74]). The combined effect of having diarrhea for 2 days or more and receiving antimicrobial treatment was associated with an increased average daily weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests novel insights regarding pathogen dynamics and risk factors for PWD in productions not using prophylactic antimicrobials and medicinal zinc. The findings may have important implications for both antimicrobial usage and prevention strategies.

We investigated seroprevalence and immune responses in subjects professionally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and their family members (155 individuals; ages 5-79 years).

Anti-spike IgG titers remained high 60 days post-infection and did not associate with symptoms, but spike-specific IgM did associate with malaise and fever. We found limited household transmission, with children of infected individuals seldomly seropositive, highlighting professional exposure as the dominant route of infection in our cohort. We analyzed PBMCs from a subset of seropositive and seronegative adults. TLR7 agonist- activation revealed an increased population of IL-6+TNF-IL-1{beta}+ monocytes, while SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation elicited IL-33, IL-6, IFNa2, and IL-23 expression in seropositive individuals. IL-33 correlated with CD4+ T cell activation in PBMCs from convalescent subjects, and was likely due to T cell-mediated effects on IL-33- producing cells. IL-33 is associated with pulmonary infection and chronic diseases like asthma and COPD, but its role in COVID-19 is unknown. Analysis of published scRNAseq data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with mild to severe COVID-19 revealed a population of IL-33-producing cells that increases with disease.

Over 30 species of Cryptosporidium are recognized, some host specific whereas others infect a broader host range. Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium parvum are the species most commonly associated with human infection; C. hominis is largely associated only with human infections, but C. parvum is also associated with infection in animals, especially young ruminants. In some regions, cryptosporidiosis is a serious veterinary problem, particularly for calves, and lambs. Many outbreaks of human cryptosporidiosis have been associated with zoonotic transmission following contact with infected animals. In Africa, where cryptosporidiosis is a major contributor to pediatric morbidity and mortality, evidence suggests transmission is principally anthroponotic. Given the frequent close contact between humans and animals in Africa, the apparent predominance of human-to-human transmission is both interesting and puzzling. In this article, after a brief “text book” introduction to the parasite, we consider in separate sections the different aspects of relevance to Cryptosporidium transmission in African countries, describing different aspects of the various species and subtypes in human and animal infections, considering livestock management practices in different African countries, and looking for any characteristic “hot spots” where zoonotic transmission has apparently occurred. Studies where transmission networks have been investigated are particularly relevant. Finally, in a separate section, we try to gather these different strands of evidence together in order to assess the reasons behind the apparent predominance of anthroponotic transmission in Africa. Reviewing the available evidence provides an opportunity to re-think transmission pathways, not only in Africa but also elsewhere, and also to pose questions. Does the predominance of human-to-human transmission in Africa reflect a relative absence of zoonotic C. parvum in African livestock? Are Africans less susceptible to zoonotic Cryptosporidium infection, perhaps resulting from early immunostimulation by C. hominis or due to inherent genetic traits? Is the African environment—in all its variety—simply more detrimental to oocyst survival? Will the so-called hypertransmissible subtypes, currently relatively rare in Africa, be introduced from Europe or elsewhere, and, if so, will they fade out or establish and spread? Our intention with this manuscript is not only to summarize and consolidate diverse data, thereby providing an overview of data gaps, but also to provide food for thought regarding transmission of a parasite that continues to have a considerable impact on both human and animal health.","Robertson, Lucy J.; Johansen, Øystein Haarklau; Kifleyohannes, Tsegabirhan; Efunshile, Akinwale Michael; Terefe, Getachew",Front Vet Sci,565,32

Although, dog overpopulation is still a current problem, the importance of dogs as companion or work animals is undeniable. The source of the dog (size and type of kennels) seems to affect its performance and its life outcome. To understand the perception of dog breeders and puppy production in western societies, an online international survey was sent to breeders in North and South America, Europe and Oceania. The survey focused on breeders’ demographics and maternal behaviour and stress during the peripartum period. Overall, based on the responders’ feedback, puppy production is an activity driven partially by small-scale hobby or sporadic breeders. A close relation between dogs and breeders has been observed in different countries with small differences. In general, stress reduction during strategic times was a common concern amongst breeders who were using slightly different interventions. Spending more time with the bitches to reassure them was commonly employed. ABSTRACT: Dogs are part of many households worldwide and in recent years in some western countries, more and more people describe them as members of the family. The accurate number of dogs per household and the actual demand for puppies are hard to estimate correctly. The sources of dogs seem to be an important element to consider before acquiring a dog since some behavioural disorders are more likely observed in dogs coming from puppy mills and pet stores. Therefore, there is an increased need to better-know dog breeders, theirs believes and practices. To full-fill this objective, an online questionnaire in five different languages (English, German, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish) was sent to dog breeders. The survey intended to study the demographics of dog breeders and to understand their perception and practices about reproduction, maternal behaviour and management of the dam during the peripartum period. We were also interested to evaluate the occurrence and the impact of stress around parturition and how breeders deal with overstressed bitches and if they believe that motherly quality could have a later-on effect on the livelihood of the dog. Six hundred and sixty-eight respondents participated in the survey, mainly from Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Portugal, Poland, Spain, United Kingdom, United States of America and non-listed country (reported as ‘other’ in the survey). A country effect was observed in relation to housing system, human interaction, the use of techniques to define breeding and whelping time and different methods to manage stress during the peripartum period. Considering the demographics of the responders, breeding activity is, in general, a family based activity with an effect of country. Use of progesterone levels to manage reproduction and pregnancy diagnosis by ultrasound were cited as common practice. In general, parturition takes place under human supervision. Peripartum period was perceived as a stressful moment with a difference in the way of addressing the problem based on the country but reassuring the bitch by increasing human presence was frequently described. Inappropriate maternal behaviour was observed by half of responders and if presented primiparous bitches and parturition by C-section were overrepresented. Puppies stayed with the dams from 4 weeks to 9 weeks and dog breeders from Spain, Poland and Portugal are keeping puppies with their mother the longest. Overall, poor maternal behaviour has an impact on puppies’ cognitive development with German breeders being more convinced than their counterparts from Brazil and Spain.","Santos, Natalia Ribeiro; Beck, Alexandra; Maenhoudt, Cindy; Billy, Charlotte; Fontbonne, Alain",Animals (Basel),565,16

How these diverse receptor recognition patterns affect viral entry is unknown. Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) is the only known coronavirus that uses the N-terminal domain (NTD) of its spike to recognize a protein receptor, CEACAM1a. Here we determined the cryo-EM structure of MHV spike complexed with mouse CEACAM1a. The trimeric spike contains three receptor-binding S1 heads sitting on top of a trimeric membrane-fusion S2 stalk. Three receptor molecules bind to the sides of the spike trimer, where three NTDs are located. Receptor binding induces structural changes in the spike, weakening the interactions between S1 and S2. Using protease sensitivity and negative-stain EM analyses, we further showed that after protease treatment of the spike, receptor binding facilitated the dissociation of S1 from S2, allowing S2 to transition from pre-fusion to post-fusion conformation. Together these results reveal a new role of receptor binding in MHV entry: in addition to its well-characterized role in viral attachment to host cells, receptor binding also induces the conformational change of the spike and hence the fusion of viral and host membranes. Our study provides new mechanistic insight into coronavirus entry and highlights the diverse entry mechanisms used by different viruses.","Shang, Jian; Wan, Yushun; Liu, Chang; Yount, Boyd; Gully, Kendra; Yang, Yang; Auerbach, Ashley; Peng, Guiqing; Baric, Ralph; Li, Fang",PLoS Pathog,565,24

The present study reported on cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence and longevity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs at a regional hospital system in Orange County, California, between May and August, 2020. Data from HCWs (n=3,458) were included in the analysis. Data from first responders (n=226) were also analyzed for comparison. A blood sample was collected at study enrollment and 8-week follow-up. Information on job duties, location, COVID-19 symptoms, polymerase chain reaction test history, travel since January 2020, and household contacts with COVID-19 was collected. Comparisons to estimated community prevalence were also evaluated. Observed antibody prevalence was 0.93% and 2.58% at initial and 8-week follow-up, respectively, for HCWs, and 5.31% and 4.35% for first responders. For HCWs, significant differences (p < .05) between negative vs. positive at initial assessment were found for age, race, fever, and loss of smell, and at 8-week follow-up for age, race, and all symptoms. Antibody positivity persisted at least 8 weeks in this cohort. Among 75 HCWs with self-reported prior PCR-confirmed COVID-19, 35 (46.7%) were antibody negative. Significant differences between negative vs. positive were observed in age and frequency of symptoms. This study found considerably lower SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among HCWs compared with prior published studies. This may be explained by better safety measures in the workplace, heightened awareness inside and outside of the workplace, possibly lower susceptibility due to innate immunity and other biological heterogeneity, and low COVID-19 prevalence in the community itself.

Was there a research base available to help schools prepare students for reading and writing digital texts? The ability to read, analyze, compose, and communicate with digital texts requires digital literacies. However, the rapid-fire development of information and communication technologies (ICTs) makes the identification of digital literacies and the development of curriculum and instruction a moving target. In her Literacy Research Association Presidential Address, Dr. Betsy Baker asserts that digital literacies are no longer an entity separate from reading and writing instruction, they are no longer a technology issue, students live in a digital world, and digital literacies are not optional. Digital literacies have become the literacies of our culture. Baker synthesizes over 25 years of research to propose that digital literacies are persistently public, semiotic, product-oriented, and transitory. Researchers, educational leaders, and teachers can leverage these characteristics as footholds to identify ever-changing digital literacies, design curricula, and provide instruction so that all students can be autonomous as they seek to thrive in a digital world.

METHODS: Cancer survivors with chronic CIPN pain were recruited from the breast, gastrointestinal, and gynecological oncology centers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Participants were randomized (2:1) to receive an 8-week yoga intervention or usual care. After 21/50 of participants were enrolled, the COVID-19 pandemic required the yoga intervention to be delivered virtually (i.e., Zoom). Pre- and post-intervention, participants self-reported CIPN and co-occurring symptom severity. Adherence to the intervention was defined as practicing ≥ 12 yoga sessions over the 8-week intervention period. Changes in patient-reported outcomes between groups were compared using Wilcoxon’s rank-sum tests. RESULTS: Participants (n = 28 yoga, n = 16 control) were mainly female (96%) and diagnosed with stage III/IV disease (66%). Overall, 19/28 (67.8%) of yoga group participants were adherent to the yoga protocol. Yoga group participants experienced significant within-group improvements in all patient-reported outcomes, including worst CIPN pain (median change = − 1.7, p < 0.0001) and sensory CIPN (median change = − 14.8, p < 0.0001), but only improvements in fatigue (p = 0.05) and depression (p = 0.04) were significant compared to the control. There were no differences (p > 0.05) in changes in patient-reported outcomes between in-person (n = 6) or virtual (n = 15) yoga group participants. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga is a feasible non-pharmacological modality for cancer survivors with CIPN, but more information is needed regarding its impact on CIPN and other symptoms.

The current situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic makes this problem particularly relevant. Assume that each center corresponds to an assigned place for vaccination and that each center uses one or more vaccine brands/laboratories. Then, each patient could choose a center instead of another, because she/he may prefer the vaccine from a more reliable laboratory. This defines an order of preference that might depend on each patient who may not want to be vaccinated in a center where there are only her/his non-preferred vaccine brands. In countries where the vaccination process is considered successful, the order assigned by each patient to the vaccination centers is defined by incentives that local governments give to their population. These same incentives for foreign citizens are seen as a strategic decision to generate income from tourism. The simple plant/center location problem (SPLP) is a combinatorial approach that has been extensively studied. However, a less-known natural extension of it with order (SPLPO) has not been explored in the same depth. In this case, the size of the instances that can be solved is limited. The SPLPO considers an order of preference that patients have over a set of facilities to meet their demands. This order adds a new set of constraints in its formulation that increases the complexity of the problem to obtain an optimal solution. In this paper, we propose a new two-stage stochastic formulation for the SPLPO (2S-SPLPO) that mimics the mentioned pandemic situation, where the order of preference is treated as a random vector. We carry out computational experiments on simulated 2S-SPLPO instances to evaluate the performance of the new proposal. We apply an algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation that has been shown to be efficient for large instances of the SPLPO. A potential application of this new algorithm to COVID-19 vaccination is discussed and explored based on sensor-related data. Two further algorithms are proposed to store the patient’s records in a data warehouse and generate 2S-SPLPO instances using sensors.","Cabezas, Xavier; García, Sergio; Martin-Barreiro, Carlos; Delgado, Erwin; Leiva, Víctor",Sensors (Basel),565,1

Climate change poses a growing threat to this already dire situation. While considerable effort has been placed in public health campaigns in the highest-risk regions, and national malaria maps are updated to account for changing climate, malaria cases have increased. This pilot study considers the sub-population of South Africans who reside outside of the malaria area, yet have the means to travel into this high-risk region for vacation. Through the lens of the governmental “ABC of malaria prevention”, we explore this sub-population’s awareness of the current boundaries to the malaria area, perceptions of the future boundary under climate change, and their risk-taking behaviours relating to malaria transmission. Findings reveal that although respondents self-report a high level of awareness regarding malaria, and their boundary maps reveal the broad pattern of risk distribution, their specifics on details are lacking. This includes over-estimating both the current and future boundaries, beyond the realms of climate-topographic possibility. Despite over-estimating the region of malaria risk, the respondents reveal an alarming lack of caution when travelling to malaria areas. Despite being indicated for high-risk malaria areas, the majority of respondents did not use chemoprophylaxis, and many relied on far less-effective measures. This may in part be due to respondents relying on information from friends and family, rather than medical or governmental advice.","Fitchett, Jennifer M; Swatton, Deryn-Anne",Int J Biometeorol,565,11

Methods: This cross-sectional hospital-based study included 106,279 eyes operated between March 23, 2019 and March 31, 2021. The data of patients who underwent cataract surgery presenting during the lockdown and unlock phases were compared with the respective periods in the previous year before COVID-19. Results: The cataract surgeries performed decreased to 5.6% (839/14,994) of pre-COVID-19 volumes during the lockdown phase. There was a gradual recovery of the cataract surgeries performed to 86.7% of pre-COVID-19 volumes by May 2020 and exceeded by 17.9% by September 2020. There was a decrease in the number of women who underwent cataract surgery during the lockdown phase (49.11%) compared to the pre-COVID-19 (52.59%) or unlock phase (52.29%, P < 0.001). Patients operated during the lockdown phase were younger when compared to other groups (P < 0.001).

Most of the scientifically tested apps are based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles, which are considered the gold standard for the treatment of most mental health problems. OBJECTIVE: This review investigates standalone smartphone-based ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) built on principles derived from CBT that aim to improve mental health. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and PubMed databases for peer-reviewed studies published between January 1, 2007, and January 15, 2020. We included studies focusing on standalone app-based approaches to improve mental health and their feasibility, efficacy, or effectiveness. Both within- and between-group designs and studies with both healthy and clinical samples were included. Blended interventions, for example, app-based treatments in combination with psychotherapy, were not included. Selected studies were evaluated in terms of their design, that is, choice of the control condition, sample characteristics, EMI content, EMI delivery characteristics, feasibility, efficacy, and effectiveness. The latter was defined in terms of improvement in the primary outcomes used in the studies. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies were selected. The results show that EMIs based on CBT principles can be successfully delivered, significantly increase well-being among users, and reduce mental health symptoms. Standalone EMIs were rated as helpful (mean 70.8%, SD 15.3; n=4 studies) and satisfying for users (mean 72.6%, SD 17.2; n=7 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Study quality was heterogeneous, and feasibility was often not reported in the reviewed studies, thus limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the existing data. Together, the studies show that EMIs may help increase mental health and thus support individuals in their daily lives. Such EMIs provide readily available, scalable, and evidence-based mental health support. These characteristics appear crucial in the context of a global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic but may also help reduce personal and economic costs of mental health impairment beyond this situation or in the context of potential future pandemics.","Marciniak, Marta Anna; Shanahan, Lilly; Rohde, Judith; Schulz, Ava; Wackerhagen, Carolin; Kobylińska, Dorota; Tuescher, Oliver; Binder, Harald; Walter, Henrik; Kalisch, Raffael; Kleim, Birgit",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,565,24

Remotely delivered Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (rCBT) for SHA is evidenced as effective, but many who seek help do not benefit. Motivational processes can influence outcomes, but it is unclear what assessment methods offer the best clinical utility in rCBT for SHA. DESIGN: This study compared the predictive validity of patient, therapist and in-session ratings of motivational factors taken at session two of rCBT for SHA among high healthcare users experiencing multimorbidity. METHODS: Motivational factors were assessed for 56 participants who attended at least two sessions of CBT for SHA delivered via video-conferencing or telephone. Following session two, therapists and patients completed online assessments of patient motivation. Two trained observers also rated motivational factors and therapeutic alliance from in-session interactions using session two recordings and transcripts. Multilevel modelling was used to predict health anxiety and a range of secondary health outcomes from motivation assessments. RESULTS: Where patients were more actively engaged in discussion of positive changes during session two, greater outcome improvements ensued in health anxiety and all secondary outcomes. Conversely, larger proportions of session two spent describing problems predicted poorer outcomes. Therapist and patient assessments of motivation did not predict health anxiety, but therapist assessments of client confidence and motivation predicted all secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Motivation remains an important process in CBT when delivered remotely, and motivational factors may predict outcomes more consistently from in-session interactions, compared to self-reports.","Malins, Sam; Moghaddam, Nima; Morriss, Richard; Schröder, Thomas; Brown, Paula; Boycott, Naomi",Br. j. clin. psychol,565,33

Proximity ligation sequencing identify hundreds of RNA-RNA interactions within the virus genome and between the virus and host RNAs. SARS-CoV-2 genome binds strongly to mitochondrial and small nucleolar RNAs and is extensively 2’-O-methylated. 2’-O-methylation sites are enriched in viral untranslated regions, associated with increased virus pair-wise interactions, and are decreased in host mRNAs upon virus infection, suggesting that the virus sequesters methylation machinery from host RNAs towards its genome.

METHODS AND RESULTS: 38 patients diagnosed with MM between January 2016 and January 2020 and 50 healthy controls were included in the study. The initial hypermethylation of the patients and the healthy control group were statistically analyzed. In addition, the increase in hypermethylation in the MM group before and after the first series of treatments were analyzed within themselves. There is a significant difference between the patients with MM diagnosis and the healthy control group in terms of the initial global hypermethylation (P = 0.001). In patients with MM, hypermethylation was significantly higher. Global hypermethylation in the post-treatment measurements was significantly increased in comparison to the pre-treatment state (P = 0.012).

There were 558 patients (7.1%) with rescue PCI and 7271 with PPCI. 30-day all-cause mortality (rescue PCI 6% vs. PPCI 5%, p = 0.47) and MACE (rescue PCI 10.3% vs. PPCI 8.9%, p = 0.26) rates were similar between the two groups. Rates of in-hospital major bleeding (rescue PCI 6% vs. PPCI 3.4%, p = 0.002) and 30-day stroke (rescue PCI 2.2% vs. PPCI 0.8%, p < 0.001) were higher following rescue PCI. The odds ratio for haemorrhagic stroke in the rescue PCI group was 10.3. Long-term mortality was not significantly different between the groups (rescue PCI 20% vs. PPCI 19%, p = 0.33). CONCLUSIONS: With contemporary interventional techniques and medical therapy, rescue PCI remains a valuable strategy for treating patients with failed fibrinolysis where PPCI is unavailable and it has been suggested in extenuating circumstances where alternative revascularisation strategies are considered.","Fernando, Himawan; Dinh, Diem; Duffy, Stephen J.; Brennan, Angela; Sharma, Anand; Clark, David; Ajani, Andrew; Freeman, Melanie; Peter, Karlheinz; Stub, Dion; Hiew, Chin; Reid, Christopher M.; Oqueli, Ernesto",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,565,27

Exosomes are involved in the pathogenesis of diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, pregnancy disorders and cardiovascular diseases, and have emerged as potential non-invasive biomarkers for the detection, prognosis and therapeutics of a myriad of diseases. In this review, we describe recent advances related to the regulatory mechanisms of exosome biogenesis, release and molecular composition, as well as their role in health and disease, and their potential use as disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of their main isolation methods, characterization and cargo analysis, as well as the experimental methods used for exosome-mediated drug delivery, are discussed. Finally, we present potential perspectives for the use of exosomes in future clinical practice.","Mosquera-Heredia, Maria I.; Morales, Luis C.; Vidal, Oscar M.; Barceló, Ernesto; Silvera-Redondo, Carlos; Vélez, Jorge I.; Garavito-Galofre, Pilar",Biomedicines,565,24

Many instances of in-flight transmission have been documented, but the relative influence of the many factors (see below) affecting in-flight transmission has not been quantified. Long-standing guidance by public health agencies is that the primary transmission risk associated with air travel for most respiratory infectious diseases is associated with sitting within two rows of an infectious passenger. The effect of proximity may be one of these factors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the risk of infection within and beyond the 2-row rule given by public health guidance. METHODS: We searched the literature for reports of in-flight transmission of infection which included seat maps indicating where the infectious and infected passengers were seated. FINDINGS: There is a ∼ 6% risk to passengers seated within the 2-rows of infected individual(s) and there is ∼ 2% risk to passengers seated beyond 2-rows from the infectious individual. DISCUSSION: Contact tracing limited to passengers within 2-rows of the infectious individual(s) could fail to detect other cases of infections. This has important consequences for assessing the spread of infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Infection at a distance from the index case indicates other factors, such as airflow, movement of passenger/crew members, fomites and contacts between passengers in the departure gate before boarding, or after deplaning, are involved.","Hertzberg, Vicki Stover; Weiss, Howard",Ann Glob Health,565,13

METHODS: Results of all real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV‑2 performed at our radio-oncology department between 13 October 2020 and 11 March 2021 were included. Clinical data and anamnestic information at the time of testing were documented and examined for (i) the presence of COVID-19-related symptoms and (ii) virus-related anamnesis (high-risk [prior positive test or contact to a positive tested person within the last 14 days] or low-risk [inconspicuous anamnesis within the last 14 days]). RESULTS: A total of 1056 SARS-CoV‑2 tests in 543 patients were analyzed. Of those, 1015 tests were performed in asymptomatic patients and 41 tests in patients with COVID-19-associated symptoms. Two of 940 (0.2%) tests in asymptomatic patients with low-risk anamnesis and three of 75 (4.0%) tests in asymptomatic patients with high-risk anamnesis showed a positive result. For symptomatic patients, SARS-CoV‑2 was detected in three of 36 (8.3%) low-risk and three of five (60.0%) high-risk tests. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the correlation between individual risk factors and positivity rates of SARS-CoV‑2 tests in cancer patients. The data demonstrate that clinical and anamnestic assessment is a simple and effective measure to distinctly increase SARS-CoV‑2 test efficiency. This might enable cancer centers to adjust test strategies in asymptomatic patients, especially when test resources are scarce.

Personal protective equipment (PPE) has been tailored accordingly, but as of April 2020, close to 10 000 health care workers in the United States have contracted COVID-19 despite wearing recommended PPE. As such, standard guidelines for PPE may be inadequate for the health care worker performing high-risk aerosolizing procedures such as endotracheal intubation. In this brief technical report, we describe the integration of an orthopedic hood cover as an item for full barrier protection against COVID-19 transmission. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The Coronavirus Airway Task Force at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center approved this initiative and went live with the full barrier suit during the last week of March 2020. The PPE described in this report includes a Stryker T4 Hood, normally used in conjunction with the Stryker Steri-Shield T4 Helmet. Instead of the helmet, the hood is secured to the head via a baseball cap and binder clip. This head covering apparatus is to be used as an accessory to other PPE items that include an N95 mask, waterproof gown, and disposable gloves. The motor ventilation system is not used in order to prevent airborne viral entry into the hood. DISCUSSION: An advantage of the full barrier suit is an additional layer of droplet protection during intubation. The most notable disadvantage is the absence of a ventilation system within the hood covering. CONCLUSION: Modification of existing PPE may provide protection for health care workers during high-risk aerosolizing procedures such as endotracheal intubation. Although the integration of this medical equipment meets the immediate needs of an escalating crisis, further innovation is on the horizon. More research is needed to confirm the safety of modified PPE.","Wills, Timothy T.; Zuelzer, Wilhelm A.; Tran, Bryant W.",Geriatr Orthop Surg Rehabil,565,16

Therefore, the aim of this study was to review studies that evaluated physical and mental health problems post-COVID-19. Methods Articles for inclusion in this scoping review were identified by searching the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases for items dated from 1 January to 7 November 2020. Observational studies evaluating physical health (musculoskeletal symptoms, functional status) or mental health status with a follow-up period longer than 1 month after discharge or after the onset of symptoms were included. Results This scoping review included 34 studies with follow-up periods of up to 3 months post-COVID-19. The most commonly reported physical health problems were fatigue (range 28% to 87%), pain (myalgia 4.5% to 36%), arthralgia (6.0% to 27%), reduced physical capacity (six-minute walking test range 180 to 561 m), and declines in physical role functioning, usual care and daily activities (reduced in 15% to 54% of patients). Common mental health problems were anxiety (range 6.5% to 63%), depression (4% to 31%) and post-traumatic stress disorder (12.1% to 46.9%). Greater fatigue, pain, anxiety and depression were reported in female patients and individuals admitted to intensive care. An overall lower quality of life was seen up to 3 months post-COVID-19. Conclusions This review highlights the presence of several physical and mental health problems up to 3 months post-COVID-19. The findings point to the need for comprehensive evaluation and rehabilitation post-COVID-19 to promote quality of life.","Shanbehzadeh, Sanaz; Tavahomi, Mahnaz; Zanjari, Nasibeh; Ebrahimi-Takamjani, Ismail; Amiri-arimi, Somayeh",J Psychosom Res,565,1

Here, we examined associations between household availability of improved drinking water and sanitation, respectively, and use of maternal and child health (MCH) services in South Asian countries. Demographic and Health Survey population-based data from Bangladesh, Nepal, India, and Pakistan were used, restricted to women with a child aged 0–36 months (n = 145,262). Types of households’ water source and sanitation facilities were categorized based on the World Health Organization and UNICEF’s definitions of “improved” and “unimproved”. We applied logistic regressions to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for improved water and sanitation, respectively, and reported antenatal care visits, having a skilled attendant at birth, and infant vaccination coverage, stratified by maternal education. Among lower educated women, access to improved water source was associated with greater ORs for presence of a skilled attendant at delivery and their children having up-to-date immunizations (OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.17, 1.42). Among lower and higher educated women, improved sanitation (vs. unimproved) was associated with greater ORs for having had adequate antenatal care visits (OR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.62, 1.88; OR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.62, 1.80), and similarly for having had a skilled attendant at birth, and children with up-to-date immunizations.

We aimed to gain insight in possible sources of infection in health-care workers. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional study at three of the nine hospitals located in the south of the Netherlands. We screened health-care workers at the participating hospitals for SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on clinical symptoms (fever or mild respiratory symptoms) in the 10 days before screening. We obtained epidemiological data through structured interviews with health-care workers and combined this information with data from whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples taken from health-care workers and patients. We did an in-depth analysis of sources and modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in health-care workers and patients. FINDINGS: Between March 2 and March 12, 2020, 1796 (15%) of 12 022 health-care workers were screened, of whom 96 (5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We obtained complete and near-complete genome sequences from 50 health-care workers and ten patients. Most sequences were grouped in three clusters, with two clusters showing local circulation within the region. The noted patterns were consistent with multiple introductions into the hospitals through community-acquired infections and local amplification in the community. INTERPRETATION: Although direct transmission in the hospitals cannot be ruled out, our data do not support widespread nosocomial transmission as the source of infection in patients or health-care workers.

Infancy is also a critical time for post-natal lung growth and development. Severe or repeated lower airway injury in very young children likely increases the likelihood of chronic pulmonary disorders later in life. Globally, bronchiolitis is the most common form of acute lower respiratory infections during infancy. Compared with non-Indigenous Australian infants, Indigenous infants have greater bacterial density in their upper airways and more severe bronchiolitis episodes. Our study tests the hypothesis that the anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties of azithromycin, improve the clinical outcomes of Indigenous Australian infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis. METHODS: We are conducting a dual centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial in northern Australia. Indigenous infants (aged ≤ 24-months, expected number = 200) admitted to one of two regional hospitals (Darwin, Northern Territory and Townsville, Queensland) with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis and fulfilling inclusion criteria are randomised (allocation concealed) to either azithromycin (30 mg/kg/dose) or placebo administered once weekly for three doses. Clinical data are recorded twice daily and nasopharyngeal swab are collected at enrolment and at the time of discharge from hospital. Primary outcomes are 'length of oxygen requirement' and 'duration of stay,' the latter based upon being judged as 'ready for respiratory discharge'. The main secondary outcome is readmission for a respiratory illness within 6-months of leaving hospital. Descriptive virological and bacteriological (including development of antibiotic resistance) data from nasopharyngeal samples will also be reported. DISCUSSION: Two published studies, both involving different patient populations and settings, as well as different macrolide antibiotics and treatment duration, have produced conflicting results. Our randomised, placebo-controlled trial of azithromycin in Indigenous infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis is designed to determine whether it can reduce short-term (and potentially long-term) morbidity from respiratory illness in Australian Indigenous infants who are at high risk of developing chronic respiratory illness. If azithromycin is efficacious in reducing the morbidly of Indigenous infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis, the intervention would lead to improved short term (and possibly long term) health benefits.

Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the awareness and prevalence of General Anxiety Disorder (GAD) with regard to COVID-19 among the Hail community, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in order to help health authorities to effectively control the pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was completed by 412 participants living in Hail, Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire assessed demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, and practices for the prevention of COVID-19, as well as psychological feelings in terms of GAD as an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The study found that most of the respondents demonstrated good knowledge, attitudes, and practice for COVID-19 prevention. The elderly and employed demonstrated significant positive attitudes and practices (p < 0.05). Participants with a positive attitude were almost two and a half times (OR = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.54–3.99) more likely to have good practices. Additionally, the rural respondents were less likely (OR = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.21–0.96) to have a positive attitude. Married participants were more than one and a half (OR = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.04–2.44) times more likely to have a positive attitude. The prevalence of GAD was 21.8% and was significantly increased among participants with inadequate knowledge (OR = 2.01; 95% CI: 1.25–3.22), females (OR = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.19–3.09), individuals with chronic diseases (OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.02–2.86), and non-Saudi participants (OR = 2.44; 95% CI: 1.02–5.85). Conclusions: Ensuring a sufficient combination of relatively good levels of knowledge, positive attitudes, and desired practices serves as a good approach to preventing the spread of COVID-19. However, the increased prevalence of GAD requires the attention of policymakers. Therefore, a great emphasis should be placed on health awareness campaigns, with a focus on misconceptions and the provision of counseling.","Alsaif, Bandar; Elhassan, Najm Eldinn Elsser; Itumalla, Ramaiah; Ali, Kamal Elbassir; Alzain, Mohamed Ali",Int J Environ Res Public Health,565,24

We investigated whether individualized tidal volume and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) delivery is possible to lungs of different compliances that are being simultaneously ventilated from one anesthesia ventilator. Methods: We performed a controlled experiment in an operating room environment without animal or human participants. Two test lungs were connected to distinct modified Y-pieces that were ventilated in parallel from a single anesthesia ventilator. Results: Ventilation can be manipulated to qualitatively deliver individually tailored tidal volumes in the setting of varying PEEP and compliance requirements in pressure control mode. Conclusions: Splitting ventilators, or multi-ventilation, is a viable alternative to acute ventilator shortage during a pandemic.

The current article investigates this notion in four separate studies, and we also assess the mediating effect of face mask perceptions between age and face mask wearing using the eight-dimension Face Masks Perceptions Scale (FMPS). The sample-size weighted average correlation between age and face mask wearing was −.07 (95%C.I.[−.14, .001], Z-value = −1.928, P = .054, n = 824), indicating that older individuals are slightly less likely to wear face masks compared to younger individuals. Age did not have significant relations with any face mask perceptions, and the mediating effect of face mask perceptions was not robust or consistent. This indicates that the relation between age and face mask wearing is not explained by face mask perceptions, and researchers must turn to other explanatory mechanisms to understand this relation. We propose possible avenues, such as dual-system theories, to further investigate this research question as well as others associated with face mask perceptions, face mask wearing and the COVID-19 pandemic.","Howard, Matt C",J Public Health (Oxf),565,20

We compared the actual number and rate of completed, canceled, and no-show visits between an 8-week period in 2019, when we exclusively conducted visits in person and the same 8-week period in 2020, during the COVID-19 quarantine, when we exclusively conducted visits via telehealth. METHODS: We used electronic health record data for all patients, as well as Dexcom continuous glucose monitoring data collected for a subset of youths during the COVID-19 quarantine and the immediate pre–COVID-19 period. RESULTS: Although there was a difference in the absolute number of in-person versus telehealth visits canceled during these two time periods, there was no difference in the rates of completed, canceled, and no-show visits completed in person or via telehealth. This finding suggests that, despite a rapid shift to a completely new health care delivery model, our providers completed a similar rate of patient care via telehealth during the COVID-19 quarantine and that telehealth may be a feasible method for providing diabetes care. However, our results also suggested that youths’ glucose management was less optimal during the quarantine period. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 presented an opportunity to adopt and test the feasibility of using a telehealth delivery model for routine diabetes care. Yet, to make telehealth a viable treatment delivery alternative will likely involve the uptake of new clinic procedures, investment in institutional infrastructure, and team-based flexibility.","Pierce, Jessica S.; Gurnurkar, Shilpa; Vyas, Neha; Carakushansky, Mauri; Owens, Lindsay; Patton, Susana R.",Diabetes Spectr,565,26

The first COVID-19 national lockdown led to an increasing reliance on home-carers and we investigate the short- and longer-term impacts of lockdown on their mental health. METHODS: Data from 9737 adult participants (aged 16+) from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (Understanding Society) were used to explore changes in 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) score between (a) pre-pandemic (2019) and early lockdowns (April 2020) and (b) early and later (July 2020) lockdowns. RESULTS: GHQ-12 scores among home-carers were higher pre-lockdown and increased more than for non-carers from 2019 to April 2020 with further increases for home-carers compared with non-carers between April and July. Compared with respondents caring for a spouse/partner, those caring for a child under 18 had a particularly marked increase in GHQ-12 score between 2019 and April, as did those caring for someone with a learning disability. Home-carers of children under 18 improved from April to July while those caring for adult children saw a marked worsening of their mental health. Home-carers with greater care burden saw larger increases in GHQ-12 score from 2019 to April and from April to July, and increases through both periods were greater for home-carers who had formal help prior to lockdown but then lost it.

We aimed to explore the association of hypolipidemia with patient outcomes in terms of immunothrombosis and multiorgan injury, focusing on specialized apolipoproteins apo A1 and apo B. METHODS: Lipid profiles of 50 COVID-19 patients and 30 sick controls presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) were measured in this prospective observational study. The primary outcome was development of severe acute kidney injury (AKI). Need for hospitalization and ICU admission were secondary outcomes. Lipoproteins were analyzed for independent association with serum creatinine (SCr) increase ratio and correlated with a wide panel of biomarkers. RESULTS: COVID-19 cohort had significantly lower apo A1 (p = 0.006), and higher apo B/apo A1 ratio (p = 0.041). Patients developing severe AKI had significantly lower LDL-C (p = 0.021). Apo B/apo A1 was associated with 2.25-fold decrease in serum SCr increase ratio, while LDL-C with a 1.5% decrease. Hypolipidemia correlated with low plasminogen, ADAMTS13 activity/VWF:Ag, and high inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), ED creatinine, and SCr increase ratio. CONCLUSION: Although favored in dietetics, findings of a low LDL-C in COVID-19 patients should be alarming in light of our observations. Low apo B/apo A1 ratio and LDL-C are predictive of renal deterioration in COVID-19 patients, and low LDL-C in particular may potentially serve to indicate COVID-19 related AKI driven by disrupted fibrinolysis and a secondary thrombotic microangiopathy-like process.","Henry, Brandon M.; Szergyuk, Ivan; de Oliveira, Maria Helena Santos; Abosamak, Mohammed Fawzi; Benoit, Stefanie W.; Benoit, Justin L.; Lippi, Giuseppe",Diabetes Metab Syndr,565,0

Based on the previous mindfulness-based interventions proved to be effective, this protocol reports a design of a randomized controlled trial aiming to explore the efficacy and possible mechanism of a mindful living with challenge (MLWC) intervention developed for COVID-19 survivors in alleviating their psychological problems caused by both the disease and the pandemic. METHODS: In April 2021, more than 1600 eligible participants from Hubei Province of China will be assigned 1:1 to an online MLWC intervention group or a waitlist control group. All participants will be asked to complete online questionnaires at baseline, post-program, and 3-month follow-up. The differences of mental health status (e.g. PTSD) and physical symptoms including fatigue and sleeplessness between the COVID-19 survivors who receiving the online MLWC intervention and the control group will be assessed. In addition, the possible mediators and moderators of the link between the MLWC intervention and target outcomes will be evaluated by related verified scales, such as the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire. Data will be analyzed based on an intention-to-treat approach, and SPSS software will be used to perform statistical analysis. DISCUSSION: The efficacy and potential mechanism of MLWC intervention in improving the quality of life and psychological status of COVID-19 survivors in China are expected to be reported. Findings from this study will shed light on a novel and feasible model in improving the psychological well-being of people during such public health emergencies.

In addition to histones, some HDACs also deacetylate transcription factors and specific cytoplasmic proteins.Monocytes, as part of the innate immune system, maintain tissue homeostasis and help fight infections and cancer. In these cells, HDACs are involved in multiple processes including proliferation, migration, differentiation, inflammatory response, infections, and tumorigenesis. Here, a systematic description of the role that most HDACs play in these functions is reviewed. Specifically, some HDACs induce a pro-inflammatory response and play major roles in host defense. Conversely, other HDACs reprogram monocytes and macrophages towards an immunosuppressive phenotype. The right balance between both types helps monocytes to respond correctly to the different physiological/pathological stimuli. However, aberrant expressions or activities of specific HDACs are associated with autoimmune diseases along with other chronic inflammatory diseases, infections, or cancer.This paper critically reviews the interesting and extensive knowledge regarding the role of some HDACs in these pathologies. It also shows that as yet, very little progress has been made toward the goal of finding effective HDAC-targeted therapies. However, given their obvious potential, we conclude that it is worth the effort to develop monocyte-specific drugs that selectively target HDAC subtypes with the aim of finding effective treatments for diseases in which our innate immune system is involved.","Tordera, Rosa María; Cortés-Erice, María","Reviews of physiology, biochemistry and pharmacology",565,20

Differentially Expressed Genes were identified. Gene ontology and pathways were functionally enriched, and networking was constructed in NetworkAnalyst. Lastly, the correlation between post‐BCG vaccination and COVID‐19 transcriptome signatures was established. A total of 161 DEGs (113 upregulated DEGs and 48 downregulated genes) were identified in the SARS‐CoV‐2 group. In the pathway enrichment analysis, a cross‐reference of upregulated Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways in SARS‐CoV‐2 with downregulated counterparts in the BCG‐vaccinated group, resulted in the intersection of 45 common pathways, accounting for 86.5% of SARS‐CoV‐2 upregulated pathways. Of these intersecting pathways, a vast majority were immune and inflammatory pathways with top significance in interleukin‐17, tumor necrosis factor, NOD‐like receptors, and nuclear factor‐κB signaling pathways. Given the inverse relationship of the specific differentially expressed gene pathways highlighted in our results, the BCG‐vaccine may play a protective role against COVID‐19 by mounting a nonspecific immunological response and further investigation of this relationship is warranted.","Toraih, Eman A.; Sedhom, Jessica A.; Dokunmu, Titilope M.; Hussein, Mohammad H.; Ruiz, Emmanuelle M.

Nucleic acids, which are critical components for inheriting genetic information in all species including pathogens, are key structures sensed by the innate immune system. The corresponding receptors for foreign nucleic acids include members of Toll‐like receptors, RIG‐I‐like receptors, and intracellular DNA sensors. While nucleic acid recognition by these receptors is required for host defense against the pathogen, there is a potential risk to the host of self‐nucleic acids recognition, thus precipitating autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. In this review, we discuss the roles of nucleic acid‐sensing receptors in guarding against pathogen invasion, discriminating between self and non‐self, and contributing to autoimmunity and autoinflammatory diseases.","Kawasaki, Takumi; Kawai, Taro; Akira, Shizuo",Immunol Rev,565,28

Bacilli dissemination is due to poor antioxidant defense mechanisms and intensified oxidative stress. There are few recent studies that analyzed and compared free radicals or antioxidant status before and after anti-TB treatment. Hence, the present study underlines the need to identify oxidative stress as it could be a useful tool in TB monitorisation. Thirty newly diagnosed patients with pulmonary TB were included after signing an informed consent. Blood was collected before receiving first-line anti-tubercular therapy (T0) and after 60 days (T2). Spectrophotometric methods were used to quantify oxidative parameters (TBARS—thiobarbituric acid reactive species); enzymatic antioxidants such as SOD (superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase), GPx (glutathione peroxidase), and TAC (total antioxidant capacity); and non-enzymatic antioxidants such as GSH (reduced glutathione). A moderate positive correlation was found between GSH and TAC (r = 0.63, p-value = 0.046) and GSH and SOD (r = 0.64, p-value = 0.041) at T2. Increased values of GSH, CAT, and SOD were noted at T2 in comparison with T0, while GPx, TAC, and TBARS decreased at T2. A better monitorisation in TB could be based on oxidative stress and antioxidant status.

Given wide disparities in the pandemic's impact across communities, neighborhood deprivation may explain observed variation in the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and preterm delivery. Objective To characterize changes in the incidence of PTD during the COVID-19 pandemic with attention to effect modification introduced by neighborhood hardship. Study Design This retrospective cohort study included all pregnant patients who delivered at an urban tertiary care hospital during the pandemic (April-November 2020) or pre-pandemic (April-November 2019). We compared the incidence of PTD, spontaneous PTD, and medically indicated PTD prior to 37 weeks’ gestation across epochs. Planned analyses stratified the cohorts by neighborhood deprivation metrics defined by residential zip code, including median neighborhood household income and hardship index (a composite index including dependency, educational attainment, unemployment, poverty, per capita income, and crowded housing). The Breslow-Day test for homogeneity assessed the association of delivery epoch and neighborhood deprivation with PTD outcome. Results Of 16,544 eligible deliveries, 8.7% occurred preterm. Incidences of PTD (8.4% vs. 9.0%, p=0.17), spontaneous PTD (5.0 vs 5.4%, p=0.27), and medically indicated PTD (3.2% v 3.5%, p=0.47) were similar between the pandemic and pre-pandemic epochs. However, PTD (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.96) and spontaneous PTD (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.99) decreased from the pre-pandemic to pandemic epoch in those living in neighborhoods <50th percentile for median income (Breslow-Day p-values 0.047 and 0.036, respectively). Similarly, PTD (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.97) and spontaneous PTD (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.98) decreased for those inhabiting neighborhoods in the highest-hardship quartile (Breslow-Day p-values 0.045 and 0.029, respectively). Conclusion Populations residing in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods experienced reductions in preterm delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Neighborhood-level social determinants of health offer insight into the complex etiologies that contribute to preterm delivery, and provide opportunities for public health, equity-focused prevention strategies.","FISHER, Stephanie A.; SAKOWICZ, Allie; BARNARD, Cynthia; KIDDER, Seth; MILLER, Emily S.",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,565,24

We aimed to explore safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine in people with HIV. METHODS: In this single-arm open-label vaccination substudy within the protocol of the larger phase 2/3 trial COV002, adults aged 18–55 years with HIV were enrolled at two HIV clinics in London, UK. Eligible participants were required to be on antiretroviral therapy (ART), with undetectable plasma HIV viral loads (<50 copies per mL), and CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per μL. A prime-boost regimen of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, with two doses was given 4–6 weeks apart. The primary outcomes for this substudy were safety and reactogenicity of the vaccine, as determined by serious adverse events and solicited local and systemic reactions. Humoral responses were measured by anti-spike IgG ELISA and antibody-mediated live virus neutralisation. Cell-mediated immune responses were measured by ex-vivo IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISpot) and T-cell proliferation. All outcomes were compared with an HIV-uninfected group from the main COV002 study within the same age group and dosing strategy and are reported until day 56 after prime vaccination. Outcomes were analysed in all participants who received both doses and with available samples. The COV002 study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04400838, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Nov 5 and Nov 24, 2020, 54 participants with HIV (all male, median age 42·5 years [IQR 37·2–49·8]) were enrolled and received two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Median CD4 count at enrolment was 694·0 cells per μL (IQR 573·5–859·5). No serious adverse events occurred. Local and systemic reactions occurring during the first 7 days after prime vaccination included pain at the injection site (26 [49%] of 53 participants with available data), fatigue (25 [47%]), headache (25 [47%]), malaise (18 [34%]), chills (12 [23%]), muscle ache (19 [36%]), joint pain (five [9%]), and nausea (four [8%]), the frequencies of which were similar to the HIV-negative participants. Anti-spike IgG responses by ELISA peaked at day 42 (median 1440 ELISA units [EUs; IQR 704–2728]; n=50) and were sustained until day 56 (median 941 EUs [531–1445]; n=49). We found no correlation between the magnitude of the anti-spike IgG response at day 56 and CD4 cell count (p=0·93) or age (p=0·48). ELISpot and T-cell proliferative responses peaked at day 14 and 28 after prime dose and were sustained to day 56. Compared with participants without HIV, we found no difference in magnitude or persistence of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific humoral or cellular responses (p>0·05 for all analyses). INTERPRETATION: In this study of people with HIV, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was safe and immunogenic, supporting vaccination for those well controlled on ART.

Rapid detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and variant strains is paramount for recovery from this pandemic. Conventional SARS-CoV-2 tests interrogate only limited regions of the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome, which are subjected to low specificity and miss the opportunity of detecting variant strains. In this work, we developed the first SARS-CoV-2 tiling array that captures the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome at single nucleotide resolution and offers the opportunity to detect point mutations. A thorough bioinformatics protocol of two base calling methods has been developed to accompany this array. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the tiling array, we genotyped all genomic positions of eight SARS-CoV-2 samples. Using high-throughput sequencing as the benchmark, we show that the tiling array had a genome-wide accuracy of at least 99.5%. From the tiling array analysis results, we identified the D614G mutation in the spike protein in four of the eight samples, suggesting the widespread distribution of this variant at the early stage of the outbreak in the United States. Two additional nonsynonymous mutations were identified in one sample in the nucleocapsid protein (P13L and S197L), which may complicate future vaccine development. With around $5 per array, supreme accuracy, and an ultrafast bioinformatics protocol, the SARS-CoV-2 tiling array makes an invaluable toolkit for combating current and future pandemics. Our SARS-CoV-2 tilting array is currently utilized by Molecular Vision, a CLIA-certified lab for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.","Jiang, Limin; Guo, Yan; Yu, Hui; Hoff, Kendal; Ding, Xun; Zhou, Wei; Edwards, Jeremy",Brief Bioinform,565,10

In dromedary camels, the virus only causes a mild infection but it spreads efficiently between animals. Differences in the behavior of the virus observed between individuals, as well as between humans and dromedary camels, highlight the role of host factors in MERS-CoV pathogenesis and transmission. One of these host factors, the MERS-CoV receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), may be a critical determinant because it is variably expressed in MERS-CoV-susceptible species as well as in humans. This could partially explain inter- and intraspecies differences in the tropism, pathogenesis, and transmissibility of MERS-CoV. In this review, we explore the role of DPP4 and other host factors in MERS-CoV transmission and pathogenesis—such as sialic acids, host proteases, and interferons. Further characterization of these host determinants may potentially offer novel insights to develop intervention strategies to tackle ongoing outbreaks.","Widagdo, W.; Sooksawasdi Na Ayudhya, Syriam; Hundie, Gadissa B.; Haagmans, Bart L.",Viruses,565,5

Clinical quality assurance (QA) practices used to detect underreporting rely on on-site audits; however, adverse events (AEs) underreporting remains a recurrent issue. In a recent project, we developed a predictive model that enables oversight of AE reporting for clinical quality program leads (QPLs). However, there were limitations to using solely a machine learning model. OBJECTIVE: Our primary objective was to propose a robust method to compute the probability of AE underreporting that could complement our machine learning model. Our model was developed to enhance patients’ safety while reducing the need for on-site and manual QA activities in clinical trials. METHODS: We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the site reporting rates and assess the risk of underreporting. We designed the model with Project Data Sphere clinical trial data that are public and anonymized. RESULTS: We built a model that infers the site reporting behavior from patient-level observations and compares them across a study to enable a robust detection of outliers between clinical sites. CONCLUSION: The new model will be integrated into the current dashboard designed for clinical QPLs. This approach reduces the need for on-site audits, shifting focus from source data verification to pre-identified, higher risk areas. It will enhance further QA activities for safety reporting from clinical trials and generate quality evidence during pre-approval inspections.

However, only in Guatemala, Trinidad and Tobago, and Mexico have found antibodies in VEEV in bats, using immunohistochemistry, the sensitivity and specificity are improved; thus, it is better for demonstrating natural infection in bats as potential hosts. This study aimed to determine the presence of VEEV in tissues of frugivorous bats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective descriptive cross-sectional study with a non-probabilistic sampling was carried out in 12 localities of Córdoba and Sucre area of the Colombian Caribbean. Two hundred and eighty-six bats were captured using fog nets, and the specimens according to taxonomic keys were classified. According to the Ethics Committee of the University of Córdoba, the bats were treated with analgesics and anesthetics. Blood samples were taken and then euthanized to obtain tissues and organs which were preserved in liquid N2 at −196°C. A portion of each organ was fixed in 10% buffered formalin for the detection of antigens by immunohistochemistry. Several pathological anatomy analyses were performed to determine the histological characteristics of tissue lesions of frugivorous bats naturally infected with the VEEV. RESULTS: Of the 286 bats captured, 23 species were identified. In samples of the brain, spleen, and lung of two frugivorous bats (2/286=0.70%) Artibeus planirostris and Sturnira lilium, the presence of VEEV was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: A fragment of the nsP4 non-structural protein gene corresponding to the alphavirus was amplified. Two samples were positive (2/286=0.70%) in frugivorous bats; A. planirostris (code GenBank: MG820274) and S. lilium (code GenBank: MG820275).

We investigated two soluble markers of monocyte activation, sCD14 and sCD163, in covid19 patients with the aim of characterizing their potential role in monocyte-macrophage disease immunopathology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind. Methods. Fifty-nine SARS-Cov-2 positive hospitalized patients, classified according to ICU or non-ICU admission requirement, were prospectively recruited and analyzed by ELISA for levels of sCD14 and sCD163, along with other laboratory parameters, and compared to a healthy control group. Results. sCD14 and sCD163 levels were significantly higher among COVID-19 patients, independently of ICU admission requirement, compared to the control group. We found a significant correlation between sCD14 levels and other inflammatory markers, particularly Interleukin-6, in the non-ICU patients group. sCD163 showed a moderate positive correlation with the time at sampling from admission, increasing its value over time, independently of severity group. Conclusions. Monocyte-macrophage activation markers are increased and correlate with other inflammatory markers in SARS-Cov-2 infection, in association to hospital admission.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused surgeons the world over to re-evaluate their approach to surgical procedures given concerns over the risk of aerosolization of viral particles and exposure of operating room staff to infection. International society guidelines advise against the use of laparoscopy; however, the evidence on this topic is scant and recommendations are based on the perceived most cautious course of action. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of the existing literature surrounding the risks of viral transmission during laparoscopic surgery and balance these risks against the benefits of minimally invasive approaches. We also propose mitigation measures to address these risks that we have adopted in our institution. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: While it is currently assumed that open surgery minimizes operating room staff exposure to the virus, our findings reveal that this may not be the case. A well-informed, evidence-based opinion is critical when making decisions regarding which operative approach to pursue, for the safety and well-being of the patient, the operating room staff, and the healthcare system at large. Minimally invasive surgical approaches offer significant advantages with respect to both patient care, and the mitigation of the risk of viral transmission during surgery, provided the appropriate equipment and expertise are present.","Chadi, Sami A.; Guidolin, Keegan; Caycedo-Marulanda, Antonio; Sharkawy, Abdu; Spinelli, Antonino; Quereshy, Fayez A.; Okrainec, Allan",Ann Surg,565,20

Clinical evidences demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection produces detrimental levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and significant systemic organ damage. Currently, there is no definitive therapy for COVID-19 or associated complications, and with the hope of a safe and effective vaccine in the distant future, the search for an answer is paramount. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) provide a viable option due to their immunomodulatory effects and tissue repair and regeneration abilities. Studies have demonstrated that compassionate use of MSCs can reduce symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, eliminate fluid buildup, and act as a regenerative technique for alveolar damage; all in a safe and effective way. With multiple autologous sources available for MSCs, each with their own respective limitations, allogenic umbilical cord (UC) and/or UC-derived Wharton’s jelly (WJ) seem to be best positioned source to harvest MSCs to treat COVID-19 and associated symptoms. As an allogenic source, UC is readily available, easily obtainable, and is rich in immunomodulatory and regenerative factors. In this manuscript, we reviewed the current evidences and explored the potential therapeutic use of allogenic UC and/or WJ-derived MSCs for the treatment of COVID-19. Although, preliminary preclinical and clinical studies indicate that their use is safe and potentially effective, more multi-center, randomized, controlled trials are needed to adequately assess the safety and efficacy of UC and/or WJ-derived MSCs for the treatment of COVID-19.","Rodriguez, Hugo C.; Gupta, Manu; Cavazos-Escobar, Emilio; El-Amin, Saadiq F.; Gupta, Ashim",Hum Cell,565,1

In 2019, globally, an estimated 10.0 million people fell ill and about 1.4 million died of TB. During the same year, South Africa was among the eight countries with the highest tuberculosis burden, contributing to two-thirds of the world’s total. Due to the high burden of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic, TB in South Africa is a major public health problem. Limpopo is amongst the provinces that are hardest hit by TB and HIV in South Africa. Therefore, using a quantitative descriptive design, this study assessed the knowledge, beliefs, and perceptions of TB and TB treatment amongst TB patients in the Limpopo Province. A systematic random sampling method was used to sample 207 TB patients who agreed in writing to be part of the study. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire, however, about 3.9% of participants who could not read were assisted by the main researcher and health professional.

Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences(®) version 26.0. Validity and reliability of the instrument was ensured, and ethical considerations were observed in this study. The research findings revealed that about 93.25% respondents only came to know they had TB after diagnosis. About 75% indicated that they had visited faith healers and only 2% acknowledged that they had visited traditional healers after diagnosis. A total of 76% of the respondents stated that they strongly believed in their culture and religion. These findings highlight the need for health education efforts to strengthen accurate information to improve TB knowledge and correct misconceptions about TB among patients within the community.","Matakanye, Hulisani; Tshitangano, Takalani Grace; Mabunda, Jabu Tsakani; Maluleke, Thelmah Xavela",Int J Environ Res Public Health,565,10

Endogenous viral elements in host genomes provide separate evidence that viruses similar to many major contemporary groups circulated 100 million years ago or earlier. In this Opinion article, we argue that the extraordinary conservation of virus genome sequences is best explained by a niche-filling model in which fitness optimization is rapidly achieved in their specific hosts. Whereas short-term substitution rates reflect the accumulation of tolerated sequence changes within adapted genomes, longer-term rates increasingly resemble those of their hosts as the evolving niche moulds and effectively imprisons the virus in co-adapted virus–host relationships. Contrastingly, viruses that jump hosts undergo strong and stringent adaptive selection as they maximize their fit to their new niche. This adaptive capability may paradoxically create evolutionary stasis in long-term host relationships. While viruses can evolve and adapt rapidly, their hosts may ultimately shape their longer-term evolution.","Simmonds, Peter; Aiewsakun, Pakorn; Katzourakis, Aris",Nat Rev Microbiol,565,20

After adjusting for patient and visit characteristics and in comparison with pre-COVID in-person visits, during video and telephone visits, clinicians had lower odds of ordering any medication (COVID-era in-person: odds ratio [OR], 0.62 [95% CI, 0.60-0.64], COVID-era video: OR, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.20-0.24]; COVID-era telephone: OR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.13-0.15]) or tests, such as electrocardiograms (COVID-era in-person: OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.58-0.62]; COVID-era video: OR, 0.03 [95% CI, 0.02-0.04]; COVID-era telephone: OR, 0.02 [95% CI, 0.01-0.03]) or echocardiograms (COVID-era in-person: OR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.18-1.24]; COVID-era video: OR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.42-0.52]; COVID-era telephone: OR, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.25-0.31]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients who were Asian, Black, or Hispanic, had private insurance, and had at least one of several cardiovascular comorbidities used remote cardiovascular care more frequently in the COVID-era period. Clinician ordering of diagnostic testing and medications consistently decreased when comparing pre-COVID vs COVID-era and in-person vs remote visits. Further studies are needed to clarify whether these decreases represent a reduction in the overuse of tests and medications vs an underuse of indicated testing and prescribing.","Yuan, Neal; Pevnick, Joshua M.; Botting, Patrick G.; Elad, Yaron; Miller, Shaun J.; Cheng, Susan; Ebinger, Joseph E.",JAMA Netw Open,565,20

The response of the scientific community was unparalleled, and a combined global effort has resulted in the creation of vaccines in a shorter time frame than previously unimaginable. Reflecting this concerted effort, the structural analysis of the etiological agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has progressed with an unprecedented pace. Since the onset of the pandemic, over 1,000 high-resolution structures of a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been solved and made publicly available. These structures have aided in the identification of numerous potential druggable targets and have contributed to the design of different vaccine candidates.

This situation may have an impact on mental health, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption. The aim of this research report is therefore to describe changes in tobacco and alcohol consumption in the general French population during the first two weeks of lockdown and identify any associated factors. METHODS: Self-reported changes in smoking and alcohol consumption following the lockdown implemented in France on March 17, 2020 were collected from 2,003 respondents aged 18 years and older in an online cross-sectional survey carried out from March 30 to April 1, 2020. Anxiety and depression levels were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: Among current smokers, 26.7% reported an increase in their tobacco consumption since lockdown and 18.6% reported a decrease, while it remained stable for 54.7%. The increase in tobacco consumption was associated with an age of 18-34 years, a high level of education, and anxiety. Among alcohol drinkers, 10.7% reported an increase in their alcohol consumption since lockdown and 24.4% reported a decrease, while it remained stable for 64.8%. The increase in alcohol consumption was associated with an age of 18-49 years, living in cities of more than 100,000 inhabitants, a high socio-professional category, and a depressive mood. CONCLUSION: The national lockdown implemented in France during the COVID-19 pandemic influenced tobacco and alcohol consumption in different ways according to sociodemographic group and mental health.","Guignard, Romain; Andler, Raphaël; Quatremère, Guillemette; Pasquereau, Anne; du Roscoät, Enguerrand; Arwidson, Pierre; Berlin, Ivan; Nguyen-Thanh, Viêt",Eur J Public Health,565,19

Many countries have implemented border restriction as a public health measure to limit local outbreak. However, there is inadequate scientific data to support such a practice, especially in the presence of an established local transmission of the disease. Method: A novel metapopulation Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model with inspected migration was applied to investigate the effect of border restriction between Hong Kong and mainland China on the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Isolation facilities occupancy was also studied. Results: At R0 of 2.2, the cumulative COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong can be reduced by 13.99% (from 29,163 to 25,084) with complete border closure. At an in-patient mortality of 1.4%, the number of deaths can be reduced from 408 to 351 (57 lives saved). However, border closure alone was insufficient to prevent full occupancy of isolation facilities in Hong Kong; effective public health measures to reduce local R0 to below 1.6 was necessary. Conclusion: As a public health measure to tackle COVID-19, border restriction is effective in reducing cumulative cases and mortality.","Kwok, W. C.; Wong, C. K.; Ma, T. F.; Ho, K. W.; Fan, W. T.

684709,684709,684709,Electrocardiographic manifestations of COVID-19,18.84226,7.718403,2020-12-29,"BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) is the most widely used health care–associated infection (HAI) and antimicrobial use and resistance surveillance program in the United States. Over 37,000 health care facilities participate in the program and submit a large volume of surveillance data. These data are used by the facilities themselves, the CDC, and other agencies and organizations for a variety of purposes, including infection prevention, antimicrobial stewardship, and clinical quality measurement. Among the summary metrics made available by the NHSN are standardized infection ratios, which are used to identify HAI prevention needs and measure progress at the national, regional, state, and local levels. OBJECTIVE: To extend the use of geospatial methods and tools to NHSN data, and in turn to promote and inspire new uses of the rendered data for analysis and prevention purposes, we developed a web-enabled system that enables integrated visualization of HAI metrics and supporting data. METHODS: We leveraged geocoding and visualization technologies that are readily available and in current use to develop a web-enabled system designed to support visualization and interpretation of data submitted to the NHSN from geographically dispersed sites. The server–client model–based system enables users to access the application via a web browser. RESULTS: We integrated multiple data sets into a single-page dashboard designed to enable users to navigate across different HAI event types, choose specific health care facility or geographic locations for data displays, and scale across time units within identified periods. We launched the system for internal CDC use in January 2019. CONCLUSIONS: CDC NHSN statisticians, data analysts, and subject matter experts identified opportunities to extend the use of geospatial methods and tools to NHSN data and provided the impetus to develop NHSNViz. The development effort proceeded iteratively, with the developer adding or enhancing functionality and including additional data sets in a series of prototype versions, each of which incorporated user feedback. The initial production version of NHSNViz provides a new geospatial analytic resource built in accordance with CDC user requirements and extensible to additional users and uses in subsequent versions.","Zheng, Shuai; Edwards, Jonathan R; Dudeck, Margaret A; Patel, Prachi R; Wattenmaker, Lauren; Mirza, Muzna; Tejedor, Sheri Chernetsky; Lemoine, Kent; Benin, Andrea L; Pollock, Daniel A",JMIR Public Health Surveill,565,1

Rapid and accurate diagnostic tests are imperative for identifying and managing infected individuals, contact tracing, epidemiologic characterization, and public health decision making. Laboratory testing may be performed based on symptomatic presentation or for screening of asymptomatic people. Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is typically by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), which requires specialized equipment and training and may be particularly challenging in resource-limited settings. NAAT may give false-negative results due to timing of sample collection relative to infection, improper sampling of respiratory specimens, inadequate preservation of samples, and technical limitations; false-positives may occur due to technical errors, particularly contamination during the manual real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) process. Thus, clinical presentation, contact history and contemporary phyloepidemiology must be considered when interpreting results. Several sample-to-answer platforms, including high-throughput systems and Point of Care (PoC) assays, have been developed to increase testing capacity and decrease technical errors. Alternatives to RT-PCR assay, such as other RNA detection methods and antigen tests may be appropriate for certain situations, such as resource-limited settings. While sequencing is important to monitor on-going evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, antibody assays are useful for epidemiologic purposes. The ever-expanding assortment of tests, with varying clinical utility, performance requirements, and limitations, merits comparative evaluation. We herein provide a comprehensive review of currently available COVID-19 diagnostics, exploring their pros and cons as well as appropriate indications. Strategies to further optimize safety, speed, and ease of SARS-CoV-2 testing without compromising accuracy are suggested. Access to scalable diagnostic tools and continued technologic advances, including machine learning and smartphone integration, will facilitate control of the current pandemic as well as preparedness for the next one.","Mardian, Yan; Kosasih, Herman; Karyana, Muhammad; Neal, Aaron; Lau, Chuen-Yen",Front Med (Lausanne),565,6

The role of melatonin in pregnancy is emerging. The enzymes needed for endogenous synthesis of melatonin have been identified in the placenta, although the contribution to circulating maternal melatonin in normal pregnancy is unclear. This work aimed to determine serum levels of melatonin and its major metabolite 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate (6-OHMS) in normal pregnant women during each trimester of pregnancy, and immediately after delivery. Blood samples were obtained from a cohort of healthy pregnant women during each trimester of pregnancy (n = 26), from women scheduled for elective Cesarean section (CS) before and after delivery (n = 15), along with placental samples, and from healthy non-pregnant women as controls (n = 30). Melatonin and its major metabolite, 6-OHMS, were measured using enzyme immunoassay. Levels of serum melatonin were significantly higher during pregnancy than in non-pregnant women (P = 0.025) and increased throughout pregnancy (P < 0.0001). In women undergoing CS, serum melatonin decreased markedly 24 h after delivery (P = 0.0013). Similar results were seen for serum levels of 6-OHMS, and placental tissue 6-OHMS levels correlated with week of gestation at delivery (p = 0.018). In summary, maternal melatonin production is higher in pregnant than in non-pregnant women, increases significantly during pregnancy with highest levels in the third trimester, and decreases abruptly after delivery. These results suggest that the placenta is a major source of melatonin and supports a physiological role for melatonin in pregnancy.","Ejaz, Haroon; Figaro, Juliana K.; Woolner, Andrea M.

The drought’s natural instigator was the El Niño phase of the El Niño Southern Oscillation, a climatic phenomenon then not understood by contemporary observers. The 1877 event has been explored in some depth for countries including India, China and Australia. Its impact on Southeast Asia however is less well-known and the story of how the event unfolded in Singapore and Malaysia has not been told. This paper explores how the contemporary British government responded to the drought, arguing that its impact on hydraulic management was at best minimal yet, it did have impact on other areas, such as forest reservation with the hope of preserving future rainfall. It also highlights how, in contrast to studies on urban water plans in other British Asian colonies, the colonial authorities in the Straits Settlements had a far less coherent and meaningful relationship with water in their town planning schemes.

Identifying potential prognostic factors upon admission could help identify patients with a poor prognosis. Methods: We aimed to explore the characteristics and evolution of COVID-19 cancer patients admitted to hospital in a multicenter international registry (HOPE COVID-19). Our primary objective: is to define those characteristics that allow us to identify cancer patients with a worse prognosis (mortality within 30 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19). Results: 5838 patients have been collected in this registry, of whom 770 had cancer among their antecedents. In hospital mortality reached 258 patients (33.51%). The median was 75 years (65-82). Regarding the distribution by sex, 34.55% of the patients (266/770) were women.The distribution by type of cancer: genitourinary 238/745 (31.95%), digestive 124/745 (16.54%), hematologic 95/745 (12.75%).In multivariate regression analysis, factors that are independently associated with mortality at admission are: renal impairment (OR 3.45, CI 97.5% 1.85-6.58), heart disease (2.32, 1.47-3.66), liver disease (4.69, 1.94-11.62), partial dependence (2.41, 1.34-4.33), total dependence (7.21, 2.60-21.82), fatigue (1.84, 1.16-2.93), arthromialgias (0.45, 0.26-0.78), SatO2<92% (4.58, 2.97-7.17), elevated LDH (2.61, 1.51-4.69) and abnormal decreased Blood Pressure (3.57, 1.81-7.15).

Countries have adopted non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) to slow down the spread. This study proposes an agent-based model that simulates the spread of COVID-19 among the inhabitants of a city. The agent-based model can be accommodated for any location by integrating parameters specific to the city. The simulation gives the number of total COVID-19 cases. Considering each person as an agent susceptible to COVID-19, the model causes infected individuals to transmit the disease via various actions performed every hour. The model is validated by comparing the simulation to the real data of Ford County, KS, USA. Different interventions, including contact tracing, are applied on a scaled-down version of New York City, USA, and the parameters that lead to a controlled epidemic are determined. Our experiments suggest that contact tracing via smartphones with more than 60% of the population owning a smartphone combined with city-wide lockdown results in the effective reproduction number (R(t)) to fall below 1 within 3 weeks of intervention. For 75% or more smartphone users, new infections are eliminated, and the spread is contained within 3 months of intervention. Contact tracing accompanied with early lockdown can suppress the epidemic growth of COVID-19 completely with sufficient smartphone owners. In places where it is difficult to ensure a high percentage of smartphone ownership, tracing only emergency service providers during a lockdown can go a long way to contain the spread.
