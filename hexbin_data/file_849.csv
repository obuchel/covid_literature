Although bulk single-crystalline perovskite-based materials are well-recognized for the high photoelectric conversion efficiency than the polycrystalline ones, their stiff and brittle nature unfortunately prohibits their application for flexible devices. Here, we introduce ultrathin single-crystalline perovskite film as the active layer and demonstrate a high-performance flexible photodetector with prevailing bending reliability. With a much-reduced thickness of 20 nm, the photodetector made of this ultrathin film can achieve a significantly increased responsivity as 5600A/W, 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of recently reported flexible perovskite photodetectors. The demonstrated 0.2 MHz 3 dB bandwidth further paves the way for high-speed photodetection. Notably, all its optoelectronic characteristics resume after being bent over thousands of times. These results manifest the great potential of single-crystalline perovskite ultrathin films for developing wearable and flexible optoelectronic devices.","Jing, Hao; Peng, Ruwen; Ma, Ren-Min; He, Jie; Zhou, Yi; Yang, Zhenqian; Li, Cheng-Yao; Liu, Yu; Guo, Xiaojiao; Zhu, Yingying; Wang, Di; Su, Jing; Sun, Cheng; Bao, Wenzhong; Wang, Mu",Nano letters,849,19

A prospectively collected database of operative times and costs was analysed for the years 2008-2011. SILS cases were compared to standard laparoscopy on a procedure-matched basis. Patient demographics, on-table time and consumable costs were collated. Descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney U-test were utilized with SPSS for windows. Analysis of the data demonstrate that neither consumable costs nor operative time were significantly different in each group. Comparing operative costs, SILS appendicectomy, nephrectomy/heminephrectomy, and ovarian cystectomy/oophorectomy showed cost benefit over SLS (£397 versus £467; £942 versus £1127; £394 versus £495). A trend toward higher cost for SILS Palomo procedure is noted (£734 versus £400). Operative time for SILS appendicectomy, nephrectomy/heminephrectomy, and Palomo was lower compared to SLS (60 versus 103 minutes[mins.]; 130 versus 60 mins.; 60 versus 80 mins.). In conclusion, SILS appears to be cost-effective for the common pediatric surgical operations. There is no significant difference in operating time in this series, but small sample size is a limiting factor. Studies with larger numbers will be necessary to validate these initial observations.","Islam, Saidul; Adams, Stephen D; Mahomed, Anies A",Minimally invasive surgery,849,30

Cosmetic outcomes were compared between skin incisions created with cutting diathermy versus scalpel. Wound infection rates and postoperative incisional pain were also compared. METHODS This was a randomized double-blind trial comparing cutting diathermy and scalpel in patients undergoing bowel resection. Scar cosmesis was assessed at 6 months after surgery by a plastic surgeon and a research associate using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) and the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). Patients also used POSAS to self-evaluate their scars. Wound infections within 30 days were recorded, and incision pain scores were measured on the first 5 days after operation. RESULTS A total of 66 patients were randomized to cutting diathermy (31) or scalpel (35). At 6 months, there was no significant difference between the diathermy and scalpel groups in mean(s.d.) VSS scores (4·9(2·6) versus 5·0(1·9); P = 0·837), mean POSAS total scores (19·2(8·0) versus 20·0(7·4); P = 0·684) or subjective POSAS total scores (20·2(12·1) versus 21·3(10·4); P = 0·725). Neither were there significant differences in wound infection rates between the groups (5 of 30 versus 5 of 32; P = 1·000). Pain scores on day 1 after operation were significantly lower in the diathermy group (mean 1·68 versus 3·13; P = 0·018), but were not significantly different on days 2-5. CONCLUSION Cutting diathermy is a cosmetically acceptable technique for abdominal skin incisions. There is no increased risk of wound infection, and diathermy may convey benefit in terms of early postoperative wound pain.

By August 2020, there were almost 20 million confirmed cases worldwide and well over half-million deaths. Since there is still no effective treatment or vaccine, non-pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented in an attempt to contain the spread of the virus. During times of quarantine, immunization practices in all age groups, especially routine childhood vaccines, have also been interrupted, delayed, re-organized, or completely suspended. Numerous high-income as well as low- and middle-income countries are now experiencing a rapid decline in childhood immunization coverage rates. We will, inevitably, see serious consequences related to suboptimal control of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) in children concurrent with or following the pandemic.

Vitamin D has known to be important in infectious pathologies. However, there are conflicting results in the role of vitamin D in COPD exacerbation. This study was design to evaluate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among patients with COPD exacerbation in relation with surrogate markers of exacerbation and long-term mortality in hospitalized patients with COPD. Materials and Methods 117 hospitalized COPD patients were included between January 2010 to June 2013. Information was obtained through the patients' records and the electronic database of the hospital. The patients who had on vitamin D and/or calcium therapy, and who were suspected of asthma were excluded from the study. Result The study included 117 patients and none of them were on vitamin D replacement on entry. The mean age was 67.95 ± 9.8 years. The number of male/female patients was 104/13. The mean forced expiratory volume in one second in percent predicted (FEV1%) was 39.97 ± 18.45. One hundred fifteen patients had vitamin D deficiency whereas only two patients had vitamin D ≥ 30 ng/dL. Seventy nine (69.5%) of the patients had severe vitamin D deficiency (< 10 ng/dL). The percentage of frequent exacerbators, patients who had microorganism growth and the median duration of hospital stay, mean FEV1 and survival did not differ between the group of vitamin D < or ≥ 10 ng/dL. There was no meaningful correlation of vitamin D level and any of the surrogate markers of exacerbation. Conclusions Severe vitamin D deficiency is heavily prevalent in Turkish COPD patients. However, it did not have an association on exacerbation and long term survival.","Köktürk, Nurdan; Koç, Esra Meltem; Körlü Akkale, Tuğba; Bahçecioğlu, Sakine",Tuberkuloz ve toraks,849,31

The authors report their experience using SPA sigmoidectomy as an early-elective approach to complicated diverticulitis with paracolic abscess. METHODS Between September 2009 und April 2010, 4 patients underwent SPA sigmoidectomy for Hinchey-I diverticulitis using the reusable X-Cone device. RESULTS After a median time of antibiotic treatment of 8 days, SPA sigmoidectomy was performed successfully in all patients. The median operative time was 200 minutes (range, 187-221 minutes). No intraoperative or postoperative complications were recorded; the median postoperative hospital stay was 7 days (range, 5-7 days). No incisional hernias were observed at midterm follow-up (median, 11.5 months; range, 8-14 months). CONCLUSIONS When performed by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon, early-elective SPA sigmoidectomy is a feasible and safe approach to complicated diverticulitis. The reusability of the X-Cone device ensures that the costs of the procedure are not high.","Reibetanz, Joachim; Kerscher, Alexander; Kim, Mia; Wierlemann, Alexander; Germer, Christoph-Thomas; Krajinovic, Katica",Surgical innovation,849,25

While several studies have researched short-term effects of noise, no long-term research has examined whether observed patterns persist or if community recovery can occur. We used a long-term study system in New Mexico to examine the effects of continuous natural gas well noise exposure on seedling recruitment of foundational tree species (Pinus edulis, Juniperus osteosperma) and vegetation diversity. First, we examined seedling recruitment and vegetation diversity at plots where current noise levels have persisted for greater than 15 years. We then examined recruitment and diversity on plots where noise sources were recently removed or added. We found support for long-term negative effects of noise on tree seedling recruitment, evenness of woody plants and increasingly dissimilar vegetation communities with differences in noise levels. Furthermore, seedling recruitment and plant community composition did not recover following noise removal, possibly due in part to a lag in recovery among animals that disperse and pollinate plants. Our results add to the limited evidence that noise has cascading ecological effects. Moreover, these effects may be long lasting and noise removal may not lead to immediate recovery.","Phillips, Jennifer N; Termondt, Sarah E; Francis, Clinton D",Proceedings. Biological sciences,849,1

Chronic Plasmodium falciparum exposure affects the B cell compartment, leading to the accumulation of atypical memory B cells (atMBCs). IgM-positive (IgM+) and IgG+ atMBCs have not been compared in-depth in the context of malaria, nor is it known if atMBCs in malaria-experienced individuals are different from phenotypically similar B cells in individuals with no known history of Plasmodium exposure. To address these questions, we characterized the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire of naive B cells (NBCs), IgM+ and IgG+ classical MBCs (cMBCs), and IgM+ and IgG+ atMBCs from 13 malaria-naive American adults and 7 malaria-experienced Ugandan adults. Our results demonstrate that P. falciparum exposure mainly drives changes in atMBCs. In comparison to malaria-naive adults, the BCR repertoire of Plasmodium-exposed adults showed increased levels of somatic hypermutation in the heavy chain V region in IgM+ and IgG+ atMBCs, shorter heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) in IgG+ atMBCs, and increased usage of IGHV3-73 in IgG+ cMBCs and both IgM+ and IgG+ atMBCs. Irrespective of Plasmodium exposure, IgM+ atMBCs closely resembled NBCs, while IgG+ atMBCs resembled IgG+ cMBCs. Physicochemical properties of the HCDR3 seemed to be intrinsic to cell type and independent of malaria experience. The resemblance between atMBCs from Plasmodium-exposed and naive adults suggests similar differentiation pathways regardless of chronic antigen exposure. Moreover, these data demonstrate that IgM+ and IgG+ atMBCs are distinct populations that should be considered separately in future analyses. IMPORTANCE Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites, still contributes to a high global burden of disease, mainly in children under 5 years of age. Chronic and recurrent Plasmodium infections affect the development of B cell memory against the parasite and promote the accumulation of atypical memory B cells (atMBCs), which have an unclear function in the immune response. Understanding where these cells originate from and whether they are beneficial in the immune response to Plasmodium will help inform vaccination development efforts. We found differences in B cell receptor (BCR) properties of atMBCs between malaria-naive and malaria-experienced adults that are suggestive of divergent selection processes, resulting in more somatic hypermutation and differential immunoglobulin heavy chain V (IGHV) gene usage. Despite these differences, atMBCs from malaria-naive and malaria-experienced adults also showed many similarities in BCR characteristics, such as physicochemical properties of the HCDR3 region, suggesting that atMBCs undergo similar differentiation pathways in response to different pathogens. Our study provides new insights into the effects of malaria experience on the B cell compartment and the relationships between atMBCs and other B cell populations.","Braddom, Ashley E; Bol, Sebastiaan; Gonzales, S Jake; Reyes, Raphael A; Musinguzi, Kenneth; Nankya, Felistas; Ssewanyana, Isaac; Greenhouse, Bryan; Bunnik, Evelien M",mSphere,849,31

The present study explored risk factors associated with parenting stress and implications for children's emotion regulation in families with different socioeconomic risks. Parents of 2-14 years old children completed a survey reporting difficulties experienced due to the lockdown, level of household chaos, parenting stress, parent involvement in the child's daily life, and children emotion regulation competences. The general mean levels of parenting stress and children emotion regulation abilities were not at clinical level compared with Italian norms. Household chaos predicted higher levels of parenting stress, which, in turn, was associated with less effective emotion regulation in children through the mediating role of parental involvement. More stressed parents were less involved in their children's activities, decreasing children's effective emotion regulation. Only for SES no-risk families, the lockdown constraints increased parenting stress. For SES at-risk families, the impact of parenting stress and involvement on children regulation strategies was stronger, with a protective role played by parental involvement on children's negativity not evident for SES no-risk families. Dealing with the lockdown is a stressful experience for parents who have to balance personal life, work, and children upbringing, without other help. This situation potentially impairs their ability to be supportive caregivers and is consequently detrimental for children well-being. Policies should take into consideration the implications of the lockdown for families' mental health and tailor supportive interventions according to family's risk factors.","Spinelli, Maria; Lionetti, Francesca; Setti, Annalisa; Fasolo, Mirco",Family process,849,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS From January 2015 to January 2016, nasopharyngeal swabs from 450 children, aged ≤2 years, who had been admitted to the Pediatric Department of the Maputo Central Hospital (HCM) in Mozambique, suffering with SARI were enrolled and tested for influenza and RSV using a real-time PCR assay. RESULTS Influenza and RSV were detected in 2.4% (11/450) and 26.7% (113/424) of the participants. Children with influenza were slightly older than those infected with RSV (10 months in influenza-infected children compared to 3 months in RSV-infected children); male children were predominant in both groups (63.6% versus 54.9% in children with influenza and RSV, respectively). There was a trend towards a higher frequency of influenza (72.7%) and RSV (93.8%) cases in the dry season. Bronchopneumonia, bronchitis and respiratory distress were the most common diagnoses at admission. Antibiotics were administered to 27,3% and 15,9% of the children with influenza and RSV, respectively. Two children, of whom, one was positive for RSV (aged 6 months) and another was positive for Influenza (aged 3 months) died; both were children of HIV seropositive mothers and had bronchopneumonia. CONCLUSIONS Our data demonstrated that RSV, and less frequently influenza, occurs in children with SARI in urban/sub-urban settings from southern Mozambique. The occurrence of deaths in small children suspected of being HIV-infected, suggests that particular attention should be given to this vulnerable population. Our data also provide evidence of antibiotics prescription in children with respiratory viral infection, which represents an important public health problem and calls for urgent interventions.","Pale, Mirela; Nacoto, Afonso; Tivane, Almiro; Nguenha, Neuza; Machalele, Loira; Gundane, Félix; Muteto, Délcio; Chilundo, Josina; Mavale, Sandra; Semá-Baltazar, Cynthia; Pires, Germano; Augusto, Orvalho; Mussá, Tufária; Gudo, Eduardo",PloS one,849,16

METHODS Between December 2009 and December 2010, 30 patients underwent transumbilical laparo-endoscopic single-site adrenalectomy at our hospital. The procedure was carried out for adrenal cortical adenoma in 17 patients, adrenal pheochromocytoma in seven patients and other types of tumors in six patients. A multichannel port, bent laparoscopic instruments and Opti4 laparoscopic electrodes were used in all patients. The intraperitoneal space was approached through the umbilicus. The multichannel port was placed through a 2-cm incision at the inner edge of the umbilicus. A 5-mm flexible laparoscope was introduced to maintain an adequate laparoscopic view, and surgical specimens were extracted using an Endocatch bag. RESULTS All procedures were successfully completed, with only one incision through the umbilicus, and without conversion to a standard laparoscopic approach. Mean operative time was 120.1 ± 34.7 min. Tumor laterality and patient body mass index did not affect surgical morbidity. The initial 15 patients had a significantly longer mean pneumoperitoneum time (95.8 ± 37.5 min) than the last 15 patients (70.5 ± 18.7 min). Only one postoperative complication was observed (postoperative hematoma).

BACKGROUND Except for topiramate, oral preventive treatment for chronic migraine lacks credible evidence. METHODS Chronic migraine patients aged above 18 years and less than 65 years of age, not on any preventive treatment were randomly allocated to receive topiramate (100 mg/day) or propranolol (160 mg/day). The primary efficacy outcome was the mean change in migraine days per 28 days at the end of 24 weeks from baseline. A mean difference of 1.5 days per four weeks was chosen as the cut-off delta value. Multiple secondary efficacy outcomes and treatment emergent adverse events were also assessed. RESULTS As against the planned sample size of 244, only 175 patients could be enrolled before the spread of the corona virus disease-2019 pandemic and enforcement of lockdown in India. Of the 175 randomized patients, 95 (topiramate 46 and propranolol 49) completed the trial. The mean change in migraine days was -5.3 ± 1.2 vs -7.3 ± 1.1 days (p = 0.226) for topiramate and propranolol groups respectively. Propranolol was found to be non-inferior and not superior to topiramate (point estimate of -1.99 with a 95% confidence interval of -5.23 to 1.25 days). Multiple secondary outcomes also did not differ between the two groups. Intention to treat analysis of 175 patients and per-protocol analysis of 95 patients yielded concordant results. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between the two groups. CONCLUSION Propranolol (160mg/day) was non-inferior, non-superior to topiramate (100mg/day) for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine and had a comparable tolerability profile.Trial Registration: Clinical Trials Registry-India CTRI/2019/05/018997).","Chowdhury, Debashish; Bansal, Luv; Duggal, Ashish; Datta, Debabrata; Mundra, Ankit; Krishnan, Anand; Koul, Arun; Gupta, Anu",Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache,849,1

The end result is a lone incision at the umbilicus for a perceived scarless abdomen. We report our early experience using the SILS technique for appendectomies in the pediatric population. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed on our first patients to undergo SILS appendectomy (SILS-A) or laparoscopic appendectomy (LAP-A) during the same period at a freestanding children's hospital. RESULTS Thirty-nine patients were reviewed. Nineteen patients underwent SILS-A (8.7 +/- 0.76 [SEM] years old), and 20 patients underwent LAP-A (10.5 +/- 0.87 years old, 2-17). Ages were 19 months to 14 years in the SILS-A group, with 21% (4 patients) not older than 6 years. Median weight for SILS-A was 32 kg (14.5-80.3). Twelve patients had acute nonperforated appendicitis (62%). Mean duration of operation was 58 +/- 5.6 (30-135) minutes vs 43 +/- 3.6 (30-85) minutes for standard LAP-A. Two patients were converted to a transumbilical appendectomy, one for inability to maintain a pneumoperitoneum and one for extensive adhesions. Postoperative complications consisted of one wound seroma. No wound infections, hernias, readmissions, or difference in length of stay were noted. CONCLUSION The SILS approach for acute appendicitis is feasible in the pediatric population even in patients as young as 19 months. Operating room times are somewhat longer than with LAP-A, but should decrease with improved instrumentation and experience. Larger studies and further technical refinements are needed before its widespread implementation.","Oltmann, Sarah C; Garcia, Nilda M; Ventura, Brenda; Mitchell, Ian; Fischer, Anne C",Journal of pediatric surgery,849,1

DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS National probability sample of older community-dwelling U.S. adults interviewed in 2015-2016, including 1268 women and 973 men (mean age 75 years and 76 years, respectively; 82% non-Hispanic white). MEASUREMENTS Frequency of participation in formal activities (organized meetings, religious services, and volunteering) and informal social activities (visiting friends and family) was assessed by questionnaire. Elder mistreatment included emotional (four items), physical (two items), and financial mistreatment (two items) since age 60. Multivariable logistic regression examined associations between each type of social participation and elder mistreatment among men and women, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, education, and comorbidity. RESULTS Forty percent of women and 22% of men reported at least one form of mistreatment (emotional, physical, or financial). Women reporting at least monthly engagement in formal social activities were more likely to report emotional mistreatment (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.33). Among men, monthly organized meeting attendance was associated with increased odds of emotional mistreatment (AOR 1.34, 95% CI 1.01-1.93). Weekly informal socializing was inversely associated with emotional mistreatment (AOR 0.59, 95% CI 0.44-0.78) and financial mistreatment (AOR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42-0.85) among women. CONCLUSION In this national cohort, older adults who were frequently engaged in formal social activities reported similar or higher levels of mistreatment than those with less frequent organized social participation. Older women with regular informal contact with family or friends were less likely to report some kinds of mistreatment. Strategies for detecting and mitigating elder mistreatment should consider differences in patterns of formal and informal social participation and their potential contribution to mistreatment risk.","Yang, Emmy Z; Kotwal, Ashwin A; Lisha, Nadra E; Wong, Jaclyn S; Huang, Alison J",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,849,24

Unfortunately, immunological rejection is the primary cause of graft failure for CT and therefore advances in immune regulation to induce tolerance remains an unmet medical need. Recently, our work and others in pre-clinical studies found that cyclophosphamide (Cy) administered after (""post-transplant,"" PTCy) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), i.e., liquid transplants is effective for graft vs. host disease prophylaxis and enhances overall survival. Importantly, within the past 10 years, PTCy has been widely adopted for clinical HSCT and the results at many centers have been extremely encouraging. The present studies found that Cy can be effectively employed to prolong the survival of SOT, specifically mouse corneal allografts. The results demonstrated that the timing of PTCy administration is critical for these CT and distinct from the kinetics employed following allogeneic HSCT. PTCy was observed to interfere with neovascularization, a process critically associated with immune rejection of corneal tissue that ensues following the loss of ocular ""immune privilege."" PTCy has the potential to delete or directly suppress allo-reactive T cells and treatment here was shown to diminish T cell rejection responses. These PTCy doses were observed to spare significant levels of CD4+ FoxP3+ (Tregs) which were found to be functional and could readily receive stimulating signals leading to their in vivo expansion via TNFRSF25 and CD25 agonists. In total, we posit future studies can take advantage of Cy based platforms to generate combinatorial strategies for long-term tolerance induction.","Lightbourn, Casey O; Wolf, Dietlinde; Copsel, Sabrina N; Wang, Ying; Pfeiffer, Brent J; Barreras, Henry; Bader, Cameron S; Komanduri, Krishna V; Perez, Victor L; Levy, Robert B",Frontiers in immunology,849,1

The paradigms primarily discussed are mothership and drip and ship. Less attention has been focused on the drip-and-drive (DD) paradigm. Our aim was to analyze whether and under what conditions DD would predict the greatest probability of good outcome for patients with suspected ischemic stroke in Northwestern Germany. Methods- Conditional probability models based on the decay curves for endovascular therapy and intravenous thrombolysis were created to determine the best transport paradigm, and results were displayed using map visualizations. Our study area consisted of the federal states of Lower Saxony, Hamburg, and Schleswig-Holstein in Northwestern Germany covering an area of 64 065 km2 with a population of 12 703 561 in 2017 (198 persons per km2). In several scenarios, the catchment area, that is, the region that would result in the greatest probability of good outcomes, was calculated for each of the mothership, drip-and-ship, and the DD paradigms. Several different treatment time parameters were varied including onset-to-first-medical-response time, ambulance-on-scene time, door-to-needle time at primary stroke center, needle-to-door time, door-to-needle time at comprehensive stroke center, door-to-groin-puncture time, needle-to-interventionalist-leave time, and interventionalist-arrival-to-groin-puncture time. Results- The mothership paradigm had the largest catchment area; however, the DD catchment area was larger than the drip-and-ship catchment area so long as the needle-to-interventionalist-leave time and the interventionalist-arrival-to-groin-puncture time remain <40 minutes each. A slowed workflow in the DD paradigm resulted in a decrease of the DD catchment area to 1221 km2 (2%). Conclusions- Our study suggests the largest catchment area for the mothership paradigm and a larger catchment area of DD paradigm compared with the drip-and-ship paradigm in Northwestern Germany in most scenarios. The existence of different paradigms allows the spread of capacities, shares the cost and hospital income, and gives primary stroke centers the possibility to provide endovascular therapy services 24/7.","Ernst, Marielle; Schlemm, Eckhard; Holodinsky, Jessalyn K; Kamal, Noreen; Thomalla, Götz; Fiehler, Jens; Brekenfeld, Caspar",Stroke,849,7

The potential risks and benefits are still being studied, and little is known about how patients perceive this new surgical technique. METHODS After providing patients with basic educational materials on laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and SILC, we administered a questionnaire exploring patients' perspectives of the importance of postoperative pain, scar appearance, risk of complications, and cost regarding their preference for SILC versus LC. RESULTS Among 100 patients (mean age, 43.3 years), the majority were women (85%), white (85%), college educated (77%), and privately insured (85%). Indications included biliary dyskinesia (43%), biliary colic (48%), and acute cholecystitis (9%). Patients stated that they would be somewhat or very interested in SILC if recommended by their surgeon (89%), although 35% were somewhat or very concerned about the lack of long-term results. The majority would accept no additional risk to undergo SILC. Scar appearance was somewhat or very important to <40% of patients, whereas pain was somewhat or very important to 79%. Only 27% of patients would spend >$100 to undergo SILC. When asked to rank pain, appearance, symptom resolution, personal cost, and risk of complications, 52% ranked symptom resolution, 20% ranked pain, and 19% ranked risk of complications as most important. CONCLUSIONS Safety and relief of symptoms are most important to patients with gallbladder disease, whereas postprocedural esthetics was relatively unimportant and few would be willing to pay more for SILC versus LC. However, if the surgeon recommends SILC, most patients would trust this recommendation.","Joseph, Sigi P; Moore, B Todd; Slayden, Geoffrey; Sorensen, George B; Boettger, Conrad; Potter, David; Margolin, Daniel; Brown, Kimberly",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,849,24

METHODS Data regarding the incidence of tuberculosis between 1990 and 2004 were obtained from the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the data regarding the meteorological factors (including daily average temperatures, wind speeds, precipitations, relative humidities, vapor pressures and low cloud covers) between 1987 and 2004 were collected from the Beijing Meteorological Observatory and analyzed. Descriptive statistics and a back-propagation artificial neural network were adopted to analyze the data. RESULTS There were significant correlations between the incidence of tuberculosis and the meteorological factors in the corresponding year and previous years. Among these correlations, wind speed was the factor with the strongest influence on tuberculosis (the standardized significance was 100%). Additionally, all prediction models would successfully established, suggesting the use of a collection of meteorological factors spanning from three years ago to the present is superior to the use of single data. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of tuberculosis in Beijing area is correlated to meteorological factors in the current year and previous years, which verifies the practicality of the theory of five circuits and six qi.","Zhang, Xuan; Hao, Yu; Fei, Zhan-yang; He, Juan",Chinese journal of integrative medicine,849,1

Development of therapies requires biomarkers to diagnose, and monitor cachexia; however, no such markers are in use. Via Somascan, we measured ~1300 plasma proteins in 30 patients with PDAC vs. 11 controls. We found 60 proteins specific to local PDAC, 46 to metastatic, and 67 to presence of >5% cancer weight loss (FC ≥ |1.5|, p ≤ 0.05). Six were common for cancer stage (Up: GDF15, TIMP1, IL1RL1; Down: CCL22, APP, CLEC1B). Four were common for local/cachexia (C1R, PRKCG, ELANE, SOST: all oppositely regulated) and four for metastatic/cachexia (SERPINA6, PDGFRA, PRSS2, PRSS1: all consistently changed), suggesting that stage and cachexia status might be molecularly separable. We found 71 proteins that correlated with cachexia severity via weight loss grade, weight loss, skeletal muscle index and radiodensity (r ≥ |0.50|, p ≤ 0.05), including some known cachexia mediators/markers (LEP, MSTN, ALB) as well as novel proteins (e.g., LYVE1, C7, F2). Pathway, correlation, and upstream regulator analyses identified known (e.g., IL6, proteosome, mitochondrial dysfunction) and novel (e.g., Wnt signaling, NK cells) mechanisms. Overall, this study affords a basis for validation and provides insights into the processes underpinning cancer cachexia.","Narasimhan, Ashok; Shahda, Safi; Kays, Joshua K; Perkins, Susan M; Cheng, Lijun; Schloss, Katheryn N H; Schloss, Daniel E I; Koniaris, Leonidas G; Zimmers, Teresa A",Cancers,849,16

The aim of this research was to confirm that Holder pasteurization (62.5°C for 30 min) would be sufficient to inactivate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in donated human milk samples. METHODS We spiked frozen milk samples from 10 donors to the Rogers Hixon Ontario Human Milk Bank with SARSCoV-2 to achieve a final concentration of 1 × 107 TCID50/mL (50% of the tissue culture infectivity dose per mL). We pasteurized samples using the Holder method or held them at room temperature for 30 minutes and plated serial dilutions on Vero E6 cells for 5 days. We included comparative controls in the study using milk samples from the same donors without addition of virus (pasteurized and unpasteurized) as well as replicates of Vero E6 cells directly inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. We reported cytopathic effects as TCID50/mL. RESULTS We detected no cytopathic activity in any of the SARS-CoV-2-spiked milk samples that had been pasteurized using the Holder method. In the SARSCoV-2-spiked milk samples that were not pasteurized but were kept at room temperature for 30 minutes, we observed a reduction in infectious viral titre of about 1 log. INTERPRETATION Pasteurization of human milk by the Holder method (62.5°C for 30 min) inactivates SARS-CoV-2. Thus, in the event that donated human milk contains SARS-CoV-2 by transmission through the mammary gland or by contamination, this method of pasteurization renders milk safe for consumption and handling by care providers.","Unger, Sharon; Christie-Holmes, Natasha; Guvenc, Furkan; Budylowski, Patrick; Mubareka, Samira; Gray-Owen, Scott D; O'Connor, Deborah L",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,849,1

We observed transient delayed gastric emptying (DGE) post-LNF in our preliminary study. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence rate and development of transient DGE post-LNF. METHODS Patients who underwent LNF for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) at our institution were recruited consecutively. They were treated with standardized LNF and prospectively followed up for 2 months. Proper diet guidance and/or pharmacologic therapy were given during these 2 months. GERD Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL), DGE symptoms, and DGE status were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS Fifty-one patients underwent LNF and completed a 2-month follow-up. LNF succeeded in all patients. Prior to LNF, no DGE was identified. At the 1-month follow-up, LNF led to a significant reduction in the GERD-HRQL total score but a significantly increased DGE score. Endoscopically, DGE was identified in forty-seven (n = 47, 92.2%) patients. At the 2-month follow-up, the GERD-HRQL scores continued to show decreases compared to the 1 month. The DGE score returned to the baseline value. Endoscopically, no DGE was identified in any patients (n = 0, 0.0%). CONCLUSIONS Transient DGE is a very common one-month post-LNF but can recover quickly in the second month following LNF.","He, Suyu; Jia, Yingdong; Xu, Fei; Li, Qianlong; Xiong, Xin; Wang, Hui; Jing, Xiaojuan; Yang, Xuejun; He, Lianfen; Wang, Hanmei; Tao, Xin",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,849,1

Two different multichannel ports were used during operations. We describe the technique of single-port extraperitoneal transvesical adenomectomy and present the initial operative experience. METHODS Three patients in whom an open adenomectomy was indicated underwent single-port extraperitoneal transvesical adenomectomy. Following preparation of the extraperitoneal space via an umbilical incision, a multichannel port was inserted. A transverse cystotomy adjacent to the prostatovesical junction, incision of mucosa overlying the adenoma, subcapsular plane development, prostatic adenomectomy and cystotomy repair were performed as the standard steps of the laparoscopic procedure. RESULTS All cases were completed without conversion to standard laparoscopy. Mean operative time was 105 min. Mean blood loss was 190 ml. Hospital stay was 4 days and catheter duration was 6 days for all patients. No intraoperative or postoperative complication occurred. CONCLUSIONS Single-port extraperitoneal transvesical adenomectomy for large benign prostate hyperplasia is feasible with excellent cosmetic results and minimal morbidity.","Oktay, Bulent; Vuruskan, Hakan; Koc, Gokhan; Danisoglu, Mahmut Esad; Kordan, Yakup",Urologia internationalis,849,1

Conservative management is tried initially, but if this fails, surgery is indicated. There are few reports in the literature concerning superior mesenteric artery syndrome in children, and fewer still managed surgically by minimally invasive means. CASE PRESENTATION A 12-year-old girl presented with weight loss, early satiety and vomiting after corrective scoliosis surgery. After upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, contrast study and computed tomography imaging, a diagnosis of superior mesenteric artery syndrome was made. Conservative management by nasojejunal feeding failed; therefore, a laparoscopic duodeno-jejunostomy was undertaken. At follow-up, her symptoms had improved. CONCLUSION This report describes the youngest child to undergo laparoscopic duodeno-jejunostomy for superior mesenteric artery syndrome. Laparoscopic duodeno-jejunostomy appears to be the most widely employed and reliable minimally invasive approach to superior mesenteric artery syndrome with a high success rate and acceptably low complication rate.","Cullis, Paul S; Gallagher, Maeve; Sabharwal, Atul J; Hammond, Philip",Scottish medical journal,849,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS This study consisted of an Institutional Review Board-approved single-institution retrospective analysis of NET patients who received transarterial chemoembolization from 2006 to 2016 and TARE from 2005 to 2014 and survived at least 1 year from the initial treatment. Patients receiving only transarterial chemoembolization (n = 63) or TARE (n = 28) were evaluated for the presence or absence of durable hepatic toxicities occurring at least 6 months after initial treatment. The definitions and grades of liver injury were adapted from Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 and were characterized by the presence of laboratory or clinical toxicities of Grade 3 or above. RESULTS Chronic hepatic toxicity occurred in 14 of 63 transarterial chemoembolization patients (22%) with a total of 26 Grade 3-4 events, in whom elevation of bilirubin was the most common toxicity, compared to 8 of 28 TARE patients (29%) with a total of 16 Grade 3-4 and 2 Grade 5 events, in whom ascites were the most frequent toxicity. There were more laboratory toxicities in the transarterial chemoembolization group (65% vs 38%, P = .11) and fewer Grade 4-5 injuries (6% vs 27% of patients, P = .06). There was also a significantly higher number of patients who experienced intrahepatic progression of disease in the transarterial chemoembolization cohort than in the TARE patients (75% vs 43%, respectively; P = .005). CONCLUSIONS Delayed hepatotoxicity from transarterial chemoembolization and TARE occurred in 22% and 29% of patients, respectively, from 6 months to several years following treatment. Transarterial chemoembolization-related toxicities on average were less severe and manifested primarily as laboratory derangements, compared to TARE toxicities which consisted of clinical hepatic decompensation.","Currie, Brian M; Nadolski, Gregory; Mondschein, Jeffrey; Dagli, Mandeep; Sudheendra, Deepak; Stavropoulos, S William; Soulen, Michael C",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,849,27

Methods: A U.S. nationwide survey of 500 adults was conducted; data from 201 individuals (Mage=38.98, SD=12.04, 52.2% female, 76.1% White) who endorsed current alcohol use were included in this study. Results: Paired-samples t-tests indicated that there was a significant decrease in drinking quantity [t(199)=3.74, p<.001], but no change in drinking frequency [t(198)=0.19, p=.849] overall during the first month of the U.S. pandemic. There were significant decreases in enhancement [t(201)=4.55, p<.001], social [t(201)=9.39, p<.001] and conformity [t(201)=3.58, p<.001] motives, but a significant increase in coping motives [t(201)=-3.71, p<.001]. Regression analyses showed that increases in enhancement [β=0.46, p<.001] and coping [β=0.27, p=.004] motives were significantly related to increases in drinking frequency, and increases in coping motives [β=0.32, p=.002] were related to increases in drinking quantity. Riskier drinking prior to the pandemic was significantly related to greater increase in drinking quantity in the first month of the U.S. pandemic [β=0.31, p<.001]. Conclusion: Results of this study provide initial support that changes in drinking motives were important predictors for changes in alcohol use during the first month of the U.S. pandemic. Contrary to anecdotal reports, drinking decreased overall during the first month of the U.S. pandemic; however, those with existing risky patterns of drinking prior to the start of the U.S. pandemic were at greatest risk for drinking escalation during this time.","Prestigiacomo, Christiana J; Liu, Melissa A; Plawecki, Martin H; Cyders, Melissa A",Substance use & misuse,849,5

Fifty-five captive small Indian civets (Viverricula indica), farmed for perfume production in Eastern Thailand, showed clinical signs of acute bloody diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, circling, and seizures. The disease spread within the farm and resulted in the death of 38 of the 55 civets (69% mortality) within a month. Fecal swabs were collected from the 17 surviving civets, and necropsy was performed on 7 of the dead civets. Pathologic findings were severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis with generalized lymphadenopathy. CPPV-1 was identified in both fecal swabs and postmortem samples by species-specific polymerase chain reaction. Further whole-gene sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis suggested feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) as the causative agent. The viral tropism and tissue distribution were confirmed by immunohistochemistry, with immunolabeling in the cytoplasm and nucleus of small intestinal crypt epithelial cells, villous enterocytes, histiocytes in lymphoid tissues, myenteric nerve plexuses, and cerebral and cerebellar neurons. Phylogenetic analysis of civet-derived CPPV-1 indicated a genetic similarity close to the FPV HH-1/86 strain detected in a jaguar (Panthera onca) in China. To our knowledge, this mass die-off of civets is the first evidence of disease associated with CPPV-1 infection in the subfamily Viverrinae. These findings support the multi-host range of parvovirus infection and raises awareness for CPPV-1 disease outbreaks in wildlife species.","Chaiyasak, Surangkanang; Piewbang, Chutchai; Banlunara, Wijit; Techangamsuwan, Somporn",Veterinary pathology,849,31

Behavior changes compound this, altering both true dynamics and reporting patterns, particularly for diseases with nonspecific symptoms, such as influenza. We disentangle these effects to unravel the hidden dynamics of the 2009 influenza A/H1N1pdm pandemic in London, where surveillance suggests an unusual dominant peak in the summer. We embed an age-structured model into a bayesian synthesis of multiple evidence sources to reveal substantial changes in contact patterns and health-seeking behavior throughout the epidemic, uncovering two similar infection waves, despite large differences in the reported levels of disease. We show how this approach, which allows for real-time learning about model parameters as the epidemic progresses, is also able to provide a sequence of nested projections that are capable of accurately reflecting the epidemic evolution.","Birrell, Paul J; Ketsetzis, Georgios; Gay, Nigel J; Cooper, Ben S; Presanis, Anne M; Harris, Ross J; Charlett, André; Zhang, Xu-Sheng; White, Peter J; Pebody, Richard G; De Angelis, Daniela",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,849,7

Little is known about the risk factors for the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in children. METHODS A retrospective case-control study was taken in children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus-2 infection in Wuhan Children's Hospital. Risk factors associated with the development of COVID-19 and progression were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Eight out of 260 children diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study. Thirty-five children with COVID-19 infection matched for age, sex and date of admission, and who classified as non-severe type, were randomly selected from the hospital admissions. For cases with severe pneumonia caused by COVID-19, the most common symptoms were dyspnea (87.5%), fever (62.5%) and cough (62.5%). In laboratory, white blood cells count was significantly higher in severe children than non-severe children. Levels of inflammation bio-makers such as hsCRP, IL-6, IL-10 and D-dimer elevated in severe children compared with non-severe children on admission. The level of total bilirubin and uric acid clearly elevated in severe children compared with non-severe children on admission. All of severe children displayed the lesions on chest CT, more lung segments were involved in severe children than in non-severe children, which was only risk factor associated with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS More than 3 lung segments involved were associated with greater risk of development of severe COVID-19 in children. Moreover, the possible risk of the elevation of IL-6, high total bilirubin and D-dimer with univariable analysis could identify patients to be severe earlier.","Wang, Yanli; Zhu, Feng; Wang, Cheng; Wu, Jing; Liu, Jie; Chen, Xue; Xiao, Han; Liu, Zhisheng; Wu, Zubo; Lu, Xiaoxia; Ma, Jiehui; Zeng, Ye; Peng, Hua; Sun, Dan",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,849,28

Recent guidelines recommend keeping any interruptions of chest compressions as short as possible and not lasting more than 10 seconds. Endotracheal intubation seems to be the ideal method for establishing a secure airway by experienced providers, but emergency medical technicians (EMT) often lack training and practice. For the EMTs supraglottic devices might serve as alternatives. METHODS 40 EMTs were trained in a 1-hour standardised audio-visual lesson to handle six different airway devices including endotracheal intubation, Combitube, EasyTube, I-Gel, Laryngeal Mask Airway and Laryngeal tube. EMTs performances were evaluated immediately after a brief practical demonstration, as well as after 1 and 3 months without any practice in between, in a randomised order. Hands-off time was pair-wise compared between airway devices using a repeated-measures mixed-effects model. RESULTS Overall mean hands-off time was significantly (p<0.01) lower for Laryngeal tube (6.1s; confidence interval 5.2-6.9s), Combitube (7.9s; 95% CI 6.9-9.0s), EasyTube (8.8s; CI 7.3-10.3s), LMA (10.2s; CI 8.6-11.7s), and I-Gel (11.9s; CI 10.2-13.7s) compared to endotracheal intubation (39.4s; CI 34.0-44.9s). Hands-off time was within the recommended limit of 10s for Combitube, EasyTube and Laryngeal tube after 1 month and for all supraglottic devices after 3 months without any training, but far beyond recommended limits in all three evaluations for endotracheal intubation. CONCLUSION Using supraglottic airway devices, EMTs achieved a hands-off time within the recommended time limit of 10s, even after three months without any training or practice. Supraglottic airway devices are recommended tools for EMTs with lack of experience in advanced airway management.","Gruber, Christina; Nabecker, Sabine; Wohlfarth, Philipp; Ruetzler, Anita; Roth, Dominik; Kimberger, Oliver; Fischer, Henrik; Frass, Michael; Ruetzler, Kurt","Scandinavian journal of trauma, resuscitation and emergency medicine",849,24

While the pre-pandemic focus of policy experts and government reports was on the question of whether to add outpatient pharmaceuticals to universal health coverage, the clustering of pandemic deaths in long-term care facilities has spurred calls for federal standards in long-term care (LTC) and its possible inclusion in universal health coverage. This has led to the probability that the federal government will attempt to expand medicare as Canadians have known it for the first time in over a half century. However, these efforts are likely to fail if the federal government relies on the shared-cost federalism that marked the earlier introduction of medicare. Two alternative pathways are suggested, one for LTC and one for pharmaceuticals, that are more likely to succeed given the state of the Canadian federation in the early 21st century.","Marchildon, Gregory P; Tuohy, Carolyn H","Health economics, policy, and law",849,1

Recently, we identified GATA4 as the master regulator of LSEC specification during development. Here, we studied endothelial GATA4 in the adult liver and in hepatic disease pathogenesis. METHODS We generated adult Clec4g-icretg/0xGata4fl/fl (Gata4LSEC-KO) mice with deficiency of Gata4 in LSEC. Livers were analyzed by histology, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence, in-situ hybridization, and by expression profiling, ChIP- and ATAC-sequencing of isolated LSEC. For liver regeneration, partial hepatectomy was performed. As models of liver fibrosis, CDAA diet and chronic CCl4 exposure were applied. Human single cell RNAseq data sets were analyzed for endothelial alterations in healthy and cirrhotic livers. RESULTS Genetic Gata4 deficiency in LSEC of adult mice caused perisinusoidal liver fibrosis, hepatopathy and impaired liver regeneration. Sinusoidal capillarization and LSEC-to-continuous endothelial transdifferentiation were accompanied by a profibrotic angiocrine switch including de novo endothelial expression of hepatic stellate cell-activating cytokine Pdgfb. Increased chromatin accessibility and amplification by activated MYC mediated angiocrine Pdgfb expression. In CDAA diet-induced perisinusoidal liver fibrosis, LSEC showed repression of GATA4, activation of MYC and the profibrotic angiocrine switch already detected in Gata4LSEC-KO mice. Comparison of CDAA-fed Gata4LSEC-KO and control mice demonstrated that endothelial GATA4 indeed protects from dietary-induced perisinusoidal liver fibrosis. In human cirrhotic livers, GATA4-positive LSEC and endothelial GATA4 target genes were reduced, while non-LSEC endothelial cells and MYC target genes including PDGFB were enriched. CONCLUSIONS Endothelial GATA4 protects from perisinusoidal liver fibrosis by repressing MYC activation and profibrotic angiocrine signaling on the chromatin level. Therapies targeting the GATA4/MYC/PDGFB/PDGFRβ axis offer a promising strategy for prevention and treatment of liver fibrosis.","Winkler, Manuel; Staniczek, Theresa; Kürschner, Sina Wietje; Schmid, Christian David; Schönhaber, Hiltrud; Cordero, Julio; Kessler, Linda; Mathes, Arthur; Sticht, Carsten; Neßling, Michelle; Uvarovskii, Alexey; Anders, Simon; Zhang, Xue-Jun; von Figura, Guido; Hartmann, Daniel; Mogler, Carolin; Dobreva, Gergana; Schledzewski, Kai; Géraud, Cyrill; Koch, Philipp-Sebastian; Goerdt, Sergij",Journal of hepatology,849,16

Many patients after LAGB failure choose LSG as a further bariatric surgery (secondary LSG). However, LAGB often impairs upper stomach anatomy and physiology, which may contribute to complications increased risk after secondary LSG, in comparison to surgery-naive obese patients choosing LSG (primary LSG). METHODS A retrospective cohort study was conducted on a prospective database, looking at morbidly obese patients for LSG surgery. All procedures were done by a single surgeon at the Soroka Medical Center between January 2008 and March 2013. Data were collected from hospitalization charts on demographics, biometric and bariatric status, medical and bariatric surgical history, post-LSG morbidity, and mortality. RESULTS Three hundred eight patients underwent LSG during the study period, 181 (58.8 %) had a primary LSG while 127 (41.2 %) had a secondary LSG. No mortality occurred in both groups. Odds ratio for major complication (leak, stenosis) was 3.12 [CI 0.90-10.75] among the secondary LSG group, compared to the primary LSG (p = 0.071). The risk for major complication was doubled (OR = 2, 95 % CI [1.36-3.06]) for each one of previous bariatric procedure underwent (p = 0.001). Significant differences were found between the two groups regarding number and length of readmissions and number of imaging tests (p value = 0.027, 0.022, and 0.049, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Primary LSG is a safe and efficient bariatric procedure. After failed LAGB, secondary LSG should be carefully considered, because of a potentially higher risk of complications.","Guetta, Ohad; Ovnat, Amnon; Shaked, Gad; Czeiger, David; Sebbag, Gilbert",Obesity surgery,849,17

MATERIALS AND METHODS As this was retrospective analysis of anonymous data, medical ethics committee approval was waived by the regional health research authority. Patients, who had known iodinated contrast medium allergy, contraindications to β-blockers, atrial fibrillation, and indications other than suspected coronary artery disease, were excluded from analysis. The ultimate study population of 662 were analysed with details of intravenous metoprolol doses, complications, heart rate before administration of intravenous metoprolol (resting heart rate, RHR), heart rate at acquisition of scan (acquisition heart rate, AHR), and usage of low radiation dose protocols. RESULTS Of the ultimate study population of 662 patients, 183 had no intravenous metoprolol with mean acquisition heart rate (AHR) of 58 beats per minute (bpm), 257 had 1-15 mg intravenous metoprolol with mean AHR of 57 bpm, 114 had 16-29 mg intravenous metoprolol with mean AHR of 62 bpm and 108 had ≥30 mg intravenous metoprolol with mean AHR of 66 bpm. In the group receiving intravenous metoprolol, average usage was 19 mg (maximum 67 mg) with average reduction in HR of 15 bpm. There were no clinical incidents in relation to the use of high-dose intravenous metoprolol. CONCLUSION Higher doses of intravenous metoprolol are beneficial in achieving target heart rates to facilitate usage of low radiation dose protocols. With appropriate exclusion criteria, higher doses of intravenous metoprolol, well in excess of 15 mg, can be safely administered when carefully titrated.","Raju, V M; Gosling, O E; Morgan-Hughes, G; Colliver, R J; Iyengar, S; Dissanayake, P; Roobottom, C A",Clinical radiology,849,1

Preoperative embolization has been proposed to limit the often significant intraoperative blood loss associated with resection and potentially make the tumor more soft/necrotic and thus more amenable to gross total resection. The safety and efficacy of preoperative embolization of intracranial hemangioblastomas, however, are not well characterized. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and efficacy of preoperative endovascular embolization of intracranial hemangioblastomas using a variety of embolic agents. METHODS A retrospective review of all surgically resected intracranial hemangioblastomas treated with preoperative embolization between 1999 and 2014 at 2 high-volume centers was performed. Clinical and radiographic criteria, including von Hippel-Lindau status, magnetic resonance imaging tumor characteristics, embolization-related complications, degree of angiographic devascularization, intraoperative blood loss, ability to obtain gross total resection, transfusion requirements, and operative time, were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 54 patients underwent surgery, with 24 undergoing preoperative embolization followed by surgical resection, and 30 patients undergoing surgical resection alone. Embolization-related neurological complications were seen in 6 patients (25%), including 3 hemorrhages when polyvinyl alcohol particles (P = .04) were used and 3 infarctions when liquid embolic agents were used (P = .27). Permanent neurological deficits were seen in 15%. CONCLUSION Preoperative embolization of intracranial hemangioblastomas should be performed with caution, given the potential for neurological morbidity. Further studies are needed to help guide patient and embolic agent selection.","Ene, Chibawanye I; Xu, David; Morton, Ryan P; Emerson, Samuel; Levitt, Michael R; Barber, Jason; Rostomily, Robert C; Ghodke, Basavaraj V; Hallam, Danial K; Albuquerque, Felipe C; McDougall, Cameron G; Sekhar, Laligam N; Ferreira, Manuel; Kim, Louis J; Chang, Steve W",Operative neurosurgery,849,12

In embryonic development, progenitor fetal cells are actively involved in reparative mechanisms and display a biphasic interaction with the mother; and there is constant trafficking of fetal cells into maternal circulation and vice versa. This phenomenon of fetal microchimerism may have significant impact considering the primitive, multilineage nature of these cells. In published work, we have reported that fetal-derived placental cells expressing the homeodomain protein CDX2 retain all ""stem"" functional proteins of embryonic stem cells yet are endowed with additional functions in areas of growth, survival, homing, and immune modulation. These cells exhibit multipotency in vitro and in vivo, giving rise to spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes and vascular cells. In mouse models, CDX2 cells from female placentas can be administered intravenously to male mice subjected to myocardial infarction with subsequent homing of the CDX2 cells to infarcted areas and evidence of cellular regeneration with enhanced cardiac function. Elucidating the role of microchimeric fetal-derived placental cells may have broader scientific potential, as one can envision allogeneic cell therapy strategies targeted at tissue regeneration for a variety of organ systems.","Vadakke-Madathil, Sangeetha; Chaudhry, Hina W",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,849,1

This paper aimed to clarify key issues around loneliness among older adults and draw attention to innovative programs and the translation of emerging research into practice. Loneliness is a mismatch between a person's actual and desired social connections, experienced as negative emotions. Older adults are vulnerable to loneliness because of changes associated with ageing. As such, identifying as older is often seen as a burden, negatively impacting self-esteem, sense of purpose and relevance, culminating in loneliness. Interventions combatting loneliness can target individuals, relationships, communities or societies. We advocate for an intersectoral approach to support healthy ageing and reduce loneliness. This will require further research to evaluate new approaches with loneliness as the primary outcome, and additional funding to translate evidence into an integrated multi-level approach to addressing loneliness.","Ogrin, Rajna; Cyarto, Elizabeth V; Harrington, Karra D; Haslam, Catherine; Lim, Michelle H; Golenko, Xanthe; Bush, Matiu; Vadasz, Danny; Johnstone, Georgina; Lowthian, Judy A",Australasian journal on ageing,849,27

Videoconferencing, a telehealth subfield, has been mainly used for the medication management and delivery of psychological treatments for mood, adjustment and anxiety disorders, and to a lesser extent for psychotic disorders. Objectives The focus of this scoping review is on studies using videoconferencing for intervention for individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia-spectrum disorder and those who may be considered to be in the very early stages of psychosis (clinical high risk). The aim of this review is to assess the feasibility, acceptability and clinical benefits of videoconferencing interventions and compare them with face-to-face interventions for this population. Methods A scoping review of peer-reviewed original research on the use of videoconferencing for intervention purposes in individuals with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder or at clinical high risk. Results Out of 13,750 citations, 60 articles were retrieved for detailed evaluation, resulting in 14 eligible studies ( N = 439 individuals). There was no study reporting on videoconferencing interventions for individuals at clinical high risk. All the studies reported that videoconferencing implementation was feasible, and most of them described high acceptance by individuals with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder. However, selection bias of studies was high, and overall methodological quality was poor.

Recent advances in technology have enabled deep sequencing and analysis of members and signals of these communities. In a healthy state, the oral microbiome is composed of commensals, and their genes and phenotypes may be selected by the immune system to survive in symbiosis. These highly regulated signals are modulated by a network of microbial and host metabolites. However, in a diseased state, host-microbial networks lead to dysbiosis and considerable burden to the host prior to systemic impact that extends beyond the oral compartment. Interestingly, we presented data demonstrating similarities between human and mice immune dysbiosis and discussed how this affects the host response to similar pathobionts. The host and microbial signatures of a number of disease states are currently being examined to identify potential correlations. How the oral microbiome interacts with inflammation and the immune system to cause disease remains an area of active research. In this review, we summarize recent advancements in understanding the role of oral microbiota in mediating inflammation and altering systemic health and disease. In line with these findings, it is possible that existing conditions may be resolved by targeting specific immune-microbial markers in a positive way.","Kleinstein, S E; Nelson, K E; Freire, M",Journal of dental research,849,5

A simultaneous dramatic increase in IBD drug options has enabled most patients to achieve remission. Nevertheless, worldwide disparities in the approval of IBD drugs, or ""drug lag"", remain problematic. Summary Drug lag for major IBD drugs before March 31, 2018 (12 for Crohn's disease [CD] and 13 for ulcerative colitis [UC]) was compared between that of the United States (US), European Union (EU), and Asia (Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines) to assess current trends. In the US, unapproved IBD drugs accounted for 16.7% (2/12) for CD and 23.1% (3/13) for UC; approval lag was 3.8 (0-80.5) months for CD and 3.6 (0-88) months for UC. In the EU, unapproved drugs accounted for 16.7% (2/12) for CD and 15.4% (2/13) for UC; approval lag was 0.03 (0-13.9) months for CD and 0 (0-13.9) months for UC. This demonstrates the short drug lag in both regions, although one drug developed in a joint US/EU clinical trial had around a 350-day approval lag. In Asia, the proportion of unapproved IBD drugs was the lowest in Japan at 33.3% (4/12) for CD and 23.1% (3/13) for UC; South Korea had the shortest lag for CD at 13.2 (0-133.1) months and the Philippines had the shortest lag for UC at 9.9 (0.6-176.2) months, but these countries still had longer lag periods than the West. However, a proportion of unapproved drugs and approval lag has decreased considerably in Asia since the start of the biologics era. Key Messages Despite the recent shortening drug lag between different countries and regions, this study shows that disparities persist. With globalization, eliminating these disparate drug lags is necessary to manage IBD and may require efforts toward international adoption of a more standardized approval process.","Okabayashi, Shinji; Kobayashi, Taku; Hibi, Toshifumi",Inflammatory intestinal diseases,849,14

SETTING Primary care. DATA SOURCES Medline, EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), Clinicaltrials.gov, ISRCTN registry, OpenGrey, Annals of Family Medicine, BMC Family Practice, Family Practice and British Journal of General Practice (BJGP) from inception to the end of June 2021. STUDY SELECTION Included studies were original research (randomised controlled trial, quasi-experimental, cohort study, qualitative and case studies), protocol papers and protocol registrations. DATA EXTRACTION Screening and data extraction was completed by one reviewer; 10% of the studies were independently reviewed by a second reviewer. Coding of full-text articles in NVivo was conducted and mapped to five deprescribing principles. RESULTS Fifty studies were included. The most frequently used activities were identification of appropriate patients for deprescribing (76%), patient education (50%), general practitioners (GP) education (48%), and development and use of a tapering schedule (38%). Six activities did not align with the five deprescribing principles. As such, two principles (engage practice staff in education and appropriate identification of patients, and provide feedback to staff about deprescribing occurrences within the practice) were added. CONCLUSION Activities and guiding principles for deprescribing should be paired together to provide an accessible and comprehensive guide to deprescribing by GPs. The addition of two principles suggests that practice staff and practice management teams may play an instrumental role in sustaining deprescribing processes within clinical practice. Future research is required to determine the most of effective activities to use within each principle and by whom.","Coe, Amy; Kaylor-Hughes, Catherine; Fletcher, Susan; Murray, Elizabeth; Gunn, Jane",BMJ open,849,24

METHOD A systematic literature search was performed using five databases. Study selection criteria were randomized controlled trials published in English on physical therapy interventions targeting sitting, reporting developmental or functional sitting outcomes, and focused on young children with or at risk for CP (mean age ≤5y). Risk of bias (ROB) was assessed using the Cochrane ROB 2.0 tool. RESULTS Twelve unique studies met the inclusion criteria and were categorized into one of two categories: (1) comparison of two physical therapy interventions or (2) physical therapy plus adjunct versus physical therapy alone. The combined pooled effect size (g) for the 10 studies included in meta-analysis was large (g=0.78) but non-significant. Pooled effect for category 1 was small (g=-0.06) and non-significant. Interventions in category 2 showed a large and significant effect (g=1.90, p=0.022). INTERPRETATION There is a lack of strong evidence for physical therapy interventions targeting sitting in young children with or at-risk for CP due to limitations in methodological rigor and sample sizes. Components of impairment remediation combined with functional balance training should be explored to improve sitting in children diagnosed with CP. Given the benefits of early achievement of sitting, strong evidence-based research is needed.","Inamdar, Ketaki; Molinini, Rebecca M; Panibatla, Siva Tejaa; Chow, Jason C; Dusing, Stacey C",Developmental medicine and child neurology,849,1

Cleavage activation of influenza HA enables fusion with the host endosome, allowing for release of the viral genome into the host cell. To date, studies have determined that HA activation is driven by trypsin-like host cell proteases, as well as yet to be identified bacterial proteases. Although the number of host proteases that can activate HA is growing, there is still uncertainty regarding which secreted proteases are able to support multicycle replication of influenza. In this study, we have determined that the kallikrein-related peptidases 5 and 12 are secreted from the human respiratory tract and have the ability to cleave and activate HA from the H1, H2, and H3 subtypes. Each peptidase appears to have a preference for particular influenza subtypes, with kallikrein 5 cleaving the H1 and H3 subtypes most efficiently and kallikrein 12 cleaving the H1 and H2 subtypes most efficiently. Cleavage analysis using HA cleavage site peptide mimics revealed that the amino acids neighboring the arginine cleavage site affect cleavage efficiency. Additionally, the thrombolytic zymogens plasminogen, urokinase, and plasma kallikrein have all been shown to cleave and activate influenza but are found circulating mainly as inactive precursors. Kallikrein 5 and kallikrein 12 were examined for their ability to activate the thrombolytic zymogens, and both resulted in activation of each zymogen, with kallikrein 12 being a more potent activator. Activation of the thrombolytic zymogens may therefore allow for both direct and indirect activation of the HA of human-adapted influenza viruses by kallikrein 5 and kallikrein 12.","Hamilton, Brian S; Whittaker, Gary R",The Journal of biological chemistry,849,25

The purpose of this study was to summarize the clinical experiences and explore the risk factors for post-operative recurrence through a retrospective analysis to develop better clinical strategies for pediatric DTC. METHODS This study retrospectively analyzed children and adolescents with DTC who were treated between January 1999 and December 2014 at the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Clinicopathological results and outcomes were collected. A log-rank test of Kaplan-Meier curves and the Cox regression model were used to determine the factors associated with recurrence. RESULTS Data of 150 patients were collected in this study. During the follow-up, there was only one disease-related death. The recurrence rates at 3, 5, and 10 years were 13.6%, 18.7%, and 28.6%, respectively. There was a significant difference in the rate of recurrence according to age (P < 0.001), extrathyroidal extension (P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.023), and invasion of the trachea and esophageal wall (P = 0.004). Cox regression analysis demonstrated that age (P = 0.006) and extrathyroidal extension (P = 0.013) were significant dependent factors of post-operative recurrence. CONCLUSIONS The prognosis of DTC in children and adolescents is favorable. A close follow-up is recommended because of the high recurrence rate. A comparatively higher recurrence rate was observed in the younger age group, and new age-based divisions may be needed to conveniently evaluate the possibility of recurrence.","Wang, Xing; Wang, Xiao-Lei",Chinese medical journal,849,5

Endovascular treatment is usually performed via a transfemoral approach, but catheterization of the carotid arteries can be problematic in cases of difficult anatomy or vascular pathologies in some cases. OBJECTIVE To describe our experience with a technique involving surgical access to the carotid artery and consecutive transcarotid endovascular thrombectomy in patients with acute stroke. METHODS In a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained registry we identified 6 patients who underwent acute endovascular thrombectomy via a surgical access to the carotid artery. RESULTS Admission National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) ranged from 7 to 23. Intracranial recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction, TICI≥2b) was achieved in all patients (100%). Recanalization was achieved within 19±5 min after establishing carotid access. One patient developed a small neck hematoma, which was surgically removed without complications. No complications related to endovascular therapy were seen. At 3 months' follow-up, five patients had survived. Three patients (50%) had regained excellent neurological function (modified Rankin Scale, mRS 0-1).

PATIENTS AND METHODS This study was designed as a matched case-controlled study from our institute's RCC database. Nineteen consecutive patients who were undergoing LESS radical nephrectomy were compared with 38 patients who were undergoing conventional laparoscopic radical nephrectomy. The matching process accounted for sex, age, operative side, and tumor size. RESULTS No significant differences were observed in mean operative time (190.8 vs 172.4 min, P = 0.249), estimated blood loss (143.2 vs 199.5 mL, P = 0.235), and complication rate (15.8% vs 21.1 %, P = 0.635) between the LESS and conventional laparoscopy groups. Postoperative hospital stay after LESS radical nephrectomy was 2.7 (2-4) days, compared with 3.9 (3-7) days in the conventional laparoscopy group (P < 0.001). Postoperative pain, as measured by visual analog scale at postoperative day 1 (4.7 vs 5.8 points, P = 0.001), 2 (3.4 vs 4.6 points, P < 0.001), and 3 (2.7 vs 4.0 points, P = 0.008) was significantly lower in the LESS group.

For studies, liver tissue from cattle or pigs is often used as a substitute material. In this work, sweet potato is presented as an alternative material for microwave ablation experiments in liver due to similar material properties. Sweet potatoes as a substitute for liver have the advantages of better handling, easy procurement and stable material properties over time for microwave ablation experiments. The dielectric constant and electrical conductivity of sweet potato are characterized for temperature variation with the help of high-temperature dielectric probe. Furthermore, a test setup is presented for microwave ablation experiments in which a bowtie slot antenna matched to sweet potato is placed on its surface to directly receive the microwave power from a self-developed microwave applicator inserted into a sweet potato 4 cm below the surface antenna. A high-power source was used to excite the microwave powers up to 80 W and a spectrum analyzer was used to measure the signal received by the surface antenna. The experiments were performed in an anechoic chamber for safety reasons. Power at 50 W and 80 W was stimulated for a maximum of 600 s at the 2.45 GHz ISM band in different sweet potato experiments. A correlation is found between the power received by the surface antenna and rise of temperature inside sweet potato; relative received power drops from 1 at 76 ∘C to 0.6 at 88 ∘C (max. temperature) represents a 40% relative change in a 50 W microwave ablation experiment. The received power envelope at the surface antenna is between 10 mW and 32 mW during 50 W microwave ablation. Other important results for 10 min, 80 W microwave ablation include: a maximum ablation zone short axis diameter of 4.5 cm and a maximum ablation temperature reached at 99 ∘C, 3 mm away from the applicator's slot. The results are compared with the state of the art in microwave ablation in animal liver. The dielectric constant and electrical conductivity evolution of sweet potato with rising temperature is comparable to animal liver in 50-60 ∘C range. The reflection loss of self-developed applicator in sweet potato is below 15 dB which is equal to reflection loss in liver experiments for 600 s. The temperature rise for the first 90 s in sweet potato is 76 ∘C as compared to 73 ∘C in liver with 50 W microwave ablation. Similarly, with 80-75 W microwave ablation, for the first 60 s, the temperature is 98 ∘C in sweet potato as compared to 100 ∘C in liver. The ablation zone short-axis diameter after 600 s is 3.3 cm for 50 W microwave ablation in sweet potato as compared to 3.5 cm for 30 W microwave ablation in liver. The reasons for difference in microwave ablation results in sweet potato and animal liver are discussed. This is the first study to directly receive a signal from microwave applicator during a microwave ablation process with the help of a surface antenna. The work can be extended to multiple array antennas for microwave ablation monitoring.","Khan, Muhammad Saad; Hawlitzki, Michael; Taheri, Shadan Mofrad; Rose, Georg; Schweizer, Bernd; Brensing, Andreas",Sensors,849,31

Percutaneous tracheostomy is a well-known technique utilised as a strategy to wean critically ill patients from mechanical ventilation. Worldwide differences exist in terms of methods, operators, and settings, and questions remain regarding timing and indications. If tracheostomy is to be performed in COVID-19 patients, a safe environment is needed for optimal care. MATERIAL AND METHODS We present a guidewire dilating forceps tracheostomy procedure in COVID-19 patients that was optimised including apnoea-moments, protective clothing, checklists, and clear protocols. We performed a retrospective analysis of the outcome after tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients between March 2020 and May 2020. RESULTS The follow-up of the first 16 patients, median age 62 years, revealed a median intubation time until tracheostomy of 18 days and median cannulation time of 20 days. The overall perioperative complication rate and complication rate while cannulated was 19%, mainly superficial bleeding. None of the healthcare providers involved in performing the procedure developed any symptoms of the disease. CONCLUSIONS This COVID-19-centred strategy based on flexibility, preparation, and cooperation between healthcare providers with different backgrounds facilitated percutaneous tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients without an increase in the overall complication rate or evidence of risk to healthcare providers. Our findings provide initial evidence that tracheostomy can be performed safely as a standard of care for COVID-19 patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation as was standard practice in ICU patients prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to promote ventilator weaning and patient recovery.","Jonckheere, Wim; Mekeirele, Michaël; Hendrickx, Steven; Jonckheer, Joop; Diltoer, Marc; Ghijselings, Idris; Raes, Matthias; Vanhonacker, Domien; Malbrain, Manu L G; Foulon, Ina; Gordts, Frans; Jacobs-Tulleneers-Thevissen, Daniel; La Meir, Mark; Nijs, Jan; Smets, Dirk; Schoneveld, Martijn; Van Eetvelde, Ellen; Vanhoeij, Marian; Verbruggen, Katia; Verfaillie, Guy; Wischmeyer, Paul; De Waele, Elisabeth",Anaesthesiology intensive therapy,849,32

Qualitative data shows that patients while emphasizing the importance of the relationship with the healthcare team, had increased concerns about safety as a result of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS The experience during the COVID-19 pandemic has increased self-management-skills in some patients, but long-term follow-up is needed. It has repercussions for future shared decision making for patients and their healthcare teams.","Daly, Mary Louise; Zimmer, Andrea; Stickling, Julia; Daikeler, Thomas; Grossmann, Florian F",Pflege,849,16

However, the impact of treatment modality on seizure control remains unclear. OBJECTIVE To compare seizure control after surgical resection or radiosurgery for AVMs. METHODS We analyzed retrospectively collected information for 378 patients with cerebral AVMs treated at our institution from 1990 to 2010. The application of strict inclusion criteria resulted in a study population of 164 patients. RESULTS In our cohort, 31 patients (20.7%) had Spetzler-Martin grade I AVMs, 51 (34.0%) grade II, 47 (31.3%) grade III, 20 (13.3%) grade IV, and 1 (0.7%) grade V. Of the 49 patients (30%) presenting with seizures, 60.4% experienced seizure persistence after treatment. For these patients, radiosurgery was associated with seizure recurrence (odds ratio: 4.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.24-15.02, P = .021). AVM obliteration was predictive of seizure freedom at last follow-up (P = .002). In contrast, for patients presenting without seizures, 18.4% experienced de novo seizures after treatment, for which surgical resection was identified as an independent risk factor (hazard ratio: 8.65, 95% confidence interval: 3.05-24.5, P < .001). CONCLUSION Although our data suggest that achieving seizure freedom should not be the primary goal of AVM treatment, surgical resection may result in improved seizure control compared with radiosurgery for patients who present with seizures. Conversely, in patients without presenting seizures, surgical resection increases the risk of new-onset seizures compared with radiosurgery, but primarily within the early posttreatment period. Surgical resection and radiosurgery result in divergent seizure control rates depending on seizure presentation.","Wang, Joanna Y; Yang, Wuyang; Ye, Xiaobu; Rigamonti, Daniele; Coon, Alexander L; Tamargo, Rafael J; Huang, Judy",Neurosurgery,849,1

Patients and Methods A total of 25 MM patient samples and 15 healthy volunteer samples were collected, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed to detect the expressions of LINC00665. PSMD10 and ASF1B expressions were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot assays. U266 cell and H929 cell were used in functional experiments. Besides, CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry analysis were utilized to determine cell proliferation and apoptosis. Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to predict and verify the targeting relationships between LINC00665 and miR-214-3p, PSMD10 and miR-214-3p, as well as ASF1B and miR-214-3p. Moreover, the regulatory function of LINC00665 on the expression of PSMD10 and ASF1B was detected by Western blot. Results The expression of LINC00665 was up-regulated in MM samples and cell lines. In vitro functional assays indicated that LINC00665 enhanced MM cell proliferation and inhibited its apoptosis. PSMD10 and ASF1B were identified as target genes of miR-214-3p. Additionally, LINC00665 negatively regulated miR-214-3p expression through sponging miR-214-3p and positively regulated PSMD10 and ASF1B. Conclusion LINC00665 can promote the expression of PSMD10 and ASF1B by inhibiting the expression of miR-214-3p, thus facilitating the proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis of MM cells.","Wang, Chong; Li, Mengya; Wang, Shujuan; Jiang, Zhongxing; Liu, Yanfang",OncoTargets and therapy,849,16

The main causes of sHLH are infections and hematological malignancies, especially non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Despite new insights into the pathogenesis of HLH, the diagnosis and treatment of this immune disorder remain a great challenge. CASE REPORT We present a case of a young adult without comorbidities whose clinical course was nonspecific for several months and resulted in late diagnosis of HLH secondary to peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). The etiological factor of recurring fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and deteriorating condition was unidentified for a long time before fatal sHLH was finally diagnosed. The patient was treated according to the HLH-2004 protocol; however, he did not achieve any response. Unfortunately, due to nonspecific symptoms, lack of lymphadenopathy for a long time, and negative positron emission tomography results, the diagnosis of PTCL was established only after the patient's death. CONCLUSIONS It should be emphasized that early diagnosis is crucial for better prognosis of patients with sHLH. Bone marrow biopsy is worth considering in patients with prolonged fever of unknown origin, hyperferritinemia, splenomegaly, and unexplained cytopenia of 2 or more lineages. Despite the existence of diagnostic and therapeutic protocols available in the literature, the prompt diagnosis and treatment of HLH remains a great challenge. More precise and specific diagnostic tools for HLH are needed.","Paluszkiewicz, Patrycja; Martuszewski, Adrian; Majcherek, Maciej; Kucharska, Marta; Bogucka-Fedorczuk, Aleksandra; Wróbel, Tomasz; Czyż, Anna",The American journal of case reports,849,1

So far, it is not known to what extent different devices display similar index values while processing identical electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. OBJECTIVE To compare BIS and state entropy during analysis of identical EEG data. Inspection of raw EEG input to detect potential causes of erroneous index calculation. DESIGN Offline re-analysis of EEG data from a randomised, single-centre controlled trial using the Entropy Module and an Aspect A-2000 monitor. SETTING Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universität München, Munich. PATIENTS Forty adult patients undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia. INTERVENTIONS Blocked randomisation of 20 patients per anaesthetic group (sevoflurane/remifentanil or propofol/remifentanil). Isolated forearm technique for differentiation between consciousness and unconsciousness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prediction probability (PK) of state entropy to discriminate consciousness from unconsciousness. Correlation and agreement between state entropy and BIS from deep to light hypnosis. Analysis of raw EEG compared with index values that are in conflict with clinical examination, with frequency measures (frequency bands/Spectral Edge Frequency 95) and visual inspection for physiological EEG patterns (e.g. beta or delta arousal), pathophysiological features such as high-frequency signals (electromyogram/high-frequency EEG or eye fluttering/saccades), different types of electro-oculogram or epileptiform EEG and technical artefacts. RESULTS PK of state entropy was 0.80 and of BIS 0.84; correlation coefficient of state entropy with BIS 0.78. Nine percent BIS and 14% state entropy values disagreed with clinical examination. Highest incidence of disagreement occurred after state transitions, in particular for state entropy after loss of consciousness during sevoflurane anaesthesia. EEG sequences which led to false 'conscious' index values often showed high-frequency signals and eye blinks. High-frequency EEG/electromyogram signals were pooled because a separation into EEG and fast electro-oculogram, for example eye fluttering or saccades, on the basis of a single EEG channel may not be very reliable. These signals led to higher Spectral Edge Frequency 95 and ratio of relative beta and gamma band power than EEG signals, indicating adequate unconscious classification. The frequency of other artefacts that were assignable, for example technical artefacts, movement artefacts, was negligible and they were excluded from analysis. CONCLUSION High-frequency signals and eye blinks may account for index values that falsely indicate consciousness. Compared with BIS, state entropy showed more false classifications of the clinical state at transition between consciousness and unconsciousness.","Pilge, Stefanie; Kreuzer, Matthias; Karatchiviev, Veliko; Kochs, Eberhard F; Malcharek, Michael; Schneider, Gerhard",European journal of anaesthesiology,849,1

In response to environmental cues, the BvgAS regulatory system controls expression of a spectrum of phenotypic phases, transitioning between a virulent (Bvg(+)) phase and a nonvirulent (Bvg(-)) phase, a process referred to as phenotypic modulation. We hypothesized that the ability of Bordetella bronchiseptica to undergo phenotypic modulation is required at one or more points during the infectious cycle in swine. To investigate the Bvg phase-dependent contribution to pathogenesis of B. bronchiseptica in swine, we constructed a series of isogenic mutants in a virulent B. bronchiseptica swine isolate and compared each mutant to the wild-type isolate for its ability to colonize and cause disease. We additionally tested whether a BvgAS system capable of modulation is required for direct or indirect transmission. The Bvg(-) phase-locked mutant was never recovered from any respiratory tract site at any time point examined. An intermediate phase-locked mutant (Bvg(i)) was found in numbers lower than the wild type at all respiratory tract sites and time points examined and caused limited to no disease. In contrast, colonization of the respiratory tract and disease caused by the Bvg(+) phase-locked mutant and the wild-type strain were indistinguishable. The Bvg(+) phase-locked mutant transmitted to naïve pigs by both direct and indirect contact with efficiency equal to that of the wild-type isolate. These results indicate that while full activation of the BvgAS regulatory system is required for colonization and severe disease, it is not deleterious to direct and indirect transmission. Overall, our results demonstrate that the Bvg(+) phase is sufficient for respiratory infection and host-to-host transmission of B. bronchiseptica in swine.","Nicholson, Tracy L; Brockmeier, Susan L; Loving, Crystal L; Register, Karen B; Kehrli, Marcus E; Stibitz, Scott E; Shore, Sarah M",Infection and immunity,849,1

However, this therapy has been scarcely studied in kidney transplant (KT) recipients. Herein, we describe the clinical course and outcome of 10 KT patients with severe Covid-19 that were treated with TCZ. Mean age of the study group was 54±10 years (70% females) and 30% of the cases were within 6 months from transplant. Mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued in all cases upon admission, whereas baseline steroids were maintained and tacrolimus dose was reduced. Initial treatment included hydroxychloroquine, antibiotics and prophylactic anticoagulation. Before treatment with TCZ, 3 patients were receiving high-flow oxygen, 4 patients low-flow oxygen and 1 case non-invasive ventilation. All patients received a single dose of intravenous TCZ within a mean time of 7±4 days since admission. During a median follow-up of 16 days (IQR 10-29), 7 patients (70%) gradually improved and were finally discharged while 3 cases (30%) did not exhibited clinical improvement and ultimately died.

Despite recent advancements in the development of ABI clinical practice guidelines, recommendations for specific clinical processes and actions to attain adequate oral care often lack information. OBJECTIVE This systematic review will (1) identify relevant ABI clinical practice guidelines and (2) appraise the oral care recommendations existing in the selected guidelines. METHODS A search strategy was developed based on a recent systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for ABI. The protocol includes a search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and DynaMed Plus databases, as well as organizational and best-practice websites and reference lists of accepted guidelines. Search terms will include medical subject headings and user-defined terms. Guideline appraisal will involve the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II ratings, followed by a descriptive synopsis for oral care recommendations according to the National Health and Medical Research Council evidence levels. RESULTS This project started in April 2019, when we developed the search strategy. The preliminary search of databases and websites yielded 863 and 787 citations, respectively, for a total of 1650 citations.

This study was designed to assess the expression of different growth factors (VEGF/TGF-β1) and macrophages during the early host tissue incorporation of several polypropylene lightweight (PP-LW)-including one partially absorbable-and heavyweight (PP-HW) prosthetic meshes. METHODS Ventral defects were created in the anterior abdominal wall of New Zealand rabbits and repaired by fixing PP-LW meshes of different pore size and a low porosity PP-HW mesh to the edges of the defect. Following killing 14 days after implant, specimens were taken to examine TGF-β1/VEGF gene and protein expression by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The macrophage response was also assessed. RESULTS All the materials showed good host tissue incorporation, with a more severe inflammatory reaction and greater numbers of macrophages recorded in the partially absorbable LW implants. Relative amounts of VEGF mRNA were significantly lower for the LW partially absorbable implants compared with the remaining LW meshes. Protein expression of VEGF showed undetectable or minimum staining in the different groups. TGF-β1 mRNA levels were also lower in the partially absorbable group compared with one of PP-LW type of mesh. Gene expression patterns were consistent with the TGF-β1 protein levels detected. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that VEGF and TGF-β1 expression were independent of mesh pore size. The expression of both growth factors and the macrophage response were correlated with the presence of biodegradable material in the mesh. The presence of absorbable material in the LW mesh gave rise to a more intense inflammatory reaction and the reduced synthesis of growth factors known to contribute to neotissue maturation.","Pascual, G; Rodríguez, M; Sotomayor, S; Pérez-Köhler, B; Bellón, J M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,849,17

Patient and peri-operative variables associated with increased risk of post-craniotomy hypertension and complications are not well understood. Our analysis aims to estimate the incidence and prevalence of post-craniotomy hypertension, its time course, contributing factors, and post-craniotomy complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS This is a prospective study of patients admitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit after an elective craniotomy. Variables associated with pre-surgical risk, demographics, and post-operative care were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 282 patients were included in the final analysis, 44% had pre-existing hypertension. Post-craniotomy hypertension was seen in 21%, with a higher incidence in patients with pre-existing hypertension (p < .001), smaller craniotomies (p = .0035), and increased use of analgesic medications (p < .001). History of hypertension was the only independent risk factor for post-craniotomy hypertension in a multivariate regression model. Patients who developed post-craniotomy hypertension, showed a significant increase in length of stay, number and duration of antihypertensive treatment. However, post-craniotomy hypertension was not associated with a higher incidence of other post-operative complications. CONCLUSIONS Development of hypertension after craniotomy is multi-factorial. In this prospective study, a prior history of hypertension was the only associated independent risk factor.","Perez, Claudia A; Stutzman, Sonja; Jansen, Taylore; Perera, Anjali; Jannusch, Sarah; Atem, Folefac; Aiyagari, Venkatesh",Journal of critical care,849,1

METHODS We purposively sampled and interviewed practice staff (eg, office managers, clinicians) from a subset of 104 practices participating in EvidenceNOW-a multisite cardiovascular disease prevention initiative. We calculated Clinical Quality Measure improvements, with targets of 10-point or greater absolute improvements in the proportion of patients with smoking screening and, if relevant, counseling and in the proportion of hypertensive patients with adequately controlled BP. We analyzed interview data to identify operational changes, transforming these into numeric data. We used Configurational Comparative Methods to assess the joint effects of multiple factors on outcomes. RESULTS In clinician-owned practices, implementing a workflow to routinely screen, counsel, and connect patients to smoking cessation resources, or implementing a documentation change or a referral to a resource alone led to an improvement of at least 10 points in the smoking outcome with a moderate level of facilitation support. These patterns did not manifest in health- or hospital system-owned practices or in Federally Qualified Health Centers, however. The BP outcome improved by at least 10 points among solo practices after medical assistants were trained to take an accurate BP. Among larger, clinician-owned practices, BP outcomes improved when practices implemented a second BP measurement when the first was elevated, and when staff learned where to document this information in the electronic health record. With 50 hours or more of facilitation, BP outcomes improved among larger and health- and hospital system-owned practices that implemented these operational changes. CONCLUSIONS There was no magic bullet for improving smoking or BP outcomes. Multiple combinations of operational changes led to improvements, but only in specific contexts of practice size and ownership, or dose of external facilitation.","Cohen, Deborah J; Sweeney, Shannon M; Miller, William L; Hall, Jennifer D; Miech, Edward J; Springer, Rachel J; Balasubramanian, Bijal A; Damschroder, Laura; Marino, Miguel",Annals of family medicine,849,1

Methodology: Patients with CF over 12 years-old and caregivers of children with CF from 0 to 18 years-old performed an online MH screening using two validated questionnaires: PHQ9 and GAD7. Results: 96 people participated in the study: 7.3% (n7) adolescents, 19.8% (n19) adult patients, 43.7% (n42) mothers and 29.2% (n28) fathers of CF patients.

The mechanisms of this infection tolerance and the trade-off costs are poorly understood. We used exposure to a single dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin as an experimental model of inflammation to compare the responses of the cricentine rodent Peromyscus leucopus, the white-footed deermouse, to that of Mus musculus, the standard laboratory model for pathogenesis studies. Four hours after injection with either LPS or saline, blood and spleen and liver tissues were collected postmortem and subjected to RNA-seq, untargeted metabolomics, and specific RT-qPCR. This was followed by analysis of differential expression at the gene, pathway, and empirical network levels. The deermice showed the same signs of sickness as the mice with LPS exposure, and in addition demonstrated comparable increases in levels of corticosterone and expression of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor, IL-1β, and acute phase reactants, including C-reactive protein. But whereas the M. musculus response to LPS was best-characterized by network analysis as cytokine-associated, the P. leucopus response was dominated by pathway terms associated with neutrophil activity. Dichotomies between the species in expression profiles of arginase 1 and nitric oxide synthase 2, as well as the ratios of IL-10 to IL-12, were consistent with a type M1 polarized macrophage response in the mice and a type M2 or alternatively-activated response in the deermice. Analysis of metabolites in the plasma and RNA in the tissues revealed differences between the two species in tryptophan metabolism during response to LPS. Two up-regulated genes in particular signified the difference between the species: Slpi (secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor) and Ibsp (integrin-binding protein sialoprotein). The latter was previously unrecognized in the context of inflammation or infection. Key RNA-seq findings in P. leucopus were replicated in a second LPS experiment with older animals, in a systemic bacterial infection model, and with cultivated fibroblasts. Taken together, the results indicate that the deermouse possesses several adaptive traits to moderate effects of inflammation and oxidative stress ensuing from infection. This seems to be at the cost of infection persistence and that is to the benefit of the pathogen.","Balderrama-Gutierrez, Gabriela; Milovic, Ana; Cook, Vanessa J.; Islam, M.

What are the themes in CG in the COVID-19 era? and What are key areas of future research on CG and COVID-19?Design/methodology/approachThe authors attempted a systematic literature review of 62 studies published in 2020. The authors used four criteria to identify characteristics of the literature on CG and COVID-19 and three criteria to identify key themes in the literature addressing CG and the pandemic. The authors analyzed answers to the above research questions and proposals from studies reviewed to guide future research.FindingsCG in the context of COVID-19 has been studied mostly in developed countries and within a theoretical framework. As accounting data are insufficient, more research is required in all countries (developed, emerging and other). Further, there are no conclusive results regarding the relevance of ESG and CSR to financial performance. Future research should use additional methodologies and data sources to fully explain the impact of COVID-19 on CG.Practical implicationsPractitioners and policymakers could benefit from the study, as the authors present key challenges to CG for the present and the future.Originality/valueThis study is the first to provide a systematic literature review on CG during the COVID-19 pandemic and presents current trends, challenges and avenues for future research.","Koutoupis, Andreas Kyriakogkonas Panagiotis Pazarskis Michail Davidopoulos Leonidas",Corporate Governance,849,19

In particular, the recent restrictions in transportation from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic are making people more interested in these virtual experiences. However, to minimize the differences between artificial and natural perception, more human‐interactive and human‐like devices are necessary. The skin is the largest organ of the human body and interacts with the environment as the site of interfacing and sensing. Recent progress in skin electronics has enabled the use of the skin as the mounting object of functional devices and the signal pathway bridging humans and computers, with opening its potential in future VR and AR applications. In this review, the current skin electronics are summarized as one of the most promising device solutions for future VR/AR devices, especially focusing on the recent materials and structures. After defining and explaining VR/AR systems and the components, the advantages of skin electronics for VR/AR applications are emphasized. Next, the detailed functionalities of skin electronic devices, including the input, output, energy devices, and integrated systems, are reviewed for future VR/AR applications.

The exact animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains obscure and understanding its host range is vital for preventing interspecies transmission. Previously, we have assessed the target cell profiles of SARS-CoV-2 in pets, livestock, poultry and wild animals. Herein, we expand this investigation to a wider range of animal species and viruses to provide a comprehensive source for large-scale screening of potential virus hosts. Single cell atlas for several mammalian species (alpaca, hamster, hedgehog, chinchilla etc.), as well as comparative atlas for lung, brain and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for various lineages of animals were constructed, from which we systemically analyzed the virus entry factors for 113 viruses over 20 species from mammalians, birds, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates. Conserved cellular connectomes and regulomes were also identified, revealing the fundamental cell-cell and gene-gene cross-talks between these species. Overall, our study could help identify the potential host range and tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and a diverse set of viruses and reveal the host-virus co-evolution footprints.","Chen, Dongsheng; Ou, Zhihua; Zhu, Jiacheng; Ding, Peiwen; Wang, Haoyu; Luo, Lihua; Ding, Xiangning; Lan, Tianming; Wu, Weiying; Yuan, Yuting; Wu, Wendi; Qiu, Jiaying; Zhu, Yixin; Jia, Yi; Wei, Yanan; Qin, Qiuyu; Li, Runchu; Sun, Chengcheng; Zhao, Wandong; Lv, Zhiyuan; Pu, Mingyi; Yang, Shangchen; Chang, Ashley; Wei, Xiaofeng; Chen, Fengzhen; Yang, Tao; Wei, Zhenyong; Yang, Fan; Li, Yuejiao; Hua, Yan; Liu, Huan",bioRxiv,849,1

Despite South Africa’s laudable human rights commitments to mental health in law, perinatal women are at high risk of common mental disorders due to socioeconomic factors, and they may lack access to mental health services. We used a right to mental health framework, paired with qualitative methods, to investigate barriers to accessing perinatal mental health care. Based on in-depth interviews with 14 key informants in South Africa, we found that (1) physical health was prioritized over mental health at the clinic level; (2) there were insufficient numbers of antenatal and mental health providers to ensure minimum essential levels of perinatal mental health services; (3) the implementation of human rights-based mental health policy has been inadequate; (4) the social determinants were absent from the clinic-level approach to mental health; and (5) a lack of context-specific provider training and support has undermined the quality of mental health promotion and care. We offer recommendations to address these barriers and improve approaches to perinatal mental health screening and care, guided by the following elements of the right to mental health: progressive realization; availability and accessibility; and acceptability and quality.","Brown, Shelley; MacNaughton, Gillian; Sprague, Courtenay",Health Hum Rights,849,30

In particular, it is technically difficult to cut the distal rectum from the umbilicus using an articulating linear stapler in single-incision laparoscopic anterior resection. TECHNIQUE After treating the mesorectum, the 5-mm trocar is replaced with a 12-mm trocar. The cartridge of the curved stapler is mounted while the shaft of the stapler is inserted into the 12-mm port extracorporeally. The curved stapler is inserted through the umbilical incision with the cartridge. A multichannel port is then mounted, and the abdominal cavity is reinsufflated. The curved stapler can then be operated intracorporeally. This procedure facilitates the vertical dissection of the rectum from the umbilicus. RESULTS A total of 27 consecutive patients were analyzed in this study. All the procedures were safely performed without any complications. The median distance from the peritoneal reflection to the transection point of the distal bowel in single-incision laparoscopic anterior resection was 5.0 cm (range, -2.0 to 15.0). One stapler firing was required to achieve distal bowel division in 26 patients (96.3 %), whereas 2 firings were required in 1 patient (3.7 %). The median distal margin was 7.0 cm (range, 3.0-13.0). The time from the insertion of the stapler to transection was 180 seconds (range, 100-420). There were no cases of anastomotic leakage. CONCLUSIONS In single-incision laparoscopic anterior resection, it is feasible to perform rectal transection from the umbilicus by using a curved stapler. This technique may allow for the omission of 1 trocar from the operation.","Watanabe, Jun; Ota, Mitsuyoshi; Suwa, Yusuke; Ishibe, Atsushi; Masui, Hidenobu; Nagahori, Kaoru",Diseases of the colon and rectum,849,19

Clinicians demand a diagnostic test with high sensitivity that is applicable during the early symptomatic phase. We aimed to test two distinct molecular methods on samples from suspected dengue cases during an outbreak in Central Brazil. Acute-phase serum specimens from 254 patients suspected of having dengue were collected during 2005 in the city of Goiânia, Central Brazil. Samples were blindly evaluated by real-time and multiplex PCR in addition to routine immunoglobulin M serology and virus culture. Overall, acute dengue was confirmed by serology, multiplex PCR, or virus isolation for 80% of patients (203/254). Another four patients presented real-time PCR-positive results as the unique marker of dengue. Higher real-time PCR positivity levels and viral loads were observed in the early symptomatic phase of disease (< or =5 days) than after this period. Multiplex and real-time PCR assays presented a high kappa agreement (0.85). According to multiplex PCR, 60 samples harbored dengue virus type 3 (DEN-3), 4 samples harbored DEN-2, and 1 sample displayed a pattern compatible with a double infection with DEN-2 and -3. The dengue virus real-time kit was found to be practical and adjustable for high throughput, to display the best performance in the early symptomatic phase of dengue cases, and to be valuable for confirming dengue diagnosis in a timely manner.","Levi, José Eduardo; Tateno, Adriana Fumie; Machado, Adriana Freire; Ramalho, Débora Camillo; de Souza, Vanda Akico Ueda Fick; Guilarde, Adriana Oliveira; de Rezende Feres, Valéria Christina; Martelli, Celina Maria Turchi; Turchi, Marília Dalva; Siqueira, João Bosco; Pannuti, Cláudio Sérgio",Journal of clinical microbiology,849,5

We carried out a sequence comparison of 1,000 HIV-1 sequences at the slippery site (UUUUUUA) and found that the site is invariant, which is somewhat surprising for a virus known for its variability. This prompted us to prepare a series of mutations to examine their effect upon frameshifting and viral infectivity. Among the series of mutations were changes of the HIV-1 slippery site to those effectively utilized by other viruses, because such mutations would be anticipated to have a relatively mild effect upon frameshifting. The results demonstrate that any change to the slippery site reduced frameshifting levels and also dramatically inhibited infectivity. Because ribosomal frameshifting is essential for HIV-1 replication and it is surprisingly resistant to mutation, modulation of HIV-1 frameshifting efficiency potentially represents an important target for the development of novel antiviral therapeutics.","Biswas, Preetha; Jiang, Xi; Pacchia, Annmarie L; Dougherty, Joseph P; Peltz, Stuart W",Journal of virology,849,1

This defined portions of the two N proteins that, despite evolutionary divergence, have remained functionally equivalent. These regions included most of the centrally located RNA-binding domain and two putative spacers that link the three domains of the N protein. By contrast, the amino terminus of N, the acidic carboxy-terminal domain, and a serine- and arginine-rich segment of the central domain could not be transferred from bovine coronavirus to MHV, presumably because these parts of the molecule participate in protein-protein interactions that are specific for each virus (or, possibly, each host). Our results demonstrate that targeted recombination can be used to make extensive substitutions in the coronavirus genome and can generate recombinants that could not otherwise be made between two viruses separated by a species barrier. The implications of these findings for N protein structure and function as well as for coronavirus RNA recombination are discussed.","Peng, D; Koetzner, C A; McMahon, T; Zhu, Y; Masters, P S",Journal of virology,849,19

Though, more than 1000 publications have appeared in scientific journals addressing a plethora of questions, there is a considerable hiatus in understanding of the behavior and natural history of the virus and its impact on urology. Also, a modified approach is the need of hour in taking care of patients as urologists should safeguard their teams, families, and patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS The authors have used guidelines from USA, Canada, UK, Europe and India for making recommendations to help urologist define their own policies that may have to be fine-tuned on the basis of continued and evolving challenges they would encounter and the local resources at their disposal. RESULTS COVID-19 do effect genitourinary system from kidney to testis. The authors provide scientific basis to urologists to help identify patients by remote consultation who are likely to be harmed by coming to the hospital, and not to miss those who need hospitalization for diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. There is uncompromised need of specific precautions during surgery to safe guard the surgeon and his team along with the patient.

The 3a gene encodes a non-structural viral protein, which is predicted to be a transmembrane protein. In this study, it was shown that the 3a protein was expressed in the lungs and intestinal tissues of SARS patients and that the protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in 3a-transfected monkey kidney Vero E6 cells.

These events can be caused by a large number of infectious and noninfectious agents and are associated with an increased local and systemic inflammatory response. Their frequency and severity have been linked to progressive deterioration in lung function and health status. Infectious pathogens ranging from viral to atypical and typical bacteria have been implicated in the majority of episodes. Most therapeutic regimens to date have emphasized broad, nonspecific approaches to bronchoconstriction and pulmonary inflammation. Increasingly, therapy that targets specific etiologic pathogens has been advocated. These include clinical and laboratory-based methods to identify bacterial infections. Further additional investigation has suggested specific pathogens within this broad class. As specific antiviral therapies become available, better diagnostic approaches to identify specific pathogens will be required. Furthermore, prophylactic therapy for at-risk individuals during high-risk times may become a standard therapeutic approach. As such, the future will likely include aggressive diagnostic algorithms based on the combination of clinical syndromes and rapid laboratory modalities to identify specific causative bacteria or viruses.","Martinez, Fernando J",Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society,849,33

This status changed dramatically with the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002/2003. The SARS-CoV pandemic took 774 lives around the globe and infected more than 8000 people in 29 countries. SARS-CoV is believed to be of zoonotic origin, transmitted from its natural reservoir in bats through several animal species (e.g., civet cats, raccoon dogs sold for human consumption in markets in southern China). The epidemic was halted in 2003 by a highly effective global public health response, and SARS-CoV is currently not circulating in humans. The outbreak of SARS-CoV and the danger of its re-introduction into the human population, as well as the danger of the emergence of other zoonotic coronaviral infections triggered an intense survey for an efficient treatment that resulted in the evaluation of several anticoronaviral compounds. HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were identified shortly after the SARS-CoV outbreak. The 4 human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 cause mild respiratory illnesses when compared to SARS, but these infections are involved in 10 - 20 % of hospitalizations of young children and immunocompromised adults with respiratory tract illness. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a successful therapy to prevent disease induction or a vaccine to prevent new infections. This review summarizes the current status of anticoronaviral strategies.","Pyrc, K; Berkhout, B; van der Hoek, L",Infectious disorders drug targets,849,26

In asthma, this function may be dangerously exaggerated because of the presence of unusually viscous airway secretions and the remodelling of airway walls.","Blyth, D I",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,849,24

Vaccines and targeted therapeutics to prevent infections and stop virus proliferation are currently lacking. Endoribonuclease Nsp15 plays a vital role in the life cycle, including replication and transcription as well as virulence of the virus. Here, we investigated Vitamin D for its in silico potential inhibition of the binding sites of SARS-CoV-2 endoribonuclease Nsp15. In this study, we selected Remdesivir, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine and Vitamin D to study the potential binding affinity with the putative binding sites of endoribonuclease Nsp15 of COVID-19. The docking study was applied to rationalize the possible interactions of the target compounds with the active site of endoribonuclease Nsp 15. Among the results, Vitamin D was found to have the highest potency with strongest interaction in terms of LBE, lowest RMSD, and lowest inhibition intensity Ki than the other standard compounds. The investigation results of endoribonuclease Nsp15 on the PrankWeb server showed that there are three prospective binding sites with the ligands. The singularity of Vitamin D interaction with the three pockets, particularly in the second pocket, may write down Vitamin D as a potential inhibitor of COVID-19 Nsp15 endoribonuclease binding sites and favour addition of Vitamin D in the treatment plan for COVID-19 alone or in combination with the other used drugs in this purpose, which deserves exploration in further in vitro and in vivo studies.","Shalayel, Mohammed H; Al-Mazaideh, Ghassab M; Aladaileh, Saleem H; Al-Swailmi, Farhan K; Al-Thiabat, Mohammad G",Pakistan journal of pharmaceutical sciences,849,1
198516,198516,198516,The crystal structures of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus main protease and its complex with an inhibitor.,7.1385574,6.507428,2003,"The aims of this study were to validate a colorimetric method to measure total sialic acid (TSA) in feline serum and to investigate the serum concentration of TSA in clinically healthy cats seronegative (n = 9) and seropositive (n = 48) for feline coronavirus (FCoV), and in cats affected by feline infectious peritonitis (FIP, n = 28), tumors (n = 20), or inflammation (n = 16). The correlation between TSA and alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP) was also investigated. The method employed in this study is precise and accurate at TSA levels (in mg/L) commonly encountered in feline serum. No significant differences between seropositive (385.6 +/- 192.2 mg/L) and seronegative (433.5 +/- 179.0 mg/L) cats were detectable, suggesting that the simple infection by FCoVs does not influence TSA levels. Compared with seropositive controls, the concentration of TSA was higher in cats with FIP (556.7 +/- 268.3 mg/L, P = 0.003), tumors (522.5 +/- 294.4 mg/L, P = 0.028), and inflammation (546.8 +/- 208.3 mg/L, P = 0.018). The discriminating power of TSA for FIP is moderate (area under the ROC curve = 0.65) and the likelihood ratio is higher than 3.0 only at high TSA levels. Consequently, TSA could support a diagnosis of FIP only at extremely high serum concentration (> 800 mg/L) or when the pre-test probability of FIP is high. No correlations were found between the TSA and AGP concentrations in cats with FIP, suggesting that sialylated proteins other than AGP are present. Both the antibody titre and the degree of AGP sialylation were negatively correlated with TSA levels, suggesting that increased TSA may contribute to reduce the burden of FCoVs.","Rossi, Gabriele; Paltrinieri, Saverio",Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,849,8

Infection of the murine central nervous system (CNS) with a neurotropic coronavirus induces encephalitis associated with increased levels of mRNA encoding MMP-3 and MMP-12. Whereas virus-induced MMP-3 expression was restricted to CNS resident astrocytes, MMP-12 mRNA was expressed by both inflammatory cells and CNS resident cells. Immunosuppression increased both MMP-3 and MMP-12 mRNA levels in CNS resident cells, suggesting that the presence of virus rather than inflammation induced protease up-regulation. MMP activity is partially regulated by a small family of genes encoding tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs); among the TIMPs, only TIMP-1 mRNA expression increased in the CNS following coronavirus infection. During inflammation TIMP-1 mRNA was most prominently expressed by infiltrating cells. By contrast, in the immunosuppressed host TIMP-1 mRNA was expressed by CNS resident cells. Analysis of cytokine and chemokine mRNA induction within the infected CNS of healthy and immunocompromised mice suggested a possible correlation between increased viral replication and increased levels of beta interferon, MMP-3, MMP-12, and TIMP-1 mRNA. CD4+ T cells which localize to the perivascular and subarachnoid spaces were identified as the primary source of TIMP-1 protein. By contrast, protein expression was undetectable in astrocytes or CD8+ T cells, the primary antiviral effectors that localize to the CNS parenchyma in response to infection. These data suggest that in contrast to the results seen with MMPs, inhibition of protease activity via TIMP-1 expression correlates with the differential tissue distribution of T-cell subsets during acute coronavirus-induced encephalitis.","Zhou, Jiehao; Marten, Norman W; Bergmann, Cornelia C; Macklin, Wendy B; Hinton, David R; Stohlman, Stephen A",Journal of virology,849,17

Importantly, CVD, as one of the comorbidities, could also increase the risks of the severity of COVID-19. Here we identified phospholipase A2 group VII (PLA2G7), a well-studied CVD biomarker, as a hub gene in COVID-19 though an integrated hypothesis-free genomic analysis on nasal swabs (n = 486) from patients with COVID-19. PLA2G7 was further found to be predominantly expressed by proinflammatory macrophages in lungs emerging with progression of COVID-19. In the validation stage, RNA level of PLA2G7 was identified in nasal swabs from both COVID-19 and pneumonia patients, other than health individuals. The positive rate of PLA2G7 were correlated with not only viral loads but also severity of pneumonia in non-COVID-19 patients. Serum protein levels of PLA2G7 were found to be elevated and beyond the normal limit in COVID-19 patients, especially among those re-positive patients. We identified and validated PLA2G7, a biomarker for CVD, was abnormally enhanced in COVID-19 at both nucleotide and protein aspects. These findings provided indications into the prevalence of cardiovascular involvements seen in patients with COVID-19.
