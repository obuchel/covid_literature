239,239,239,A multidimensional classification of public health activity in Australia,20.358543,0.97585714,2009-04-09,"BACKGROUND: At present, we have very limited ability to compare public health activity across jurisdictions and countries, or even to ascertain differences in what is considered to be a public health activity. Existing standardised health classifications do not capture important dimensions of public health, which include its functions, the methods and interventions used to achieve these, the health issues and determinants of health that public health activities address, the resources and infrastructure they use, and the settings in which they occur. A classification that describes these dimensions will promote consistency in collecting and reporting information about public health programs, expenditure, workforce and performance. This paper describes the development of an initial version of such a classification. METHODS: We used open-source Protégé software and published procedures to construct an ontology of public health, which forms the basis of the classification. We reviewed existing definitions of public health, descriptions of public health functions and classifications to develop the scope, domain, and multidimensional class structure of the ontology. These were then refined through a series of consultations with public health experts from across Australia, culminating in an initial classification framework. RESULTS: The public health classification consists of six top-level classes: public health 'Functions'; 'Health Issues'; 'Determinants of Health'; 'Settings'; 'Methods' of intervention; and 'Resources and Infrastructure'. Existing classifications (such as the international classifications of diseases, disability and functioning and external causes of injuries) can be used to further classify large parts of the classes 'Health Issues', 'Settings' and 'Resources and Infrastructure', while new subclass structures are proposed for the classes of public health 'Functions', 'Determinants of Health' and 'Interventions'. CONCLUSION: The public health classification captures the important dimensions of public health activity. It will facilitate the organisation of information so that it can be used to address questions relating to any of these dimensions, either singly or in combination. The authors encourage readers to use the classification, and to suggest improvements.","Jorm, Louisa; Gruszin, Su; Churches, Tim",Aust New Zealand Health Policy,117,30

802,802,802,The impact of media coverage on the transmission dynamics of human influenza,20.369225,0.96493655,2011-02-25,"BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need to understand how the provision of information influences individual risk perception and how this in turn shapes the evolution of epidemics. Individuals are influenced by information in complex and unpredictable ways. Emerging infectious diseases, such as the recent swine flu epidemic, may be particular hotspots for a media-fueled rush to vaccination; conversely, seasonal diseases may receive little media attention, despite their high mortality rate, due to their perceived lack of newness. METHODS: We formulate a deterministic transmission and vaccination model to investigate the effects of media coverage on the transmission dynamics of influenza. The population is subdivided into different classes according to their disease status. The compartmental model includes the effect of media coverage on reporting the number of infections as well as the number of individuals successfully vaccinated. RESULTS: A threshold parameter (the basic reproductive ratio) is analytically derived and used to discuss the local stability of the disease-free steady state. The impact of costs that can be incurred, which include vaccination, education, implementation and campaigns on media coverage, are also investigated using optimal control theory. A simplified version of the model with pulse vaccination shows that the media can trigger a vaccinating panic if the vaccine is imperfect and simplified messages result in the vaccinated mixing with the infectives without regard to disease risk. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of media on an outbreak are complex. Simplified understandings of disease epidemiology, propogated through media soundbites, may make the disease significantly worse.","Tchuenche, Jean M; Dube, Nothabo; Bhunu, Claver P; Smith?, Robert J; Bauch, Chris T",BMC Public Health,117,30
1028,1028,1028,Wearing face masks in public during the influenza season may reflect other positive hygiene practices in Japan,20.377407,0.46201646,2012-12-10,"BACKGROUND: Although the wearing of face masks in public has not been recommended for preventing influenza, these devices are often worn in many Asian countries during the influenza season. In Japan, it is thought that such behavior may be an indicator of other positive hygiene practices. The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine if wearing a face mask in public is associated with other positive hygiene practices and health behaviors among Japanese adults. METHODS: We initially recruited around 3,000 Japanese individuals ranging from 20 to 69 years of age who were registered with a web survey company. Participants were asked to recall their personal hygiene practices during the influenza season of the previous year. Logistic regression analysis was then used to examine the associations between wearing a face mask in public and personal hygiene practices and health behaviors. RESULTS: A total of 3,129 persons responded to the survey, among whom 38% reported that they had worn a face mask in public during the previous influenza season. Wearing a face mask in public was associated with various self-reported hygiene practices including: frequent hand washing (adjusted Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.67; 95% Confidence Interval [95%CI]: 1.34-1.96), occasional hand washing (OR: 1.43; 95%CI: 1.10-1.75), frequently avoiding crowds (OR: 1.85; 95%CI: 1.70-1.98), occasionally avoiding crowds (OR: 1.65; 95%CI: 1.53-1.76), frequent gargling (OR: 1.68; 95%CI: 1.51-1.84), occasional gargling (OR: 1.46; 95%CI: 1.29-1.62), regularly avoiding close contact with an infected person (OR: 1.50; 95%CI: 1.33-1.67), occasionally avoiding close contact with an infected person (OR: 1.31; 95%CI: 1.16-1.46), and being vaccinated of influenza in the last season (OR: 1.31; 95%CI: 1.17-1.45). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study suggests that wearing a face mask in public may be associated with other personal hygiene practices and health behaviors among Japanese adults. Rather than preventing influenza itself, face mask use might instead be a marker of additional, positive hygiene practices and other favorable health behaviors in the same individuals.","Wada, Koji; Oka-Ezoe, Kuniko; Smith, Derek R",BMC Public Health,117,30

This article provides a review of the recent literature on anxiety and depressive disorders with a focus on linkages with several important viral diseases. Although the majority of studies have been conducted in developed countries such as the United States and Great Britain, some studies have been carried out in less developed nations where only a small percentage of persons with mental illness receive treatment for their condition. The studies summarized in this review indicate that there are important linkages between anxiety and depression and viral diseases such as influenza A (H1N1) and other influenza viruses, varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and hepatitis C. Additional studies are needed to further clarify the mechanisms for interactions between mental health and communicable diseases, in order to assist patients and further prevention and control efforts.","Coughlin, Steven S.",Public Health Rev,117,30
1658,1658,1658,Characterizing Influenza surveillance systems performance: application of a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to Hong Kong surveillance data,20.29953,0.97797793,2014-08-15,"BACKGROUND: Infectious disease surveillance is a process the product of which reflects both actual disease trends and public awareness of the disease. Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. METHODS: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. RESULTS: Some surveillance systems — especially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreak — are more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.

3046,3046,3046,Crisis Communication in Public Health Emergencies: The Limits of ‘Legal Control’ and the Risks for Harmful Outcomes in a Digital Age,20.277668,0.5003653,2018-02-06,"Communication by public authorities during a crisis situation is an essential and indispensable part of any response to a situation that may threaten both life and property. In the online connected world possibilities for such communication have grown further, in particular with the opportunity that social media presents. As a consequence, communication strategies have become a key plank of responses to crises ranging from epidemics to terrorism to natural disaster. Such strategies involve a range of innovative practices on social media. Whilst being able to bring about positive effects, they can also bring about a range of harmful unintended side effects. This include economic harms produced by incorrect information and a range of social harms that can be fuelled by myths and rumours, worsening negative phenomena such as stigmatisation and discrimination. Given the potential for such harms, one might expect that affected or potentially affected individuals would be able to challenge such measures before courts or administrative tribunals. As this paper demonstrates however this is not the case. More often than not seemingly applicable legal approaches are unlikely to be able to engage such methods. This is often because such measures represent activities that are purely expressive in nature and therefore not capable of imposing any binding legal or corporeal changes on individuals. Whilst some forms of soft law may pose requirements for public officials involved in such activities (e.g. codes of conduct or of professional ethics), they are not likely to offer potentially harmed individuals the chance to to challenge particular communication strategies before courts or legal tribunals. The result is that public authorities largely have a free reign to communicate how they wish and do not have to have to comply with a range of requirements (e.g. relating to form and substantive) content) that would in general apply to most forms of official administrative act.","Quinn, Paul",Life Sci Soc Policy,117,30

Five different methods for estimating ED visits for respiratory illness from Telehealth Ontario calls are compared, including two non-linear modeling methods. Daily visit estimates up to 14 days in advance were made at the health unit level for all 36 Ontario health units. Methods: Telehealth calls from June 1, 2004 to March 14, 2006 were included. Estimates generated by regression, Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), Numerical Methods for Subspace State Space Identification (N4SID), Fast Orthogonal Search (FOS), and Parallel Cascade Identification (PCI) were compared to the actual number of ED visits for respiratory illness identified from the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) database. Model predictor variables included Telehealth Ontario calls and upcoming holidays/weekends. Models were fit using the first 304 days of data and prediction accuracy was measured over the remaining 348 days. Results: Forecast accuracy was significantly better (p<0.0001) for the 12 Ontario health units with a population over 400,000 (75% of the Ontario population) than for smaller health units. Compared to regression, FOS produced better estimates (p=0.03) while there was no significant improvement for PCI-based estimates. FOS, PCI, EWMA and N4SID performed worse than regression over the remaining smaller health units. Conclusion: Telehealth can be used to estimate ED visits for respiratory illness at the health unit level. Non-linear modeling methods produced better estimates than regression in larger health units.","Perry, Alexander G.; Moore, Kieran M.; Levesque, Linda E.; Pickett, C.

Limited exposure to violence is seen as a component of healthy living. However, there is limited understanding of violence from a public health perspective within rural communities. Rural refers to those communities with a population less than 10,000 outside the main commuting zone of a large urban area. Population health approaches, including the social determinants of health, are well supported by public health officials. Generating information about rural youth violence from a Canadian perspective would add to our understanding of these social determinants while providing guidance for policy and program development. Current understandings of youth violence are limited to an urban, and oftentimes, American perspective. An ongoing two-phase Canadian study on rural youth violence included qualitative interviews with 52 youth and the completion of a questionnaire that had been developed from the qualitative responses. The questionnaire has been completed by a larger sample of rural youth. The findings generated from this ongoing study will be useful in linking violence with social factors that impact health and thereby guide population health programs and policies. In this way, the role of public health to develop policies and implement programs will be directly influenced by evidence while addressing an ongoing public health concern.","Kulig, Judith C.; Nahachewsky, Deana; Hall, Barry L.; Kalischuk, Ruth Grant",Can J Public Health,117,30

As a result, sequence similarity of paralogous genes is significantly higher than expected from their evolutionary distance. Gene conversion, a “copy paste” DNA repair mechanism that transfers sequences from one gene to another and homologous recombination are drivers of concerted evolution. Nevertheless, some gene family members escape concerted evolution and acquire sufficient sequence differences that orthologous genes can be assigned in descendant species. Reasons why some gene family members can escape while others are captured by concerted evolution are poorly understood. By analyzing the entire CEA gene family in cattle (Bos taurus) we identified a member (CEACAM32) that was created by gene duplication and cooption of a unique transmembrane domain exon in the most recent ancestor of ruminants. CEACAM32 shows a unique, testis-specific expression pattern. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CEACAM32 is not involved in concerted evolution of CEACAM1 paralogs in ruminants. However, analysis of gene conversion events revealed that CEACAM32 is subject to gene conversion but remarkably, these events are found in the leader exon and intron sequences but not in exons coding for the Ig-like domains. These findings suggest that natural selection hinders gene conversion affecting protein sequences of the mature protein and thereby support escape of CEACAM32 from concerted evolution.","Hänske, Jana; Hammacher, Tim; Grenkowitz, Franziska; Mansfeld, Martin; Dau, Tung Huy; Maksimov, Pavlo; Friedrich, Christin; Zimmermann, Wolfgang; Kammerer, Robert",Sci Rep,117,30

However, the benefits of Antonovsky’s theory for population health promotion practices and health care restructuring are unrealized. This analysis uses the definition of health derived from complexity science as a lifelong, multidimensional adaptive process comprised of intersecting biological, psychological, social, environmental, and spiritual systems as a starting point for a salutogenic analysis of formal healthcare. Following Antonovsky’s criticism of contemporary healthcare as resting upon a pathogenic paradigm, I outline four general shortcomings associated with the pathogenic approach to healthcare. The basic elements of a healthcare system designed according to principles derived from Antonovsky’s salutogenic model of health are then presented. It is argued that Antonovsky’s theory offers a productive basis for conceptualizing health and healthcare systems in that it allows us to grasp that debates between population health promotion and providing medical care, are, at their root, unproductive debates predicated on a false dichotomy. A salutogenic healthcare system is one which pays credence to the nested complexity of human health and strives to strike an adaptive balance between health production and the provision of medical care.","Fries, Christopher J.",Soc Theory Health,117,30

Vascular leakage of plasma results from inflammatory mediator-induced separation of endothelial cells in postcapillary venules belonging to the tracheobronchial circulation. Whereas proposed mediators of asthma induce reversible leakage, several antiasthma drugs exhibit antileakage effects in animals and humans. Potential consequences of plasma exudation are many. Mucosal/submucosal edema might contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness. Plasma exudate in the airway lumen in asthma may contribute to sloughing of epithelium, impairment of mucociliary transport, narrowing of small airways, and mucus plug formation. Exuded plasma may cause airway inflammation and constriction because of its content of powerful mediators, and chemoattractant factors and plasma proteins may condition the inflammatory cells abundant in asthmatic airways to release mediators in response to stimuli that otherwise would be innocuous to the cells. It is concluded that inflammatory stimulus-induced increase in macromolecular permeability of the tracheobronchial microvasculature and mucosa may be a significant pathogenetic mechanism in asthma and that the postcapillary venular endothelium and airway epithelium that regulate leakage of plasma are important effector cells in this disease.","Persson, Carl G.

In this study, the potential RNA pseudoknots just downstream from the known and suspected retroviral frameshift sites were predicted in the Rous sarcoma virus, primate immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV), equine infectious anemia virus, visna virus, bovine leukemia virus, human T-cell leukemia virus (types I and II), mouse mammary tumor virus, Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, and simian SRV-1 type-D retrovirus. Also, the putative RNA pseudoknots were detected in the gag-pol overlaps of two retrotransposons of Drosophila, 17.6 and gypsy, and the mouse intracisternal A particle. For each sequence, the thermodynamic stability and statistical significance of the secondary structure involved in the predicted tertiary structure were assessed and compared. Our results show that the stem-loop structures in the pseudoknots are both thermodynamically highly stable and statistically significant relative to other such configurations that potentially occur in the gag-pool or gag-pro and pro-pol junction domains of these viruses (300 nucleotides upstream and downstream from the possible frameshift sites are included). Moreover, the structural features of the predicted pseudoknots following the frameshift site of propol overlaps of the HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 retroviruses are structurally well conserved. The occurence of eight compensatory base changes in the tertiary interaction of the two related sequences allow the conservation of their tertiary structures in spite of the sequence divergence. The results support the possible control mechanism for frameshifting proposed by Brierley et al. [1] and Jacks et al. [2, 3].","Shu-Yun Le; Shapiro, Bruce A.; Chen, Jih-H.; Nussinov, Ruth; Maizel, Jacob V.",Genet Anal Tech Appl,117,30

Transfection and transgenic studies have identified the open reading frame (ORF) present in the 3′ long terminal repeat (LTR) as encoding superantigen function. In this study, we have used an in vitro translation system in an attempt to characterize the molecular nature of the protein encoded by the 3′ ORF of Mtv‐8. Using various constructs encoding full‐length and truncated versions of the ORF product, we report that the hydrophobic region close to the amino terminus of the 36‐kDa protein can function as a transmembrane domain. Protease digestion experiments also demonstrate that the protein has a type‐II transmembrane conformation with an extra‐cytoplasmic carboxy terminus. Since this hydrophobic region is conserved between all known MMTV, we speculate that LTR ORF, including those proposed to encode the minor lymphocyte stimulatory antigens, are also capable of encoding type‐II transmembrane glycoproteins. The polymorphism between MMTV LTR ORF products, which correlates with deletion phenotypes, is predominantly in the carboxy‐terminal extracellular region, consistent with a major role in interaction with the T cell receptor.","Knight, Andrew M.; Harrison, Georgina B.; Pease, Richard J.; Robinson, Peter J.; Julian Dyson, P.",Eur J Immunol,117,30

These values were then related to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of a number of equine pathogenic bacteria to determine the duration of therapeutic serum concentrations of the aminoglycosides in the horse. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the data using neomycin as the example revealed a mean (± sd) peak serum concentration of 23.2 ± 10.2 μg/ml present at 30 mins, and at 8 h the serum concentration was 2.8 ± 0.8 μg/ml. From the pharmacological analysis of concentration‐time data it was shown that neomycin was very rapidly absorbed from the im injection site, with an absorption half‐time of 0.16 ± 0.05 and was well absorbed (systemic availability was 73.7 ± 26.9 per cent). A peak tissue level, which represented 40 per cent of the amount of drug in the body, was obtained at 32 mins after injection of the drug. At 8 h, the fractions of the dose in the central and peripheral compartments of the model were 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively, and 96 per cent was the cumulative amount eliminated up to that time. Based on the MIC values of the majority of isolates of Corynebacterium equi, and only a few isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus equi, one would expect a serum concentration of more than 2 μg neomycin/ml up to 8 h following im dosage (10 mg/kg) to be therapeutically effective.","BAGGOT, J.

The aim of this study was to investigate the immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of the 2009 A/H1N1 MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine, administered sequentially or simultaneously with the seasonal 2009–10 virosomal-adjuvanted influenza vaccine, to paediatric kidney transplant recipients. Methods. Thirty-two children and adolescents with transplanted kidneys and 32 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were randomized 1:1 to receive the pandemic vaccine upon enrolment and the seasonal vaccine 1 month later (16 transplant recipients and 16 healthy controls), or to receive the two vaccines simultaneously upon enrolment (16 transplant recipients and 16 healthy controls). Results. When the pandemic vaccine was administered sequentially to the seasonal vaccine, it was significantly less immunogenic in the patients than in the controls (P < 0.05); when it was administered together with the seasonal vaccine, the immune response of both patients (P < 0.05) and controls (P < 0.05) was significantly greater than when it was administered sequentially. Seroconversion rates and the geometric mean titres of all of the seasonal antigens were significantly lower in the patients, regardless of the type of vaccine administration (P < 0.05). Simultaneous administration was associated with a better immune response against A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 antigens in both patients and controls, and did not increase the mild local and systemic reactions. No impact on renal function was observed. Conclusions. Paediatric kidney transplant recipients have a lower immune response to the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 MF59-adjuvanted and seasonal virosomal-adjuvanted influenza vaccines than healthy controls. The simultaneous administration of the two vaccines seems to increase immune response to both pandemic and seasonal A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 antigens, and has the same safety profile as that of the pandemic vaccine administered sequentially to the seasonal vaccine.","Esposito, Susanna; Meregalli, Elisa; Daleno, Cristina; Ghio, Luciana; Tagliabue, Claudia; Valzano, Antonia; Serra, Domenico; Galeone, Carlotta; Edefonti, Alberto; Principi, Nicola",Nephrol Dial Transplant,117,30

OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between parental and adolescent prescription opioid medical use and misuse. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, nationally representative study included 15 200 parent-adolescent dyads from the annual 2015-2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Data were collected from January 6, 2015, to December 20, 2017, and analyzed from October 4, 2019, to October 15, 2020. EXPOSURES: Parental past 12-month exclusive medical prescription opioid use and any misuse (ie, using without a prescription or in any way not directed by a physician). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adolescent past 12-month medical prescription opioid use or misuse. Multivariable regressions estimated associations between parental and offspring medical prescription opioid use or misuse, controlling for sociodemographic and psychosocial variables. RESULTS: Respondents included 9400 mother-child and 5800 father-child dyads in the same household; children were aged 12 to 17 years (52.8% male; mean [SD] age, 14.5 [1.7] years). Controlling for other factors, parental medical prescription opioid use was associated with adolescent prescription opioid medical use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.06-1.53) and misuse (aOR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.07-2.25), whereas parental misuse was not. Parental medical prescription stimulant use was associated with adolescent medical prescription opioid use (aOR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02-1.91). Parental marijuana use (aOR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.13-2.99), parent-adolescent conflict (aOR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.52), and adolescent depression (aOR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.26-2.44) were associated with adolescent prescription opioid misuse. Adolescent delinquency (aOR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.38-1.74) and perceived schoolmates’ drug use (aOR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.95-4.23) were also associated with adolescent misuse and more weakly with medical use (aORs, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.05-1.22] and 1.61 [95% CI, 1.32-1.96], respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Youth use of prescription opioids is in part a structural/environmental issue. The findings of this study suggest that parental medical prescription opioid use is associated with offspring prescription opioid use, whereas parental misuse is not. Restricting physicians’ opioid prescribing to parents is a crucial public health goal. In addition, parents could be educated on the risks of their prescription opioid use for offspring and on practices to mitigate risk, including safe medication storage and disposal. Screening for parental prescription opioid use could be part of pediatric practice. Addressing adolescent mental health could also reduce adolescent prescription opioid misuse.","Griesler, Pamela C.; Hu, Mei-Chen; Wall, Melanie M.; Kandel, Denise B.",JAMA Netw Open,117,30

In addition to this well-known function in infection, inflammation, and immunity, emerging evidence suggests that the STING1-dependent signaling network is implicated in health and disease by regulating autophagic degradation or various cell death modalities (e.g., apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, mitotic cell death, and immunogenic cell death [ICD]). Here, we outline the latest advances in our understanding of the regulating mechanisms and signaling pathways of STING1 in autophagy and cell death, which may shed light on new targets for therapeutic interventions.","Zhang, Ruoxi; Kang, Rui; Tang, Daolin",Signal Transduct Target Ther,117,30

The appropriate ventilatory strategy remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the impact of ultra-low tidal volume ventilation with tidal volume of 3 ml/kg predicted body weight (PBW) in patients with CPE and veno–arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V–A ECMO) on lung inflammation compared to conventional ventilation. METHODS: A single-centre randomized crossover trial was performed in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at a tertiary university hospital. Seventeen adults requiring V–A ECMO and mechanical ventilation due to cardiogenic shock were included from February 2017 to December 2018. Patients were ventilated for two consecutive periods of 24 h with tidal volumes of 6 and 3 ml/kg of PBW, respectively, applied in random order. Primary outcome was the change in proinflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) between both ventilatory strategies. RESULTS: Ventilation with 3 ml/kg PBW yielded lower driving pressures and end-expiratory lung volumes. Overall, there were no differences in BALF cytokines. Post hoc analyses revealed that patients with high baseline levels of IL-6 showed statistically significant lower levels of IL-6 and IL-8 during ultra-low tidal volume ventilation. This reduction was significantly proportional to the decrease in driving pressure. In contrast, those with lower IL-6 baseline levels showed a significant increase in these biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Ultra-low tidal volume ventilation in patients with CPE and V–A ECMO may attenuate inflammation in selected cases. VALI may be driven by an interaction between the individual proinflammatory profile and the mechanical load overimposed by the ventilator.

We characterized the crude enzyme from bacterial culture fluid, recombinant enzyme rChit62J4, and its catalytic domain rChit62J4cat. This major chitinase, securing nutrition of the bacterium in the human intestinal tract when supplied with chitin, has a pH optimum of 5.5 and processes pNGG with K(m) = 0.24 mM and k(cat) = 30.0 s(−1). Sequence comparison of the amino acid sequence of Chit62J4, determined during bacterial genome sequencing, characterizes the enzyme as a family 18 glycosyl hydrolase with a four-domain structure. The catalytic domain has the typical TIM barrel structure and the accessory domains—2x Fn3/Big3 and a carbohydrate binding module—that likely supports enzyme activity on chitin fibers. The catalytic domain is highly homologous to a single-domain chitinase of Bacillus cereus NCTU2. However, the catalytic profiles significantly differ between the two enzymes despite almost identical catalytic sites. The shift of pI and pH optimum of the commensal enzyme toward acidic values compared to the soil bacterium is the likely environmental adaptation that provides C. paraputrificum J4 a competitive advantage over other commensal bacteria.","Dohnálek, Jan; Dušková, Jarmila; Tishchenko, Galina; Kolenko, Petr; Skálová, Tereza; Novák, Petr; Fejfarová, Karla; Šimůnek, Jiří",Molecules,117,30

Eleven children(9 days to 5 yrs) with meningitis due to H. influenzae (7 cases), S. pneumoniae(2) , group B streptococcus (1) , and Salmonella sp.(1), were treated with 40 mg/kg of IV cefotaxime q6hrs. Cefotaxime levels were determined by HPLC. The mean cefotaxime plasma level 3 hrs after a dose early in the treatment was 14.1 mg/L(range 5.1-42.2 mg/L), and the mean CSF level was 3.9 mg/L(0.7-16.6 mg/L). The mean CSF diffusion rate was 26.4%.

Cefotaxime MBC for the infecting organisms ranged between 0.015 mg/L and 0.25 mg/L. CSF was bactericidal to the infecting organisms at dilutions between 8 and 256. The CSF diffusion correlated positively with the cefotaxime plasma level (r=0.86), CSF protein (r=0.63), CSF leukocyte count (r=0.61) and negatively with CSF sugar (r=-0.37).All patients responded well to treatment with no apparent sequelae.

Since athletes are expected to return to training as soon as possible, the knowledge of these diseases, their clinical presentation, possible complications, transmission mechanisms, and prevention should be among the main concerns of sports medicine. Infectious diseases can be prolonged or aggravated by continuing physical activity and athletes also risk having other acute or chronic organ manifestations such as bronchitis or pneumonia, myocarditis, pericarditis, and other secondary complications, for this reason exercise should not be allowed during convalescence and recovery. In the case of elite athletes, the return-to-play decision is particularly important and consensus between scientific evidence and clinical experience is necessary. Although infectious diseases are highly prevalent in athletes, there is a scarcity of literature focused on evidence and guidelines for sports physicians regarding RTP decision.

A novel human coronavirus, named SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), derived from SARS patients was reported as the etiologic agent of SARS. Studying the signaling pathways of SARS-infected cells is key to understanding the molecular mechanism of SARS viral infection. Cell death is observed in cultured Vero E6 cells after SARS-CoV infection. From SARS-CoV infection to cell death, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a key participant in the determination of cell death and survival. Two signaling pathways comprising signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) are downstream of p38 MAPK. AKT and JNK (Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase) signaling pathways are important to establish persistent infection of SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells. Expression studies of SARS-CoV proteins indicate that the viral proteins are able to activate signaling pathways of host cells. The study of signaling pathways in SARS-CoV patients is difficult to perform compared with in vitro studies due to the effects of the human immune system. This review highlights recent progress in characterizing signal transduction pathways in SARS-CoV-infected cells in vitro and in vivo.","Mizutani, Tetsuya",Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus,117,5

Although this channel is expressed in many tissues, its impaired function in airway epithelial cells leads to hyperviscous mucous secretions impeding effective mucociliary clearance. Impaired clearance of inhaled microorganisms results in the establishment of chronic infection, triggering an overexaggerated inflammatory response. The resulting release of inflammatory cytokines and enzymes causes pulmonary damage in the form of bronchiectasis, further impairing mucociliary action, forming a vicious cycle. Subsequent respiratory failure remains the leading cause of death in individuals with CF.","Waters, Valerie J.; LiPuma, John J.",Cystic Fibrosis,117,30

Thus, the concepts of open‐plan office design have been defined as providing at least a basic solution to many of these notable and current challenges in current working systems and organizations. In fact, open workspaces are often suggested since they offer more flexibility for dynamic organizational changes and fast technological growth in the modern working style. Today because of the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) there is a need to focus even on new open‐plan office designs to prevent and minimize health risks. The fact is the world needs to be ready for new viruses and or perhaps to unknown diseases in the future.

Secondary objectives • To assess overall survival, and the overall survival rate at 28 56 and 84 days. • To assess SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance and load as well as antibody titres. • To assess the percentage of patients that required mechanical ventilation. • To assess time from randomisation until discharge. TRIAL DESIGN: Randomised, open-label, multicenter phase II trial, designed to assess the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 disease in high-risk patients (group 1 to group 4) following treatment with anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma or standard of care. PARTICIPANTS: High-risk patients >18 years of age hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection in 10-15 university medical centres will be included. High-risk is defined as SARS-CoV-2 positive infection with Oxygen saturation at ≤ 94% at ambient air with additional risk features as categorised in 4 groups: • Group 1, pre-existing or concurrent hematological malignancy and/or active cancer therapy (incl. chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery) within the last 24 months or less. • Group 2, chronic immunosuppression not meeting the criteria of group 1. • Group 3, age ≥ 50 - 75 years meeting neither the criteria of group 1 nor group 2 and at least one of these criteria: Lymphopenia < 0.8 x G/l and/or D-dimer > 1μg/mL. • Group 4, age ≥ 75 years meeting neither the criteria of group 1 nor group 2. Observation time for all patients is expected to be at least 3 months after entry into the study. Patients receive convalescent plasma for two days (day 1 and day 2) or standard of care. For patients in the standard arm, cross over is allowed from day 10 in case of not improving or worsening clinical condition. Nose/throat swabs for determination of viral load are collected at day 0 and day 1 (before first CP administration) and subsequently at day 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 28 or until discharge. Serum for SARS-Cov-2 diagnostic is collected at baseline and subsequently at day 3, 7, 14 and once during the follow-up period (between day 35 and day 84). There is a regular follow-up of 3 months. All discharged patients are followed by regular phone calls. All visits, time points and study assessments are summarized in the Trial Schedule (see full protocol Table 1). All participating trial sites will be supplied with study specific visit worksheets that list all assessments and procedures to be completed at each visit. All findings including clinical and laboratory data are documented by the investigator or an authorized member of the study team in the patient's medical record and in the electronic case report forms (eCRFs). INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: This trial will analyze the effects of convalescent plasma from recovered subjects with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in high-risk patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients at high risk for a poor outcome due to underlying disease, age or condition as listed above are eligible for enrollment. In addition, eligible patients have a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and O(2) saturation ≤ 94% while breathing ambient air. Patients are randomised to receive (experimental arm) or not receive (standard arm) convalescent plasma in two bags (238 - 337 ml plasma each) from different donors (day 1, day 2). A cross over from the standard arm into the experimental arm is possible after day 10 in case of not improving or worsening clinical condition. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary endpoints: The main purpose of the study is to assess the time from randomisation until an improvement within 84 days defined as two points on a seven-point ordinal scale or live discharge from the hospital in high-risk patients (group 1 to group 4) with SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospital admission by infusion of plasma from subjects after convalescence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection or standard of care. Secondary endpoints: • Overall survival, defined as the time from randomisation until death from any cause 28-day, 56-day and 84-day overall survival rates. • SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance and load as well as antibody titres. • Requirement mechanical ventilation at any time during hospital stay (yes/no). • Time until discharge from randomisation. • Viral load, changes in antibody titers and cytokine profiles are analysed in an exploratory manner using paired non-parametric tests (before – after treatment). RANDOMISATION: Upon confirmation of eligibility (patients must meet all inclusion criteria and must not meet exclusion criteria described in section 5.3 and 5.4 of the full protocol), the clinical site must contact a centralized internet randomization system (https://randomizer.at/). Patients are randomized using block randomisation to one of the two arms, experimental arm or standard arm, in a 1:1 ratio considering a stratification according to the 4 risk groups (see Participants). BLINDING (MASKING): The study is open-label, no blinding will be performed. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total number of 174 patients is required for the entire trial, n=87 per group.

RESULTS: Retrospective comparative study included 142 confirmed COVID-19 patients by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, with different degrees of disease (mild to severe), the data of patients collected from medical records, and patients with their first CT chest read for calculating CO-RADS and severity scoring system (CT-SS) score. The patients with severe COVID-19 disease were significantly older and had different comorbidities. The level of C-reactive protein, ESR, ferritin, and LDH were significantly higher in severe disease, P < 0.001. The ability of CT chest and its score bases (CT-SS and CO-RADS) were accurate in differentiation between mild/moderate and severe disease; AUC were 89% and 97%, respectively. The cutoff value of less than 7.5 and 4.5 for CT-SS and CO-RADS, respectively, can rule out severe COVID-19 by 90% and 97%, respectively.

The USDA granted multiple waivers to allow flexibility in WIC operations during the pandemic. The objective of this study was to hear from WIC participants about the impact of changes due to COVID-19. METHODS: In the summer of 2020, 60 semi-structured interviews were completed, half with English-speaking and half with Spanish-speaking WIC participants in the Los Angeles area. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a deductive content analysis approach to describe responses and identify themes. RESULTS: Four themes emerged: 1) The pandemic has exacerbated the ckhallenges facing low-income families; 2) WIC continues to be a valued resource especially under the challenging circumstances; 3) WIC's transition to remote service delivery has ensured that families continue to receive not only critical WIC food benefits, but also nutrition education and support; 4) Lessons learned during COVID-19 can inform needed WIC modernizations to maximize WIC's proven benefits post-pandemic. Nearly 75% of WIC participants faced reductions in income due to job loss or reduced work hours. Nearly 60% of households reported experiencing food insecurity. Early in the pandemic, many reported challenges accessing WIC-eligible foods, resulting in lost food benefits. Approximately 43% reported getting food from a food pantry or church, with most (77%) reporting first time usage. Participants shared that even with the change to only remote education, they valued the information and were very satisfied with WIC services. The majority (83%) found the California WIC App helpful in informing what WIC foods they could purchase. Participants also reported that enrolling in WIC remotely was easier than coming in-person and they were comfortable providing documents related to income and eligibility determination remotely. CONCLUSIONS: WIC has been essential in helping families cope with COVID. WIC's transition to remote service delivery has ensured seamless and safe delivery of services, helping families with young children during an unprecedented time of need.

In humans, breast cancer shows diverse characteristics, including HER2-driven subtypes and viral-driven subtypes. HER2 can be targeted; however, escape of the cancer from targeted therapies remains a problem. In this work we evaluated the capacity of Rlip knockout to prevent breast cancer in genetically engineered mouse models of HER2-driven breast cancer (Erbb2 model) and polyomavirus-driven breast cancer (PyVT model). We found that in Erbb2 mice, Rlip knockout significantly delayed oncogenesis and reduced the expression of genes associated with poor prognosis in patients. In PyVT mice, Rlip knockout did not delay oncogenesis or tumor growth, but Rlip knockdown reduced tumor metastasis to the lung. We conclude that Rlip inhibitors may significantly improve survival in HER2-positive patients, but are unlikely to offer benefits to patients with polyomavirus-associated tumors. ABSTRACT: We recently reported that loss of one or both alleles of Ralbp1, which encodes the stress-protective protein RLIP76 (Rlip), exerts a strong dominant negative effect on both the inherent cancer susceptibility and the chemically inducible cancer susceptibility of mice lacking one or both alleles of the tumor suppressor p53. In this paper, we examined whether congenital Rlip deficiency could prevent genetically-driven breast cancer in two transgenic mouse models: the MMTV-PyVT model, which expresses the polyomavirus middle T antigen (PyVT) under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (MMTV) and the MMTV-Erbb2 model which expresses MMTV-driven erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (Erbb2, HER2/Neu) and frequently acquires p53 mutations. We found that loss of either one or two Rlip alleles had a suppressive effect on carcinogenesis in Erbb2 over-expressing mice. Interestingly, Rlip deficiency did not affect tumor growth but significantly reduced the lung metastatic burden of breast cancer in the viral PyVT model, which does not depend on either Ras or loss of p53. Furthermore, spontaneous tumors of MMTV-PyVT/Rlip+/+ mice showed no regression following Rlip knockdown. Finally, mice lacking one or both Rlip alleles differentially expressed markers for apoptotic signaling, proliferation, angiogenesis, and cell cycling in PyVT and Erbb2 breast tumors. Our results support the efficacy of Rlip depletion in suppressing p53 inactivated cancers, and our findings may yield novel methods for prevention or treatment of cancer in patients with HER2 mutations or tumor HER2 expression.","Singh, Sharda P.; Lee, Jihyun; Bose, Chhanda; Li, Hongzhi; Yuan, Yate-Ching; Hindle, Ashly; Singhal, Sharad S.; Kopel, Jonathan; Palade, Philip T.; Jones, Catherine; Rahman, Rakhshanda L.; Awasthi, Sanjay",Cancers (Basel),117,16

All patients had bedside ultrasound technology scanning. Furthermore, the indexes were calculated for inferior vena cava (IVC), peripheral arteries, and heart. The prognostic deaths were recorded. It was found that, in the MBT group, the mortality was lower (7.55% vs. 24.23%) (P < 0.05), and these indexes were higher for the IVC expansion (IVCE), the respiration variation index (RVI) of IVC (ΔIVC(2)), the peak flow velocity RVI of brachial artery (ΔVpeak(BA)), femoral artery (ΔVpeak(FA)), left ventricular outflow tract (ΔVpeak(L)), and aorta (ΔVpeak(AO)), as well as peak flow velocity time integral RVI of aorta (ΔVTI(AO)) (P < 0.05). In conclusion, early MBTs can elevate survival rate and prognostic living quality and alleviate the atrophy degree of IVC, peripheral artery, and blood vessel of patients with severely injured trauma. Furthermore, bedside ultrasound scanning demonstrated superb capabilities in quantitatively displaying hemodynamics and outcomes of MBTs of patients with severely injured trauma.","Song, Lei; Zhang, Jianguo; Liu, Junliang",J Healthc Eng,117,1

It must be assumed that the abrupt switch from traditional psychotherapy to the video setting (VS) has an impact on the therapeutic relationship and thus on the therapeutic process. This study examined how the switch from traditional treatment to VBT (and back again) during the COVID-19 pandemic was experienced by patients and therapists with respect to the therapeutic relationship and the therapeutic process. METHODS: Group-specific, semi-structured interviews with therapists (n = 8), therapists in training (n = 6), and patients (n = 9). RESULTS: The results show that the majority of participants, both therapists as well as patients, experienced the therapeutic situation in VS as more permeable and less predictable. Although the VS contributes to maintenance of the therapeutic situation, the interaction was described as shallow and less oriented. Furthermore, every setting change was associated with a process of habituation. Therefore, the therapeutic work can only be carried out with the highest possible intensity after several sessions within each setting. CONCLUSION: The possibility of maintaining the therapeutic relationship using VBT can lead to a strengthening of the therapeutic alliance. Although the VS is associated with uncertainties, shame-ridden topics can be addressed more freely. Anxiety patients, in particular, could engage in a more intense therapeutic process after a universally observed phase of habituation.","Leukhardt, Alena; Heider, Maximilian; Reboly, Katharina; Franzen, Georg; Eichenberg, Christiane",Psychotherapeut (Berl),117,30

SUMMARY ANSWER: Treatment-related procedures keep changing directions, exposing the women to high level of uncertainty. Changes in treatments may be perceived as threats to achieving parenting goals. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Both infertility and the treatment process constitute a stressful experience. Literature reports that couples describe infertility as the most difficult challenge to overcome in their lives. In addition, it has been reported that women experience more anxiety, stress, and depression than men during this period. Societies and individuals affected by large-scale disasters, such as global pandemics, can develop stress-related disorders. Current data indicate that closure of fertility clinic during the COVID–19 pandemic was associated with a sharp increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression among patients undergoing fertility treatments and was perceived as an uncontrollable and stressful event. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The research was designed as a qualitative study. The data were collected from two Internet forums between October - December 2020. Blogs most frequently used by women with infertility in Turkey were simultaneously selected. The comments of 30 women were included. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Data were screened by using the directed qualitative content analysis. After selecting the blog, emotions, thoughts, and coping strategies expressed by 30 women whose treatment was canceled due to the Covid–19 pandemic or who continued treatment during this period were included in the analysis. The themes created were adapted to Lazarus and Folkman’s Transactional Model of Stress and Coping. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The thematic analysis of the expression of women with infertility problems in accordance with the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping stages of Lazarus and Folkman resulted in 4 themes: psychological changes, cognitive changes, changes in social life, and coping strategies. Some women perceived changes in treatments positively, and stopping the treatments due to the uncertainty of the pandemic and its effect on pregnancy and the baby made them feel safe. The majority of women appraised the closure of fertility clinics negatively impacted their lives. They experienced despair, uncertainty, disappointment, anxiety, anger, sadness, and exhaustion from waiting. Also, some participants did not find it right to delay the treatments and felt that the healthcare personnel postponed the treatments to avoid infection. Women experienced feelings of anger, distrust, and threats toward the health authorities. Moreover, the women in our study stated that they were always at home due to the pandemic, far from friends and family, and therefore did did not feel need for self-care and considered themselves ugly. The expressions of women mostly include emotion-based coping strategies. They used activities such as praying, exercising, distracting, noticing the positive side of postponing, and stopping treatments during the pandemic, accepting, and meditating. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Clinics closed due to the pandemic or limited procedures caused fewer women to come to the clinics. At the same time, it is not accepted for anyone other than working in the clinic to come to the clinics for scientific studies. Therefore, comments of women have been reached through blogs. Wider implications of the findings: It is believed that approaches based on Lazarus and Folkman’s model helped the health professionals to determine potential stressors for women with infertility during the pandemic, and identified areas that required strengthening and improved personal coping strategies.

Critical illness is characterized by great variability in EE, which is influenced by the disease itself and the effects of treatment. Indirect calorimetry (IC) is currently the gold standard to measure EE in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. However, calorimeters are not widely available, and predictive formulas (PF) are still commonly used, leading to under or overfeeding and deleterious consequences.Important metabolic changes occur and catabolism becomes prominent in critically ill patients.Both hyper and hypometabolism can be observed, but hypermetabolic patients appear to have higher mortality rates compared to metabolically normal patients. This study aimed to assess hypermetabolism incidence and compare clinical outcomes between hypermetabolic and normometabolic patients in ICU. Methods: A single-center, retrospective, and observational study was conducted in the ICU of the Hospital do Divino Espírito Santo in Ponta Delgada, between August 2018 and February 2021. Only invasively mechanically ventilated patients were included. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was predicted by 25 kcal/kg/day formula to obtain predicted resting energy expenditure (PREE), and REE was measured by IC to obtain measured resting energy expenditure (MREE). According to their metabolic state (PREE/MREE), patients were divided into hypermetabolic (≥1.3) and normometabolic (<1.3). To determine the limits of agreement between PREE and MREE, we performed a Bland-Altman (BA) analysis. Baseline characteristics, severity criteria, nutritional status, and main diagnosis on admission were compared. The primary outcome considered was 30-day mortality. Other outcomes such as the ICU length of stay (LOS), in-hospital LOS, and length of invasive ventilation were also evaluated. Results: Among the 80 ICU patients included in the final analysis, 67 patients were normometabolic (83.4%). Patients admitted due to pneumonia were more hypermetabolic, 8 (61.5%) vs. 10 (14.9%); p<0.001. Hypermetabolism was found also in patients admitted due to sepsis/septic shock, 7 (53.8%) vs. 16 (23.9%); p=0.029. Hypermetabolic patients had lower body mass index (22.5 [interquartile range (IQR): 21.5-24.9] vs. 27.7 [IQR: 25.0-32.4] kg/m(2); p=0.001) and higher MREE (2715.0 [2399.0-3090.0] vs. 1690.0 [1410.0-2190.0] kcal/day; p<0.001). Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean difference of -5.6 ± 744.7 Kcal/day between the PREE and MREE by IC. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups, neither in 30-day mortality nor in the other outcomes considered. Conclusions: Hypermetabolism was not seen to present a greater risk of death in mechanically ventilated patients in ICU. Lower BMI, sepsis/septic shock, and pneumonia appear to be associated with a hypermetabolic state.","Sousa, Grimanesa; Mendes, Inês; Tavares, Luís; Brotas Carvalho, Rita; Henriques, Manuela; Costa, Humberto",,117,1

The student-led Cambridge University Wilderness Medicine Society devised a low-cost wilderness medicine teaching weekend that can be replicated at other institutions. METHODS The weekend course consisted of small-group lessons introducing the roles of the expedition doctor and expedition leader and the assessment and management of acute conditions in remote environments. This was followed by a 3-station circuit to teach the principles of casualty triage, splinting, and construction of rope stretchers. These skills were then practiced in simulations in which participants rotated roles as care providers and patients. Participant confidence was compared before the course and immediately on course completion using the related-samples Wilcoxon signed-ranks test with significance accepted at P<0.05. Usefulness of course content and perceptions of learning were also assessed. RESULTS Sixty-one medical students attended the wilderness teaching weekend and completed the structured feedback questionnaires. Participants rated the course highly in terms of usefulness of course content (mean±SD=18.3±1.9, range=12-20) and perceptions of learning (mean±SD=37.6±2.6, range=31-40), with 92% of participants ""strongly agreeing"" that the course was of high quality. There was an improvement in perceived confidence after course completion (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS We have demonstrated that a teaching program consisting of structured, low-cost ""teaching weekends"" is a potential solution to the lack of centralized national wilderness medicine teaching and can be integrated, with minimal disruption, into the undergraduate curriculum.","To, Benjaman; Tailor, Bhavesh V; Beverley, Jodie; Moore, George; Peng, Yuhan",Wilderness & environmental medicine,117,1

The sustainability of systems for producing food and other products is sometimes assessed using too narrow a range of component factors. A production system might be unsustainable because of adverse effects on a wide range of aspects of human welfare, animal welfare, or the environment. All factors should be included in sustainability evaluation, otherwise products or actions might be avoided without adequate consideration of key factors or of the diversity of production systems. A scoring method that is based on scientific information and potentially of general relevance is presented here, using beef production as a example with a review of each of its sustainability components. This includes an overall combined score and specific factors that make the system unacceptable for some consumers. The results show that, in this example, the sustainability of the best systems is very much better than that of the worst systems. By taking account of scores for a wide range of components of sustainability in comparing beef-production systems, better quality policies about beef use can be formulated than when statements referring only to one system are considered. The least sustainable beef-production systems are extensive grazing that causes land degradation and the use of feedlots or indoor housing with grain feeding. Semi-intensive silvopastoral systems are the most sustainable beef-production systems, and well-managed pasture-fed beef from areas where crop production is uneconomic is also sustainable. This simple, scientifically based scoring system could be modified to use positive as well as negative scores and is of value for policy makers, researchers, producers, organisations aiming to improve sustainability, and the general public.","Broom, Donald M",Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,117,1

In this study, we evaluated risk factors for hospitalization with LRTI in a region in southwest Alaska. METHODS The study was conducted from October 1, 2006, to September 30, 2007, in the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta region of Alaska. Cases were recruited from children <3 years of age hospitalized with LRTI. Controls were recruited during visits to the surrounding communities in the region and matched posthoc to cases on the basis of subregion, season, and age. Parents were interviewed for potential risk factors, and medical records were reviewed. Participants had a nasopharyngeal swab sample taken for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for a panel of respiratory viruses. Samples positive for respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, or parainfluenza type 3 were quantitated by reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS One hundred twenty-eight cases were matched to 186 controls. In a multivariable conditional logistic regression model, significantly (P < .05) increased risk of hospitalization was associated with medically high-risk status, having a woodstove in the house, being bottle fed, and vomiting after feeding; living in a house that had 2 or more rooms with sinks was a protective factor. Viral loads in hospitalized cases were significantly higher than those in controls, but a strict cutoff level was not observed. CONCLUSIONS Several risk factors for LRTI hospitalization were identified in this high risk population. Some factors are amenable to environmental and behavioral interventions.","Bulkow, Lisa R; Singleton, Rosalyn J; DeByle, Carolynn; Miernyk, Karen; Redding, Gregory; Hummel, Kimberlee Boyd; Chikoyak, Lori; Hennessy, Thomas W",Pediatrics,117,19

Using quantitative phosphoproteomics, however, we discovered that Gcn2 targets auxiliary effectors to modulate translation. Accordingly, Gcn2 also phosphorylates the β-subunit of the trimeric eIF2 G protein complex to promote its association with eIF5, which prevents spontaneous nucleotide exchange on eIF2 and thereby restricts the recycling of the initiator methionyl-tRNA-bound eIF2-GDP ternary complex in amino-acid-starved cells. This mechanism contributes to the inhibition of translation initiation in parallel to the sequestration of the nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B by phosphorylated eIF2α. Gcn2 further phosphorylates Gcn20 to antagonize, in an inhibitory feedback loop, the formation of the Gcn2-stimulatory Gcn1-Gcn20 complex. Thus, Gcn2 plays a substantially more intricate role in controlling translation initiation than hitherto appreciated.","Dokládal, Ladislav; Stumpe, Michael; Pillet, Benjamin; Hu, Zehan; Garcia Osuna, Guillermo Miguel; Kressler, Dieter; Dengjel, Jörn; De Virgilio, Claudio",Molecular cell,117,1

ESKAPE bacteria which includes Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae are considered the most important, because of their close relationship with the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The aim of this work was to identify and characterize ESKAPE bacteria and to detect their possible clonal spread in medical devices, patients, and medical personnel of the ICU for COVID-19 patients of the Hospital Juarez de Mexico. METHODOLOGY Genetic identification of ESKAPE bacteria was performed by analyzing the 16S rRNA gene. Resistance assays were performed according to the CLSI guidelines. Assembly of AdeABCRS operon and inhibition assays of pumps efflux in Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were performed. Associated gene involved in biofilm formation (icaA) was performed in isolates belonging to the Staphylococcus genus. Finally, typing by ERIC-PCR and characterization of mobile genetic element SCCmec were done. RESULTS Heterogeneous distribution of ESKAPE and non-ESKAPE bacteria was detected in various medical devices, patients, and medical personnel. Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus were the predominant ESKAPE members. The analysis of intergenic regions revealed an important clonal distribution of A. baumannii (AdeABCRS+). Genotyping of SCCmec mobile genetic elements and the icaA gene showed that there is no clonal distribution of S. aureus.

There were more lung lobes involved on the first chest CT in COVID-19 patients, which were mostly distributed in the dorsal outer zone (23/26, 88.5%), and nearly half of them (12/26, 46.2%) were accompanied by crazy-paving sign; while the lesions in adult mycoplasma pneumonia patients were mostly distributed along the bronchi, and the bronchial wall was thickened (19/21, 90.5%), accompanied with tree buds / fog signs (19/21, 90.5%). The above CT signs were significantly different between the two kinds of pneumonia (all P<0.01). COVID-19 had a longer course compared with mycoplasma pneumonia, the disease peaks of COVID-19 patients was on day (10.5±3.8), while the disease on CT was almost absorbed on day (7.9±2.2) in adult mycoplasma pneumonia. The length of hospital stay in COVID-19 patients was significantly longer than that of mycoplasma pneumonia patients [(19.5±4.3) d vs (7.9±2.2) d, P<0.01]. CONCLUSIONS The lesions of adult mycoplasma pneumonia are mostly distributed along the bronchi with tree buds/fog signs, while the lesions of COVID-19 are mainly distributed in the dorsal outer zone accompanied by crazy-paving sign, which can early distinguish two diseases.","Huo, Xianluo; Xue, Xiaohua; Yuan, Shuhui; Zhang, Dianchun; Gao, Qing'e; Gong, Tao",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

The addition of plication of the stomach to LAGB should provide better appetite control, more effective weight loss, and greater weight loss potential. The purpose of the study was to analyze the outcomes of LAGBP at 18 months. METHODS Data from all patients who underwent a primary LAGBP procedure from December 2011 through June 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Data collected from each patient included age, gender, weight, body mass index (BMI), and excess weight loss (EWL). RESULTS Sixty-six patients underwent LAGBP. The mean age and BMI were 44.6 ± 12.7 years and 42.1 ± 5.1 kg/m2, respectively. The patients lost an average of 49% and 46.8% EWL at 12 months (77.2% follow-up) and 18 months (66.1% follow-up), respectively. The mean band adjustments were 2.1 ± 1.7 (range, 0-7) per patient in 1 year. The mean additional adjustment volume (infusion and withdrawal of saline) was 0.6 ± 1 cc. Dysphagia was the most common long-term complication. The band removal rate was 7.5%. The mortality rate was 0%. CONCLUSIONS LAGBP is a relatively safe and effective bariatric procedure. In light of recent studies demonstrating poor outcomes following LAGB, LAGBP may prove to be the future for patients desiring a bariatric procedure without resection of the stomach.","Billy, Helmuth; Surve, Amit; Fairley, Ryan; Cottam, Daniel; Cottam, Austin; Zaveri, Hinali; Cottam, Samuel",Obesity surgery,117,31

Here we review the management of diabetes in pregnancy before and during the lockdown. METHODS The majority of antenatal diabetes and obstetric visits are provided remotely, with pregnant women attending hospital clinics only for essential ultrasound scans and labour and delivery. On-line resources for supporting women planning pregnancy as well as for self-management of pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using intermittent or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) are provided. Retinal screening procedures, intrapartum care and the varying impact of lockdown on maternal glycaemic control are considered. Alternative screening procedures have for diagnosing hyperglycaemia during pregnancy and Gestational Diabetes (GDM) are discussed. Case histories describe the remote initiation of insulin pump therapy and automated insulin delivery in T1D pregnancy. RESULTS Initial feedback suggests that video consultations are well received and that the patient experiences for women requiring face-to-face visits are greatly improved. As the pandemic eases, formal evaluation of remote models of diabetes education and technology implementation, including women's views, will be important. CONCLUSIONS Research and audit activities will resume and we will find new ways for supporting pregnant women with diabetes to choose their preferred glucose monitoring and insulin delivery.","Murphy, Helen",Diabetes technology & therapeutics,117,20

TBI studies have segregated TBI injury into three severity groups: mild, moderate, and severe. While mild TBI is most frequent form in children and adults, there is debate over the indicators used to denote mild injury. Clinically, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are used to diagnose the TBI severity when medically warranted. Herein, we induced mild, moderate, and severe TBI in juvenile rats (jTBI) using the controlled cortical impact model. We characterized the temporal and spatial injury after graded jTBI in vivo using high-field MRI at 0.25 (6 hr), 1 and 3 days post-injury (dpi) with comparative histology. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) for blood and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) for edema were quantified over the 0.25-3 dpi. Edema volumes increased linearly with severity at 0.25 dpi that slowly continued to decrease over the 3 dpi. In contrast, blood volumes did not decrease over time. Mild TBI had the least amount of blood visible on SWI. Fluoro-jade B (FJB) staining for cell death confirmed increased cellular death with increasing severity and increased FJB + cells in the corpus callosum (CC). Interestingly, the strongest correlation was observed for cell death and the presence of extravascular blood. A clear understanding of acute brain injury (jTBI) and how blood/edema contribute to mild, moderate, and severe jTBI is needed prior to embarking on therapeutic interventions. Noninvasive imaging should be used in mild jTBI to verify lack of overt injury.","Badaut, Jerome; Adami, Arash; Huang, Lei; Obenaus, André",Journal of neuroscience research,117,5

In anticipation of surges in the need for critical care services, governments implemented ""lockdown"" measures to preserve and create added critical care capacity. Herein, we describe the impact of lockdown measures on the utilization of critical care services and patient outcomes compared with nonlockdown epochs in a large integrated health region. DESIGN This was a population-based retrospective cohort study. SETTING Seventeen adult ICUs across 14 acute care hospitals in Alberta, Canada. PATIENTS All adult (age ≥ 15 yr) patients admitted to any study ICU. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The main exposure was ICU admission during ""lockdown"" occurring between March 16, 2020, and June 30, 2020. This period was compared with two nonpandemic control periods: ""year prior"" (March 16, 2019, to June 30, 2019) and ""pre lockdown"" immediately prior (November 30, 2019, to March 15, 2020). The primary outcome was the number of ICU admissions. Secondary outcomes included the following: daily measures of ICU utilization, ICU duration of stay, avoidable delay in ICU discharge, and occupancy; and patient outcomes. Mixed multilevel negative binomial regression and interrupted time series regression were used to compare rates of ICU admissions between periods. Multivariable regressions were used to compare patient outcomes between periods. During the lockdown, there were 3,649 ICU admissions (34.1 [8.0] ICU admissions/d), compared with 4,125 (38.6 [9.3]) during the prelockdown period and 3,919 (36.6 [8.7]) during the year prior. Mean bed occupancy declined significantly during the lockdown compared with the nonpandemic periods (78.7%, 95.9%, and 96.4%; p < 0.001). Avoidable ICU discharge delay also decreased significantly (42.0%, 53.2%, and 58.3%; p < 0.001). During the lockdown, patients were younger, had fewer comorbid diseases, had higher acuity, and were more likely to be medical admissions compared with the nonpandemic periods. Adjusted ICU and hospital mortality and ICU and hospital lengths of stay were significantly lower during the lockdown compared with nonpandemic periods. CONCLUSIONS The coronavirus disease 2019 lockdown resulted in substantial changes to ICU utilization, including a reduction in admissions, occupancy, patient lengths of stay, and mortality.","Bagshaw, Sean M; Zuege, Danny J; Stelfox, Henry T; Opgenorth, Dawn; Wasylak, Tracy; Fraser, Nancy; Nguyen, Thanh X",Critical care medicine,117,1

In this study, several variants of PASylated uricase from the Aspergillus flavus species were analyzed computationally to find the appropriate fusions to solve short half-life and stability concern. The Ab initio method was performed using Rosetta software to structurally characterize the PAS sequences. The 3D structures of fusions were predicted for fused C- or N-terminally PAS sequences in different length to the uricase. The refinement and energy minimization steps revealed that physicochemical and conformational properties of fusions improved while the structures possessed prolonged PAS sequences. Molecular docking results showed that the highest binding affinity to uric acid belonged to uricase-PAS1-100 by the formation of six hydrogen and four non-hydrogen bonds. Altogether, the results indicated that the PASylation process would be promising upon the production of urate oxidase with improved solubility and stability.","Najjari, Abbas; Rahimi, Hamzeh; Nojoumi, Seyed Ali; Omidinia, Eskandar",International journal of molecular and cellular medicine,117,1

The primary reason for prescribing opioids is to treat pain. Women have more acute and chronic pain and have been prescribed these drugs in significantly greater numbers than men. Comparison of women and men with chronic pain also shows that women receive the majority of prescription opioids, and the use of these prescribed medications became the major pathway to misuse and addiction for women. Yet, recognition of the extent of women's exposure to opioids and the attendant consequences has been limited. Attempts to stem the overall tide of the epidemic focused on reducing the availability of prescription opioids. However, as these medications became more difficult to obtain and treatment opportunities were limited, many turned to other synthetic opioids, such as heroin and fentanyl. Thus, the public health crisis of opioid addiction has endured. This paper highlights the importance of understanding differences among women and men in opioid use and its biological and psychosocial effects to advance the gender-based treatment approaches and effective public health policy.","Goetz, Teddy G; Becker, Jill B; Mazure, Carolyn M",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,117,16

Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is a new technique developed for performing operations without a visible scar. Preliminary studies have reported the use of the technique mainly in cholecystectomy and appendectomy. We evaluated the feasibility of the technique in various appendicitis conditions including children, fertile women and obese patients. Materials and Methods. SILS technique was used in a random sample of patients hospitalised for suspected appendicitis. The ordinary diagnostic laparoscopy was performed and the appendix was removed if needed. The ligation of appendix was performed by thread loop, absorbable clip or endoscopic stapler. The details regarding the recovery of patients were collected prospectively. Results. Ten SILS procedures were performed without conversions or complications. The patient series included uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis patients. The mean age of the patients was 37 years (range 13-63), mean BMI was 26 (range 18-31), mean operative time was 40 minutes (range 18-31), and mean postoperative stay was 2 days (range 1-5). Conclusions. SILS technique is feasible for obese patients, uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis as well as for exploratory laparoscopy. Most common methods to ligate appendix are feasible with SILS technique. The true benefit of the technique should be assessed by randomised controlled trials.","Kössi, Jyrki; Luostarinen, Markku",Diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy,117,17

Histological and ultrastructural examination of Discothyrea sauterirevealed that each of these areas is associated with a novel exocrine gland: the proximal procoxal gland is formed by a cluster of 15 round secretory cells of 34 μm with numerous mitochondria, smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.Their ducts have a diameter of 0.5-1 μm.The distal procoxal gland contains 50 secretory cells of 22 μm with numerous vacuoles and lamellar inclusions, and narrow ducts with a diameter of only 0.15-0.2 μm.The differences in ultrastructural appearance and duct diameter indicate that both glands produce a different but probably pheromonal secretion. The function of these novel procoxal glands could not yet be determined, although observation of D.sauteri workers and queens shows that they make frequent and peculiar leg movements, in which the foreleg basitarsus rubs over the coxal hairy areas. The foreleg basitarsus then rubs the ipsilateral hindleg basitarsus and antenna. As a last step of the sequence, the hindleg basitarsus strokes the gaster.In addition to the occurrence of these novel procoxal glands, histological examination of D. sauteri also revealed the presence of yet another novel but smaller procoxal base gland. Ants of the 'testacea group', that have less developed frontal lobes and no antennal scrobes, do not have procoxal hairy areas, although a distinct sculpturation with small pores may occur in the corresponding areas. The related Proceratium japonicum, that has a similar lifestyle as Discothyrea, does not have any of the procoxal glands and does not display the peculiar leg movements as reported for D. sauteri.","Billen, Johan; Lin, Chung-Chi; Esteves, Flavia A",Arthropod structure & development,117,29

METHODS We prospectively evaluated all elective TLHs (with or without adnexectomy) performed for fibromatous uteri between August 2009 and August 2019 in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sirai Hospital, Carbonia, and the Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Businco Hospital, Azienda Ospedaliera Brotzu, Cagliari. Patients with large myomatous uteri (uterine weight ≥ 1.5 kg on pathology reports) were included in the analysis. We examined all procedures and collected data about intra- and post-operative short-term and long-term complications, intraoperative blood loss, operative time, hospital stay, and time to achieve well-being. RESULTS Seventy-eight patients were included. The median weight was 2,000 g (range 1,500-11,000 g), estimated blood loss was 100 mL (range 10-700 mL), operating time was 135 min (range 60-300 min), and hospital stay was 2 days (range 2-5 days). Conversion to laparotomy occurred in 4 patients (5.1%) with uterine weight ranging from 3 to 5.5 kg, due to severe adherence syndrome or inadequate visualization. As for intraoperative complications, 1 patient (who had the largest removed uterus weighing 11,000 g) experienced an intraoperative ureteral injury (grade III). No major postoperative complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS This study provides the largest case series of TLH for fibromatous uteri > 1.5 kg and includes some of the largest uteri reported to date in the literature (weighing 5,320, 5,720, and 11,000 g, respectively). The study reaffirms the feasibility and safety of a minimally invasive hysterectomy even in the case of abnormally large uteri.","Macciò, Antonio; Chiappe, Giacomo; Kotsonis, Paraskevas; Lavra, Fabrizio; Sanna, Elisabetta; Collu, Ivan; Nemolato, Sonia; Madeddu, Clelia",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,117,6

METHODS Subjects were recruited and classified into one of the following four groups: normal controls (n = 52), diabetes without DR (n = 49), non-proliferative DR (n = 51) and proliferative DR (n = 38). Using OCTA, the superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP) and the choriocapillaris vessel densities were measured and compared in different macular areas: the fovea (1-mm diameter circular area), parafovea (1-3-mm diameter ring) and perifovea (3-6-mm ring). RESULTS With DR progression, vessel densities in the SCP and DCP as well as the choriocapillaris decreased, while the foveal avascular zone area increased (p < 0.001 for all). Compared with controls, the SCP and DCP vessel densities of the diabetes without DR group were decreased in all areas of the macula (p < 0.020 for all), while the choriocapillaris vessel density was decreased only in the perifoveal area (p = 0.823 for the foveal area; p = 0.631 for the parafoveal area; p = 0.039 for the perifoveal area). Multivariate linear regression analyses revealed that all retinal and choroidal microvascular indices were significantly associated with the DR severity. CONCLUSION The morphological changes in the macular microvasculature were associated with DR severity. Also, the changes were found to be more vulnerable in the retinal capillary plexuses than the choriocapillaris.","Ryu, Gahyung; Kim, Inhye; Sagong, Min",Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,117,1

Cerebral, mesenteric, and renal arterial blood flow velocities were measured with Doppler USG before and after the treatment. Results: While cerebral, mesenteric, and renal fractional oxygen extraction (FTOE) measurements decreased significantly (p = .042, p < .001, p < .001, respectively), NIRS measurements (p = .016, p < .001, p < .001, respectively) and mean blood flow velocities (p = .003, p = .011, p = .002, respectively) increased significantly after the treatment. There was a significant correlation between pretreatment cerebral and mesenteric FTOE and resistive index (RI) values (r = 0.45, p = .01, and r = 0.46, p = .01, respectively). However, no correlation was observed between renal FTOE values and renal RI (r = 0.33, p = .06). Posttreatment cerebral, renal, and mesenteric FTOE values correlated positively with corresponding RI (r = 0.41, p = .02; r = 0.39, p = .02; r = 0.65, p < 01; respectively). Pretreatment and posttreatment cerebral, mesenteric, and renal FTOE values and arterial mean velocities were inversely correlated (pretreatment: r = 0.69, p < .01; r = 0.72, p < .01; r = 0.77, p < .01; posttreatment: r = 0.54, p = .01; r = 0.69, p < .01; r = 0.38, p = .01; respectively). Conclusion: As Doppler and NIRS measurements correlated significantly, we concluded that NIRS might be used in monitoring organ blood flow in preterm infants with PDA, which may provide additional data for management of this condition.","Arman, Didem; Sancak, Selim; Gürsoy, Tugba; Topcuoğlu, Sevilay; Karatekin, Güner; Ovalı, Fahri","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",117,19

A secondary aim was to assess the implementation and reporting of the exercise testing protocols. CINAHL, Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane CENTRAL databases were searched. Randomised controlled trials whereby patients with intermittent claudication were randomised to an exercise intervention were included. The terminology used to describe maximal walking distance was recorded, as was the modality and protocol used to measure it. The implementation and reporting quality was also assessed using pre-specified criteria. Sixty-four trials were included in this review. Maximal walking distance was reported using fourteen different terminologies. Twenty-two different treadmill protocols and three different corridor tests were employed to assess maximal walking distance. No single trial satisfied all the implementation and reporting criteria for an exercise testing protocol. Evidence shows that between-study interpretation is difficult given the heterogenous nature of the exercise testing protocols, test endpoints and terminology used to describe maximal walking distance. This is further compounded by poor test reporting and implementation across studies. Comprehensive guidelines need to be provided to enable a standardised approach to exercise testing in patients with intermittent claudication.","Birkett, Stefan T; Harwood, Amy E; Caldow, Edward; Ibeggazene, Saïd; Ingle, Lee; Pymer, Sean",PloS one,117,1

Here, we identified an inducible lncRNA in the Cxcl2 gene locus, lnc-Cxcl2, which could selectively inhibit Cxcl2 expression in mouse lung epithelial cells but not in macrophages. lnc-Cxcl2-deficient mice exhibited increased Cxcl2 expression, enhanced neutrophils recruitment, and more severe inflammation in the lung after influenza virus infection. Mechanistically, nucleus-localized lnc-Cxcl2 bound to Cxcl2 promoter, recruited a ribonucleoprotein La, which inhibited the chromatin accessibility of chemokine promoters, and consequently inhibited Cxcl2 transcription in cis However, unlike mouse lnc-Cxcl2, human lnc-CXCL2-4-1 inhibited multiple immune cytokine expressions including chemokines in human lung epithelial cells. Together, our results demonstrate a self-protecting mechanism within epithelial cells to restrain chemokine and neutrophil-mediated inflammation, providing clues for better understanding chemokine regulation and epithelial cell function in lung viral infection.","Liu, Shuo; Liu, Jiaqi; Yang, Xue; Jiang, Minghong; Wang, Qingqing; Zhang, Lianfeng; Ma, Yuanwu; Shen, Zhongyang; Tian, Zhigang; Cao, Xuetao",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,117,1

Bumblebee queens are a critical point in the lifecycle of their colony, since its future success is reliant on a single individual's ability to learn about floral stimuli while finding a suitable nest site; thus, one might expect particularly adept learning capabilities at this stage. I compared wild Bombus vosnesenskii queens and workers on their ability to learn a colour association and found that queens performed better than workers. In addition, queens of another species, B. insularis, a cuckoo species with a different lifecycle but similar requirements at this stage, performed equally well as the non-parasitic queens. To control for differences in foraging experience, I then repeated this comparison with laboratory-based B. impatiens and found that unmated queens performed better than workers.

There is an urgent need to continue to deliver outpatient care for chronic neurological disease and teleneurology has the potential to fulfill this gap. Introduction: This study reports the implementation and utilization of teleneurology across all neurological subspecilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective observational study that identified all in-person and teleneurology outpatient nonprocedural visits from January 5 to April 4, 2020, across neurological specialties at a single academic center. Visit volumes were assessed weekly and practice patterns were compared before and after March 15, 2020, as this was the date of a major statewide stay-at-home order in Ohio. Results: Before March 15 the mean in-person visit per week was 5129.4 and decreased to 866.7 after that date. The mean teleneurology visits per week increased from 209.1 to 2619.3 for the same time period. The overall teleneurology visit volume in the 3 weeks after March 15 increased by 533%. Discussion: In a relatively short time frame of 3 weeks, a single academic center was able to dramatically increase teleneurology visits to provide outpatient neurological care. Conclusions: This study demonostrates that teleneruology can be a solution for outpatient neurological care in the context of COVID-19. The increased utilization of teleneurology during this crisis has the potential to expand teleneurology and improve access to neurological care in the future outside the pandemic setting.","McGinley, Marisa P; Ontaneda, Daniel; Wang, Zhini; Weber, Malory; Shook, Steven; Stanton, Matthew; Bermel, Robert",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,117,0

MATERIALS AND METHODS The records of all patients with osteoid osteomas of the spine managed with thermal ablation at two academic centers from 1993 to 2008 were reviewed. RESULTS Seventeen patients (13 male patients, four female patients; mean age, 25.9 years) had lesions in the lumbar (seven patients), thoracic (six patients), cervical (three patients), and sacral (one patient) regions of the spine. Two lesions were in the vertebral body, one was within the dens, and the others were in the posterior elements. The mean lesion diameter was 8.8 mm, and the mean distance between the lesion and the closest neural element was 4.3 mm. The lesions were managed with laser (13 lesions) or radiofrequency (four lesions) ablation. Special thermal protection techniques involving the epidural injection of gas or cooled fluid were used. Pain levels were assessed immediately before the procedure and on the day after the procedure. Long-term follow-up findings were available for 11 patients. No complications were encountered, and all patients reported relief of pain. The 11 patients who participated in long-term follow-up reported continued relief of pain. CONCLUSION Percutaneous thermal ablation can be used to manage spinal osteoid osteomas close to the neural elements.

METHODS The case of a man with SARS-CoV-2 infection and complicated acute otitis media with facial paralysis is presented to illustrate unique clinical decisions made in context of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cadaveric temporal bone was used to simulate droplet spread during suctioning of fluorescein-labelled middle ear fluid and visualized with a blue-light filter. RESULTS A 23-year-old male who presented with complicated acute otitis media with facial paralysis was found to have an acute infection with SARS-CoV-2, with positive viral PCR of nasopharyngeal swab, and a negative PCR of the middle ear fluid. He was placed on isolation precautions and treated with myringotomy, topical and systemic antibiotics, and antivirals. Consistent with observations during endonasal suctioning, suctioning of middle ear fluid was not found to be aerosol or droplet generating. CONCLUSION The case of a patient with active COVID-19 presenting with complicated acute otitis media in whom middle ear fluid was sampled to evaluate the etiology of the infection and the potential middle ear predilection of SARS-CoV-2 is described. This study has implications for the clinical management of patients with both known and unknown SARS-CoV-2 infection who present with ear disease. While middle ear suctioning may not be aerosol-generating, the risk of coughing or prolonged close contact requires heightened precautions during otologic procedures in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.","Mohan, Suresh; Workman, Alan; Barshak, Miriam; Welling, D Bradley; Abdul-Aziz, Dunia","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",117,27

We aimed to investigate whether the ablation technique used for PVI impacts S100B release in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS AND RESULTS The study population consisted of 73 consecutive patients (age: 62.7 ± 10.9 years, 54.8% males) undergoing first-time PVI with either radiofrequency (RF; n = 30) or cryoballoon (CB; n = 43) for paroxysmal AF. S100B determined from venous plasma samples taken immediately before and after PVI increased from 33.5 ± 1.8 to 91.1 ± 5.3 pg/mL (P < 0.0001). S100B release in patients undergoing CB-PVI was 3.9 times higher compared to patients with RF-PVI (ΔS100B: 21.1 ± 2.7 vs. 83.1 ± 5.2 pg/mL, P < 0.0001). During a mean follow-up of 314 ± 186 days, AF recurrences were observed in 18/71 (25.4%) patients (RF-PVI: n = 9/28, CB-PVI: n = 9/43). Univariate Cox regression analysis indicated that an increase in S100B was associated with higher freedom from AF in follow-up (hazard ratio per 10 pg/mL release of S100B: 0.83; 95% confidence interval: 0.72-0.95; P = 0.007). CONCLUSION The ablation technique used for PVI has an impact on the release of S100B, a well-established biomarker for neural damage.","Scherschel, Katharina; Hedenus, Katja; Jungen, Christiane; Münkler, Paula; Willems, Stephan; Anwar, Omar; Klatt, Niklas; Eickholt, Christian; Meyer, Christian","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",117,1

For this information to be propagated through cell cycles, parental histones and their PTMs need to be maintained at the same genomic locations. Yet, during DNA replication, every nucleosome in the genome is disrupted to allow passage of the replisome. Recent data have identified histone chaperone activities that are intrinsic components of the replisome and implicate them in maintaining parental histones during DNA replication. We propose that structural and kinetic coordination between DNA replication and replisome-associated histone chaperone activities ensures positional inheritance of histones and their PTMs. When this coordination is perturbed, histones may instead be recycled to random genomic locations by alternative histone chaperones.","Francis, Nicole J; Sihou, Djamouna",Trends in biochemical sciences,117,1

To date however no review exists to identify, map and analyse the literature in this area in order to understand 1) which marginalised groups have been studied in terms of patient safety research, 2) what the particular patient safety issues are for such groups and 3) what contributes to or is associated with these safety issues arising. METHODS Scoping review. Systematic searches were performed across six electronic databases in September 2019. The time frame for searches of the respective databases was from the year 2000 until present day. RESULTS The searches yielded 3346 articles, and 67 articles were included. Patient safety issues were identified for fourteen different marginalised patient groups across all studies, with 69% (n = 46) of the studies focused on four patient groups: ethnic minority groups, frail elderly populations, care home residents and low socio-economic status. Twelve separate patient safety issues were classified. Just over half of the studies focused on three issues represented in the patient safety literature, and in order of frequency were: medication safety, adverse outcomes and near misses. In total, 157 individual contributing or associated factors were identified and mapped to one of seven different factor types from the Framework of Contributory Factors Influencing Clinical Practice within the London Protocol. Patient safety issues were mostly multifactorial in origin including patient factors, health provider factors and health care system factors. CONCLUSIONS This review highlights that marginalised patient groups are vulnerable to experiencing a variety patient safety issues and points to a number of gaps. The findings indicate the need for further research to understand the intersectional nature of marginalisation and the multi-dimensional nature of patient safety issues, for groups that have been under-researched, including those with mental health problems, communication and cognitive impairments.

In this study, we performed an extensive multi-omics data mining and identified four insulin-like peptide genes, including ILP, MIRP3, MIRP3-like and ILP7, in the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. Their potential roles in growth regulation were further investigated using the selectively bred fast-growing C. gigas variety ""Haida No.1"". Expression profiling and in situ hybridization of these insulin-like peptides suggested their distinct tissue-specific expression pattern, with dominant expression in the neural enrichment tissues such as labial palp, visceral ganglia, adductor muscle, and digestive gland. The expressions of insulin-like peptides were significantly altered by food abundance in a gene-specific fashion. The expression of ILP was reduced during fasting and increased after re-feeding, the expression of MIRP3 and ILP7 were generally induced during fasting and down-regulated after re-feeding, while the expression of MIRP3-like was firstly up-regulated and then down-regulated during the fasting and re-feeding process. Furthermore, the expressions of all four insulin-like peptide genes were significantly suppressed at low temperature, in accordance with the growth inhibition. These results indicated that all four insulin-like peptides would play critical but different roles in regulation of growth in the oysters.

Regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) derived from near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a surrogate for cerebral blood flow and can be used to calculate cerebral autoregulation (CA) continuously at the bedside from the derived cerebral oximetry index (COx). We hypothesized that COx derived thresholds for CA are associated with outcomes in patients with acute coma from neurological injury. METHODS A prospective cohort study was conducted in 88 acutely comatose adults with heterogenous brain injury diagnoses who were continuously monitored with COx for up to 3 consecutive days. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to investigate association between averaged COx and short (in-hospital and 3 mo) and long-term (6 mo) outcomes. RESULTS Six month mortality rate was 62%. Median COx in nonsurvivors at hospital discharge was 0.082 [interquartile range, IQR: 0.045 to 0.160] compared with 0.042 [IQR: -0.005 to 0.110] in survivors (P=0.012). At 6 months, median COx was 0.075 [IQR: 0.27 to 0.158] in nonsurvivors compared with 0.029 [IQR: -0.015 to 0.077] in survivors (P=0.02). In the multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for confounders, average COx ≥0.05 was associated with both in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=2.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.15-7.33, P=0.02), mortality at 6 months (adjusted OR=4.4, 95% CI=1.41-13.7, P=0.01), and severe disability (modified Rankin Score ≥4) at 6 months (adjusted OR=4.4, 95% CI=1.07-17.8, P=0.04). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting mortality and severe disability at 6 months were 0.783 and 0.825, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Averaged COx ≥0.05 is independently associated with short and long-term mortality and long-term severe disability in acutely comatose adults with neurological injury. We propose that COx ≥0.05 represents an accurate threshold to predict long-term functional outcome in acutely comatose adults.","Rivera-Lara, Lucia; Geocadin, Romegryko; Zorrilla-Vaca, Andres; Healy, Ryan; Radzik, Batya R; Palmisano, Caitlin; White, Mirinda A; Sha, Dhaval; Ponce-Mejia, Luciano; Brown, Charles; Hogue, Charles; Ziai, Wendy C",Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,117,31

Outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Patient and tumor characteristics were similar between the LESS-N and C-N groups. The mean operative duration was longer in the LESS-N than in the C-N group (231.0 ± 26.7 min versus 188.6 ± 36.4 min; p = .025). The mean estimated blood loss was lower in the LESS-N compared with the C-N group (26.4 ± 14.4 ml versus 65.6 ± 45.2 ml; p = .047). Postoperative complications were observed in three cases, comprising one case of retroperitoneal hematoma in the LESS-N group and one case each of peritoneal hematoma and retroperitoneal abscess in the C-N group.

They also had more severely impaired EF according to the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), more difficulties and disturbances in the family by the Chinese version of Family Environment Scale (FES-CV), and lower parenting efficacy and satisfaction by Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC). With regard to the self-rating questionnaires of children and adolescents, the HDOL group reported lower learning motivation according to the Students Learning Motivation Scale (SLMS). By Screening for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders and Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children (DSRSC), those in HDOL presented more negative emotions. The HDOL group spent significantly more time on both video games and social software per day and significantly less time on multiple activities per week, when compared to those in the LDOL group. This study demonstrated that ADHD children and adolescents with HDOL had more inattention-related behaviors, more severe emotional problems and EF impairment, weaker learning motivation, and poorer family and parenting environment. Meanwhile, digital media use should be supervised and appropriate extracurricular activities should be encouraged by parents and schools.","He, Shan; Shuai, Lan; Wang, Zhouye; Qiu, Meihui; Wilson, Amanda; Xia, Weiping; Cao, Xuan; Lu, Lu; Zhang, Jinsong","Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing",117,7

The outbreak, confirmed on the New Year's Eve 2020, has known no boundaries since then. The number has surpassed that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and is uninterruptedly escalating. Being an RNA virus, it has a propensity to mutate due to the low proofreading capacity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Step-wise mutations have led to the gradual spillover of virus and after crossing the inter-species interface, the virus has adapted itself for a stable human-to-human transmission. The disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can prove deadlier if the so-called 'super-spreading events' emerge with time. Recent research has shown the maximum homology of 99% of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins associated coronavirus, owing to which these can serve as potential intermediate host. India is responding swiftly to the emergency situation, and the whole of the country is under lockdown since 25 March 2020, to ensure social distancing. All the international flights are padlocked and the travellers are being screened at airports and seaports via thermal sensors, and quarantine for a period of 14 days is recommended. Three hundred and forty-five patients across the country tested positive with six fatalities as of 22 March 2020. No specific anti-CoV drugs are currently available. Patients are being treated with protease drugs are inhibitors, remdesivir, chloroquine, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibitors, ivermectin, sarilumab and tocilizumab, though none of these is Food and Drug Administration approved and are undergoing trials. Preventive measures such as social distancing, quarantine, cough etiquettes, proper hand washing, cleaning and decontaminating the surfaces are the mainstay for curbing the transmission of this virus.

METHOD Longitudinal, mixed methods cohort study of adolescents aged 13-17 years recruited within 6 weeks of sexual assault (study entry) and followed to study end, 13-15 months post-assault. RESULTS 75/141 participants were followed to study end (53% retention; 71 females) and 19 completed an in-depth qualitative interview. Despite many participants accessing support services, 54%, 59% and 72% remained at risk for depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders 13-15 months post-assault. Physical symptoms were reported more frequently. Persistent (> 30 days) absence from school doubled between study entry and end, from 22 to 47%. Enduring mental ill-health and disengagement from education/employment were associated with psychosocial risk factors rather than assault characteristics. Qualitative data suggested inter-relationships between mental ill-health, physical health problems and disengagement from school, and poor understanding from schools regarding how to support young people post-assault. Baseline levels of smoking, alcohol and ever drug use were high and increased during the study period (only significantly for alcohol use). CONCLUSION Adolescents presenting after sexual assault have high levels of vulnerability over a year post-assault. Many remain at risk for mental health disorders, highlighting the need for specialist intervention and ongoing support. A key concern for young people is disruption to their education. Multi-faceted support is needed to prevent social exclusion and further widening of health inequalities in this population, and to support young people in their immediate and long-term recovery.","Clarke, Venetia; Goddard, Andrea; Wellings, Kaye; Hirve, Raeena; Casanovas, Marta; Bewley, Susan; Viner, Russell; Kramer, Tami; Khadr, Sophie",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,117,1

A recent direction in drug development is the utilization of nucleic acid-based therapeutic molecules, such as antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, short interfering RNA (siRNA), and microRNA (miRNA). miRNAs are endogenous, short, non-coding RNA molecules. Some viruses encode their own miRNAs, which play pivotal roles in viral replication and immune evasion strategies. Conversely, viruses that do not encode miRNAs may manipulate host cell miRNAs for the benefits of their replication. miRNAs have therefore become attractive tools for the study of viral pathogenesis. Lately, novel therapeutic strategies based on miRNA technology for the treatment of viral diseases have been progressing rapidly. Although this new generation of molecular therapy is promising, there are still several challenges to face, such as targeting delivery to specific tissues, avoiding off-target effects of miRNAs, reducing the toxicity of the drugs, and overcoming mutations and drug resistance. In this article, we review the current knowledge of the role and therapeutic potential of miRNAs in viral diseases, and discuss the limitations of these therapies, as well as strategies to overcome them to provide safe and effective clinical applications of these new therapeutics.","Hemida, Maged Gomaa; Ye, Xin; Thair, Simone; Yang, Decheng",Molecular diagnosis & therapy,117,19

Although electroencephalography is the gold standard epilepsy biomarker, it is rarely used in post-stroke studies, and the frequency of post-stroke epileptiform activity is still uncertain. Patients and methods We analysed studies indexed to MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO and OpenGrey (up to March 2015), reporting post-stroke electroencephalographic epileptiform activity frequency in adults. Epileptiform activity was classified as ictal (electrographic seizures) and interictal (non-periodic spikes and sharp waves). Data selection, extraction and appraisal were done in duplicate. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool frequencies. Results The pooled frequency of post-stroke ictal and interictal epileptiform activity was 7% (95% CI 3%-12%) and 8% (95% CI 4%-13%), respectively. The use of continuous electroencephalogram was not associated with an increased frequency of electrographic seizures (p = 0.05), nor did the management setting (Intensive Care Unit versus non- Intensive Care Unit, p = 0.31). However, studies with continuous electroencephalogram showed a higher frequency of interictal epileptiform activity (p = 0.01). Discussion This study provides the best available estimates of the frequency of post-stroke electroencephalographic epileptiform activity. Due to detection bias, it was not possible to correlate clinical and electrographic seizures. Conclusion The frequency of ictal and interictal epileptiform activity in the electroencephalogram was comparable with previous frequency analyses of clinical seizures. The frequency of ictal epileptiform activity did not change with continuous record or clinical setting, while the frequency of interictal epileptiform activity increased with continuous record.","Bentes, Carla; Rodrigues, Filipe B; Sousa, Diana; Duarte, Gonçalo S; Franco, Ana C; Marques, Raquel; Nzwalo, Hipólito; Peralta, Ana R; Ferro, José M; Costa, João",European stroke journal,117,1

We investigated the influence of personal protective equipment on out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. METHODS Randomised controlled non-inferiority triple-crossover study. Forty-eight emergency medical service providers, randomized into teams of two, performed 12 minutes of basic life support (BLS) on a manikin after climbing 3 flights of stairs. Three scenarios were completed in a randomised order: Without personal protective equipment, with personal protective equipment including a filtering face piece (FFP) 2 mask with valve, and with personal protective equipment including an FFP2 mask without valve. The primary outcome was mean depth of chest compressions with a pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 3.5 mm. Secondary outcomes included other measurements of CPR quality, providers' subjective exhaustion levels, and providers' vital signs, including end-tidal CO2. RESULTS Differences regarding the primary outcome were well below the pre-defined non-inferiority margins for both control vs. personal protective equipment without valve (absolute difference 1 mm, 95% CI [-1, 2]) and control vs. personal protective equipment with valve (absolute difference 1 mm, [-0.2, 2]). This was also true for secondary outcomes regarding quality of chest compressions and providers' vital signs including etCO2. Subjective physical strain after BLS was higher in the personal protective equipment groups (Borg 4 (SD 3) without valve, 4 (SD 2) with valve) than in the control group (Borg 3 (SD 2)). CONCLUSION PPE including masks with and without expiration valve is safe for use without concerns regarding the impairment of CPR quality.","Kienbacher, Calvin Lukas; Grafeneder, Jürgen; Tscherny, Katharina; Krammel, Mario; Fuhrmann, Verena; Niederer, Maximilian; Neudorfsky, Sabine; Herbich, Klaus; Schreiber, Wolfgang; Herkner, Harald; Roth, Dominik",Resuscitation,117,20

Methods: All patients who underwent telemedicine visits at one urban academic medical center between March 2020 and June 2020 were included. All departments were included including surgical and nonsurgical. Demographic data, primary language, and visit type were collected. Primary zip code was used as surrogate for socioeconomic status through use of the zip code median household income. The demographics of the New York metropolitan area were obtained through the U.S. Census Bureau and used as a control cohort. Results: A total of 362,413 telemedicine visits met inclusion criteria with the majority of visits performed in April and May; 127,851 (35.3%) and 110,166 (30.4%), respectively. The highest performing department was Internal Medicine, which performed 72,796 visits or 20% of the total cohort. In our cohort of telemedicine patients, 59.6% identified as White, 11.4% as Black, and 5.7% as Asian. This is less diverse than the overall population of the metropolitan area, which is 17.5% Black and 11.5% Asian. There was also a large gender gap in the utilization of telemedicine services in general, where women (60.2%) were more likely than men (39.8%) to utilize the virtual visits. In addition, although over a third of patients in the Metropolitan area have median household incomes of <50,000, this population only represented 13.6% of our total cohort. Conclusions: This study highlights both the capability of telemedicine to provide care at a large urban academic medical center during a pandemic in addition to identifying potential gaps in care with telemedicine. The disparities highlighted in our cohort stress the importance of outreach to non-White older patients of lower socioeconomic status.","Lott, Ariana; Campbell, Kirk A; Hutzler, Lorraine; Lajam, Claudette M",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,117,24

Replication of the virus lacking NB was not different to wild-type virus with full-length NB in clonal immortalized or complex primary cell cultures. In the mouse model, virus lacking NB induced slightly lower IFN-α levels in infected lungs, but this did not affect virus titres or weight loss. In ferrets infected with a mixture of viruses that did or did not express NB, there was no fitness advantage for the virus that retained NB. Moreover, virus lacking NB protein was transmitted following respiratory droplet exposure of sentinel animals.

Up to now, however, the efficacy of school closure to reduce the spread of the disease in the community still remains unclear and no much is known about the potential negative effects of such measures on physical health and psychological wellbeing of youths, mainly if protracted for long periods. OBJECTIVE To summarize the data of a systematic review on the impact of the 2020 school closure and social distances measures implemented in response to covid-19 pandemic on youths' physical health and psychological wellbeing. In the present paper we describe the impact on psychological wellbeing. METHODS We searched 11 international databases up to 1st September 2020 to retrieve cohort studies, cross sectional surveys, uncontrolled pre-post studies and modelling studies. Methodological quality of included studies has been assessed with validated checklists. RESULTS Sixty-four studies have been included; 27 assessed the impact on psychological wellbeing. All the studies have been conducted during the first wave of pandemic and assessed the short-term effect of social distances measures implemented for relatively short periods. The majority of the studies were conducted in the UK (37,6%) and China (27%). The 42.3% has been judged of high methodological quality. Two studies reported an increase of suicides, while two studies reported a reduction of the access to Psychiatric Emergency Department, Maltreatment allegations decreased substantially, likely due to a reduction in reports rather than actual incidence. Prevalence of anxiety among adolescents ranged between 19% and 64%, depression between 22.3% and 43.7%. Among children 5-12 years old, prevalence of anxiety varied between 19% and 78%, while depression between 6.3% and 22.6%. Among pre-school children, some studies found worsening of behavioural and emotional problems while others did not. CONCLUSIONS Most of the studies reported relevant worsening of the psychological wellbeing, mainly among adolescents. If school closure and rigid social distances measures will extend for a long time, an even more pronounced negative effect can be expected. Further studies are needed on the long-term effect of prolonged social distances measures, as well as a careful harm-benefit analysis of the impact of such measures.","Minozzi, Silvia; Saulle, Rosella; Amato, Laura; Davoli, Marina",Recenti progressi in medicina,117,16

METHODS Trained male cyclists were randomized to BG (N = 19) or placebo (P; N = 17) groups and under double-blind procedures received BG (5.6 g x d(-1)) or P beverage supplements for 2 wk before, during, and 1 d after a 3-d period in which subjects cycled for 3 h x d(-1) at approximately 57% maximal watts. URTI symptoms were monitored during BG supplementation and for 2 wk afterward. Blood samples were collected before and after 2 wk of supplementation (both samples, 8:00 a.m.), immediately after the 3-h exercise bout on day 3 (6:00 p.m.), and 14 h after exercise (8:00 a.m.) and were assayed for natural killer cell activity (NKCA), polymorphonuclear respiratory burst activity (PMN-RBA), phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation (PHA-LP), plasma interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, IL-1 receptor agonist (IL-1ra), and IL-8, and blood leukocyte IL-10, IL-8, and IL-1ra mRNA expression.

It is emphasized that the direct target of the virus is ACE2 underlining the obvious difference with ACE. Nevertheless, we hypothesized that a back load build up effect on Ang II may usurp the ACE capacity and subsequently leave the bradykinin system unabated. We think there are clinical clues for dry cough and the presumed aggravating role of ACE inhibitors like captopril on the disease process. Thereby, we speculated that inhibition of bradykinin synthesis and/or blockade of bradykinin B2 receptor using Aprotinin/ecallantide and Icatibant, respectively, may hold therapeutic promise in severe cases and these molecules can be advanced to clinical trials.","Ghahestani, Seyed-Mohammad; Mahmoudi, Javad; Hajebrahimi, Sakineh; Sioofy-Khojine, Amir-Babak; Salehi-Pourmehr, Hanieh; Sadeghi-Ghyassi, Fatemeh; Mostafaei, Hadi","Iranian journal of allergy, asthma, and immunology",117,24

Preintervention cerebrovascular blood volume (CBV) has been shown to predict outcomes in patients undergoing intra-arterial stroke therapies. OBJECTIVE To determine whether CBV can predict hemorrhagic transformation and clinical outcomes in patients selected for endovascular therapy for acute ischemic middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke using a CT perfusion (CTP)-based imaging protocol. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed cases of acute ischemic stroke due to MCA M1 segment occlusion and correlated favorable clinical outcomes (modified Rankin scale (mRS) ≤2) and radiographic outcomes with preintervention CBV values. All patients underwent whole-brain (320-detector-row) CTP imaging, and absolute CBV values of the affected and contralateral MCA territories were obtained separately for the cortical and basal ganglia regions. RESULTS Relative CBV (rCBV) of the MCA cortical regions was significantly lower in patients with poor clinical outcomes than in those with favorable clinical outcomes (0.87±0.21 vs 1.02±0.09, p=0.0003), and a negative correlation was found between rCBV values and mRS score severity. rCBV of the basal ganglia region was significantly lower in patients with hemorrhagic infarction (p=0.004) and parenchymal hematoma (p=0.04) than in those without hemorrhagic transformation. CONCLUSIONS We found that cortical CBV loss is predictive of poor clinical outcomes, whereas basal ganglia CBV loss is predictive of hemorrhagic transformation but without translation into poor clinical outcomes. Our study findings support published results of baseline preintervention CBV as a predictor of outcomes in patients undergoing intra-arterial stroke therapies.","Mokin, Maxim; Morr, Simon; Fanous, Andrew A; Shallwani, Hussain; Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Levy, Elad I; Snyder, Kenneth V; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,117,31

SPKT leads to materials exhibiting superior thermal and photostability compared to non-kinetically trapped materials of the same precursors. Transient absorption spectroscopy of the kinetically trapped material reveals improved optical properties: greater absorption, and longer ground-state bleach lifetimes.

The prevalence of acute maternal infections identifies cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, toxoplasmosis, and varicella as the most common organisms and in the order of frequency. Maternal informed consent and understanding is required before intrauterine testing for fetal infectious and possible genetic risk assessment. METHODS This structured review of the reproductive published literature focuses on the risks of amniocentesis and cordocentesis diagnostic procedure-related fetal loss rates and fetal vertical transmission (VT) rates from published infected pregnant cohorts. RESULTS The total postprocedure fetal loss rate for diagnostic amniocentesis procedures, in limited infectious cohorts, is 1.5% and does not appear to be increased compared to ""noninfected"" amniocentesis cohorts using an estimated background spontaneous fetal loss rate (no procedure) of 0.65%. The ""pooled"" unintended fetal loss rate is from small infected population cohorts, but can be used for counseling purposes. Postcordocentesis fetal loss risk, in an infected cohort, is not possible to estimate due to limited data. The ""biological spontaneous fetal loss rate"" risk with a perinatal infection (positive or negative fetal anomalies) and no diagnostic procedure before 20 weeks of gestation is reviewed. The risk of VT in acute infection cohorts as a result of the intra-amniotic diagnostic procedure is not found to be increased. CONCLUSION The unintended ""fetal loss"" rate after amniocentesis for perinatal infected cohorts is similar to that of noninfected cohorts, but the estimate is based on limited infected cohorts. There was no procedure-based risk of fetal VT in the infected cohorts, but identification of postprocedure maternal bleeding into the amniotic cavity increases the potential risk. Maternal knowledge translation and an informed consent process with risk-benefit maternal/fetal risk counseling are required prior to any diagnostic amniocentesis procedure.","Wilson, R Douglas",Fetal diagnosis and therapy,117,27

Methods: Eslicarbazepine acetate suspension (40 mg/mL) was prepared using Aptiom tablets after optimizing the tablet crushing methods and the vehicle composition. A stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed to monitor the eslicarbazepine stability in the prepared suspension. Three enteric feeding tubes of various composition and dimensions were evaluated for the delivery of the suspensions. The suspension was evaluated for the physical and chemical stability for 48 hours. Results: The reproducibility and consistency of particle size reduction was found to be best with standard mortar/pestle. The viscosity analysis and physical stability studies showed that ORA-Plus:water (50:50 v/v) was optimal for suspending ability and flowability of suspension through the tubes. The developed HPLC method was found to be stability indicating and suitable for the assay of eslicarbazepine acetate in the prepared suspension. The eslicarbazepine concentrations in separately prepared suspensions were within acceptable range (±3%), indicating accuracy and reproducibility of the procedure. The eslicarbazepine concentrations in suspensions before and after delivery through the enteric feeding tubes were within acceptable range (±4%), indicating absence of any physical/chemical interactions of eslicarbazepine with the tubes and a successful delivery of eslicarbazepine dosage via enteric feeding tubes. The stability study results showed that eslicarbazepine concentration in the suspension remained unchanged when stored at room temperature for 48 hours.

METHODS This post-hoc analysis included patients with unknown onset stroke randomized to treatment with alteplase or placebo in the WAKE-UP trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01525290), in whom a composite endpoint of PSD was defined as a Beck Depression Inventory BDI ≥10, medication with an antidepressant, or depression recorded as an adverse event. We used multiple logistic regression to identify predictors of PSD at 90 days. Structural equation modelling was applied to assess the indirect effect of thrombolysis on PSD mediated by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). RESULTS Information on the composite endpoint was available for 438 of 503 randomized patients. PSD was present in 96 of 224 (42.9%) patients in the alteplase group and 115 of 214 (53.7%) in the placebo group (OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.43-0.94; p=0.022; adjusted for age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] at baseline). Prognostic factors associated with PSD included baseline medication with antidepressants, higher lesion volume, history of depression and assignment to placebo. While 65% of the effect of thrombolysis on PSD was caused directly, while 35% where mediated by an improvement of the mRS. CONCLUSIONS Treatment with alteplase in patients with acute stroke resulted in lower rates of depression at 90 days, which was only partially explained by reduced functional disability.

This study examined vicarious racism and vigilance in relation to symptoms of depression and anxiety among Asian and Black Americans. METHODS We used data from a cross-sectional study of 604 Asian American and 844 Black American adults aged ≥18 in the United States recruited from 5 US cities from May 21 through July 15, 2020. Multivariable linear regression models examined levels of depression and anxiety by self-reported vicarious racism and vigilance. RESULTS Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, among both Asian and Black Americans, greater self-reported vicarious racism was associated with more symptoms of depression (Asian: β = 1.92 [95% CI, 0.97-2.87]; Black: β = 1.72 [95% CI, 0.95-2.49]) and anxiety (Asian: β = 2.40 [95% CI, 1.48-3.32]; Black: β = 1.98 [95% CI, 1.17-2.78]). Vigilance was also positively related to symptoms of depression (Asian: β = 1.54 [95% CI, 0.58-2.50]; Black: β = 0.90 [95% CI, 0.12-1.67]) and anxiety (Asian: β = 1.98 [95% CI, 1.05-2.91]; Black: β = 1.64 [95% CI, 0.82-2.45]). CONCLUSIONS Mental health problems are a pressing concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results from our study suggest that heightened racist sentiment, harassment, and violence against Asian and Black Americans contribute to increased risk of depression and anxiety via vicarious racism and vigilance.

HFNC provides higher concentration and flow of oxygen, resulting in decreasing anatomic dead space by preventing rebreathing and ensure positive end-expiratory. However, in COVID-19, the usage of HFNC is much controversial due to concerns about the benefits and risk of aerosol-dispersion. Considering the debates about the use of HFNC, we reviewed the literature related to the usage of HFNC in COVID-19. The available reports suggest that HFNC provides high concentrations of oxygen to the patients, who can not reach with conventional devices. HFNC can reduce the requiring of intubation in patients with COVID-19, and it can decrease the length of intensive care unit stay, and complications related to mechanical ventilation. Also HFNC can in achieving apneic oxygenation in patients during airway management. Besides that, the use of high-flow oxygen cannulas can produce aerosols.

METHODS This study was conducted from January 2009 through March 2014 at Harran University Hospital and was a chart review of all patients who underwent caesarean hysterectomy with the placenta left in situ for placenta praevia percreta. RESULTS The study group comprised 58 patients. All of the patients underwent ultrasound mapping of the placental area before surgery. Emergent caesarean hysterectomy was only performed in 9 patients; 49 patients underwent planned caesarean hysterectomy. Bilateral internal iliac artery ligation was performed in all cases. Four patients (6.9 %) had bladder damage, one patient (1.7 %) required cystotomy, and one patient (1.7 %) required re-operation because of postoperative hemorrhage. The mean operative time was 141.6 (range: 95-355) minutes. Only 17 (29.3 %) patients were administered more than four units of red blood cells. There was no ureteral damage or maternal death. Furthermore, there were no complications in 42 (72.4 %) patients. CONCLUSIONS Caesarean hysterectomy for placenta praevia percreta is associated with increased maternal morbidity.

It causes many changes in hemogram parameters. Low albumin levels are associated with mortality risk in hospitalized patients. The aim of the present study is to reveal the place of neutrophil count to albumin ratio in predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS 144 patients, 65 females and 79 males, were included in the study. Patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 was the non-severe group (n:85), and Group 2 was severe (n:59). Demographic data, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet counts, albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were recorded. Neutrophil count to albumin ratio (NAR) was calculated by dividing the absolute neutrophil counts by the albumin levels. The NAR and levels of the two groups were then compared. RESULTS There were no significant differences in gender and platelet count (201 vs. 211 K/mL) between the groups (p>0,05). Ages (62.0 ± 14.3 vs 68.6 ± 12.2 years), albumin (33.1 vs 29.9 gr/L), CRP (33 vs 113 mg/l), neutrophil count (4 vs 7.24 K/mL), WBC counts (6.70 vs 8.50 K/mL), NAR values (113.5 vs 267.2) and number of Death (5 vs 33) were found to be statistically higher (p <0.001) in Group 2 than in Group 1.

Yet, most studies have explored sexual harassment among female professionals. This study departs from current research practices and investigates the frequency of sexual harassment in male nurses working in the Greek NHS and the reasons for not reporting their experiences. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted using the Sexual Experiences Questionnaire (SEQ) to collect data from 507 male nurses working in Greece's various settings during October and February 2021. The electronic survey was sent to male nurses (n=3,091 registered with the Hellenic Association of Nurses. Survey items were consent form, demographics, three-dimensions of sexual harassment, silencing and negative consequences. Questions were measured using five-point Likert scales, binary scale and multiple-choice questions. ANOVA and T-tests were used to investigate whether specific groups more frequently dealt with sexual harassment. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to investigate the association between independent variables (sexually harassing behaviours) and the dependent variable (participants' negative physical, mental, and job-related outcomes). RESULTS 40% of male nurses have experienced sexual harassment at least once in their working lives, and the most common form of sexual harassment faced was gender harassment, followed by unwanted sexual attention. Male doctors and male nurses were the most common perpetrators. Private and younger male nurses with up to 5 years of experience experienced more frequent sexual harassment. 30% did not report sexual harassment due to the fear that no one would believe them, and because of beliefs, no action would be taken against the wrongdoer. Multiple regression analyses showed that unwanted sexual attention and sexual coercion were associated with physical and job-related outcomes. Cronbach Alpha was 0.91. CONCLUSION A high proportion of male nurses have experienced sexual harassment during their careers. Being younger with limited working experience and working in the private sector were positively associated with sexual harassment.

Surgical staplers are commonly used in a variety of open and minimally invasive abdominal and thoracic procedures. Assessment of wound healing traits, such as perfusion, has been challenging due to technical limitations. A novel technique that utilizes micro-computed tomography methodology to measure perfusion was designed to compare the micro-perfusion of staple lines between commercial stapler reloads that employ different staple height strategies. Materials and methods Following an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocol, rats were euthanized and immediately heparinized prior to a subtotal gastrectomy with either graduated-height or single-height staples. Rats were then perfused with barium, following which stomachs were removed and immediately fixed in formalin to prevent degradation. Stomachs were then imaged using micro-computed tomography and subsequent analysis was utilized to quantify fluid volume and patent vasculature proximity to staples within the staple line region for each group. Results Average perfusion volume was significantly higher with graduated-height staples (0.33% ± 0.18%) compared to single-height staples (0.16% ± 0.09%, P=0.011). Average vessel-to-staple line distance was not significant but trended lower with graduated-height staples (0.35±0.02 mm) compared to single-height staples (0.36±0.03 mm, P=0.18). Discussion Graduated-height staples had significantly higher perfusion volume than single-height staples, which likely has a downstream benefit on wound healing and clinical outcomes. Conclusion This study shows a higher perfusion volume around the staple lines using graduated-height staples as compared to single-height staples and this may contribute to better wound healing in patients.","Eschbach, Matthew; Sindberg, Gregory M; Godek, Marisha L; Nagelschmidt, Matthew; Paquette, Nicholas; Wegener, Michael; Alberino, James; Mayotte, Jane; Vasanji, Amit; Miesse, Andrew M",Medical devices,117,17

RESULTS From 12 849 potentially relevant publications, 82 studies (15 517 457 men and 18 537 599 women) were included. No significant between-sex differences in adherence to AHT were observed, whether all study-specific estimates were summarised (ORs 1.04, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.09, p=0.07), nor estimates were pooled according to the method for measuring adherence. Among patients aged 65 years or older, lower self-reported adherence was observed in women (ORs 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97, p=0.02), while the main result remained unchanged according to other subgroup analyses. CONCLUSIONS Definitive evidence of sex differences in adherence to AHT therapy cannot be drawn. Our little knowledge about factors affecting adherence, in particular of sex effect among elderly, urgently requires high-quality studies investigating these issues.","Biffi, Annalisa; Rea, Federico; Iannaccone, Teresa; Filippelli, Amelia; Mancia, Giuseppe; Corrao, Giovanni",BMJ open,117,1

Pathogenesis of HCV infection is strongly driven by a deficient immune response of the host, although intersection of different aspects of the virus life cycle with cellular homeostasis is emerging as an important player in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease. Cryo soft X-ray tomography (cryo-SXT) was performed to investigate the ultrastructural alterations induced by the interference of HCV replication with cellular homeostasis. Native, whole cell, three-dimensional (3D) maps were obtained in HCV replicon-harboring cells and in a surrogate model of HCV infection. Tomograms from HCV-replicating cells show blind-ended endoplasmic reticulum tubules with pseudospherical extrusions and marked alterations of mitochondrial morphology that correlated spatially with the presence of endoplasmic reticulum alterations, suggesting a short-range influence of the viral machinery on mitochondrial homeostasis. Both mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum alterations could be reverted by a combination of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir, which are clinically approved direct-acting antivirals for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. In addition to providing structural insight into cellular aspects of HCV pathogenesis, our study illustrates how cryo-SXT is a powerful 3D wide-field imaging tool for the assessment and understanding of complex cellular processes in a setting of near-native whole hydrated cells. Our results also constitute a proof of concept for the use of cryo-SXT as a platform that enables determining the potential impact of candidate compounds on the ultrastructure of the cell that may assist drug development at a preclinical level.","Pérez-Berná, Ana Joaquina; Rodríguez, Maria José; Chichón, Francisco Javier; Friesland, Martina Friederike; Sorrentino, Andrea; Carrascosa, Jose L; Pereiro, Eva; Gastaminza, Pablo",ACS nano,117,1

How temperature and biological systems interact to influence aging and lifespan has been investigated using model organisms, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In this review, we discuss mechanisms by which diverse cellular factors modulate the effects of ambient temperatures on aging and lifespan in C. elegans. C. elegans thermosensory neurons alleviate lifespan-shortening effects of high temperatures via sterol endocrine signaling and probably through systemic regulation of cytosolic proteostasis. At low temperatures, C. elegans displays a long lifespan by upregulating the cold-sensing TRPA channel, lipid homeostasis, germline-mediated prostaglandin signaling, and autophagy. In addition, co-chaperone p23 amplifies lifespan changes affected by high and low temperatures. Our review summarizes how external temperatures modulate C. elegans lifespan and provides information regarding responses of biological processes to temperature changes, which may affect health and aging at an organism level.","Kim, Byounghun; Lee, Jongsun; Kim, Younghun; Lee, Seung-Jae V",Journal of neurogenetics,117,31

Instead of sounding an alarm the moment the oxygen saturation reading violates the upper or lower limit settings, a magnitude and duration of tolerance can be set. The primary objective was to study the proportion of nuisance alarms relative to the proportion of clinically relevant alarms being filtered under 4 different SatSeconds alarm settings (ie, 10, 25, 50, and 100) in the neonatal intensive care environment. METHODS This is an observational prospective study of 50 infants cared for in 3 large neonatal ICUs. Infants were monitored for 4 continuous h each by a study observer with the study monitor, in addition to standard multiparameter monitors. The performance of the SatSeconds alarm was compared with nursing intervention. RESULTS The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95% CI) for SatSeconds alarm settings when compared with nursing intervention were as follows: 0.61 (0.57-0.66) when the SatSeconds alarm setting was off, 0.63 (0.59-0.68) for the 10 SatSeconds alarm setting, 0.64 (0.59-0.69) for the 25 SatSeconds alarm setting, 0.64 (0.59-0.69) for the 50 SatSeconds alarm setting, and 0.63 (0.58-0.68) for the 100 SatSeconds alarm setting, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The SatSeconds feature of the OxiMax N-600x pulse oximeter reduced some nuisance alarms; however, its specificity to nurse-identified desaturation events does not significantly improve with lengthening SatSeconds alarm settings.","Stefanescu, Beatrice M; O'Shea, T Michael; Haury, Fran; Carlo, Waldemar A; Slaughter, James C",Respiratory care,117,27

However, we do not yet know whether these microorganisms interact. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between Streptococcus pneumoniae and SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric patients. Methods: This study was conducted retrospectively by means of medical records of pediatric patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 11 and June 04, 2020, in the University of Health Sciences, Ankara Educating and Training Hospital and Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine. Results: We evaluated 829 pediatric patients for S. pneumoniae and SARS-CoV-2 from their nasopharyngeal specimen. Of 115 children positive for SARS-CoV-2, 32.2% had a positive S. pneumoniae test, whereas of 714 children negative for SARS-CoV-2, 14.1% had a positive S. pneumoniae test (p < .01).

OBJECTIVE To compare short-term (30-day) outcomes between laparoscopic (LH) and open (OH) partial hepatectomies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective matched case-control study from April 1, 2004, to March 31, 2013, in a tertiary hepatobiliary referral center. Patients who underwent partial hepatic resection (OH or LH) for benign or malignant disease were matched first by extent of resection, then by pathological diagnosis, and finally by age and sex to the extent possible. EXPOSURE Partial hepatectomy for liver disease. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Thirty-day morbidity and mortality rates. RESULTS After the matching process, we included 104 patients (52 undergoing LH and 52 undergoing OH) in the study. Patients were evenly matched with respect to age, sex, extent of resection, and diagnosis. Cirrhosis was present in 17 patients (33%) in each group. We found no difference in positive margin status (1 patient [2%] for LH vs 2 patients [4%] for OH; P > .99). Although the estimated blood loss differed significantly between groups (237 mL for LH vs 387 mL for OH; P = .049), we found no difference in the rate of perioperative blood transfusion (1 patient [2%] for LH vs 5 [10%] for OH; P = .20). Operative time (219 minutes for LH vs 198 minutes for OH; P = .16), hospital length of stay (5 days for LH vs 6 days for OH; P = .13), and readmission rate (4 patients [8%] for LH vs 5 [10%] for OH; P = .70) were similar in both groups. The rates of major complications (4 patients [8%] for LH vs 4 patients [8%] for OH; P = 10), overall 30-day morbidity (22 patients [42%] for LH vs 19 [37%] for OH; P = .70), and 30-day mortality (1 patient [2%] for LH vs 2 [4%] for OH; P > .99) were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients who undergo LH have similar short-term outcomes when compared with those who undergo OH. Laparoscopic hepatectomy was associated with lower intraoperative blood loss, although the clinical significance of this finding is uncertain given the lack of difference in perioperative transfusion or morbidity rates. In addition, we found no difference in margin status between the 2 groups. Future studies are needed to define which patients derive benefit from LH and to determine oncologic equivalence to OH.","Franken, Cara; Lau, Briana; Putchakayala, Krishna; DiFronzo, L Andrew",JAMA surgery,117,1

METHODS A pragmatic clinical trial was conducted in an intensive care unit from March 2009 to September 2016. Patients on mechanical ventilation > 24 hours who developed acute respiratory failure after scheduled extubation were included and were assigned to noninvasive ventilation or conventional oxygen therapy. The primary objective was to reduce the reintubation rate. The secondary objectives were to improve respiratory parameters and reduce complications, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the intensive care unit stay, the hospital stay, and mortality in the intensive care unit, in the hospital, and 90 days after discharge. Factors correlated with reintubation were also analyzed. RESULTS Of a total of 2,574 patients, 77 were analyzed (38 in the noninvasive ventilation group and 39 in the conventional oxygen therapy group). Noninvasive ventilation reduced the respiratory and cardiac rates more rapidly than conventional oxygen therapy. Reintubation was less common in the noninvasive ventilation group [12 (32%) versus 22 (56%) in the conventional oxygen therapy group, relative risk 0.58 (95%CI 0.34 - 0.97), p = 0.039]. The rest of the parameters did not show significant differences. In the multivariate analysis, noninvasive ventilation protected against reintubation [OR 0.17 (95%CI 0.05 - 0.56), p = 0.004], while liver failure before extubation and the inability to maintain airway patency predisposed patients to reintubation. CONCLUSION The use of noninvasive ventilation in patients who failed extubation could be beneficial compared to conventional oxygen therapy.","Belenguer-Muncharaz, Alberto; Mateu-Campos, Maria-Lidón; Vidal-Tegedor, Bárbara; Ferrándiz-Sellés, María-Desamparados; Micó-Gómez, Maria-Luisa; Altaba-Tena, Susana; Arlandis-Tomás, María; Álvaro-Sánchez, Rosa; Rodríguez-Martínez, Enver; Rodríguez-Portillo, Jairo",Revista Brasileira de terapia intensiva,117,29

This paper illustrates how a public health approach was used to influence and inform the development of post-COVID services across two Integrated Care Systems (ICSs). METHODS A literature review was conducted between October and December 2020 to identify prevalence estimates for long COVID. The prevalence estimates were applied to locally available data on the susceptible population to estimate the number of people with long COVID. They were also used to develop a dashboard to predict fluctuations in the number of people experiencing persistent symptoms over time. RESULTS A substantial number of people in each ICS may have experienced persistent symptoms or complications as a result of COVID-19. In Lancashire and South Cumbria, it is estimated that 33 000 people may have experienced post-COVID-19 syndrome since the beginning of the pandemic, which will include respiratory or cardiovascular complications. CONCLUSIONS The findings have been valuable in informing early service developments, engaging with managers and clinicians, and supporting applications for funding at a local level.

It affects 2% to 8% of pregnancies worldwide and causes significant maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Hypertension and proteinuria are the cornerstone of the disease, though systemic organ dysfunction may ensue. The clinical syndrome begins with abnormal placentation with subsequent release of antiangiogenic markers, mediated primarily by soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin (sEng). High levels of sFlt-1 and sEng result in endothelial dysfunction, vasoconstriction, and immune dysregulation, which can negatively impact every maternal organ system and the fetus. This review comprehensively examines the pathogenesis of preeclampsia with a specific focus on the mechanisms underlying the clinical features. Delivery is the only definitive treatment. Low-dose aspirin is recommended for prophylaxis in high-risk populations. Other treatment options are limited.

Nevertheless, the most widely used biologic material - acellular dermal matrix (ADM) - exhibits slow repopulation and remodeling, which prevents integration. Additionally, engineering control of these materials is limited because they require a natural source for their production. In the current report, we demonstrate the feasibility of using genetically engineered animals to create decellularized biologic scaffolds with favorable extracellular matrix (ECM) properties. Specifically, we utilized skin from thrombospondin (TSP)-2 KO mice to derive various decellularized products. Scanning electron microscopy and mechanical testing showed that TSP-2 KO ADM exhibited an altered structure and a reduction in elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength, respectively. When a powdered form of KO ADM was implanted subcutaneously, it was able to promote enhanced vascularization over WT. Additionally, when implanted subcutaneously, intact slabs of KO ADM were populated by higher number of host cells when compared to WT. In vitro studies confirmed the promigratory properties of KO ADM. Specifically, degradation products released by pepsin digestion of KO ADM induced greater cell migration than WT. Moreover, cell-derived ECM from TSP-2 null fibroblasts was more permissive to fibroblast migration. Finally, ADMs were implanted in a diabetic wound model to examine their ability to accelerate wound healing. KO ADM exhibited enhanced remodeling and vascular maturation, indicative of efficient integration. Overall, we demonstrate that genetic manipulation enables engineered ECM-based materials with increased regenerative potential.","Morris, Aaron H; Stamer, Danielle K; Kunkemoeller, Britta; Chang, Julie; Xing, Hao; Kyriakides, Themis R",Biomaterials,117,8

Little is known about the impact on the cardiovascular system, and the incidence and consequences of new onset of atrial fibrillation (AF) in infected patients remain unclear. The aim of this study was to analyze the cardiovascular outcomes of patients with new-onset AF and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS This observational study analyzed a sample of 160 consecutive patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. A group with new-onset AF (n = 12) was compared with a control group (total: n = 148, sinus rhythm: n = 118, previous AF: n = 30). New-onset AF patients were significantly older and hypertensive, as well as presenting more frequently with a history of acute coronary syndrome and renal dysfunction. This group showed a higher incidence of thromboembolic events (41.7% vs. 4.1%; p < 0.001), bleeding (33.3% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.005), a combined endpoint of thrombosis and death (58.3 vs. 19.6%, p = 0.006) and longer hospital stays (16.4 vs. 8.6 days, p < 0.001), with no differences in all-cause mortality.

METHODS Twelve healthy female pigs (weight 30.94 ± 2.49 kg) underwent a transparietal injection of sterile alginate at the level of Z-line (n = 6) and at the pre-pyloric area (n = 6) creating a model of gastric submucosal pseudotumor. The operative procedures included intragastric resection with ML and SI approaches of cardiac and pre-pyloric lesions, with gastroscopic assistance. After resection, the gastric mucosal layer was closed using intracorporeal sutures. The operative time, complication rate and clinical evolution after 1 month were compared in the four groups that the pigs were arranged. RESULTS The pseudotumors ranged in size from 3 to 6 cm in diameter. The access of the gastric cavity and resection of the experimental SMP and suturing of the mucosa were performed successfully in 12 animals using both approaches. Mean time to perform the exeresis of gastric cardia tumors was significantly higher in single-incision approach. No significant differences were observed in the surgical time during pyloric surgery. Minilaparoscopic approach reduced significantly the mucosa closure time in esophagogastric and pyloric pseudotumors. One month after, no alterations were shown in the abdominal cavity using exploratory laparotomy. CONCLUSIONS The technical feasibility of performing safe and efficient intragastric approach of submucosal pseudotumors in swine model was verified in this study. Intragastric ML has advantages over SI, namely regarding the reduction in total surgical times and the fewer technical difficulties.","Sánchez-Margallo, F M; Pérez López, M; Tapia Araya, A; Usón Casaús, J M",Surgical endoscopy,117,20

As an advance to current static assessments, we present a dynamic soil functions assessment (SFA) to evaluate the current and future state of soils regarding their nutrient storage, water regulation, productivity, habitat and carbon sequestration functions for the case-study region in the Lower Austrian Mostviertel. Carbon response functions simulating the development of regional soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks until 2100 are used to couple established indicator-based SFA methodology with two climate and three land use scenarios, i.e. land sparing (LSP), land sharing (LSH), and balanced land use (LBA). Results reveal a dominant impact of land use scenarios on soil functions compared to the impact from climate scenarios and highlight the close link between SOC development and the quality of investigated soil functions, i.e. soil functionality. The soil habitat and soil carbon sequestration functions on investigated agricultural land are positively affected by maintenance of grassland under LSH (20% of the case-study region), where SOC stocks show a steady and continuous increase. By 2100 however, total regional SOC stocks are higher under LSP compared to LSH or LBA, due to extensive afforestation. The presented approach may improve integrative decision-making in land use planning processes. It bridges superordinate goals of sustainable development, such as climate change mitigation, with land use actions taken at local or regional scales. The dynamic SFA broadens the debate on LSH and LSP and can reduce trade-offs between soil functions through land use planning processes.","Jost, Elisabeth; Schönhart, Martin; Skalský, Rastislav; Balkovič, Juraj; Schmid, Erwin; Mitter, Hermine",Journal of environmental management,117,1

We aimed to investigate long-term outcomes of participants of the Step-up/Top-down-trial. Methods Trial participants' medical records were reviewed retrospectively. For 16 semesters following the 2-year trial, we recorded: clinical activity, medication use, flares, hospitalization, surgery and fistulas. Colonoscopy reports were scored as: endoscopic remission, aphthous/small ulcers or large ulcers. The primary endpoint was the proportion of semesters in remission. Results Data were available from 119/133 patients [step-up n = 60]. During a median follow-up of 8 years, clinical remission rates were similar (70% vs 73% [p = 0.85] in step-up and top-down patients, respectively). A shorter time to flare was observed in step-up patients [median five vs nine semesters, p = 0.01]. Cumulatively, 62% of step-up patients used corticosteroids compared to 41% of top-down patients [p = 0.02]. Anti-tumour necrosis factor [anti-TNF] use was higher in the step-up group [73% vs 54%, p = 0.04]. No differences were found in to time to CD hospitalization [respectively 13 vs 14 semesters, p = 0.30], new fistula [14 vs 15 semesters, p = 0.20] or CD surgery [14 vs 15 semesters, p = 0.25]. Mucosal healing 2 years after treatment was associated with a reduced anti-TNF use, but not with differences in other long-term outcomes. Endoscopic remission occurred at similar rates between groups. Conclusions Top-down treatment did not result in increased clinical remission during long-term follow-up, compared to step-up treatment. However, lower relapse rates and a reduced use of anti-TNF agents and corticosteroids were observed. No difference was found in rates of endoscopic remission, hospitalization, surgery or new fistulas.","Hoekman, Daniël R; Stibbe, Judith A; Baert, Filip J; Caenepeel, Philip; Vergauwe, Philippe; De Vos, Martine; Hommes, Daniel W; Benninga, Marc A; Vermeire, Severine A; D'Haens, Geert R",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,117,29

The concentrations of PCDD/Fs were in the ranges of 22.7-5280, 67.5-1610, and 68.4-3180 pg/g lipid weight (lw), while levels of dioxin-like PCBs ranged from 4.91 to 1560, 8.08-294, and 28.2-3540 ng/g lw, in common kestrel, eagle owl, and little owl, respectively. The main PCDD/Fs congener was 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, and CB-153 dominated the seven indicator PCBs. PCB levels have shown a decreasing trend in the last decade for the common kestrel, but not for little owl in Beijing, which exhibited higher levels of pollutants and toxic equivalency (TEQ) values than the other two species. Concentrations of PCDD/Fs, dioxin-like PCBs, and indicator PCBs differed between fledgling and adult raptors for certain species. Raptors in this study generally had a higher TEQ than the no-observed-effect level in the literature, indicating significant exposure risks to PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs in raptors, especially in adult little owls.","Zhang, Ya; Zheng, Xiaobo; Wang, Pu; Zhang, Qinghua; Zhang, Zhengwang",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,117,12

Infected patients may develop graft failure and there seems to be an association between CARV infection and development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). This review summarizes the impact of CARV infection after LTx and potential treatment strategies. RECENT FINDINGS Detection rate of CARV depends on diagnostic methods. CARV infections after LTx are reported more frequently probably attributed to improved diagnostic methods, especially nucleic acid testing. Paramyxoviridae and picornaviridae are most frequent. For paramyxoviridae, the association with CLAD is reported in various single-center observational studies. Neuraminidase inhibitors are approved for influenza and can be safely used in flu-infected LTx patients. There is no approved treatment for paramyxoviruses, most centers use ribavirin in the infected LTx recipient. SUMMARY Antivirals against CARV in LTx recipients have not yet demonstrated reduced morbidity in randomized clinical trials. Agents against CARV under development are inhibiting viral attachment and use silencing mechanisms of viral replication. The cohort of lung transplant recipients is a focus of intense research because of the high morbidity of CARV infection and intense surveillance of LTx recipeints.","Gottlieb, Jens",Current opinion in organ transplantation,117,20

However, comparative data on long-term results between these two techniques is scarce in the literature. METHODS This is a retrospective comparative study between MWA and RFA for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using surgical approach. RESULTS The MWA group consisted of 26 patients while the RFA group consisted of 47 case-matched patients. The two groups were comparable, except patients were older and their platelet count was lower in the MWA group. The median follow-up period was 47.5 months in MWA group and 52.9 months in RFA group (p = 0.322). There was no difference in 5-year overall survival (MWA 73.1%, RFA 46.3%, p = 0.082) and 5-year disease free survival (MWA 13.8%, RFA 14.6%, p = 0.736). When a subgroup analysis of tumors ≥ 3.5 cm was performed, there were 16 patients in the MWA group and 21 patients in the RFA group, the 5-year overall and disease-free survival were MWA 75.0%, RFA 28.6% (p = 0.022) and MWA 25.0%, RFA 4.8% (p = 0.207), respectively. CONCLUSION MWA is comparable to RFA for HCC in terms of long-term outcomes. For tumors ≥ 3.5 cm, MWA is associated with a better overall 5-year survival.","Lee, Kit-Fai; Wong, John; Hui, Joyce Wai-Yi; Cheung, Yue-Sun; Chong, Charing Ching-Ning; Fong, Anthony Kong-Wai; Yu, Simon Chun-Ho; Lai, Paul Bo-San",Asian journal of surgery,117,5

Fasting during illness may contribute to low blood glucose and caretakers' feeding practices during childhood illnesses may thus play a role in the development of low or hypo glycaemia. This study aims to describe the caretaker's feeding practices and association of fasting with low or hypo glycaemia in sick children in Malawi. METHODS A mixed method approach was used combining quantitative cross-sectional data for children aged 0-17 years admitted to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH), a tertiary hospital in Malawi, with qualitative focus group discussions conducted with caretakers of young children who were previously referred to QECH from the five health centres around QECH. Logistic regression was used to analyse the quantitative data and thematic content analysis was conducted for qualitative data analysis. RESULTS Data for 5131 children who were admitted through the hospital's Paediatric Accident and Emergency Department (A&E) were analysed whereof 2.1% presented with hypoglycaemia (< 2.5 mmol/l) and 6.6% with low glycaemia (≥2.5mmoll/l - < 5 mmol/l). Fasting for more than eight hours was associated with low glycaemia as well as hypoglycaemia with Adjusted Odds Ratios (AOR) of 2.9 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) of 2.3-3.7) and 4.6, (95% CI 3.0-7.0), respectively. Caretakers demonstrated awareness of the importance of feeding during childhood illness and reported intensified feeding attention to sick children but face feeding challenges when illness becomes severe causing them to seek care at a health facility. CONCLUSION Results suggests that caretakers understand the importance of feeding during illness and make efforts to intensify feeding a sick child but challenges occur when illness is severe leading to fasting. Fasting among children admitted to hospitals may serve as a marker of severe illness and determine those at risk of low and hypoglycaemia.","Ngwalangwa, Fatsani; Chirambo, Chawanangwa Mahebere; Lindsjö, Cecilia; Dube, Queen; Langton, Josephine; Baker, Tim; Hildenwall, Helena",BMC pediatrics,117,1

Transient haematological remission was achieved with intensive plasmapheresis, but cardiac function deteriorated and renal function was not restored. Initiation of eculizumab after 6 months of dialysis significantly improved organ function. At 43 months after presentation, haematological values had normalised and cardiac function had improved. Dialysis was discontinued after 10 months (the longest reported time in a patient with aHUS) and the estimated glomerular filtration rate had recovered to 70 mL/min/1.73 m(2). In conclusion, treatment of aHUS with eculizumab, even after long-term dialysis, can significantly improve renal function. Discontinuation of dialysis and resolution of cardiac function has implications on the potential recovery and treatment choice of such patients. Earlier initiation of eculizumab, however, might have prevented the irreversible renal sclerosis and cardiac dysfunction.","Emirova, Khadizha; Volokhina, Elena; Tolstova, Evgenia; van den Heuvel, Bert",BMJ case reports,117,24

The herb Flos Lonicerae Japonicae (FLJ or Lonicera japonica Thunb.) is used as an anti-inflammatory agent but the chemical quality of FLJ and its medicinal efficacy has not been consistent. Here, we analyzed the transcriptomes and metabolic pathways to evaluate the active medicinal compounds in FLJ and hope that this approach can be used for a variety of medicinal herbs in the future. RESULTS We assess transcriptomic differences between FLJ and L. japonica Thunb. var. chinensis (Watts) (rFLJ), which may explain the variable medicinal effects. We acquired transcriptomic data (over 100 million reads) from the two herbs, using RNA-seq method and the Illumina GAII platform. The transcriptomic profiles contain over 6,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for each of the three flower development stages from FLJ, as well as comparable amount of ESTs from the rFLJ flower bud. To elucidate enzymatic divergence on biosynthetic pathways between the two varieties, we correlated genes and their expression profiles to known metabolic activities involving the relevant active compounds, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and fatty acids. We also analyzed the diversification of genes that process the active compounds to distinguish orthologs and paralogs together with the pathways concerning biosynthesis of phenolic acid and its connections with other related pathways. CONCLUSIONS Our study provides both an initial description of gene expression profiles in flowers of FLJ and its counterfeit rFLJ and the enzyme pool that can be used to evaluate FLJ quality. Detailed molecular-level analyses allow us to decipher the relationship between metabolic pathways involved in processing active medicinal compounds and gene expressions of their processing enzymes. Our evolutionary analysis revealed specific functional divergence of orthologs and paralogs, which lead to variation in gene functions that govern the profile of active compounds.","Yuan, Yuan; Song, Lipu; Li, Minhui; Liu, Guiming; Chu, Yanan; Ma, Luyu; Zhou, Yuanyuan; Wang, Xiao; Gao, Wei; Qin, Shuangshuang; Yu, Jun; Wang, Xumin; Huang, Luqi",BMC genomics,117,19

BACKGROUND Bariatric procedures are among the most common surgical procedures today. There is, however, still a need to identify preoperative and intraoperative risk factors for serious complications. METHODS From the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry database, we identified 26,173 patients undergoing primary laparoscopic gastric bypass operation for morbid obesity between May 1, 2007, and September 30, 2012. Follow-up on day 30 was 95.7%. Preoperative data and data from the operation were analyzed against serious postoperative complications and specific complications. RESULTS The overall risk of serious postoperative complications was 3.4%. Age (adjusted P = 0.028), other additional operation [odds ratio (OR) = 1.50; confidence interval (CI): 1.04-2.18], intraoperative adverse event (OR = 2.63; 1.89-3.66), and conversion to open surgery (OR = 4.12; CI: 2.47-6.89) were all risk factors for serious postoperative complications. Annual hospital volume affected the rate of serious postoperative complications. If the hospital was in a learning curve at the time of the operation, the risk for serious postoperative complications was higher (OR = 1.45; CI: 1.22-1.71). The 90-day mortality rate was 0.04%. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative adverse events and conversion to open surgery are the strongest risk factors for serious complications after laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery. Annual operative volume and total institutional experience are important for the outcome. Patient related factors, in particular age, also increased the risk but to a lesser extent.","Stenberg, Erik; Szabo, Eva; Agren, Göran; Näslund, Erik; Boman, Lars; Bylund, Ami; Hedenbro, Jan; Laurenius, Anna; Lundegårdh, Göran; Lönroth, Hans; Möller, Peter; Sundbom, Magnus; Ottosson, Johan; Näslund, Ingmar",Annals of surgery,117,8

There is limited information on MiP in low transmission regions as Colombia. This study aimed to describe the epidemiology of MiP through active surveillance of infections by microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between May 2016 and January 2017 in five municipalities (Apartadó, Turbo, El Bagre, Quibdó, and Tumaco) in Colombia. Pregnant women self-presenting at health centers for antenatal care visits, seeking medical care for suspected malaria, or delivery, were enrolled. Diagnosis of Plasmodium spp was made in peripheral and placental blood samples by microscopy and PCR. Results A total of 787 pregnant women were enrolled; plasmodial infection was diagnosed by microscopy in 4.2% (95% CI 2.8-5.6; 33/787) or by nPCR in 5.3% (95% CI 3.8-6.9; 42/787) in peripheral blood. Most of the infections were caused by P. falciparum (78.5%), and 46% were afebrile (asymptomatic).

Currently, there is an unmet clinical and research need for non-invasive approaches to monitor lung inflammation through targeting immunoregulatory pathways contributing to ALI pathogenesis. In this study, we evaluated the role of targeted imaging of very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), as a key integrin mediating the adhesion and recruitment of immune cells to inflamed tissues, in quantifying lung inflammation in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI. Methods: ALI was induced by a single intra-tracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (10, 20 or 40 µg per mouse) in C57BL/6J mice. Control mice were intra-tracheally instilled with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. VLA-4 targeted PET/CT was performed 24 hours after intravenous injection of a copper-64 (64Cu) labeled high-affinity peptidomimetic ligand, 64Cu-CB-TE1A1P-PEG4-LLP2A (64Cu-LLP2A), at day 2 after the induction of ALI. Ex vivo biodistribution of 64Cu-LLP2A was determined by γ-counting of harvested organs. The severity of lung inflammation was assessed histologically and by measuring the expression of inflammatory markers in the lung tissue lysates using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Intra-tracheal lipopolysaccharide instillation led to an acute inflammatory response in the lungs, characterized by increased expression of multiple inflammatory markers and infiltration of myeloid cells, along with a significant and specific increase in 64Cu-LLP2A uptake, predominantly in a peribronchial distribution. There was a strong correlation between the lipopolysaccharide dose and 64Cu-LLP2A uptake, as quantified by in vivo PET (R=0.69, P<0.01). Expression levels of both subunits of VLA-4, i.e., integrins α4 and β1, significantly correlated with the expression of multiple inflammatory markers, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β and nitric oxide synthase-2, highlighting the potential of VLA-4 as a surrogate marker of acute lung inflammation. Notably, in vivo 64Cu-LLP2A uptake significantly correlated with the expression of multiple inflammatory markers and VLA-4. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of molecular imaging of VLA-4, as a mechanistically-relevant target in ALI, and the accuracy of VLA-4 targeted PET in quantification of ongoing lung inflammation in a murine model.","Haddad, Joseph; Latoche, Joseph D; Nigam, Shubhanchi; Bellavia, Michael C; Day, Kathryn E; Zhu, Qin; Edwards, Wilson Barry; Anderson, Carolyn J; Tavakoli, Sina","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",117,1

We hypothesized that alcohol consumption and subsequent abstinence would change the gut microbiome in adults admitted to a treatment program. Stool and oral specimens, diet data, gastrointestinal assessment scores, anxiety, depression measures and drinking amounts were collected longitudinally for up to 4 weeks in 22 newly abstinent inpatients with AUD who were dichotomized as less heavy drinkers (LHD, <10 drinks/d) and very heavy drinkers (VHD, 10 or more drinks/d). Next-generation 16 S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to measure the gut and oral microbiome at up to ten time points/subject and LHD and VHD were compared for change in principal components, Shannon diversity index and specific genera. The first three principal components explained 46.7% of the variance in gut microbiome diversity across time and all study subjects, indicating the change in gut microbiome following abstinence. The first time point was an outlier in three-dimensional principal component space versus all other time points. The gut microbiota in LHD and VHD were significantly dissimilar in change from day 1 to day 5 (p = .03) and from day 1 to week 3 (p = .02). The VHD drinking group displayed greater change from baseline. The Shannon diversity index of the gut microbiome changed significantly during abstinence in five participants. In both groups, the Shannon diversity was lower in the oral microbiome than gut. Ten total genera were shared between oral and stool in the AUD participants. These data were compared with healthy controls from the Human Microbiome Project to investigate the concept of a core microbiome. Rapid changes in gut microbiome following abstinence from alcohol suggest resilience of the gut microbiome in AUD and reflects the benefits of refraining from the highest levels of alcohol and potential benefits of abstinence.","Ames, Nancy J; Barb, Jennifer J; Schuebel, Kornel; Mudra, Sarah; Meeks, Brianna K; Tuason, Ralph Thadeus S; Brooks, Alyssa T; Kazmi, Narjis; Yang, Shanna; Ratteree, Kelly; Diazgranados, Nancy; Krumlauf, Michael; Wallen, Gwenyth R; Goldman, David",Gut microbes,117,16

METHODS Fifty consecutive patients with gallstones, including ten patients (20%) with acute cholecystitis, underwent single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) using a homemade single port composed of a segment of corrugated breathing tube and a pair of surgical gloves. The port was inserted into the umbilicus for simultaneous placement of multiple conventional instruments into the abdominal cavity. All patients underwent dome-down LC using traditional instruments with manually angulated shafts; dissection was done using electrocautery or harmonic scalpel. RESULTS All but two procedures were completed uneventfully. Two patients with acute cholecystitis due to dense adhesions in the triangle of Calot necessitated conversion to two- and four-port laparoscopic procedures, respectively. Operative time averaged 73 ± 2 min for chronic cholecystitis and 95 ± 5 min for acute cholecystitis. There were no perioperative port-related or surgical complications, except for two patients who developed wound seroma and recovered after conservative treatment. We found that healing of the umbilical wound left virtually no scar in all patients.

Some volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in surgical smoke are known to be strong carcinogens. We used a prototype of a multi-layered complex filter in an attempt to eliminate VOCs. METHODS From June 2015 to July 2015, 20 patients underwent transperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. Smoke (pre-filter) was collected 20 min after the electrocautery device was first used during the surgery, by the direct collection method, with a 5-L Tedlar® gas-sampling bag. Twenty and 120 min after the filter was applied, smoke (post-filter) was again collected using the same method. The sample was analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrography. The cancer risk and hazard quotient were analyzed based on US Environmental Protection Agency guidelines. RESULTS Twenty patients with a median age of 54.5 (30-80) years were enrolled in the study. Eighteen VOCs were detected using the Japanese indoor air standards mix analysis. The total elimination rate of the VOCs was 86.49 ± 2.83%. The post-filter (120 min) cancer risk (mean ± standard deviation) reduced to a negligible level for benzene, ethylbenzene, and styrene except 1,2-dichloroethane. The post-filter (120 min) hazard quotient for each compound decreased to levels posing a negligible risk for acetone, hexane, benzene, toluene, p-xylene, o-xylene, and styrene. CONCLUSION Strong carcinogens, such as 1,2-dichloroethane, benzene, and ethylbenzene, were eliminated by more than 85% by using this activated carbon fiber filter and the risks from these compounds decreased to an almost negligible level. We suggest using every measure, including these filters, to protect the health of operating room personnel.","Choi, Seock Hwan; Choi, Dong Hee; Kang, Dong Hwa; Ha, Yun-Sok; Lee, Jun Nyung; Kim, Bum Soo; Kim, Hyun Tae; Yoo, Eun Sang; Kwon, Tae Gyun; Chung, Sung Kwang; Kim, Tae-Hwan",Surgical endoscopy,117,16

OBJECTIVE To document romantic, sexual and sexual risk behaviours in a clinical sample of adolescent females with severe obesity (BMI > 40 kg/m2 ) compared to those of healthy weight (HW). METHODS This multi-site study-an ancillary to a prospective longitudinal observational study documenting health in adolescents having WLS-presents pre-operative/baseline data from 108 females undergoing WLS, 68 severely obese seeking lifestyle intervention and 118 of HW. Romantic and sexual risk behaviour and birth control information sources were assessed using the Sexual Activities and Attitudes Questionnaire (SAAQ). RESULTS Severely obese females reported engaging in fewer romantic and sexual behaviours compared to HW. Similar to HW, a subgroup (25%) of severely females were engaging in higher rates of sexual risk behaviours and reported pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A considerable number (28-44%) reported receiving no birth control information from physicians. CONCLUSIONS Discussion topics with the adolescent patient should extend beyond reproductive health needs (e.g. contraception, unintended pregnancies) to include guidance around navigating romantic and sexual health behaviours that are precursors to these outcomes.","Becnel, J N; Zeller, M H; Noll, J G; Sarwer, D B; Reiter-Purtill, J; Michalsky, M; Peugh, J; Biro, F M",Pediatric obesity,117,1

However, the significant health care resources associated with this advanced technology impact immediate widespread use and availability. There are currently limited studies to demonstrate the clinical effectiveness and inform decision-making on the use of MRI in radiotherapy. The objective of this scoping review is to identify and map the existing evidence surrounding the clinical implementation of MRI-guided radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer. It also aims to identify challenges and knowledge gaps in the literature. METHODS We will perform a comprehensive search in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from January 2010 onwards. Grey literature sources will include the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We will include systematic reviews, randomised and non-randomised controlled studies published in English. Literature should examine the use of magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiotherapy in adults with breast cancer, regardless of cancer stage or severity. Two reviewers will independently screen all titles, abstracts and full-text reports. Data will be extracted and summarised using qualitative (e.g. content and thematic analysis) methods and presented in tables. DISCUSSION The results from this review will consolidate the evidence surrounding MRI-guided radiotherapy for breast cancer, contributing to the development and optimisation of patient selection, simulation, planning, treatment delivery, quality assurance and research, to help improve patient outcomes, cancer care and treatment for women with breast cancer.

As We used the COVID-19 Simulator, an interactive online tool that utilizes a validated mathematical model, to simulate the trajectory of COVID-19 at the state level in the U.S. COVID-19 Simulator's forecasts are updated weekly and included in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ensemble model. We employed our model to analyze scenarios where the Delta variant becomes dominant in every state. The combination of high transmissibility of the Delta variant, low vaccination coverage in several regions, and a more relaxed attitude towards social distancing is expected to result in a surge in COVID-19 deaths in at least 40 states. In several states -- including Idaho, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Washington, and West Virginia -- the projected daily deaths in 2021 could exceed the prior peak daily deaths under current social distancing behavior and vaccination rate. The number of COVID-19 deaths across the U.S. could exceed 1600 per day. Between August 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021, there could be additional 157,000 COVID-19 deaths across the U.S. Of note, our model projected approximately 20,700 COVID-19 deaths in Texas, 16,000 in California, 12,400 in Florida, 12,000 in North Carolina, and 9,300 in Georgia during this period. In contrast, the projected number of COVID-19 deaths would remain below 200 in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, and Rhode Island. We project COVID-19 deaths based on the current vaccination rates and social distancing behavior. Our hope is that the findings of this report serve a warning sign and people revert to wearing masks and maintain social distancing to reduce COVID-19 associated deaths in the U.S. Our projections are updated weekly by incorporating vaccination rates and social distancing measures in each state; the latest results can be found at the COVID-19 Simulator website.","Chhatwal, J.; Xiao, Y.; Mueller, P.

Changes in the circulating blood cells are served as prognostic factors of COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate the clinical importance of determining the hematological indices and ratios as diagnostic and/or prognostic markers of COVID-19. Methods: This cross-sectional observational study was performed in the West Erbil Emergency Hospital, Kurdistan region, Erbil-Iraq, between August 10 and November 19, 2020. A total of 204 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. The hematological indices and their derived ratios were determined, C-reactive protein and the outcome events were the primary outcome measures. Results: The mean value of leukocytes is ≥ 10,000 cell/mm3, which characterized by neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia. The percentage of monocyte is significantly higher in patients with hypertension with and without diabetes mellitus compared with other patients. There are no significant differences between patients with and without concomitant diseases in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. The mortality rate was 31.3% (64 out of 204).

Although it is commonly assumed that homeostasis modulates synaptic strength, membrane excitability and firing rates, its role at the neural circuit and network level is unknown. Here, we identify changes in higher-order network properties of freely behaving rodents during prolonged visual deprivation. Strikingly, our data reveal that pairwise functional correlations and their structure are subject to homeostatic regulation. Using a computational model, we demonstrate that the interplay of different plasticity and homeostatic mechanisms can capture the initial drop and delayed recovery of firing rates and correlations observed experimentally. Moreover, our model indicates that synaptic scaling is crucial for the recovery of correlations and network structure, while intrinsic plasticity is essential for the rebound of firing rates, suggesting that synaptic scaling and intrinsic plasticity can serve distinct functions in homeostatically regulating network dynamics.","Wu, Yue; Hengen, Keith B.; Turrigiano, Gina G.; Gjorgjieva, Julijana",bioRxiv,117,13

In a randomized trial we evaluated whether remote symptom monitoring and management utilizing Symptom Care at Home (SCH), would reduce symptom burden, improve quality of life, and decrease unplanned health care use in cancer patients receiving active treatment. Methods: Patients (n = 252) receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy were randomized to the SCH intervention (n = 128) or usual care (UC) (n = 124). Daily, those in the intervention group, utilized the SCH system to report the presence and severity of 9 common symptoms during treatment. For symptoms endorsed, SCH participants received immediate, tailored automated self-management coaching. Symptoms at moderate to severe levels were automatically reported to oncology nurse practitioners who called the SCH patients to improve symptom management based on a decision support dashboard. Participants from both groups were assessed at baseline and monthly for up to 5 months on symptom burden (MDASI), mental health well-being and social isolation (PROMIS;HADS) and Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) (Penedo Covid-19 HRQoL subscale). Unplanned health care use was extracted from the EHR. Descriptive statistics examined equivalency between groups. Mixed effects models with random intercepts were utilized to examine group differences over time with post-hoc analyses to determine specific timepoint differences. Results: Participants did not differ on demographic or baseline measures. On average participants were 61 years of age, predominantly female (61%) and white (93%). A variety of cancers were represented with colon, breast and ovarian most common and 60% had stage 3 or 4 disease. Longitudinal mixed effects models found significant effects for lower symptom burden (p =.018) and better HRQoL (p =.007) for SCH participants versus UC at months 1 and 2 with improvements subsiding over the remaining months. Mental health wellbeing and social isolation were not significantly different. There were a total of 71 unplanned health care episodes with 28 for SCH and 43 for UC. Unplanned episode types included: unplanned clinic visit- 3 SCH vs 2 UC;ED visit- 10 SCH vs 16 UC and unplanned hospitalizations-15 SCH vs 25 UC. More SCH participants had no unplanned health care episodes than UC participants (χ2 4.08;p =.04). Conclusions: Remote monitoring and management of patients' cancer and treatmentrelated symptoms during the Covid-19 pandemic reduced symptom burden and improved quality of life during the first two months of monitoring. Unplanned health care utilization trended lower for those remotely monitored. Extending care to the home during the pandemic can decrease demand on the health care system and improve cancer patients' symptom experience.","Mooney, K.; Iacob, E.; Wilson, C.

In this study an evaluation of the awareness of rare diseases, alongside related information and educational resources available for patients, their families and healthcare professionals, was conducted in 2018-2019 using an online survey and semi-structured interviews with rare disease collaborative groups (charities, voluntary and community groups) active across Northern Ireland (NI). Results Ninety-nine participants engaged with the survey with 31 respondents providing detailed answers. Resources such as information, communication, registries, online services, training and improvements to support services were queried. Excellent communication is an important factor in delivering good rare disease support. Training for health professionals was also highlighted as an essential element of improving support for those with a rare disease to ensure they approach people with these unique and challenging diseases in an appropriate way. Carers were mentioned several times throughout the study; it is often felt they are overlooked in rare disease research and more support should be in place for them. Current care/support for those with a rare disease was highlighted as inadequate. Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with rare disease collaborative groups. Reoccurring themes included a need for more effective: information and communication, training for health professionals, online presence, support for carers, and involvement in research. Conclusions All rare disease collaborative groups agreed that current services for people living and working with a rare disease are not adequate. An important finding to consider in future research within the rare disease field is the inclusion of carers perceptions and experiences in studies. Due to the unique role a carer has in the life of a person with a rare disease it is vital that their voice is heard and their needs are listened to. This research provides insight into the support available for rare diseases across Northern Ireland, highlights unmet needs in service provision, and suggests approaches to improve rare disease support prioritising improved information and communication provision, improved access to services, and tailored support for carers of people with a rare disease.

We showed that it is possible to probe the secondary structure of P. falciparum RNA molecules in vivo using two different chemical probes, and obtained structures for more than half of all transcripts in the transcriptome. These showed greater stability (lower free energy) than the same structures modelled in silico, and structural features appeared to influence translation efficiency and RNA decay. Finally, we compared the P. falciparum RNA structurome with the predicted RNA structurome of an A/T-balanced species, P. knowlesi, finding a bias towards lower overall transcript stability and more hairpins and multi-stem loops in P. falciparum.

This method uses reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the spike gene to obtain RFLP patterns that correlate with serotype. Using that test at the Poultry Diagnostic and Research Center (PDRC, University of Georgia, Athens, GA), we have identified a total of 1523 IBV isolates in the past 11 yr. The data were obtained from clinical samples submitted to our laboratory from birds with clinical signs characteristic of IBV infection. The samples are primarily from the southeastern United States but are also from many other states as well as from outside the United States. Most of the isolations occurred during July, followed by May, April, November, October, and January. The fewest number of isolates identified on an annual basis was 20 in 2003. An unusually high number of isolations occurred in 1997 (318 isolations) and 1999 (246 isolations), which coincided with the GAV variant virus and GA98 variant virus outbreaks respectively. By far, the Ark-DPI strain was the most frequently identified type of IBV and ranged from 23% to 65% of total isolations per year. Ark-like isolates, defined as having a similar but unique RFLP pattern from the Ark-DPI vaccine strain were identified every year of the study except in 1996. In addition, new Ark-like isolates continued to emerge each year (except in the year 2000) beginning in 1997, reflecting the ability of that IBV type to undergo genetic drift. Eighty-two different variant viruses were identified although only two (GAV and GA98) became persistent and caused widespread disease. Some viruses tended to be geographically restricted to a given area (CAV in California and MX97-8147 in Mexico), whereas others were widespread (Ark-DPI, Conn, DE072, and Mass). The Florida, Gray, Holte, Iowa, and JMK types were not detected during the 11-yr period, and no foreign virus types were detected in the United States. These data show that IBV variant viruses are consistently circulating in commercial poultry and are capable of causing disease outbreaks. Our observations highlight the importance of constantly monitoring IBV as well as other coronaviruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus that have the ability to change and emerge to cause disease in a susceptible host.","Jackwood, Mark W; Hilt, Deborah A; Lee, Chang-won; Kwon, Hyuk Moo; Callison, Scott A; Moore, Kristi M; Moscoso, Hugo; Sellers, Holly; Thayer, Stephan",Avian diseases,117,28

The first known case was reported in 2002, later coined as SARS-CoV. Over the last two decades, the CoV has periodically emerged in the general population, causing a varying degree of pneumonia. The most recent outbreak, now known as coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), has been on an exponential rise. Similar to its predecessors, COVID-19 causes a fatal form of pneumonia; however, in a small percentage of patients, COVID-19 has shown to cause neurological symptoms. Given that SARS-CoV and the new CoV strain share similar viral structures, COVID-19 may have the capability to invade the neurological system. We present a series of patients with COVID-19, the first of which presented with a seizure, whereas our second patient developed seizures during their hospital course. Neither patient had a previous history of epilepsy. Relevance for patients COVID-19 has rapidly evolved since it was first reported and has proven to be a fatal infective process. The last several months have been challenging for the medical community as we try to understand the complexities of this virus. Clinicians have attempted to assess the most common presenting symptoms based on reported cases. The purpose of this study was to help understand how COVID-19 presents itself when the neurological system is involved. This case series describes the common and uncommon neurological manifestations of COVID-19. By doing so, we hope to provide clinicians with additional information to help diagnose COVID-19 in this unprecedented time and to also be wary of the uncommon presenting features.","Karambelkar, Pranav V; Rojulpote, Chaitanya S; Saeed, Faryal; Pichiarello, Christina; Patel, Nikul; Sharma, Amit",Journal of clinical and translational research,117,8

Chinese drugs for clearing-up heat, dispelling dampness, detoxication, removing stasis, supplementing Qi and nourishing Yin were selected according to patients' syndrome and given additionally to all the three ICWM groups. Retrospective analysis for significance test on changes of T-lymphocyte subsets before and after treatment were carried out. RESULTS T-lymphocyte counts, including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, lowered in all patients before treatment, but increased significantly after treated for 3 weeks, the increment in all the low dose steroid treated groups was higher than that in the basic treated groups, and that in ICWM groups was higher than that in non-ICWM groups, respectively. CONCLUSION Glycocorticosteroid and Chinese herbal medicine treatments could promote the recovery of T-lymphocyte profile, rationally use of them is the effective therapeutic method.","Jiang, Yu-yong; Wnag, Rong-bing; Liu, Jun-min",Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi = Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine,117,5

Replication of the approximately 30-kb positive-strand RNA genome of coronaviruses and discontinuous synthesis of an extensive set of subgenome-length RNAs (transcription) are mediated by the replicase-transcriptase, a barely characterized protein complex that comprises several cellular proteins and up to 16 viral subunits. The coronavirus replicase-transcriptase was recently predicted to contain RNA-processing enzymes that are extremely rare or absent in other RNA viruses. Here, we established and characterized the activity of one of these enzymes, replicative nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU). It is considered a major genetic marker that discriminates nidoviruses (Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae, and Roniviridae) from all other RNA virus families. Bacterially expressed forms of NendoU of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E were revealed to cleave single-stranded and double-stranded RNA in a Mn(2+)-dependent manner. Single-stranded RNA was cleaved less specifically and effectively, suggesting that double-stranded RNA is the biologically relevant NendoU substrate. Double-stranded RNA substrates were cleaved upstream and downstream of uridylates at GUU or GU sequences to produce molecules with 2'-3' cyclic phosphate ends. 2'-O-ribose-methylated RNA substrates proved to be resistant to cleavage by NendoU, indicating a functional link with the 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase located adjacent to NendoU in the coronavirus replicative polyprotein. A mutagenesis study verified potential active-site residues and allowed us to inactivate NendoU in the full-length human coronavirus 229E clone. Substitution of D6408 by Ala was shown to abolish viral RNA synthesis, demonstrating that NendoU has critical functions in viral replication and transcription.","Ivanov, Konstantin A; Hertzig, Tobias; Rozanov, Mikhail; Bayer, Sonja; Thiel, Volker; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Ziebuhr, John",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,117,28

To mitigate this risk for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, a sentinel surveillance system was developed to identify clusters of emerging infections presenting as undiagnosed serious infectious illness (USII) in intensive care units (ICUs). Following a six month pilot period, which had begun in January 2011, the surveillance was operational for a further 18 months spanning the Games. The surveillance system and reported USII cases were reviewed and evaluated after this 18 month operational period including assessment of positive predictive value (PPV), timeliness, acceptability and sensitivity of the system. Surveillance records were used to review reported cases and calculate the PPV and median reporting times of USII surveillance. Sensitivity was assessed through comparison with the pilot period. Participating clinicians completed a five-point Likert scale questionnaire about the acceptability of surveillance. Between 11 July 2011 and 10 January 2013, 34 cases were reported. Of these, 22 remained classified as USII at the time of the evaluation, none of which were still hospitalised. No clusters were identified. The 22 USII cases had no association with the Games, suggesting that they represented the background level of USII in the area covered by the surveillance. This corresponded to an annualised rate of 0.39 cases/100,000 population and a PPV of 65%. Clinicians involved in the surveillance reported high acceptability levels. The USII surveillance model could be a useful public health tool in other countries and during mass gathering events for identifying potential clusters of emerging infections.","Dabrera, G; Said, B; Kirkbride, H",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,117,16

The NH2- and COOH-terminal halves of CHIP are sequence-related, and hydropathy analysis predicted six membrane-spanning domains with five connecting loops (A-E). Here, we determined the membrane topology of CHIP expressed in Xenopus oocytes using biologically active recombinant channels. CHIP is glycosylated at Asn-42, indicating loop A is exofacial. An epitope from the coronavirus E1 glycoprotein was inserted into CHIP and localized to the outer or inner leaflet of the membrane by alpha-chymotrypsin digestion of intact oocytes or inside-out membrane vesicles. The E1 epitope at Thr-120 was protease-sensitive in intact oocytes, indicating that loop C is exofacial. The E1 epitope at Lys-6, Arg-162, or Lys-267 was protease-sensitive in inside-out membrane vesicles, confirming the cytoplasmic location of the NH2 and COOH termini and loop D. Insertions into loops B and E did not produce active water channels, but their cleavage patterns were consistent with inner (loop B) and outer (loop E) leaflet locations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The sample consisted of 30 patients with overdentures, who were selected from the dental records filed at the institution. Data on general health and the dental implants involved (brand, type of prosthetic connection, number of implants, and additional overdenture retention system) were collected from the medical records. The 30 patients were invited to answer the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) and visual analog scale (VAS) questionnaires, and due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, it was possible to contact 15 patients. RESULTS Most of the prostheses studied were mandibular overdentures, and 66.66% of the cases were retained by the O-ring system. As for the oral health self-perception of the individuals, it was concluded that male patients had a lower mean overall score (p = 0.047) and functional domain (p = 0.042) in the OHIP-14. The number of implants and the installation arch interfered with functional domain and psychological capacity (p <0.05). The VAS showed that women have greater esthetic satisfaction with prostheses (p = 0.048) and that the bar-clip retention system is more satisfactory than the O-ring (p = 0.017). CONCLUSION Despite the limitations of overdentures, it was noted that, when properly indicated, they are a viable option for oral rehabilitation on implants.

The population consisted of 64 (32.5%) claudicants (Rutherford categories 2/3) and 133 (67.5%) patients with critical limb ischemia (Rutherford category ≥4). A primary antegrade attempt to cross had been made prior to the tibiopedal attempt in 132 (67.0%) cases. Techniques used for access, retrograde lesion crossing, and treatment were at the operator's discretion. Follow-up data were obtained 30 days after the procedure. RESULTS Technical tibiopedal access success was achieved in 184 (93.4%) of 197 patients and technical occlusion crossing success in 157 (85.3%) of the 184 successful tibial accesses. Failed access attempts were more common in women (9 of 13 failures). The rate of successful crossing was roughly equivalent between sexes [84.7% (50/59) women compared to 85.6% (107/125) men]. Technical success did not differ significantly based on a prior failed antegrade attempt: the access success rate was 92.4% (122/132) after a failed antegrade access vs 95.4% (62/65) in those with a primary tibiopedal attempt (p=0.55). Similarly, crossing success was achieved in 82.8% (101/122) after a failed antegrade access vs 90.3% (56/62) for patients with no prior antegrade attempt (p=0.19). Minor complications related to the access site occurred in 11 (5.6%) cases; no patient had access vessel thrombosis, compartment syndrome, or surgical revascularization.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four patients (10 men, 14 women; mean age, 39 years; age range, 23-70 years) with confirmed SARS underwent follow-up thin-section CT of the thorax. The scans were obtained on average 36.5 days after hospital admission and were analyzed for parenchymal abnormality (ground-glass opacification, consolidation, or interstitial thickening) and evidence of fibrosis (parenchymal band, traction bronchiectasis, irregular interfaces). Patients were assigned to group 1 (with CT evidence of fibrosis) and group 2 (without CT evidence of fibrosis) for analysis. Patient demographics, length of hospital stay, rate of intensive care unit admission, peak lactate dehydrogenase level, pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone therapy, and peak opacification on chest radiographs were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Parenchymal abnormality was found in 96% (23 of 24) of patients and ranged from residual ground-glass opacification and interstitial thickening in group 2 (nine of 24, 38%) to fibrosis in group 1 (15 of 24, 62%). Patients in group 1 were older (mean age, 45 vs 30.3 years), had a higher rate of intensive care unit admission (27% [four of 15] vs 11% [one of nine]), more requirement for pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone (87%, [13 of 15] vs 67% [six of nine]), higher peak lactate dehydrogenase level (438.9 vs 355.6 U/L), and higher peak opacification on chest radiographs (estimated area, 14% vs 11%) than patients in group 2.

There are no effective antiviral drugs for SARS although the epidemic of SARS was controlled. The aim of this study was to develop an RNAi (RNA interference) approach that specifically targeted the N gene sequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) by synthesizing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in vivo, and to assess the inhibitory effect of this shRNA on SARS-CoV N antigen expression. METHODS The eukaryotic expression plasmid pEGFP-C1-N, containing SARS-CoV N gene, was co-transfected into 293 cells with either the RNAi plasmid pshRNA-N or unrelated control plasmid pshRNA-HBV-C4. At 24, 48 and 72 hours post transfection, the green fluorescence was observed through a fluorescence microscope. The RNA levels of SARS-CoV N were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The expression of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and protein N were detected using Western blot. RESULTS The vector, pshRNA-N expressing shRNA which targeted the N gene of SARS-CoV, was successfully constructed. The introduction of RNAi plasmid efficiently and specifically inhibited the synthesis of protein N. RT-PCR showed that RNAs of N gene were clearly reduced when the pEGFP-C1-N was cotransfected with pshRNA-N, whereas the control vector did not exhibit inhibitory effect on N gene transcription. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate that RNAi mediated silencing of SARS-CoV gene could effectively inhibit expression of SARS-CoV antigen, hence RNAi based strategy should be further explored as a more efficacious antiviral therapy of SARS-CoV infection.","Tao, Peng; Zhang, Jun; Tang, Ni; Zhang, Bing-qiang; He, Tong-chuan; Huang, Ai-long",Chinese medical journal,117,13

Comparison with the sequence of Australian gill-associated virus (GAV) indicated that the region, comprising approximately 30% of the YHV genome, commences 268 nt upstream of the putative ORF1a termination codon and continues through ORF1b to a site 30 nt downstream of the ORF2 initiation codon. YHV ORF1a and ORF1b overlap by 37 nt. MFOLD analysis of the overlap and downstream region predicted a 131 nt folding structure (deltaG = -47.3 kcal mol(-1)) with potential to form an RNA pseudoknot. The structure resides 3 nt downstream of a ribosomal frame-shift 'slippery' sequence (AAAUUUU) and a -1 frame-shift at this site would extend the ORF1 polyprotein by 2616 amino acids (299322 Da). In ORF1b, YHV shares 88.9% amino acid sequence identity with GAV and includes conserved polymerase, metal ion binding, helicase and other domains (Motifs 1 and 3) characteristic of nidoviruses. Compared to GAV, the YHV non-coding region linking the ORF 1b and ORF2 genes contains a 263 nt insertion. However, the region contains a conserved core sequence of 46 nucleotides (84.8% identity) that includes a stretch of 20 identical nucleotides surrounding a sub-genomic RNA transcription termination site. The data confirms the taxonomic placement of YHV in the Nidovirales and supports biological and topographical evidence that YHV and GAV may be classified as distinct species.","Sittidilokratna, Nusra; Hodgson, Richard A J; Cowley, Jeff A; Jitrapakdee, Sarawut; Boonsaeng, Vichal; Panyim, Sakol; Walker, Peter J",Diseases of aquatic organisms,117,24

A number of alternate approaches are being pursued to generate cross-protective, dose-sparing, safe, and effective vaccines, as traditional vaccine approaches, i.e., embryonated egg-grown, are not immunogenic. We developed a replication-incompetent adenoviral vector-based, adjuvant- and egg-independent pandemic influenza vaccine strategy as a potential alternative to conventional egg-derived vaccines. In this paper, we address suboptimal dose and longevity of vaccine-induced protective immunity and demonstrate that a vaccine dose as little as 1 x 10(6) plaque-forming unit (PFU) is sufficient to induce protective immune responses against a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. Furthermore, the vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immune responses and protective immunity persisted at least for a year.","Hoelscher, M A; Jayashankar, L; Garg, S; Veguilla, V; Lu, X; Singh, N; Katz, J M; Mittal, S K; Sambhara, S",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,117,1

Our aim was to assess measures taken by sleep centers due to the COVID-19 pandemic and plans surrounding reinstatement of sleep services. METHODS: We distributed an anonymous online survey to healthcare providers in sleep medicine on April 29, 2020. From responders, we identified a subset of unique centers, by region and demographic variables. RESULTS: We obtained 379 individual responses, which represented 297 unique centers. A total of 93.6% of unique centers reported stopping all or nearly all sleep testing of at least one type, without significant differences between adult and pediatric labs, geographic region, or surrounding population density. By contrast, a greater proportion of respondents continued home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) services. A total of 60.3% reduced HSAT volume by at least 90%, compared to 90.4% that reduced in-laboratory testing by at least 90%. Respondents acknowledged that they implemented a wide variety of mitigation strategies. While no respondents reported virtual visits to be &#8805;25% of clinical visits prior to the pandemic, more than half (51.9%) anticipate maintaining &#8805;25% virtual visits after the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Among surveyed sleep centers, the vast majority reported near-cessation of in-laboratory sleep studies, while a smaller proportion reported reductions in HSATs. A large increase in the use of telemedicine was reported, with the majority of respondents expecting the use of telehealth to endure in the future.","Johnson, Karin G; Sullivan, Shannon S; Nti, Afua; Rastegar, Vida; Gurubhagavatula, Indira",J. clin. sleep med,117,24

Articles reporting two studies were recently retracted from prestigious journals for reasons including the (thus far) unverifiable provenance of data. This commentary adopts a health information management lens to focus on aspects of data in one of the studies (investigating the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19). THE ISSUES: Referencing the Australian context, the current article considers some of the study's reported hospital administrative and coded data categories within the context of Australian hospitals' health information management practices. It highlights potential risks associated with the collection and interpretation of 'big' health data. IMPLICATIONS: This article identifies pitfalls that confront researchers undertaking multi-country studies and the need to consider country-specific: (i) collected administrative data items; (ii) health information-related ethical, legal and management policy constraints on the use of confidential hospital records and derived data; and (iii) differences in health classification systems and versions used in the coding of diagnoses and related procedures, interventions and health behaviours.

We aimed to study the symptoms and comorbidities that associate with this pandemic in 3 different regions of Mexico. METHODS: We analyzed data from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients evaluated at healthcare centers and hospitals of Mexico (n = 1607) including Northwest Mexico (Sinaloa state), Southeast Mexico (Veracruz state) and West Mexico (Jalisco state) between March 1 and July 30, 2020. Mexico consists of a total population that exceeds 128 million. Demographics, comorbidities and clinical symptoms were collected. Statistical descriptive analysis and correlation analyses of symptoms, comorbidities and mortality were performed. RESULTS: A total of 1607 hospitalized patients positive for COVID-19 across all 3 regions of Mexico were included. The average age was 54.6 years and 60.4% were male. A mortality rate of 33.1% was observed. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (43.2%), obesity (30.3%) and diabetes (31.4%). Hypertension was more frequent in West (45%), followed by Northwest (37%) and Southeast Mexico (29%). Obesity was around 30% in Northwest and West whereas an 18% was reported in Southeast. Diabetes was most common in West (34%) followed by Northwest (22%) and Southeast (13%). This might be related to the highest mortality rate in Northwest (31%) and West (37%) when compared to Southeast. Most common symptoms in our overall cohort were fever (80.8%), cough (79.8%), headache (66%), dyspnea (71.1%), myalgia (53.8%), joints pain (50.8%) and odynophagia (34.8%). Diarrhea was the main gastrointestinal (GI) symptom (21.3%), followed by abdominal pain (18%), and nausea/ vomiting (4.5%). Diarrhea and abdominal pain were more common in West (23.1 and 21%), followed by Southeast (17.8, and 9.8%) and Northwest (11.4 and 3.1%). CONCLUSION: Our study showed a high mortality rate likely related to high frequencies of comorbidities (hypertension, obesity and diabetes). Mortality was different across regions. These discrepancies might be related to the differences in the frequencies of comorbidities, and partially attributed to differences in socio-economic conditions and quality of care. Thus, our findings stress the need for improved strategies to get better outcomes in our population.","Pizuorno, Antonio; Fierro, Nora A; Copado-Villagrana, Edgar D; Herrera-Solís, María E; Oskrochi, Gholamreza; Brim, Hassan; Ashktorab, Hassan",BMC Infect Dis,117,4

One of the options in the treatment is Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy when there is presence of required amount of neutralizing antibodies in the plasma of recovered COVID patients. Our objective was to analyze the challenges and the constraints encountered in motivation of COVID 19 recovered persons to come for the screening procedures and to convince the selected persons to come for Plasma donation voluntarily. MATERIAL & METHODS: The present retrospective observational study was conducted for a period of five and half months. Out of 1515 number of persons contacted telephonically for Plasma donation, 1291 persons came for screening of whom 1028 persons were eligible for donation, 263 cases were deferred and 966 persons finally donated. RESULTS: Maximum number of acceptance cases were from males-(98.7%). Of the accepted cases, (41.73%) were from the 18-30 years' age group. 33.94% were from blood group 'O' Rh D positive giving maximum contribution from any blood group. 38.3% of the accepted cases had resolution of all COVID symptoms within time period of 28-40 days. Maximum number of accepted individuals (39.75%) had suffered from multiple symptoms followed by 39.02% of asymptomatic persons. Highest number of Plasma donation was contributed by Odisha Government Police personnel (51.56%). DISCUSSION: In this global ongoing pandemic, the ""Fear Factor of contracting the disease"" has acted as a major challenge in motivating and convincing a COVID recovered patient for plasma donation. The challenge before the medical professionals was to motivate, educate and convince the potential donors and the society about the likely benefits of convalescent plasma. This could be finally overcome with the help of positive orientation through social and conventional media as well as mass appeal from government side on the benefits of plasma therapy in saving lives in the present pandemic.","Mahapatra, S; Pati, S",Transfus Clin Biol,117,30

We estimated that the fraction of app-notified individuals subsequently showing symptoms and testing positive (the secondary attack rate, SAR) was 6.0%, comparable to the SAR for manually traced close contacts. We estimated the number of cases averted by the app using two complementary approaches. Modelling based on the notifications and SAR gave 284,000 (108,000-450,000), and statistical comparison of matched neighbouring local authorities gave 594,000 (317,000-914,000). Roughly one case was averted for each case consenting to notification of their contacts. We estimated that for every percentage point increase in app users, the number of cases can be reduced by 0.8% (modelling) or 2.3% (statistical analysis).

Though the WHO recommends chest radiographs (CXRs) for TB screening, the limited availability of CXR interpretation is a barrier. We trained a deep learning system (DLS) to detect active pulmonary TB using CXRs from 9 countries across Africa, Asia, and Europe, and utilized large-scale CXR pretraining, attention pooling, and noisy student semi-supervised learning. Evaluation was on (1) a combined test set spanning China, India, US, and Zambia, and (2) an independent mining population in South Africa. Given WHO targets of 90% sensitivity and 70% specificity, the DLS's operating point was prespecified to favor sensitivity over specificity. On the combined test set, the DLS's ROC curve was above all 9 India-based radiologists, with an AUC of 0.90 (95%CI 0.87-0.92). The DLS's sensitivity (88%) was higher than the India-based radiologists (75% mean sensitivity), p<0.001 for superiority; and its specificity (79%) was non-inferior to the radiologists (84% mean specificity), p=0.004. Similar trends were observed within HIV positive and sputum smear positive sub-groups, and in the South Africa test set. We found that 5 US-based radiologists (where TB isn't endemic) were more sensitive and less specific than the India-based radiologists (where TB is endemic). The DLS also remained non-inferior to the US-based radiologists. In simulations, using the DLS as a prioritization tool for confirmatory testing reduced the cost per positive case detected by 40-80% compared to using confirmatory testing alone. To conclude, our DLS generalized to 5 countries, and merits prospective evaluation to assist cost-effective screening efforts in radiologist-limited settings. Operating point flexibility may permit customization of the DLS to account for site-specific factors such as TB prevalence, demographics, clinical resources, and customary practice patterns.","Kazemzadeh, Sahar; Yu, Jin; Jamshy, Shahar; Pilgrim, Rory; Nabulsi, Zaid; Chen, Christina; Beladia, Neeral; Lau, Charles; McKinney, Scott Mayer; Hughes, Thad; Kiraly, Atilla; Kalidindi, Sreenivasa Raju; Muyoyeta, Monde; Malemela, Jameson; Shih, Ting; Corrado, Greg S.; Peng, Lily; Chou, Katherine; Chen, Po-Hsuan Cameron; Liu, Yun; Eswaran, Krish; Tse, Daniel; Shetty, Shravya; Prabhakara, Shruthi",,117,13

Though imperceptible by the naked eye, the medical, sociological and economical implications caused by this newly discovered virus have been and will continue to be a great impediment to our lives. This health threat has already caused over two million deaths worldwide in the span of a year and its mortality rate is projected to continue rising. In this review, the potential of algae in combating the spread of COVID-19 is investigated since algal compounds have been tested against viruses and algal anti-inflammatory compounds have the potential to treat the severe symptoms of COVID-19. The possible utilization of algae in producing value-added products such as serological test kits, vaccines, and supplements that would either mitigate or hinder the continued health risks caused by the virus is prominent. Many of the characteristics in algae can provide insights on the development of microalgae to fight against SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses and contribute in manufacturing various green and high-value products.","Chia, Wen Yi; Kok, Hanz; Chew, Kit Wayne; Low, Sze Shin; Show, Pau Loke",Bioengineered,117,30

Here, we delineate the intricate relationship between breast cancer and COVID-19. Breast cancer and COVID-19 share involvement of common comorbidities, hormonal signalling pathways, gender differences, rennin-angiotensin system (RAS), angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV). We also shed light on the possible effects of therapeutic modalities of COVID-19 on breast cancer outcomes. Briefly, we conclude that breast cancer patients are more susceptible for COVID-19 in comparison with their normal counterparts. Women are more resistant for the occurrence and severity of COVID-19. Increased expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are being correlated with occurrence and severity of COVID-19, but higher expression of ACE2 and lower expression of TMPRSS2 are prognostic markers for overall and disease free survival in breast cancer. The ACE2 inhibitors and ibuprofen therapies for COVID-19 treatment may aggravate the clinical condition of the breast cancer patients through chemo-resistance and metastasis. Most of the available therapeutic modalities for COVID-19 were also found to exert positive effects on breast cancer outcomes. Besides drugs in clinical trend, TMPRSS2 inhibitors, estrogen supplementation, androgen deprivation and DPP-IV inhibitors may also be used to treat breast cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, drug-drug interactions suggest that some of the drugs used for the treatment of COVID-19 may modulate the drug metabolism of anticancer therapies which may leads to adverse drug reaction events.","Parmar, Hamendra Singh; Nayak, Aakruti; Gavel, Pramod Kumar; Jha, Hemchandra; Bhagwat, Shivani; Sharma, Rajesh",Current cancer drug targets (Online),117,11

Respirator material requirements are reduced by 75% compared to traditional designs and allow repeated cleaning or sterilization. The probability of virus particle inhalation is reduced using novel air filtration pathways, through square-waveform design to increase filter airflow. Air enters the mask from right and left side filters, while the area in front of the mouth is isolated. Clear epoxy is used for a transparent frame, allowing lip-reading, and mask edges contain a silicone seal preventing bypass of the filters. The mask is manufactured using silicone molds, eliminating electricity requirements making it economical and viable in developing countries. Computational fluid dynamics numerical studies and Fluent ANSYS software were used to simulate airflow through the filter to optimize filter air path geometry and validate mask design with realistic human requirements. The breathing cycle was represented as a transient function, and N95 filter specifications were selected as a porous medium. The novel design achieved 1.2 × 10-3 kg s-1, 20% higher than human requirements, with air streamlines velocity indicating local high speed, forcing and trapping virus particles against filter walls through centrifugal forces.","Alenezi, Hussain; Cam, Muhammet Emin; Edirisinghe, Mohan",Biodes Manuf,117,20

In contrast, using a model of opinion dynamics I have been developing for a few decades within the framework of sociophysics, I predicted his victory against all odds. According to the model, the winning paradoxical martingale of 2016, has been Trump capability to activate frozen prejudices in many voters by provoking their real indignation. However, four year later, Trump shocking outings do not shock anymore, they became devitalized, losing their ability to generate major emotional reactions. Does this mean that this time around he will lose the 2020 election to Biden, as nearly all analysts, pundits and commentators still predict? No, because although frozen prejudices will remain frozen, this time the spontaneously activated prejudices are benefiting to both Biden and Trump. The main ones are the fear of the other candidate policy and the personal stand facing a danger. In addition, since Trump presidency having polarized a large part of American voters into narrow-minded anti-Trump and narrow-minded pro-Trump, those I designate in my model as inflexibles, will also drive the dynamics. Both effects, prejudices and inflexibles can either compete or cooperate making their combination within each state, to determine the faith of the state election.

Untreated OUD is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality-notably, overdose, infectious complications of injecting drug use, and profoundly diminished quality of life. Withdrawal management and medication tapers are ineffective and are associated with increased rates of relapse and death. Pharmacotherapy is the evidence based mainstay of OUD treatment, and many studies support its integration into primary care settings. Evidence is strongest for the opioid agonists buprenorphine and methadone, which randomized controlled trials have shown to decrease illicit opioid use and mortality. Discontinuation of opioid agonist therapy is associated with increased rates of relapse and mortality. Less evidence is available for the opioid antagonist extended release naltrexone, with a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showing decreased illicit opioid use but no effect on mortality. Treating OUD in primary care settings is cost effective, improves outcomes for both OUD and other medical comorbidities, and is highly acceptable to patients. Evidence on whether behavioral interventions improve outcomes for patients receiving pharmacotherapy is mixed, with guidelines promoting voluntary engagement in psychosocial supports, including counseling.

The importance of communication during this pandemic has been strongly underlined by public health experts, epidemiologists, media expert, psychologists, sociologists. In the case of serological tests, there are several aspects that have to be considered: why we perform the test, what population is tested, which are the parameters conditioning the results and their interpretation. OBJECTIVES: to show how to quantify the uncertainty related to the validity of the serological test with respect to its predictive value and in particular the positive predictive value. METHODS: the evaluation of a qualitative diagnostic test includes four distinct assessments: accuracy, empirical evidence, practical importance, and prevalence of the pathology. Accuracy is measured by the sensitivity and specificity of the test; empirical evidence is quantified by the likelihood ratio, respectively for a positive and negative test result; the practical importance of the result of a diagnostic test is assessed by the positive or negative predictive value. Prevalence of COVID-19 is substantial uncertainty and it is possible to estimate the apparent prevalence starting from the results obtained with a diagnostic test. RESULTS: at the moment, the knowledge about the accuracy of serological tests is limited and little attention is paid to confidence interval on point estimates. In terms of practical importance of testing at individual level, while negative predictive values are high whatever the level of sensitivity of the test, the interpretation of a positive results is very cumbersome. Positive predictive values above 90% can be reached only by tests with specificity above 99% at the expected prevalence rate of 5%. There is a linear relationship between apparent - testing positive - prevalence and real prevalence. The apparent prevalence in the context of serological test for COVID-19 is always larger than real prevalence. The level of specificity is crucial. CONCLUSIONS: the main applications of the serological test in the epidemic contest are: to study the seroprevalence of the virus antibodies in the general population; to screen the healthcare workers for the early identification of contagious subjects' health care settings and to screen the general population in order to identify new incident cases. In the first two cases, seroprevalence study and screening of a high-risk population, the consequences of the uncertainty associated to the statistics are already accounted for in the first situation, or are overcome by repeating the screening on the healthcare workers, and using the molecular test to verify the presence of the virus in those tested positive. The case of screening of general population is more complex and of major interest for the implication it may have on individual behaviours and on the implementation of public health interventions by the political decision makers. A positive result has, per se, no practical value for individuals since the probability of being really infected by the virus is low. The uncertainty associated with the different estimates (sensitivity, specificity and disease prevalence) play a double role: it is a key factor in defining the informative content of the test result and it might guide the individual actions and the public policy decisions.","Biggeri, Annibale; Forni, Silvia; Braga, Mario",Epidemiol Prev,117,5

In other medical fields, differences in language have been reported for letters written for female and male applicants; however, data on gender differences in LORs for pharmacy residency applications are currently lacking. METHODS: LORs for applicants to our institution's postgraduate year 1 pharmacy residency program for the 2019-2020 academic year were extracted and processed by a natural language processing service. Words within 18 categories were identified and counted for each LOR. Total word count was also compared. RESULTS: Of the 473 LORs included for analysis, 320 (67.7%) were written for female applicants and 153 (32.3%) were written for male applicants. Approximately two-thirds of all writers were women for both female and male applicants. In comparing letters for women and men, there was a statistically significant difference in the percentage of LORs that contained terms in categories described as gendered, solitary/reserved, and desire. There was no statistically significant difference in total word count or in the presence of words in other categories such as grindstone, standout, agentic, or communal. When controlling for grade point average, writer gender, duration that the writer knew the applicant, and the writer's professional position, there were no changes to the statistical findings. CONCLUSION: Letters written for female and male applicants were largely similar with regard to length and word categories utilized. While no clear gender bias was found when evaluating pharmacy residency LORs, writers must continue to assess their implicit biases and how those biases might affect a candidate's application.","Rice, Mikhaila L; Leung, Jonathan G; Mara, Kristin C; Leung, Sarah B",Am J Health Syst Pharm,117,20

Yet, knowledge about the impact of 'music-making' on the well-being of community-dwelling people with dementia is limited. Much of the existing evidence about the benefits of music is focused on care home settings where initiatives can be readily applied as part of a weekly schedule of activities. Therefore, this initiative aimed to provide opportunities to participate in music-making, to increase social interaction and ultimately well-being in a community environment. Ten music-making session were scheduled for community-dwelling people living with dementia and care-partners, once a month between September 2019 and March 2020. Three sessions did not take place due to Covid19. Eighteen participants consented to take part including seven people living with dementia, five care-partners and six former care-partners. Baseline semi-structured interviews explored the lived experience of music and expectations of the upcoming music-making cafes. Self-report questionnaires captured 'in the moment' experiences of each music-making cafe. Follow-up semi-structured interviews explored the impact of music-making on participants' self-reported well-being. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. The findings demonstrate that participating in the music-making café benefitted the self-reported well-being of participants in three ways: first, a sense of camaraderie that enabled the facilitation of connections with others; second, creating opportunities to 'level the playing field' by always assuming a person's strengths and abilities; and third, group participation in music-making meets a need for meaningful musical experiences. We conclude that participating in music-making is a powerful medium to promote well-being for community-dwelling people living with dementia and care-partners.","Smith, Sarah K; Innes, Anthea; Bushell, Sophie",Heal. soc. care community,117,6

These patients had follow-up after an initial in-person evaluation. We designed this retrospective case series to describe the diagnostic categories seen through telehealth, management steps completed during video visits, and to understand whether additional in-person care was required within 90 days of video visits. In addition, we estimated time and cost savings for patients attributed to video visits. RESULTS: Most men seen during video visits had an endocrinologic (29%) or anatomic (21%) cause for their infertility. 73% of video visits involved reviewing results; 30% included counseling regarding assistive reproductive technologies; and 25% of video visits resulted in prescribing hormonally active medications. The two patients (3%) who were seen in clinic after their video visit underwent a varicocelectomy in the interim. No patients required an unplanned in-person visit. From a patient perspective, video visits were estimated to save a median of 97 minutes (IQR 64-250) of travel per visit. Median cost savings per patient- by avoiding travel and taking time off work for a clinic visit-were estimated to range from $149 (half day off) to $252 (full day off). CONCLUSION: Video visits for established male infertility patients were used to manage different causes of infertility while saving patients time and money. Telehealth for established patients did not trigger additional in-person evaluations.","Andino, Juan; Zhu, Alex; Chopra, Zoey; Daignault-Newton, Stephanie; Ellimoottil, Chad; Dupree, James M",Urology,117,16

More recently, the strain of the global COVID-19 pandemic on hospital resources has forced many units to alter the timing of interval surgery and extend the number of neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycles. In order to support this paradigm shift and provide more accurate counseling during these unprecedented times, we investigated the survival outcomes in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer patients with the intent of maximal cytoreduction following neoadjuvant chemotherapy with respect to timing of surgery and degree of cytoreduction. METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients aged 18 years and above with FIGO (2014) stage III/IV epithelial ovarian cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the intention of interval cytoreduction surgery between January 2008 and December 2017 was conducted. Overall and progression-free survival outcomes were analyzed and compared with patients who only received chemotherapy. Outcome measures were correlated with the number of neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycles and amount of residual disease following surgery. RESULTS: Six hundred and seventy-one patients (median age 67 (range 20-91) years) were included in the study with 572 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery and 99 patients with chemotherapy only. There was no difference in the proportion of patients in whom complete cytoreduction was achieved based on number of cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (2-4 cycles: 67.7%, n=337/498); &#8805;5 cycles: 62.2%, n=46/74). Patients undergoing cytoreduction surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy had a median 5-year progression-free and overall survival of 24 and 38 months, respectively. No significant difference in overall survival between surgical groups was observed (interval cytoreduction: 41 months vs delayed cytoreduction: 43 months, p=0.52). Those who achieved complete cytoreduction to R0 (no macroscopic disease) had a significant median overall survival advantage compared with those with any macroscopic residual disease (R0: 49-51 months vs R<1: 22-39 months, p<0.001 vs R&#8805;1: 23-26 months, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Survival outcomes do not appear to be worse for patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy if cytoreduction surgery is delayed beyond three cycles. In advanced epithelial ovarian cancer patients the imperative to achieve complete surgical cytoreduction remains gold standard, irrespective of surgical timing, for best survival benefit.","Yao, Shih-Ern; Tripcony, Lee; Sanday, Karen; Robertson, Jessica; Perrin, Lewis; Chetty, Naven; Land, Russell; Garrett, Andrea; Obermair, Andreas; Nascimento, Marcelo; Tang, Amy; Jagasia, Nisha; Singh, Piksi; Nicklin, Jim",Int J Gynecol Cancer,117,12

DESIGN: Pre-post observational study. SETTING: and Participants: 623 nursing homes in Ontario, Canada, between March 2020 and June 2020. METHODS: We used GPS location data from mobile devices to approximate connectivity between all 623 nursing homes in Ontario during the 7 weeks before (March 1-April 21) and after (April 22-June 13) the policy restricting staff movement was implemented. We constructed a network diagram visualizing connectivity between nursing homes in Ontario and calculated the number of homes that had a connection with another nursing home and the average number of connections per home in each period. We calculated the relative difference in these mobility metrics between the 2 time periods and compared within-home changes using McNemar test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: In the period preceding restrictions, 266 (42.7%) nursing homes had a connection with at least 1 other home, compared with 79 (12.7%) homes during the period after restrictions, a drop of 70.3% (P < .001). Including all homes, the average number of connections in the before period was 3.90 compared to 0.77 in the after period, a drop of 80.3% (P < .001). In both periods, mobility between nursing homes was higher in homes located in larger communities, those with higher bed counts, and those part of a large chain. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Mobility between nursing homes in Ontario fell sharply after an emergency order by the Ontario government limiting long-term care staff to a single home, though some mobility persisted. Reducing this residual mobility should be a focus of efforts to reduce risk within the long-term care sector during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jones, Aaron; Watts, Alexander G; Khan, Salah Uddin; Forsyth, Jack; Brown, Kevin A; Costa, Andrew P; Bogoch, Isaac I; Stall, Nathan M",J.

This review addresses this issue and examines the fate of coronaviruses (CoVs) in water systems, with particular attention to the recently available information on the novel SARS-CoV-2. The methods for the determination of viable virus particles and quantification of CoVs and, in particular, of SARS-CoV-2 in water and wastewater are discussed with particular regard to the methods of concentration and to the emerging methods of detection. The analysis of the environmental stability of CoVs, with particular regard of SARS-CoV-2, and the efficacy of the disinfection methods are extensively reviewed as well. This information provides a broad view of the state-of-the-art for researchers involved in the investigation of CoVs in aquatic systems, and poses the basis for further analyses and discussions on the risk associated to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in water media. The examined data indicates that detection of the virus in wastewater and natural water bodies provides a potentially powerful tool for quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) and for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for the evaluation of the level of circulation of the virus in a population. Assays of the viable virions in water media provide information on the integrity, capability of replication (in suitable host species) and on the potential infectivity. Challenges and critical issues relevant to the detection of coronaviruses in different water matrixes with both direct and surrogate methods as well as in the implementation of epidemiological tools are presented and critically discussed.","Buonerba, Antonio; Corpuz, Mary Vermi Aizza; Ballesteros, Florencio; Choo, Kwang-Ho; Hasan, Shadi W; Korshin, Gregory V; Belgiorno, Vincenzo; Barceló, Damià; Naddeo, Vincenzo",J Hazard Mater,117,1

The purpose of this study was to explore international perspectives of spine providers on the challenges and benefits of telemedicine. METHODS: Responses from 485 members of AO Spine were analyzed, covering provider perceptions of the challenges and benefits of telemedicine. All questions were optional, and blank responses were excluded from analysis. RESULTS: The leading challenges reported by surgeons were decreased ability to perform physical examinations (38.6%), possible increased medicolegal exposure (19.3%), and lack of reimbursement parity compared to traditional visits (15.5%). Fewer than 9.0% of respondents experienced technological issues. On average, respondents agreed that telemedicine increases access to care for rural/long-distance patients, provides societal cost savings, and increases patient convenience. Responses were mixed about whether telemedicine leads to greater patient satisfaction. North Americans experienced the most challenges, but also thought telemedicine carried the most benefits, whereas Africans reported the fewest challenges and benefits. Age did not affect responses. CONCLUSION: Spine surgeons are supportive of the benefits of telemedicine, and only a small minority experienced technical issues. The decreased ability to perform the physical examination was the top challenge and remains a major obstacle to virtual care for spine surgeons around the world, although interestingly, 61.4% of providers did not acknowledge this to be a major challenge. Significant groundwork in optimizing remote physical examination maneuvers and achieving legal and reimbursement clarity is necessary for widespread implementation.","Riew, Grant J; Lovecchio, Francis; Samartzis, Dino; Bernstein, David N; Underwood, Ellen Y; Louie, Philip K; Germscheid, Niccole; An, Howard S; Cheung, Jason Pui Yin; Chutkan, Norman; Mallow, Gary Michael; Neva, Marko H; Phillips, Frank M; Sciubba, Daniel M; El-Sharkawi, Mohammad; Valacco, Marcelo; McCarthy, Michael H; Iyer, Sravisht; Makhni, Melvin C",Eur. spine j,117,16

Therefore, there is a recognized need to identify risk factors for COVID-19 severity and mortality. A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) for studies published before September 29, 2020, was performed. Studies that investigated risk factors for progression and mortality in COVID-19 patients were included. A total 344,431 participants from 34 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Regarding comorbidities, cerebrovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), coronary heart disease (CHD), and malignancy were associated with an increased risk of progression and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Regarding clinical manifestations, sputum production was associated with a dramatically increased risk of progression and mortality. Hemoptysis was a risk factor for death in COVID-19 patients. In laboratory examinations, increased neutrophil count, decreased lymphocyte count, decreased platelet count, increased C-reactive protein (CRP), coinfection with bacteria or fungi, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK), increased N-terminal pronatriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and bilateral pneumonia in CT/X-ray were significantly more frequent in the severe group compared with the non-severe group. Moreover, the proportion of patients with increased CRP and total bilirubin (TBIL) was also significantly higher in the deceased group than in the survival group. CVD, CKD, sputum production, increased neutrophil count, decreased lymphocyte count, decreased platelet count, increased CRP, coinfection with bacteria or fungi, increased ALT and CK, increased NT-proBNP, and bilateral pneumonia in CT/X-ray were associated with an increased risk of progression in COVID-19 patients.

One major cause for failure of NPC chemotherapeutic treatments is reportedly correlated with the elevation of cancer stem cell (CSC) fractions. Thus, this present study aims to investigate the effect of cisplatin (CDDP) treatment on the enrichment of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) and its associated signaling pathway in EBV-negative NPC cells. Cisplatin-pretreated 5-8F NPC cells (5-8F CDDP) were first generated by treating the cells with 0.5 µM cisplatin for 48 h. After the instant treatment, 5-8F CDDP showed increased IC50 values, demonstrating a decrease in CDDP sensitization. Besides, the proportion of NPC cells with cancer stem-like phenotypes comprising side population (SP), key stemness-related gene expressions including SOX2, ALDH1, CD24 was significantly enhanced. Additionally, 5-8F CDDP displayed the upregulation of ß-catenin gene, suggesting its association with the CSC-initiating mechanism. Furthermore, a tankyrase inhibitor for Wnt/ß-catenin pathway, XAV939, substantially reduced CSCs and retrieved the cisplatin sensitivity in 5-8F CDDP. This confirms that the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling is accountable for rising of the CSC population in EBV-negative NPC. Finally, the combined treatment of CDDP and XAV939 exhibited lower 5-8F CDDP cell viability compared to the treatment of CDDP alone, suggesting the reversal of cisplatin sensitization. In conclusion, the enhancement of CSCs in 5-8F NPC cells caused by the instant cisplatin treatment is initially mediated through the upregulation of ß-catenin and activation of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway. As a result, a primary chemotherapeutic treatment with closely monitoring the targeted Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway could potentially prevent the development of CSCs and improve the treatment efficiency in NPC.","Sinnung, Sirorut; Janvilisri, Tavan; Kiatwuthinon, Pichamon",Mol. cell. biochem,117,16

With the ongoing struggle across the globe to combat COVID-19 disease, published literature has described the role of kidney disease in COVID-19 patients based on single/multicenter experiences across the globe. We extracted data from observational studies describing comorbid CKD, AKI and CRRT and outcomes and severity of COVID-19-hospitalized patients from December 1, 2019-August 20, 2020 following PRISMA guidelines. Severity of COVID-19 includes intensive care unit admission, oxygen saturation < 90%, invasive mechanical ventilation utilization, in-hospital admission and mortality. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model to calculate pooled estimates, and forest plots were created. In total, 29 studies with 15,017 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. The overall prevalence of AKI was 11.6% [(430/3693)], comorbid CKD 9.7% [(1342/13,728)] and CRRT 2.58% [(102/3946)] in our meta-analysis. We also found higher odds of comorbid CKD (pooled OR: 1.70; 95%CI: 1.21-2.40; p = 0.002), AKI (8.28; 4.42-15.52; p < 0.00001) and utilization of CRRT (16.90; 9.00-31.74; p < 0.00001) in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Conclusion Our meta-analysis suggests that comorbid CKD, AKI and utilization of CRRT were significantly associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Clinicians should focus on early triaging of COVID-19 patients with comorbid CKD and at risk for AKI to prevent complication and mortality.","Singh, Jagmeet; Malik, Preeti; Patel, Nidhi; Pothuru, Suveenkrishna; Israni, Avantika; Chakinala, Raja Chandra; Hussain, Maryam Rafaqat; Chidharla, Anusha; Patel, Harshil; Patel, Saurabh Kumar; Rabbani, Rizwan; Patel, Urvish; Chugh, Savneek; Kichloo, Asim",Clin. exp. med,117,16

The aim of the study was to analyze hand hygiene behaviors in a national representative sample of Polish adolescents in regions stratified by COVID-19 morbidity, while taking socioeconomic status of the region, as well rural or urban environment, into account as possible interfering factors. The study was conducted Polish Adolescents' COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study population (n = 2323) that was recruited based on a random sampling of schools, while the pair-matching procedure was applied within schools and age, in order to obtain adequate number of boys and girls, representative for the general Polish population (n = 1222). The participants were asked about their handwashing habits while using Handwashing Habits Questionnaire (HHQ) and about applied procedure of washing hands. The results were compared in subgroups that were stratified by region for COVID-19 morbidity, socioeconomic status of the region, and rural/urban environment. In regions of low COVID-19 morbidity, a higher share of adolescents, than in regions of high morbidity, declared washing their hands before meals (p = 0.0196), after meals (p = 0.0041), after preparing meals (p = 0.0297), before using the restroom (p = 0.0068), after using the restroom (p = 0.0014), after combing their hair (p = 0.0298), after handshaking (p = 0.0373), after touching animals (p = 0.0007), after contacting babies (p = 0.0278), after blowing nose (p = 0.0435), after touching sick people (p = 0.0351), and after cleaning home (p = 0.0234). For the assessed steps of the handwashing procedure, in regions of low COVID-19 morbidity, a higher share of adolescents included them to their daily handwashing, than in regions of high morbidity, that was stated for removing watch and bracelets (p = 0.0052), removing rings (p = 0.0318), and drying hands with towel (p = 0.0031). For the comparison in regions stratified by Gross Domestic Product, the differences were only minor and inconsistent. For the comparison in place of residence stratified by number of residents in city, there were some minor differences indicating better hand hygiene behaviors in the case of villages and small towns when compared with medium and large cities (p < 0.05).

Non-emergency endoscopic activity in the UK has been postponed, raising concerns of increased delays in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer and a surge in demand once services resume. Measures to mitigate this risk must be considered. METHOD: This paper reviews various investigative modalities for colorectal disease which could be deployed during cessation of colonoscopy services. We focus on colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) due to its relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic and its ability to triage patients effectively to further endoscopic investigations. RESULTS: CT of the abdomen and pelvis has been suggested as a triage tool while access to colonoscopy is limited. However, CT may lead to the spread of COVID-19 as patients attend the hospital, and it exposes them to the risks of radiation. Faecal immunochemistry tests have been demonstrated as a good predictor of colonic pathology and could be safely used to risk stratify patients when prioritizing colonoscopy. CCE is a safe and innovative technology for investigating the colon. Procedures can be carried out in the community and can be conducted safely during the coronavirus pandemic. It has been shown to be an accurate detector of colonic neoplasia and can reduce demand for colonoscopy. CONCLUSION: As colonoscopy services resume, they will probably experience high demand leading to further delays for patients. CCE could be used to reduce the number of patients requiring colonoscopy and triage those requiring further endoscopic investigations appropriately.","MacLeod, C; Wilson, P; Watson, A J M",Colorectal Dis,117,20

However, the predictors of mortality in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are not yet well understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the risk factors associated with ICU mortality in our hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-centered retrospective study, we enrolled 86 critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU of Dokuz Eylul University Hospital (Izmir, Turkey) between 18 March 2020 and 31 October 2020. Data on demographic information, preexisting comorbidities, treatments, the laboratory findings at ICU admission and clinical outcomes were collected. The chest computerized tomography (CT) of the patients were evaluated specifically for COVID-19 and CT score was calculated. Data of the survivors and nonsurvivors were compared with survival analysis to identify risk factors of mortality in the ICU. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 71.1±14.1 years. The patients were predominantly male. The most common comorbidity in patients was hypertension. ICU mortality was 62.8%. Being over 60 years old, CT score > 15, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score ? 15, having dementia, treatment without favipiravir, base excess in blood gas analysis ? -2.0, WBC > 10000/mm³, D-dimer > 1.6 ug/mL, troponin > 24 ng/L, Na ? 145 mmol/L were considered to link with ICU mortality according to Kaplan-Meier curves (log-rank test, p<0.05). APACHE II score (HR:1.055, 95%CI: 1.021-1.090) and chest CT score (HR:2.411, 95%CI:1.193-4.875) were associated with ICU mortality in the cox proportional-hazard regression model adjusted for age, dementia, favipiravir treatment and troponin. Howewer, no difference was found between survivors and nonsurvivors in terms of intubation timing. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients have a high ICU admission and mortality rate. Studies in the ICU are also crucial in this respect. In our study, we investigated the ICU mortality risk factors of COVID-19 patients. We determined a predictive mortality model consisting of APACHE II score and chest CT score.

Which lessons should be taken from the current pandemic situation? The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterised, and many research teams all over the world are working on prediction of the epidemic scenario, protective measures to populations and sub-populations, therapeutic and vaccination issues, amongst others. Contextually, countries with currently low numbers of Covid-19-infected individuals such as Tunisia are intended to take lessons from those countries which already reached the exponential phase of the infection distribution as well as from those which have the exponential phase behind them and record a minor number of new cases such as China. To this end, in Tunisia, the pandemic wave has started with a significant delay compared with Europe, the main economic partner of the country. In this paper, we do analyse the current pandemic situation in this country by studying the infection evolution and considering potential protective strategies to prevent a pandemic scenario. The model is predictive based on a large number of undetected Covid-19 cases that is particularly true for some country regions such as Sfax. Infection distribution and mortality rate analysis demonstrate a highly heterogeneous picture over the country. Qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis leads to a conclusion that the reliable ""real-time"" monitoring based on the randomised laboratory tests is the optimal predictive strategy to create the most effective evidence-based preventive measures. In contrast, lack of tests may lead to incorrect political decisions causing either unnecessary over-protection of the population that is risky for a long-term economic recession, or under-protection of the population leading to a post-containment pandemic rebound. Recommendations are provided in the context of advanced predictive, preventive and personalised (3P) medical approach.","Chaari, Lotfi; Golubnitschaja, Olga",EPMA J,117,24

Many institutions and health care offices have turned to screening questionnaires to determine the likelihood of COVID-19 positivity. However, screening questionnaires are woefully inadequate as studies have shown that roughly 6.4% to 50% of patients may spread this virus without any symptoms. In this paper, we have outlined a proposal to restart elective procedures after the curve has flattened in a certain locale, particularly for ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs). Until additional data are collected for specific sensitivity and specificity values for PCR testing, we recommend performing two consecutive PCR tests to minimize false negative rates. The algorithm described in this paper can help ASCs begin their practices and provide local public health officials with valuable data that can help establish true sensitivity and specificity rates for these tests.","Naidu, Ramana; Sheth, Samir; Chaturvedi, Rahul; Chakravarthy, Krishnan",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,117,27

The double-scattering system was optimized to deliver a homogeneous dose distribution to a field size as large as possible while keeping the dose rate >100 Gy/s and not exceeding a cyclotron current of 300 nA. We were able to obtain a collimated pencil beam (1.6 × 1.2 cm2 ellipse) at a dose rate of â¼120 Gy/s. This beam was used for dose-response studies of partial abdominal irradiation of mice.

Therefore, antibody titers may be higher in older adults, whose disease is known to have a more severe course than younger ones. This study aimed to compare the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody level in the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive older adults with younger. Patients aged &#8805;18 with positive RT-PCR and checked serum IgG antibodies between November 1, 2020-January 13, 2021 were included. The IgG antibody levels and the time between RT-PCR positivity with the antibody levels were recorded. A total of 1.071 patients were divided into two groups as Group 1 <60 years old (n=902), Group 2 &#8805;60 years old (n=169). The SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titers were higher in Group 2 (p=0.001). This height was present in the first three months after positive RT-PCR.

The COVID-19 pandemic is threatening the gains made in the fight against both diseases. DISCUSSION: Although crucial guidance has been released on how to maintain TB and HIV services during the pandemic, it is acknowledged that what was considered normal service pre-pandemic needs to improve to ensure that we rebuild person-centred, inclusive and quality healthcare services. The threat that the pandemic may reverse gains in the response to TB and HIV may be turned into an opportunity by pivoting to using proven differentiated service delivery approaches and innovative technologies that can be used to maintain care during the pandemic and accelerate improved service delivery in the long term. Models of care should be convenient, supportive and sufficiently differentiated to avoid burdensome clinic visits for medication pick-ups or directly observed treatments. Additionally, the pandemic has highlighted the chronic and short-sighted lack of investment in health systems and the need to prioritize research and development to close the gaps in TB diagnosis, treatment and prevention, especially for children and people with HIV. Most importantly, TB-affected communities and civil society must be supported to lead the planning, implementation and monitoring of TB and HIV services, especially in the time of COVID-19 where services have been disrupted, and to report on legal, policy and gender-related barriers to access experienced by affected people. This will help to ensure that TB services are held accountable by affected communities for delivering equitable access to quality, affordable and non-discriminatory services during and beyond the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Successfully reaching the related targets of ending TB and AIDS as public health threats by 2030 requires rebuilding of stronger, more inclusive health systems by advancing equitable access to quality TB services, including for people with HIV, both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, services must be rights-based, community-led and community-based, to ensure that no one is left behind.","Roberts, Teri; Sahu, Suvanand; Malar, James; Abdullaev, Timur; Vandevelde, Wim; Pillay, Yogan G; Fujiwara, Paula I; Reid, Alasdair; Hader, Shannon; Singh, Satvinder; Kamarulzaman, Adeeba; Ahmedov, Sevim",J Int AIDS Soc,117,1

However, with the gradual easing of lockdown policies in most countries, the majority of non-essential retail businesses are trying their best to bounce back both economically and socially. Nevertheless, the efforts of retail traders are hampered by uncertainty regarding what capacity measures need to be taken, and there is an urgent need to understand how social distancing can be safely followed and implemented in these spaces. This paper draws from retail space allocation, crowd science, operational research and ergonomics/biomechanics to develop a method for identifying the minimum amount of space an individual needs to socially distance in shops, markets, shopping centres and open commercial spaces, when there are other people present. The area required per person is calculated for both static space (where people are seated, standing or queuing, for example) and dynamic space (where people need to walk freely). We propose our method as a step forward in understanding the very practical problem of capacity, which can hopefully allow retail spaces to operate safely, and minimise the risk of virus transmission.","Ntounis, Nikos; Mumford, Christine; Loroño-Leturiondo, Maria; Parker, Cathy; Still, Keith",Saf.

When caring for patients with tracheostomy, speech-language pathologists have significant exposure to mucosal surfaces, secretions, and aerosols that may harbor the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This tutorial provides guidance on practices for safely performing patient evaluation and procedures, thereby reducing risk of infection. Method Data were collated through review of literature, guidelines, and consensus statements relating to COVID-19 and similar high-consequent infections, with a focus on mitigating risk of transmission to health care workers. Particular emphasis was placed on speech-language pathologists, nurses, and other allied health professionals. A multinational interdisciplinary team then analyzed findings, arriving at recommendations through consensus via electronic communications and video conference. Results Reports of transmission of infection to health care workers in the current COVID-19 pandemic and previous outbreaks substantiate the need for safe practices. Many procedures routinely performed by speech-language pathologists have a significant risk of infection due to aerosol generation. COVID-19 testing can inform level of protective equipment, and meticulous hygiene can stem spread of nosocomial infection. Modifications to standard clinical practice in tracheostomy are often required. Personal protective equipment, including either powered air-purifying respirator or N95 mask, gloves, goggles, and gown, are needed when performing aerosol-generating procedures in patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection. Conclusions Speech-language pathologists are often called on to assist in the care of patients with tracheostomy and known or suspected COVID-19 infection. Appropriate care of these patients is predicated on maintaining the health and safety of the health care team. Careful adherence to best practices can significantly reduce risk of infectious transmission.","Zaga, Charissa J; Pandian, Vinciya; Brodsky, Martin B; Wallace, Sarah; Cameron, Tanis S; Chao, Caroline; Orloff, Lisa Ann; Atkins, Naomi E; McGrath, Brendan A; Lazarus, Cathy L; Vogel, Adam P; Brenner, Michael J",Am J Speech Lang Pathol,117,26

This tight monitoring of the invasion of a new virus is a situation that most other invasion scientists could only dream of. Especially spatiotemporal spread data of the early phases of an invasion would be extremely useful in order to understand and predict the human-mediated spread of species around the globe. So far, invasive species that directly affect human health, such as the Sars-Cov-2 virus causing COVID-19, have been treated differently from invasive species affecting environmental health. Despite progresses in constructing large checklists of invasive species, these records often enter the databases only decades after the establishment of the organism in a country. This is inadequate to understand ongoing spread dynamics and estimate current invasion risks. Yet, national services often possess extremely useful information about early detections and interceptions of species at air and maritime ports, which could greatly improve predictions and help set management priorities. Considering the massive impacts of invasive species, it is time to move on to such a collaborative way of handling invasion data. Invasive insects, birds, mammals, fungi, and other species are the result of globalization and call for a globalized response, exactly like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bertelsmeier, Cleo; Ollier, Sébastien",Biol Invasions,117,16

Meanwhile, many suspects are reporting dysfunctions of smell and taste. This study aimed to investigate the percentage of positive COVID-19 who had associated loss of sensation as detected by psychophysical testing. Eight hundred and thirty two suspects were enrolled. At the time of sampling for testing COVID-19 status, olfactory dysfunction (OD) and gustatory dysfunction (GD) tested using odorants like coffee and camphor and solutions of sweet and salty solvants, respectively. The strength of the association between test results of these sensory losses and COVID-19 positivity was assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. The responses in positive and negative individuals presented as age-adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI. Seventy six (9.1%) [95% CI: 7.4%-11.3%] of 832 suspects were tested positive for COVID-19. Paediatric cases of age between 2 and 10 years could not reply appropriately, hence OD in 134 and GD in 118 could not be tested. Anosmia or hyposmia was present in 62 (81.6%) and ageusia in 64 (84.2%) of the total 76 confirmed cases. The OD and GD dysfunctions were significantly higher among confirmed COVID-19 cases compared to negative subjects [Adj OR (95% CI): Smell 3.22 (1.77-5.88); taste 3.05 (1.61-5.76), p < 0.001]. In this study, testing of smell and taste dysfunctions had higher sensitivity in identifying recent-onset loss of sensations in COVID-19 cases. Hence, it may be used as a simple and cost-effective screening test.","Bidkar, Vijay; Mishra, Meena; Selvaraj, Kalaiselvi; Joshi, Prashant; H, Shrikrishna B; Dabhekar, Sandeep; Prathipati, Kiran Kumar; Rathod, Bharat Singh; Shendre, Pooja; Gondode, Prakash",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,117,33

This study examined patterns of self-reported health service utilization, their socio-demographic determinants and association with avoidable deaths during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted between March 22 and April 1, 2020, during the peak rise in confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong. Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong residents over 18-years-old were recruited using a computerised random digital dialling (RDD) system. The RDD method used stratified random sampling to ensure a representative sample of the target population by age, gender, and residential district. A structured self-reported questionnaire was used. RESULTS: Out of 1738 placed calls, 765 subjects responded to the questionnaire (44.0% response rate). The factors associated with avoiding medical consultation included being female (37.2% vs. 22.5%, P<.001), married (32.8% vs. 27%, P=.044), completing tertiary education (35.3% vs. 27.7% (secondary) vs. 14.8% (primary), P=.005), and those who reported a ""large/very large"" impact of COVID-19 on their mental health (36.1% vs 30.5% (neutral) vs. 19.7% (very small/small), P=.047) using logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: Married females with both higher educational attainment and concern about COVID-19 were associated with avoiding healthcare services. Timely public communication to encourage and promote early health seeking treatment even during extreme events such as pandemics are needed.","Hung, Kevin Kc; Walline, Joseph H; Chan, Emily Ying Yang; Huang, Zhe; Lo, Eugene Siu Kai; Yeoh, Eng Kiong; Graham, Colin A",Int. j. health policy manag,117,1

METHODS: An online well-structured and validated faculty self-perceived competency questionnaire was used to collect responses from medical faculty. The questionnaire consisted of four purposely build sections on competence in student engagement, instructional strategy, technical communication and time management. The responses were recorded using a Likert ordinal scale (1-9). The Questionnaire was uploaded at www.surveys.google.com and the link was distributed through social media outlets and e-mails. Descriptive statistics and Independent paired t-test were used for analysis and comparison of quantitative and qualitative variables. A p-value of &#8804;0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 738 responses were assessed. Nearly 54% (397) participants had less than 5 years of teaching experience, 24.7% (182) had 6-10 years and 11.7% (86) had 11-15 years teaching expertise. 75.6% (558) respondents have delivered online lectures during the pandemic. Asynchronous methods were used by 61% (450) and synchronous by 39% (288) of participants. Moreover, 22.4% (165) participants revealed that their online lectures were evaluated by a structured feedback from experts, while 38.3% participants chose that their lectures were not evaluated. A significant difference (pâ<â0.01) was found between FSPC scores and online teaching evaluation by experts. The mean score of FSPC scale was 5.62±1.15. The mean score for student's engagement, instructional strategies, technical communication and time management were of 5.18±1.60, 5.67±1.61, 5.49±1.71 and 6.12±1.67 respectively.

328714,328714,328714,The Lancet Public Health Commission on gambling,20.236778,0.66511774,2021,"ABSTRACT: The World Health Organization (WHO) classified the spread of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) as a global pandemic in March. Scholars predict that the pandemic will continue into the coming winter and will become a seasonal epidemic in the following year. Therefore, the identification of effective control measures becomes extremely important. Although many reports have been published since the COVID-19 outbreak, no studies have identified the relative effectiveness of a combination of control measures implemented in Wuhan and other areas in China. To this end, a retrospective analysis by the collection and modeling of an unprecedented number of epidemiology records in China of the early stage of the outbreaks can be valuable.In this study, we developed a new dynamic model to describe the spread of COVID-19 and to quantify the effectiveness of control measures. The transmission rate, daily close contacts, and the average time from onset to isolation were identified as crucial factors in viral spreading. Moreover, the capacity of a local health-care system is identified as a threshold to control an outbreak in its early stage. We took these factors as controlling parameters in our model. The parameters are estimated based on epidemiological reports from national and local Center for Disease Control (CDCs).A retrospective simulation showed the effectiveness of combinations of 4 major control measures implemented in Wuhan: hospital isolation, social distancing, self-protection by wearing masks, and extensive medical testing. Further analysis indicated critical intervention conditions and times required to control an outbreak in the early stage. Our simulations showed that South Korea has kept the spread of COVID-19 at a low level through extensive medical testing. Furthermore, a predictive simulation for Italy indicated that Italy would contain the outbreak in late May under strict social distancing.In our general analysis, no single measure could contain a COVID-19 outbreak once a health-care system is overloaded. Extensive medical testing could keep viral spreading at a low level. Wearing masks functions as favorably as social distancing but with much lower socioeconomic costs.","Yang, Shuhang; Liu, Yu; Chen, Ke; Li, Tong; Huang, Yi; Chen, Xiaolei; Qi, Pengfang; Xu, Yazhi; Yu, Feifei; Yang, Yuling; Chen, Youhua",Medicine (Baltimore),117,20

There is accumulating evidence that this pandemic has had a large direct effect on these patients and is likely to produce indirect effects through delays in care, psychological strain, and increased alcohol use. Now a year into the pandemic, it is important that clinicians fully understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with ALD and AUD. To fill existing gaps in knowledge, the scientific community must set research priorities for patients with ALD regarding their risk of COVID-19, prevention/treatment of COVID-19, changes in alcohol use during the pandemic, best use of AUD treatments in the COVID-19 era, and downstream effects of this pandemic on ALD.

Understanding the context in which transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), occurs in schools is critical to improving the safety of in-person learning. During December 1, 2020-January 22, 2021, Cobb and Douglas Public Health (CDPH), the Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH), and CDC investigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission in eight public elementary schools in a single school district. COVID-19 cases* among educators and students were either self-reported or identified by local public health officials. Close contacts (contacts) of persons with a COVID-19 case received testing. Among contacts who received positive test results, public health investigators assessed epidemiologic links, probable transmission directionality, and the likelihood of in-school transmission.§ Nine clusters of three or more epidemiologically linked COVID-19 cases were identified involving 13 educators and 32 students at six of the eight elementary schools. Two clusters involved probable educator-to-educator transmission that was followed by educator-to-student transmission and resulted in approximately one half (15 of 31) of school-associated cases. Sixty-nine household members of persons with school-associated cases were tested, and 18 (26%) received positive results. All nine transmission clusters involved less than ideal physical distancing, and five involved inadequate mask use by students. Educators were central to in-school transmission networks. Multifaceted mitigation measures in schools, including promotion of COVID-19 precautions outside of school, minimizing in-person adult interactions at school, and ensuring universal and correct mask use and physical distancing among educators and students when in-person interaction is unavoidable, are important in preventing in-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Although not required for reopening schools, COVID-19 vaccination should be considered as an additional mitigation measure to be added when available.","Gold, Jeremy A W; Gettings, Jenna R; Kimball, Anne; Franklin, Rachel; Rivera, Grant; Morris, Elana; Scott, Colleen; Marcet, Paula L; Hast, Marisa; Swanson, Megan; McCloud, Jazmyn; Mehari, Lemlem; Thomas, Ebony S; Kirking, Hannah L; Tate, Jacqueline E; Memark, Janet; Drenzek, Cherie; Vallabhaneni, Snigdha",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,117,1

Patients with diabetes are more vulnerable to the disease, and the mortality is higher than in those without diabetes. We reported a severe COVID-19 patient with diabetes and shared our experience with blood glucose management. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 64-year-old female diabetes patient was admitted to the intensive care unit due to productive coughing for 8 days without any obvious cause. The results of blood gas analysis indicated that the partial pressure of oxygen was 84 mm Hg with oxygen 8âL/min, and the oxygenation index was less than 200 mm Hg. In addition, postprandial blood glucose levels were abnormal (29.9âmmol/L). DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 (severe type) and type 2 diabetes. INTERVENTIONS: Comprehensive interventions including establishing a multidisciplinary team, closely monitoring her blood glucose level, an individualized diabetes diet, early activities, psychological care, etc, were performed to control blood glucose while actively treating COVID-19 infection. OUTCOMES: After the comprehensive measures, the patient's blood glucose level gradually became stable, and the patient was discharged after 20 days of hospitalization. LESSONS: This case indicated that the comprehensive measures performed by a multidisciplinary team achieved good treatment effects on a COVID-19 patient with diabetes. Targeted treatment and nursing methods should be performed based on patients' actual situations in clinical practice.","Hu, Rujun; Gao, Huiming; Huang, Di; Jiang, Deyu; Chen, Fang; Fu, Bao; Yuan, Xiaoli; Li, Jin; Jiang, Zhixia",Medicine (Baltimore),117,26

Consistent with this, a number of studies have shown that patients with severe COVID-19 have highly elevated plasma levels of von Willebrand Factor (VWF) that may contribute to the prothrombotic phenotype. In the current study, we investigated the extent of endothelial activation in patients receiving hemodialysis who had either mild or severe COVID-19. Methods Plasma VWF, ADAMTS-13, angiopoietin-2 (Ang2), and syndecan-1 levels were determined by ELISA. The sialic acid content of VWF was investigated using a modified ELISA to measure elderberry bark lectin, specific for sialic acid residues, binding to VWF. Results Patients receiving hemodialysis with severe COVID-19 had significantly higher plasma levels of VWF and lower ADAMTS-13. VWF levels peaked and were sustained during the first 10 days after positive confirmation of infection. While Ang2 trended toward being higher in severely ill patients, this did not reach significance;however, severely ill patients had significantly higher soluble syndecan-1 levels, with high levels related to risk of death. Finally, higher VWF levels in severely ill patients were correlated with lower VWF sialic acid content. Conclusions Severe COVID-19 in patients undergoing hemodialysis is associated with both acute and sustained activation of the endothelium, leading to alteration of the VWF/ADAMTS-13 axis. Lower VWF sialic acid content represents altered VWF processing and further confirms the disturbance caused to the endothelium in COVID-19.","Mobayen, Golzar Dhutia Amrita Clarke Candice Prendecki Maria McAdoo Stephen Keniyopoullos Renos Malik Talat Laffan Michael Willicombe Michelle McKinnon Thomas",Research and Practice in Thrombosis and Haemostasis,117,2

In this context, the entire health care workforce must be properly trained to guarantee an effective response. Just-in-time training has been an efficient solution for rapidly equipping health care workers with new knowledge, skills, and attitudes during emergencies; thus, it could also be an effective training technique in the context of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the unexpected magnitude of this health crisis, the health care workforce must be trained in two areas: (1) basic infection prevention and control, including public health skills that are the core of population-based health management and (2) disaster medicine principles, such as surge capacity, allocation of scarce resources, triage, and the ethical dilemmas of rationing medical care. This perspective reports how just-in-time training concepts and methods were applied in a tertiary referral hospital in March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Italy, one of the hardest hit places in the world.The COVID-19 just-in-time training was designed to provide hospital staff with the competencies they need to work proficiently and safely inside the hospital, including an understanding of the working principles and standard operating procedures in place and the correct use of personal protective equipment. Moreover, this training was intended to address the basic principles of disaster medicine applied to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such training was essential in enabling staff to rapidly attain competencies that most of them lacked because disaster medicine and global health are not included in the curricula of Italian medical and nursing schools. Although a formal evaluation was not performed, this is a useful example of how to create just-in-time training in a large hospital during a crisis of an unprecedented scale.","Ragazzoni, Luca; Barco, Ambra; Echeverri, Lina; Conti, Andrea; Linty, Monica; Caviglia, Marta; Merlo, Federico; Martini, Daniela; Pirisi, Alessandro; Weinstein, Eric; Barone-Adesi, Francesco; Della Corte, Francesco",Acad. med,117,1

In this context, an environmentally friendly and cost-effective method has been developed for the biomimetic synthesis of Ag nanospheres (Ag NSs) using aqueous extract of Piper nigrum for the detection of chlorite (ClO2-) and mercury (Hg2+) ions. The strong antioxidant properties of the biomolecules present in the Piper nigrum extract reduce silver ions (Ag+) to Ag0. After optimization of the formulation parameters, it was observed that 1 mL of piper nigrum extract was sufficient to reduce and stabilize 100 mL of 1.5 mM of Ag+ in 2.5 h at 30 °C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Ag NSs revealed their crystalline nature and the characteristic Bragg's diffraction peaks confirmed their face cubic crystal (FCC) lattice. The characteristic reddish-brown color and absorption surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band at 435 nm confirmed the successful fabrication of Ag NSs. Kinetic analysis revealed a three-phase growth pattern involving nucleation, growth and stabilization. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) micrograms, showed spherical NSs with narrow polydispersity with particle size ranging from 10 to 30 nm. The synthesized NSs were exposed to various metal ions and anions. The absorption intensity of Ag NSs quenched in the presence of mercury ions (Hg2+) among the cations and Chlorite ions (ClO2-) among the anions. The limit of detection (LOD) of 7.47 µM and 1.11 µM was evaluated from the calibration curve for Hg2+ and ClO2-, respectively. Based on these promising results, it is suggested that the method reported is a low-cost and one step biogenic protocol for the synthesis of Ag NSs and their employment for the detection of Hg2+ and ClO2-ions.","Vashisht, Devika; Sangar, Sugandha; Kaur, Manpreet; Sharma, Ekta; Vashisht, Aseem; Ibhadon, A O; Sharma, Shweta; Mehta, S K; Singh, Kulvinder",Environ Res,117,16

We start with a generic system in complete isolation, assuming it has a classical limit involving coherent states. Then we entangle it with another system of that kind, and subject the pair to a decohering process. We make a number of broadly applicable and physically reasonable assumptions about this setup. First, we assume that the states selected by the decoherence (called pointer states) have the same local symmetries as the isolated systems, in a sense which is made precise. We also assume that the modular Hamiltonians of pointer states scale inversely with Planck's constant, so that the pointer states are highly entangled in the classical limit. Finally, we require the timescale of decoherence to scale in a certain way with Planck's constant, so that decoherence happens very frequently in the classical limit, but not too frequently. Given these assumptions, we demonstrate that the semiclassical evolution of the system is dominated by a certain dynamical generalisation of Uhlmann holonomy. We construct a coherent state path integral for this evolution, showing that the semiclassical fields evolve in a spacetime with one more dimension than the isolated case. The additional dimension is generated by modular flow.","Kirklin, Josh",,117,18

The possible reason could be due to the difference of few amino acids among the peptidases. Since, overall 3-D crystallographic structure of Mpro from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 is quite similar and mapping a subtle structural variation is seemingly impossible. Hence, we have attempted to study a structural comparison of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in apo and inhibitor bound states using protein structure network (PSN) based approach at contacts level. The comparative PSNs analysis of apo Mpros from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 uncovers small but significant local changes occurring near the active site region and distributed throughout the structure. Additionally, we have shown how inhibitor binding perturbs the PSG and the communication pathways in Mpros . Moreover, we have also investigated the network connectivity on the quaternary structure of Mpro and identified critical residue pairs for complex formation using three centrality measurement parameters along with the modularity analysis. Taken together, these results on the comparative PSN provide an insight into conformational changes that may be used as an additional guidance towards specific drug development.","Lata, Surabhi; Akif, Mohd",Proteins,117,23

Our aim was to evaluate the impact of a gamified e-learning module on adequacy of PPE in student paramedics. METHODS: This was a web-based, randomized 1:1, parallel-group, triple-blind controlled trial. Student paramedics from three Swiss schools were invited to participate. They were informed they would be presented with both an e-learning module and an abridged version of the current regional prehospital COVID-19 guidelines, albeit not in which order. After a set of 22 questions designed to assess baseline knowledge, the control group was shown the guidelines before answering a set of 14 post-intervention questions. The e-learning group was shown the gamified e-learning module right after the guidelines, and before answering post-intervention questions. The primary outcome was the difference in the percentage of adequate choices of PPE before and after the intervention. RESULTS: The participation rate was of 71% (98/138). A total of 90 answer sets was analyzed. Adequate choice of PPE increased significantly both in the control (50% [33;83] vs 25% [25;50], P = .013) and in the e-learning group (67% [50;83] vs 25% [25;50], P = .001) following the intervention. Though the median of the difference was higher in the e-learning group, there was no statistically significant superiority over the control (33% [0;58] vs 17% [- 17;42], P = .087). The e-learning module was of greatest benefit in the subgroup of student paramedics who were actively working in an ambulance company (42% [8;58] vs 25% [- 17;42], P = 0.021). There was no significant effect in student paramedics who were not actively working in an ambulance service (0% [- 25;33] vs 17% [- 8;50], P = .584).

There is insufficient data comparing the impact of intubation versus NIV on patient-centered outcomes of these patients. OBJECTIVE: To compare all-cause 30-day mortality for hospitalized COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure who underwent intubation first, intubation after NIV, or NIV only. DESIGN: Retrospective study of patients admitted in March and April of 2020. SETTING: A teaching hospital in Brooklyn, New York City. PARTICIPANTS: Adult COVID-19 confirmed patients who required ventilator support (non-invasive ventilation and/or endotracheal intubation) at discretion of treating physician, were included. EXPOSURES: Patients were categorized into three exposure groups: intubation-first, intubation after NIV, or NIV-only. PRIMARY OUTCOME: 30-day all-cause mortality, a predetermined outcome measured by multivariable logistic regression. Data are presented with medians and interquartile ranges, or percentages with 95% confidence intervals, for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Covariates for the model were age, sex, qSOFA score &#8805; 2, presenting oxygen saturation, vasopressor use, and greater than three comorbidities. A secondary multivariable model compared mortality of all patients that received NIV (intubation after NIV and NIV-only) with the intubation-first group. RESULTS: A total of 222 were enrolled. Overall mortality was 77.5% (95%CI, 72-83%). Mortality for intubation-first group was 82% (95%CI, 73-89%; 75/91), for Intubation after NIV was 84% (95%CI, 70-92%; 37/44), and for NIV-only was 69% (95%CI, 59-78%; 60/87). In multivariable analysis, NIV-only was associated with decreased all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 0.30, 95%CI, 0.13-0.69). No difference in mortality was observed between intubation-first and intubation after NIV. Secondary analysis found all patients who received NIV to have lower mortality than patients who were intubated only (OR: 0.44, 95%CI, 0.21-0.95). CONCLUSIONS & RELEVANCE: Utilization of NIV as the initial intervention in COVID-19 patients requiring ventilatory support is associated with significant survival benefit. For patients intubated after NIV, the mortality rate is not worse than those who undergo intubation as their initial intervention.","Daniel, Pia; Mecklenburg, Max; Massiah, Chanée; Joseph, Michael A; Wilson, Clara; Parmar, Priyanka; Rosengarten, Sabrina; Maini, Rohan; Kim, Julie; Oomen, Alvin; Zehtabchi, Shahriar",Am J Emerg Med,117,16

In SARS-CoV-2 infection, the host immune response is thought to play a key role in the pathophysiological effects of lung damage. Therefore, corticosteroid therapy could modulate inflammation-mediated pulmonary injury and thereby reduce progression to severe respiratory failure and death. The aim of this study was to analyse the safety and clinical efficacy of corticosteroid therapy in older adults with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHOD: We reviewed the clinical records of confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 75 years or older admitted to our hospital over a three months period (March 1, to May 31, 2020). A total of 143 patients were included in the study cohort. From 2 April, 2020, in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on COVID-19, our hospital protocol added corticosteroid for COVID-19 treatment. We compared in-hospital mortality among patients with critical COVID-19 who received corticosteroids therapy and those who did not. RESULTS: 88 patients (61.5%) were treated with corticosteroids, and 55 patients (38.4%) were not. Both groups were similar in baseline characteristics. The median age was 85 years (IQR, 82-89), and 61.5% (88/143) were male. In-hospital mortality was lower in the corticosteroid group (68.2%) compared with patients in the non-corticosteroid group (81.8%). Treatment with corticosteroids was an independent survival factor (HR=0.61; 95% CI, 0.41-0.93; P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill older adults with COVID-19 pneumonia, the use of corticosteroid treatment resulted in lower mortality without severe adverse events.","Piniella-Ruiz, Esther; Bellver-Álvarez, María Teresa; Mestre-Gómez, Beatriz; Escolano-Fernández, Belén; Vinat-Prado, Sara; Cabezas-Olea, Rita; Acedo-Gutiérrez, María Soledad; Akasbi-Montalvo, Mirian; Ryan-Murua, Pablo; Bustamante-Fermosel, Ana; Muñoz-Rivas, Nuria; Santamaría-García, Carmen; Pardo-Guimerá, Virginia; Ulla-Anés, Mariano; Franco-Moreno, Anabel; Torres-Macho, Juna","J. gerontol.

The aim of the current study was to explore the intracellular and potent systemic effects of TcdB on human colon epithelial cells utilizing Gene Expression Omnibus and bioinformatic methods. METHODS: Two datasets (GSE63880 and GSE29008) were collected to extract data components of mRNA of TcdB-treated human colon epithelial cells; ""limma"" package of ""R"" software was used to screen the differential genes, and ""pheatmap"" package was applied to construct heat maps for the differential genes; Metascape website was utilized for protein-protein interaction network and Molecular Complex Detection analysis, and Genome Ontology (GO) was used to analyze the selected differential genes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were performed to validate the expression of hub genes. RESULTS: GO terms involved in DNA replication and cell cycle were identified significantly enriched in TcdB-treated human colon epithelial cells. Moreover, the decreased expression of DNA replication-related genes, MCM complex, and CDC45 in C. difficile (TcdA-/TcdB+)-infected Caco-2 cells were validated via qRT-PCR and Western blot assays. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the integrated analysis of different gene expression datasets allowed us to identify a set of genes and GO terms underlying the mechanisms of CDI induced by TcdB. It would aid in understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying TcdB-exposed colon epithelial cells and provide the basis for developing diagnosis biomarkers, treatment, and prevention strategies.","Gao, Yan; Gao, Weihu; Cheng, Jingwei; Ma, Liyan; Su, Jianrong",Int. microbiol,117,18

Therefore, there is an urgent need for an updated systematic literature review that analyzes individual children rather than aggregated data in broad age groups. METHODS: Six databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, Google Scholar, medRxiv) were searched for studies indexed from January 1 to May 15, 2020, with MeSH terms: children, pediatrics, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. 1241 records were identified, of which only unique papers in English with individual patient information and documented COVID-19 testing were included. This review of 22 eligible studies followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses of individual participant data guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 123 patients from five countries were identified. 46% were females. The median age was 5 years (IQR = 8). At presentation, 62% had a fever, 32% had a cough, 58% had a single symptom, and 21% were asymptomatic. Abnormal chest imaging was seen in 62% (65/105) of imaged and 76.9% (20/26) of asymptomatic children. A minority of children had elevated platelets, CRP, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer. CONCLUSION: Data from this independent participant data systematic review revealed that the majority of children with COVID-19 presented with either no symptoms or a single, non-respiratory symptom. IMPACT: This systematic review revealed that the majority of children with COVID-19 presented with either no symptoms or a single, non-respiratory symptom. By using an independent participant data approach, this analysis underscores the challenge of diagnosing COVID-19 in pediatric patients due to the wide variety of symptoms and seemingly poor correlation of imaging findings with symptomatic disease. The data presented from individual patients from case series or cohort studies add more granularity to the current description of pediatric COVID-19.","Christophers, Briana; Gallo Marin, Benjamin; Oliva, Rocío; Powell, Weston T; Savage, Timothy J; Michelow, Ian C",Pediatr. res,117,1

METHODS: A telephone interview study was conducted at the end of April 2020. A qualitative, phenomenological approach was chosen to identify themes and concepts and a semi-structured interview guide was developed. The analysis was structured according to constructs from the theory of planned behaviour, including attitudes to breast cancer screening, norms and motivations to comply with breast cancer screening, perceived control and anticipated regret. RESULTS: Interviews were carried out with 33 women aged 50-69 (mean 62) years. The women felt that screening was of secondary importance during the height of the pandemic and they felt low perceived control over transportation to the screening clinic and over the screening situation itself, where social distancing was impossible. They perceived messages from the authorities as conflicting regarding the request for social distancing and a lack of recommendations about using face masks at the screening clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Women who postponed or cancelled breast cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic felt that public recommendations appeared contradictory. Uncertainty about the 'new norm(al)' of COVID-19 made them stay at home, although the screening clinics remained open. The findings point to the importance of addressing perceived inconsistency between recommendations from the World Health Organization and the national management of these recommendations, and to secure univocal information from the authorities about the recommended use of healthcare services in a time of crisis.","Kirkegaard, Pia; Edwards, Adrian; Andersen, Berit",Scand J Public Health,117,19

Research on SARS-CoV-2, as well as the closely related SARS-CoV-1 and MERS coronaviruses is restricted to BSL-3 facilities. Such BSL-3 classification make SARS-CoV-2 research inaccessible to the majority of functioning research laboratories in the US; this becomes problematic when the collective scientific effort needs to be focused on such in the face of a pandemic. However, a minimal system capable of recapitulating different steps of the viral life cycle without using the virus' genetic material could increase accessibility. In this work, we assessed the four structural proteins from SARS-CoV-2 for their ability to form virus-like particles (VLPs) from human cells to form a competent system for BSL-2 studies of SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we provide methods and resources of producing, purifying, fluorescently and APEX2-labeling of SARS-CoV-2 VLPs for the evaluation of mechanisms of viral budding and entry as well as assessment of drug inhibitors under BSL-2 conditions.

Materials and Methods: This study included 306 volunteer adults who applied to our dental clinic for dental interventions during the early days of COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey. All patients responded to a newly created questionnaire composed of four sections with 19 questions those mostly assessing the social and demographic details; like the participant's age, gender, marital status, education status, medical history, basic dental hygiene habits, occupation, and general information about the COVID-19 infection and its protection methods. Results: The outcomes of 306 participants revealed that their gender, age, and education status showed significant distinctions about the dissemination of coronavirus via dental interventions. Higher education status was linked to a loftier level of social awareness about the COVID-19 infection and its potential associations with dental interventions. It was observed that the participants were unsatisfactorily cautious against the COVID-19 infection and its dissemination pathways in their social environment, particularly in the specific case of systematic diseases and preventive measures. The primary way of obtaining information about the COVID-19 infection was the electronic websites.

Amyloidoses are classified into two as systemic and localized. Out of the systemic forms, AL (light chain) amyloidosis is the most prevalent type; however, amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis is more frequently encountered in the rheumatology practice. AA amyloidosis stands out as a major complication of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Splenic and renal involvement is more likely in FMF-associated systemic amyloidosis. The involvement of thyroid and adrenal glands has also been described, although infrequently. Amyloidoses have a heterogeneous plethora of clinical manifestations, with certain phenotypes associated with specific amyloid forms. Gynecological amyloidosis is a rare condition. Uterine involvement may occur in a localized fashion or may also arise as a part of systemic involvement, albeit at a lesser ratio. Several cases of uterine AL amyloidosis have been documented so far as an organ involvement in systemic AL amyloidosis. On the other hand, uterine amyloidosis associated with AA amyloidosis has been described merely in one case with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here, we presented a 40-year-old female patient with FMF known for 38 years who underwent splenectomy and hysterectomy due to massive splenomegaly, deep anemia, and persistent menometrorrhagia. Histological examinations of materials revealed uterine and splenic AA amyloidosis. This case report is first-of-its-kind to describe FMF-associated uterine AA amyloidosis and also provides a discussion of possible mechanisms of amyloidosis-induced uterine bleeding.","Cansu, Döndü Üsküdar; Teke, Hava Üsküdar; Arik, Deniz; Korkmaz, Cengiz",Rheumatol Int,117,3

An effective and practical MV weaning protocol is needed for these fragile cases. CASE SUMMARY Here, we present two critical COVID-19 patients who presented with fever, cough and fatigue. COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed based on blood cell counts, chest computed tomography (CT) imaging, and nuclei acid test results. To address the patients' respiratory failure, they first received noninvasive ventilation (NIV). When their condition did not improve after 2 h of NIV, each patient was advanced to MV [tidal volume (Vt), 6 mL/kg ideal body weight (IBW); 8-10 cmH 2O of positive end-expiratory pressure; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/min; and 40%-80% FiO 2] with prone positioning for 12 h/day for the first 5 d of MV. Extensive infection control measures were conducted to minimize morbidity, and pharmacotherapy consisting of an antiviral, immune-enhancer, and thrombosis prophylactic was administered in both cases. Upon resolution of lung changes evidenced by CT, the patients were sequentially weaned using a weaning screening test, spontaneous breathing test, and airbag leak test. After withdrawal of MV, the patients were transitioned through NIV and high-flow nasal cannula oxygen support. Both patients recovered well. CONCLUSION A MV protocol attentive to intubation/extubation timing, prone positioning early in MV, infection control, and sequential withdrawal of respiratory support, may be an effective regimen for patients with critical COVID-19.","Peng, Mian; Ren, Di; Liu, Yong-Feng; Meng, Xi; Wu, Ming; Chen, Rong-Lin; Yu, Bao-Jun; Tao, Long-Cheng; Chen, Li; Lai, Zeng-Qiao",World J.

We investigated the relationship between ethnicity and health outcomes in SARS-CoV-2. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective, observational analysis of SARS-CoV-2 patients across two London teaching hospitals during March 1 -April 30, 2020. Routinely collected clinical data were extracted and analysed for 645 patients who met the study inclusion criteria. Within this hospitalised cohort, the BAME population were younger relative to the white population (61.70 years, 95% CI 59.70-63.73 versus 69.3 years, 95% CI 67.17-71.43, p<0.001). When adjusted for age, sex and comorbidity, ethnicity was not a predictor for ICU admission. The mean age at death was lower in the BAME population compared to the white population (71.44 years, 95% CI 69.90-72.90 versus, 77.40 years, 95% CI 76.1-78.70 respectively, p<0.001). When adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities, Asian patients had higher odds of death (OR 1.99: 95% CI 1.22-3.25, p<0.006). CONCLUSIONS: BAME patients were more likely to be admitted younger, and to die at a younger age with SARS-CoV-2. Within the BAME cohort, Asian patients were more likely to die but despite this, there was no difference in rates of admission to ICU. The reasons for these disparities are not fully understood and need to be addressed. Investigating ethnicity as a clinical risk factor remains a high public health priority. Studies that consider ethnicity as part of the wider socio-cultural determinant of health are urgently needed.","Patel, Aatish; Abdulaal, Ahmed; Ariyanayagam, David; Killington, Kieran; Denny, Sarah J; Mughal, Nabeela; Hughes, Stephen; Goel, Nupur; Davies, Gary W; Moore, Luke S P; Charani, Esmita",PLoS One,117,16

AIM: Summarize the most relevant data from a literature systematic review on the impact on youths' physical health of the 2020 school closure and social distances measures implemented in response to covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: Authors of the original review searched on 11 international databases up to 1st September 2020 to retrieve cohort studies, cross sectional surveys, uncontrolled pre-post studies and modelling studies. Methodological quality has been assessed with validated checklists. RESULTS: Forty-two studies reporting the impact on physical health have been finally included. They have been conducted in 14 countries, most of which in Italy (30.9%) and UK (30.9%). The majority were cohort studies (40.5%) and the overall methodological quality, irrespective of study designs, was high for the 71.4% of the studies. Twenty-seven studies assessed the impact on health services utilization, whose results showed a relevant reduction of Emergency Departments accesses (64%-89.3%) and hospital admissions (31%-85%); however, an increase of acute cases was observed together with delayed admission. An important reduction of vaccine services utilization was also noted during the first period of lockdown. Domestic accidents and head trauma for suspected domestic violence increased. Health related behaviours worsened, with a relevant increase of screen time (mean of 2.9 hours to 5.1 hours), an important reduction of physical activity (up to 64%). Finally, sleep problems and increase of food consumption, particularly the unhealthy food were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Relevant negative effects of school closure and social distances measures have observed. All the studies have been conducted during the first wave of pandemic and assessed the short-term effect of closures implemented for relatively short periods. If school closure and rigid social distances measures imposition will extend for a long time, an even more pronounced negative effect can be expected. In the context of health policies, in addition to the potential benefits of school closures and social distancing measures on the containment of infection, the potential damage on the physical health of young people should be taken into account by implementing policies to safeguard their health.","Saulle, Rosella; Minozzi, Silvia; Amato, Laura; Davoli, Marina",Recenti Prog Med,117,24

This study aims to assess the current water supply service levels and water supply inequalities of WUSAs in terms of water consumption, supply hours, and customer satisfaction. Among the three types of water service providers, WUSAs offered the best performance in terms of their low non-revenue water (NRW) rates and production costs, high bill collection rates, and long supply hours. During the COVID-19 lockdown, water consumption increased, but bill payment notably decreased, possibly due to restricted movement and hesitation by customers to make payments. The multiple-year water consumption variations illustrated the uneven water consumption behavior of customers. Despite the variation in water supply hours, Lorenz curves, Gini coefficients (G), and water consumption analysis depicted low inequalities (G ≈ 0.20–0.28) and adequate water consumption among WUSAs even in 2019–2020. In the three WUSAs, more than 90%, 74%, and 38% of customers consumed water above the basic, medium, and high levels, respectively. Thus, maintaining high service levels of WUSAs is instrumental in achieving Goal 6 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Nepal.","Shrestha, Arati Kazama Shinobu Takizawa Satoshi",Water,117,29

RESULTS: We illustrate the use of our web app in extracting social distancing, social relaxation, surveillance or virulence switching functions (i.e., time varying drivers) from the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 epidemics in Israel, South Africa, and England. The Israeli outbreak exhibits four distinct phases: initial outbreak, social distancing, social relaxation, and a second wave mitigation phase. An MCMC projection of this latter phase suggests the Israeli epidemic will continue to produce into late November an average of around 1500 new case per day, unless the population practices social-relaxation measures at least 5-fold below the level in August, which itself is 4-fold below the level at the start of July. Our analysis of the relatively late South African outbreak that became the world's fifth largest COVID-19 epidemic in July revealed that the decline through late July and early August was characterised by a social distancing driver operating at more than twice the per-capita applicable-disease-class (pc-adc) rate of the social relaxation driver. Our analysis of the relatively early English outbreak, identified a more than 2-fold improvement in surveillance over the course of the epidemic. It also identified a pc-adc social distancing rate in early August that, though nearly four times the pc-adc social relaxation rate, appeared to barely contain a second wave that would break out if social distancing was further relaxed. CONCLUSION: Our web app provides policy makers and health officers who have no epidemiological modelling or computer coding expertise with an invaluable tool for assessing the impacts of different outbreak mitigation policies and measures.

It is desirable to design and evaluate interpretable feature extraction techniques to describe the patient's condition. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 170 confirmed patients with COVID-19 or bacterial pneumonia acquired at Yeungnam University Hospital in Daegu, Korea. The Lung and lesion regions were segmented to crop the lesion into 2D patches to train a classifier model that could differentiate between COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. The K-means algorithm was used to cluster deep features extracted by the trained model into 20 groups. Each lesion patch cluster was described by a characteristic imaging term for comparison. For each CT image containing multiple lesions, a histogram of lesion types was constructed using the cluster information. Finally, a Support Vector Machine classifier was trained with the histogram and radiomics features to distinguish diseases and severity. RESULTS: The 20 clusters constructed from 170 patients were reviewed based on common radiographic appearance types. Two clusters showed typical findings of COVID-19, with two other clusters showing typical findings related to bacterial pneumonia. Notably, there is one cluster that showed bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the central and peripheral lungs and was considered to be a key factor for severity classification. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 91.2% for classifying COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia patients with 95% reported for severity classification. The CT quantitative parameters represented by the values of cluster 8 were correlated with existing laboratory data and clinical parameters. CONCLUSION: Deep chest CT analysis with constructed lesion clusters revealed well-known COVID-19 CT manifestations comparable to manual CT analysis. The constructed histogram features improved accuracy for both diseases and severity classification, and showed correlations with laboratory data and clinical parameters. The constructed histogram features can provide guidance for improved analysis and treatment of COVID-19.","Kang, Myeongkyun; Hong, Kyung Soo; Chikontwe, Philip; Luna, Miguel; Jang, Jong Geol; Park, Jongsoo; Shin, Kyeong Cheol; Park, Sang Hyun; Ahn, June Hong",J Korean Med Sci,117,1

The coronavirus spike proteins are very effective molecular mechanisms, which provide the coronavirus entrance to the host cell. The number of these spikes is different; it dramatically depends on external conditions and determines the degree of danger of the virus. A larger number of spike proteins makes the virus infectivity stronger. This paper describes a mathematical model of the shape of coronavirus virions. Based on this model, the characteristics of light scattered by the coronavirus virions were calculated. It was found two main features of coronavirus model particles in the spectral region near 200nm: a minimum of intensity and a sharp leap of the linear polarization degree. The effect of the spike protein number on the intensity and polarization properties of the scattered light was studied. It was determined that when the number of spike proteins decreases, both the intensity minimum and the position of the linear polarization leap shift to shorter wavelengths. This allows us to better evaluate the shape of the coronavirus virion, and, therefore, the infectious danger of the virus. It was shown that the shorter the wavelength of scattered light, the more reliably one can distinguish viruses from non-viruses. The developed model and the light scattering simulations based on it can be applied not only to coronaviruses, but also to other objects of a similar structure, for example, pollen.","Petrov, Dmitry",J Quant Spectrosc Radiat Transf,117,1

The functional plasticity of Tregs is a key feature of this lineage, as it allows them to adapt to different microenvironments, adopt transcriptional programs reflective of their environments and tailor their suppressive capacity in a context-dependent fashion. Tregs, particularly effector Tregs (eTregs), are abundant in many types of tumors. However, the functional and transcriptional plasticity of eTregs in tumors remain largely to be explored. Although depletion or inhibition of systemic Tregs can enhance anti-tumor responses, autoimmune sequelae have diminished the enthusiasm for such approaches. A more effective approach should specifically target intratumoral Tregs or subvert local Treg-mediated suppression. This mini-review will discuss the reported mechanisms by which the stability and suppressive function of tumoral Tregs are modulated, with the focus on eTregs and a subset of eTregs, follicular regulatory T (TFR) cells, and how to harness this knowledge for the future development of new effective cancer immunotherapies that selectively target the tumor local response while sparing the systemic side effects.","Dixon, Michael L; Leavenworth, Jonathan D; Leavenworth, Jianmei W",Front Immunol,117,16

The principal motivation behind the composition is the eruption of the COVID-19 global pandemics, which has forced migrant labours (the engine of a globalized economic system) to shift from the urban areas to their origin. This migration crisis has put a serious challenge for the revitalization of the city economy in the post lockdown period. Further, this raises the question can the city provides the migrants better opportunities and benefits to get them to return? In contrast to standard migration models that attempted to limit the migration into the cities, our new theoretical perspective highlights the importance of agglomeration economies, urban informal sector and the development of core urban infrastructure to catalyse agglomeration externalities in the process of urban development and accommodating rural–urban migrants. The presentation of urban political economy into the theoretical account of migration leads to the importance of policies to augment agglomeration economies. These include the provision of infrastructure and affordable housing and mitigate congestion diseconomies in the form of sprawl, slums, poverty, traffic bottlenecks and so forth. Stopping migration or wage subsidy to the urban producer is not only unrealistic but also a myopic solution. On the contrary, cities should be prepared with planning, financing and governance mechanism to create the infrastructure needed by employment-generating activities, catalysing agglomeration-led and knowledge-powered growth. In the end, our model suggests any approach to deal with urbanization issues in India must bring into account the critical part played by migrants-urban poor and address their needs while benefitting rural areas. The migrants-urban poor do not need charity. They need to be recognised as partners in the wealth creation process of cities and deserve ‘right to the city’ on their merit. While markets have failed them in the past, governments have also not catered to their needs. The urban planning and governance processes which failed to recognise the ‘location’ and ‘access’ of the poor urban migrants need to be reformed.","Panwar, Namrata. S.; Mishra, Alok Kumar",J.

Against the backdrop of this pandemic, it becomes imperative to study the effects of this infection on pregnancy and its outcome. Hence, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 infection on the maternal morbidity and mortality, the course of labour as well as the neonatal outcome. Materials and Methods: A total of 977 pregnant women were included in the study, from 1st April to 15th May 2020 at a tertiary care hospital. There were 141 women who tested COVID positive and remaining 836 patients were included in the COVID negative group. Findings were compared in both the groups. Results: The incidence of COVID positive pregnant women was found to be 14.43%. More patients delivered by LSCS in the COVID positive and the COVID negative group (50%) as compared to COVID negative group (47%), (p &gt; 0.05). Low APGAR score (0-3) was observed in 2(1.52%) neonates of COVID positive mothers and in 15 (1.91%) neonates of COVID negative mothers. Overall most of the babies were healthy. Out of all babies tested, 3 were detected positive initially which were retested on day 5 and were found to be negative. Conclusion: There is no significant effect of COVID infection on maternal and foetal outcome in pregnancy and there is no evidence of vertical transmission of the COVID-19 infection but long-term follow-up of these babies is recommended.","Nayak, Arun Harishchandra; Kapote, Deepali Swapnil; Fonseca, Michelle; Chavan, Niranjan; Mayekar, Rahul; Sarmalkar, Meenal; Bawa, Amarjeet",J.

Methods: To search all the clinical studies about COVID-19 which were registered on the Chinese and U.S. NIH official clinical trial registration websites until March 9, 2020. The search terms were ""new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), 2019-nCoV, novel coronavirus pneumonia"". Results: Overall, 360 studies with a total sample size of 268, 773 participants are registered on Chinese clinical trial registration website, and 74 studies with a total sample size of 73, 723 participants in the U.S. NIH clinical trial registration website. According to the information provided by the Chinese Clinical Trial Registration Website, there are 237 interventional studies, 108 observational studies, and 15 diagnostic test studies; and the most commonly studied interventions were Traditional Chinese Medicine in 80 studies, antiviral therapy in 58 studies, stem cells in 19 studies, plasma of recovered patients in 13 studies, glucocorticoid in 7 studies, molecular targeted therapy in 4 studies, and vaccine in 2 studies. According to the information provided by the U.S. NIH Clinical Trial Registration Website, there were 54 interventional studies, 17 observational studies, and 3 diagnostic test studies; and the most commonly studied interventions were antiviral therapy in 16 studies, stem cells in 7 studies, Traditional Chinese Medicine in 6 studies, molecular targeted therapy in 3 studies, and vaccine in 3 studies. Conclusions Numerous clinical studies related to COVID-19 have been registered during a very short period. Among them, Traditional Chinese Medicine is the most commonly studied intervention, which suggests the Chinese characteristics in medical care.

The objectives of this study were to compare COVID-19 pandemic and pre-pandemic periods with respect to regional volumes, outcomes, and treatment of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) between 01/01/19-3/14/20 (pre-COVID period) and between 3/15/20-4/25/20 (COVID period) in 51 New York State hospitals certified to perform PCI. The hospitals were classified as being in either high-density or low-density COVID-19 counties on the basis of deaths/10,000 population. There was a decrease of 43% in procedures/week in high-density COVID-19 counties (P < 0.0001) and only 4% in low-density counties (Pâ¯=â¯0.64). There was no difference in the change in risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality rates in either type of county, but STEMI PCI patients in high-density counties had longer times from symptom onset to hospital arrival and lower cardiac arrest rates in the pandemic period. In conclusion, the decrease in STEMI PCIs during the pandemic was mainly limited to counties with a high density of COVID-19 deaths. The decrease appears to be primarily related to patients not presenting to hospitals in high-density COVID regions, rather than PCI being avoided among STEMI patients or a reduction in the incidence of STEMI. Also, high-density COVID-19 counties experienced delayed admissions and less severely ill STEMI PCI patients during the pandemic. This information can serve to focus efforts on convincing STEMI patients to seek life-saving hospital care during the pandemic.","Hannan, Edward L; Wu, Yifeng; Cozzens, Kimberly; Friedrich, Marcus; Tamis-Holland, Jacqueline; Jacobs, Alice K; Ling, Frederick S K; King, Spencer B; Venditti, Ferdinand J; Walford, Gary; Berger, Peter B; Kirtane, Ajay J; Kamran, Mazullah",Am. j. cardiol,117,16

Combined swabs showed a positivity rate of 100% followed by NPS (91.5%), OPS (72.3%), sputum (63%), while nCoV was found undetected in urine, plasma and serum specimens. The lowest cycle threshold (Ct) values of targeted genes E, ORF1b and RdRP are 10.56, 10.14 and 12.26 respectively and their lowest average Ct values were found in combined swab which indicates high viral load in combined swab among all other specimen types. Analysis of 665 follow-up multi-varied specimens also showed combined swab as the last specimen among all specimen types to become negative, after an average 6.6 (range 4-10) days post-treatment, having lowest (15.48) and average (29.96) Ct values of ORF1b respectively indicating posterior nasopharyngeal tract as primary nCoV afflicted site with high viral load. CONCLUSION: The combined swab may be recommended as a more appropriate specimen for both diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 treatment by rRT-PCR for assessing virus clearance to help physicians in taking evidence-based decision before discharging patients. Implementing combined swabs globally will definitely help in management and control of the pandemic, as it is the need of the hour.","Sharma, Kuldeep; Aggarwala, Pragya; Gandhi, Deepa; Mathias, Anuniti; Singh, Priyanka; Sharma, Somya; Negi, Sanjay Singh; Bhargava, Anudita; Das, Padma; Gaikwad, Ujjwala; Wankhede, Archana; Behra, Ajoy; Nagarkar, Nitin M",PLoS One,117,20

Data about vertical transmission of Covid-19 are still limited and controversial: in most cases, although a positive mother, the virus could not be isolated in amniotic fluid, cord blood, breast milk or neonatal throat swab in these patients. No data have been published about possible intrauterine sonographic signs of infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A pregnant woman was diagnosed with SARS-CoV2 at 35+5 weeks of gestation and managed conservatively at home. At transabdominal ultrasound at 38+3 weeks, fetal bowel and gallbladder calcifications were noted. CMV and other infectious agents were ruled out; an iterative Caesarean Section was performed at 38+5 weeks without complications. Placenta resulted negative for SARS-CoV-2; the umbilical cord blood sample was IgG positive and IgM negative as per maternal infection. The baby developed respiratory distress syndrome requiring endotracheal surfactant administration and nasal-CPAP for one day but nasopharyngeal swabs at birth and after 48 hours were SARS-Cov2 negative. Neonatal abdominal ultrasound showed normal liver, acalculous gallbladder with mild parietal thickening. The baby was discharged in good conditions. CONCLUSIONS: although gallbladder calcifications and echogenic bowel are highly suspicious of viral infection and were thought to be due to the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, these findings were not corroborated by the results of our diagnostic tests; these sonographic findings might represent a false positive of fetal infection in mother affected by COVID-19 since vertical transmission appears to be rare.","Sileo, Filomena G; Tramontano, Anna L; Leone, Chiara; Meacci, Marisa; Gennari, William; Ternelli, Giliana; La Marca, Antonio; Lugli, Licia; Berardi, Alberto; Facchinetti, Fabio; Bertucci, Emma",Minerva ginecol,117,1

Understanding the perspectives of health care consumers on COVID-19 will play a crucial role in the development of effective risk communication strategies. This study aimed to examine COVID-19-related risk perceptions, knowledge, and information sources among prenatal and postnatal Chinese women during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey design was adopted, and a four-section online questionnaire was used to collect data. Using a social media platform, the online survey was administered to 161 participants during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Nanjing, China, in February 2020. RESULTS: The participants perceived their risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19 to be lower than their risk of contracting influenza, however many of them were worried that they might contract COVID-19. The participants demonstrated adequate knowledge about COVID-19. The three major sources from which they obtained information about COVID-19 were doctors, nurses/midwives, and the television, and they placed a high level of confidence in these sources. There was no significant relationship between the perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 and knowledge about this disease. CONCLUSION: The present findings offer valuable insights to healthcare professionals, including midwives, who serve on the frontline and provide care to pregnant women. Although the participants were adequately knowledgeable about COVID-19, they had misunderstood some of the recommendations of the World Health Organisation.","Lee, Tsorng-Yeh; Zhong, Yaping; Zhou, Jie; He, Xiaojuan; Kong, Rui; Ji, Ji",Women and birth (Online),117,3

The pandemic brought into light structural weaknesses of the health system, including its governance and decision-making process, but also provoked changes that helped to improve its resilience. We analyse the French experience of Covid-19 in 2020 by critically reviewing major policy measures implemented during the first two waves of the pandemic. France has struggled to find the right balance between the rock of economic and social damage caused by containment measures and the hard alternative of a rapidly spreading pandemic. The response to the first wave, including a full lock-down, was an emergency response that revealed the low level of preparedness for pandemics and the overly hospital-centred provision of health care in France. During the second wave, this response evolved into a more level strategy trying to reconcile health needs in a broader perspective integrating socio-economic considerations, but without fully managing to put in place an effective health strategy. We conclude that to achieve the right balance, France will have to strengthen health system capacity and improve the cooperation between actors at central and local levels with greater participatory decision-making that takes into account local-level realities and the diversity of needs.","Or, Zeynep; Gandré, Coralie; Durand Zaleski, Isabelle; Steffen, Monika",Health Econ Policy Law,117,16

Up to this moment, there are no signs of remission and there is no proven effective cure. The vaccine is the primary biomedical preventive measure against the novel coronavirus. However, the public bias or sentiments, as reflected on social media, may have significant impact on the progress to achieve the herd immunity needed principally. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to use machine learning methods to extract public topics and sentiments on the COVID-19 vaccination on Twitter. METHODS: We collected 31,100 English tweets containing COVID-19 vaccine-related keywords between January and October 2020 from Australian Twitter users. Specifically, we analyzed the tweets by visualizing the high-frequency word clouds and correlations between word tokens. We built the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model to identify the commonly discussed topics from massive tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis to understand the overall sentiments and emotions on COVID-19 vaccination in the Australian society. RESULTS: Our analysis identified three LDA topics including ""Attitudes towards COVID-19 and its vaccination"", ""Advocating infection control measures against COVID-19"", and ""Misconceptions and complaints about COVID-19 control"". In all tweets, nearly two-thirds of the sentiments were positive, and around one-third were negative in the public opinion about the COVID-19 vaccine. Among the eight basic emotions, ""trust"" and ""anticipation"" were the two prominent positive emotions, while ""fear"" was the top negative emotion in the tweets. CONCLUSIONS: Our new findings indicate that some Australian Twitter users supported infection control measures against COVID-19, and would refute misinformation. However, the others who underestimated the risks and severity of COVID-19 would probably rationalize their position on the COVID-19 vaccinations with certain conspiracy theories. It is also noticed that the level of positive sentiment in the public may not be enough to further a vaccination coverage which would be sufficient to achieve vaccination-induced herd immunity. Governments should explore the public opinion and sentiments towards COVID-19 and its vaccination, and implement an effective vaccination promotion scheme besides supporting the development and clinical administration of COVID-19 vaccines.","Kwok, Stephen Wai Hang; Vadde, Sai Kumar; Wang, Guanjin",J. med. internet res,117,1

This should occur through a process of community input, with emphasis on how such missions can resist colonial structures. Such discussions must be rooted in the historical context of the violent colonialism in the Americas and across the globe that has accompanied exploration of Earth. The structures created by settler colonialism are very much alive today, impact the scientific community, and are currently replicated in the space exploration communities' plans for human exploration and in-situ resource utilization. These discussions must lead to enforceable planetary protection policies that create a framework for ethical exploration of other worlds. Current policy does not adequately address questions related to in-situ resource utilization and environmental preservation and is without enforcement mechanisms. Further, interactions with potential extraterrestrial life have scientific and moral stakes. Decisions on these topics will be made in the coming decade as the Artemis program enables frequent missions to the Moon and crewed missions to Mars. Those first choices will have irreversible consequences for the future of human space exploration and must be extremely well considered, with input from those beyond the scientific community, including expertise from the humanities and members of the general public. Without planetary protection policy that actively resists colonial practices, they will be replicated in our interactions and exploration of other planetary bodies.

Other known coronaviruses show a strong pattern of seasonality, with the infection cases in humans being more prominent in winter. Although several plausible origins of such seasonal variability have been proposed, its mechanism is unclear. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne droplets ejected from the upper respiratory tract of the infected individuals. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious for hours on surfaces. As such, the stability of viral particles both in liquid droplets as well as dried on surfaces is essential for infectivity. Here we have used atomic force microscopy to examine the structural stability of individual SARS-CoV-2 virus like particles at different temperatures. We demonstrate that even a mild temperature increase, commensurate with what is common for summer warming, leads to dramatic disruption of viral structural stability, especially when the heat is applied in the dry state. This is consistent with other existing non-mechanistic studies of viral infectivity, provides a single particle perspective on viral seasonality, and strengthens the case for a resurgence of COVID-19 in winter.","Sharma, A; Preece, B; Swann, H; Fan, X; McKenney, R J; Ori-McKenney, K M; Saffarian, S; Vershinin, M D",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,117,16

Thorough examinations reveal no other explanations. Nitrofurantoin was discontinued and the girl was treated with methylprednisolone. After 17 month a new scan and lung function test showed total regression of the lung fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: This case underlines that risk of severe side effects should be taken in to account before initiation of long-term nitrofurantoin treatment in children.","Mikkelsen, Lise Fischer; Rubak, Sune",BMC Pulm Med,117,21

The use of music in mindfulness is apparent in several traditional and Western practices but has little research regarding its effect in novice practitioners. In an online course-based research experience, a group of student researchers, a graduate research assistant and two faculty members recruited 54 healthy participants within their social networks, to investigate the effect of a music stimulus on one mindfulness exercise and the feasibility of implementing this intervention in virtual sessions. Participants attended two virtual group sessions where student researchers and a faculty member/research assistant provided online questionnaires and links to a 20-minute meditation recording, either with or without music, as the two conditions. Potential moderators of the intervention included stress in the previous month and absorption in music. A repeated-measures ANCOVA indicated no significant differences among conditions, and no interaction with stress or absorption in music. Although contrary to our expectations, the lack of significant differences between conditions indicate that music did not distract from a mindfulness meditation, and that the music and guided mindfulness stimulus was as efficacious as the guided mindfulness alone. Given the potential for music to become a distractor for novice practitioners, this finding is important and in line with our theoretical framework. Online delivery of this intervention was feasible and apparently effective. Suggestions for implementation of online research and intervention delivery are included.","Hernandez-Ruiz, Eugenia Sebren Ann Alderete Celeste Bradshaw Liesel Fowler Ryan",The Arts in Psychotherapy,117,21

Here, the vaccinia virus-based, replication-defective Sementis Copenhagen Vector (SCV) was used to develop a first-generation COVID-19 vaccine encoding the spike glycoprotein (SCV-S). Vaccination of mice rapidly induced polyfunctional CD8 T cells with cytotoxic activity and robust Th1-biased, spike-specific neutralizing antibodies, which are significantly increased following a second vaccination, and contained neutralizing activity against the alpha and beta variants of concern. Longitudinal studies indicated neutralizing antibody activity was maintained up to 9 months post-vaccination in both young and aging mice, with durable immune memory evident even in the presence of pre-existing vector immunity. This immunogenicity profile suggests a potential to expand protection generated by current vaccines in a heterologous boost format, and presents a solid basis for second-generation SCV-based COVID-19 vaccine candidates incorporating additional SARS-CoV-2 immunogens.","Eldi, Preethi; Cooper, Tamara H; Prow, Natalie A; Liu, Liang; Heinemann, Gary K; Zhang, Voueleng J; Trinidad, Abigail D; Guzman-Genuino, Ruth Marian; Wulff, Peter; Hobbs, Leanne M; Diener, Kerrilyn R; Hayball, John D",,117,12

However, the timing of the magmatism in the Okinawa Trough (OT) is not well constrained by the age spectra of zircons. Here, for the first time, we carry out an integrated study combining in situ analysis of zircon U-Th-Pb and Hf-O isotopes, and trace element compositions of zircons from the volcanic rocks from the southernmost part of the OT. We found that the young (< 100 ka) zircons in these volcanic rocks have old (108 Ma to 2.7 Ga) inherited cores, which were captured as the magma ascended through the rifting continental crust. In particular, the inherited Archean zircons strongly suggest that remnants of the old East Asian continental blocks underlie the embryonic crustal rifting zone. Moreover, the ages of most of the inherited zircons correspond to five supercontinent amalgamation events. Specifically, the Archaean inherited zircons, which have positive ÎµHf(t) and low Î´18O values, correspond to the formation of juvenile continental crust. In contrast, the negative ÎµHf(t) and high Î´18O values of the post-Archaean inherited zircons indicate that their parental magma contained recycled older crust due to the enhanced crust-mantle interactions during the evolution of the early continental crust. Therefore, the inherited zircons in the back-arc volcanic rocks not only reflect the evolution of the local magmatism, but they also contain a record of the Archaean crustal fragment and of several global continental amalgamation events.","Zeng, Zhi-Gang; Chen, Zu-Xing; Zhang, Yu-Xiang",Sci Rep,117,32

All elective cases at our institution were postponed for approximately 3 months. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services considers organ transplant surgery a Tier 3b case, along with other high acuity procedures, recommending no postponement. Our transplant program collaborated with our transplant infectious disease colleagues to create a protocol that would ensure both patient and staff safety during these unprecedented times. METHODS: The living donor program was electively placed on hold until we had the proper protocols in place. Preoperative COVID-19 testing was required for all recipients and living donors. All patients underwent a rapid nasopharyngeal swab test. After testing negative by nasopharyngeal swab, recipients also underwent a low-radiation-dose computed tomography scan to rule out any radiographic changes suggestive of a COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: We performed 8 living donor and 9 deceased donor kidney transplants. In comparison, we performed 10 living donor and 4 deceased donor transplants during the same time period in the previous year. Our testing protocol enabled efficient use of all suitable organs offered during the viral pandemic. No recipients or living donors tested positive or developed COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Creation of a viral testing protocol, developed in conjunction with our infectious disease team, permitted kidney transplantation to be performed safely, and the number of deceased donor transplants increased considerably without adversely affecting our outcomes.","Butt, Fauzia K; Julian, Kathleen; Kadry, Zakiyah; Jain, Ashokkumar",Transplant. proc,117,16

Previously published papers have demonstrated that increased levels of D-dimer at hospital admission correlate with a more severe disease (0.5 mg/L) or occurrence of death (1 mg/L). The potential prothrombotic action of the SARS-CoV-2 is supported by the topographical involvement of the lung regions with a predilection for the lower lobe with peripheral involvement. If this hypothesis is demonstrated, this could suggest the benefit of using antithrombotic/coagulation regimens for SARS-CoV-2 and, at the same time, the urgency to identify drugs that could alter the inflammatory storm, thus protecting the vessel wall.","Saba, Luca; Sverzellati, Nicola",J. thorac imaging,117,25

This paper examines Knowledge Building in two graduate courses conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were no in-person sessions;rather, synchronous Zoom sessions were combined with asynchronous work in a knowledge building environment--Knowledge Forum. Knowledge Forum is designed to make transparent and accessible means by which deep understanding and sustained creative work proceed. Accordingly, for example, rise-above notes and view rearrangement support synthesis and explanatory coherence, epistemic markers support knowledge-advancing discourse, and analytics support self-and group-monitoring of progress as work proceeds. In this report, we focus on these aspects of Knowledge Building, using a subset of analytics to enhance understanding of key concepts and design of principles-based practices to advance education for knowledge creation. Overall, we aimed to have students take collective responsibility for advancing community knowledge, rather than focus exclusively on individual achievement. As we reflect on our experiences and challenges, we attempt to answer the following questions: Do courses that introduce Knowledge Building in higher education need an in-person or synchronous component? In what ways can we leverage in-class time and Knowledge Forum work to engage students in more advanced knowledge creation? We conclude that synchronous and asynchronous Knowledge Building can be combined in powerful new ways to provide students with more design time and deeper engagement with content and peers.","Soliman, Dina Costa Stacy Scardamalia Marlene",Education Sciences,117,26

However, these models have systematically failed to account for the social and structural factors which lead to socioeconomic, racial, and geographic health disparities. Why do epidemiologic models of emerging infections ignore known structural drivers of disparate health outcomes? What have been the consequences of this limited framework?

In this Perspective, we evaluate potential historical and political explanations for the exclusion of drivers of disparity in infectious disease models for emerging infections, which have often been characterized as""equal opportunity infectors""despite ample evidence to the contrary. We look to examples from other disease systems (HIV, STIs) as a potential blueprint for how social connections, environmental, and structural factors can be integrated into a coherent, rigorous, and interpretable modeling framework.

The aim of this study was to identify the predictors for clinical deterioration in patients with COVID-19 who did not show clinical deterioration upon hospital admission. METHODS: Two hundred fifty-seven patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital between 23 January and 21 March 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities and treatments were all collected. The study endpoint was clinical deterioration within 20 days from hospital admission. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to explore the risk factors associated with clinical deterioration. RESULTS: A total of 49 (19%) patients showed clinical deterioration after admission. Compared with patients that did not experience clinical deterioration, clinically deteriorated patients had more dyspnea, cough and myalgia (65.3% versus 29.3%) symptoms and more had comorbidities (89.8% versus 36.1%). Clinical and laboratory characteristics at admission that were associated with clinical deterioration included senior age, diabetes, hypertension, myalgia, higher temperature, systolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, activated partial thromboplastin time, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, direct bilirubin, plasma creatinine, lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, decreased albumin and bicarbonate concentration. Medical history of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers and metformin were also risk factors. CONCLUSION: The four best predictors for clinical deterioration were CRP, procalcitonin, age and albumin. A ""best"" multivariable prediction model, resulting from using a variable selection procedure, included senior age, presentation with myalgia, and higher level of CRP and serum creatinine (bias-corrected c-statistic = 0.909).

We show that methotrexate, an FDA-approved inhibitor of purine biosynthesis, potently inhibits viral RNA replication, viral protein synthesis, and virus release. The effective antiviral methotrexate concentrations are similar to those used for established human therapies using the same drug. Methotrexate should be most effective in patients at the earliest appearance of symptoms to effectively prevent viral replication, diffusion of the infection, and possibly fatal complications.","Caruso, Arnaldo; Caccuri, Francesca; Bugatti, Antonella; Zani, Alberto; Vanoni, Marco; Bonfanti, Paolo; Cazzaniga, Marina E; Perno, Carlo F; Messa, Cristina; Alberghina, Lilia",J. med. virol,117,16

Although Centers for Disease Control has reported 1,551,095 cases in the United States as of May 21, 2020, asymptomatic infection rates remain unknown within the U.S., especially in geographically disparate regions. Methods: On April 7, 2020 our hospital established universal SARS-CoV-2 screening using RT-PCR RNA detection from nasopharyngeal swabs from asymptomatic patients prior to essential and elective surgeries. This study included 1,997 asymptomatic patients undergoing surgical procedures and 1,797 admitted for medical management at a Midwestern academic hospital between April 7, 2020 and May 21, 2020. Results: As of May 21, asymptomatic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection had been completed for 1,997 surgical patients and 1,797 non-surgical patients. Initial testing was positive in 26 patients, with an additional four positive tests occurring during repeat testing when greater than 48 hours had elapsed since initial testing. Overall asymptomatic infection rate was 0.79%. Asymptomatic infection rate was significantly lower in surgical patients (0.35% vs. 1.28%, p=0.001). Surgical patients tended to be older than non-surgical patients, although this was not statistically significant (51, IQR 27-65 vsx 46, IQR 28-64, p=0.057). Orthopedic surgery patients were significantly younger than those from other surgical services (42 vs. 53 yrs, p<0.001), however orthopedic and non-orthopedic surgical patients had similar asymptomatic infection rates (0.70% vs. 0.25%, p=0.173). Conclusion: Among asymptomatic patients tested at a Midwestern academic medical center, 0.79% were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. These findings will help guide screening protocols at medical centers while providing essential and elective procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the asymptomatic infection rate was low, this data substantiates the threat of asymptomatic infections and potential for community viral spread. These results may not be generalizable to large urban population centers or areas with high concentrations of COVID-19, each region must use available data to evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of universal testing vs universal contact precautions.

Then, we apply a systematic approach to analyze four important themes: Structural issues, Banking system, Firm issues, and Financial psychology and behavior. Overall, there have been three noticeable trends within finance research in Vietnam: (1) assessment of financial policies or financial regulation, (2) deciphering the correlates of firms' financial performances, and (3) opportunities and challenges in adopting innovations and ideas from foreign financial market systems. Our analysis identifies several fertile areas for future research, including financial market analysis in the post-COVID-19 eras, fintech, and green finance.","Ho, M. T.; Le, N. T. B.; Tran, H. L.

Although the majority of patients with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, some are more prone to serious outcomes, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe, life-threatening inflammatory syndrome associated with intense cytokine release (also known as a ""cytokine storm""). Similar to COVID-19, HLH is characterized by aggressive course leading to multi-organ failure. MAIN TEXT: The purpose of this review article is to draw attention to the possibility of the complication of HLH in patients with the severe course of COVID-19. Indeed, some of the clinical characteristics observed in the more severe cases of COVID-19 are reminiscent of secondary HLH (which can be triggered by infections, malignancies, rheumatological diseases, or autoimmune/immunodeficiency conditions). The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection also suggests that HLH or a similar hyperinflammatory syndrome is the cause of the severe course of the infection. CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis and clinical symptoms of severe COVID-19 indicate that an increased inflammatory response corresponding to HLH is occurring. Therefore, patients with severe COVID-19 should be screened for hyperinflammation using standard laboratory tests to identify those for whom immunosuppressive therapy may improve outcomes.","Opoka-Winiarska, Violetta; Grywalska, Ewelina; Rolinski, Jacek",BMC Med,117,22

This retrospective cohort study aimed at investigating Italian adult population lifestyle changes during COVID-19 pandemic ""Phase 1"" lockdown (8 March-4 May 2020) and discriminate between positive and negative changes and BMI (body mass index) variations (&#916;BMI). METHODS: A multiple-choice web-form survey was used to collect retrospective data regarding lifestyle/eating behaviours during ""Phase 1"" in the Italian adult population. According to changes in lifestyle/eating behaviours, the sample was divided into three classes of changes: ""negative change"", ""no change"", ""positive change"". For each class, correlations with &#916;BMI were investigated. RESULTS: Data were collected from 1304 subjects (973F/331M). Mean &#916;BMI differed significantly (p < 0.001) between classes, and was significantly related to water intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, frequency of ""craving or snacking between meals"", dessert/sweets consumption at lunch. CONCLUSIONS: During ""Phase 1"", many people faced several negative changes in lifestyle/eating behaviours with potential negative impact on health.

CVD biomarkers have, thus, great potential to be used as prognostic biomarkers. We aimed to determine the accuracy of CVD biomarkers for the prognosis of the COVID-19 patient’s outcome via a diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) meta-analysis. Methods: Until September 30, 2020, we searched Web of Sciences, Scopus, and MEDLINE/PubMed databases to obtain related papers. The summary points and lines were calculated using bivariate/HSROC model. As outcomes, we considered critical conditions and mortality. Results: A total of 17 659 patients from 33 studies were included. Five biomarkers, namely increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase (CK), D-dimer, and thrombocytopenia, met the inclusion criteria. Our results indicated that LDH and cTnI had good accuracy for the prognosis of critical condition (AUCHSROC=0.83 and 0.80, respectively), while LDH, cTnI, and D-dimer had acceptable accuracy (AUCHSROC=0.74, 0.71, and 0.72, respectively) for the prognosis of mortality. LDH and D-dimer had high sensitivity, whereas cTnI had high specificity. The other biomarkers did not have acceptable accuracy. Significant publication bias was found for D-dimer (P=0.053). Conclusion: Among CVD biomarkers, LDH and cTnI had good accuracy for the prognosis of critical outcomes and acceptable accuracy for the prognosis of mortality, without publication bias.

Indeed, the first step in viral entry is the binding of the viral trimeric spike protein to ACE2. Abundantly present in human epithelial cells of many organs, ACE2 is also expressed in the human brain. ACE2 is a type I membrane protein with an extracellular N-terminal peptidase domain and a C-terminal collectrin-like domain that ends with a single transmembrane helix and an intracellular 44-residues segment. This C-terminal segment contains a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) targeting protein interacting domains called PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ). Here, we identified the human PDZ specificity profile of the ACE2 PBM using the high throughput holdup assay and measuring the binding intensities of the PBM of ACE2 against the full human PDZome. We discovered 14 human PDZ binders of ACE2 showing significant binding with dissociation constants values ranging from 3 to 81 M. NHERF, SHANK, and SNX27 proteins found in this study are involved in protein trafficking. The PDZ/PBM interactions with ACE2 could play a role on ACE2 internalization and recycling that could benefit for the virus entry. Interestingly, most of the ACE2 partners we identified are expressed in neuronal cells, such as SHANK and MAST families, and modifications of the interactions between ACE2 and these neuronal proteins may be involved in neurological symptoms of COVID-19.","Caillet-Saguy, Célia; Wolff, Nicolas",,117,24

Glycogen synthase kinase-3ß (GSK-3ß) is a key protein kinase implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Blockade of GSK-3ß is an attractive therapeutic strategy for AD. Isoorientin, a 6-C-glycosylflavone, was previously shown to be a highly selective inhibitor of GSK-3ß, while exerting neuroprotective effects in neuronal models of AD. In the present study, we evaluated the in vivo effects of isoorientin on GSK-3ß, tau phosphorylation, Aß deposition, neuroinflammatory response, long-term potentiation, and spatial memory in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice using biochemical, electrophysiological, and behavioral tests. Chronic oral administration of isoorientin to APP/PS1 mice at 8 months of age attenuated multiple AD pathogenic hallmarks in the brains, including GSK-3ß overactivation, tau hyperphosphorylation, Aß deposition, and neuroinflammation. For neuroinflammation, isoorientin treatment reduced the number of activated microglia associated with Aß-positive plaques, and in parallel reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory factors in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. Strikingly, isoorientin reversed deficits in synaptic long-term potentiation and spatial memory relevant to cognitive functions. Together, the findings suggest that isoorientin is a brain neuroprotector and may be a promising drug lead for treatment of AD and related neurodegenerative disorders.","Tan, Xiaoqin; Liang, Zhibin; Li, Yingui; Zhi, Yingkun; Yi, Lang; Bai, Shasha; Forest, Kelly H; Nichols, Robert A; Dong, Yan; Li, Qing X",Behav Brain Res,117,16

SARS, MERS, Ebola, Nipah and an array of arenavirus infections sporadically spillover into human populations and are often contained only as a result of their poor transmission in human hosts, coupled with intense public health control efforts in the early stages of an emerging epidemic. It is now more apparent than ever that we need a better and more proactive approach. One possibility is to eliminate the threat of spillover before it occurs using vaccines capable of autonomously spreading through wild animal reservoirs. We are now poised to begin developing self-disseminating vaccines targeting a wide range of human pathogens, but important decisions remain about how they can be most effectively designed and used to target pathogens with a high risk of spillover and/or emergence. In this Perspective, we first review the basic epidemiological theory establishing the feasibility and utility of self-disseminating vaccines. We then outline a road map for overcoming remaining technical challenges: identifying high-risk pathogens before they emerge, optimizing vaccine design with an eye to evolution, behaviour and epidemiology, and minimizing the risk of unintended consequences.","Nuismer, Scott L; Bull, James J",Nat Ecol Evol,117,1

The purpose of this study was to quantify the prevalence of known risk factors associated with mortality due to COVID-19 for persons who have had a non-fatal overdose during 2015-2017 in comparison to persons who have not had an overdose. METHODS: Data were extracted from the BC Provincial Overdose Cohort which includes a 20 % random sample of BC residents and persons who have had a non-fatal overdose in BC from January 2015 to December 2017. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to compare risk factors by overdose history. RESULTS: Persons who had a non-fatal overdose were significantly more likely to have three (chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, coronary heart disease) of the four known chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19 compared to persons who did not have a previous non-fatal overdose event. CONCLUSION: Persons who had an overdose were more likely to have several chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19. The increased likelihood of having these risk factors is reflective of the social and health inequities experienced by persons who have a history of overdose.","Slaunwhite, Amanda Kathleen; Gan, Wen Qi; Xavier, Chloe; Zhao, Bin; Buxton, Jane A; Desai, Roshni",Drug Alcohol Depend,117,12

We observed a distinctive dual peak pattern of influenza epidemic during the A/H1N1 2009pdm in Beijing, China, which was formed by the A/H1N1 2009pdm, and a subsequent influenza B epidemic in year 2009/2010. Our analysis also shows a small peak formed by a seasonal H3N2 epidemic prior to the A/H1N1 2009pdm peak. Parallel detection of multiple respiratory viruses shows that the epidemic of common respiratory viruses, except human rhinovirus, was delayed during the pandemic of the A/H1N1 2009pdm. The H1N1 2009pdm mainly caused upper respiratory tract infections in the sampled patients; patients infected with H1N1 2009pdm had a higher percentage of cough than those infected with seasonal influenza or other respiratory viruses. Our findings indicate that A/H1N1 2009pdm and other respiratory viruses except human rhinovirus could interfere with each other during their transmission between human beings.

This virus has a broad spectrum of presentation that may overlap with Kawasaki disease in terms of presenting symptoms and laboratory and cardiac findings. Our objective was to review and summarise published evidence regarding the most important aspects of PIMS-TS, with special emphasis on the treatment strategies suggested for middle-income and low-income countries. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed in the principal medical databases including PubMed, Embase (OVID) and Google Scholar between December 2019 and August 2020. RESULTS: A total of 69 articles were identified in the described databases. Altogether, 13 articles met the inclusion criteria and were eligible. The most frequently described symptoms of PIMS-TS include fever (82%), shock (67%) and gastrointestinal (87%), skin (71%) and cardiac disorders (75%). In most series, it has been observed between 4 and 6 weeks after the pandemic appears in the general population. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is presented as a great systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which sometimes presents as shock requiring fluid resuscitation and vasoactive drug support (26%). Several treatment strategies have been used, including immunoglobulin, steroids, aspirin, anakinra and anticoagulation among others. These general and specific interventions should be guided by an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary team, especially in settings with limited resources. CONCLUSIONS: PIMS-TS COVID-19 is a new type of presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an exaggerated inflammatory response and frequent—but not exclusive—digestive and myocardial involvement. It is important to describe the clinical course and outcomes in countries with limited resources as well as establish the role of biomarkers for early diagnosis, effective therapeutic strategies and outpatient follow-up schemes.","Fernández-Sarmiento, Jaime; De Souza, Daniela; Jabornisky, Roberto; Gonzalez, Gustavo Ariel; Arias López, Maria del Pilar; Palacio, Gladys",BMJ Paediatr Open,117,3

A Critical Sociology Perspective,20.475563,0.75270617,2020-09-24,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is currently unknown whether immunosuppressive drugs are advantageous or detrimental in patients with COVID-19. Immunosuppressive drugs could be harmful in the initial phase of COVID-19. In this phase, the host immune response is necessary to inhibit viral replication. However, immunosuppressive drugs might have a beneficial effect in the later, more severe phase of COVID-19. In this phase, an overshoot of the host immune response (the “cytokine storm”) can cause ARDS, multiorgan failure and mortality. AIM: To summarize the available evidence on the effect of immunosuppressive drugs on infection with SARS-CoV-2. The effects of immunosuppressive drugs on similar pandemic coronaviruses may resemble the effects on SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we also included studies on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) METHODS: The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (registration number CRD42020181137). We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies with a control group and case-control studies concerning humans ≥ 18 years old. We also included in-vitro studies and animal studies with a control group. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Sixty-nine studies were included. Interestingly, MPA inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in-vitro. Clinical studies are needed to confirm the inhibitory effect of MPA on SARS-CoV-2 replication in-vivo. There are indications that corticosteroids and IL-6 inhibitors, like tocilizumab, can reduce mortality and prevent mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19. However, observational studies have contradictory results and the risk of bias is high. Thus, these results have to be confirmed in high-quality clinical trials before these drugs can be implemented as standard care. Based on the positive results of CNIs, mTOR inhibitors and thiopurine analogues in in-vitro studies with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it would be interesting to investigate their effects on SARS-CoV-2 replication.","Schoot, Tessa S.; Kerckhoffs, Angèle P.

Telehealth (online videoconferencing) interventions may be able to address the gap in tailored, evidence-based supportive interventions. We evaluated an online, group-based, videoconference-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention (‘Recapture Life’) in a randomized trial. Forty cancer survivors between the ages of 15–25 years participated. No positive impacts on participants’ quality of life emerged immediately following the intervention, but Recapture Life participants reported using more adaptive coping skills. Recapture Life participants also reported higher negative impact of cancer, anxiety and depression at a 12-month follow-up. Additional analyses suggested that survivors benefitted differently from the two online interventions (Recapture Life vs. peer-support group) depending on how recently they had completed their cancer treatment. Our data highlight that different survivor sub-groups may find group-based, telehealth psychological interventions more or less helpful at different points in survivorship. ABSTRACT: Telehealth interventions offer a practical platform to support adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors’ mental health needs after treatment, yet efficacy data are lacking. We evaluated an online, group-based, videoconferencing-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention (‘Recapture Life’) in a 3-arm randomized-controlled trial comparing Recapture Life with an online peer-support group, and a waitlist control, with the aim of testing its impact on quality of life, emotional distress and healthcare service use. Forty AYAs (M(age) = 20.6 years) within 24-months of completing treatment participated, together with 18 support persons. No groupwise impacts were measured immediately after the six-week intervention. However, Recapture Life participants reported using more CBT skills at the six-week follow-up (OR = 5.58, 95% CI = 2.00–15.56, p = 0.001) than peer-support controls. Recapture Life participants reported higher perceived negative impact of cancer, anxiety and depression at 12-month follow-up, compared to peer-support controls. Post-hoc analyses suggested that AYAs who were further from completing cancer treatment responded better to Recapture Life than those who had completed treatment more recently. While online telehealth interventions hold promise, recruitment to this trial was challenging. As the psychological challenges of cancer survivorship are likely to evolve with time, different support models may prove more or less helpful for different sub-groups of AYA survivors at different times.","Sansom-Daly, Ursula M.; Wakefield, Claire E.; Ellis, Sarah J.; McGill, Brittany C.; Donoghoe, Mark W.; Butow, Phyllis; Bryant, Richard A.; Sawyer, Susan M.; Patterson, Pandora; Anazodo, Antoinette; Plaster, Megan; Thompson, Kate; Holland, Lucy; Osborn, Michael; Maguire, Fiona; O’Dwyer, Catherine; De Abreu Lourenco, Richard; Cohn, Richard J.",Cancers (Basel),117,8

Development of antivirals against coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for COVID-19, is essential for containing the current and future coronavirus outbreaks. SARS-CoV-2 proteases represent important targets for the development of antivirals because of their role in the processing of viral polyproteins. 3-Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) is one such protease. The cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins by 3CLpro is facilitated by a Cys145–His41 catalytic dyad. We here characterized the catalytic roles of the cysteine–histidine pair for improved understanding of the 3CLpro reaction mechanism, to inform the development of more effective antivirals against Sars-CoV-2. The catalytic dyad residues were substituted by site-directed mutagenesis. All substitutions tested (H41A, H41D, H41E, C145A, and C145S) resulted in a complete inactivation of 3CLpro, even when amino acids with a similar catalytic function to that of the original residues were used. The integrity of the structural fold of enzyme variants was investigated by circular dichroism spectroscopy to test if the catalytic inactivation of 3CLpro was caused by gross changes in the enzyme secondary structure. C145A, but not the other substitutions, shifted the oligomeric state of the enzyme from dimeric to a higher oligomeric state. Finally, the thermodynamic stability of 3CLpro H41A, H41D, and C145S variants was reduced relative the wild-type enzyme, with a similar stability of the H41E and C145A variants. Collectively, the above observations confirm the roles of His41 and Cys145 in the catalytic activity and the overall conformational fold of 3CLpro SARS-CoV-2. We conclude that the cysteine–histidine pair should be targeted for inhibition of 3CLpro and development of antiviral against COVID-19 and coronaviruses.","Ferreira, Juliana C.; Fadl, Samar; Villanueva, Adrian J.; Rabeh, Wael M.",Front Chem,117,16

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the association of initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis in critically ill COVID-19 patients and the risk of death, thromboembolism, and bleeding. Method: All critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to two intensive care units in March and April 2020 were eligible. Patients were categorized into three groups according to initial daily dose of thromboprophylaxis: low (2500-4500 IU tinzaparin or 2500-5000 IU dalteparin), medium (>4500 IU but <175 IU/kilogram, kg, of body weight tinzaparin or >5000 IU but <200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin), and high dose ([≥] 175 IU/kg of body weight tinzaparin or [≥]200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin). Thromboprophylaxis dosage was based on local standardized recommendations, not on degree of critical illness or risk of thrombosis. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals of death within 28 days from ICU admission. Multivariable models were adjusted for sex, age, body-mass index, Simplified Acute Physiology Score III, invasive respiratory support, and initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis. Results: A total of 152 patients were included; 67 received low, 48 medium, and 37 high dose thromboprophylaxis. Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. Mortality was lower in high (13.5%) vs medium (25.0%) and low dose thromboprophylaxis (38.8%) groups, p{equiv}0.02. The hazard ratio of death was 0.33 (95% confidence intervals 0.13 - 0.87) among those who received high dose, respectively 0.88 (95% confidence intervals 0.43 - 1.83) among those who received medium dose, as compared with those who received low dose thromboprophylaxis. There were fewer thromboembolic events in the high (2.7%) vs medium (18.8%) and low dose thromboprophylaxis (17.9%) groups, p{equiv}0.04, but no difference in the proportion of bleeding events, p{equiv}0.16.

Conventional detection methods may be misleading and do not provide rapid results allowing for immediate action. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method has proven to be an effective tool to detect and quantify microorganisms in water within a few hours. Quantitative PCR assays have recently been developed for the detection of specific adeno- and polyomaviruses, bacteria and protozoa in different water sources. The technique is highly sensitive and able to detect low numbers of microorganisms. Quantitative PCR can be applied for microbial source tracking in water sources, to determine the efficiency of water and wastewater treatment plants and act as a tool for risk assessment. Different qPCR assays exist depending on whether an internal control is used or whether measurements are taken at the end of the PCR reaction (end-point qPCR) or in the exponential phase (real-time qPCR). Fluorescent probes are used in the PCR reaction to hybridise within the target sequence to generate a signal and, together with specialised systems, quantify the amount of PCR product. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (q-RT-PCR) is a more sensitive technique that detects low copy number RNA and can be applied to detect, e.g. enteric viruses and viable microorganisms in water, and measure specific gene expression. There is, however, a need to standardise qPCR protocols if this technique is to be used as an analytical diagnostic tool for routine monitoring. This review focuses on the application of qPCR in the detection of microorganisms in water.","Botes, Marelize; de Kwaadsteniet, Michéle; Cloete, Thomas Eugene",Anal Bioanal Chem,117,10

CASE-FINDING METHODS: We report a patient from Panama with SARS-CoV-2 infection complicated by ATM and present a comprehensive clinical review of 43 patients with COVID-19-associated ATM from 21 countries published from March 2020 to January 2021. In addition, 3 cases of ATM were reported as serious adverse events during the clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222). RESULTS: All patients had typical features of ATM with acute onset of paralysis, sensory level and sphincter deficits due to spinal cord lesions demonstrated by imaging. There were 23 males (53%) and 20 females (47%) ranging from ages 21- to 73- years-old (mean age, 49 years), with two peaks at 29 and 58 years, excluding 3 pediatric cases. The main clinical manifestations were quadriplegia (58%) and paraplegia (42%). MRI reports were available in 40 patients; localized ATM lesions affected ≤3 cord segments (12 cases, 30%) at cervical (5 cases) and thoracic cord levels (7 cases); 28 cases (70%) had longitudinally-extensive ATM (LEATM) involving ≥4 spinal cord segments (cervicothoracic in 18 cases and thoracolumbar-sacral in 10 patients). Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) occurred in 8 patients, mainly women (67%) ranging from 27- to 64-years-old. Three ATM patients also had blindness from myeloneuritis optica (MNO) and two more also had acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN). CONCLUSIONS: We found ATM to be an unexpectedly frequent neurological complication of COVID-19. Most cases (68%) had a latency of 10 days to 6 weeks that may indicate post-infectious neurological complications mediated by the host’s response to the virus. In 32% a brief latency (15 hours to 5 days) suggested a direct neurotropic effect of SARS-CoV-2. The occurrence of 3 reported ATM adverse effects among 11,636 participants in the AZD1222 vaccine trials is extremely high considering a worldwide incidence of 0.5/million COVID-19-associated ATM cases found in this report. The pathogenesis of ATM remains unknown, but it is conceivable that SARS-CoV-2 antigens –perhaps also present in the AZD1222 COVID-19 vaccine or its chimpanzee adenovirus adjuvant– may induce immune mechanisms leading to the myelitis.","Román, Gustavo C.; Gracia, Fernando; Torres, Antonio; Palacios, Alexis; Gracia, Karla; Harris, Diógenes",Front Immunol,117,1

The genome sequence of COVID-19 opened the opportunity for multiple in vitro and clinical trials, but we still do not have a clear path to treatment. Chlorpheniramine maleate (CPM) is a safe and effective antihistamine with potent antiviral activity against various strains of influenza A/B, thus suggesting that CPM has broad antiviral activity. We tested the virucidal potential of CPM in a nasal spray composition currently in development as an anti-allergy medication. Methods The virucidal activity of CPM was tested using viral stock of SARS-CoV-2, USA-WA1/2020 strain in Vero 76 infected cells. The endpoint titer 50% cell culture infection dose (CCID(50)) values were calculated using the Reed-Muench (1948) equation. Three independent replicates of each sample were tested, and the average and standard deviation were calculated. Results were compared with untreated controls using one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test in GraphPad Prism (version 8) software. Results After 25 minutes of contact time, the nasal spray reduced the levels of the virus from 4.2 to 1.7 log10 CCID(50) per 0.1 mL, a statistically significant 2.5 log reduction value or 99.7% reduction in the viral load. Conclusions This study demonstrates the strong virucidal effect against SARS-CoV-2 of a nasal spray containing CPM. Given that CPM has broad antiviral effects against influenza and virucidal effect against SARS-CoV-2, we propose two further studies: a randomized placebo-controlled study of intranasally delivered chlorpheniramine in patients with mild-to-moderate SARS-CoV-2 and a second study aiming to determine the potential antiviral and adjuvant effects of CPM plus hydroxychloroquine, versus hydroxychloroquine alone, in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2.","Westover, Jonna B; Ferrer, Gustavo; Vazquez, Hector; Bethencourt-Mirabal, Arian; Go, Camille Celeste",Cureus,117,10

The report made several recommendations relevant to general practice. METHOD: In order to facilitate implementation of these recommendations, an online survey was designed to explore United Kingdom general practitioner (GP) experiences, opinions, knowledge and needs in relation to depression, ADs and withdrawal. A total of 66 GPs had completed the survey when COVID-19 occurred. RESULTS: In keeping with previous findings, this small sample of GPs had a predominantly psycho-social perspective on the causes of, and treatments for, depression. They broadly considered ADs effective for moderate/severe depression and ineffective for minimal/mild depression, for which they preferred psychological therapies and social prescribing. There was a marked lack of consistency in GPs’ knowledge about the incidence and duration of withdrawal effects. Only a minority (29%) felt their knowledge about withdrawal was ‘adequate’ and fewer (17%) believed this about their ‘Ability to distinguish between withdrawal effects and return of the original problem (e.g. depression)’. Two-thirds (68%) would like more training on these matters. CONCLUSION: It is hoped that even this small sample will be helpful when designing, and seeking funding for, GP training programmes, and when implementing the PHE recommendations for support services, based in the primary care system, for the millions of people contemplating or initiating withdrawal from ADs every year in the UK.","Read, John; Renton, Julia; Harrop, Christopher; Geekie, Jim; Dowrick, Christopher",Ther Adv Psychopharmacol,117,5

Meanwhile ATP is a crucial indicator for cellular energy status and viability, thus a vital variable for tissue regeneration and in vitro tissue engineering. Most recent studies on COVID-19 virus suggest infection caused ATP deficit and release as a major characterization at the early stage of the disease and major causes for disease complications. Thus, imaging ATP molecule in both cellular and extracellular contexts has many applications in biology, engineering, and clinics. A sensitive and selective fluorescence “signal-on” probe for ATP detection was constructed, based on the base recognition between a black hole quencher (BHQ)-labeled aptamer oligonucleotide and a fluorophore (Cy5)-labeled reporter flare. The probe was able to detect ATP in solution with single digit µM detection limit. With the assistance of lipofectamine, this probe efficiently entered and shined in the model cells U2OS within 3 h. Further application of the probe in specific scenery, cardio-tissue engineering, was also tested where the ATP aptamer complex was able to sense cellular ATP status in a semi-quantitative manner, representing a novel approach for selection of functional cardiomyocytes for tissue engineering. At last a slight change in probe configuration in which a flexible intermolecular A14 linker was introduced granted regeneration capability. These data support the application of this probe in multiple circumstances where ATP measurement or imaging is on demand.

Sera are then supplemented with soluble ACE2-Fc to compete for RBD-binding serum antibodies, and antibody binding quantified. Comparison of signal from untreated serum and ACE2-Fc-treated serum reveals the presence of antibodies that compete with ACE2 for RBD binding, as evidenced by loss of signal with ACE2-Fc treatment. In our test cohort of nine convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients, we found all patients had developed anti-RBD antibodies targeting the epitope responsible for ACE2 engagement. This assay provides a simple and high-throughput method to screen patient sera for potentially neutralizing anti-Spike antibodies to enable identification of candidate sera for therapeutic use.","Byrnes, James R.; Zhou, Xin X.; Lui, Irene; Elledge, Susanna K.; Glasgow, Jeff E.; Lim, Shion A.; Loudermilk, Rita; Chiu, Charles Y.; Wilson, Michael R.; Leung, Kevin K.; Wells, James A.",medRxiv,117,22

Daily intravenous infusions of HBOC (1.95, 3.90, or 5.85 g/kg/day) during gestational days (GDs) 6–18 in Sprague-Dawley rats caused fetal mortality, reduced birth weight, and malformations. Subsequent single-day infusions (5.85 g/kg/day) showed that developmental toxicity was limited to GDs 7–9 when histiotrophic nutrition via the inverted visceral yolk sac (invVYS) is essential. Histiotrophic nutrition is receptor-mediated endocytosis of bulk maternal proteins and subsequent lysosomal degradation providing amino acids and other nutrients for embryonic growth. Controls for protein content, oncotic properties, and hemoglobin content indicated that toxicity was due to hemoglobin. Rat whole embryo cultures verified HBOC interference with invVYS transport capacity and resultant deficient embryonic nutrition. These mechanisms of action are not expected to impact human development based on differences in VYS morphology and function, although a complete understanding of early human embryonic nutrition is lacking.","Stump, D.G.; Holson, J.F.; Harris, C.; Pearce, L.B.; Watson, R.E.; DeSesso, J.M.",Reprod Toxicol,117,24

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with meta-regression of studies reporting B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) plasma concentrations in COVID-19. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, between January 2020 and 2021, for studies reporting BNP/NT-proBNP concentrations, measures of COVID-19 severity, and survival status (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021239190). Forty-four studies in 18,856 COVID-19 patients were included in the meta-analysis and meta-regression. In pooled results, BNP/NT-proBNP concentrations were significantly higher in patients with high severity or non-survivor status when compared to patients with low severity or survivor status during follow up (SMD = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.89–1.24, and p < 0.001). We observed extreme between-study heterogeneity (I(2) = 93.9%, p < 0.001). In sensitivity analysis, the magnitude and the direction of the effect size were not substantially modified after sequentially removing individual studies and re-assessing the pooled estimates, (effect size range, 0.99 – 1.10). No publication bias was observed with the Begg's (p = 0.26) and Egger's (p = 0.40) t-tests.

In this study, we aim to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA by real time one-step reverse transcriptase PCR on banknotes being circulating in Bangladesh. We also assessed the persistence of the virus on banknotes spiked with SARS-CoV-2 positive diluted human nasopharyngeal samples. Among the 425 banknote samples collected from different entities, 7.29% (n= 31) were tested positive for targeted genes. Twenty four representative positive samples were assessed for N gene fragments by conventional PCR and sequenced. All the samples carry viral RNA belonged to GR clade, the predominant circulating clade in Bangladesh. In the test of stability, the N gene was detected for up to 72 h on banknotes spiked with nasopharyngeal samples and CT values increases significantly with time (p<0.05). ORF1b gene was observed to be less stable specially on old banknotes and usually went beyond detectable limit within 8 to 10 h. The stability of virus RNA was well fitted by Weibull model and concave curve for new banknotes and convex curve for old banknotes have been revealed. Handling of banknotes is unavoidable; hence these findings implicated that in order to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission through banknotes proper hygiene practice are needed.","Akter, S.; Roy, P.

In a systematic analysis we identified 142 datasets with information on severity of disease by age for 32 different infectious diseases, 19 viral and 13 bacterial. For almost all infections, school-age children have the least severe disease, and severity starts to rise long before old age. Indeed, for many infections even young adults have more severe disease than children, and dengue was the only infection that was most severe in school-age children. Together with data on vaccine response in children and young adults, the findings suggest peak immune function is reached around 5–14 years of age. Relative immune senescence may begin much earlier than assumed, before accelerating in older age groups. This has major implications for understanding resilience to infection, optimal vaccine scheduling, and appropriate health protection policies across the life course.","Glynn, Judith R.; Moss, Paul A.

Findings are based on qualitative research consisting of semi-structured interviews with industry leaders from assorted sectors. Tourism in Penang emerges as vulnerable to regional and global events which act as a trigger for tourism crises, demanding a response in which various strategies are employed. The destination is also seen to recover fairly quickly from experiences of crises, but a well designed and formulated tourism crisis management plan under the stewardship of the public sector is necessary to mitigate further damage in the future.","Ghaderi, Zahed; Mat Som, Ahmad Puad; Henderson, Joan C.",Tour Manag Perspect,117,22

This study examines the changes in stroke epidemiology and care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Zanjan Province, Iran. METHODS: This study is part of the CASCADE international initiative. From February 18, 2019, to July 18, 2020, we followed ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke hospitalization rates and outcomes in Valiasr Hospital, Zanjan, Iran. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model and an interrupted time series analysis (ITS) to identify changes in stroke hospitalization rate, baseline stroke severity [measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)], disability [measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS)], presentation time (last seen normal to hospital presentation), thrombolytic therapy rate, median door-to-needle time, length of hospital stay, and in-hospital mortality. We compared in-hospital mortality between study periods using Cox-regression model. RESULTS: During the study period, 1,026 stroke patients were hospitalized. Stroke hospitalization rates per 100,000 population decreased from 68.09 before the pandemic to 44.50 during the pandemic, with a significant decline in both Bayesian [Beta: -1.034; Standard Error (SE): 0.22, 95% CrI: -1.48, -0.59] and ITS analysis (estimate: -1.03, SE=0.24, P <0.0001). Furthermore, we observed lower admission rates for patients with mild (NIHSS<5) ischemic stroke (P<0.0001). Although, the presentation time and door-to-needle time did not change during the pandemic, a lower proportion of patients received thrombolysis (-10.1%; P=0.004). We did not see significant changes in admission rate to the stroke unit and in-hospital mortality rate; however, disability at discharge increased (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: In Zanjan, Iran, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted stroke outcomes and altered the delivery of stroke care. Observed lower admission rates for milder stroke may possibly be due to fear of exposure related to COVID-19. The decrease in patients treated with thrombolysis and the increased disability at discharge may indicate changes in the delivery of stroke care and increased pressure on existing stroke acute and subacute services. The results of this research will contribute to a similar analysis of the larger CASCADE dataset in order to confirm findings at a global scale and improve measures to ensure the best quality of care for stroke patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ghoreishi, Abdoreza; Arsang-Jang, Shahram; Sabaa-Ayoun, Ziad; Yassi, Nawaf; Sylaja, P.N.; Akbari, Yama; Divani, Afshin A.; Biller, Jose; Phan, Thanh; Steinwender, Sandy; Silver, Brian; Zand, Ramin; Basri, Hamidon Bin; Iqbal, Omer M.; Ranta, Annemarei; Ruland, Sean; Macri, Elizabeth; Ma, Henry; Nguyen, Thanh N.; Abootalebi, Shahram; Gupta, Animesh; Alet, Matias; Lattazani, Simona; Desai, Masoom; Gagliardi, Rubens J.; Girotra, Tarun; Inoue, Manabu; Yoshimoto, Takeshi; Isaac, Cristian Flavo; Mayer, Stephan A.; Morovatdar, Negar; Nilanont, Yongchai; Nobleza, Christa O'Hana S.; Saber, Hamidreza; Kamenova, Saltanat; Kondybayeva, Aida; Krupinski, Jerzy; Siegler, James E.; Stranges, Saverio; Torbey, Michel T.; Yorio, Diana; Zurrú, María Cristina; Rubinos, Clio Aracelli; Shahripour, Reza Bavarsad; Borhani-Haghighi, Afshin; Napoli, Mario Di; Azarpazhooh, M.

Ebolavirus is suspected to have caused recent declines in resident great apes. While ebolavirus vaccines have been proposed as an intervention to protect apes, their effectiveness would be improved if we could diagnostically confirm Ebola virus disease (EVD) as the cause of die-offs, establish ebolavirus geographical distribution, identify immunologically naïve populations, and determine whether apes survive virus exposure. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report the first successful noninvasive detection of antibodies against Ebola virus (EBOV) from wild ape feces. Using this method, we have been able to identify gorillas with antibodies to EBOV with an overall prevalence rate reaching 10% on average, demonstrating that EBOV exposure or infection is not uniformly lethal in this species. Furthermore, evidence of antibodies was identified in gorillas thought previously to be unexposed to EBOV (protected from exposure by rivers as topological barriers of transmission). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our new approach will contribute to a strategy to protect apes from future EBOV infections by early detection of increased incidence of exposure, by identifying immunologically naïve at-risk populations as potential targets for vaccination, and by providing a means to track vaccine efficacy if such intervention is deemed appropriate. Finally, since human EVD is linked to contact with infected wildlife carcasses, efforts aimed at identifying great ape outbreaks could have a profound impact on public health in local communities, where EBOV causes case-fatality rates of up to 88%.","Reed, Patricia E.; Mulangu, Sabue; Cameron, Kenneth N.; Ondzie, Alain U.; Joly, Damien; Bermejo, Magdalena; Rouquet, Pierre; Fabozzi, Giulia; Bailey, Michael; Shen, Zhimin; Keele, Brandon F.; Hahn, Beatrice; Karesh, William B.; Sullivan, Nancy J.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,117,1

After the confirmation of the first imported cases, the lack of a proper airport entrance control resulted in the infection spreading in a manner directly proportional to the amount of flights reaching each city, following first occurrence of the virus coming from abroad. Methodology. We developed a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model divided in a metapopulation structure, where cities with airports were demes connected by the number of flights. Subsequently, we further explored the role of Manaus airport for a rapid entrance of the pandemic into indigenous territories situated in remote places of the Amazon region. Results. The expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus between cities was fast, directly proportional to the airport closeness centrality within the Brazilian air transportation network. There was a clear pattern in the expansion of the pandemic, with a stiff exponential expansion of cases for all cities. The more an airport showed closeness centrality, the greater was its vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions. We discussed the weak pandemic control performance of Brazil in comparison with other tropical, developing countries, namely India and Nigeria.

Thus, medical diagnosis is not accurate. Although several clinical diagnostic methodologies have been introduced hitherto, chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging techniques complement the analytical methods (for instance, RT-PCR) to a certain extent. In this context, we demonstrate a novel framework by employing various image segmentation models to leverage the available image databases (9000 chest X-ray images and 6000 CT scan images). The proposed methodology is expected to assist in the prognosis of Covid-19-infected individuals through examination of chest X-rays and CT scans of images using the Deep Covix-Net model for identifying novel coronavirus-infected patients effectively and efficiently. The slice of the precision score is analysed in terms of performance metrics such as accuracy, the confusion matrix, and the receiver operating characteristic curve. The result leans on the database obtainable in the GitHub and Kaggle repository, conforming to their endorsed chest X-ray and CT images. The classification performances of various algorithms were examined for a test set with 1800 images. The proposed model achieved a 96.8% multiple-classification accuracy among Covid-19, normal, and pneumonia chest X-ray databases. Moreover, it attained a 97% accuracy among Covid-19 and normal CT scan images. Thus, the proposed mechanism achieves the rigorousness associated with the machine learning technique, providing rapid outcomes for both training and testing datasets.","Vinod, Dasari Naga; Jeyavadhanam, B.

An efficient way to improve this disease's clinical management would be to characterize patients at higher risk of progressing to critically severe infection using prognostic biomarkers. The telomere length could be used for this purpose. Telomeres are responsible for controlling the number of maximum cell divisions. The telomere length is a biomarker of aging and several diseases. We aimed to compare leukocyte telomere length (LTL) between patients without COVID-19 and patients with different clinical severity of the infection. Were included 53 patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR divided in four groups. The first group was composed by patients with a negative diagnosis for COVID-19 (n = 12). The other three groups consisted of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 divided according to the severity of the disease: mild (n = 15), moderate (n = 17) and severe (n = 9). The LTL was determined by Q-PCR. The severe group had the shortest LTL, followed by the moderate group. The negative and mild groups showed no differences. There is an increase of patients with hypertension (p = 0.0099) and diabetes (p = 0.0067) in moderate and severe groups. Severe group was composed by older patients in comparison with the other three groups (p = 0.0083). Regarding sex, there was no significant difference between groups (p = 0.6279).

In spite of proper vaccinations against the IBV, new IBV strains are continually emerging worldwide. In this study, a new highly virulent nephropathogenic IBV strain named CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 was identified from a vaccinated flock with clinical signs of IB in the Jiangsu province of China. The full-length genome sequence of the isolate was 27,714 nucleotides long, and the genome was organized similarly to classical IBV strains. Minimum divergence, phylogenetic analysis, and distance matrix of the genome showed that the CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 isolate had the highest similarity to the IBV BJ strain. The spike glycoprotein (S) gene had the greatest similarity to the nephropathogenic BJ strain and showed an 8 amino acid insertion (YSNGNSDV) at 73 to 80 sites and 3 amino acid deletion at sites 126 to 128 compared to the IBV vaccine strains. A recombination analysis of the S gene showed that the new isolate evolved from the IBV BJ strain and the KM91 vaccine strain. An animal challenge experiment showed a mortality of 60 to 80% in early-age chickens by different inoculation routes. Pathological examinations of the kidneys revealed inflammation, distention with uric acid deposits, and tubular degeneration. It indicated that the CK/CH/XDC-2/2013 isolate has robust kidney tissue tropism, and new nephropathogenic IBV strains are continuously evolving in China.","Leghari, R.A.; Fan, B.; Wang, H.; Bai, J.; Zhang, L.; Abro, S.H.; Jiang, P.",Poult Sci,117,16

Participants reported that cancer prevention was vague to them early in training, impairing career exploration. Further, without role models and opportunities to learn about cancer prevention, many were ignorant of career options. Many had incorrect views about cancer prevention practice being mainly within the scope of primary care physicians, and some reported colleagues viewing the rigor of cancer prevention skeptically. However, all described notable experiences—in classes, with mentors, on research projects, or from encounters with patients, motivating them to pursue academic clinical cancer prevention regardless of challenges. Clearly, a lack of both information and guidance towards careers in clinical cancer prevention has been critical barriers to robust recruitment of physicians to the field and must be addressed urgently.

METHODS This is a descriptive study carried out using the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance System (Sistema de Vigilância Epidemiológica da Gripe - SIVEP-Gripe) database. The rates of incidence, mortality, and accumulated incidence in the period were calculated, stratified by age group and Regional Health Department (RHD). In addition, severe cases were geocoded to analyze their spread across the state; and the Effective R, which determines the spread potential of a virus within a population, was calculated. RESULTS There was a significant increase in severe cases and deaths recorded in the period of one year, with incidence and mortality rates being heterogeneous within the state. The most critical periods regarding the incidence of severe cases occurred between May and July 2020 and between March and April 2021. The RHD in São José do Rio Preto, Expanded São Paulo, and Araçatuba concentrated the highest incidence and mortality rates. Severe cases and deaths were more frequent in men and in the population over 60 years, while the main risk conditions related to deaths were heart disease (59%) and diabetes (42,8%).

The results clarified the beginning of the cardiac sarcopenia at the age of 12 months, with hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes, increased expression of β-MHC, appearance of small necrotic fibers, decline of cadiomyocyte number, destruction of mitochondrial cristae, appearance of small-sized residual bodies, and increased apoptotic nuclei ratio. These changes were progressed in the cardiac myocytes of 24 old mice, accompanied by excessive collagen deposition, higher expressions of IL-1α, IL-6, and TNFα, complete mitochondrial vacuolation and damage, myofibrils disorganization, multivesicular bodies formation, and nuclear fragmentation. Interestingly, cardiac myocytes of NLRP3(−/−) mice showed less detectable age-related changes compared with WT mice. Oral melatonin therapy preserved the normal cardiomyocytes structure, restored cardiomyocytes number, and reduced β-MHC expression of cardiac hypertrophy. In addition, melatonin recovered mitochondrial architecture, reduced apoptosis and multivesicular bodies’ formation, and decreased expressions of β-MHC, IL-1α, and IL-6. Fewer cardiac sarcopenic changes and highly remarkable protective effects of melatonin treatment detected in aged cardiomyocytes of NLRP3(−/−) mice compared with aged WT animals, confirming implication of the NLRP3 inflammasome in cardiac aging.

Although several circulating biomarkers are thought to be related to COVID-19 severity, few studies have focused on the characteristics of critically ill patients with different outcomes. The objective of this study was to perform a longitudinal investigation of the potential mechanisms affecting the prognosis of critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In addition to clinical data, 113 whole blood samples and 85 serum samples were collected from 33 severe and critical COVID-19 patients without selected comorbidities. Multi-omics analysis was then performed using longitudinal samples. RESULTS: Obvious transcriptional transitions were more frequent in critical survivors than in critical non-survivors, indicating that phase transition may be related to survival. Based on analysis of differentially expressed genes during transition, the erythrocyte differentiation pathway was significantly enriched. Furthermore, clinical data indicated that red blood cell counts showed greater fluctuation in survivors than in non-survivors. Moreover, declining red blood cell counts and hemoglobin levels were validated as prognostic markers of poor outcome in an independent cohort of 114 critical COVID-19 patients. Protein–metabolite–lipid network analysis indicated that tryptophan metabolism and melatonin may contribute to molecular transitions in critical COVID-19 patients with different outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study systematically and comprehensively depicted the longitudinal hallmarks of critical COVID-19 patients and indicated that multi-omics transition may impact the prognosis. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Frequent transcriptional phase transitions may contribute to outcome in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, fluctuation in red blood cell and hemoglobin levels may relate to poor prognosis. The biological function of melatonin was suppressed in COVID-19 non-survivors, which may provide a potential theoretical basis for clinical administration.","Sun, Chaoyang; Sun, Yuzhe; Wu, Ping; Ding, Wencheng; Wang, Shiyou; Li, Jiafeng; Liang, Langchao; Chai, Chaochao; Fu, Yu; Li, Zhiming; Zhu, Linnan; Ju, Jia; Liao, Xin; Huang, Xiaoyuan; Feng, Ling; Ma, Ding; He, Liang; Chen, Dongsheng; Chen, Gang; Jin, Xin; Wu, Peng",Intensive Care Med Exp,117,6

Methods: From July to November 2017, a random selection of 600 community pharmacies were called requesting a pharmacist (n = 532, 88.7% response). Pharmacists were asked if they had heard of the new law, if they would dispense a year-long supply to cash-pay, privately or publicly insured patients, and what they perceived as obstacles to dispensing year-long supplies. Results: Awareness of this law was assessed through these surveys. Most pharmacists responded they would dispense year-long supplies to cash-pay patients, regardless of knowledge of the new law (81% of “knew”, 70% of “did not know”, p = 0.1046). The top two perceived obstacles were insurance reimbursement (55.8%) and store policy (13.4%). Conclusion: Despite a new law requiring insurance coverage of a year-long supply of prescription birth control, most pharmacists were unaware at six months after the policy went into effect. Of those who were aware, the majority did not clearly understand it. Compliance among insurance plans is unknown.

METHODS: Between June 22(nd) and August 15(th) 2020, HCW from institutions in Northern/Eastern Switzerland were screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We recorded baseline characteristics, non-occupational and occupational risk factors. We used pairwise tests of associations and multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with seropositivity. RESULTS: Among 4’664 HCW from 23 healthcare facilities, 139 (3%) were seropositive. Non-occupational exposures independently associated with seropositivity were contact with a COVID-19-positive household (adjusted OR=59, 95%-CI: 33-106), stay in a COVID-19 hotspot (aOR=2.3, 95%-CI: 1.2-4.2), and male sex (aOR=1.9, 95%-CI: 1.1-3.1).

Consumer-oriented health information technology may help mitigate lifestyle risk factors and improve chronic disease self-management. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the prevalence, patterns, and predictors of the use of the internet, digital devices, and apps for health purposes as well as preferences for future use of eHealth support in South Asian Canadians. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, mixed-mode survey in a convenience sample of 831 South Asian adults recruited at faith-based gathering places, health care settings, and community events in Edmonton, Alberta, in 2014. The 706 responders (mean age 47.1, SD 17.6 years; n=356, 50.4% female; n=509, 72.1% Sikh) who provided complete sociodemographic information were included in the analysis, and the denominators varied based on the completeness of responses to each question. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine sociodemographic and health status predictors of internet use, being a web-based health information seeker, smartphone or tablet ownership, health app use, and willingness to use various modes of eHealth support. RESULTS: Of all respondents, 74.6% (527/706) were internet users and 47.8% (336/703) were web-based health information seekers. In addition, 74.9% (527/704) of respondents owned a smartphone or tablet and 30.7% (159/518) of these had a health and fitness app. Most internet users (441/527, 83.7%) expressed interest in using ≥1 mode of eHealth support. Older age, being female, having less than high school education, preferring written health information in languages other than English, and lacking confidence in completing medical forms predicted lack of internet use. Among internet users, factors that predicted web-based health information seeking were being female, use of the internet several times per day, being confident in completing medical forms, and preferring health information in English. Predictors of not owning a smartphone or tablet were being older, preferring health information in languages other than English, having less than high school education, living in Canada for <5 years, having a chronic health condition, and having diabetes. Increasing age was associated with lower odds of having a health app. Preferring health information in languages other than English consistently predicted lower interest in all modes of eHealth support. CONCLUSIONS: eHealth-based chronic disease prevention and management interventions are feasible for South Asian adults, but digital divides exist according to language preference, education, age, sex, confidence in completing medical forms, and number of years lived in Canada. Community-based, culturally tailored strategies targeting these factors are required to address existing divides and increase the uptake of credible web-based and app-based resources for health purposes.","Makowsky, Mark J; Jones, Charlotte A; Davachi, Shahnaz",JMIR Public Health Surveill,117,12

METHODS: We launched a survey composed of 25 questions about how COVID-19 has changed the safety and organization of daily activity in Italian radiology units. RESULTS: A total of 2136/10,564 (20.2%) radiologists of the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology participated. Two-thirds performed at least one diagnostic/interventional procedure on COVID-19 patients. The 88.1% reported a reduction in the elective imaging volumes, with US, mammography, and MRI having shown the greater decrease (41.1%, 23.9%, and 21.1%, respectively). In 69.6% of cases, institutions had trouble getting personal protective equipment (PPE), especially public hospitals and southern institutions. Less than 30% of participants were subjected to RT-PCR swab test, although 81.5% believed that it should be done on all health workers and 70% suggested it as the most important measure to improve safety at work. Slightly more than half of participants declared to work safely and felt to be adequately protected by their institutions. Up to 20% of northern participants were redeployed to clinical services. The first imaging examination performed by admitted COVID-19 patients was chest radiography in 76.3% of cases. Almost half of participants reported that less than 30% of health workers were infected in their radiology department, with higher rates in northern regions and public institutions. CONCLUSIONS: This snapshot of the current situation in Italian radiology departments could be used to harmonize the organization of working activity in order to safely and effectively face this pandemic. KEY POINTS: • More than two-thirds of institutions had trouble getting PPE for health workers, with public hospitals and southern institutions that presented more procurement problems • A substantial drop of imaging volumes was observed in the vast majority of Italian radiology departments, mostly due to the decrease of ultrasound, mammography, and MRI, especially in private practice were working activity was stopped in 13.3% of institutions • RT-PCR swab to health workers was reported as the most suggested measure by Italian radiologists to improve safety at work, as more than 80% of them believed that it should be performed to all health workers, although less than 30% were subjected to this test ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1007/s00330-020-07046-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","Albano, Domenico; Bruno, Antonio; Bruno, Federico; Calandri, Marco; Caruso, Damiano; Clemente, Alfredo; Coppolino, Pietro; Cozzi, Diletta; De Robertis, Riccardo; Gentili, Francesco; Grazzini, Irene; Jannone, Maria Laura; Liguori, Carlo; Natella, Raffaele; Pace, Genny; Posa, Alessandro; Scalise, Paola; Accarino, Bruno; Bibbolino, Corrado; Barile, Antonio; Grassi, Roberto; Messina, Carmelo",Eur Radiol,117,20

However, Heinsberg was not included as an area reporting local or community transmission per the national case definition at the time. In early March, two residents from a long-term care facility (LTCF) in Sittard, a Dutch town located in close vicinity to the district of Heinsberg, tested positive for COVID-19. In this study we aimed to determine whether cross-border introduction of the virus took place by analysing the LTCF outbreak in Sittard, both epidemiologically and microbiologically. METHODS: Surveys and semi-structured oral interviews were conducted with all present LTCF residents by health care workers during regular points of care for information on new or unusual signs and symptoms of disease. Both throat and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from residents suspect of COVID-19, based on regional criteria, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction. Additionally, whole genome sequencing was performed using a SARS-CoV-2 specific amplicon-based Nanopore sequencing approach. Moreover, twelve random residents were sampled for possible asymptomatic infections. RESULTS: Out of 99 residents, 46 got tested for COVID-19. Out of the 46 tested residents, nineteen (41%) tested positive for COVID-19, including 3 asymptomatic residents. CT-values for asymptomatic residents seemed higher compared to symptomatic residents. Eleven samples were sequenced, along with three random samples from COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the regional hospital at the time of the LTCF outbreak. All samples were linked to COVID-19 cases from the cross-border region of Heinsberg, Germany. CONCLUSIONS: Sequencing combined with epidemiological data was able to virtually prove cross-border transmission at the start of the Dutch COVID-19 epidemic. Our results highlight the need for cross-border collaboration and adjustment of national policy to emerging region-specific needs along borders in order to establish coordinated implementation of infection control measures to limit the spread of COVID-19.

In the conditions mentioned, many people are on long-term treatment with agents including hydroxychloroquine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitor drugs, other biologic agents such as monoclonal antibodies to IL-6 and Janus kinase inhibitors including baricitinib and tofacitinib, which are used to control inflammatory responses in their respective auto-immune condition. There is emerging data that immunomodulatory drugs could be protective at reducing certain features of SARS-CoV-2 and improving recovery. In addition, it is important to understand if subjects being treated with the immunomodulatory agents described have a less severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, as they are deemed some protection from their immunomodulatory treatment, or if they develop infections similar to non-immunocompromised patients. There is a huge unmet clinical need to advise patients responsibly about whether they should remain on their immunomodulatory treatment or not in light of Covid-19 infection. In this article we will discuss potential treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 using immunomodulatory drugs and at what stage of the condition they may be beneficial.

We investigated the characteristics of a field strain of PEDV (PEDV strain SH) isolated from a piglet with severe diarrhea on a farm in Shanghai China. Whole genome sequencing and analysis revealed that the SH strain belonged to subtype G2b and has a unique 12-aa deletion (aa 399–410) including the antigenic epitope NEP-1C9 (aa 398–406) of the N protein. PEDV SH strain is highly pathogenic to challenged newborn piglets, resulting in 100 % morbidity and mortality. Pathological examination revealed significant villus atrophy in the jejuna of infected piglets. Mice inoculated with inactivated PEDV SH produced antibodies against the N protein, but no antibodies against the deletions. These results illustrated that deletion of the NEP-1C9 epitope had no effect on the immunogenicity or pathogenicity of PEDV, providing evidence of the necessity to monitor the genetic diversity of the virus. Our study also contributes to development of candidate for vaccines and diagnostics that could differentiate pigs seropositive due to vaccination by conventional strains from wild virus infection.","Wang, Xian-Wei; Wang, Mi; Zhan, Jing; Liu, Qian-Yu; Fang, Lin-lin; Zhao, Chen-yao; Jiang, Ping; Li, Yu-Feng; Bai, Juan",Veterinary Microbiology,117,3

This need has led to the appearance of a variety of neutralization assays used by different laboratories and companies. Using plasma samples from COVID-19 convalescent individuals with mild-to-moderate disease from a localized outbreak in a single region of the western US, we compared three platforms for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization: assay with live SARS-CoV-2, pseudovirus assay utilizing lentiviral (LV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) packaging, and a surrogate ELISA test. Vero, Vero E6, HEK293T cells expressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), and TZM-bl cells expressing hACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) were evaluated. Live-virus and LV-pseudovirus assay with HEK293T cells showed similar geometric mean titers (GMTs) ranging 141-178, but VSV-pseudovirus assay yielded significantly higher GMT (310 95%CI 211-454; p < 0.001). Fifty percent neutralizing dilution (ND50) titers from live-virus and all pseudovirus assay readouts were highly correlated (Pearson r = 0.81-0.89). ND50 titers positively correlated with plasma concentration of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) (r = 0.63-0.89), but moderately correlated with nucleoprotein IgG (r = 0.46-0.73).

Currently, there is no effective method to cure COVID‐19. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may be able to effectively treat COVID‐19, especially for severe and critical patients. Menstrual blood‐derived MSCs have recently received much attention due to their superior proliferation ability and their lack of ethical problems. Forty‐four patients were enrolled from January to April 2020 in a multicenter, open‐label, nonrandomized, parallel‐controlled exploratory trial. Twenty‐six patients received allogeneic, menstrual blood‐derived MSC therapy, and concomitant medications (experimental group), and 18 patients received only concomitant medications (control group). The experimental group was treated with three infusions totaling 9 × 10(7) MSCs, one infusion every other day. Primary and secondary endpoints related to safety and efficacy were assessed at various time points during the 1‐month period following MSC infusion. Safety was measured using the frequency of treatment‐related adverse events (AEs).

Here, we illustrate why it is important, from a wellbeing perspective, to recognise such trade-offs, and provide a framework, based on the economic concept of ‘marginal analysis’, for doing so. We illustrate its potential through consideration of optimising the balance between reducing the reproductive rate (R) of the virus and further opening of the economy. The framework accommodates both perspectives in the health-vs-economy debate whereby, depending on where we are within the marginal analysis framework, either health issues are allowed to dominate or, below some threshold of R and/or background level of infection, health and economic considerations can be traded off against each other. Given the inevitability of such trade-offs, the framework exposes crucial questions to be addressed, such as: the critical value of R and/or background infection, above which health considerations predominate, and which may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; and the value of lives forgone resulting from the small increases in R and/or background infection levels that may have to be tolerated as the economy is gradually opened.","Donaldson, Cam; Mitton, Craig","Health economics, policy, and law",117,23

Sex, age, triage color-code at admission, cause of trauma and presence of symptoms related to COVID-19 infection, discharge diagnosis and discharge modes were investigated. Results: The lockdown period led to a reduction of 87.0% in ER admissions with a particular decrease in patients older than 12 years old. Moreover, a trend towards more severe codes and an increase in home-related injuries were observed during the pandemic, whereas the diagnosis of fracture was less frequent in the pre-pandemic group (p < 0.0001).

Methods: This manuscript presents results from a population-based registry study assessing treatment, comorbidities, and predictors of hospital death among COVID-19 patients with AKI from March 1st to May 31th, 2020. Death, oxygen delivery and ventilation, acute dialysis need, use of medications, and various clinical outcomes, in addition to the length of stay in the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU), were evaluated. Results: In Castile and Leon, the largest region of Spain, 10.87% of the patients admitted for COVID-19 (n = 7,307) developed AKI. These patients were known by having hypertension (57.93%), cardiovascular disease (48.99%), diabetes (26.7%) and chronic kidney disease (14.36%), and they used antibiotics (90.43%), antimalarials (60.45%), steroids (48.61%), antivirals (33.38%), anti-systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) drugs (9.45%), and tocilizumab (8.31%). Mortality among patients with AKI doubled that observed in patients without AKI (46.1 vs. 21.79%). Predictors of hospital death in COVID-19 patients with AKI were ventilation needs (OR = 5.9), treatment with steroids (OR = 1.7) or anti-SIRS (OR = 2.4), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurrence (OR = 2.8), and SIRS occurrence (OR = 2.5).

Here, we develop a novel cell-based vaccine candidate, namely K562-S, by utilizing human cell K562 as a cellular carrier to display Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 on the membrane. Analogous to the traditional inactivated vaccine, K562-S cells can be propagated to a large scale by culturing and completely lose their viability after exposure to X-ray irradiation or formalin. We in turn demonstrated high immunogenicity of formalin-inactivated K562-S vaccine in both mouse and non-human primates and its protective efficacy in mice. In mice, immunization with inactivated K562-S vaccines can elicit potent neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses persisting longer than 5 months. We consequently showed in a hACE2 mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection that a two-shot vaccination with adjuvanted K562-S rendered greater than 3 log reduction in viral lung load and concomitant ameliorated lung pathology. Of importance, the administration of the same regimen in non-human primates was able to induce a neutralizing antibody titer averaging three-fold higher relative to human convalescent serum. These results together support the promise of K562-based, S-protein-expressing vaccines as a novel vaccination approach against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, with a powerful capacity to carry external genes for cell-based vectors, this platform could rapidly generate two- and multiple-valent vaccines by incorporating SARS-CoV-2 mutants, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV.","He, Xiangchuan; Ding, Longfei; Cao, Kangli; Peng, Haoran; Gu, Chenjian; Li, Yutang; Li, Duoduo; Dong, Lanlan; Hong, Xiujing; Wang, Xiangwei; Fu, Meilan; Qiu, Chenli; Zhu, Cuisong; Zhang, Ziling; Song, Shu; Wang, Chenguang; Jiang, Zhengfan; Xie, Youhua; Qi, Zhongtian; Zhao, Chen; Zhao, Ping; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Xu, Jianqing",Emerging microbes & infections,117,16

Paired with the challenges associated with physical distancing (e.g. economic stress, job loss, food insecurity, housing challenges) and the simultaneous need to balance continued and new academic demands, impact will be wide-ranging. It is critical to determine the structure of the impact of this heterogeneous stressor (e.g. health concerns, pandemic worry, financial concerns) for prevention and intervention planning. Objective: Through an existing recruitment pipeline we were in a unique position to study the wide-ranging reach of this pandemic in a cohort of students for whom their university experiences were like no other cohort in history. Method: Data were collected from students who were in their third year of college during the onset of the pandemic; of the N = 1,899 in the cohort who were invited to participate in this COVID-related survey, 897 (47.2%) completed measures of impact between May and July of 2020. Results: A series of confirmatory and exploratory models were fit to examine the structure of the pandemic-related domains. Following estimation of a single-factor model, a correlated five factors model, as well as two second-order factor structures, the five correlated factors (exposure, worry, housing/food instability, social media, substance use) model was found to represent the data most appropriately, while producing an interpretable solution. Conclusions: These measurement model analyses set the stage for future research to examine how these correlated factors impact psychiatric, substance, and academic outcomes in this vulnerable population.","Bountress, Kaitlin E.; Cusack, Shannon E.; Conley, Abigail H.; Aggen, Steven H.; Vassileva, Jasmin; Dick, Danielle M.; Amstadter, Ananda B.",Eur J Psychotraumatol,117,6

The principal objective is to undertake a multicenter incident case–control study of <5-year-old children hospitalized with pneumonia in developing and emerging countries, aiming to identify the causative agents involved in pneumonia while assessing individual and microbial factors associated with the risk of severe pneumonia. METHODS/DESIGN: A multicenter case–control study, based on the GABRIEL network, is ongoing. Ten study sites are located in 9 countries over 3 continents: Brazil, Cambodia, China, Haiti, India, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, and Paraguay. At least 1,000 incident cases and 1,000 controls will be enrolled and matched for age and date. Cases are hospitalized children <5 years with radiologically confirmed pneumonia, and the controls are children without any features suggestive of pneumonia. Respiratory specimens are collected from all enrolled subjects to identify 19 viruses and 5 bacteria. Whole blood from pneumonia cases is being tested for 3 major bacteria. S. pneumoniae-positive specimens are serotyped. Urine samples from cases only are tested for detection of antimicrobial activity. The association between procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and pathogens is being evaluated. A discovery platform will enable pathogen identification in undiagnosed samples. DISCUSSION: This multicenter study will provide descriptive results for better understanding of pathogens responsible for pneumonia among children in developing countries.

To control the spread of the disease, screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate quarantine and treatment are a priority. Pathogenic laboratory testing is typically the gold standard, but it bears the burden of significant false negativity, adding to the urgent need of alternative diagnostic methods to combat the disease. Based on COVID-19 radiographic changes in CT images, this study hypothesized that artificial intelligence methods might be able to extract specific graphical features of COVID-19 and provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus saving critical time for disease control. METHODS: We collected 1065 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases along with those previously diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia. We modified the inception transfer-learning model to establish the algorithm, followed by internal and external validation. RESULTS: The internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 89.5% with a specificity of 0.88 and sensitivity of 0.87. The external testing dataset showed a total accuracy of 79.3% with a specificity of 0.83 and sensitivity of 0.67. In addition, in 54 COVID-19 images, the first two nucleic acid test results were negative, and 46 were predicted as COVID-19 positive by the algorithm, with an accuracy of 85.2%. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the proof-of-principle for using artificial intelligence to extract radiological features for timely and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis. KEY POINTS: • The study evaluated the diagnostic performance of a deep learning algorithm using CT images to screen for COVID-19 during the influenza season. • As a screening method, our model achieved a relatively high sensitivity on internal and external CT image datasets. • The model was used to distinguish between COVID-19 and other typical viral pneumonia, both of which have quite similar radiologic characteristics.","Wang, Shuai; Kang, Bo; Ma, Jinlu; Zeng, Xianjun; Xiao, Mingming; Guo, Jia; Cai, Mengjiao; Yang, Jingyi; Li, Yaodong; Meng, Xiangfei; Xu, Bo",Eur Radiol,117,26

Methods The study retrospectively included 19 patients with nucleic acid-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at our hospital from January 20 to March 5, 2020. The final follow-up date was March 14, 2020. The epidemiologic and clinical information was obtained through direct communication with the patients or their family members. Laboratory results retrieved from medical records and radiological images were analyzed both qualitatively by two senior chest radiologists as well as quantitatively via an artificial intelligence software. Results We identified 5 family clusters (13/19, 68.4%) from the study cohort. All cases had good clinical prognoses and were either mild (3/19) or moderate (16/19) clinical types. Fever (15/19, 78.9%) and dry cough (11/19, 57.9%) were common symptoms. Two patients received negative results for more than three consecutive viral nucleic acid tests. The longest interval between an initial CT abnormal finding and a confirmed diagnosis was 30 days. One patient's nucleic acid test turned positive on the follow-up examination after discharge. The presence of radiological abnormalities was non-specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Conclusions COVID-19 patients with mild or no clinical symptoms are common in Beijing, China. Radiological abnormalities are mostly non-specific and massive CT examinations for COVID-19 screening should be avoided. Analyses of the contact histories of diagnosed cases in combination with clinical, radiological and laboratory findings are crucial for the early detection of COVID-19. Close monitoring after discharge is also recommended.","Song, Lan; Zhu, Zhenchen; Zhao, Ruijie; Li, Pengchang; Tian, Duxue; Du, Tiekuan; Xu, Yan; Yang, Qiwen; Cao, Wei; Song, Wei; Jin, Zhengyu",Chinese Medical Sciences Journal,117,1

However, concrete evidence of its benefit in reducing mortality in severe COVID-19 is lacking. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies that compared the efficacy of TCZ in severe COVID-19 vs. standard of care (SOC) alone. Methods: A literature search for studies that compared “tocilizumab” and “standard of care” in the treatment of COVID-19 was done using major online databases from December 2019 to June 14, 2020. Search words “Tocilizumab,” “anti-interleukin-6 antibody,” and “COVID-19” or “coronavirus 2019” in various combinations were used. Articles in the form of abstracts, letters without original data, case reports, and reviews were excluded. Data were gathered on an Excel sheet, and statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3. Results: Sixteen studies were eligible from 693 initial studies, including 3,641 patients (64% males). There were 13 retrospective studies and three prospective studies. There were 2,488 patients in the SOC group (61.7%) and 1,153 patients (68.7%) in the TCZ group. The death rate in the TCZ group, 22.4% (258/1,153), was lower than in the SOC group, 26.21% (652/2,488) [pooled odds ratio 0.57 (95% CI 0.36–0.92), p = 0.02]. There was a significant heterogeneity (inconsistency index = 80%) among the included studies. Conclusion: The addition of TCZ to the SOC might reduce mortality in severe COVID-19.

Under this situation, some people began to experience emotions of anxiety and depression. This article reports a case of depression with fever caused by the stress tension of the pandemic. The patient was highly suspected to have contracted COVID-19. The reported patient, who had a history of depression and had been to Wuhan to attend an exam, showed obvious pre-exam anxiety under the epidemic situation, which gradually increased the patient's pressure and then caused some adverse symptoms, such as insomnia, anxiety, sweating and a reoccurrent fever. Local community authorities paid close attention to him and later sent him to a general hospital in Jingmen for quarantine and treatment, as he was suspected of having COVID-19. After being hospitalised for half a month, he was ruled out from having ‘COVID-19’ and was cured of depression and discharged from the hospital. From this case, we can realise that, under the situation of the epidemic, people are easily prone to insomnia, anxiety and even depression.

Even in settings with established antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes, there were weaknesses exposed regarding appropriate antibiotic use in the context of the pandemic. Moreover, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance and AMS have been deprioritised with diversion of health system resources to the pandemic response. This experience highlights deficiencies in AMR containment and mitigation strategies that require urgent attention from clinical and scientific communities. These include the need to implement diagnostic stewardship to assess the global incidence of coinfections and secondary infections in COVID-19 patients, including those by multidrug-resistant pathogens, to identify patients most likely to benefit from antibiotic treatment and identify when antibiotics can be safely withheld, de-escalated or discontinued. Long-term global surveillance of clinical and societal antibiotic use and resistance trends is required to prepare for subsequent changes in AMR epidemiology, while ensuring uninterrupted supply chains and preventing drug shortages and stock outs. These interventions present implementation challenges in resource-constrained settings, making a case for implementation research on AMR. Knowledge and support for these practices will come from internationally coordinated, targeted research on AMR, supporting the preparation for future challenges from emerging AMR in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemics.","Rodríguez-Baño, Jesús; Rossolini, Gian Maria; Schultsz, Constance; Tacconelli, Evelina; Murthy, Srinivas; Ohmagari, Norio; Holmes, Alison; Bachmann, Till; Goossens, Herman; Canton, Rafael; Roberts, Adam P; Henriques-Normark, Birgitta; Clancy, Cornelius J; Huttner, Benedikt; Fagerstedt, Patriq; Lahiri, Shawon; Kaushic, Charu; Hoffman, Steven J; Warren, Margo; Zoubiane, Ghada; Essack, Sabiha; Laxminarayan, Ramanan; Plant, Laura",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,117,1

Although there are many diagnostic tools, an accurate and rapid laboratory procedure for diagnosing COVID-19 is recommended. We focused on platelet parameters as the additional biomarkers for clinical diagnosis in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five hundred and sixty-one patients from February to April 2020 have been recruited. Patients were divided into three groups: (N = 50) COVID-19 positive and (N = 21) COVID-19 negative with molecular testing, (N = 490) as reference population without molecular testing. A Multiplex rRT-PCR from samples collected by nasopharyngeal swabs was performed and the hematological data collected. RESULTS: We detected a mild anemia in COVID-19 group and lymphopenia against reference population: hemoglobin (g/dL) 13.0 (11.5-14.8) versus 13.9 (12.8-15.0) (P = .0135); lymphocytes (109 /L) 1.24 (0.94-1.73) versus 1.99 (1.49-2.64) (P < .0001). In addition, abnormal platelet parameters as follows (COVID group vs reference population): PLT (×109 /L) 209 (160-258) vs 236 (193-279) (P = .0239). IPF (%) 4.05 (2.5-5.9) versus 3.4 (2.2-4.9) (P = .0576); H-IPF (%) 1.25 (0.8-2.2) versus 0.95 (0.6-1.5) (P = .0171) were identified. In particular, COVID positive group had a high H-IPF/IPF Ratio compared to reference population [0.32 (0.29-0.36) versus 0.29 (0.26-0.32), respectively, (P = .0003)]. Finally, a PLT difference of nearly 50 × 109 /L between pre/postCOVID-19 sampling for each patient was found (N = 42) (P = .0194). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 group results highlighted higher IPF and H-IPF values, with increased H-IPF/IPF Ratio, associated to PLT count reduction. These findings shall be adopted for a timely diagnosis of patients upon hospital admission.","Introcaso, Giovanni; Bonomi, Alice; Salvini, Laura; D'Errico, Tiziana; Cattaneo, Annalisa; Assanelli, Emilio; Barbieri, Silvia Stella; Biondi, Maria Luisa",Int. j. lab. hematol,117,4

Such techniques have recently been applied to characterize and monitor SARS-CoV-2 , the etiological agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the isolation and culture of SARS-CoV-2 is time consuming and requires biosafety level 3 containment, which is not ideal for many resource-constrained settings. An alternate method, bait capture allows target enrichment and sequencing of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome eliminating the need for viral culture. This method uses a set of hybridization probes known as ""baits"" that span the genome and provide sensitive, accurate, and minimal off-target hybridization. Baits can be designed to detect any known virus or bacteria in a wide variety of specimen types, including oral secretions. The bait capture method presented herein allows the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva to be sequenced without the need to culture and provides an outline of bait design and bioinformatic analysis to guide a bioinformatician.","Speicher, David J; Nasir, Jalees A; Zhou, Peng; Anderson, Danielle E",Methods Mol Biol,117,18

Of these, the locked conformation was not previously observed for SARS-CoV-1 S and its function remains poorly understood. Here we engineered a SARS-CoV-2 S protein construct “S-R/x3” to arrest SARS-CoV-2 spikes in the locked conformation by a disulfide bond. Using this construct we determined high-resolution structures revealing two distinct locked states, with or without the D614G substitution that has become fixed in the globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. The D614G mutation induces a structural change in domain D from locked-1 to locked-2 conformation to alter spike dynamics, promoting transition into the closed conformation from which opening of the receptor binding domain is permitted. The transition from locked to closed conformations is additionally promoted by a change from low to neutral pH. We propose that the locked conformations of S are present in the acidic cellular compartments where virus is assembled and egresses. In this model, release of the virion into the neutral pH extracellular space would favour transition to the closed form which itself can stochastically transition into the open form. The S-R/x3 construct provides a tool for the further structural and functional characterization of the locked conformations of S, as well as how sequence changes might alter S assembly and regulation of receptor binding domain dynamics.","Qu, Kun; Xiong, Xiaoli; Ciazynska, Katarzyna A.; Carter, Andrew P.; Briggs, John A.

A questionnaire was distributed to Chinese adults living in 31 provinces of China via the internet using a snowball sampling strategy. Information on 7-day physical activity recall, screen time, and emotional state were collected between January 24 and February 2, 2020. ANOVA, χ² test, and Spearman’s correlation coefficients were used for statistical analysis. 12,107 participants aged 18–80 years were included. During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, nearly 60% of Chinese adults had inadequate physical activity (95% CI 56.6%–58.3%), which was more than twice the global prevalence (27.5%, 25.0%–32.2%). Their mean screen time was more than 4 hours per day while staying at home (261.3 ± 189.8 min per day), and the longest screen time was found in young adults (305.6 ± 217.5 min per day). We found a positive and significant correlation between provincial proportions of confirmed COVID-19 cases and negative affect scores (r = 0.501, p = 0.004). Individuals with vigorous physical activity appeared to have a better emotional state and less screen time than those with light physical activity. During this nationwide lockdown, more than half of Chinese adults temporarily adopted a sedentary lifestyle with insufficient physical activity, more screen time, and poor emotional state, which may carry considerable health risks. Promotion of home-based self-exercise can potentially help improve health and wellness.","Qin, Fei; Song, Yiqing; Nassis, George P; Zhao, Lina; Dong, Yanan; Zhao, Cuicui; Feng, Yiwei; Zhao, Jiexiu",Int J Environ Res Public Health,117,16

In this context, we aim to assess the Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (BEmONC) service availability and readiness in health facilities in Nepal by analyzing data from Nepal Health Facility Survey (NHFS), 2015. METHODS: We utilized cross-sectional data from the nationally representative NHFS, 2015. Service availability was measured by seven signal functions of BEmONC, and service readiness by the availability and functioning of supportive items categorized into three domains: staff and guidelines, diagnostic equipment, and basic medicine and commodities. We used the World Health Organization’s service availability and readiness indicators to estimate the readiness scores. We performed a multiple linear regression to identify important factors in the readiness of the health facilities to provide BEmONC services. RESULTS: The BEmONC service readiness score was significantly higher in public hospitals compared with private hospitals and peripheral public health facilities. Significant factors associated with service readiness score were the facility type (14.69 points higher in public hospitals, P<0.001), number of service delivery staff (2.49 points increase per each additional delivery staff, P<0.001), the service hours (4.89 points higher in facilities offering 24-hour services, P = 0.01) and status of periodic review of maternal and newborn deaths (4.88 points higher in facilities that conducted periodic review, P = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that BEmONC services in Nepal could be improved by increasing the number of service delivery staff, expanding service hours to 24-hours a day, and conducting periodic review of maternal and newborn deaths at health facilities, mainly in the peripheral public health facilities. The private hospitals need to be encouraged for BEmONC service readiness.","Acharya, Kiran; Subedi, Raj Kumar; Dahal, Sushma; Karkee, Rajendra",PLoS One,117,20

Moreover, research has demonstrated that engaging in planful problem-solving activities is associated with reduced distress. Accordingly, we aimed to examine the link between engaging in activities during COVID-19 and psychological distress among Holocaust survivors with varying levels of post-traumatic symptoms (PTS) and comparisons (not directly exposed to the Holocaust). DESIGN A cross-sectional design composed of Holocaust survivors and a comparison group. SETTING Participants were interviewed face-to-face, over the telephone, or filled the scales online at their leisure. PARTICIPANTS Data were collected from 131 older Jewish Israelis (age range 76-94, M = 82.73, SD = 4.09), who were divided into three groups (comparisons; low-PTS survivors; high-PTS survivors). MEASUREMENTS Participants completed scales assessing PTS, activity engagement, and psychological distress and provided additional sociodemographic, medical, and COVID-19-related information. RESULTS When activity engagement was low, high-PTS survivors reported extremely high levels of psychological distress relative to low-PTS survivors and comparisons. However, when activity engagement was high, these group differences were considerably reduced, as the psychological distress of high-PTS survivors was significantly lower. CONCLUSIONS The study highlights the importance of daily planning and activity engagement for Holocaust survivors with high PTS levels in reducing psychological distress. Clinicians are urged to take this factor into account when dealing with the psychological effects of COVID-19 on survivors and on traumatized older adults in general.","Bergman, Yoav S; Maytles, Ruth; Frenkel-Yosef, Maya; Shrira, Amit",International psychogeriatrics,117,1

Large-volume aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastric contents is essential for the development of aspiration pneumonitis. The role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea is often underestimated as a rare etiological factor for aspiration in the diagnosis process of aspiration pneumonitis. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a patient with 4 weeks of right-sided watery rhinorrhea accompanied by intermittent postnasal drip and dry cough as the main symptoms. Combined with clinical symptoms, imaging examination of the sinuses, and laboratory examination of nasal secretions, she was initially diagnosed as spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele with CSF rhinorrhea, and intraoperative endoscopic findings and postoperative pathology also confirmed this diagnosis. Her chest computed tomography showed multiple flocculent ground glass density shadows in both lungs on admission. The patient underwent endoscopic resection of meningoencephalocele and repair of skull base defect after she was ruled out of viral pneumonitis. Symptoms of rhinorrhea and dry cough disappeared, and pneumonitis was improved 1 week after surgery and cured 2 months after surgery. Persistent CSF rhinorrhea caused by spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele was eventually found to be a major etiology for aspiration pneumonitis although the absence of typical symptoms and well-defined risk factors for aspiration, such as dysphagia, impaired cough reflex and reflux diseases. CONCLUSIONS: We report a rare case of aspiration pneumonitis caused by spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele with CSF rhinorrhea, which can bring more attention and understanding to the uncommon etiology for aspiration, so as to make more accurate diagnosis of the disease and early surgical treatment.","Cao, Jiayu; Liu, Wei; Wang, Li; Yang, Yujuan; Zhang, Yu; Song, Xicheng",BMC Pulm Med,117,1

This article employs satellite data on real-time active fire locations in Nepal to evaluate the short-term environmental effects of COVID-19. Using plausibly exogenous variation in the number of reported COVID-19 cases across the country, this study finds that the incidence of COVID-19 led to a strong negative effect on the incidence of human-induced forest fires. Results indicate that an additional reported case of COVID-19 resulted in a 4.54% decrease in the number of forest fire incidents and a 11.36% reduction in fire radiative power associated with these events. Findings also show that districts with smaller areas of community-managed forests per capita experienced a 8.11% decrease in the number of forest fire incidents. Restrictions on movement of people across districts in response to the pandemic likely reduced the incidence of forest fire events in Nepal.

Oxidative stress and inflammation are closely related to ALI. Innate immune cells are the main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Macrophages play an extremely important role in ALI through the activation of inflammation and oxidative stress. Itaconate, a metabolite of tricarboxylic acid, has been reported to have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the role of itaconate in ALI is unclear. Herein, we use 4-octyl itaconate (OI), the cellular permeable derivate of itaconate, to study the effects of itaconate in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: We used OI to pretreat C57BL/6 mice and LPS-induced ALI models to illustrate the role of itaconate in acute lung injury. The mice were randomly divided into four groups: control group, OI (100 mg/kg) group, ALI Group, ALI + OI (50 mg/kg) group, and ALI + OI (100 mg/kg) group. RAW264.7 cells were used to further prove the role and mechanism of itaconate in vitro. RESULTS: According to the H&E staining of the lung, OI was observed to significantly reduce lung inflammation. The active oxygen content of tissues was also significantly reduced (P<0.05). OI reduced the accumulation of neutrophils and secretion of inflammatory factors in LPS-induced ALI (P<0.05). At the cellular level, OI also reduced oxidative stress and inflammation. Intervention with OI was also observed to upregulate the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf-2) and Nrf-2 target genes in the lung tissue and RAW264.7 cells. CONCLUSION: OI alleviates LPS-induced ALI. Moreover, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of OI might depend on the activation of Nrf-2. Therefore, OI might have therapeutic potential for the treatment of ALI.","Li, Yang; Chen, Xing; Zhang, Hua; Xiao, Jie; Yang, Chuanlei; Chen, Weiqiang; Wei, Zhanjie; Chen, Xinzhong; Liu, Jinping",Drug Des Devel Ther,117,4

METHODS: Ninety-five patients were assessed with the Brief Smell Identification Test for Chinese (B-SITC) and Hyposmia Rating Scale (HRS) after 16 weeks from disease onset. Five weeks later, 41 patients were retested with B-SITC. RESULTS: At the first visit, hyposmia was identified in 26/82 (31.7%) and 22/95 (23.2%) of participants by HRS (HRS score ≤22) and B-SITC (B-SITC score <8), respectively. The rates of hyposmia in patients who performed B-SITC after 14–15 weeks, 16–17 weeks, and ≥18 weeks from disease onset were 7/25 (28%), 8/35 (23%) and 7/35 (20%), respectively, which demonstrated a trend of olfaction improvement as recovery time prolonging. Hyposmia percentages decreased from the first visit (34.1%) to the second visit (24.4%) for the 41 patients who completed 2 visits. B-SITC scores of the first-visit hyposmia participants increased significantly at the second visit (5.29 ± 2.02 to 8.29 ± 2.40; n = 14, P = 0.001). Severe cases tended to recover less than common cases. CONCLUSIONS: Hyposmia was present in up to one-third of COVID-19 patients after about 3 months from disease onset. Notable recovery of olfactory function was observed at a next 5-weeks follow-up. Clinical severity had little influence on olfactory impairment and recovery.","Zhu, Yuanyuan; Cao, Ming; Zheng, Peng; Shen, Wei",J Clin Neurosci,117,10
