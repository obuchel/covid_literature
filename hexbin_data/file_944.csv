The seroprevalence of purebreds (66.7%) was higher than that of random breds (31.2%). Seroprevalence increased greatly in purebreds by three months of age, while it did not fluctuate greatly in random breds with aging, indicating that cattery environments can contribute to FCoV epidemics. Purebreds from northern regions of Japan were likely to be seropositive (76.6% in Hokkaido, 80.0% in Tohoku), indicating cattery cats in cold climates might be more closely confined. Among purebreds, the American shorthair, Himalayan, Oriental, Persian, and Siamese showed low seroprevalence, while the American curl, Maine coon, Norwegian forest cat, ragdoll and Scottish fold showed high seroprevalence. There would also be breed-related differences in Japan similar to the previous studies in Australia.","Taharaguchi, Satoshi; Soma, Takehisa; Hara, Motonobu",The Journal of veterinary medical science,944,24

However, few studies have attempted to explore the factors affecting disease infection from a social perspective. Here, we argue that trust, which plays an important role in shaping people' s risk perception toward hazards, can also affect risk perception toward infections from a social perspective. Drawing on the indication that risk perception of diseases helps prevent people from being infected by promoting responsible behaviors, it can be further asserted that trust may alter the infection rate of diseases as a result of risk perception toward infectious diseases. This is an essential point for preventing the spread of infectious diseases and should be demonstrated. To empirically test this prediction, this study uses the COVID-19 outbreak in China as an example and applies an original dataset combining real-time big data, official data, and social survey data from 317 cities in 31 Chinese provinces to demonstrate whether trust influences the infection rate of diseases. Multilevel regression analyses reveal three main results: (1) trust in local government and media helps to reduce the infection rate of diseases; (2) generalized trust promotes a higher rather than lower infection rate; and (3) the effects of different types of trust are either completely or partly mediated by risk perception toward diseases. The theoretical and practical implications of this study provide suggestions for improving the public health system in response to possible infectious diseases.","Ye, Maoxin; Lyu, Zeyu",Soc Sci Med,944,18

In addition, four different coping strategies were investigated. The study was conducted in Germany with data from 665 participants (53.8% female; 18-73 years), who completed an online questionnaire in April 2020. The results revealed that COVID-19 worry was associated with impaired well-being and sleep. Meaning- and problem-focused coping were the most frequently used coping strategies, and showed positive associations with well-being and sleep. Social and avoidance coping were associated with decreased well-being and worse sleep outcomes. Three coping strategies showed moderating effects. People who worried more showed higher levels of positive affect when they used problem-focused coping compared to those who did not. Similarly, highly worried participants showed lower levels of negative affect when they reported using meaning-focused coping more often. In contrast, social coping increased the risk of high negative affect levels in worried participants. In conclusion, problem-focused and meaning-focused coping strategies seemed to be most effective in coping with COVID-19 challenges.","Saalwirth, Christina; Leipold, Bernhard",Stress health (Online),944,16

This study explored the knowledge of the population of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) about COVID-19 preventive measures and their belief about the consumption of herbal products for the prevention of COVID-19 infection. A total of 5,258 individuals participated in this study. Participants' knowledge about the appropriate COVID-19 preventive measures in terms of handwashing procedures, self-quarantine and social distancing was moderate, with a mean score of 5.5 (SD: 1.7) out of 10 (representing around 55.0% of the total score). About 22.1% (n= 1,161) of the participants reported that they have used herbal products or nutritional supplements during the pandemic period, to protect themselves from the disease. Social media and the Internet (39.4%, n= 372) were the main motivators for the participants to try herbal products. Vitamin C was the most commonly used food supplement to increase immunity and reduces the chance of contracting COVID-19. Our study demonstrated that the general population in Saudi Arabia has a moderate level of knowledge about COVID-19 transmission and preventive measures. A considerable proportion of the population reported the use of herbal products or food supplements in order to protect themselves from the disease. Policymakers are suggested to provide further educational campaigns that increase population knowledge about the disease transmission routes and preventive measures.

COVID-19 is more pathogenic and infectious than the prior 2002 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-1. The pathogenesis of certain disease manifestations in COVID-19 such as diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) are thought to be similar to SARS-CoV-1. However, the exact pathogenesis of COVID-19 related deaths remains poorly understood. The aim of this article was to systematically summarize the rapidly emerging literature regarding COVID-19 autopsies. A meta-analysis was also conducted based on data accrued from preprint and published articles on COVID-19 (n=241 patients) and the results compared with postmortem findings associated with SARS-CoV-1 deaths (n=91 patients). Both autopsy groups included mostly adults of median age 70 years with COVID-19 and 50 years with SARS-CoV-1. Overall, prevalence of DAD was more common in SARS-CoV-1 (100.0%) than COVID-19 (80.9%) autopsies (P=0.001). Extrapulmonary findings among both groups were not statistically significant except for hepatic necrosis (P <0.001), splenic necrosis (P<0.006) and white pulp depletion (P <0.001) that were more common with SARS-CoV-1.

Group testing strategies to increase capacity facilitate mass population testing but do not prioritize turnaround time, an important consideration for HCW screening. We propose a nonadaptive combinatorial (NAC) group testing strategy to increase throughput while facilitating rapid turnaround. NAC matrices were constructed for sample sizes of 700, 350, and 250. Matrix performance was tested by simulation under different SARS-CoV-2 prevalence scenarios of 0.1% to 10%. NAC matrices were compared versus Dorfman sequential (DS) group testing approaches. NAC matrices performed well at low prevalence levels, with an average of 97% of samples resolved after a single round of testing via the n = 700 matrix at a prevalence of 1%. In simulations of low to medium (0.1% to 3%) prevalence, all NAC matrices were superior to the DS strategy, measured by fewer repeated tests required. At very high prevalence levels (10%), the DS matrix was marginally superior, although both group testing approaches performed poorly at high prevalence levels. This strategy maximizes the proportion of samples resolved after a single round of testing, allowing prompt return of results to HCWs. This methodology may allow laboratories to adapt their testing scheme based on required throughput and the current population prevalence, facilitating a data-driven testing strategy.","McDermott, John H; Stoddard, Duncan; Woolf, Peter J; Ellingford, Jamie M; Gokhale, David; Taylor, Algy; Demain, Leigh A M; Newman, William G; Black, Graeme",J Mol Diagn,944,1

METHODS: The data for the current analysis (N = 50 countries) were retrieved from the John Hopkins University dataset on the 7th of May 2020, with countries as study units. A piecewise regression analysis was conducted with mortality and cumulative incidence rates introduced as dependent variables and time interval (days from the 22nd of January to the date when 100 first cases were reported) as the main predictor. The country average life expectancy at birth and outpatient contacts per person per year were statistically adjusted for in the regression model. RESULTS: Mortality and incidence were strongly and inversely intercorrelated with days from January 22, respectively -0.83 (p<0.001) and -0.73 (p<0.001). Adjusting for average life expectancy and outpatients contacts per person per year, between days 33 to 50 from the 22nd of the January, the average mortality rate decreased by 30.1/million per day (95% CI: 22.7, 37.6, p<0.001). During interval 51 to 73 days, the change in mortality was no longer statistically significant but still showed a decreasing trend. A similar relationship with time interval was found for incidence. Life expectancy and outpatients contacts per person per year were not associated with mortality rate. CONCLUSION: Countries in Europe that had the earliest COVID-19 circulation suffered the worst consequences in terms of health outcomes, specifically mortality. The drastic social isolation measures, quickly undertaken in response to those initial outbreaks appear effective, especially in Eastern European countries, where community circulation started after March 11th. The study demonstrates that efforts to delay the early spread of the virus may have saved an average 30 deaths daily per one million inhabitants.","Ylli, Alban; Wu, Yan Yan; Burazeri, Genc; Pirkle, Catherine; Sentell, Tetine",PLoS One,944,24

This article presents a comprehensive overview on the two most promising remedial approaches that are being attempted for the management, treatment, and plausible cure of nCOVID-19. In this context, chemotherapeutic approach primarily aims to interrupt the interactions between the host and the virus causing inhibition of its entry into the host cell and/or its proliferation and suppressing the inflammatory milieu in the infected patients. On the other side, immunotherapeutic approaches aim to modulate the host immunity by fine tuning the inflammatory signaling cascades to achieve phylaxis from the virus and restoring immune-homeostasis.

For this investigation, data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Dartmouth Atlas Project, and the 2005 to 2014 annual surveys of the American Hospital Association (AHA) were analyzed. The HMSPI tool uses variables from the AHA survey and the other two sources to allow facility, county, and referral area index calculations. Using the three data sets, the HMSPI also allows for an index calculation for per capita ratios and by political (state or county) boundaries. In this use case, the results demonstrated increases in county and state HMSPI scores through the period of analysis; however, no statistically significant difference was found in HMSPI scores between 2013 and 2014. The HMSPI builds on the limited scientific foundation of medical surge preparedness and could serve as an objective and standardized measure to assess the nation's medical readiness for crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other large-scale emergencies such as mass shootings. Future studies are encouraged to refine the score, assess the validity of the HMSPI, and evaluate its relevance in response to future legislative and executive policies that affect preparedness measures.","Marcozzi, David E; Pietrobon, Ricardo; Lawler, James V; French, Michael T; Mecher, Carter; Baehr, Nicole E; Browne, Brian J",J. healthc. manag,944,1

This vaccine formulation is similar to one that entered advanced phase 3 clinical development in India. We compared the immune response of mice vaccinated with RBD219-N1C1/alum to mice vaccinated with RBD219-N1C1/alum+CpG. We also evaluated mice immunized with RBD219-N1C1/alum+CpG and boosted with RBD219-N1C1/alum. Mice were immunized twice intramuscularly at a 21-day interval. Compared to two doses of the RBD219-N1C1/alum formulation, the RBD219-N1C1/alum+CpG vaccine induced a stronger and more balanced Th1/Th2 cellular immune response, with high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the original Wuhan isolate of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.617.1 (Kappa) variants. Notably, the sera from mice that received two 7 {micro}g doses of RBD219-N1C1/alum+CpG showed more than 18 times higher neutralizing antibody titers against B.1.351, than the WHO International Standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin NIBSC 20/136. Interestingly, a booster dose did not require the addition of CpG to induce this effect. The data reported here reinforces that the RBD219-N1C1/alum+CpG vaccine formulation is suitable for inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 including three variants of concern, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and B.1.617.1 (Kappa).","Pollet, Jeroen; Strych, Ulrich; Chen, Wen-Hsiang; Versteeg, Leroy; Keegan, Brian; Zhan, Bin; Wei, Junfei; Liu, Zhuyun; Lee, Jungsoon; Kundu, Rakhi; Adhikari, Rakesh; Poveda, Cristina; Villar, Maria Jose; Lopez, Brianna; Gillespie, Portia M.; Ronca, Shannon; Kimata, Jason T.; Reers, Martin; Paradkar, Vikram; Hotez, Peter; Bottazzi, Maria Elena",,944,20

The pandemic and confinement influence the behaviour of the population, perhaps more reticent to contact emergency departments flooded with COVID-19 patients and likely to have modified levels of stress. In addition, it was shown that confinement during the pandemic reduced air pollution, thought to affect stroke risk.

Ozonation is commonly utilized as pre-oxidation process to enhance the disinfection of hospital wastewater during COVID-19 spread. In this study, the transformation of ribavirin, antiviral for COVID-19, during ozone/PMS­chlorine intensified disinfection process was investigated. â¢OH followed by O3 accounted for the dominant ribavirin degradation in most conditions due to higher reaction rate constant between ribavirin and â¢OH vs. SO4â¢- (1.9 × 109 vs. 7.9 × 107 M-1 s-1, respectively). During the O3/PMS process, ribavirin was dehydrogenated at the hydroxyl groups first, then lost the amide or the methanol group. Chloride at low concentrations (e.g., 0.5- 2 mg/L) slightly accelerated ribavirin degradation, while bromide, iodide, bicarbonate, and dissolved organic matter all reduced the degradation efficiency. In the presence of bromide, O3/PMS process resulted in the formation of organic brominated oxidation by-products (OBPs), the concentration of which increased with increasing bromide dosage. However, the formation of halogenated OBPs was negligible when chloride or iodide existed. Compared to the O3/H2O2 process, the concentration of brominated OBPs was significantly higher after ozonation or the O3/PMS process. This study suggests that the potential risks of the organic brominated OBPs should be taken into consideration when ozonation and ozone-based processes are used to enhance disinfection in the presence of bromide amid COVID-19 pandemic.","Liu, Xiaoyu; Hong, Yuntao; Ding, Shunke; Jin, Wei; Dong, Shengkun; Xiao, Rong; Chu, Wenhai",Sci Total Environ,944,1

Although not completely understood, SARS-CoV-2 may have the same means of transmission. Preventive social measures aimed at preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread could impact transmission of other respiratory viruses as well. The aim of this study is to report the detection of RSV and influenza during the period of social distancing due to COVID-19 pandemic in a heavily affected community. Methods: Prospective study with pediatric and adult populations seeking care for COVID-19-like symptoms during the fall and winter of 2020 at two hospitals in Southern Brazil. RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A (Flu A), influenza B (Flu B) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was performed for all participants. Results: 1435 suspected COVID-19 participants (1137 adults, and 298 children). were included between May and August.

Telemedicine was implemented in many otolaryngological departments to ensure the continuous care. The purpose of this study is to report our experience about telemedicine in 86 patients consulting virtually in our departments. METHODS: A total of 86 patients benefited from telemedicine consultation from April to Mai May 2020. Patients and physicians were invited to fulfill a satisfaction survey over the 3 days after the consultation. RESULTS: Patients consulted in the following fields: laryngology, voice and swallowing (N=15; 17.4%), head and neck or plastic surgery (N=34; 39.5%), rhinology (N=31; 36.1%) and otology (N=6; 7.0%). Practitioners estimated that the clinical examination would not have changed the consultation issue in 73.2% of cases. The realization of delayed clinical examination was rapidly necessary in 9.3% of cases and useless in 33.7% of cases. Five percent of patients estimated that the consultation did not bring reliable conclusion. Although the majority of patient (87.7%) would recommend telemedicine consultation to friend/family in the context of pandemic, only 44.6% would accept to replace office- consultation by telemedicine consultation outside the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine appears to be an interesting alternative approach in situation of pandemic and lock-down. Because the patient motivation to further participate to telemedicine appears to be conditioned by the context, efforts are still required to understand the patient perception, satisfaction and fears in view of future implementation outside pandemic.","Lechien, Jérôme R; Radulesco, Thomas; Distinguin, Lea; Chekkoury-Idrissi, Younes; Circiu, Marta P; Afia, Fahd El; Michel, Justin; Papon, Jean-François; Hans, Stephane",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,944,16

On the one hand, the simulation results indicate that the US COVID-19 recession has a negative impact on other countries’ economic growth through trade ties, reducing the economic growth of other countries, especially for countries which have a close trade relationship with the US. In addition, the spillover effects of the US economic recession have different impacts on other countries’ energy consumption. Countries with the closest trade ties to the US are most affected, such as Japan and China. In addition, the impact of the US’ economic shock on energy consumption in developing countries is significant in the short term, while its impact on developed countries is significant in the long term. On the other hand, the simulation results of energy spillover effects indicate a reduction in US energy consumption slightly reduces economic growth in other nations. In addition, a reduction in energy consumption in the US does not have a significant negative impact on energy consumption in other developed countries. Furthermore, the spillover effect of declining energy consumption in the US on energy consumption in developing countries is significant in the short term. However, the spillover effects of falling energy consumption in the US on developing countries are different.

Given the extensive impact of COVID-19 globally, there is international interest to learn from best practices that have been shown to work in controlling community spread to inform future outbreaks. This study explores the trajectory of COVID-19 infection in Singapore had the government intervention not focused on containment, but rather on mitigation. In addition, we estimate the actual COVID-19 infection cases in Singapore, given that confirmed cases are publicly available. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a COVID-19 infection model, which is a modified SIR model that differentiate between detected (diagnosed) and undetected (undiagnosed) individuals and segments total population into seven health states: susceptible (S), infected asymptomatic undiagnosed (A), infected asymptomatic diagnosed (I), infected symptomatic undiagnosed (U), infected symptomatic diagnosed (E), recovered (R), and dead (D). To account for the infection stages of the asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals, the asymptomatic infected individuals were further disaggregated into three infection stages: (a) latent (b) infectious and (c) non-infectious; while the symptomatic infected were disaggregated into two stages: (a) infectious and (b) non-infectious. The simulation result shows that by the end of the current epidemic cycle without considering the possibility of a second wave, under the containment intervention implemented in Singapore, the confirmed number of Singaporeans infected with COVID-19 (diagnosed asymptomatic and symptomatic cases) is projected to be 52,053 (with 95% confidence range of 49,370-54,735) representing 0.87% (0.83%-0.92%) of the total population; while the actual number of Singaporeans infected with COVID-19 (diagnosed and undiagnosed asymptomatic and symptomatic infected cases) is projected to be 86,041 (81,097-90,986), which is 1.65 times the confirmed cases and represents 1.45% (1.36%-1.53%) of the total population. A peak in infected cases is projected to have occurred on around day 125 (27/05/2020) for the confirmed infected cases and around day 115 (17/05/2020) for the actual infected cases. The number of deaths is estimated to be 37 (34-39) among those infected with COVID-19 by the end of the epidemic cycle; consequently, the perceived case fatality rate is projected to be 0.07%, while the actual case fatality rate is estimated to be 0.043%. Importantly, our simulation model results suggest that there about 65% more COVID-19 infection cases in Singapore that have not been captured in the official reported numbers which could be uncovered via a serological study. Compared to the containment intervention, a mitigation intervention would have resulted in early peak infection, and increase both the cumulative confirmed and actual infection cases and deaths. CONCLUSION: Early public health measures in the context of targeted, aggressive containment including swift and effective contact tracing and quarantine, was likely responsible for suppressing the number of COVID-19 infections in Singapore.","Ansah, John P; Matchar, David Bruce; Shao Wei, Sean Lam; Low, Jenny G; Pourghaderi, Ahmad Reza; Siddiqui, Fahad Javaid; Min, Tessa Lui Shi; Wei-Yan, Aloysius Chia; Ong, Marcus Eng Hock",PLoS One,944,26

The vast majority of the countries worldwide being hit by the pandemic have shown the frailty of their health and social care systems. Although the surprise factor could somehow justify the unpreparedness experienced during the first wave, the second wave still led to significant difficulties almost everywhere. Looking at Italy's situation, it is evident how the stress test applied by COVID-19 on the system has threatened its stability, getting it closer to collapsing many times. It is true that Italy, in particular the Northern regions, has been the epicenter of COVID-19 in Europe in a time when information about the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was still lacking and confusing. Nevertheless, what happened has demonstrated significant issues in the structure, priorities, and organization of the system. It has exemplified the obsolete approach adopted in clinical practice, particularly when applied to frail older persons. The COVID-19 pandemic has made emerging the need for a substantial reshaping of our healthcare system. The hospital-centered model has dramatically failed. To adequately face the new challenges brought by the increasing complexity of our aging society, it is critical to move the barycenter of action toward the community/primary care, promoting the integration of services and centralization of clinical/administrative data. It is vital to train healthcare professionals in the identification and basic principles of geriatric conditions, clarifying the role that geriatricians play. In the present article, some cornerstone concepts of geriatric medicine (i.e., definition of geriatrics, multidisciplinarity, integrated care, and development of clinical databases for filling the evidence-based medicine gaps) are presented, explaining the challenges they have faced during the COVID-19 pandemic and possible solutions for implementing improvements in the future.","Crosignani, S.; Fantinati, J.; Cesari, M.",Frontiers in Medicine,944,24

Objective: To identify, appraise, and synthesize the scientific literature on the efficacy and effectiveness of SMT in preventing the development of infectious disease or improving disease-specific outcomes in patients with infectious disease and to examine the association between SMT and selected immunological, endocrine, and other physiological biomarkers. Evidence Review: A literature search of MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Index to Chiropractic Literature, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase was conducted from inception to April 15, 2020. Randomized clinical trials and cohort studies were included. Eligible studies were critically appraised, and evidence with high and acceptable quality was synthesized using the Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis guideline. Findings: A total of 2593 records were retrieved; after exclusions, 50 full-text articles were screened, and 16 articles reporting the findings of 13 studies comprising 795 participants were critically appraised. The literature search found no clinical studies that investigated the efficacy or effectiveness of SMT in preventing the development of infectious disease or improving disease-specific outcomes among patients with infectious disease. Eight articles reporting the results of 6 high- and acceptable-quality RCTs comprising 529 participants investigated the effect of SMT on biomarkers. Spinal manipulative therapy was not associated with changes in lymphocyte levels or physiological markers among patients with low back pain or participants who were asymptomatic compared with sham manipulation, a lecture series, and venipuncture control groups. Spinal manipulative therapy was associated with short-term changes in selected immunological biomarkers among asymptomatic participants compared with sham manipulation, a lecture series, and venipuncture control groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review of 13 studies, no clinical evidence was found to support or refute claims that SMT was efficacious or effective in changing immune system outcomes. Although there were limited preliminary data from basic scientific studies suggesting that SMT may be associated with short-term changes in immunological and endocrine biomarkers, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Given the lack of evidence that SMT is associated with the prevention of infectious diseases or improvements in immune function, further studies should be completed before claims of efficacy or effectiveness are made.","Chow, Ngai; Hogg-Johnson, Sheilah; Mior, Silvano; Cancelliere, Carol; Injeyan, Stephen; Teodorczyk-Injeyan, Julita; Cassidy, J David; Taylor-Vaisey, Anne; Côté, Pierre",JAMA Netw Open,944,21

In primary care, an advance care planning (ACP) group visit may leverage group dynamics and peer mentorship to facilitate education and personal goal setting that result in ACP engagement. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the ENgaging in Advance Care Planning Talks (ENACT) group visits intervention improves ACP documentation and readiness in older adults. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted among geriatric primary care patients from the University of Colorado Hospital Seniors Clinic, Aurora, CO, from August 2017 to November 2019. Participants randomized to ENACT group visits (n = 55) participated in two 2-hour sessions with discussions of ACP topics and use of ACP tools (i.e., Conversation Starter Kit, Medical Durable Power of Attorney form, and PREPARE videos). Participants randomized to the control arm (n = 55) received the Conversation Starter Kit and a Medical Durable Power of Attorney form by mail. The primary outcomes included presence of ACP documents or medical decision-maker documentation in the electronic health record (EHR) at 6 months, and a secondary outcome was ACP readiness (validated four-item ACP Engagement Survey) at 6 months. RESULTS: Participants were a mean of 77 years old, 60% female, and 79% white. At 6 months, 71% of ENACT participants had an advance directive in the EHR (26% higher) compared with 45% of control arm participants (P < .001). Similarly, 93% of ENACT participants had decision-maker documentation in the EHR (29% higher) compared with 73% in the control arm (P < .001). ENACT participants trended toward higher readiness to engage in ACP compared with control (4.56 vs 4.13; P = .16) at 6 months. CONCLUSION: An ACP group visit increased ACP documentation and readiness to engage in ACP behavior change. Primary care teams can explore implementation and adaptation of ACP group visits into routine care, as well as longer-term impact on patient health outcomes.","Lum, Hillary D; Dukes, Joanna; Daddato, Andrea E; Juarez-Colunga, Elizabeth; Shanbhag, Prajakta; Kutner, Jean S; Levy, Cari R; Sudore, Rebecca L",J. am. geriatr. soc,944,1

There are two types of stress: distress refers to harmful stimuli, while eustress refers to healthy, euphoric stimuli that create a sense of fulfillment and achievement. Telling the two types of stress apart is challenging, let alone quantifying their impact across corporations. We just did that for the S&P 500 companies in the U.S., and did so by leveraging a dataset of 440K company reviews published during twelve successive years, and developing a state-of-the-art deep-learning framework to accurately extract stress mentions from these reviews. We proposed a new methodology that places each company on a stress-by-rating quadrant (based on its overall stress score and overall rating on the site), and accordingly scores the company to be, on average, either a low stress, passive, negative stress, or positive stress company. We found that (former) employees of positive stress companies tended to describe high-growth and collaborative workplaces in their reviews, and that such companies' stock evaluations grew, on average, 5.1 times in 10 years (2009-2019) as opposed to the companies of the other three stress types that grew, on average, 3.7 times in the same time period.
