The health care infrastructure in Iraq is inadequately prepared to serve the health needs of the millions of pilgrims. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the temporary health care facilities installed and run by the local community to provide health care services to Arbaeenia pilgrims in Karbala, Iraq. METHODS: A survey was conducted in all community-based health care facilities located along part of Najaf to Karbala road within Karbala governorate. A structured questionnaire was answered through an interview with the workers and direct observation. Data were collected on staff profile, type of services provided, use of basic infection control measures, medical equipment, drugs and supplies, and the most commonly encountered medical problems. RESULTS: The total number of health care facilities was 120, staffed by 659 workers. Only 18 (15.0%, 18/120) facilities were licensed, and 44.1% (53/120) of the workers were health professionals. The health care workers provided different services including dispensing drugs (370/1692, 21.87%), measuring blood pressure and blood sugar (350/1692, 20.69%), and caring for wounds and injuries (319/1692, 18.85%). Around 97% (116/120) health facilities provided services for musculoskeletal disorders and only 16.7% (20/120) provided services for injuries. The drugs available in the clinic were analgesics, drugs for gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases, and antibiotics, with an availability range of 13.3% to 100.0%. Infection control practices for individual protection, environmental sanitation, and medical waste disposal were available in a range of 18.1% to 100.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Community-based health care facilities experienced a profound shortage of trained human resources and medical supplies. They can significantly contribute to health services if they are adequately equipped and follow standardized operation procedures.","Lami, Faris; Hameed, Inam; Arbaji, Ali",JMIR Public Health Surveill,204,5

Up to 12 per sex from each group were killed at 65 weeks, and hematology, clinical chemistry, and histopathology were evaluated. A complete histopatho-logical evaluation was performed on all other animals; survivors were killed at 2 years. Survival was significantly extended in tri-prolidine-treated males and females, particularly at the high dose. At the close of the study high-dose males and females had gained significantly less body weight than controls. Among rats killed at 65 weeks females in the mid- and high-dose groups weighed significantly less than controls, but weights of control and dosed males were not significantly different. The incidences of numerous lesions tended to decrease with increasing triprolidine dose. In females, clitoral gland adenomas, thyroid c-cell hyperplasia and neoplasia, mammary gland hyperplasia and fibroadenomas, and uterine stromal polyps, and in males, anterior pituitary gland adenomas, preputial gland neoplasia, thyroid c-cell hyperplasia, pancreatic islet neoplasia, mononuclear cell leukemia, and the combination of lymphocytic, histiocytic, and undifferentiated cell malignant lymphomas and mononuclear leukemia, all exhibited negative dose trends. Cytoplasmic alterations of the parotid gland and numerous liver lesions tended to be more frequent in treated than in control animals. Liver lesions that exhibited positive dose trends include chronic inflammation and centrilobular fatty change in both sexes, mixed cell foci, and the combination of mixed cell foci and eosinophilic foci in females, and in males, basophilic foci and eosinophilic foci.

This learning may be leveraged for computation, memory, and engineering. Until now, many-body learning has been detected with thermodynamic properties, such as work absorption and strain. We progress beyond these macroscopic properties first defined for equilibrium contexts: We quantify statistical mechanical learning using representation learning, a machine-learning model in which information squeezes through a bottleneck. By calculating properties of the bottleneck, we measure four facets of many-body systems’ learning: classification ability, memory capacity, discrimination ability, and novelty detection. Numerical simulations of a classical spin glass illustrate our technique. This toolkit exposes self-organization that eludes detection by thermodynamic measures: Our toolkit more reliably and more precisely detects and quantifies learning by matter while providing a unifying framework for many-body learning.","Zhong, Weishun; Gold, Jacob M.; Marzen, Sarah; England, Jeremy L.; Yunger Halpern, Nicole",Sci Rep,204,30
17660,17660,17660,A Social Media Organizational Productivity Model: Insights From Public Health Professionals,21.934267,3.9655247,2021-05-05,"BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) offers minimally invasive means to repeatedly interrogate tumor genomes, providing opportunities to monitor clonal dynamics induced by metastasis and therapeutic selective pressures. In metastatic cancers, ctDNA profiling allows for simultaneous analysis of both local and distant sites of recurrence. Despite the promise of ctDNA sampling, its utility in real-time genetic monitoring remains largely unexplored. METHODS: In this exploratory analysis, we characterize high-frequency ctDNA sample series collected over narrow time frames from seven patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, each undergoing treatment with Cabozantinib, a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (NCT01738438, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01738438). Applying orthogonal whole exome sequencing, ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing, and 396-gene targeted panel sequencing, we analyzed 42 plasma-derived ctDNA libraries, representing 4–8 samples per patient with 6–42 days between samples. Integrating tumor fraction, copy number, and somatic variant information, we model tumor clonal dynamics, predict neoantigens, and evaluate consistency of genomic information from orthogonal assays. RESULTS: We measured considerable variation in ctDNA tumor faction in each patient, often conflicting with RECIST imaging response metrics. In orthogonal sequencing, we found high concordance between targeted panel and whole exome sequencing in both variant detection and variant allele frequency estimation (specificity = 95.5%, VAF correlation, r = 0.949), Copy number remained generally stable, despite resolution limitations posed by low tumor fraction. Through modeling, we inferred and tracked distinct clonal populations specific to each patient and built phylogenetic trees revealing alterations in hallmark breast cancer drivers, including TP53, PIK3CA, CDK4, and PTEN. Our modeling revealed varied responses to therapy, with some individuals displaying stable clonal profiles, while others showed signs of substantial expansion or reduction in prevalence, with characteristic alterations of varied literature annotation in relation to the study drug. Finally, we predicted and tracked neoantigen-producing alterations across time, exposing translationally relevant detection patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Despite technical challenges arising from low tumor content, metastatic ctDNA monitoring can aid our understanding of response and progression, while minimizing patient risk and discomfort. In this study, we demonstrate the potential for high-frequency monitoring of evolving genomic features, providing an important step toward scalable, translational genomics for clinical decision making.

Digital interactions are also characterized by different scales, from small interest groups to large online communities. Here, we manipulate the composition of groups based on a large multi-trait profiling space (including demographic, professional, psychological and relational variables) to explore the causal link between group composition and performance as a function of group size. We asked volunteers to search news online under time pressure and measured individual and group performance in forecasting real geo-political events. Our manipulation affected the correlation of forecasts made by people after online searches. Group composition interacted with group size so that composite diversity benefited individual and group performance proportionally to group size. Aggregating opinions of modular crowds composed of small independent groups achieved better forecasts than aggregating a similar number of forecasts from non-modular ones. Finally, we show differences existing among groups in terms of disagreement, speed of convergence to consensus forecasts and within-group variability in performance. The present work sheds light on the mechanisms underlying effective online information gathering in digital environments.","Pescetelli, Niccolò; Rutherford, Alex; Rahwan, Iyad",Nat Commun,204,30

This study aimed to explore the utility of a multidisciplinary team nursing model in the clinical treatment and nursing care of patients undergoing transapical mitral valve clamping. METHODS: Our sample of ten patients included four men (40%) and six women (60%), with a mean age of 71.4 ± 5.2 years. The multidisciplinary team comprised nurses that specialized in severe illness, cardiac health, rehabilitation, psychology, nutrition, and pain. The team engaged in comprehensive discussions regarding problems specific to the patients undergoing transapical mitral valve surgery, allowing them to formulate individualized nursing measures and implement precise policies. RESULTS: No serious postoperative complications occurred in any of the ten patients included in this study, and a significant improvement was noted in the cardiac status of all the patients. Color ultrasound findings at discharge indicated that the degree of reflux of all the patients was ≤2+. Among the ten patients, the Activity of Daily Living Scale scores at discharge were significantly higher than before the operation (69.0 ± 4.6 vs. 55.0 ± 5.8). In addition, the 6-min walking test results at discharge were significantly better than those observed before the operation (318.0 ± 21.7 m vs. 295.2 ± 18.4 m). CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of a multidisciplinary team allows nurses across various specialties to provide more comprehensive and systematic care for patients undergoing a mitral valve clamping operation, thus promoting patient recovery.","Li, Sailan; Zhang, Haoruo; Chen, Meihua; Wang, Zhenzhen; Lin, Yanjuan",J Cardiothorac Surg,204,5

Using data from a cross-sectional, population-based telephone survey of 1007 working adults in Hong Kong, latent class analysis was conducted to identify socioeconomic classes within the sample. Three latent classes were identified, and they differed significantly in all the SES variables. Results suggested mental health to be the lowest in Class 1, the lowest income group. The three classes did not differ from their perceived level of job demand and control in work-related stress. Predictably, the highest income group perceived the lowest level of effort-reward imbalance. The lowest paid class was also reported perceiving the lowest level of relational justice. Different barriers to mental health services were also identified. Finally, cultural implications associated with work stress patterns, research, and practice implications are discussed. This study provides an empirical foundation for future studies to investigate patterns of job stress and mental health needs in a diverse population of working adults, with a particular focus on addressing the intersectional profiles of working adults and their needs in mental health services.","Tong, Alan C.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on 881 consecutive patients who underwent non-cardiac surgery at the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University between June 2020 and April 2021 were prospectively collected. Of these, we randomly divided 881 non-cardiac patients into two groups, training cohort (n = 617) and validation cohort (n = 264) at the ratio of 7:3. Characteristic variables were selected based on the data of training cohort through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the independent risk factors associated with PSD that then were incorporated into the nomogram. The predictive performance of the nomogram was measured by concordance index (C index), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and calibration with 1000 bootstrap samples to decrease the over-fit bias. RESULTS: PSD was found in 443 of 617 patients (71.8%) and 190 of 264 patients (72.0%) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The perioperative risk factors associated with PSD were female sex, anxiety, dissatisfaction of ward environment, absence of combined regional nerve block, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), the longer duration stayed in post anesthesia care unit (PACU), the higher dose of midazolam and sufentanil, the higher postoperative numeric rating score for pain (NRS) score. Incorporating these 9 factors, the nomogram achieved good concordance indexes of 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78–0.85) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.74–0.85) in predicting PSD in the training and validation cohorts, respectively, and obtained well-fitted calibration curves. The sensitivity and specificity (95% CIs) of the nomogram were calculated, resulting in sensitivity of 74.0% (70.0–78.2%) and 75.3% (68.4–81.7%) and specificity of 79.3% (72.5–85.2%) and 70.3% (58.4–80.7%) for the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Patients who had a nomogram score of less than 262 or 262 or greater were considered to have low or high risks of PSD presence, respectively. CONCLUSION: The proposed nomogram achieved an optimal prediction of PSD in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. The risks for an individual patient to harbor PSD can be determined by this model, which can lead to a reasonable preventive and treatment measures.","Yang, Shuting; Zhang, Qian; Xu, Yifan; Chen, Futeng; Shen, Fangming; Zhang, Qin; Liu, He; Zhang, Yueying",Nat Sci Sleep,204,5

In semantic subtyping, one defines a model of the language and an interpretation of types as subsets of this model. Subtyping is defined as inclusion of subsets denoting types. An orthogonal subtyping question, typical of object-oriented languages, is the nominal versus the structural subtyping. Dardha et al. [11, 12] defined boolean types and semantic subtyping for Featherweight Java (FJ) and integrated both nominal and structural subtyping, thus exploiting the benefits of both approaches. However, these benefits were illustrated only at a theoretical level, but not exploited practically. We present SFJ—Semantic Featherweight Java, an implementation of FJ which features boolean types, semantic subtyping and integrates nominal as well as structural subtyping. The benefits of SFJ, illustrated in the paper and the accompanying video (with audio/subtitles) [27], show how static type-checking of boolean types and semantic subtyping gives higher guarantees of program correctness, more flexibility and compactness of program writing.","Usov, Artem; Dardha, Ornela",Coordination Models and Languages,204,5

It is essential to design more specific interventions by focusing on the key determinants that may directly or indirectly influence malnutrition in India. Methods: Utilizing data from the National Family and Health Survey-4 (NFHS) (2015-16), we developed a structural equation model to find the direct, indirect, and total effect of various determinants on stunting, wasting, and underweight. We used spatial analysis to identify local occurrences of factors that are critical in controlling malnutrition. A p-value of 0.05 was considered to be significant throughout the study. Analysis was performed using STATA (version 15.1MP) and GeoDa software (version 1.14). Results: A final sample of 90, 842 children of 0–24 months of age was selected for the analysis. The CFI and TLI values of 0.98 and 0.93, respectively, are indicative of a good fit model.

Social media played a substantial awareness role in developing countries during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to analyze public opinion regarding COVID-19 and to explore the trajectory of psychological status and online public reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic by examining online content from Weibo in China. This study consisted of three steps: first, Weibo posts created during the pandemic were collected and preprocessed on a large scale; second, public sentiment orientation was classified as “optimistic/pessimistic/neutral” orientation via natural language processing and manual determination procedures; and third, qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted to reveal the trajectory of public psychological status and online public reactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Public psychological status differed in different periods of the pandemic (from December 2019 to May 2020). The newly confirmed cases had an almost 1-month lagged effect on public psychological status. Among the 15 events with high impact indexes or related to government decisions, there were 10 optimism orientation > pessimism orientation (OP) events (2/3) and 5 pessimism orientation > optimism orientation (PO) events (1/3). Among the top two OP events, the high-frequency words were “race against time” and “support,” while in the top two PO events, the high-frequency words were “irrationally purchase” and “pass away.” We proposed a hypothesis that people developed negative self-perception when they received PO events, but their cognition was developed by how these external stimuli were processed and evaluated. These results offer implications for public health policymakers on understanding public psychological status from social media. This study demonstrates the benefits of promoting psychological healthcare and hygiene activity in the early period and improving risk perception for the public based on public opinion and the coping abilities of people. Health managers should focus on disseminating socially oriented strategies to improve the policy literacy of Internet users, thereby facilitating the disease prevention work for the COVID-19 pandemic and other major public events.","Chiang, Yi-Chen; Chu, Meijie; Lin, Shengnan; Cai, Xinlan; Chen, Qing; Wang, Hongshuai; Li, An; Rui, Jia; Zhang, Xiaoke; Xie, Fang; Lee, Chun-Yang; Chen, Tianmu",Front Psychol,204,20

Studies have shown differences in behavioral strategies in risky decision-making tasks over the course of aging. The development of functional neuroimaging has gradually allowed the exploration of the neurofunctional bases of these behaviors. The purpose of our study was to carry out a meta-analysis on the neural networks underlying risky decision making in healthy older adults. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched for fMRI studies of decision making in older adults using risky decision-making tasks. To perform the quantitative meta-analysis, we used the revised version of the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm. A total of 620 references were selected for initial screening. Among these, five studies with a total of 98 cognitively normal older participants (mean age: 69.5 years) were included. The meta-analysis yielded two clusters. Main activations were found in the right insula, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Despite the limited number of studies included, our meta-analysis highlights the crucial involvement of circuits associated with both emotion regulation and the decision to act. However, in contrast to the literature on young adults, our results indicate a different pattern of hemispheric lateralization in older participants.

A total of 113 Spanish fathers with a mean age of 35.72 years (SD = 3.84 years) participated. In general, there was a decline in the dyadic adjustment of the fathers until 6-12 months after childbirth, after which their level of adjustment remained stable until 13-24 months. We observed different patterns when analyzing the evolution by subgroups formed based on these different variables, previous experience of paternity, and anxiety. The intrinsic differences between fathers should also be considered because these differences can influence the way in which men face the parental process as well as the evolution of the quality of their relationship with their partner.","Escribano, Silvia; Oliver-Roig, Antonio; Richart-Martínez, Miguel",American journal of men's health,204,8

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between October 2011 and August 2012 we treated 36 lesions (25 hepatocellular carcinoma and 11 metastases) in 30 patients aged 47-85 years (mean 67.5). Patients received ultrasound (US)-guided injection of 7 ml of naropin 0.75 % in T7, T9 and T11 levels, below the costo-vertebral ligament, until we observed an anterior displacement of the parietal pleura. For the subcapsular lesions, a cervical right phrenic nerve block was associated. The level of analgesia was evaluated during and after the percutaneous procedures with the Numerical Rating Scale. Finally, we investigated statistical correlations between pain and lesions (histological type, site, dimensions), and ablation time and technique (microwave or radiofrequency ablation). RESULTS Technical success was achieved in all patients. Despite the correct anaesthetic diffusion during the ablation, 10 patients (33.3 %) reported medium/severe pain and intravenous sedation was required. Pain was not found to correlate with any variable. No complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS In most cases, TPVB is a safe and effective technique for conscious anaesthesia during percutaneous thermal ablation of liver tumours. Failures probably derive from left sympathetic and parasympathetic fibre stimulation. We recommend performing a TPVB in the presence of the anaesthetist.","Gazzera, Carlo; Fonio, Paolo; Faletti, Riccardo; Dotto, Maria Chiara; Gobbi, Fabio; Donadio, Pierpaolo; Gandini, Giovanni",La Radiologia medica,204,12

We review how recently strengthened influenza virus surveillance in pigs has revealed that influenza virus transmission from humans to swine is far more frequent than swine-to-human zoonosis, and is central in seeding swine globally with new viral diversity. The scale of global human-to-swine transmission represents the largest 'reverse zoonosis' of a pathogen documented to date. Overcoming the bias towards perceiving swine as sources of human viruses, rather than recipients, is key to understanding how the bidirectional nature of the human-animal interface produces influenza threats to both hosts.","Nelson, Martha I; Vincent, Amy L",Trends in microbiology,204,1

The present study is aimed at systematically characterizing the circRNA expression profiles in patients with senile osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) and predicting the potential functions of the regulatory networks correlated with these differentially expressed circRNAs. Methods The circRNA expression profile in patients with senile OVCF was explored by using RNA sequencing. The prediction of the enriched signaling pathways and circRNA-miRNA networks was conducted by bioinformatics analysis. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to validate the selected differentially expressed circRNAs from 20 patients with senile OVCF relative to 20 matched healthy controls. Results A total of 884 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified, of which 554 were upregulated and 330 were downregulated. The top 15 signaling pathways associated with these differentially expressed circRNAs were predicted. The result of qRT-PCR of the selected circRNAs was consistent with RNA sequencing. Conclusions CircRNAs are differentially expressed in patients with senile OVCF, which might contribute to the pathophysiological mechanism of senile osteoporosis.","Yao, Xiaocong; Liu, Minbo; Jin, Fang; Zhu, Zhongxin",BioMed research international,204,26

Changes in IONM signals forewarn of possible neurological deficit. This real-time feedback allows for immediate alterations in therapeutic technique by the treating physician. Transcranial visual evoked potentials are not reliable for evaluating the integrity of the prechiasmatic visual system. Electroretinography (ERG) has been used in animal models for monitoring retinal ischemia and can be used in humans as well to monitor for prechiasmatic ischemia of the retinae and optic nerves. CASE DESCRIPTION We present a case where ERG signal amplitude and latency changed during ophthalmic arteriovenous fistula embolization, resulting in an intraprocedural decision to refrain from embolization of additional arterial pedicles to preserve vision. After awakening from general anesthesia, the patient had no deficits in visual acuity or field testing, but did complain of transient pain with eye movement that resolved the next day and worsened with episodes of blood pressure elevation. CONCLUSIONS ERG may be helpful for detecting prechiasmatic ischemic changes during endovascular procedures and may provide early warning signs to the surgeon before the onset of permanent retinal damage. Further investigation is needed to assess the utility of ERG monitoring during the treatment of orbital and periorbital vascular lesions.","Padalino, David J; Melnyk, Vladyslav; Allott, Geoffrey; Deshaies, Eric M",Surgical neurology international,204,27

A 16-year-old male presented with a 20 prism diopters residual right esotropia and intractable diplopia following Surgery and Botulinum Toxin. Having had further BT and surgery ruled out and no success with Fresnel prisms or occlusion, he commenced on standard orthoptic exercises without success. Additional orthoptic assessment discovered that the patient could achieve binocular single vision (BSV) on convergence at 10 cm. The patient then proceeded on a course of exercises to help extend this area of BSV. These exercises included a reverse dot card and a variation of the distance cat stereogram. Over the next couple of visits, the area of binocularity was extended to 30 cm and the esotropia measured 18 prism diopters. However, the patient felt that progress was slow, and they were keen to learn to drive and so opted for an occlusive contact lens instead. It is unfortunate that the patient did not continue with the exercise program as it showed potential to increase his area of BSV. However, this case does demonstrate how utilizing current knowledge concepts of both exercises and BSV, and adapting them to a specific patient could lead to improvement in the likes of intractable diplopia and be a potential management option.","Budd, Adam",Strabismus,204,4

This study is aimed at exploring the association of leptin gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with susceptibility to RA in a Chinese population. Methods We recruited 600 RA patients and 600 healthy controls from a Chinese population and analyzed their three leptin SNPs (rs10244329, rs2071045, and rs2167270) using the improved Multiplex Ligase Detection Reaction (iMLDR) assays. The associations of these SNPs with clinical manifestations of RA were also analyzed. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed for plasma leptin determination. Results No significant difference in either allele or genotype frequencies of these three SNPs between RA patients and healthy controls was observed (all P > 0.05). Association between the genotype effects of dominant, recessive models was also not found (all P > 0.05). No significant difference in plasma leptin levels was detected between RA patients and controls (P > 0.05).

It easily accumulates in organisms and is transmitted along the food chain or food web for long distances and long periods of time. The experiment was designed to assess the TBBPA pollution levels in marine environments via environmental sample testing and risk assessment. TBBPA levels in seawater and zooplankton samples at each station (n = 38) were detected, whereafter the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) and risk quotient (RQ) were calculated to evaluate the potential bioaccumulation and ecological risk of TBBPA to zooplankton, respectively. The results showed that TBBPA was widely detected in surface seawater and zooplankton samples in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, with levels ranging from ND (non-detected) to 0.46 μg/L and ND to 9.83 μg/kg (wet weight), respectively. In both the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, the distance from the shore was one of the main factors affecting the TBBPA concentration in seawater, regardless of visibility. The BAF was significantly correlated with the TBBPA content in zooplankton samples (P < 0.01), which ranged from 372.32 to 29,941.55, indicating that TBBPA exhibits an obvious bioaccumulation risk to marine zooplankton. The ecological risk assessment indicated that TBBPA levels in seawater pose a high ecotoxicity risk to zooplankton (RQ > 1). This finding suggests that both the significant bioaccumulation of TBBPA in marine ecosystems and its potential ecological risks cannot be ignored.","Gong, Wenjing; Wang, Junjian; Cui, Wen; Zhu, Liyan",Environmental geochemistry and health,204,31

However, in some cases, flow diversion may still be the preferred treatment option. This study sought to determine whether geometric factors pertaining to relative size and angulation of branch vessel(s) can be measured in a reliable fashion and whether they are related to occlusion rates. METHODS Eighty aneurysms treated at a single neurovascular center from November 2008 to June 2014 were identified. Two blinded raters prospectively reviewed the imaging performed at the time of the procedure and measured the following geometric variables: inflow jet/incorporated branch direction angle and branch artery/ parent artery ratio. Delayed occlusion was defined as the absence of complete aneurysmal occlusion at one year. Analysis was performed using logistic regression and intra-class correlation co-efficient (ICC). RESULTS Twenty-four (30%) aneurysms with 28 incorporated branches were identified. A trend toward higher inflow jet/incorporated branch direction angle was found in the group of aneurysms demonstrating delayed occlusion when compared to the group with complete occlusion. ICC revealed high correlation. Overall lower one-year occlusion rates of 53% versus 73% for aneurysms with and without incorporated branches, respectively, were also noted. CONCLUSIONS The presence of an incorporated branch conferred a 20% absolute risk increase for delayed aneurysmal occlusion. Incorporated branches with a larger angle between the inflow jet and the incorporated branch direction exhibited a trend toward lower occlusion rates. This might be further investigated using a multicenter approach in conjunction with other potentially relevant clinical and angiographic variables.","Zetchi, M Akli; Dmytriw, Adam A; Chiu, Albert H; Drake, Brian J; Alizadeh, Niki V; Bharatha, Aditya; Kulkarni, Abhaya V; Marotta, Thomas R","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",204,27

In this study, we present an empirical work for assessing ecological responses with botanical legacy data in the Qilian Mountains of China. Plot-scale and transect-wide survey was conducted for alpine shrub communities along an elevational gradient 20 years ago. Recently, we resampled the permanent plots to investigate how the community changes may be linked to climatic variability. We found no significant temporal shifts in species richness; but the community structure underwent substantial changes, as indicated by visible shifts in the relative density of dominant shrub species and the frequency of occurrence of understory herbaceous species. This reshuffling of plant community composition reflected a series of complex responses to climate change. Specifically, wet-demanding species have become more frequent due to the recently enhanced precipitation, while the replacement of some low-statured plants with different requirements for light was indirectly regulated by climate warming via reshaping the altitudinal patterns of dominant shrubs. Climate-mediated shifts in shrub species distribution altered the expected evolutional trajectory of alpine community, which increased the complexity and nonlinearity of the responses of the communities at different altitudes to climatic variability. Our results suggested that in-depth knowledge of indirect effects can facilitate to lessen the uncertainty in predicting future community dynamics in a changing climate.","Du, Jun; He, Zhibin; Chen, Longfei; Lin, Pengfei; Zhu, Xi; Tian, Quanyan",International journal of biometeorology,204,12

Understanding of these fundamental processes, however, has been largely constrained by limited access to fetal brain tissue and the inability to prospectively study neurodevelopment in humans at the molecular, cellular and system levels. Although non-human model organisms have provided important insights into mechanisms underlying brain development, these systems do not fully recapitulate many human-specific features that often relate to disease. To address these challenges, human brain organoids, self-assembled three-dimensional neural aggregates, have been engineered from human pluripotent stem cells to model the architecture and cellular diversity of the developing human brain. Recent advancements in neural induction and regional patterning using small molecules and growth factors have yielded protocols for generating brain organoids that recapitulate the structure and neuronal composition of distinct brain regions. Here, we first provide an overview of early mammalian brain development with an emphasis on molecular cues that guide region specification. We then focus on recent efforts in generating human brain organoids that model the development of specific brain regions and highlight endeavors to enhance the cellular complexity to better mimic the in vivo developing human brain. We also provide examples of how organoid models have enhanced our understanding of human neurological diseases and conclude by discussing limitations of brain organoids with our perspectives on future advancements to maximize their potential.","Jacob, Fadi; Schnoll, Jordan G; Song, Hongjun; Ming, Guo-Li",Current topics in developmental biology,204,1

So, it was hypothesized that this increase is related with the situation of economic crisis. This study aimed to investigate if the correlation between unemployment rates and the incidence of depression is maintained in the post-crisis period of economic recovery in Portugal (2016 - 2018). MATERIAL AND METHODS An ecological study was carried out, using data from the General Practitioners Sentinel Network concerning depression incidence (first episodes and relapses) and data from the National Statistics Institute on unemployment rates in the Portuguese population. The correlation coefficient was estimated using linear regression and the results were disaggregated by sex. RESULTS Between 2016 and 2018, there was a consistent decrease in the incidence of depression in both sexes. During the 1995 - 2018 period, a positive correlation was observed between unemployment and depression, with a coefficient of 0.833 (p = 0.005) in males and of 0.742 (p = 0.022) in females. DISCUSSION The reduction in the incidence of depression in both sexes observed between 2016 - 2018 corroborates a positive correlation between unemployment and depression in the Portuguese population, previously observed between 2007 - 2013. CONCLUSION This study highlights the need to monitor the occurrence of mental illness in the Portuguese population, especially in moments of greatest social vulnerability in order to establish preventive measures, as a way to mitigate the impact of future economic crises.","Coelho, Inês Laplanche; Sousa-Uva, Mafalda; Pina, Nuno; Marques, Sara; Matias-Dias, Carlos; Rodrigues, Ana Paula",Acta medica portuguesa,204,1

We tested a hypothesis that endotension may be from a type Ia endoleak pressurizing the aneurysm sac, without net forward flow, not visualized on standard angiographic imaging. METHODS A patient-specific aortic aneurysm phantom was constructed of polyvinyl alcohol using three-dimensional molding techniques. A bifurcated stent graft was implanted, and the phantom was connected to a hemodynamic simulator for testing. Type Ia endoleaks were created using 7F catheters. Three scenarios were studied: complete exclusion (no endoleak), inflow with no sac outflow, and inflow with sac outflow. Imaging with digital subtraction angiography was performed at 48 kVp at 5 frames/s, followed by delayed imaging at 1 frame/min for 30 minutes. RESULTS With no endoleak, the systemic pressure averaged 113 mm Hg and aneurysm sac pressure averaged 101 mm Hg. With an endoleak present without outflow, the systemic pressure averaged 116 mm Hg, the aneurysm sac pressure averaged 120 mm Hg, and endoleak flow was bidirectional with no net forward flow. With endoleak present with aneurysm sac outflow, the systemic pressure averaged 119 mm Hg, aneurysm sac pressure averaged 105.5 mm Hg, and net endoleak flow into the aneurysm sac was 21 mL/min across the endoleak channel. With digital subtraction imaging, the endoleak with no outflow was noted after >9 minutes of delayed imaging. CONCLUSIONS In our model, the creation of a type Ia endoleak in the absence of sac outflow resulted in a mean pressure higher than the systemic mean pressure with zero net flow into the aneurysm sac. Consequently, the endoleak could only be visualized with markedly delayed imaging and not with standard contrast digital subtraction angiography like that used in clinical practice. Our findings suggest that endotension may in fact be the result of undetected endoleaks secondary to the limitations of present iodinated contrast imaging modalities.","Blackwood, Stuart; Mix, Doran; Chandra, Ankur; Dietzek, Alan M",Journal of vascular surgery,204,1

The aim of this study was to examine the patency of the posterior fossa dural sinuses in patients with vein of Galen malformation and to analyze the clinical and angiographic course of this condition. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 61 consecutive children with vein of Galen malformations. Clinical presentation, management, outcome, and angiographic change were analyzed for the patients with attention paid to all dural sinus occlusions. RESULTS Twenty patients (32.8%) demonstrated spontaneous sinus occlusion, mostly in the sigmoid sinus. This condition was not observed in neonates and was first discovered during infancy or childhood. Progression of sinus occlusion was seen in 10 patients, and the conditions of 6 of them deteriorated in accordance with the progression of sinus occlusion. After total or subtotal obliteration of the malformation by transarterial glue embolization, 13 patients recovered to healthy, 3 patients had only mild developmental delay, and 4 patients remained neurologically disabled. CONCLUSIONS Spontaneous sinus occlusion is not a rare condition and can result in neurologic deterioration in the natural history of untreated vein of Galen malformation. If signs of progressive sinus occlusion are noticed, early arteriovenous shunt reduction or elimination by transarterial glue embolization is expected to prevent permanent brain damage.","Berenstein, A; Toma, N; Niimi, Y; Paramasivam, S",AJNR.

Significant impact of climate change is seen in the form of rise in temperature called as global warming. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the primary greenhouse gases (GHGs) mainly responsible for the global warming and climate change. These GHGs have drawn lot of attention due to their significant role in the global warming potential. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested to stop global warming at 1.5oC above preindustrial levels as warming beyond this level might lead to heat extremes, alter insect and plant phenology (Phenological shifts) and more occurrence of vector borne diseases. Climate change is the topic of interest in all fields of life starting from social science and going to the applied science. Global climate cycles and world food production systems are under threat due to the recent climate extreme events. These events include heat waves and change in the rainfall patterns. Thus, risk reduction intervention in the form of mitigation and adaptation is required to minimize the impacts of climate change. Mitigation option includes understanding the present and future components of the climate system and interaction among them through coupled modeling system i.e. Global Circulation Model (GCM). Finally, global issue of climate change could be addressed by taking worldwide cooperation and action and adopting sustainable measures like use of alternative energy sources. The visible benefit on recovery of climate has been seen recently through global lockdown against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Ahmed, Mukhtar",The Science of the total environment,204,1

METHODS An optical mark recognition/optical character recognition (OMR/OCR) system was developed to identify fields that were selected on 2,814 paper assessment forms, each with 141 fields which were used to assess potential COVID-19 infections. A novel user interface (UI) displayed mirrored forms showing the scanned assessment forms with OMR results superimposed on the left and an editable web form on the right to improve ease of data validation. Crowdsourced participants validated the results of the OMR system. Overall error rate and time taken to validate were calculated. A subset of forms was validated by multiple participants to calculate agreement between participants. RESULTS The OMR/OCR tools correctly extracted data from scanned forms fields with an average accuracy of 70% and median accuracy of 78% when the OMR/OCR results were compared with the results from crowd validation. Scanned forms were crowd-validated at a mean rate of 157 seconds per document and a volume of approximately 108 documents per day. A randomly selected subset of documents was reviewed by multiple participants, producing an interobserver agreement of 97% for documents when narrative-text fields were included and 98% when only Boolean and multiple-choice fields were considered. CONCLUSION Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be challenging for health care workers wearing personal protective equipment to interact with electronic health records. The combination of OMR/OCR technology, a novel UI, and crowdsourcing data-validation processes allowed for the efficient extraction of a large volume of paper medical documents produced during the COVID-19 pandemic.","White-Dzuro, Colin G; Schultz, Jacob D; Ye, Cheng; Coco, Joseph R; Myers, Janet M; Shackelford, Claude; Rosenbloom, S Trent; Fabbri, Daniel",Applied clinical informatics,204,1

We investigate the association between food insecurity severity and mental illnesses in a nationally representative youth sample. METHODS We sampled 55 700 youth 12-24 years from recent cycles of Canadian Community Health Survey. Household food insecurity was measured using a standard 18-item questionnaire. We fitted Poisson regressions on self-rated mental health and diagnosed mood and anxiety disorders, controlling for sociodemographic confounders. Clinical assessments of emotional distress, major depression and suicidal ideation were examined in subsamples with available data. We stratified the sample by gender, age and survey cycle to test potential demographic heterogeneity. RESULTS One in seven youth lived in marginal (5.30%), moderate (8.08%) or severe (1.44%) food insecurity. Results showed that food insecurity was associated with higher likelihood of every mental health problem examined. The association was graded, with more severe food insecurity linked to progressively worse mental health. Notably, marginal, moderate and severe food insecurity were associated with 1.77, 2.44 and 6.49 times higher risk of suicidal thoughts, respectively. The corresponding relative risk for mood disorders were 1.57, 2.00 and 2.89; those for anxiety disorders were 1.41, 1.65 and 2.58. Moderate food insecurity was more closely associated with mental health problems in 18-24 year olds than in 12-17 year olds. CONCLUSIONS Food insecurity severity was associated with poorer mental health among Canadian youth independent of household income and other socioeconomic differences. Targeted policy intervention alleviating food insecurity may improve youth mental health.","Men, Fei; Elgar, Frank J; Tarasuk, Valerie",Journal of epidemiology and community health,204,16

We report a case of a prolonged persistence of viable SARS-CoV-2 associated with clinical relapses of COVID-19 in a lymphoma patient. MethodsNasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by Real time-PCR (RT-PCR). On five positive nasopharyngeal swabs, we performed viral culture and next generation sequencing. We analysed the patients adaptive and innate immunity to characterize T and NK cell subsets. FindingsSARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs samples remained positive with cycle threshold mean values of 22 {+/-} 1{middle dot}3 for over 8 months. All five performed viral cultures were positive and genomic analysis confirmed a persistent infection with the same strain. Viremia resulted positive in three out of four COVID-19 clinical relapses and cleared each time after remdesivir treatment. T and NK cells dynamic was different in aviremic and viremic samples and no SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were detected throughout the disease course. InterpretationIn our patient, SARS-CoV-2 persisted with proven infectivity for over eight months. Viremia was associated with COVID-19 relapses and remdesivir treatment was effective in viremia clearance and symptoms remission, although it was unable to clear the virus from the upper respiratory airways. During the viremic phase, we observed a low frequency of terminal effector CD8+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood that are probably recruited in inflammatory tissue for viral eradication. In addition we found a high level of NK cells repertoire perturbation with a relevant involvement during SARS-CoV-2 viremia.

METHODS In 2006, randomly selected employees (n = 549) of a hospital in Beijing were surveyed concerning their exposure to the 2003 SARS outbreak, and the ways in which the outbreak had affected their mental health. RESULTS About 10% of the respondents had experienced high levels of posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms since the SARS outbreak. Respondents who had been quarantined, or worked in high-risk locations such as SARS wards, or had friends or close relatives who contracted SARS, were 2 to 3 times more likely to have high PTS symptom levels, than those without these exposures. Respondents' perceptions of SARS-related risks were significantly positively associated with PTS symptom levels and partially mediated the effects of exposure. Altruistic acceptance of work-related risks was negatively related to PTS levels. CONCLUSIONS The psychological impact of stressful events related to an infectious disease outbreak may be mediated by peoples' perceptions of those events; altruism may help to protect some health care workers against these negative impacts.","Wu, Ping; Fang, Yunyun; Guan, Zhiqiang; Fan, Bin; Kong, Junhui; Yao, Zhongling; Liu, Xinhua; Fuller, Cordelia J; Susser, Ezra; Lu, Jin; Hoven, Christina W",Canadian journal of psychiatry.

FTA paper is a cotton-based cellulose membrane containing lyophilized chemicals that lyses many types of bacteria and viruses. IBV was inactivated upon contact with the FTA, as shown by the inability of the virus to be propagated in embryonating chicken eggs. RT-PCR of the S1 gene showed that viral RNA in allantoic fluid remained stable after storage on FTA filter cards and that the stability was time and temperature sensitive for the large (1700 base pair [bp]) but not the small (383 bp) PCR products. Analysis of the amplified products showed that molecular characterization is feasible in allantoic fluid stored on FTA under nonfavorable environmental conditions (41 C) for at least 15 days. The use of FTA cards for the collection, transport, and storage of IBV-containing samples is safe, inexpensive, and adequate for molecular diagnosis. We propose that specimens coming from overseas on FTA cards would be first analyzed by RT-PCR with primers yielding a 1700-bp product followed by RFLP of the positive cases. Negative cases would be analyzed with primers yielding a 383-bp product (to exdude detrimental effect of the storage conditions) followed by nucleotide sequencing of the positive cases.","Moscoso, Hugo; Raybon, Erine O; Thayer, Stephan G; Hofacre, Charles L",Avian diseases,204,26

The objective of this article is to better understand their functioning. METHOD We format a non-systematic literature review concerning these recommendations. RESULTS The implementation of these Brief Interventions programs in primary care is relevant due to the moderately positive impact on the frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption but both the quality of the therapeutic relationship and collaboration with the care network would optimize Brief Interventions. The quality of the therapeutic relationship alone appears to have an impact on therapeutic outcome.

Anxiety levels and risk factors within particular populations are poorly described. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate confidence, understanding, trust, concerns, and levels of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population and assess risk factors for increased anxiety. METHODS: We launched a cross-sectional online survey of a large Russian population between April 6 and 15, 2020, using multiple social media platforms. A set of questions targeted confidence, understanding, trust, and concerns in respondents. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure anxiety. Multiple linear regressions were used to model predictors of COVID-19-related anxiety. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 23,756 out of 53,966 (44.0% response rate) unique visitors; of which, 21,364 were residing in 62 areas of Russia. State Anxiety Scale (S-Anxiety) scores were higher than Trait Anxiety Scale scores across all regions of Russia (median S-Anxiety score 52, IQR 44-60), exceeding published norms. Time spent following news on COVID-19 was strongly associated with an increased S-Anxiety adjusted for baseline anxiety level. One to two hours spent reading COVID-19 news was associated with a 5.46 (95% CI 5.03-5.90) point difference, 2-3 hours with a 7.06 (95% CI 6.37-7.74) point difference, and more than three hours with an 8.65 (95% CI 7.82-9.47) point difference, all compared to less than 30 minutes per day. Job loss during the pandemic was another important factor associated with higher S-Anxiety scores (3.95, 95% CI 3.31-4.58). Despite survey respondents reporting high confidence in information regarding COVID-19 as well as an understanding of health care guidance, they reported low overall trust in state and local authorities, and perception of country readiness. CONCLUSIONS: Among Russian respondents from multiple social media platforms, there was evidence of higher levels of state anxiety associated with recent job loss and increased news consumption, as well as lower than expected trust in government agencies. These findings can help inform the development of key public health messages to help reduce anxiety and raise perceived trust in governmental response to this current national emergency. Using a similar methodology, comparative surveys are ongoing in other national populations.","Nekliudov, Nikita A; Blyuss, Oleg; Cheung, Ka Yan; Petrou, Loukia; Genuneit, Jon; Sushentsev, Nikita; Levadnaya, Anna; Comberiati, Pasquale; Warner, John O; Tudor-Williams, Gareth; Teufel, Martin; Greenhawt, Matthew; DunnGalvin, Audrey; Munblit, Daniel",J Med Internet Res,204,24

Insomnia is common in patients with COVID-19 admitted to mobile cabin hospitals. Insomnia may lead to immune dysfunction, a condition not conducive to recovery from COVID-19. The use of sedative-hypnotic drugs is limited by their inhibitory effect on the respiratory system. A paucity of research is available regarding psychotherapy interventions to improve insomnia symptoms among patients with COVID-19. In the general population, sleep problems are more common in women than in men; insomnia in women patients requires special attention. The aim of this study was to develop simplified-cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (S-CBTI) for patients with COVID-19 and comorbid insomnia symptoms and to verify its effectiveness through a self-control trial. A second aim was to compare the effectiveness of S-CBTI between acute and chronic insomnia among women with COVID-19 and comorbid insomnia symptoms in Wuhan Jianghan Cabin Hospital. METHODS: S-CBTI consisted of education on COVID-19 and sleep hygiene, stimulus control, sleep restriction, and self-suggestion relaxation training over a period of two consecutive weeks. Of 67 women, 66 completed psychological intervention and baseline and post-intervention assessments. There were 31 women with acute insomnia and 35 with chronic insomnia. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score and self-compiled sleep data were assessed at baseline and post-intervention, and subjective sleep evaluations were assessed at days 4, 7, 12, and 14. RESULTS: The ISI score, sleep latency, night sleep time, and sleep efficiency were statistically significantlly improved from baseline to post-intervention by paired T-test. After the intervention, the mean ISI score of the acute insomnia group was lower than that of the chronic insomnia group. The reduction of the ISI score and the improvement of sleep time from baseline to post-intervention in the acute insomnia group were greater than those in the chronic insomnia group. Utilization of sedative-hypnotic drugs in the acute insomnia group was less than that in the chronic insomnia group, and the difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: S-CBTI can improve the insomnia symptoms of women with COVID-19 in mobile cabin hospitals, especially for stress-related acute insomnia.","He, Jin; Yang, Lei; Pang, Jianyue; Dai, Lingling; Zhu, Jiaojiao; Deng, Yajie; He, Yi; Li, Hengfen",Sleep breath,204,23

Patients with underlying metabolic dysfunction, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, are at a higher risk for COVID-19 complications, including multi-organ dysfunction, secondary to a deranged immune response, and cellular energy deprivation. These patients are at a baseline state of chronic inflammation associated with increased susceptibility to the severe immune manifestations of COVID-19, which are triggered by the cellular hypoxic environment and cytokine storm. The altered metabolic profile and energy generation of immune cells affect their activation, exacerbating the imbalanced immune response. Key immunometabolic interactions may inform the development of an efficacious treatment for COVID-19. Novel therapeutic approaches with repurposed drugs, such as PPAR agonists, or newly developed molecules such as the antagomirs, which block microRNA function, have shown promising results.

Discussion: Parasitic infections are more frequent in the developing countries; in our case the transposition of small intestinal loop surely promoted the migration of Taenia Saginata throught the gastro-jejunal anastomosis into the gastric stump.Preoperative evaluation (history, physical examination and imaging features) led to gastric cancer diagnosis and hindered the recognition of the taeniasis because of similar clinical presentations and the need to start quickly a therapeutic oncological strategy.

Here, we analyse the supply-chain effects of a set of idealized lockdown scenarios, using the latest global trade modelling framework. We find that supply-chain losses that are related to initial COVID-19 lockdowns are largely dependent on the number of countries imposing restrictions and that losses are more sensitive to the duration of a lockdown than its strictness. However, a longer containment that can eradicate the disease imposes a smaller loss than shorter ones. Earlier, stricter and shorter lockdowns can minimize overall losses. A 'go-slow' approach to lifting restrictions may reduce overall damages if it avoids the need for further lockdowns. Regardless of the strategy, the complexity of global supply chains will magnify losses beyond the direct effects of COVID-19. Thus, pandemic control is a public good that requires collective efforts and support to lower-capacity countries.","Guan, Dabo; Wang, Daoping; Hallegatte, Stephane; Davis, Steven J; Huo, Jingwen; Li, Shuping; Bai, Yangchun; Lei, Tianyang; Xue, Qianyu; Coffman, D039; Maris,; Cheng, Danyang; Chen, Peipei; Liang, Xi; Xu, Bing; Lu, Xiaosheng; Wang, Shouyang; Hubacek, Klaus; Gong, Peng",Nat Hum Behav,204,16

Four databases including Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Scopus were searched for studies published from 2019-Jan-01 to 2020-April-03. Data analysis and drawing of charts were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software Version 2.2 (Biostat, USA). The search yielded 450 publications, of which 64 potentially eligible studies were identified for full-text review and 21 studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria remained. A total of 4191 COVID-19 patients were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of liver injury was 19.5% (95% CI: 14.3-26.1). According to our results, there was significant heterogeneity among the 19 studies (X2 = 738.5; p < 0.001; I2 = 94.34%). Among 288 death cases, the pooled prevalence of liver injury was 22.8% (95% CI: 11.7-39.8). In summary, the COVID-19 disease itself can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases and even may lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure. The results of this systematic review highlight the importance of liver injury that may assist clinicians anywhere in the globe in controlling COVID-19-related infection and complications. Moreover, the prevalence of liver injury can be higher in severe cases than in mild cases.","Samidoust, Pirouz; Samidoust, Aryan; Samadani, Ali Akbar; Khoshdoz, Sara",Infez Med,204,1

While published guidelines provide suggestions on which cases are appropriate for treatment delay, there are no good quantitative estimates on the association of delays with tumor control or risk of new metastases. Objectives: To develop a simplified mathematical model of tumor growth, control, and new metastases for cancers with varying doubling times and metastatic potential and to estimate tumor control probability (TCP) and metastases risk as a function of treatment delay interval. Design, Setting, and Participants: This decision analytical model describes a quantitative model for 3 tumors (ie, head and neck, colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancers). Using accepted ranges of tumor doubling times and metastatic development from the clinical literature from 2001 to 2020, estimates of tumor growth, TCP, and new metastases were analyzed for various treatment delay intervals. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk estimates for potential decreases in local TCP and increases in new metastases with each interval of treatment delay. Results: For fast-growing head and neck tumors with a 2-month treatment delay, there was an estimated 4.8% (95% CI, 3.4%-6.4%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 0.49% (0.47%-0.51%) increase in new distal metastases risk. A 6-month delay was associated with an estimated 21.3% (13.4-30.4) increase in local tumor control risk and a 6.0% (5.2-6.8) increase in distal metastases risk. For intermediate-growing colorectal tumors, there was a 2.1% (0.7%-3.5%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 2.7% (2.6%-2.8%) increase in distal metastases risk at 2 months and a 7.6% (2.2%-14.2%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 24.7% (21.9%-27.8%) increase in distal metastases risk at 6 months. For slower-growing lung tumors, there was a 1.2% (0.0%-2.8%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 0.19% (0.18%-0.20%) increase in distal metastases risk at 2 months, and a 4.3% (0.0%-10.6%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 1.9% (1.6%-2.2%) increase in distal metastases risk at 6 months. Conclusions and Relevance: This study proposed a model to quantify the association of treatment delays with local tumor control and risk of new metastases. The detrimental associations were greatest for tumors with faster rates of proliferation and metastasis. The associations were smaller, but still substantial, for slower-growing tumors.","Ng, John; Stovezky, Yael R; Brenner, David J; Formenti, Silvia C; Shuryak, Igor",JAMA Netw Open,204,33

It is caused by imprinting defect of the GNAS gene and is acquired as autosomal dominant. Compared with Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a (PHP1a), PHP1b does not have the characteristic physical features know as Albright hereditary osteodystrophy or AHO. Results: 12-year-old female with unremarkable past medical history presented with seizures. She has been complaining of leg pain for a week but on the day of presentation noted to have stiffening and shortness of breath. There was no history of cough, fever, leg trauma, headache, dysuria, hematuria or dark urine. She had no significant family history. Work up revealed severe hypocalcemia of 4.6 mg/ dL and elevated phosphorus (7.1mg/dl). There was no hypoglycemia and other electrolytes including renal function were normal. Patient also had normal inflammatory markers, normal fibrinogen, and normal ferritin. Urine was positive for trace protein and was positive for myoglobin. Alkaline phosphatase was normal. Urine toxicology screen was negative. Hand X-rays did not showed the shortening of metacarpal bones and kidney ultrasound was normal. After IV calcium bolus, calcium barely increased at 5.0. Interestingly CK was noted to be elevated at 3,794 U/L. Patient physical exam was normal and there was no signs of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO). Patient was positive for COVID19. Patient required intensive fluid therapy to correct CK which increased up to 11,223 U/L on 3rd day of admission. It eventually came down back to normal on the 6th day. Creatinine levels remained normal. Patient continued to receive high dose calcium and calcitriol supplement and discharged with calcium of 8.5 mg/dL and phosphorus of 7.8 mg/dL. Additional work up showed PTH of 885 pg/mL consistent with pseudohypoparathyroidism. Vitamin D levels and thyroid function were normal. Genetic testing for pseudohypoparathyroidism is awaited. Conclusion: Psuedohypoparathyroidism type 1 b (PHP 1b) is a rare endocrine disorder presenting with hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and increased PTH values due to a variable resistance to target organs. As in our case it was unmasked by COVID 19 infection and rhabdomyolysis. Best of our knowledge there is no such unusual case reported in children. Severe hypocalcemia likely due to combination of factors including tissue calcium deposition, hyperphosphatemia, and skeletal resistance to PTH. As published in some recent reports, this case also illustrates that rhabdomyolysis could be potential complication of SARS- CoV2 infection in early stage with normal renal function, which warrants further research.","Chan, Jacqueline Mansuri Asif",Journal of the Endocrine Society,204,16

We describe an otherwise healthy 30-year-old woman who developed thrombocytopenia, ecchymosis, portal vein thrombosis, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis the second week after she received the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Extensive diagnostic workup for thrombosis predispositions showed heterozygosity for the prothrombin mutation, but no evidence of myeloproliferative neoplasia or infectious or autoimmune diseases. Her only temporary risk factor was long-term use of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). Although both the prothrombin mutation and use of OCPs predispose to portal and cerebral vein thrombosis, the occurrence of multiple thromboses within a short time and the associated pattern of thrombocytopenia and consumption coagulopathy are highly unusual.

In hospitals this leads to poor patient flow and nosocomial transmission and so rapid, accurate diagnostic tests are urgently required. The FebriDx is a point-of-care test that detects an antiviral host response protein in finger prick blood within 10 min, but its accuracy for the identification of COVID-19 is unknown. METHODS: We performed a real-world diagnostic accuracy study of FebriDx in hospitalised patients during the first wave of the pandemic. Measures of diagnostic accuracy were calculated based on FebriDx results compared to the reference standard of SARS-CoV-2 PCR on combined nose and throat swabs. A multivariable predictive model including FebriDx, age, sex, and clinical characteristics was developed and underwent internal validation. RESULTS: FebriDx was performed on 251 patients and gave a valid result in 248. 118 of 248 (48%) were PCR positive for COVID-19. FebriDx results were available after 10 min compared with 1.7 (1.6 to 2.1) hours with point-of-care PCR testing and 23.4 (17.2 to 31.1) hours with laboratory PCR testing. Sensitivity of FebriDx for the identification of COVID-19 was 93% (110/118; 95% CI 87 to 97%) and specificity was 86% (112/130; 95%CI 79 to 92%). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 6.73 (95%CI 4.37 to 10.37) and 0.08 (95%CI 0.04 to 0.15) respectively. In the multivariate model age, sex and other clinical features did not contribute significantly to the effect of the FebriDx result in distinguishing patients with and without COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave of the pandemic, FebriDx had high accuracy for the identification of COVID-19 in hospitalised adults and could be deployed as a front door triage tool.

Although the excessively stringent regulation effectively slowed the spread of the disease, it might have challenged the well-being of the residents. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the effect of the residential lockdown on subjective well-being (SWB) of individuals during COVID-19. METHODS: The sample consisted of 1,790 lockdown residents (73.18% female) and 3,580 non-lockdown residents (gender matched with 1,790 lockdown residents) on Sina Weibo. In both the lockdown and non-lockdown groups, we calculated the SWB indicators during the 2 weeks before and after the enforcement date of the residential lockdown, using individuals' original posts on Sina Weibo. This calculation of SWB was via online ecological recognition (OER), which was based on established machine-learning predictive models. RESULTS: The time (before the residential lockdown, after the residential lockdown) × area (lockdown, non-lockdown) interactions in integral analysis (N = 5370) showed that after the residential lockdown, compared with non-lockdown group, the lockdown group scored lower in some negative SWB indicators, including somatization (F(1, 5368) = 13.593, P < .001) and paranoid ideation (F(1, 5368) = 14.333, P < .001). The time (before the residential lockdown, after the residential lockdown) × area (developed, under-developed) interactions in the comparison of the residential lockdown areas with different economic development (N = 1790) indicated that the SWB of residents in under-developed areas showed no significant change after the residential lockdown (P > .05) while those in developed areas changed. CONCLUSIONS: These findings increase the understanding of the psychological impact and cost of residential lockdown during the epidemic. The more negative changes in residents' SWB in developed areas imply greater demand of psychological intervention under residential lockdown.","Wang, Yilin; Wu, Peijing; Liu, Xiaoqian; Li, Sijia; Zhu, Tingshao; Zhao, Nan",J. med. internet res,204,14

Despite the global frequency of civil unrest, its effect on NGOs' programmatic, administrative, and operational capabilities is poorly understood. To this end, we completed in-depth semi-structured interviews with eight key informants representing seven health NGOs in Nicaragua several months after widespread and persistent civil unrest erupted in April 2018. Data analysis revealed that all NGOs experienced notable disruptions in community education and health promotion, healthcare provision, fundraising, and strategic planning. Further, NGOs experienced several key challenges in responding to crises, including mobility within and between communities, diminishing financial resources, and safety concerns for staff and volunteers. Several NGOs anticipated long-term adverse impacts. In light of these challenges, we propose that health NGOs create a plan of action to mitigate adverse impacts of civil unrest and promote population health. Specifically, a plan of action should address institutional planning, communication strategies, and partnerships and coalitions. We also propose important ways in which future research could build on this preliminary study.","Hartmann, Chris; Hartmann, Jennifer M K; Lopez, Alexis; Flores, Paola",Glob Public Health,204,20

Clearly, one can see the need to develop new, more effective, antimicrobial agents that go beyond the explored 'chemical space'. In this regard, their unique modes of action (e.g., reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, redox activation, ligand exchange, depletion of substrates involved in vital cellular processes) render metal complexes as promising drug candidates. Several Ru (II/III) complexes have been included in, or are currently undergoing, clinical trials as anticancer agents. Based on the in-depth knowledge of their chemical properties and biological behavior, the interest in developing new ruthenium compounds as antibiotic, antifungal, antiparasitic, or antiviral drugs has risen. This review will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Ru (II/III) frameworks as antimicrobial agents. Some aspects regarding the relationship between their chemical structure and mechanism of action, cellular localization, and/or metabolism of the ruthenium complexes in bacterial and eukaryotic cells are discussed as well. Regarding the antiviral activity, in light of current events related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ru (II/III) compounds used against SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., BOLD-100) are also reviewed herein.

The study aims to assess SMN use for acquiring health care information and publics' perception of virtual encounters with pharmacists for health- related purposes particularly in times of a pandemic crisis. Methods Cross-sectional survey that was distributed on 2017 (phase 1) was again distributed during the pandemic (phase 2). Results On phase 1 and phase 2 we collected 566 and 409 respondents respectively. Most used SMN in both phases were Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram. In both phases respondents preferred acquiring health care information by going physically to the hospital or pharmacy, however virtual interactions were only accepted by (14%) in phase 1 compared to (36%) in phase 2. Additionally, while only 15% said would “definitely” reach a pharmacist virtually in phase 1, 50% said they would in phase 2. In phase 2, 90% follow the Saudi Ministry of Health website, while 41% follow verified doctors for acquiring medical health-care information. Virtual contact with a pharmacist was mostly (76%) for medical consultation. Conclusion This study is the first to shed light on society's acceptance and perception of an innovative educational tool taken by the pharmacist through social media and virtual portals among the Saudi population in Jeddah. There's an opportunity for Medication Therapy Management (MTM), CMR, medication refill, and disease follow up that the pharmacist can take the lead in if properly implemented. Future studies should look into safe and reliable ways to make use of social media networks as well as virtual tools to expand public health awareness especially in a highly technology dependent society.","Badr, Aisha F.; Ismail, Ghady A.; Alghuraybi, Rawan H.; Lahza, Raghad Z.",Saudi Pharmaceutical Journal,204,16

This can be explained partly by intratumor heterogeneity. Objectives: To define the prevalence and clinical significance of Ki-67 and Cyclin D1 overexpression in primary breast tumors ER positive, while highlighting the existence of intratumor heterogeneity in this type of cancer. Materials and methods: 51 ER positive breast cancer tumors were used to evaluate the intratumoral distribution of Ki-67 and Cyclin D1 expression. Image acquisition and visualization of the markers were performed by optical microscopy and stereology sampling method. Results: The mean Ki-67 labeling index was distributed heterogeneously in the same tumor, from 20.67±6.87 to 45.10±10.65. The coefficient of variation (COV) revealed dispersion values between 13.4% and 42.9%. Associated with positive ER status, all the tumors presented a Cyclin D1 expression with a COV varying between 19% and 28.5% and a mean labeling index fluctuating between 19.40±4.42 and 41.64±10.08 within the same patient showing important intratumor heterogeneous distribution. Conclusion: In this study, we have adopted a strictly quantitative approach to evaluate and demonstrate intratumor heterogeneity. This establishes one of the main factors for poor response to cancer therapy. To achieve this, intratumor heterogeneity should be usually definable and quantifiable but this domain awaits future progress and methods need to move towards a better understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms that initiate and maintain this tumor heterogeneity.","Latifa, Mohammedi; Fatima, Djillali Doula; Farida, Mesli; Rachid, Senhadji",Afr Health Sci,204,16

Methods: Auricular vagus nerve stimulation activates the parasympathetic system including anti-inflammatory pathways (the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis) while regulating the abnormal sympatho-vagal balance and improving respiratory control. Results: Along the paper (1) we expose the role of the parasympathetic system and the vagus nerve in the control of inflammatory processes (2) we formulate our physiological and methodological hypotheses (3) we provide a large body of clinical and preclinical data that support the favorable effects of auricular vagus nerve stimulation in inflammation, sympatho-vagal balance as well as in respiratory and cardiac ailments, and (4) we list the (few) possible collateral effects of the treatment. Finally, we discuss auricular vagus nerve stimulation protective potential, especially in the elderly and co-morbid population with already reduced parasympathetic response. Conclusions: Auricular vagus nerve stimulation is a safe clinical procedure and it could be either an effective treatment for ARDS originated by Covid-19 and similar viruses or a supplementary treatment to actual ARDS therapeutic approaches.","Kaniusas, Eugenijus; Szeles, Jozsef C.; Kampusch, Stefan; Alfageme-Lopez, Nuria; Yucuma-Conde, Daniela; Li, Xie; Mayol, Julio; Neumayer, Christoph; Papa, Michele; Panetsos, Fivos",Front.

Public health measures put in place by governments are essential to the success of controlling this disease. However, governments may not feel as incentivized to implement these measures when deaths are not rising along with cases. However, it is known that a delay exists between the time of infection and the time of death. This study attempted to find how long that lag is and how the age of people infected may affect that lag. DESIGN AND METHODS: A descriptive and correlational study was carried out to investigate the length of the lag and the relationship between lag and age. RESULTS: The average lag between daily Covid-19 cases and deaths was 8.053 days with a standard deviation of 4.116 days for nineteen regions. After excluding data from three more regions due to unavailable age data, the regression yielded an equation of lag = 14.015 - 0.153 (% cases above 60) with a p-value of 0.066. Because the p-value of 0.066 is lower than the 0.10 significance level, there is evidence that a relationship exists between the lag and the age of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that regions must remain vigilant when Covid-19 cases rapidly increase without similar increases in deaths since there exists a significant lag between the two. Additionally, a younger demographic of cases may lead to an increased lag, further pushing regions into a false sense of security that should be avoided.","Jin, Raymond",,204,26

It is most notably in the MF59 adjuvant, a component in some seasonal influenza vaccines, in stockpiled, emulsion-based adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccines, and with demonstrated efficacy for vaccines to other pandemic viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. Squalene has historically been harvested from shark liver oil, which is undesirable for a variety of reasons. In this study, we have demonstrated the use of a Synthetic Biology (yeast) production platform to generate squalene and novel triterpene oils, all of which are equally as efficacious as vaccine adjuvants based on physiochemical properties and immunomodulating activities in a mouse model. These Synthetic Biology adjuvants also elicited similar IgG1, IgG2a, and total IgG levels compared to marine and commercial controls when formulated with common quadrivalent influenza antigens. Injection site morphology and serum cytokine levels did not suggest any reactogenic effects of the yeast-derived squalene or novel triterpenes, suggesting their safety in adjuvant formulations. These results support the advantages of yeast produced triterpene oils to include completely controlled growth conditions, just-in-time and scalable production, and the capacity to produce novel triterpenes beyond squalene.","Tateno, Mizuki; Stone, Barbara J; Srodulski, Sarah J; Reedy, Stephanie; Gawriluk, Thomas R; Chambers, Thomas M; Woodward, Jerold; Chappell, Joe; Kempinski, Chase F",Sci Rep,204,1

Despite the critical functions in virus infection and contribution to the pattern of immunodominance in COVID-19, exploitation of the most abundant membrane (M) protein in the SARS-CoV-2 serology tests is minimal. This study investigated the recombinant M protein's immunoreactivity with the sera from COVID-19 convalescents. In silico designed protein was created from the outer N-terminal part (19 aa) and internal C-terminal tail (101-222 aa) of the M protein (YP_009724393.1) and was recombinantly produced and purified. The designed M protein (16,498.74 Da, pI 8.79) revealed both IgM and IgG reactivity with serum samples from COVID-19 convalescents in Western blot. In ELISA, more than 93% (28/30) of COVID-19 sera were positive for IgM detection, and more than 96% (29/30) were positive for specific IgG detection to M protein. Based on the capacity to provoke an immune response and its strong antigenic properties, as shown here, and the fact that it is also involved in the virion entry into host cells, the M protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as a good antigen has the potential in diagnostic purposes and vaccine design.","Lopandic, Zorana; Protic-Rosic, Isidora; Todorovic, Aleksandra; Glamoclija, Sofija; Gnjatovic, Marija; Cujic, Danica; Gavrovic-Jankulovic, Marija",Int. j. mol. sci.

While COVID-19 has overwhelmed healthcare resources (e.g., healthcare personnel, testing resources, hospital beds, and ventilators) in a number of countries, limited research has been conducted to understand spatial accessibility of such resources. This study fills this gap by rapidly measuring the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources with a particular focus on Illinois, USA. METHOD: The rapid measurement is achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic information science and systems). The E2SFCA has two major steps. First, it calculates a bed-to-population ratio for each hospital location. Second, it sums these ratios for residential locations where hospital locations overlap. RESULTS: The comparison of the spatial accessibility measures for COVID-19 patients to those of population at risk identifies which geographic areas need additional healthcare resources to improve access. The results also help delineate the areas that may face a COVID-19-induced shortage of healthcare resources. The Chicagoland, particularly the southern Chicago, shows an additional need for resources. This study also identified vulnerable population residing in the areas with low spatial accessibility in Chicago. CONCLUSION: Rapidly measuring spatial accessibility of healthcare resources provides an improved understanding of how well the healthcare infrastructure is equipped to save people's lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings are relevant for policymakers and public health practitioners to allocate existing healthcare resources or distribute new resources for maximum access to health services.","Kang, Jeon-Young; Michels, Alexander; Lyu, Fangzheng; Wang, Shaohua; Agbodo, Nelson; Freeman, Vincent L; Wang, Shaowen",Int J Health Geogr,204,0

The epidemiological evidence, diagnostic criteria and pathogenesis of post-COVID-19 syndrome are reviewed. DEVELOPMENT: Post-COVID-19 syndrome is defined by persistent clinical signs and symptoms that appear while or after suffering COVID-19, persist for more than 12 weeks and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. The symptoms can fluctuate or cause relapses. It is a heterogeneous condition that includes post-viral chronic fatigue syndrome, sequelae in multiple organs and the effects of severe hospitalisation/post-intensive care syndrome. It has been reported in patients with mild or severe COVID-19 and irrespective of the severity of the symptoms in the acute phase. Between 10% and 65% of survivors who had mild/moderate COVID-19 present symptoms of post-COVID-19 syndrome for 12 weeks or more. At six months, subjects report an average of 14 persistent symptoms. The most common symptoms are fatigue, dyspnoea, anxiety, depression, and impaired attention, concentration, memory and sleep. The underlying biological mechanisms are unknown, although an abnormal or excessive autoimmune and inflammatory response may play an important role. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical manifestations are diverse, fluctuating and variable, although fatigue and neurocognitive complaints predominate. There is no defined consensus on post-COVID-19 syndrome and its diagnostic criteria have not been subjected to adequate psychometric evaluation.","Carod-Artal, F J",Rev Neurol,204,16

Critics have been quick to point out capitalism’s emphasis on resource exploitation, growth and profit is to blame and that tourism destinations have never been encouraged to foster diverse economic practices which would enhance resilient communities and regenerative tourism. The diverse economies framework envisages the co-existence of capitalist, alternative capitalist and non-capitalist practices and provides a pathway to more resilient and regenerative tourism practices in tourism. Tourism industry cases are used to illustrate the innovation inherent in diverse economic practices (enterprise, exchange, labour, transactions, property etc.) and illustrate their natural resilience as a result.

At this time, there is no valid vaccine and no proven drug treatment for COVID-19 patients. Current treatments are focused on Oxygenation, Cytokine Storm management, anti-inflammatory effects, and antiviral therapy. Antiviral photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is based on the reaction between a photo-sensitive agent and a light source in the presence of oxygen which can produce oxidative and free radical agents to damage the virus' structures. Recent studies show that nanotechnology can improve aPDT's outcome. The aim of this study was to find out the potential therapeutic effects of Nano antiviral photodynamic therapy on COVID-19.

The disease-specific molecular events, which may induce susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, are being investigated. To assess this, we retrieved array-based gene expression datasets from patients of 30 frequently occurring acute, chronic, or infectious diseases. Comparative analyses of the datasets were performed after quantile normalization and log2 transformation. Among the 78 host genes prominently implicated in COVID-19 infection, ACE2 (receptor for SARS-CoV-2) was positively regulated in several cases, namely, leukemia, psoriasis, lung cancer, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), breast cancer, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). FURIN was positively regulated in some cases, such as leukemia, psoriasis, NAFLD, lung cancer, and type II diabetes (T2D), while TMPRSS2 was positively regulated in only 3 cases, namely, leukemia, lung cancer, and T2D. Genes encoding various interferons, cytokines, chemokines, and mediators of JAK-STAT pathway were positively regulated in leukemia, NAFLD, and T2D cases. Among the 161 genes that are positively regulated in the lungs of COVID-19 patients, 99-111 genes in leukemia (including various studied subtypes), 77 genes in NAFLD, and 48 genes in psoriasis were also positively regulated. Because of the high similarity in gene expression patterns, the patients of leukemia, NAFLD, T2D, psoriasis, and PAH may need additional preventive care against acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infections. Further, two genes CARBONIC ANHYDRASE 11 (CA11) and CLUSTERIN (CLU) were positively regulated in the lungs of patients infected with either SARS-CoV-2, or SARS-CoV or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).","Singh, Manoj Kumar; Mobeen, Ahmed; Chandra, Amit; Joshi, Sweta; Ramachandran, Srinivasan",Comput Biol Med,204,16

Leprosy is a communicable neglected tropical disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae and is an important health problem in low- and middle-income countries. The natural history of leprosy means that affected individuals need long-term follow-up. The measures recommended to reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can create barriers to health services. We evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic response on leprosy services and disease management. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey with healthcare professionals in leprosy referral centres. RESULTS: Eighty percent of leprosy diagnostic services were reduced. All respondents reported that multidrug therapy (MDT) was available but two reported a reduced stock. Clinicians used alternative strategies such as telephone consultations to maintain contact with patients. However, patients were not able to travel to the referral centres. DISCUSSION: This study highlights the effects of the initial phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on leprosy services in a range of leprosy-endemic countries. Many services remained open, providing leprosy diagnosis, MDT and leprosy reaction medications.

Many infected patients have respiratory involvement that may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of low-dose whole-lung radiation therapy in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this clinical trial, conducted in Iran, we enrolled patients with COVID-19 who were older than 60 years and hospitalized to receive supplementary oxygen for their documented pneumonia. Participants were treated with whole-lung irradiation in a single fraction of 0.5 Gy plus the national protocol for the management of COVID-19. Vital signs (including blood oxygenation and body temperature) and laboratory findings (interleukin-6 and C-reactive peptide) were recorded before and after irradiation. RESULTS: Between May 21, 2020 and June 24, 2020, 5 patients received whole-lung irradiation. They were followed for 5 to 7 days to evaluate the response to treatment and toxicities. The clinical and paraclinical findings of 4 of the 5 patients (patient 4 worsened and died on day 3) improved on the first day of irradiation. Patient 3 opted out of the trial on the third day after irradiation. The mean time to discharge was 6 days for the other 3 patients. No acute radiation-induced toxicity was recorded. CONCLUSIONS: With a response rate of 80%, whole-lung irradiation in a single fraction of 0.5 Gy had encouraging results in oxygen-dependent patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Ameri, Ahmad; Rahnama, Nazanin; Bozorgmehr, Rama; Mokhtari, Majid; Farahbakhsh, Mohammad; Nabavi, Mahmood; Shoaei, Simin Dokht; Izadi, Hossein; Yousefi Kashi, Amir Shahram; Dehbaneh, Hadiseh Shabanpour; Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farzad",Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,204,16

RECENT FINDINGS: From a total of 455 titles on COVID-19 and alcohol, 227 abstracts were screened, and 95 articles were reviewed (on November 25th, 2020). The immediate effect was an increase in alcohol related emergencies including alcohol withdrawal, related suicides, and methanol toxicity. Although there are mixed findings with respect to changes in the quantity of drinking, there are reports of binge/heavy drinking during the lockdown as well as relapse postlockdown. Psychological, social, biological, economic and policy-related factors appear to influence the changes in drinking. Although preliminary data suggest no change in alcohol use among persons with comorbid mental illness, findings in this population are presently limited. Among patients with alcohol related liver disease, outcomes appear worse and caution is warranted with the use of medications. Alcohol also appears to increases the risk of COVID-19 infection and complicates its course.Although some nations banned alcohol sales completely during lockdown, others declared it as an essential commodity, resulting in different problems across countries. Alcohol use has added to the burden of the problem particularly among vulnerable groups like the adolescents, elderly, patients with cancer, as well as health professionals. Services for patients with alcohol use disorders have been affected. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has had considerable impact on alcohol use, with an increase in alcohol related emergencies, changes in alcohol use patterns, increased risk of contracting COVID-19, effect on alcohol policies and sales, and an effect on vulnerable groups. It is essential to understand and respond to the current situation, intervene early, and prevent further repercussions of the pandemic.Video abstract link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IJWtIs6e554PryKWhdma4VB--mjSZq1C/view?usp=sharing.","Murthy, Pratima; Narasimha, Venkata Lakshmi",Curr Opin Psychiatry,204,1

This assay can be completed in two steps in a label-free fashion, yielding a ""signal-on"" signal readout, which usually cannot be attained by electrochemical label-free detection using no labels or markers to tag the target protein. The proposed assay also utilizes no antibodies or enzyme-based reagents. The method achieves this performance by moderating the frequency of electrochemical potential scanning such that the scanning rate keeps pace with, or ""resonances"" with, the molecular motion of the probe molecule. This method has been successfully applied to detect the three target proteins in serum samples collected from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results indicate a strong correlation with the risk of deteriorating into severe acute conditions after virus infection. Soon, the clinical application of this method may provide a low-cost but effective method for virus surveillance in the general public.","Zhou, Lei; Hao, Panpan; Li, Hao; Zhang, Zhongwen",ACS Sens,204,22

The proportion of infected individuals who seroconvert is still an open question. In addition, it has been shown in some individuals that viral genome can be detected up to 3 months after symptom resolution. We investigated both seroconversion and PCR positivity in a large cohort of convalescent serum donors in the New York City (NY, USA) region. Methods: In this observational study, we ran an outreach programme in the New York City area. We recruited participants via the REDCap (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA) online survey response. Individuals with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened via PCR for presence of viral genome and via ELISA for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies. One-way ANOVA and Fisher's exact test were used to measure the association of age, gender, symptom duration, and days from symptom onset and resolution with positive antibody results. Findings: Between March 26 and April 10, 2020, we measured SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres in 1343 people. Of the 624 participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who had serologies done after 4 weeks, all but three seroconverted to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, whereas 269 (37%) of 719 participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection seroconverted. PCR positivity was detected up to 28 days from symptom resolution. Interpretation: Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 seroconvert, potentially providing immunity to reinfection. We also report that in a large proportion of individuals, viral genome can be detected via PCR in the upper respiratory tract for weeks after symptom resolution, but it is unclear whether this signal represents infectious virus. Analysis of our large cohort suggests that most patients with mild COVID-19 seroconvert 4 weeks after illness, and raises questions about the use of PCR to clear positive individuals.

We sought to determine whether COVID-19 affected the treatment and prognosis of hemorrhagic stroke in a regional medical center in mainland China. METHODS: Patients with hemorrhagic stroke admitted in the Neurosurgery Department of West China Hospital from January 24, 2020, to March 25, 2020 (COVID-19 period), and from January 24, 2019, to March 25, 2019 (pre-COVID-19 period), were identified. Clinical characteristics, hospital arrival to neurosurgery department arrival time (door-to-department time), reporting rate of pneumonia and 3-month mRS (outcome) were compared. RESULTS: A total of 224 patients in the pre-COVID-19 period were compared with 126 patients in the COVID-19 period. Milder stroke severity was observed in the COVID-19 period (NIHSS 6 [2-20] vs. 3 [2-15], pâ¯=â¯0.005). The median door-to-department time in the COVID-19 period was approximately 50 minutes longer than that in the pre-COVID-19 period (96.5 [70.3-193.3] vs. 144.5 [93.8-504.5], pâ¯=â¯0.000). A higher rate of pneumonia complications was reported in the COVID-19 period (40.6% vs. 60.7%, pâ¯=â¯0.000).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-one patients with COVID-19 were divided into two groups: an improvement/stabilization group (n = 53) and a progression group (n = 8). Clinical data were collected to analyze and compare the differences between the two groups. RESULTS: Of the sixty-one patients, thirty-one were male (50.8%), and thirty were female (49.2%), with a median age of 53 years. On admission, significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to the levels of Creatine Kinase (CK), lymphocytes, D-dimer and creatinine, and prothrombin time (PT). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocytes, Mean platelet volume to lymphocyte ratio (MPVLR), CK, White Blood count to mean platelet volume ratio (WMR), Lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), and serum creatinine were important factors for disease progression. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that PLR was an independent factor for disease progression in COVID-19 patients. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve revealed that the best predictor of disease progression was CK. Dynamic changes in the laboratory indicators of patients were tracked, and significant differences were found in the variation trends of white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and WMR, which gradually increased in the progression group, but gradually decreased in the improvement/stabilization group. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for disease progression included PLR, lymphocytes, MPVLR, CK, WMR, LMR, and creatinine, among which, PLR is an independent risk factor for disease progression in COVID-19 patients.","Xing, Y; Wang, H; Yao, X-H; Li, Y; Huang, J-T; Tang, J; Zhu, S; Liu, Y-Q; Xiao, J",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,204,7

The model can simulate the traditional Chinese medicine treatment of common disease syndromes in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Diagnosis and Treatment Program(the sixth edition for trial). Specific steps were as follows. ABALB/c mouse model of cold and dampness syndrome was established, based on which, HCoV-229 E virus was infected; then the experiment was divided into normal control group, infection control group, cold-dampness control group, cold-dampness infection group(the model group), high-dose Chaiyin Particles group(8.8 g·kg~(-1)·d~(-1)), and low-dose Chaiyin Particles group(4.4 g·kg~(-1)·d~(-1)). On the day of infection, Chaiyin Particles was given for three consecutive days. Lung tissues were collected the day after the last dose, and the lung index and inhibition rate were calculated. The nucleic acid of lung tissue was extracted, and the HCoV-229 E virus load was detected by Real-time fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR. Blood leukocytes were separated, and the percentage of T and B lymphocytes was detected by flow cytometry. Lung tissue protein was extracted, and IL-6, IL-10, TNF-&#945; and IFN-Î³ contents were detected by ELISA. High and low-dose Chaiyin Particles significantly reduced the lung index(P&lt;0.01) of mice of human coronavirus pneumonia with pestilence attacking the lung syndrome, and the inhibition rates were 61.02% and 55.45%, respectively. Compared with the model control group, high and low-dose Chaiyin Particles significantly increased cross blood CD4~+ T lymphocytes, CD8~+T lymphocytes and total B lymphocyte percentage(P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01), and reduced IL-10, TNF-&#945; and IFN-Î³ levels in lungs(P&lt;0.01).

The total number of Covid-19-infected people in São Paulo has reached more than 1 million, while its total death toll stands at 25% of all the country's fatalities. Joining the Brazilian academia efforts in the fight against Covid-19, in this paper we describe a unified framework for monitoring and forecasting the Covid-19 progress in the state of São Paulo. More specifically, a freely available, online platform to collect and exploit Covid-19 time-series data is presented, supporting decision-makers while still allowing the general public to interact with data from different regions of the state. Moreover, a novel forecasting data-driven method has also been proposed, by combining the so-called Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased model with machine learning strategies to better fit the mathematical model's coefficients for predicting Infections, Recoveries, Deaths, and Viral Reproduction Numbers. We show that the obtained predictor is capable of dealing with badly conditioned data samples while still delivering accurate 10-day predictions. Our integrated computational system can be used for guiding government actions mainly in two basic aspects: real-time data assessment and dynamic predictions of Covid-19 curves for different regions of the state. We extend our analysis and investigation to inspect the virus spreading in Brazil in its regions. Finally, experiments involving the Covid-19 advance in other countries are also given.","Amaral, Fabio; Casaca, Wallace; Oishi, Cassio M; Cuminato, José A",Sensors (Basel),204,16

Hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin have been widely used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) despite a paucity of evidence regarding efficacy. The incidence of torsade de pointes remains unknown. Widespread use of these medications forced overwhelmed health care systems to search for ways to effectively monitor these patients while simultaneously trying to minimize health care provider exposure and use of personal protective equipment. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 positive who received hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin across 13 hospitals between March 1 and April 15 were included in this study. A comprehensive search of the electronic medical records was performed using a proprietary python script to identify any mention of QT prolongation, ventricular tachy-arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. RESULTS: The primary outcome of torsade de pointes was observed in 1 (0.015%) out of 6476 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin. Sixty-seven (1.03%) had hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin held or discontinued due to an average QT prolongation of 60.5±40.5 ms from a baseline QTc of 473.7±35.9 ms to a peak QTc of 532.6±31.6 ms. Of these patients, hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin were discontinued in 58 patients (86.6%), while one or more doses of therapy were held in the remaining nine (13.4%). A simplified approach to monitoring for QT prolongation and arrythmia was implemented on April 5. There were no deaths related to the medications with the simplified monitoring approach and health care provider exposure was reduced. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of torsade de pointes is low in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin therapy.","Saleh, Moussa; Gabriels, James; Chang, David; Fishbein, Joanna; Qiu, Michael; Mountantonakis, Stavros E; Epstein, Laurence M",Circ Arrhythm Electrophysiol,204,1

Whereas the definitive pathogenesis of COVID-19-related AKI (CoV-AKI) is not clear, histopathologic evidence seems to point at multiple etiologies for the disease, including indirect and direct viral kidney injury. The high incidence of CoV-AKI, along with the aggressive clinical presentation of this entity, have increased the demands for kidney replacement therapies, rapidly overwhelming the supplies of healthcare systems even in major tertiary care centers. As a result, nephrologists have come up with alternatives to maximize the efficiency of treatments and have developed non-conventional therapeutic alternatives such as the implementation of acute peritoneal dialysis for critically ill patients. The long-term implications of CoV-AKI are yet unknown, though early studies suggest that around one third of the patients who survive will remain dependent on kidney replacement therapy. Nephrologists and healthcare workers need to be familiar with the clinical presentation and therapeutic challenges of CoV-AKI in order to develop strategies to mitigate the burden of the disease for patients, and for services providing kidney replacement therapies.","Sanchez-Russo, Luis; Billah, Marzuq; Chancay, Jorge; Hindi, Judy; Cravedi, Paolo",,204,1

There is currently no licensed antiviral treatment available to prevent human CoV infection. The widespread clinical use and existing knowledge on antiviral mechanisms of remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of previous epidemic diseases, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), may be helpful in the combat with novel SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent clinical evidence didn't confirm the beneficial role of lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients and their use was reassessed. We provide an overview of the current evidence into the mechanisms of action of these available drugs which are repurposed for treatment of the new virus. Available data identifies remdesivir as an adenosine analogue that can target the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and block viral RNA synthesis. It has been a promising antiviral drug against a wide array of RNA viruses. 3CLpro is a major CoV protease that cleaves the large replicase polyproteins during viral replication and can be targeted by the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir but the clinical effects are controversial. Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine could impair the replication of SARSCoV-2 by multiple mechanisms and their immunomodulatory properties could ameliorate clinical manifestations that are mediated by immune reactions of the host although its beneficial effects are under question and need to be proven at the clinical level. Existing in vitro and in vivo evidence delineate the molecular mechanisms of these drugs in CoV-infected cells. Numerous studies demonstrated the ability of remdesivir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication but future research would be needed to understand the exact mode of action of lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and to use this knowledge in the treatment of the current COVID-19.","Uzunova, Katya; Filipova, Elena; Pavlova, Velichka; Vekov, Toni",Biomed Pharmacother,204,24

However, lung epithelial cells are increasingly recognized as active effectors of microbial defence, contributing to both innate and adaptive immune function in the lower respiratory tract. These cells express an ample repertoire of pattern recognition receptors with specificity for conserved microbial and host motifs. Modern molecular techniques have uncovered the complexity of the lower respiratory tract microbiome. The interaction between the microbiota and the airway epithelium is key to understanding how stable immune homeostasis is maintained. Loss of epithelial integrity following exposure to infection can result in the onset of inflammation in susceptible individuals and may culminate in lung disease. Here we discuss the current knowledge regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the pulmonary epithelium interacts with the lung microbiome in shaping immunity in the lung. Specifically, we focus on the interactions between the lung microbiome and the cells of the conducting airways in modulating immune cell regulation, and how defects in barrier structure and function may culminate in lung disease. Understanding these interactions is fundamental in the search for more effective therapies for respiratory diseases.","Invernizzi, Rachele; Lloyd, Clare M; Molyneaux, Philip L",Immunology,204,20

A key criterion for the ethical acceptability of SARS-CoV2 HCS is that potential benefits outweigh risks. Although the assessment of risks and benefits is meant to be a standard part of research ethics review, systematic comparisons are particularly important in the context of SARS-CoV2 HCS in light of the significant potential benefits and harms at stake as well as the need to preserve public trust in research and vaccines. In this paper we explore several considerations that should inform systematic assessment of SARS-CoV-2 HCS. First, we detail key potential benefits of SARS-CoV-2 HCS including, but not limited to, those related to the acceleration of vaccine development. Second, we identify where modelling is needed to inform risk-benefit (and thus ethical) assessments. Modelling will be particularly useful in (i) comparing potential benefits and risks of HCS with those of vaccine field trials under different epidemiological conditions and (ii) estimating marginal risks to HCS participants in light of the background probabilities of infection in their local community. We highlight interactions between public health policy and research priorities, including situations in which research ethics assessments may need to strike a balance between competing considerations.","Jamrozik, Euzebiusz; Heriot, George S; Selgelid, Michael J",J. bioeth. inq,204,26

With the given aim, 1-) coronavirus-associated sequences, which are homologous to the 15mer SARS-CoV-2 peptide CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC, are obtained. 2-) Human peptides that have at least 7 residue matches with those coronavirus sequences, and the SARS-CoV-2 15mer, are found. 3-) Epitope pairs, which are sourced by those aligned coronavirus and human sequences are identified. 4-) Epitope pairs that are predicted to bind strongly not only to the same HLA allele with each other but also to the same HLA allele as those of the respective alignment of the SARS-CoV-2 peptide are selected. Following are the identified proteins or peptides (with HLA-A*02:01 or HLA-A*24:02 epitopes), as described in 1-to-4: Immunoglobulin heavy chain junction regions, CRB1 isoform I precursor, slit homolog 2 protein, hCG1995581, hCG2028737, phospholipid phosphatase-related protein type 2.

The majority of COVID-19 prognostic tools use only data present upon admission and do not incorporate changes occurring after admission. OBJECTIVE: To develop the Severe COVID-19 Adaptive Risk Predictor (SCARP) (https://rsconnect.biostat.jhsph.edu/covid_trajectory/), a novel tool that can provide dynamic risk predictions for progression from moderate disease to severe illness or death in patients with COVID-19 at any time within the first 14 days of their hospitalization. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Five hospitals in Maryland and Washington, D.C. PATIENTS: Patients who were hospitalized between 5 March and 4 December 2020 with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) confirmed by nucleic acid test and symptomatic disease. MEASUREMENTS: A clinical registry for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was the primary data source; data included demographic characteristics, admission source, comorbid conditions, time-varying vital signs, laboratory measurements, and clinical severity. Random forest for survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (RF-SLAM) data analysis was applied to predict the 1-day and 7-day risks for progression to severe disease or death for any given day during the first 14 days of hospitalization. RESULTS: Among 3163 patients admitted with moderate COVID-19, 228 (7%) became severely ill or died in the next 24 hours; an additional 355 (11%) became severely ill or died in the next 7 days. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) for 1-day risk predictions for progression to severe disease or death was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.88 to 0.90) and 0.89 (CI, 0.87 to 0.91) during the first and second weeks of hospitalization, respectively. The AUC for 7-day risk predictions for progression to severe disease or death was 0.83 (CI, 0.83 to 0.84) and 0.87 (CI, 0.86 to 0.89) during the first and second weeks of hospitalization, respectively. LIMITATION: The SCARP tool was developed by using data from a single health system. CONCLUSION: Using the predictive power of RF-SLAM and longitudinal data from more than 3000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, an interactive tool was developed that rapidly and accurately provides the probability of an individual patient's progression to severe illness or death on the basis of readily available clinical information.

Inflammation most probably represents a common denominator through which classical and nonclassical risk factors stimulate thrombotic process. Inflammation of the venous wall promotes the release of tissue factor, inhibits the release of anticoagulant factors, and hampers endogenous fibrinolysis. Systemic inflammatory response also inhibits restoration of blood flow in the occluded vessel. Recent studies indicate that increased inflammatory response (""cytokine storm"") is related to prothrombotic state and thromboembolic events in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The growing evidence of involvement of inflammation in the pathogenesis of VTE indicates the importance of anti-inflammatory treatment and prevention of VTE. While aspirin was shown to be effective in prevention of recurrent venous thrombosis after treatment with anticoagulant drugs, some other anti-inflammatory drugs like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents may have prothrombotic effect, thus potentially increasing the risk of VTE. Recently, new specific anti-inflammatory drug inhibitors of inflammatory markers that have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of VTE are being searched. As thrombogenesis is based on activation of coagulation provoked by inflammation, then prevention and treatment of VTE should include both anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory agents. Combined treatment is related to increased risk of bleeding complications, therefore subtherapeutic doses of both drugs should be used to improve the efficacy of management of VTE without increasing the risk of bleeding.","Poredos, Peter; Poredos, Pavel",Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,204,15

Accurate identification of phenotypes will be important to guide future research and the healthcare system to focus its efforts and resources on adequately controlled age- and gender-specific sequelae of COVID-19 infection. In this retrospective electronic health records (EHR) cohort study, we applied a computational framework for knowledge discovery from clinical data, MLHO, to identify phenotypes that positively associate with a past positive PCR test for COVID-19. We evaluated the post-test phenotypes in two temporal windows at 3-6 and 6-9 months after the test and by age and gender. We utilized longitudinal diagnosis records stored in EHRs from Mass General Brigham (MGB) 57 thousand patients who tested positive or negative for COVID-19 and were not hospitalized. Statistical analyses were performed on data from March 2020 to March 2021. PCR test results and subsequent diagnosis records that were recorded for the first time two months or later after the PCR test. We identified 28 phenotypes among different age/gender cohorts or time windows that positively associated with past SARS-CoV-2 infection. All identified phenotypes were newly recorded in patients' medical records two months or longer after a COVID-19 PCR test in non-hospitalized patients regardless of the test result. Among these phenotypes, a new diagnosis record for anosmia and dysgeusia (OR 2.17, 95% CI [1.42 - 3.25]), alopecia (OR 3.54, 95% CI [2.92 - 4.3]), chest pain (OR 1.35, 95% CI [1.16 - 1.56]), or chronic fatigue syndrome (OR 1.81-2.28, 95% CI [1.38 - 3.68]) are the most significant indicators of a past COVID-19 infection, especially among women younger than 65. Among men, edema (OR 1.83, 95% CI [1.23 - 2.66]) and disease of the nail (OR 3.54, 95% CI [1.63 - 7.29]) in patients 65 and older or proteinuria (OR 2.66, 95% CI [1.61 - 4.34]) in patients under 65 are associated with a positive COVID-19 PCR test in the past few months. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive discoveries while offering a more probabilistic flexible criterion than the standard linear phenome-wide association study (PheWAS). These findings suggest that some of the previously identified post sequelae of COVID-19 may not be accurate and that most of the PASC are observed in patients under 65 years of age.","Estiri, H.; Strasser, Z.; Brat, G.; Semenov, Y.; Patel, C.; Murphy, S.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,204,1

The number of measures used, and the range of measures applied, have far exceeded previous public health emergencies of international concern. However, efforts to advance research, policy and practice to support their effective use has been hindered by a lack of clear and consistent definition. RESULTS: Based on a review of existing datasets for cross-border health measures, such as the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker and World Health Organization Public Health and Social Measures, along with analysis of secondary and grey literature, we propose six categories to define measures more clearly and consistently – policy goal, type of movement (travel and trade), adopted by public or private sector, level of jurisdiction applied, stage of journey, and degree of restrictiveness. These categories are then brought together into a proposed typology that can support research with generalizable findings and comparative analyses across jurisdictions. Addressing the current gaps in evidence about travel measures, including how different jurisdictions apply such measures with varying effects, in turn, enhances the potential for evidence-informed decision-making based on fuller understanding of policy trade-offs and externalities. Finally, through the adoption of standardized terminology and creation of an agreed evidentiary base recognized across jurisdictions, the typology can support efforts to strengthen coordinated global responses to outbreaks and inform future efforts to revise the WHO International Health Regulations (2005). CONCLUSIONS: The widespread use of cross-border health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted significant reflection on available evidence, previous practice and existing legal frameworks. The typology put forth in this paper aims to provide a starting point for strengthening research, policy and practice.","Lee, Kelley; Grépin, Karen A.; Worsnop, Catherine; Marion, Summer; Piper, Julianne; Song, Mingqi",Global Health,204,8

The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the impact of the lockdown secondary to the pandemic on patient numbers and pattern of injuries at the department of traumatology of the Medical University of Vienna. METHODS: This retrospective, descriptive study identified all patients admitted and enrolled onto the trauma registry at a level I trauma center, between 15 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 (lockdown) and compared them to those between 15 March 2019 and 30 April 2019 (baseline). Variables collected included patient age, sex, reason for hospital admission, place of injury, death, injury severity score (ISS), as well as American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score. RESULTS: A total of 10,938 patient visits to the trauma emergency department were analyzed, 8353 presentations during the baseline period and 2585 during lockdown. Only 1869 acutely injured and 716 follow-up patients presented during lockdown, compared to 6178 and 2175, respectively, during baseline. Throughout the COVID-19 lockdown there were significant reductions in both workplace and traffic accidents, sports injuries, number of hospitalized patients, and overall visits to the trauma emergency department; however, the number of major traumas and hip fractures remained similar. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the frequency of injuries at home as well as hospital admissions due to attempted suicide. CONCLUSION: Despite the reduction in total number of patients, trauma departments should continue to provide adequate service during lockdown considering that severe injuries showed no change. Conditions such as breakdown of social networks and limited access to mental health care and support might account for the significant rise in hospital admissions due to suicides. We recommend that more attention and effort should be made to prevent this excess of suicide deaths.","Nia, Arastoo; Popp, Domenik; Diendorfer, Cornelia; Apprich, Sebastian; Munteanu, Alexandru; Hajdu, Stefan; Widhalm, Harald K.",Wien Klin Wochenschr,204,16

This study investigates vaccine confidence amongst Chinese caregivers and vaccination-service providers (VSPs) six months after the CCVI. METHODS: Quantitative surveys were conducted in January 2019 with 2124 caregivers of children and 555 VSPs in three areas in China. The proportions of respondents who agreed to the four statements from the Vaccine Confidence Index™ were used to measure vaccine confidence. Descriptive and univariate analyses were performed to study the level of vaccine confidence. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 48 caregivers, 43 VSPs and 9 immunization program managers. Interviews were analyzed thematically using a combination of deductive and inductive coding. Media surveillance was conducted to monitor public responses to the CCVI. RESULTS: Media surveillance indicated that public attention to vaccine-related issues increased sharply immediately post-CCVI but declined rapidly thereafter. Six months post-CCVI, 96.0% of caregivers and the same proportion of VSPs reported that vaccination was important and compatible with their religious beliefs. 82.7% and 88.2% of caregivers agreed that vaccines were safe and effective. 92.8% and 94.6% of VSPs agreed that vaccines were safe and effective. Both caregivers and VSPs reported an immediate decline in vaccine confidence post-CCVI. In most cases this trust was regained over time following government and public health responses, however some people remained hesitant about vaccinating their children. Many VSPs were overwhelmed by consultations, workload and psychological pressure after the CCVI. CONCLUSION: After an initial decline, vaccine confidence recovered to pre-incident levels six months after the CCVI. However, some caregivers moved from the higher to the lower end of the vaccine confidence spectrum, pointing to the need to promote the acceptance of vaccination especially given the need for new vaccines to control the coronavirus epidemic.","Tu, Shiyi; Sun, Fiona Yueqian; Chantler, Tracey; Zhang, Xuan; Jit, Mark; Han, Kaiyi; Rodewald, Lance; Du, Fanxing; Yu, Hongjie; Hou, Zhiyuan; Larson, Heidi",Vaccine,204,1

It is assumed that the society consists of four compartments; susceptible individuals (S), infected individuals at large (I), quarantined patients (Q) and recovered individuals (R), and the time evolution of the pandemic is described by a set of ordinary differential equations. It is shown that the quarantine rate can be determined from the time dependence of the daily confirmed new cases, from which the number of infected individuals can be estimated. The infection rate and quarantine rate are determined for the period from mid-February to mid-April in Japan and transmission characteristics of the initial stages of the outbreak in Japan are analyzed in connection with the policies employed by the government. The effectiveness of different measures is discussed for controlling the outbreak and it is shown that identifying patients through PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) testing and isolating them in a quarantine is more effective than lockdown measures aimed at inhibiting social interactions of the general population. An effective reproduction number for infected individuals at large is introduced which is appropriate to epidemics controlled by quarantine measures.","Odagaki, Takashi",Infect Dis Model,204,17

Such pressures may impact on working conditions, psychological wellbeing and perception of safety. In spite of this, no study has assessed the relationship between safety attitudes and psychological outcomes. Moreover, only limited studies have examined the relationship between personal characteristics and psychological outcomes during Covid-19. Methods From 22nd March 2020 to 18th June 2020, healthcare workers from the United Kingdom, Poland, and Singapore were invited to participate using a self-administered questionnaire comprising the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate safety culture, burnout and anxiety/depression. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of burnout, anxiety and depression. Results Of 3,537 healthcare workers who participated in the study, 2,364 (67%) screened positive for burnout, 701 (20%) for anxiety, and 389 (11%) for depression. Significant predictors of burnout included patient-facing roles: doctor (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.49-2.95), nurse (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.04-1.84), and other clinical staff (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.45-2.82); being redeployed (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.02-1.58), bottom quartile SAQ score (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.98-2.99), anxiety (OR 4.87; 95% CI 3.92-6.06) and depression (OR 4.06; 95% CI 3.04-5.42). Factors significantly protective for burnout included being tested for SARS-CoV-2 (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.51-0.82) and top quartile SAQ score (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.22-0.40). Significant factors associated with anxiety and depression, included burnout, gender, safety attitudes and job role. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate a significant burden of burnout, anxiety, and depression amongst healthcare workers. A strong association was seen between SARS-CoV-2 testing, safety attitudes, gender, job role, redeployment and psychological state. These findings highlight the importance of targeted support services for at risk groups and proactive SARS-CoV-2 testing of healthcare workers.","Denning, M.; Goh, E.

The complete maps of thousands of bacterial and viral genomes have recently been defined; however, the rate at which physiological or biochemical functions have been assigned to genes has greatly lagged. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) addressed this gap by creating functional genomics centers dedicated to developing high-throughput approaches to assign gene function. These centers require broad-based and collaborative research programs to generate and integrate diverse data to achieve a comprehensive understanding of microbial pathogenesis. High-throughput functional genomics can lead to new therapeutics and better understanding of the next generation of emerging pathogens by rapidly defining new general mechanisms by which organisms cause disease and replicate in host tissues and by facilitating the rate at which functional data reach the scientific community.","Baric, Ralph S.; Crosson, Sean; Damania, Blossom; Miller, Samuel I.; Rubin, Eric J.",mBio,204,16

Though data exist on the positivity rate of the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test as well as COVID-19-related deaths amongst HCWs in South Africa, the overall infection rate remains underestimated by these indicators. It is also unclear whether the humoral immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection offers durable protection against reinfection. This study will assess the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence amongst HCWs in the Eastern Cape (EC) and examine the longitudinal changes (rate of decay) in the antibody levels after infection in this cohort. Using a multi-stage cluster sampling of healthcare workers in selected health facilities in the EC, a cross-sectional study of 2250 participants will be recruited. In order to assess the community infection rate, 750 antenatal women in the same settings will be recruited. Relevant demographic and clinical characteristics will be obtained by a self-administered questionnaire. A chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) will be used for the qualitative detection of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. A nested cohort study will be conducted by performing eight-weekly antibody assays (X2) from 201 participants who tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and serology. Logistic regression models will be fitted to identify the independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infection rate and infection fatality rate among the frontline HCWs will be estimated. In addition, the study will highlight the overall effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures (IPC) per exposure sites/wards at the selected health facilities. Findings will inform the South African Department of Health’s policies on how to protect HCWs better as the country prepares for the second wave of the SARS-CoV pandemic.","Adeniyi, Oladele Vincent; Stead, David; Singata-Madliki, Mandisa; Batting, Joanne; Hyera, Leo; Jelliman, Eloise; Abrahams, Shareef; Parrish, Andrew",Int J Environ Res Public Health,204,28

Furthermore, we proposed and validated a nomogram to stratify risks of intra-spinal canal cement leakage. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 163 elderly patients (age ≧65 years) with spine metastases who underwent PVP. Patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (n=100) and a validation cohort (n=63). The multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to screen potential risk variables in the training cohort. Significant risk variables were included in the nomogram, and the nomogram was developed according to the estimates of the each included variable. The predictive effectiveness of the nomogram was validated using discrimination and calibration performance. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of intra-spinal canal cement leakage was 9.82% (16/163). In the training cohort, female patients (14.71%, 5/34) showed a higher rate of intra-spinal canal cement leakage as compared with male patients (4.55%, 3/66). The nomogram consisted of sex, cortical osteolytic destruction in posterior wall, and load-bearing lines of spine. The nomogram had acceptable discrimination, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.75 in the training cohort, 0.64 in the validation cohort, and 0.69 in the entire cohort, and also showed favorable calibration based on the goodness-of-fit test. According to the nomogram, three risk groups were developed: the low risk group had an actual probability of 7.03%, the medium risk group was 11.54%, and high risk group was 44.44%. The difference between the three groups was significant (P ˂ 0.01). CONCLUSION: Intra-spinal canal cement leakage after PVP is not scarce among elderly patients. We proposed and internally validated a nomogram that is capable of calculating the risk of intra-spinal canal cement leakage among elderly patients with spine metastases. Careful surgical plan should be conducted among patients with a high risk of developing intra-spinal canal cement leakage.","Shi, Xuedong; Cui, Yunpeng; Pan, Yuanxing; Wang, Bing; Lei, Mingxing",Clin Interv Aging,204,27

The virus replication cycle generates new viral genomes and proteins in sufficient quantities to ensure propagation of the viral genome; this requires that the extracellular viral genome is protected from enzymatic degradation and can be introduced into further target cells for further rounds of replication. The initial recognition between virus and host is more complex than originally supposed and may involve more than one cellular receptor. A critical first intracellular step is the generation of viral mRNA by one of a limited number of strategies first described by David Baltimore. Lacking ribosomes, viruses have no means of producing protein and are reliant on the host cell for protein synthesis. Viral proteins are often modified by host cell glycosylation during or after virus assembly. Temporal regulation of intracellular events is critical in all but the very simplest of viruses, and some form of suppression of the host innate immune response is common to nearly all human viruses. Infected cells often produce non-infectious particles with incomplete genomes, and these defective interfering particles may play a role in pathogenesis. Understanding these processes will open up a range of targets for the development of novel therapies.","Burrell, Christopher J.; Howard, Colin R.; Murphy, Frederick A.",Fenner and White's Medical Virology,204,18

One hundred clinical specimens were collected from Egyptian children suffering from upper and lower respiratory viral infections in the years 2005–2006 to detect HCoV-NL63 genome using RT-PCR. All the specimens were negative for the virus. Also, a complete absence of HCoV-NL63 genome was observed in the twenty-four raw sewage samples collected from two wastewater treatment plants within Greater Cairo from February 2006 to January 2007. Using nested RT-PCR, parainfluenza virus type 1, respiratory syncytial virus type A, adenovirus type 4, and adenovirus type 7 were detected in 3%, 2%, 5%, and 2% of the clinical specimens, respectively. Of these viruses, only adenovirus type 4 was detected in 1/24 (4.17%) of the raw sewage samples, while a complete absence of the other investigated respiratory viruses was observed in the raw sewage samples. The low percentage of positivity in the clinical specimens, the concentration method of the raw sewage samples, and the indirect routes of transmission may be the reasons for the absence of respiratory viruses in raw sewage samples. On the other hand, enteric adenoviruses were detected in 21/24 (87.5%) of the raw sewage samples with a higher prevalence of adenovirus type 41 than adenovirus type 40. A direct route of transmission of enteric viruses to raw sewage may be the reason for the high positivity percentage of enteric adenoviruses in raw sewage samples.","El-Senousy, Waled Morsy; Shouman, Mohamed",Food Environ Virol,204,29

Here, we characterize the MHV budding compartment in more detail in mouse L cells using streptolysin O (SLO) permeabilization which allowed us to better visualize the membrane structures at the ER-Golgi boundary. The MHV budding compartment shares membrane continuities with the rough ER as well as with cisternal elements on one side of the Golgi stack. It also labeled with p58 and rab2, two markers of the intermediate compartment, and with PDI, usually considered to be a marker of the rough ER. The membranes of the budding compartment, as well as the budding virions themselves, but not the rough ER, labeled with the N-acetyl- galactosamine (GalNAc)-specific lectin Helix pomatia. When the SLO- permeabilized cells were treated with guanosine 5'-(3-O- thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S), the budding compartment accumulated a large number of beta-cop-containing buds and vesicular profiles. Complementary biochemical experiments were carried out to determine whether vesicular transport was required for the newly synthesized M protein, that contains only O-linked oligosaccharides, to acquire first, GalNAc and second, the Golgi modifications galactose and sialic acid. The results from both in vivo studies and from the use of SLO- permeabilized cells showed that, while GalNAc addition occurred under conditions which block vesicular transport, both cytosol and ATP were prerequisites for the M protein oligosaccharides to acquire Golgi modifications. Collectively, our data argue that transport from the rough ER to the Golgi complex requires only one vesicular transport step and that the intermediate compartment is a specialized domain of the endoplasmatic reticulum that extends to the first cisterna on the cis side of the Golgi stack.",,J Cell Biol,204,1

Nous présentons les résultats d’une analyse TEP cérébrale au 18F-FDG chez des patients avec un diagnostic biologique confirmé d’infection SARS-CoV-2 et des plaintes fonctionnelles persistantes au moins 3 semaines après l’infection initiale. Méthode Les TEP cérébraux de 35 patients atteints de COVID long ont été comparés, en utilisant une analyse cerveau-entier à l’échelle de chaque voxel, à 44 sujets sains contrôlés pour l’âge et le sexe. Les anomalies TEP ont été confrontées aux caractéristiques des patients. Résultats Par rapport aux sujets sains, les patients avec COVID long présentaient un hypométabolisme bilatéral fronto-basal incluant le bulbe olfactif, le lobe temporal droit comprenant l’amygdale et l’hippocampe s’étendant jusqu’au thalamus droit, le tronc cérébral bulbo-protubérantiel et le cervelet bilatéral (p-voxel<0,001, p-cluster<0,05 FWE corrigé). Ces clusters métaboliques étaient discriminants pour distinguer les patients des sujets sains (classification correcte à 100 %). Ils étaient associés à des plaintes fonctionnelles plus nombreuses et à la survenue des symptômes (anosmie, troubles cognitifs, douleurs, insomnie) (p < 0,05). Le métabolisme du cluster frontal, qui comprenait le bulbe olfactif, était encore plus diminué chez les 7 patients traités par des médicaments ciblant ACE dans un contexte d’HTA (p = 0,032) et moins diminué chez les 3 patients ayant effectué des irrigations nasales au stade inital (p < 0,001). Cette étude démontre un profil d’hypométabolisme cérébral TEP chez des patients COVID long avec une infection SARS-CoV-2 démontrée biologiquement et des plaintes fonctionnelles persistantes plus de 3 semaines.

This pandemic overlaps with the ongoing epidemics of cigarette smoking and electronic cigarette (e-cig) vaping, with over 1 billion smokers and vapers worldwide. However, there is scarce data relating COVID-19 risks and outcome with cigarette or e-cig use. In this study, we mined 3 independent RNA expression datasets from smokers and vapers to understand the potential relationship between vaping/smoking and the dysregulation of key genes and pathways related to COVID-19. We found that smoking, but not vaping, upregulates ACE2, the cellular receptor that SARS-CoV-2 requires for infection. Both smoking and use of nicotine and flavor-containing e-cig led to upregulations of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression of genes related to inflammasomes. Vaping flavor-less and nicotine-less e-cig, however, did not lead to significant cytokine dysregulation and inflammasome activation. Release of inflammasome products, such as IL-1B, and cytokine storms are hallmarks of COVID-19 infection, especially in severe cases. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that smoking or vaping, specifically use of flavored or nicotine-containing e-cigs, may critically exacerbate COVID-19-related inflammation or increase susceptibility to the disease. Further scientific and public health investigations should be undertaken to address these concerning links between COVID-19 and e-cig/smoking.","Lee, Abby C.; Chakladar, Jaideep; Li, Wei Tse; Chen, Chengyu; Chang, Eric Y.; Wang-Rodriguez, Jessica; Ongkeko, Weg M.",bioRxiv,204,24

Over- or under-substitution carries the risk of increased morbidity in the form of side effects or adrenal crises. Glucocorticoid replacement therapy needs to be flexible with dose adaptation in special situations. This could not be managed by medical personnel on a daily basis, but requires an educated patient who has a good knowledge of the disease, understands his medical therapy and is able to perform situational dose adaptation. The rarity of the disease in combination with the need to respond to stressful situations with rapid glucocorticoid dose adjustment underlines that a well-trained patient is crucial for optimal management of the disease. In this literature review we provide background information further clarifying the need of education in patients with AI including the current shortcomings of medical therapy and of the treatment of patients with AI. We outline the aims of therapeutic patient education, present the concept of structured patient education in Germany, and discuss available results of patient group education programs.

METHODS: We examined early responses of IL-37, a powerful anti-inflammatory cytokine, in 254 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients prior to any clinical intervention and determined its correlation with clinical prognosis. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes elevation of plasma IL-37. Higher early IL-37 responses correlated with earlier viral RNA negative conversion, chest CT image improvement and cough relief, consequently resulted in earlier hospital discharge. Further assays showed that higher IL-37 was associated with lower IL-6 and IL-8 and higher IFN-α and facilitated biochemical homeostasis. Low IL-37 responses predicted severe clinical prognosis in combination with IL-8 and CRP. In addition, we observed that IL-37 administration was able to attenuate lung inflammation and alleviate respiratory tissue damage in human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)-transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that IL-37 plays a protective role by antagonizing inflammatory responses while retaining type I IFN, thereby maintaining the functionalities of vital organs. IL-37, IL-8 and CRP might be formulated as a precise prediction model for screening severe clinical cases and have good value in clinical practice.","Li, Ang; Ling, Yun; Song, Zhigang; Cheng, Xiaobo; Ding, Longfei; Jiang, Rendi; Fu, Weihui; Liu, Yan; Hu, Huiliang; Yuan, Songhua; Chen, Jian; Zhu, Cuisong; Fan, Jun; Wang, Jing; Jin, Yanling; Zhang, Miaomiao; Zhu, Lingyan; Sun, Peng; Zhang, Linxia; Qin, Ran; Zhang, Wei; Qiu, Chenli; Shen, Yinzhong; Zhang, Lin; Shi, Zhengli; Zhao, Chen; Zhu, Tongyu; Lu, Hongzhou; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Xu, Jianqing",J Infect Dis,204,1

The human B-cell response to natural influenza virus infection has not been extensively investigated at the polyclonal level. Methods. The overall B-cell response of patients acutely infected with the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (A[H1N1]pdm09) was analyzed by determining the reactivity of plasmablast-derived polyclonal antibodies (PPAbs) to influenza proteins. Recipients of inactivated influenza vaccine containing the same A(H1N1)pdm09 strain were studied for comparison. Results. During acute infection, robust plasmablast responses to the infecting virus were detected, characterized by a greater PPAb reactivity to the conserved influenza virus nuclear protein and to heterovariant and heterosubtypic hemagglutinins, in comparison to responses to the inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine. In A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccinees, the presence of baseline serum neutralizing antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09, suggesting previous exposure to natural A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, did not affect the plasmablast response to vaccination, whereas repeated immunization with inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine resulted in significantly reduced vaccine-specific and cross-reactive PPAb responses. Conclusions. Natural A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination result in very distinct patterns of B-cell activation and priming. These differences are likely to be associated with differences in protective immunity, especially cross-protection against heterovariant and heterosubtypic influenza virus strains.","He, Xiao-Song; Holmes, Tyson H.; Sanyal, Mrinmoy; Albrecht, Randy A.; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Dekker, Cornelia L.; Davis, Mark M.; Greenberg, Harry B.",Journal of Infectious Diseases,204,20

Use of the aerosol box led to statistically significant increases in intubation times (Wilcoxon-Signed Rank test p < 0.001, z-score = 3.921), with the calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r = 0.877) indicating a large effect size. An 8.5 - 11.5 second difference in median intubation times was maintained between corresponding attempts with versus without the aerosol box. 15 participants completed an optional post-assessment survey, with 10 of 15 respondents firmly stating they would not use the box in clinical practice. The hand accelerometry assessment included five anesthesiology providers from our institution. This revealed a statistically significant increase in trials with aerosol boxes for the left hand’s general accelerometry with a medium effect size (p = 0.031; z = -1.873; r = -0.484), as well as for the right hand’s general accelerometry with a large effect size (p < 0.001; z = -3.351; r = -0.865).

SARS-CoV-2 is typically collected by nasopharyngeal swab and detected by PCR; however, patients can test positive for 3 months after infection. Without the ability to assay SARS-CoV-2 in human breath, it is not possible to learn the transmission risk from infected individuals. To detect virus in breath, the Bubbler - a breathalyzer that reverse transcribes RNA from airborne SARS-CoV-2 particles into a sample-specific barcoded cDNA was developed. Tests of the Bubbler on 70 patients admitted to Rhode Island Hospital showed that it was both more predictive of lower respiratory track involvement (i.e. abnormal chest X-rays) and less invasive than alternatives. In addition, the Bubbler sample of exhaled air was 3 times more enriched for SARS-CoV-2 RNA than tongue swabs implying viral particles were being directly sampled. The demonstration of how barcode-enabled Bubblers can simultaneously diagnose large batches of pooled samples at a detection limit of 334 genomic copies/sample was given. Diagnosis by sequencing can provide additional information such as viral load and strain identity. Finally, the Bubbler was configured to sample nucleic acids in water droplets circulating in air, demonstrating this device’s potential for environmental monitoring and the protective effect of adequate ventilation.","Duan, Chaorui; Buerer, Luke; Wang, Jing; Kaplan, Samuel; Sabalewski, Gavin; Jay, Gregory D.; Monaghan, Sean; Arena, Andrea E.; Fairbrother, William G.",J Mol Diagn,204,1

Objectives To evaluate systemic and mucosal antibody responses toward SARS-CoV-2 in mild versus severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Methods Using immunoassays specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, we determined SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) in sera and mucosal fluids of two cohorts, including SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)+ patients (n = 64) as well as PCR+ and PCR– healthcare workers (n = 109). Results SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA titers in mild COVID-19 cases were often transiently positive, whereas serum IgG titers remained negative or became positive 12–14 days after symptom onset. Conversely, patients with severe COVID-19 showed a highly significant increase of SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA and IgG titers after symptom onset. Very high titers of SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA correlated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Interestingly, some healthcare workers with negative SARS-CoV-2-specific serum antibody titers showed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA in mucosal fluids with virus-neutralizing capacity in some cases. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA titers in nasal fluids inversely correlated with age. Conclusions Systemic antibody production against SARS-CoV-2 develops mainly in severe COVID-19, with very high IgA titers seen in patients with severe ARDS, whereas mild disease may be associated with transient production of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies but stimulate mucosal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA secretion.","Cervia, Carlo; Nilsson, Jakob; Zurbuchen, Yves; Valaperti, Alan; Schreiner, Jens; Wolfensberger, Aline; Raeber, Miro E.; Adamo, Sarah; Weigang, Sebastian; Emmenegger, Marc; Hasler, Sara; Bosshard, Philipp P.; De Cecco, Elena; Bächli, Esther; Rudiger, Alain; Stüssi-Helbling, Melina; Huber, Lars C.; Zinkernagel, Annelies S.; Schaer, Dominik J.; Aguzzi, Adriano; Kochs, Georg; Held, Ulrike; Probst-Müller, Elsbeth; Rampini, Silvana K.; Boyman, Onur",J Allergy Clin Immunol,204,24

The study aimed to develop a novel predictor called cumulative oxygen deficit (COD) for the risk stratification. METHODS: The study was conducted in four designated hospitals for treating COVID-19 patients in Jingmen, Wuhan, from January to March 2020. COD was defined to account for both the magnitude and duration of hypoxemia. A higher value of COD indicated more oxygen deficit. The predictive performance of COD was calculated in multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: A number of 111 patients including 80 in the non-IMV group and 31 in the IMV group were included. Patients with IMV had substantially lower PaO(2) (62 (49, 89) vs. 90.5 (68, 125.25) mmHg; p < 0.001), and higher COD (−6.87 (−29.36, 52.38) vs. −231.68 (−1040.78, 119.83) mmHg·day) than patients without IMV. As compared to patients with COD < 0, patients with COD > 30 mmHg·day had higher risk of fatality (HR: 3.79, 95% CI [2.57–16.93]; p = 0.037), and those with COD > 50 mmHg·day were 10 times more likely to die (HR: 10.45, 95% CI [1.28–85.37]; p = 0.029).

Disease prevention relies on the so-called “Infection and Treatment Method” (ITM), which is costly, complex, laborious, difficult to standardise on a commercial scale and results in a parasite strain-specific, MHC class I-restricted cytotoxic T cell response. We therefore attempted to develop a safe, affordable, stable, orally applicable and potent subunit vaccine for ECF using five different T. parva schizont antigens (Tp1, Tp2, Tp9, Tp10 and N36) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an expression platform. Full-length Tp2 and Tp9 as well as fragments of Tp1 were successfully expressed on the surface of S. cerevisiae. In vitro analyses highlighted that recombinant yeast expressing Tp2 can elicit IFNγ responses using PBMCs from ITM-immunized calves, while Tp2 and Tp9 induced IFNγ responses from enriched bovine CD8(+) T cells. A subsequent in vivo study showed that oral administration of heat-inactivated, freeze-dried yeast stably expressing Tp2 increased total murine serum IgG over time, but more importantly, induced Tp2-specific serum IgG antibodies in individual mice compared to the control group. While these results will require subsequent experiments to verify induction of protection in neonatal calves, our data indicates that oral application of yeast expressing Theileria antigens could provide an affordable and easy vaccination platform for sub-Saharan Africa. Evaluation of antigen-specific cellular immune responses, especially cytotoxic CD8(+) T cell immunity in cattle will further contribute to the development of a yeast-based vaccine for ECF.","Goh, Shan; Kolakowski, Jeannine; Holder, Angela; Pfuhl, Mark; Ngugi, Daniel; Ballingall, Keith; Tombacz, Kata; Werling, Dirk",Front Immunol,204,33

Molecular assays on nasopharyngeal swabs remain the cornerstone of COVID-19 diagnostic. Despite massive worldwide efforts, the high technicalities of nasopharyngeal sampling and molecular assays, as well as scarce resources of reagents, limit our testing capabilities. Several strategies failed, to date, to fully alleviate this testing process (e.g. saliva sampling or antigen testing on nasopharyngeal samples). We assessed the performances of a new ELISA microplate assay quantifying SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (N-antigen) in serum or plasma. Methods. The specificity of the assay, determined on 63 non-COVID patients, was 98.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 85.3 to 100). Performances were determined on 227 serum samples from 165 patients with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection included in the French COVID and CoV-CONTACT cohorts. Findings. Sensitivity was 132/142, 93.0% (95% CI, 84.7 to 100), within the first two weeks after symptoms onset. A subset of 73 COVID-19 patients had a serum collected within 24 hours following or preceding a positive nasopharyngeal swab. Among patients with high nasopharyngeal viral loads, Ct value below 30 and 33, only 1/50 and 4/67 tested negative for N-antigenemia, respectively. Among patients with a negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR, 8/12 presented positive N-antigenemia. The lower respiratory tract was explored for 6/8 patients, showing positive PCR in 5 cases. Interpretation. This is the first demonstration of the N-antigen antigenemia during COVID-19. Its detection presented a robust sensitivity, especially within the first 14 days after symptoms onset and high nasopharyngeal viral loads.

The complex molecular cascade of events related to the viral pathogenicity is triggered by the Spike protein upon interacting with the ACE2 receptor on human lung cells through its receptor binding domain (RBD(Spike)). One potential therapeutic strategy to combat COVID-19 could thus be limiting the infection by blocking this key interaction. In this current study, we adopt a protein design approach to predict and propose non-virulent structural mimics of the RBD(Spike) which can potentially serve as its competitive inhibitors in binding to ACE2. The RBD(Spike) is an independently foldable protein domain, resilient to conformational changes upon mutations and therefore an attractive target for strategic re-design. Interestingly, in spite of displaying an optimal shape fit between their interacting surfaces (attributed to a consequently high mutual affinity), the RBD(Spike)–ACE2 interaction appears to have a quasi-stable character due to a poor electrostatic match at their interface. Structural analyses of homologous protein complexes reveal that the ACE2 binding site of RBD(Spike) has an unusually high degree of solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues, attributed to key evolutionary changes, making it inherently “reaction-prone.” The designed mimics aimed to block the viral entry by occupying the available binding sites on ACE2, are tested to have signatures of stable high-affinity binding with ACE2 (cross-validated by appropriate free energy estimates), overriding the native quasi-stable feature. The results show the apt of directly adapting natural examples in rational protein design, wherein, homology-based threading coupled with strategic “hydrophobic ↔ polar” mutations serve as a potential breakthrough.

The main concern is the emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, it is important to find new approaches to prevent or reduce the virulence and pathogenicity of the virus. Currently, the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood. Considering the clinical effects that occur during the disease, attacking the human respiratory and hematopoietic systems, and the changes in biochemical parameters (including decreases in haemoglobin [Hb] levels and increases in serum ferritin), it is clear that iron metabolism is involved. SARS-CoV-2 induces haemolysis and interacts with Hb molecules via ACE2, CD147, CD26, and other receptors located on erythrocytes and/or blood cell precursors that produce dysfunctional Hb. A molecular docking study has reported a potential link between the virus and the beta chain of haemoglobin and attack on haem. Considering that haem is involved in miRNA processing by binding to the DCGR8-DROSHA complex, we hypothesised that the virus may check this mechanism and thwart the antiviral response.","Rapozzi, Valentina; Juarranz, Angeles; Habib, Ahsan; Ihan, Alojz; Strgar, Rebeka",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,204,16

Unfortunately there is no vaccine to prevent from novel coronavirus infection. Beside several experimental drugs, the strong immune responses and convalescent sera are the current two potential options to tackle COVID-19 infection. Innate immune-mediated antiviral responses is initiated by the recognition of viral invasion through PAMPs. In coronavirus the pathogen associated molecular patterns are recognized by toll like receptors (TLR-3 & 7), endosomal ribonucleic acid receptors, RNA in cytosol and by pattern recognition receptor (PRR RIG-1) in the alveolar cells and site of invasion. Nuclear factor (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory transcription factor (IRF3) are activated in response to above recognition episode and translocate to nucleus. These transcription factors in the nucleus initiate the expression of interferon type 1 and pro-inflammatory cytokine storm, which leads to first line of defense at the site of viral entrance. The effectiveness of innate immune system is greatly relies on type 1 interferons and its cascade, because of their role in inhibition of viral replication and initiation of adaptive immune responses. The successful interferon type 1 response put down the viral replication and transmission at prompt point. Passive immunization is the administering of antibodies into infected patients which is taken from recovered individuals. The convalescent sera of the recovered COVID-19 patients are containing antiviral neutralizing antibodies and is used therapeutically for infected individuals by SARS-CoV-2 and for the purpose of prophylaxis in exposed individuals. The convalescent sera is found effective when administered early at the onset of symptoms.","Abdullah, Abdullah; Faisal, Shah; Aman, Komal; Rahman, Anees ur",Antib Ther,204,20

The LOT-R optimism questionnaire, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) and the Competitive Anxiety Scale (SAS-2) were applied to a sample of 189 participants (139 men and 50 womwn) aged between 14 and 17 years. The following statistical tests are performed: Cronbach's alpha, Pearson's linear correlation, Student's t-test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Levene's test and multivariate linear regression. The data indicate that there are significant gender differences in total anxiety (p <0.001) and all its dimensions (somatic, worry, worry-free), also in optimism and pessimism (p < 0.001), as well as in total engagement (p = 0.051) and the absorption dimension (p < 0.001). When comparing the sample by sport categories, there are statistically significant differences in somatic anxiety (p = 0.036) and deconcentration (p = 0.034), as well as in LOT-total (p ≤ 0.001) and pessimism (p ≤ 0.001). In relation to the sport modalities, lifeguards show more anxiety 38.39 (0.49) and more commitment 4.58 (0.87) while futsal athletes reach higher scores in deconcentration 8.45 (2.29). It is concluded that the variables of commitment and resilience had a statistically significant positive effect, and the category of <16 years had a statistically significant negative effect, so the lower the category, the higher the optimism.","Cano-Noguera, Francisco; Ibáñez-Pérez, Ricardo José; Cavas-García, Francisco; Martínez-Moreno, Alfonso",Front Psychol,204,15

The information void has been especially stark in the World Health Organization Africa Region, which has low per capita reported cases, low testing rates, low access to therapeutic drugs, and has the longest wait for vaccines. As with all disease, the central challenge in responding to COVID-19 is that it requires integrating complex health systems that incorporate prevention, testing, front line health care, and reliable data to inform policies and their implementation within a relevant timeframe. It requires that the population can rely on the health system, and decision-makers can rely on the data. To understand the process and challenges of such an integrated response in an under-resourced rural African setting, we present the COVID-19 strategy in Ifanadiana District, where a partnership between Malagasy Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) and non-governmental organizations integrates prevention, diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment, in the context of a model health system. These efforts touch every level of the health system in the district—community, primary care centers, hospital—including the establishment of the only RT-PCR lab for SARS-CoV-2 testing outside of the capital. Starting in March of 2021, a second wave of COVID-19 occurred in Madagascar, but there remain fewer cases in Ifanadiana than for many other diseases (e.g., malaria). At the Ifanadiana District Hospital, there have been two deaths that are officially attributed to COVID-19. Here, we describe the main components and challenges of this integrated response, the broad epidemiological contours of the epidemic, and how complex data sources can be developed to address many questions of COVID-19 science. Because of data limitations, it still remains unclear how this epidemic will affect rural areas of Madagascar and other developing countries where health system utilization is relatively low and there is limited capacity to diagnose and treat COVID-19 patients. Widespread population based seroprevalence studies are being implemented in Ifanadiana to inform the COVID-19 response strategy as health systems must simultaneously manage perennial and endemic disease threats.","Rakotonanahary, Rado J.

Antibody-mediated protection may involve immune system recruitment through Fc-dependent activation of effector cells and the complement system. However, the role of Fc-mediated functions in the efficacious in vivo neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet clear. Delineating the role this process plays in antibody-mediated protection will have a great impact on the design of such therapeutics. Here, the Fc of two highly potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies, targeting distinct domains of the spike, was engineered to abrogate their Fc-dependent functions. The protective activity of these antibodies was tested against lethal SARS-CoV-2 infections in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice, both before or two days post-exposure in comparison to their original, Fc-active antibodies. Antibody treatment with both Fc-variants similarly rescued the mice from death, reduced viral load and prevented signs of morbidity. In addition, surviving animals developed a significant endogenous immune response towards the virus. Taken together, this work provides important insight regarding the contribution of Fc-effector functions in antibody-mediated protection, which should aid in future design of effective antibody-based therapies.","Noy-Porat, Tal; Edri, Avishay; Alcalay, Ron; Makdasi, Efi; Gur, David; Aftalion, Moshe; Evgy, Yentl; Beth-Din, Adi; Levy, Yinon; Epstein, Eyal; Radinsky, Olga; Zauberman, Ayelet; Lazar, Shirley; Yitzhaki, Shmuel; Marcus, Hadar; Porgador, Angel; Rosenfeld, Ronit; Mazor, Ohad",bioRxiv,204,1

One such factor might be the seaweed-rich diet commonly consumed in Japan. COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface and downregulates ACE2, likely elevating the ratio of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to ACE2. The overreaction of the immune system, combined with the cytokine storm and ACE dominance, is purported to cause the condition of COVID-19 patients to deteriorate rapidly. Dietary seaweeds contain numerous components, including ACE inhibitory peptides, soluble dietary fibers (eg, fucoidan, porphyran), omega-3 fatty acids, fucoxanthin, fucosterol, vitamins D(3) and B(12), and phlorotannins. These components exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral effects directly as well as indirectly through prebiotic effects. It is possible that ACE inhibitory components could minimize the ACE dominance caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, dietary seaweeds might confer protection against COVID-19 through multiple mechanisms. Overconsumption of seaweeds should be avoided, however, as seaweeds contain high levels of iodine.","Tamama, Kenichi",Nutr Rev,204,27

From January 23 through February 3, 2020, a total of 35 (64.8%) of 54 reported cases were imported from COVID-19–epidemic areas. Characteristics that differed significantly during the first and second waves of illness in Gansu Province were mean patient age, occupation, having visited epidemic areas, and mode of transportation. Time from infection to illness onset for family clusters was shorter in Gansu Province than in Wuhan, consistent with shortened durations from onset to first medical visit or hospitalization. Spatial distribution pattern analysis indicated hot spots and spatial outliers in Gansu Province.

All biopharmaceutical processes are required to have at least two distinct viral clearance steps to remove viruses. Most of these steps work well for enveloped viruses and large viruses, whether enveloped or not. That leaves a class of small non‐enveloped viruses, like parvoviruses and hepatitis A, which are not easily removed by these typical steps. In this study, we report the identification of trimeric peptides that bind specifically to porcine parvovirus (PPV) and their potential use to remove this virus from process solutions. All of the trimeric peptides isolated completely removed all detectable PPV from buffer in the first nine column volumes, corresponding to a clearance of 4.5–5.5 log of infectious virus. When the virus was spiked into a more complex matrix consisting of 7.5% human blood plasma, one of the trimers, WRW, was able to remove all detectable PPV in the first three column volumes, after which human blood plasma began to interfere with the binding of the virus to the peptide resin. These trimer resins removed considerably more virus than weak ion exchange resins. The results of this work indicate that small peptide ligand resins have the potential to be used in virus removal processes where removal of contaminating virus is necessary to ensure product safety.","Heldt, Caryn L.; Gurgel, Patrick V.; Jaykus, Lee‐Ann; Carbonell, Ruben G.",Biotechnol Prog,204,1

However, the interaction paradigms among users and feed algorithms greatly vary across social media platforms. This paper explores the key differences between the main social media platforms and how they are likely to influence information spreading and echo chambers’ formation. We perform a comparative analysis of more than 100 million pieces of content concerning several controversial topics (e.g., gun control, vaccination, abortion) from Gab, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter. We quantify echo chambers over social media by two main ingredients: 1) homophily in the interaction networks and 2) bias in the information diffusion toward like-minded peers. Our results show that the aggregation of users in homophilic clusters dominate online interactions on Facebook and Twitter. We conclude the paper by directly comparing news consumption on Facebook and Reddit, finding higher segregation on Facebook.","Cinelli, Matteo; De Francisci Morales, Gianmarco; Galeazzi, Alessandro; Quattrociocchi, Walter; Starnini, Michele",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,204,24

We find an excess mortality that is correlated in time with the COVID-19 reported death rate time series. Our analysis shows good agreement with reported COVID-19 mortality for age<70 years, but an excess in total mortality increasing with age above 70 years, suggesting there is a large population of predominantly old people missing from the official fatality statistics. We estimate that the number of COVID-19 deaths in Italy is 52,000 ± 2000 as of April 18 2020, more than a factor of 2 higher than the official number. The Population Fatality Rate (PFR) has reached 0.22% in the most affected region of Lombardia and 0.57% in the most affected province of Bergamo,which constitutes a lower bound to the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR). We estimate PFR as a function of age, finding a steep age dependence: in Lombardia (Bergamo province) 0.6% (1.7%) of the total population in age group 70-79 died, 1.6% (4.6%) in age group 80-89, and 3.41% (10.2%) in the age group above 90. We combine this with the Test Positivity Rate to estimate the lower bound of 0.84% on the IFR for Lombardia. We observe IFR to trace the Yearly Mortality Rate (YMR) above 60 years, which can be used to estimate the IFR for other regions in the world. We predict an IFR lower bound of 0.5% for NYC and 26% of total COVID-19 mortality arising from the population below 65 years, in agreement with the existing data and several times higher than Lombardia. Combining PFR with the Princess Diamond cruise ship IFR for ages above 70 we estimate the infection rates(IR) of regions in Italy, which peak in Lombardia at 23% (12%-41%, 95% c.l.), and for provinces in Bergamo at 67% (33%-100%, 95% c.l.). This suggests that Bergamo may have reached herd immunity, and that the number of infected people greatly exceeds the number of positive tests, by a factor of 35 in Lombardia.","Modi, Chirag; Boehm, Vanessa; Ferraro, Simone; Stein, George; Seljak, Uros",,204,16
