201438,"COVID-19 Pandemic: Epidemiology, Etiology, Conventional and Non-Conventional Therapies",2020,"Swine infectious agents, especially viruses, are potential public health risks associated with the use of pig organs for xenotransplantation in humans. Therefore, there is a need for better characterization of swine viruses and for the development of diagnostic tests for their detection. We report here isolation of a novel strain of porcine circovirus (PCV) from pigs with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). Affected pigs exhibited severe interstitial pneumonia and lymphoid depletion. The complete nucleotide sequence (1,768 nucleotides) of the genome of the PCV isolate was determined and compared with the sequence of the PCV strain isolated from PK-15 cells. Sequence comparison revealed significant differences between the two PCV strains, with an overall DNA homology of 76%. Two major open reading frames (ORFs) were identified. ORF1 was more conserved between the two strains, with 83% nucleotide homology and 86% amino acid homology. ORF2 was more variable, with nucleotide homology of 67% and amino acid homology of 65%. PCR and in situ hybridization demonstrated abundant viral DNA in various organs of pigs with PMWS. In situ hybridization demonstrated that this strain of PCV targets multiple organs and infects macrophages, lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells.","Morozov, I; Sirinarumitr, T; Sorden, S D; Halbur, P G; Morgan, M K; Yoon, K J; Paul, P S",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9705388/,947

By studying vaccinations against Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (mRNA-based) we found acute increases of type-I interferon-inducible gene expression, oxidative stress and DNA damage accumulation in blood mononuclear cells of 9 healthy controls, coupled with effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody production in all. Increased DNA damage after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, partly due to increased oxidative stress, was transient, whereas the inherent DNA repair capacity was found intact. In contrast, in 26 patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, who served as controls in the context of chronic immune activation, we validated increased DNA damage accumulation, increased type-I interferon-inducible gene expression and induction of oxidative stress, however aberrant DDR was associated with deficiencies in nucleotide excision repair pathways. These results indicate that acute immune challenge can indeed activate DDR pathways, whereas, contrary to chronic immune challenge, successful repair of DNA lesions occurs.","Ntouros, Panagiotis A; Vlachogiannis, Nikolaos I; Pappa, Maria; Nezos, Adrianos; Mavragani, Clio P; Tektonidou, Maria G; Souliotis, Vassilis L; Sfikakis, Petros P",Clin Immunol,,947
326386,Influence of Meteorological Factors on the COVID-19 Transmission with Season and Geographic Location,2021,"OBJECTIVES: In Japan, the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was diagnosed on January 15, 2020 and subsequent infections rapidly increased. The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination program is the principal element of tuberculosis control in Japan. We investigated the impact of routine infant BCG vaccination on prevention of local COVID-19 spread. METHODS: Data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, annual routine infant BCG vaccine coverage (represented by the number of BCG vaccinations per live births), and other candidate factors in each prefecture were obtained from the official notifications database in Japan. We analysed the association of vaccine coverage with the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The BCG vaccine coverage in 1999-2002, 2004, and 2012 in five prefectures with no COVID-19 infections was significantly higher than that in five prefectures with a high prevalence of infections (Mann-Whitney U test, p<0.05). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly negatively correlated with BCG vaccine coverage in 2004 and was significantly positively correlated with age groups 20-34 and 40-54 years (Spearman's rank correlation, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that routine infant BCG vaccination coverage in young generation had a significant impact on prevention of local COVID-19 spread in Japan.","Kinoshita, Masako; Tanaka, Masami",J Infect,,947
331237,Naive Forecast for COVID-19 in Utah Based on the South Korea and Italy Models-the Fluctuation between Two Extremes,2020,"Current flu vaccines rely on the induction of strain-specific neutralizing antibodies, which leaves the population vulnerable to drifted seasonal or newly emerged pandemic strains. Therefore, universal flu vaccine approaches that induce broad immunity against conserved parts of influenza have top priority in research. Cross-reactive T cell responses, especially tissue-resident memory T cells in the respiratory tract, provide efficient heterologous immunity, and must therefore be a key component of universal flu vaccines. Here, we review recent findings about T cell-based flu immunity, with an emphasis on tissue-resident memory T cells in the respiratory tract of humans and different animal models. Furthermore, we provide an update on preclinical and clinical studies evaluating T cell-evoking flu vaccines, and discuss the implementation of T cell immunity in real-life vaccine policies.","Schmidt, Anna; Lapuente, Dennis",Viruses,,947

Quantum memory effect of localised shock wave on Minkowski metric is investigated here. We find that the Wightman function for massless scalar field, on both sides of the wave location, turns out to be the same for usual Minkowski spacetime. Therefore the observables obtained from this, for any kind of observer, do not show the signature of the shock. Moreover, the vacuum states of field on both sides are equivalent. On the contrary, the correlator for the non-vacuum state does memorise the classical shock wave and hence the effect of it is visible in the observables, even for any frame. We argue that rather than vacuum state, the non-vacuum ones are relevant to retrieve the quantum information of classical memory.","Majhi, Bibhas Ranjan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04486v1.pdf,947

Design: We performed a bench study. Setting: Dedicated research room as part of an ICU affiliated to a university hospital. Subjects: We set the lung model with three conditions of resistance and linear compliance for mimicking different respiratory mechanics of representative intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Interventions: The performance of the device was tested using the ASL5000 lung model. Measurements and Main Results: Twenty-seven conditions were tested. All the measurements fell within the ±10% limits for the tidal volume (VT). The volume error was influenced by the mechanical condition (p = 5.9 × 10−15) and the PEEP level (P = 1.1 × 10−12) but the clinical significance of this finding is likely meaningless (maximum −34 mL in the error). The PEEP error was not influenced by the mechanical condition (p = 0.25). Our experimental results demonstrate that the eSpiro ventilator is reliable to deliver VT and PEEP accurately in various respiratory mechanics conditions. Conclusions: We report a low-cost, easy-to-build ventilator, which is reliable to deliver VT and PEEP in passive invasive mechanical ventilation.","Terzi, Nicolas Rastello Fabrice Déhan Christophe Roux Marion Sigaud Florian Rigault Guillaume Fromentin Cyril Farrugia Adrien Guérin Claude",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,947

We considered factors linked to loneliness among 701 adults aged 50 years and older with chronic conditions from Michigan (82.5%) and 33 other U.S. states. Participants completed an anonymous online survey between May 14 and July 9, 2020. About two thirds (66.4%) reported moderate to severe loneliness. The fully adjusted regression model revealed that being a person of color, having a spouse or cohabiting partner, and more emotional support were associated with lower levels of loneliness. Higher anxiety symptoms, more worry about COVID-19 infection, and more financial strain because of the pandemic were linked to greater loneliness. These findings inform strategies to support a vulnerable subgroup of older adults during this pandemic and in future public health crises.","Polenick, Courtney A; Perbix, Emily A; Salwi, Shreya M; Maust, Donovan T; Birditt, Kira S; Brooks, Jessica M",J Appl Gerontol,,947

Rumors are unverified pieces of information spreading online or person-to-person that reduce trust in health authorities and create barriers to protective practices. Risk communication and community engagement can increase transparency, build trust, and stop the spread of rumors. Building on previous work on Ebola and Zika viruses using Global Health Security Agenda systems strengthening support, the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded Breakthrough ACTION project developed a process and technology for systematically collecting, analyzing, and addressing COVID-19 rumors in real-time in Côte d'Ivoire. Rumors were submitted through community-based contributors and collected from callers to the national hotlines and then processed on a cloud-hosted database built on the open-source software District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2). Hotline teleoperators and data managers coded rumors in near-real-time according to behavioral theory frameworks within DHIS2 and visualized the findings on custom dashboards. The analysis and response were done in full collaboration with the Government of Côte d'Ivoire and implementing partners to ensure a timely and coordinated response. The system captured both widespread rumors consistent with misinformation in other settings, such as suspicions about case counts and the belief that masks were deliberately contaminated, as well as very localized beliefs related to specific influencers. The qualitative findings provided rapid insights on circulating beliefs, enabling risk communicators to nuance and tailor messaging around COVID-19.","Tibbels, Natalie; Dosso, Abdul; Allen-Valley, Aliya; Benie, William; Fordham, Corinne; Brou, Jeanne Aka; Nana, Marjorie; Zounneme, Valère; Silué, Korodénin Fatoumata; Kamara, Diarra; Naugle, Danielle",Glob. health sci. pract,,947

This study assessed lifestyle changes across different BMI classifications in response to the global pandemic. METHODS: The online survey targeting adults was distributed in April 2020 and collected information on dietary behaviors, physical activity, and mental health. All questions were presented as ""before"" and ""since"" the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 7,753 participants were included; 32.2% of the sample were individuals with normal weight, 32.1% had overweight, and 34.0% had obesity. During the pandemic, overall scores for healthy eating increased (P < 0.001), owing to less eating out and increased cooking (P < 0.001). Sedentary leisure behaviors increased, while time spent in physical activity (absolute time and intensity adjusted) declined (P < 0.001). Anxiety scores increased 8.78 ± 0.21 during the pandemic, and the magnitude of increase was significantly greater in people with obesity (P &#8804; 0.01). Weight gain was reported in 27.5% of the total sample compared with 33.4% in participants with obesity.

METHODS: Epidemiological linking and analysis of cases of COVID-19 across multiple outbreak sites. RESULTS: Fifteen cases of COVID-19 and 41 contacts were identified and linked in a cluster that included one workplace and five households. The mean incubation period in the cases ranged from 4.6 to 6.4 days, while the median incubation period was shorter, ranging from 3 to 5 days. The overall range of incubation periods was 2 to 12 days. Differential attack rates were found within households (86% adults vs. 9% children) and workplace (32%) settings. Conclusions and implications for public health: Our investigation links cases between multiple households and a workplace. When exploring these links using a rapid workplace assessment, real-time cluster data along with objective measurements of exposure, such as with the Australian Government COVIDSafe app, may have allowed these links to be identified more readily and potentially reduced further spread of COVID-19. We found age as a factor for infection, with children being less likely to both acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection and to develop symptoms. This finding aids in our understanding of how the virus affects children and cautiously supports face-to-face classroom teaching.","Capon, Adam; Ousta, Dima; Ferson, Mark; Ingleton, Andrew; Sheppeard, Vicky",Aust N Z J Public Health,,947

CONCLUSIONS: Misconceptions about influenza disease and vaccine among Aboriginal people and inadequate identification of Aboriginality in general practice appear to be the greatest barriers to vaccination, rather than health service access in general. Implications for public health: More active communication to and targeting of Aboriginal adults is required; this is even more urgent following the arrival of COVID-19.","Menzies, Robert; Aqel, Jalil; Abdi, Ikram; Joseph, Telphia; Seale, Holly; Nathan, Sally Anne",Aust.
