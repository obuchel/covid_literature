Little is known about the disease burden in Laos. We aimed to evaluate the burden and outcomes of AKI as well as assess the availability of AKI treatment in Laos. METHODS: We performed a multicentric prospective observational study in adult patients who had been admitted to 5 intensive care units (ICU) in Laos. The data was serially collected on the first 28 days of ICU admission. Patients were diagnosed by the KDIGO 2012 criteria for AKI. We used AKI occurrence as the primary outcome and explored risk factors on the development and outcomes of AKI. RESULTS: We enrolled 1480 patients from 5 ICU centers across Laos from January to December 2016. After excluding patients with end-stage renal disease and those with incomplete data, AKI occurred in 508 of the 1460 enrolled patients (34.8%). Overall, the rates of maximum AKI staging were 4% for stage 1, 10.3% for stage 2, and 20.5% for stage 3. Risk factors for AKI were older age, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, renal diseases, oncologic diseases, and chronic kidney diseases. Only 1.8% of all participants received RRT. The mortality rate was 28.4% in non-AKI patients compared to 44.5% in AKI patients, which increased according to the stage of AKI (stage 1, 4.9%; stage 2, 28.3%; stage 3 66.8%; P < 0.001). There were 13.6% who were discharged against medical advice. CONCLUSIONS: AKI is a huge burden in Laos with under-recognition and poor outcomes.","Sengthavisouk, Noot; Lumlertgul, Nuttha; Keomany, Chanmaly; Banouvong, Phonepadith; Senavong, Phetvilay; Sayyaphet, Sidavone; Binbundith, Sakountala; Kulvichit, Win; Peerapornratana, Sadudee; Praditpornsilpa, Kearkiat; Tungsanga, Kriang; Eiam-Ong, Somchai; Srisawat, Nattachai",BMC Med,771,4

Contrary to other health care professions, clinical pharmacy practice is a new healthcare discipline in the country which is currently undergoing transition. The existing pharmacy curriculum and training in the country can provide competencies needed for pharmacists in industrial settings. Considering the importance of clinical pharmacists in patient care, the Government of Nepal has implemented a policy recommending the recruitment of clinical pharmacists in hospitals. However, the education and training for pharmacists provided in the country are not sufficient enough for optimum patient care and for delivering clinical pharmacy services. International collaborations in terms of faculty and student exchanges, preceptor training, and accreditation by international organizations such as Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), establishment of need-based curriculum, incorporating clinical pharmacy department under the organizational structure of hospitals, etc., may be the right approaches to improve the current status of clinical pharmacy education in the country.","Shrestha, Sunil; Shakya, Deepa; Palaian, Subish",Adv Med Educ Pract,771,1

In this article, we examine empirical data on the timing of policy responses from the Coronavirus Government Response Tracker to determine whether and how countries led by women reacted differently to the pandemic. Exploring the relationship between the gender of leaders and legislators and the timing of stay-at-home orders, school closures, and coordinated public information campaigns, we find no statistical evidence supporting popular claims in the media. However, we find some evidence that the level of gender equality in legislatures is related to school closures, a policy with clear gendered consequences.

However, to contribute to the many emergencies caused by the pandemic through purpose‐led actions, many of those firms have reacted with innovative projects and changes in their manufacturing activities. In this paper, we address why and how these efforts have been implemented and how the situation of these firms evolved after the peak of the health crisis. Drawing on the literature about the purpose and R&D/innovation management concerning health emergency, we develop a conceptual framework to understand how different types of purpose‐led actions (i.e., short term and/or long term) and different R&D management strategies (i.e., exploitation or exploration of R&D, innovation, and manufacturing competencies) can characterize firms’ rapid response for the benefit of the community in the fight against COVID‐19, for example through the provision of medical equipment or other products and services. We validate the framework using the cases of 21 Italian firms which have taken very fast actions during the peak of the COVID‐19 emergency.","Ferrigno, Giulio; Cucino, Valentina",,771,4

Because these patients have increased morbidity and mortality risks, they require immediate attention to determine the causes in order to provide appropriate treatment. This study aimed to investigate the causes and predictive factors of syncope as well as the methods used to diagnose syncope in cardiac pacemaker patients. METHODS Patients with pacemakers implanted owing to sinus node disease or atrioventricular block were evaluated with standardized questionnaires, endocavitary electrograms, and other tests based on the suspected causes of syncope. Mann- Whitney U tests were used to analyze continuous variables and Chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests were used for categorical variables. Logistic regression was used for multivariate analyses. Statistical significance was P<0.05. RESULTS The study included 95 patients with pacemakers: 47 experienced syncope in the last 12 months and 48 did not. Of the 100 documented episodes of syncope, 48.9% were vasovagal syncopes, 17% had cardiac-related causes, 10.6% had unknown causes, and 8.5% had pacemaker failure. The multivariate analysis showed that a New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II was a significant factor for developing syncope (P<0.01). CONCLUSION While the most common type of syncope in pacemaker patients was neurally mediated, it is important to perform detailed evaluations in this population as the causes of syncope can be life-threatening. The best diagnostic methods were stored electrogram analysis and the tilt table test. NYHA Functional Class II patients were found to have a higher risk for syncope.","Rocha, Eduardo Arrais; Cunha, Gisele Schineider; Tavares, Aline Bezerra; Viana, Antônio Brazil; Quidute, Ana Rosa Pinto; Pereira, Francisca Tatiana Moreira; Monteiro, Marcelo de Paula Martins; Rocha, Maria Eduarda Quidute Arrais; Gomes, Camila Rabelo Ferreira; Rodrigues, Carlos Roberto Martins",Brazilian journal of cardiovascular surgery,771,16

The ADFs are intended to prevent, impede or discourage physical and chemical tampering while still being able to provide safe and accurate delivery of an abusable medication for therapeutic benefit. AREAS COVERED This review primarily focuses on patents and company literature regarding the formulations, manufacturing and physiochemical properties of abuse-deterrent compositions. Also included are journal articles with relevance to the development of these novel technologies. Particular attention is given to oral dosage forms with applications found in prescription drug products, over-the-counter medications and proprietary technologies in development. Overall, the formulations of 14 drug products, 2 meth-resistant cold products and 17 pharmaceutical proprietary technologies are explored in detail. EXPERT OPINION Despite the introduction of a wide range of formulation and technology interventions with different deterrence potential, the progression of these technologies seems to be moving from inhibiting only one type of abuse to stopping multiple types of tampering methods. Information on inherent strengths and weaknesses of various formulations can be utilized in the development of more robust and resistant ADF in the future.","Mastropietro, David J; Omidian, Hossein",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,771,7

Due to the airborne nature of its transmission, COVID-19 has spread to the rest of the world rapidly. Thus, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Most of the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 are also seen in malaria and common colds. Most people have shown poor healthcare-seeking behaviour. For this reason, most people tend to self-medicate using medicines that are known to be effective against malaria, common colds, and COVID-19. Among the commonly used medicines in the practice of self-medication include antibacterials, antimalarials, and antivirals. Some vitamins such as vitamin C boost the immune system enabling it to provide effective defence mechanisms against foreign bodies such as microbes. Vitamin C is obtained from foodstuffs such as oranges, broccoli, cabbage, red pepper, cauliflower, spinach, tomatoes and tomato source, sweet and Irish potatoes. However, self-medication may pose consequences such as the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, hypersensitivity reactions as well as dose-dependent toxicities viz dermatoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and hepatoxicity. Infectious diseases caused by antimicrobial-resistant microbes are difficult and, in some instances, impossible to treat thereby leading to increased morbidity and mortality among infected people. Consequently, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses another global public health problem and requires a multisectoral approach to curb. It is our recommendation that all governments ensure that there are adequate medicines and efficient human resources in healthcare facilities as well as sufficient public awareness to prevent people from seeking self-medication.","Mudenda, S.; Hankombo, M.; Saleem, Z.; Sadiq, M.

This was accompanied by the suspension of all elective operations. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic on general and visceral surgery in university hospitals in Germany. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was based on an anonymous survey, which was accessible online from 3 April 2020 to 17 April 2020 for the surgical departments of university hospitals in Germany. In total 73% (nâ¯= 29/40) of the hospitals participated in the survey. RESULTS: Cooperation with the authorities and the hospital administration was generally considered adequate; however, only 3% (1/29) and 7% (2/29) fully agreed with the statement that the health authorities at the federal and state level, respectively, were supportive of general and visceral surgery. The hospital directors expect an average loss of revenues of 28â¯± 16%. There was an average reduction in beds or operating room capacity of 38% and 45%, respectively. In addition, 11% of the medical personnel in general and visceral surgery were reallocated to other departments. CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV­2 pandemic has a significant impact on academic general and visceral surgery in Germany.

Based on the operating parameters obtained in system exploitation, it is performed analysis of each system component individually, as well as analysis of the whole observed system. While observing all heat exchangers it is found that combustion gases-CO2 heat exchangers have the lowest exergy destructions and the highest exergy efficiencies (higher than 92%). The lowest exergy efficiency of all heat exchangers is detected in Cooler (51.84%). Observed system is composed of two gas turbines and two compressors. The analysis allows detection of dominant mechanical power producer and the dominant mechanical power consumer. It is also found that the turbines from the observed system have much higher exergy efficiencies in comparison to compressors (exergy efficiency of both turbines is higher than 94%, while exergy efficiency of both compressors did not exceed 87%). The whole observed waste heat recovery system has exergy destruction equal to 6270.73 kW, while the exergy efficiency of the whole system is equal to 64.12% at the selected ambient state. Useful mechanical power produced by the whole system and used for electrical generator drive equals 11204.80 kW.

METHODS: We examined characteristics and predictors of hospitalization and death in a nationwide cohort of all Danish individuals tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from 27 February 2020 until 19 May 2020. RESULTS: We identified 11 122 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction-positive cases of whom 80% were community-managed and 20% were hospitalized. Thirty-day all-cause mortality was 5.2%. Age was strongly associated with fatal disease {odds ratio [OR] 15 [95% confidence interval (CI): 9-26] for 70-79 years, increasing to OR 90 (95% CI: 50-162) for &#8805;90 years, when compared with cases aged 50-59 years and adjusted for sex and number of co-morbidities}. Similarly, the number of co-morbidities was associated with fatal disease [OR 5.2 (95% CI: 3.4-8.0), for cases with at least four co-morbidities vs no co-morbidities] and 79% of fatal cases had at least two co-morbidities. Most major chronic diseases were associated with hospitalization, with ORs ranging from 1.3-1.4 (e.g. stroke, ischaemic heart disease) to 2.6-3.4 (e.g. heart failure, hospital-diagnosed kidney disease, organ transplantation) and with mortality with ORs ranging from 1.1-1.3 (e.g. ischaemic heart disease, hypertension) to 2.5-3.2 (e.g. major psychiatric disorder, organ transplantation). In the absence of co-morbidities, mortality was <5% in persons aged &#8804;80 years. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide population-based COVID-19 study, increasing age and multimorbidity were strongly associated with hospitalization and death. In the absence of co-morbidities, the mortality was, however, <5% until the age of 80 years.","Reilev, Mette; Kristensen, Kasper Bruun; Pottegård, Anton; Lund, Lars Christian; Hallas, Jesper; Ernst, Martin Thomsen; Christiansen, Christian Fynbo; Sørensen, Henrik Toft; Johansen, Nanna Borup; Brun, Nikolai Constantin; Voldstedlund, Marianne; Støvring, Henrik; Thomsen, Marianne Kragh; Christensen, Steffen; Gubbels, Sophie; Krause, Tyra Grove; Mølbak, Kåre; Thomsen, Reimar Wernich",Int. j. epidemiol,771,26

Microscopically, the cultured cells showed fibroblast-like morphology. Phenotypically these cells expressed CD44, CD90, CD105 and the transcription factor PouV, which has been shown to be critical for stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency. The multipotency of chicken MSCs was demonstrated by their ability to undergo adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. Like chicken bone marrow MSCs and mammalian MSCs, chicken lung MSCs had immunoregulatory activity and profoundly suppressed the proliferative capacity of T cells in response to a mitogenic stimulus. Next, we examined the susceptibility of these cells to H1N1 and H9N5 avian influenza (AI) viruses. The lung MSCs were shown to express known influenza virus alpha-2,3 and alpha-2,6 sialic acid receptors and to support replication of both the avian H1N1 and avian H9N5 influenza strains. Viral infection of MSCs resulted in cell lysis and cytokine and chemokine production. Further characterization of lung MSCs in chicken and other mammalian species may help in understanding the pathogenesis of infectious and non-infectious lung diseases and the mechanisms of lung injury repair.","Khatri, Mahesh; O’Brien, Timothy D.; Goyal, Sagar M.; Sharma, Jagdev M.",Dev Comp Immunol,771,16

However, the related research of GBP1 in clinical management of lung adenocarcinoma is still lacking. Therefore, the present study aimed to detect the clinical role of GBP1 in lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The clinical data of 221 lung adenocarcinoma patients were retrospectively analyzed, and then, their tumor tissue specimens and paired adjacent tissue specimens were retrieved for GBP1 detection via immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay. RESULTS: GBP1 expression was upregulated in tumor tissues compared with adjacent tissues (P < .001). Moreover, high tumor GBP1 expression was associated with larger tumor size (P = .030), positive lymph node (LYN) metastasis (P = .001), advanced TNM stage (P = .001), and abnormal preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level (P = .026). Furthermore, tumor GBP1 high expression was correlated with reduced disease‐free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), and was of independent value in predicting worse DFS and OS. Additionally, data analysis of 1144 lung cancer patients derived from KMplot database (www.kmplot.com) further verified that GBP1 expression was negatively correlated with OS (P = .009). CONCLUSION: GBP1 correlates with advanced tumor features and worse survival profiles, suggesting its value to be a prognostic biomarker in management of lung adenocarcinoma.","Wan, Quanchao; Qu, Jingming; Li, Longfei; Gao, Feng",J Clin Lab Anal,771,1

The sudden outburst of the virus not only brought normal life to a halt but also made us more aware of health impacts and hygiene guidelines that should be strictly maintained. There is a direct human-to-human transmission of the virus, which happens with a lack of adequate infection controls and improper hygiene precautions. In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the concept of sewage epidemiology or water-based epidemiology holds significance to detect the virus’s presence in untreated sewage through fecal matter. In this context, this chapter is focused on a detailed discussion of municipal and health care wastewater characterization, methods of disinfection of viruses in wastewater treatment plants, and survival of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, urine, and biosolids. Usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), appropriate disinfection agents, training for the sanitary and health care workers as guided by the World Health Organization (WHO), and scientific safe disposal of biosolids could alleviate the indirect transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, there is also a dire need for reorientation of conventional wastewater treatment operations since there is a possibility of viral load in municipal wastewater from the household origin that has to be monitored by pollution control boards.","Jacob, Samuel; Mohapatra, Sneha; Siddharth, Ravi; Nag, Sukanya; Santhosh Venkat, Satish Kumar; Rajeswari, Gunasekaran",Environmental and Health Management of Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19 ),771,1

The trade in wild meat, and its role in diets, have been brought into focus as a consequence of discussions over the origins of COVID-19. As a result, there have been calls for the closure of China’s “wet markets”; greater scrutiny of the wildlife trade in general; and a spotlight has been placed on the potential risks posed by growing human populations and shrinking natural habitats for animal to human transmission of zoonotic diseases. However, to date there has been little attention given to what the consequences of the COVID-19 economic shock may be for the wildlife trade; the people who rely on it for their livelihoods; and the wildlife that is exploited. In this policy perspective, we argue that the links between the COVID-19 pandemic, rural livelihoods and wildlife are likely to be more complex, more nuanced, and more far-reaching, than is represented in the literature to date. We develop a causal model that tracks the likely implications for the wild meat trade of the systemic crisis triggered by COVID-19. We focus on the resulting economic shockwave, as manifested in the collapse in global demand for commodities such as oil, and international tourism services, and what this may mean for local African economies and livelihoods. We trace the shockwave through to the consequences for the use of, and demand for, wild meats as households respond to these changes. We suggest that understanding and predicting the complex dynamics of wild meat use requires increased collaboration between environmental and resource economics and the ecological and conservation sciences.","McNamara, James; Robinson, Elizabeth J.
