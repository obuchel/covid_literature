METHODS: We used the Delphi process with internal (RKI) and external experts and a metric-consensus approach to score pathogens according to ten three-tiered criteria. Additional experts were invited to weight each criterion, leading to the calculation of a median weight by which each score was multiplied. We ranked the pathogens according to the total weighted score and divided them into four priority groups. RESULTS: 127 pathogens were scored. Eighty-six experts participated in the weighting; “Case fatality rate” was rated as the most important criterion. Twenty-six pathogens were ranked in the highest priority group; among those were pathogens with internationally recognised importance (e.g., Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Influenza virus, Hepatitis C virus, Neisseria meningitides), pathogens frequently causing large outbreaks (e.g., Campylobacter spp.), and nosocomial pathogens associated with antimicrobial resistance. Other pathogens in the highest priority group included Helicobacter pylori, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Varicella zoster virus and Hantavirus. DISCUSSION: While several pathogens from the highest priority group already have a high profile in national and international health policy documents, high scores for other pathogens (e.g., Helicobacter pylori, Respiratory syncytial virus or Hantavirus) indicate a possible under-recognised importance within the current German public health framework. A process to strengthen respective surveillance systems and research has been started. The prioritization methodology has worked well; its modular structure makes it potentially useful for other settings.","Balabanova, Yanina; Gilsdorf, Andreas; Buda, Silke; Burger, Reinhard; Eckmanns, Tim; Gärtner, Barbara; Groß, Uwe; Haas, Walter; Hamouda, Osamah; Hübner, Johannes; Jänisch, Thomas; Kist, Manfred; Kramer, Michael H.; Ledig, Thomas; Mielke, Martin; Pulz, Matthias; Stark, Klaus; Suttorp, Norbert; Ulbrich, Uta; Wichmann, Ole; Krause, Gérard",PLoS One,221,1

The developed CAD system in this study is based on 1) fast localization of candidate imaging patterns using local scale information of the images, and 2) Möbius invariant feature extraction method based on learned local shape and texture properties of TIB patterns. For fast localization of candidate imaging patterns, we use ball-scale filtering and, based on the observation of the pattern of interest, a suitable scale selection is used to retain only small size patterns. Once candidate abnormality patterns are identified, we extract proposed shape features from regions where at least one candidate pattern occupies. The comparative evaluation of the proposed method with commonly used CAD methods is presented with a dataset of 60 chest CTs (laboratory confirmed 39 viral bronchiolitis human parainfluenza CTs and 21 normal chest CTs). The quantitative results are presented as the area under the receiver operator characteristics curves and a computer score (volume affected by TIB) provided as an output of the CAD system. In addition, a visual grading scheme is applied to the patient data by three well-trained radiologists. Interobserver and observer–computer agreements are obtained by the relevant statistical methods over different lung zones. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CAD system can achieve high detection rates with an overall accuracy of 90.96%. Moreover, correlations of observer–observer [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] and observer–CAD agreements [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] validate the feasibility of the use of the proposed CAD system in detecting and quantifying TIB patterns.","Bagci, Ulas; Yao, Jianhua; Wu, Albert; Caban, Jesus; Palmore, Tara N.; Suffredini, Anthony F.; Aras, Omer; Mollura, Daniel J.",IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,221,1

Radix Ginseng (RG), a traditional herb used as herbal remedy in eastern Asia for thousands of years, which has been traditionally used in China to improve blood circulation and ameliorate pathological hemostasis. This study investigated whether Ginsenoside Rb1, the main components of RG, can attenuate ALI induced by LPS. METHODS: In vivo, 30 male Wistar rats were divided into three groups (n = 10 each groups) on the basis of the reagent used, which were subjected to LPS injection with or without Ginsenoside Rb1 (5 mg/kg) treatments to induce ALI model. Lung injury was assessed by pulmonary histology, lung wet-weight to dry-weight (W/D) ratio, the number of myeloperoxidase (MPO) positive cells, immunohistochemical analysis of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), gene expression of ICAM-1, ultrastructure changes of pulmonary microvasculature, concentration of inflammatory markers and in plasma. In vitro, pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) were stimulated with LPS in the presence and absence of Ginsenoside Rb1 (50 mM), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 was measured by immunocytochemistry staining and western blotting. RESULTS: Infusion of LPS induced lung injury, in vivo, as demonstrated by pulmonary edema with infiltration of neutrophils and hemorrhage, the increase in lung W/D ratio, the number of MPO positive cells, the level of inflammatory markers such as TNF-α, MCP-1 and IL-8, enhanced expression of ICAM-1 and ICAM-1 gene. Moreover, resulted in the changes of intercellular junctions in the endothelial cells of pulmonary microvasculature. In vitro, the significant increased release of NF-κB p65 and its subsequent translocation into the nucleus in PMVECs were observed. In contrast, Ginsenoside Rb1 treatment significantly ameliorated the LPS-induced lung injury, as judged by the marked improvement in all these indices. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Ginsenoside Rb1 attenuated LPS-induced lung injury through an inhibition of the inflammatory signaling pathway, besides the direct inhibitory effect on proinflammatory molecules.","Yuan, Qing; Jiang, Yan-wen; Ma, Ting-ting; Fang, Qiu-hong; Pan, Lei",J Inflamm (Lond),221,1

METHODS: We conducted a community-based prospective cohort study from 2014 to 2016 in Biliran Province, the Philippines, on children <5 years old. We collected nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) during household visits and at health facilities. In households (n = 181) with RSV-positive ARI cases (RSV-ARI), we also identified ARI episodes among other children <5 years old in the same household. In addition, we determined the serial interval to estimate the basic reproduction number (R(0)), the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case. RESULTS: In the 181 households analyzed, we found 212 RSV-ARI in 152 households with a single case and 29 households with multiple cases, which included 29 1st RSV-ARI and 31 2nd RSV-ARI. We also found possible index cases among children <5 years old in the same household for 29.0% (18 of 62) of young infants with RSV-ARI. The estimated mean serial interval was 3.2 days, and R(0) was estimated to be 0.92–1.33 for RSV-A and 1.04–1.76 for RSV-B, which varied between different times (2014 and 2015) and places. CONCLUSIONS: Young infants are likely to acquire RSV infection from older children in the same household. Therefore, vaccination targeting older children might protect infants from RSV infection.","Otomaru, Hirono; Kamigaki, Taro; Tamaki, Raita; Okamoto, Michiko; Alday, Portia Parian; Tan, Alvin Gue; Manalo, Joanna Ina; Segubre-Mercado, Edelwisa; Inobaya, Marianette Tawat; Tallo, Veronica; Lupisan, Socorro; Oshitani, Hitoshi",Open Forum Infect Dis,221,3

Each peptide was synthesized in a discrete well (455 peptides/card). The two miniPEPSCAN libraries were screened with three different monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). Two other random peptide libraries, expressed on the wall of bacteria (recombinant libraries) and composed of 10(7) hexa- and octapeptides, were screened with the same three Mabs. The aim of this study was to compare the amino acid sequence of peptides selected from small and large pools of random peptides and, in this way, investigate the potential of small random peptide libraries. The screening of the two miniPEPSCAN libraries resulted in the identification of a surprisingly large number of antibody-binding peptides, while the screening of the large recombinant libraries, using the same Mabs, resulted in the identification of only a small number of peptides. The large number of peptides derived from the small random peptide libraries allowed the determination of consensus sequences. These consensus sequences could be related to small linear and nonlinear parts of the respective epitopes. The small number of peptides derived from the large random peptide libraries could only be related to linear epitopes that were previously mapped using small libraries of overlapping peptides covering the antigenic protein. Thus, with respect to the cost and speed of identifying peptides that resemble linear and nonlinear parts of epitopes, small diversity libraries based on synthetic peptides appear to be superior to large diversity libraries based on expression systems.","Slootstra, Jerry W.; Puijk, Wouter C.; Ligtvoet, Gerard J.; Langeveld, Jan P.

It encodes at least 10 proteins from eight negative-strand RNA segments. Since ISAV belongs to the same virus family as Influenza A virus, with similarities in protein functions, they may hence be characterised by analogy. Like NS1 protein of Influenza A virus, s8ORF2 of ISAV is implicated in interferon antagonism and RNA-binding functions. In this study, we investigated the role of s8ORF2 in RNAi suppression in a well-established Agrobacterium transient suppression assay in stably silenced transgenic Nicotiana xanthi. In addition, s8ORF2 was identified as a novel interactor with SsMov10, a key molecule responsible for RISC assembly and maturation in the RNAi pathway. This study thus sheds light on a novel route undertaken by viral proteins in promoting viral growth, using the host RNAi machinery.","Thukral, Vandana; Varshney, Bhavna; Ramly, Rimatulhana B.; Ponia, Sanket S.; Mishra, Sumona Karjee; Olsen, Christel M.; Banerjea, Akhil C.; Mukherjee, Sunil K.; Zaidi, Rana; Rimstad, Espen; Lal, Sunil K.",Virus Genes,221,1

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the pulmonary pathology caused by H9N2 viral infection in mice. Six- to eight-week-old BALB/c mice were infected intranasally with 1 × 10(4) MID(50) of A/Chicken/Hebei/4/2008(H9N2) virus. Clinical signs, pathological changes and viral replication in lungs, arterial blood gas, and cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were observed at different time points after infection. A control group was infected intranasally with noninfectious allantoic fluid. H9N2-infected mice exhibited severe respiratory syndrome, with a mortality rate of 60%. Gross observations showed that infected lungs were highly edematous. Major histopathological changes in infected lungs included diffuse pneumonia and alveolar damage, with neutrophil-dominant inflammatory cellular infiltration, interstitial and alveolar edema, hemorrhage, and severe bronchiolitis/peribronchiolitis. In addition, H9N2 viral infection resulted in severe progressive hypoxemia, lymphopenia, and a significant increase in neutrophils, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 in BALF. The features described above satisfy the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Our data show that H9N2 viral infection resulted in ARDS in mice, and this may facilitate studies of the pathogenesis of future potential H9N2 disease in humans.","Deng, Guangcun; Bi, Jianmin; Kong, Fuli; Li, Xuezhu; Xu, Qiang; Dong, Jun; Zhang, Miaojie; Zhao, Lihong; Luan, Zhihua; Lv, Nana; Qiao, Jian",Arch Virol,221,3

Some plants and probiotic strains could give a better protection to our organism by strengthening the immune system. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this preliminary survey was to evaluate the possible preventive effect against infections of Cupressus sempervirens/Echinacea purpurea combination (plants known for their immune and anti-viral effects) in association with probiotics during the winter season. METHODS: It’s a declarative survey by questionnaire. The objective was to compare the occurrence of winter infections in two populations aged 18–65 years old in good health which used this complementation for at least 3 months period during winter period or not. RESULTS: The rate of incidence of flu (P = 0.012), common cold (P = 0.002) and throat infection (P = 0.0017) decreased in the group that took complementation compared to the group that didn’t take complementation. The occurrence of colds was also significantly reduced in a subgroup of subjects that are more sensitive to infections during winter and took the complementation compared to the same subgroup of subjects that didn’t take the complementation (36 vs 78% of colds, P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The results show that consumption of both products for 3 months or more is associated to a lesser incidence of winter infections such as flu, cold and throat infection. It might be interesting to conduct a larger prospective study to determine the exact role of Lactibiane® and Phytostandard® of Cypressus-Echinacea in the prevention of these winter infections.","Bieuvelet, S.; Seyrig, C.; Leclerc, C.",Phytotherapie (Paris),221,1

There was no statistical relationship between responses and either tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin (IL)-10 promoter polymorphisms among the 3 response groups. When poor and normal responses were combined, the -1082 A allele in the IL-10 promoter conferred a significantly decreased risk of the development of adverse responses (P = .041).

By using the block heterogeneous mean-field approach, a series of discrete-time dynamical models is formulated and the condition for epidemic outbreaks can be established which is shown to be not only dependent on the network structure but also closely related to the immunization control parameters. Results show that increasing the immunization strength can effectively raise the epidemic threshold, which is different from the predictions obtained through the susceptible-infected-susceptible network framework, where epidemic threshold is independent of the vaccination strength. Furthermore, a significant decrease of vaccine use to control the infectious disease is observed for the local vaccination strategy, which shows the promising applications of the local immunization programs to disease control while calls for accurate local information during the process of disease outbreak.","Wu, Qingchu; Lou, Yijun",Chaos,221,1

In particular, individuals can obtain different types of information about the disease and respond by altering their behaviors, and this can affect the spreading dynamics, possibly in a significant way. We propose a model where individuals' behavioral response is based on a generic type of local information, i.e., the number of neighbors that has been infected with the disease. Mathematically, the response can be characterized by a reduction in the transmission rate by a factor that depends on the number of infected neighbors. Utilizing the standard susceptible-infected-susceptible and susceptible-infected-recovery dynamical models for epidemic spreading, we derive a theoretical formula for the epidemic threshold and provide numerical verification. Our analysis lays on a solid quantitative footing the intuition that individual behavioral response can in general suppress epidemic spreading. Furthermore, we find that the hub nodes play the role of “double-edged sword” in that they can either suppress or promote outbreak, depending on their responses to the epidemic, providing additional support for the idea that these nodes are key to controlling epidemic spreading in complex networks.","Zhang, Hai-Feng; Xie, Jia-Rong; Tang, Ming; Lai, Ying-Cheng",Chaos,221,1

Tailed bacteriophages have a common origin and constitute an order with three families, named Caudovirales. Their structured tail is unique. Tailed phages share a series of high-level taxonomic properties and show many facultative features that are unique or rare in viruses—for example, tail appendages and unusual bases. They share with other viruses, especially herpesviruses, elements of morphogenesis and lifestyle that are attributed to convergent evolution. Tailed phages present three types of lysogeny, exemplified by phages λ, Mu, and P1. Lysogeny appears as a secondary property acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Amino acid sequence alignments (notably of DNA polymerases, integrases, and peptidoglycan hydrolases) indicate frequent events of horizontal gene transfer in tailed phages. Common capsid and tail proteins have not been detected. Present-day tailed phages appear as chimeras, but their monophyletic origin is still inscribed in their morphology, genome structure, and replication strategy. It may also be evident in the three-dimensional structure of capsid and tail proteins. It is unlikely to be found in amino acid sequences because constitutive proteins must be so old that relationships were obliterated and most or all replication-, lysogeny-, and lysis-related proteins appear to have been borrowed.","Ackermann, Hans-W.",Adv Virus Res,221,1

FLUAV has long been the cause of annual epidemics as well as less frequent but more severe global pandemics. Here, we describe a biosensor utilizing electrically active magnetic (EAM) polyaniline-coated nanoparticles as the transducer in an electrochemical biosensor for rapidly identifying FLUAV strains based on receptor specificity, which will be useful to monitor animal influenza infections and to characterize pandemic potential of strains that have transmitted from animals to humans. Pandemic potential requires human-to-human transmissibility, which is dependent upon FLUAV hemagglutinin (HA) specificity for host glycan receptors. Avian FLUAV preferentially bind to α2,3-linked receptors, while human FLUAV bind to α2,6-linked receptors. EAM nanoparticles were prepared by synthesizing aniline monomer around gamma iron (III) oxide (γ-Fe(2)O(3)) cores, yielding 25–100-nm diameter nanoparticles that were structurally characterized by transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction. The EAM nanoparticles were coated with monoclonal antibodies specific to H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/04). Specificity of binding between glycans and H5 was demonstrated. The biosensor results were correlative to supporting data from a surface plasmon resonance assay that characterized HA/glycan binding and α-H5 antibody activity.

Recently, it has become clear that a wide variety of lipids and glycolipids are also targets of the T cell response. This novel form of cell‐mediated immune recognition is mediated by a family of lipid binding and presenting molecules known as CD1. The CD1 proteins represent a small to moderate sized family of β2‐microglobulin‐associated transmembrane proteins that are distantly related to MHC class I and class II molecules. They are conserved in most or all mammals, and control the development and function of T cell populations that participate in innate and adaptive immune responses through the recognition of self and foreign lipid antigens. Here we review the current state of our understanding of the structure and function of CD1 proteins, and the role of CD1‐restricted T cell responses in the immune system.","Dutronc, Y.; Porcelli, S.A.",Tissue Antigens,221,1

We conducted a systematic review to determine whether tracheostomy modifications alter swallowing physiology in adults. We searched eight electronic databases, nine grey literature repositories and conducted handsearching. We included studies that reported on oropharyngeal dysphagia as identified by instrumentation in adults with a tracheostomy. We accepted case series (n > 10), prospective or retrospective observational studies, and randomized control trials. We excluded patients with head and neck cancer and/or neurodegenerative disease.

All models have the same epidemic thresholds in mean-field theories but depending on the network properties, simulations yield a dual scenario, in which the epidemic thresholds of the modified SIS models can be either dramatically altered or remain unchanged in comparison with the standard dynamics. For uncorrelated synthetic networks having a power-law degree distribution with exponent [Formula: see text] , the SIS dynamics are robust exhibiting essentially the same outcomes for all investigated models. A threshold in better agreement with the heterogeneous rather than quenched mean-field theory is observed in the modified dynamics for exponent [Formula: see text]. Differences are more remarkable for [Formula: see text] , where a finite threshold is found in the modified models in contrast with the vanishing threshold of the original one. This duality is elucidated in terms of epidemic lifespan on star graphs. We verify that the activation of the modified SIS models is triggered in the innermost component of the network given by a [Formula: see text]-core decomposition for [Formula: see text] while it happens only for [Formula: see text] in the standard model. For [Formula: see text] , the activation in the modified dynamics is collective involving essentially the whole network while it is triggered by hubs in the standard SIS. The duality also appears in the finite-size scaling of the critical quantities where mean-field behaviors are observed for the modified but not for the original dynamics.

DESIGN: A task force involving 13 international experts and three methodologists used the GRADE approach for guideline development. METHODS: The task force identified four main topics: red blood cell transfusion thresholds, red blood cell transfusion avoidance strategies, platelet transfusion, and plasma transfusion. The panel developed structured guideline questions using population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) format. RESULTS: The task force generated 16 clinical practice recommendations (3 strong recommendations, 13 conditional recommendations), and identified five PICOs with insufficient evidence to make any recommendation.

However, the risk factors for PH are controversial. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the perinatal risk factors and short-term outcomes of PH in ELBWIs. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of live born infants who had birth weights that were less than 1000 g, lived for at least 12 hours, and did not have major congenital anomalies. A logistic regression model was established to analyze the risk factors associated with PH. RESULTS: There were 168 ELBWIs born during this period. A total of 160 infants were included, and 30 infants were diagnosed with PH. Risk factors including gestational age, small for gestational age, intubation in the delivery room, surfactant in the delivery room, repeated use of surfactant, higher FiO(2) during the first day, invasive ventilation during the first day and early onset sepsis (EOS) were associated with the occurrence of PH by univariate analysis. In the logistic regression model, EOS was found to be an independent risk factor for PH. The mortality and intraventricular hemorrhage rate of the group of ELBWIs with PH were significantly higher than those of the group of ELBWIs without PH. The rates of periventricular leukomalacia, moderate-to-severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and severe retinopathy of prematurity, and the duration of the hospital stay were not significantly different between the PH and no-PH groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although PH did not extend hospital stay or increase the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, it increased the mortality and intraventricular hemorrhage rate in ELBWIs. EOS was the independent risk factor for PH in ELBWIs.","Wang, Ting-Ting; Zhou, Ming; Hu, Xue-Feng; Liu, Jiang-Qin",World J Pediatr,221,1

Patients suffer from impaired organ function, reduced physical functional capacity and decreased quality of life even after surviving sepsis. The identification of prognostic factors for the medium-term and long-term outcomes of this condition is necessary to develop personalised theragnostic approaches. Sepsis can cause cardiac impairment. The impact of this septic cardiomyopathy on patient’s long-term outcome remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate cardiovascular risk factors, particularly the occurrence of septic cardiomyopathy, regarding their suitability as prognostic factors for the short-term and long-term outcomes of septic patients. Additionally, the study seeks to validate preclinical pathophysiological findings of septic cardiomyopathy in the clinical setting. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this prospective monocentric cohort study, patients will be clinically assessed during the acute and postacute phase of sepsis and two follow-ups after 6 and 12 months. To determine the effect of septic cardiomyopathy and concomitant cellular and molecular changes on patient mortality and morbidity, a comprehensive cardiovascular and molecular deep phenotyping of patients will be performed. This includes an echocardiographic and electrocardiographic assessment, and the evaluation of heart rate variability, body composition, mitochondrial oxygen metabolism, macrocirculation and microcirculation, and endothelial barrier function. These analyses are complemented by routine immunological, haematological and biochemical laboratory tests and analyses of the serum metabolome and lipidome, microbiome and epigenetic modifications of immune cells. The reversibility of patients’ organ dysfunction, their quality of life and physical functional capacity will be investigated in the follow-ups. Patients with cardiomyopathy without infection and healthy subjects will serve as control groups. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Friedrich Schiller University Jena (5276-09/17). The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at appropriate conferences.

These vesicles encompass many bio-molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids that are transported between cells and regulate pathophysiological actions in the recipient cell. Exosomes originate from multivesicular bodies inside cells and microvesicles shed from the plasma membrane and participate in various pathological conditions. Retroviruses such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus -type 1 (HIV-1) and Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-1 engage exosomes for spreading and infection. Exosomes from virus-infected cells transfer viral components such as miRNAs and proteins that promote infection and inflammation. Additionally, these exosomes deliver virus receptors to target cells that make them susceptible to virus entry. HIV-1 infected cells release exosomes that contribute to the pathogenesis including neurological disorders and malignancy. Exosomes can also potentially carry out as a modern approach for the development of HIV-1 and HTLV-1 vaccines. Furthermore, as exosomes are present in most biological fluids, they hold the supreme capacity for clinical usage in the early diagnosis and prognosis of viral infection and associated diseases. Our current knowledge of exosomes' role from virus-infected cells may provide an avenue for efficient retroviruses associated with disease prevention. However, the exact mechanism involved in retroviruses infection/ inflammation remains elusive and related exosomes research will shed light on the mechanisms of pathogenesis.","Rezaie, Jafar; Aslan, Cynthia; Ahmadi, Mahdi; Zolbanin, Naime Majidi; Kashanchi, Fatah; Jafari, Reza",Cell Biosci,221,1

In this regard, high-throughput gene transcriptional profiling has become a leading technology, generating whole-genome data on the transcriptional alterations caused by diseases or drug compounds. However, identifying direct gene targets, especially in the background of indirect (downstream) effects, based on differential gene expressions is difficult due to the complexity of gene regulatory network governing the gene transcriptional processes. RESULTS: In this work, we developed a network analysis method, called DeltaNeTS+, for inferring direct gene targets of drugs and diseases from gene transcriptional profiles. DeltaNeTS+ uses a gene regulatory network model to identify direct perturbations to the transcription of genes using gene expression data. Importantly, DeltaNeTS+ is able to combine both steady-state and time-course expression profiles, as well as leverage information on the gene network structure. We demonstrated the power of DeltaNeTS+ in predicting gene targets using gene expression data in complex organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans and human cell lines (T-cell and Calu-3). More specifically, in an application to time-course gene expression profiles of influenza A H1N1 (swine flu) and H5N1 (avian flu) infection, DeltaNeTS+ shed light on the key differences of dynamic cellular perturbations caused by the two influenza strains. CONCLUSION: DeltaNeTS+ is a powerful network analysis tool for inferring gene targets from gene expression profiles. As demonstrated in the case studies, by incorporating available information on gene network structure, DeltaNeTS+ produces accurate predictions of direct gene targets from a small sample size (~ 10 s). Integrating static and dynamic expression data with transcriptional network structure extracted from genomic information, as enabled by DeltaNeTS+, is crucial toward personalized medicine, where treatments can be tailored to individual patients.

Aztreonam, a relatively high-cost antipseudomonal antibiotic, is an appropriate target for stewardship initiatives based on propensity for overuse in penicillin allergy, an activity profile often warranting additional empiric gram-negative and gram-positive coverage, and a unique durability to Ambler class B metallo-beta-lactamases. Objective Analyze the immediate and long-term impact on aztreonam prescribing of combining restrictive and enabling interventions. Setting Single 233-bed community hospital with 45 adult intensive care unit beds in Nashville, Tennessee. Method Retrospective, interrupted time series analysis comparing all patients receiving aztreonam prior to intervention between January 1, 2010 and September 30, 2011 and following intervention between October 1, 2011 and September 30, 2019. Quarterly defined daily doses/1000 adjusted patient days and microbiology laboratory annual surveillance data were utilized for analysis. Main outcome measure Post-intervention change in trend of aztreonam consumption. Results Following intervention, a significant decline in aztreonam consumption was observed (− 1.97 defined daily doses/1000 adjusted patient days; p = 0.003) resulting in a sustained decrease in aztreonam consumption from 2011 (3rd quarter) to 2019 (3rd quarter) from 15.2 to 0.26 defined daily doses/1000 adjusted patient days. Short-term group 2 carbapenem consumption increased (p = 0.044). Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptibility to aztreonam improved from 2011 to 2018 (72% vs. 84%; p = 0.0004) without deleterious effects to alternative antipseudomonal beta-lactams.

The aim of this study was to examine the resistance rates of less frequent uropathogenic Gram-negatives in a population of patients treated in a Department of Urology of a tertiary referral centre in Central Europe over a period of 9 years. METHODS: Data on all positive urine samples from urological in- and out-patients were extracted form the Department of Clinical Microbiology database from 2011 to 2019. Numbers of susceptible and resistant isolates per year were calculated for these uropathogens: Acinetobacter spp. (n = 74), Citrobacter spp. (n = 60), Enterobacter spp. (n = 250), Morganella morganii (n = 194), Providencia spp. (n = 53), Serratia spp. (n = 82) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 27). Antimicrobial agents selected for the survey included: ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam; cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefepime; ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin; gentamicin and amikacin; ertapenem, meropenem and imipenem; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole), nitrofurantoin and colistin. RESULTS: Penicillin derivatives have generally poor effect except piperacillin/tazobactam. Cefuroxime is not efficient unlike cefotaxime (except against Acinetobacter spp. and S. maltophilia). Susceptibility to fluoroquinolones is limited. Amikacin is somewhat more efficient than gentamicine but susceptibilities for both safely exceed 80%. Nitrofurantoin shows virtually no efficiency. Cotrimoxazole acts well against Citrobacter spp., Serratia spp. and it is the treatment of choice for S. maltophilia UTIs. Among carbapenems, ertapenem was less efficient than meropenem and imipenem except for S. maltophilia whose isolates were mostly not suceptible to any carbapenems. CONCLUSIONS: Uropathogenic microorganisms covered in this report are noteworthy for their frequently multi-drug resistant phenotypes. Knowledge of resistance patterns helps clinicians choose the right empirical antibiotic treatment when the taxonomical assignment of the isolate is known but sensitivity results are pending.

Studies demonstrated that curcumin could exert anti-tumor activity via multiple biological signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt, JAK/STAT, MAPK, Wnt/β-catenin, p53, NF-ĸB and apoptosis related signaling pathways. Moreover, Curcumin can inhibit tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion and metastasis by regulating tumor related non-coding RNA (ncRNA) expression. In this review, we summarized the roles of curcumin in regulating signaling pathways and ncRNAs in different kinds of cancers. We also discussed the regulatory effect of curcumin through inhibiting carcinogenic miRNA and up regulating tumor suppressive miRNA. Furthermore, we aim to illustrate the cross regulatory relationship between ncRNA and signaling pathways, further to get a better understanding of the anti-tumor mechanism of curcumin, thus lay a theoretical foundation for the clinical application of curcumin in the future.","Wang, Haijun; Zhang, Ke; Liu, Jia; Yang, Jie; Tian, Yidan; Yang, Chen; Li, Yushan; Shao, Minglong; Su, Wei; Song, Na",Front Oncol,221,1

In this report, a special case of cervicothoracic injury caused by foreign body penetration was elucidated. In this case, the injury location and the involved foreign body were exceptionally particular, which induced a challenging process of diagnosis and treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A male patient suffered from a serious injury caused by a thick branch that pierced through his neck in a traffic accident between an electric car and a tricycle carrying wood. There were also local injuries in the left scapular region. After an emergency multidisciplinary consultation, the patient was diagnosed and subsequently treated with vascular exploration and repair (common carotid artery), intrathoracic foreign body extraction, chest exploration, debridement, and suture. After surgery, he was transferred to the emergency intensive care unit for anticoagulation and anti-infection treatment. Finally, after the improvement of his physical condition, the patient was transferred to the general ward for further treatment and was successfully discharged from the hospital. Once discharged, the patient lived a normal life, free from sequelae or complications. CONCLUSION: It may be an extremely daunting task to cure cervicothoracic penetrating injury due to its rare occurrence in clinical practice. Different from the previous cervicothoracic traumas, the injury location in this case is exceedingly particular. In general, the common cervicothoracic trauma is associated with damage to the trachea, esophagus, throat, and other structures, easily resulting in dyspnea, which, however, does not occur in this case. The insertion position of foreign body is exceptionally particular as it does not pierce the common carotid artery but poses compression on it, which induces ischemia. It is essential for the successful treatment that the treatment plan is formulated via the detailed imaging examination and careful multidisciplinary consultation.","Hui, Yang; Yang, Xinxin; Ma, Dengdian; Yao, Mengwei; Liu, Xinying; Dai, Yunbing; Huang, Qinyuan; Liu, Tao; Xu, Jing; Li, Xiaoyu",BMC Surg,221,8

METHODS: In order to realize proposed framework, a dataset containing Motor Imaginary and Mental Activity tasks are prepared with Electroencephalography (EEG) and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) signal. First of all, HbO and HbR curves are obtained from NIRS signals. Hbo, HbR, HbO+HbR, EEG, EEG+HbO and EEG+HbR features tables are created with the features obtained by using HbO, HbR, and EEG signals, and feature weighted is carried out with the k-Means clustering centers based attribute weighting method (KMCC-based) and the k-Means clustering centers difference based attribute weighting method (KMCCD-based). Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (kNN) classifiers are used to see the classifier differences in the study. RESULTS: As a result of this study, an accuracy rate of 99.7% (with kNN classifier and KMCCD-based weighting) is obtained in the data set of Motor Imaginary. Similarly, an accuracy rate of 99.9% (with SVM and kNN classifier and KMCCD-based weighting) is obtained in the Mental Activity dataset. The weighting method is used to increase the classification accuracy, and it has been shown that it will contribute to the classification of EEG and NIRS BCI systems. The results show that the proposed method increases classifiers’ performance, offering less processing power and ease of application. In the future, studies could be carried out by combining the k-Means clustering center-based weighted hybrid BCI method with deep learning architectures. Further improved classifier performances can be achieved by combining both systems.","Alhudhaif, Adi",PeerJ Comput Sci,221,1

They particularly cause frequent morbidity among children. In China, human adenovirus types 3, 4, 7, 11, 14, 21, and 55 have caused at least seven outbreaks since 2000. However, limited studies are available regarding the epidemiological patterns and diversity of HAdVs types among hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections (RTIs). METHODS: To understand the epidemiology and subtype distribution of HAdV infections associated with RTIs in China, nasal swab (NS) clinical samples were collected from 4129 patients in a Guangzhou hospital between August 2017 and October 2019. PCR, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis were performed on these specimens to identify HAdV subtypes. RESULTS: HAdV was successfully sequenced in 99 (2.4%) of the 4129 NS specimens, with the highest HAdV prevalence (6.3%) found in children between the ages of 5 and 10 years. Among HAdV-positive specimens, the most prevalent genotypes identified were HAdV-B3 (55.6%) and HAdV-B7 (25.3%). The most common symptoms in the HAdV-infected patients were fever (100%), cough (80.8%), and rhinorrhea (71.8%). HAdV infections were detected throughout the year with a relatively higher prevalence in summer. CONCLUSION: All ages suffer adenovirus infections, but young children are at the greatest risk. This study data demonstrates that at least three species of HAdVs (species B, C, and E) are circulating in Guangzhou City, China. As antiviral therapies and type-specific vaccines become available, such epidemiological data will be useful in guiding therapy and public health interventions.

This study aimed to identify, collate and review the available evidence to identify specific countries where UK travellers might be at an increased risk of developing pneumococcal infection. The data were then used to develop an algorithm, which could be used to facilitate implementation of the JCVI recommendation. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the published data available for pneumococcal disease, PCV vaccine implementation, coverage data and programme duration by country. The primary data sources used were World Health Organization databases and the International Vaccine Access Centre Vaccine Information and Epidemiology Window-hub database. Based on the algorithm, the countries were classified into ‘high overall risk’, ‘intermediate overall risk’ and ‘low overall risk’ from an adult traveller perspective. This could determine whether PCV13 should be recommended for UK adult travellers. RESULTS: A data search for a total of 228 countries was performed, with risk scores calculated for 188 countries. Overall, 45 countries were classified as ‘high overall risk’, 86 countries as ‘intermediate overall risk’, 57 countries as ‘low overall risk’ and 40 countries as ‘unknown’. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge this is the first attempt to categorize the risk to UK adult travellers of contracting pneumococcal infection in each country, globally. These findings could be used by national travel advisory bodies and providers of travel vaccines to identify travellers at increased risk of pneumococcal infection, who could be offered PCV immunization.","Ellsbury, Gillian; Campling, James; Madhava, Harish; Slack, Mary",J Travel Med,221,1

Histopathological examination of the temporal artery biopsy reveals focal thickening of the intima, with interruption of the lamina propria, with transmural inflammatory infiltrates, sometimes with multinucleated giant cells. In this article, we aim to review the role of temporal artery resection in the diagnosis of Horton's arteritis, but we also discuss the hypothesis of a potential therapeutic benefit of this procedure. However, there are also clinical situations in which there has been a considerable improvement in clinical symptoms and especially in vision deficit, with the improvement of the visual field after surgery performed for biopsy. It is difficult to estimate the influence of temporal artery resection alone, given that most patients also have concomitant cortisone treatment. However, in some cases, the rapid improvement of symptoms immediately after surgery, with the improvement of visual acuity and visual field, along with the disappearance of the headaches, can create the premises for future studies on a therapeutic contribution of temporal artery resection in GCA.","Vrinceanu, Daniela; Dumitru, Mihai; Banica, Bogdan; Eftime, Ioana-Silvia; Patrascu, Oana; Costache, Adrian; Cherecheanu, Matei Popa; Georgescu, Madalina Gabriela",Exp Ther Med,221,19

The endophytes represent a potential source of novel natural and ecofriendly products for medicinal, agricultural and industrial uses with least adverse effect on the environment. The enormous biological diversity coupled with their capability to biosynthesize bioactive secondary metabolites has provided the momentum for the researchers working on endophytes. The present review was undertaken to highlight the biotechnological processes and bioprospection of endophytes as potential antimicrobial agents, secondary metabolites, antibiotics, antagonists against disease causing phytopathogens, cytotoxic, anticancer, insecticidal, antioxidant antiviral compounds andisolation and production of bioactive compounds with potent enzymatic activities. Endophyte enhances biodegradation and hydrolysis processes significantly important against pathogenic infection, biotransformation studies and production of compounds with immense industrial applications. The interaction of the endophytic microbiota with the plants are more protected and can withstand the adverse environmental conditions and contribute to plant growth, productivity, carbon sequestration, enhanced phytoremediation efficiencies and amelioration of metal induced toxicity. The strategies governed by the endophytes for efficient production of novel bioactive phytocompounds was comprehensively discussed.

In the last decade, new technological advances in microarrays and sequencing strategies enabled more sophisticated methods for detecting viruses in clinical and environmental specimens. These methods led to the discovery of many novel viruses from a variety of virus families. They also brought about a dramatic realization that more astroviruses can be found in humans than previously recognized. In fact, the number of astroviruses associated with humans has nearly doubled within the last few years. Furthermore, the discovery of novel astroviruses in human specimens revealed that there is more diversity amongst them than was assumed based on the high level of similarity between human astroviruses 1 and 8.

This period saw a previously unknown TSE emerge in cattle and then transmit to humans, a scenario which by August 2009 had cost 164 people their lives in the UK and which has resulted in an unknown number of other people incubating variant CJD (vCJD). The economic damage caused by this disease has been considerable. In April 2000, the government estimated that by the end of the 2001/2002 financial year, the total net cost of the BSE crisis to the Exchequer would be £3.7 billion (BSE Inquiry Report, Volume 10: 1). Less quantifiable consequences have also stemmed from this crisis. Chief amongst them has been significant damage to the public’s ability to trust the pronouncements of government on matters of food safety and risk. The scientific community has suffered inestimable damage to its expertise and to its capacity to provide objective, consistent scientific advice to the public. With such serious consequences emanating from the BSE affair, it is incumbent on all those who were involved in this tragic episode to reflect on the events that took place and to consider how things could have been done better. Such a reflective exercise has, of course, been conducted by Lord Phillips and his inquiry team who examined all the events that took place during the BSE epidemic and drew a wide-ranging set of lessons from these events. A reflective purpose is also a central motivation of the current chapter. However, the focus of this reflection – scientific reasoning in contexts of uncertainty – is altogether narrower than that undertaken during the public inquiry into BSE. Moreover, the question of reasoning in contexts of uncertainty was omitted from Lord Phillips’ inquiry into BSE and has also been overlooked within the vast literature that has been written on the topic of BSE both before and after this inquiry was conducted.","Cummings, Louise",Rethinking the BSE Crisis,221,1

Aiming for infectious disease containment within the very early stage of spreading, we computed the minimum transmissibility at which an infectious disease epidemic begins to emerge, and its change according to mass preventive and ring post-outbreak vaccination. In the most degree-heterogeneous scale-free network, the ‘super-spreading’ by the hubs, or high-degree nodes, allowed epidemics even for low transmissibility. In compensation, vaccination was much more efficient for the scale-free network.

There is no quick fix for enteric virus contamination of shellfish; however, vigilance on behalf of the industry, regulatory agencies, and the consumer could substantially reduce the incidence of illness. Enhanced monitoring in all areas of shellfish production, harvesting, distribution, and processing would help to reduce viral illnesses.

Expression of a gene, nuclear, or organellar starts with the onset of transcription and ends in the synthesis of the functional protein. The regulation of gene expression is a complex process that requires the coordinated activity of different proteins and nucleic acids that ultimately determine whether a gene is transcribed, and if transcribed, whether it results in the production of a protein that develops a phenotype. The same also holds true for transgenic crops, which lie at the very core of insert design. There are multiple checkpoints at which the expression of a gene can be regulated and controlled. Much of the emphasis of studies related to gene expression has been on regulation of gene transcription, and a number of methods are used to effect the control of gene expression. Controlling transgene expression for a commercially valuable trait is necessary to capture its value. Many gene functions are either lethal or produce severe deformity (resulting in loss of value) if over-expressed. Thus, expression of a transgene at a particular site or in response to a particular elicitor is always desirable.","Bandopadhyay, Rajib; Haque, Inamul; Singh, Dharmendra; Mukhopadhyay, Kunal",Transgenic Crop Plants,221,1

Medicines manufactured in the modern era are associated with major controversies such as non–target specificity, resistance, repeated administration, immune rejection, and other adverse effects on the body. Thus, there is a great need to find drugs that do not raise the aforementioned issues. Nature is an excellent hub providing a diverse range of phytoconstituents that open the way to phototherapeutics, which need a scientific path to deliver the active elements in a supported way to increase patient compliance and reduce the need for repeated administration. To discover a novel phytochemical as a lead compound for a therapeutic purpose is a real challenge. In former times, drug discovery was a complex process, as it took several years to find a lead compound for use against a particular disease. Nowadays, however, virtual screening methods have been developed, which are target specific, time consuming, and cost effective. To avoid increased and repeated administration of a drug, nanosized drug delivery systems for herbal drugs have been developed to enhance the activity and overcome problems associated with synthetic medicines.

Nowadays, nanobased drug delivery systems are in demand for delivery of herbal medicines used for therapeutic purposes.

Bioethics investigates research in healthcare and medicine, examining public policy as it relates to healthcare and how resources are allocated. This includes: difficult, private, individual decisions, which occur in clinical settings; dilemmas during clinical trials; and controversies surrounding novel research. It is important to understand that ethical considerations related to health care ethics and those that pertain to public health are often seen from different perspectives. In public health, decisions are made within a context and a framework through principles which guide action that affect communities and populations. These decisions and actions are made with and involve, stakeholders to include: traditional, community and religious leaders; government officials; and private and commercial stake holders. The underlying principles of both public health ethics and bioethics are the same, namely equality, justice, beneficence, non-maleficence, veracity and fidelity. Health care ethics supports the rights of individuals. Under the same umbrella of health care ethics are medical ethics, clinical ethics and research ethics. These disciplines offer views that support the rights of individuals. Ethics in public health is very complex with a myriad of issues to include diverse groups of people in different situations, which have to be taken into account from the view of what is best for the population.

In this work, we devise a new task of QAC applied on an image for estimating patch (one of the key components of Information Foraging Theory) probabilities for query suggestion. Our work supports query completion by extending a user query prefix (one or two characters) to a complete query utilising a foraging-based probabilistic patch selection model. We present iBERT, to fine-tune the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, which leverages combined textual-image queries for a solution to image QAC by computing probabilities of a large set of image patches. The reflected patch probabilities are used for selection while being agnostic to changing information need or contextual mechanisms. Experimental results show that query auto-completion using both natural language queries and images is more effective than using only language-level queries. Also, our fine-tuned iBERT model allows to efficiently rank patches in the image.","Jaiswal, Amit Kumar; Liu, Haiming; Frommholz, Ingo",Advances in Information Retrieval,221,1

A complex technology is developed to support the assessment of adverse effects of inhaled substances in rodent and nonrodent species, and the extrapolation of experimental findings to humans. The nasal chambers are the structures that are first to be subjected to the effects of inhaled substances, whether microorganisms or chemical substances. In rodents, the relatively small size of the nose and nasal sinuses facilitates a histological examination. Findings show that infectious agents cause inflammation in the nose and nasal sinuses, and this may be associated with inflammation in the conjunctiva, the middle ear, and the oral cavity. It has been observed that a particular response of the rodent nasal mucosa to some irritant substances, including pharmaceutical agents, is the formation of rounded eosinophilic inclusions in the cytoplasm of sustentacular cells of the olfactory epithelium, and to a lesser extent in respiratory and glandular epithelial cells.","Greaves, Peter",Histopathology of Preclinical Toxicity Studies,221,1

In this paper we propose a novel tree data structure, SP-Tree, to store the sequence database in a new and efficient manner. Additionally, we propose a new mining algorithm Tree-miner to mine sequential patterns from SP-Tree. To further enhance the performance of our algorithm, we incorporate multiple pruning techniques and optimizations. As our SP-Tree stores the complete database, it can also be used for incremental and dynamic databases, tree-structure is particularly advantageous for interactive mining. We demonstrate how our SP-Tree based Tree-miner algorithm significantly outperforms all of the existing state-of-the-art algorithms, across 6 real life datasets. We conclude by discussing the possible extensions of our approach to other related fields of sequential data.","Rizvee, Redwan Ahmed; Arefin, Mohammad Fahim; Ahmed, Chowdhury Farhan",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,221,1

Existing global centrality measures suffer from the high computational complexity and unrealistic assumptions, limiting their applications on real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a new centrality measure, Node Conductance, to effectively detect spanning structural hole nodes and predict the formation of new edges. Node Conductance is the sum of the probability that node i is revisited at r-th step, where r is an integer between 1 and infinity. Moreover, with the help of node embedding techniques, Node Conductance is able to be approximately calculated on big networks effectively and efficiently. Thorough experiments present the differences between existing centralities and Node Conductance, its outstanding ability of detecting influential nodes on both static and dynamic network, and its superior efficiency compared with other global centralities.

With graphs growing in size, node classification on large graphs can be space and time consuming, even with powerful classifiers such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Hence, some questions are raised, particularly, whether one can keep only some of the edges of a graph while maintaining prediction performance for node classification, or train classifiers on specific subgraphs instead of a whole graph with limited performance loss in node classification. To address these questions, we propose Sparsified Graph Convolutional Network (SGCN), a neural network graph sparsifier that sparsifies a graph by pruning some edges. We formulate sparsification as an optimization problem, which we solve by an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based solution. We show that sparsified graphs provided by SGCN can be used as inputs to GCN, leading to better or comparable node classification performance with that of original graphs in GCN, DeepWalk, and GraphSAGE.","Li, Jiayu; Zhang, Tianyun; Tian, Hao; Jin, Shengmin; Fardad, Makan; Zafarani, Reza",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,221,1

Due to inherent sparsity in high-dimensional data, distances between objects tend to become meaningless since the distances between any two objects measured in the full dimensional space tend to become the same for all pairs of objects. In this work, we present a novel oriented subspace clustering algorithm that is able to deal with such issues and detects arbitrarily oriented subspace clusters in high-dimensional data streams. Data streams generally implicate the challenge that the data cannot be stored entirely and hence there is a general demand for suitable data handling strategies for clustering algorithms such that the data can be processed within a single scan. We therefore propose the CashStream algorithm that unites state-of-the-art stream processing techniques and additionally relies on the Hough transform to detect arbitrarily oriented subspace clusters. Our experiments compare CashStream to its static counterpart and show that the amount of consumed memory is significantly decreased while there is no loss in terms of runtime.

The results are compared to our initial assumptions over each backend’s performance in these subsets based on personal experiences.

Logic-based frameworks like LARS allow the execution of complex reasoning on such streams, but it is paramount that the computation is completed in a timely manner before the stream expires. To reduce the runtime, we can extend the validity of inferred conclusions to the future to avoid repeated derivations, but this is not enough to avoid all sources of redundant computation. To further alleviate this problem, this paper introduces a new technique that infers the impossibility of certain derivations in the future and blocks the reasoner from performing computation that is doomed to fail anyway.

In this paper, we present a methodology of generating knowledge graphs addressing such a need. We call them World-perceiving Knowledge Graphs – WpKG. The process of their construction is based on analyzing images. We apply deep learning image processing methods to extract scene graphs.

In this paper we show that the number of samples the CSNN needs to converge can be reduced significantly by a proposed new weight initialization. The proposed method uses input samples as initial values for the connection weights. Surprisingly, this simple initialization reduces the number of training samples needed for convergence by an order of magnitude without loss of accuracy.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship among personality dimensions, spirituality, coping strategies and clinical clerkship satisfaction among intern nursing students. METHODS: This was a correlational, cross-sectional study. A total of 293 Iranian nursing students, who were fulfilling their clinical clerkship at university-affiliated hospitals in Tehran, were selected using cluster random sampling. All participants were provided with standard questionnaires including personality dimensions (NEO_FFI), spirituality, coping strategies (WoCQ), and satisfaction with clinical clerkship. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlation and hierarchical multiple regression. RESULTS: The results showed that spirituality (β = 0.32, p < 0.001), problem-focused coping (β = 0.26, p < 0.001) and extraversion (of personality dimensions, β = 0.22, p < 0.001) played significant roles in predicting clinical clerkship satisfaction among intern nursing students. Regression analysis showed openness (β = 0.14, p < 0.01), extraversion (β = 0.16, p < 0.01), and spirituality (β = 0.23, p < 0.001) could significantly predict problem-focused coping style among intern nursing students. However, personality dimensions and spirituality were not good predictors for emotion-focused coping among these students (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Personality dimensions, coping strategies and, in particular, spirituality are good predictors of clinical clerkship satisfaction among intern nursing students. Therefore, paying attention to spiritual needs in nursing students, improving their problem solving skills in dealing with clinical stress and training extraversion characteristics can be effective in enhancing their satisfaction with clinical clerkship.","Rezapour-Mirsaleh, Yasser; Aghabagheri, Mahdi",BMC Nurs,221,1

These issues resonate particularly as researchers grapple with imagining a post-COVID-19 landscape where social and educational norms may change. Tyack and Tobin, in their 1994 article ‘The “Grammar” of Schooling: Why has it been so hard to change?’ argued that several features of the American education system are so persistent as to warrant being understood as the ‘grammar’ of schooling. In this article, we reconceptualize this ‘grammar’ by taking seriously Tyack and Tobin’s insistence that ‘grammar’ organises meaning. Starting here, we argue that what they took to be grammatical features are the products and not the producers of meaning. We draw on the cases of the United States and England to argue that four international discourses have performed this meaning-making work: industrialization; welfarism; neoliberalism and neoconservatism. These are the ‘grammars’ of schooling—and of society. Their discursive products, including age grading and sorting into subjects are, we suggest, ‘lexical’ features that express the grammar. We use lexical features to explain the multi-directional interplay between discourse and educational feature: the lexical may endure longer than the grammatical, changes to which may be effected and/or legitimated through appealing to a lexical feature. We conclude by outlining key implications for realizing and conceptualizing educational change, including for a post-COVID-19 landscape.","Courtney, Steven J.; Mann, Bryan",J Educ Change,221,1

Although many lower- and middle-income settings lack infrastructure for optimal disease surveillance, health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSS) provide a unique opportunity for epidemic monitoring. This protocol describes a surveillance program at the Africa Health Research Institute’s Population Intervention Platform site in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The program leverages a longstanding HDSS in a rural, resource-limited setting with very high prevalence of HIV and tuberculosis to perform Covid-19 surveillance. Our primary aims include: describing the epidemiology of the Covid-19 epidemic in rural KwaZulu-Natal; determining the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and non-pharmaceutical control interventions (NPI) on behaviour and wellbeing; determining the impact of HIV and tuberculosis on Covid-19 susceptibility; and using collected data to support the local public-sector health response. The program involves telephone-based interviews with over 20,000 households every four months, plus a sub-study calling 750 households every two weeks. Each call asks a household representative how the epidemic and NPI are affecting the household and conducts a Covid-19 risk screen for all resident members. Any individuals screening positive are invited to a clinical screen, potential test and referral to necessary care – conducted in-person near their home following careful risk minimization procedures. In this protocol we report the details of our cohort design, questionnaires, data and reporting structures, and standard operating procedures in hopes that our project can inform similar efforts elsewhere.","Siedner, Mark J.; Harling, Guy; Derache, Anne; Smit, Theresa; Khoza, Thandeka; Gunda, Resign; Mngomezulu, Thobeka; Gareta, Dickman; Majozi, Nomathamsanqa; Ehlers, Eugene; Dreyer, Jaco; Nxumalo, Siyabonga; Dayi, Njabulo; Ording-Jesperson, Gregory; Ngwenya, Nothando; Wong, Emily; Iwuji, Collins; Shahmanesh, Maryam; Seeley, Janet; De Oliveira, Tulio; Ndung'u, Thumbi; Hanekom, Willem; Herbst, Kobus",Wellcome Open Res,221,1

The Interpersonal Mindfulness Program (IMP) is a relatively new MBP, developed to teach those with prior mindfulness training to deepen their mindful presence, empathy and compassion in the interpersonal domain. The aim of the present study was to examine the feasibility of using the IMP with mental health care workers and assessing its effects on levels of mindfulness, self-compassion, empathy, stress and professional quality of life when compared with the control group participants. METHODS: The IMP training consisted of nine weekly 2.5-h sessions and daily home practice (45–60 min). Twenty-five participants (mean age, 51.4 years) with mindfulness experience participated in the training. Twenty-two individuals in the control group (mean age, 47.5 years) were recruited from those who had followed a mindfulness training before. Feasibility of the IMP was assessed in the training participants in six domains. All study participants completed self-report questionnaires before and after the training. RESULTS: The IMP training was considered highly acceptable and very useful. The training had a significant positive effect on self-compassion, empathy and compassion fatigue, but no effect on mindfulness, stress and compassion satisfaction. Five participants reported some mild adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: The IMP training appears feasible for health care professionals and seems to induce some positive effects. A few mild adverse effects were reported. Further research on the effectiveness and possible mechanisms of change of the IMP training in larger samples is needed.","Bartels-Velthuis, Agna A.; van den Brink, Erik; Koster, Frits; Hoenders, H.

Perinatal determinants conceivably modify the epigenetic makeup of the developing fetal immune system preventing or predisposing the development of allergies. The aim of this study therefore was to identify independent perinatal factors associated with allergic sensitization in childhood. METHODS: In a single center retrospective case-cohort study electronic obstetric medical records and available skin prick testing results of children were analyzed. For the analysis 286 skin prick test positive (sensitized) children [median (IQR): 3.47 (1.70–7.34) years] were compared with data from all remaining live births in the obstetric cohort (n = 66,583). RESULTS: Sensitized children more frequently had a mother born in Asia (19.1% vs. 10.2%; P < 10–6). Applying backward elimination logistic regression, seven out of 23 initially entered perinatal factors remained in the model. High maternal age (> 35 years; OR: 1.912; P < 0.001), male offspring sex (OR: 1.423; P < 0.01) and assisted conception (OR: 1.771; P < 0.05) increased the risk for allergic sensitization. In contrast, maternal smoking (OR: 0.469; P < 0.005), increasing parity (OR: 0.881; P < 0.05), maternal pre-pregnancy overweight (OR: 0.742; P < 0.005) and preterm birth (OR: 0.484; P < 0.05) decreased the risk for allergic sensitization. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to supporting previous findings, this study is first to report an increased risk of allergic sensitization after assisted conception. Beyond this finding’s potential implementation in preventative strategies, exploration of this association could further pathophysiological understanding of allergic disease.","Schäfer, Samuel; Liu, Anthony; Campbell, Dianne; Nanan, Ralph",Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol,221,1

The outcome can be explained by the patients’ immunity status and late diagnosis and treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the rare case of successful outcome in a 61-year-old female who developed alveolar haemorrhage and acute respiratory distress syndrome 8 days after a chemotherapy session for her acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, in the context of secondary bone marrow aplasia. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was isolated in sputum culture. The patient benefitted from early empirical treatment with colistin followed by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, according to the antibiogram. Despite a severe initial clinical presentation in need of mechanical ventilation, neuromuscular blocking agents infusion, and ventilation in prone position, the patient had a favourable outcome and was discharged from intensive care after 26 days. CONCLUSIONS: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia severe pneumonia complicated with pulmonary haemorrhage is not always fatal in haematological patients. Empirical treatment of multidrug-resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in an immunocompromised haematological patient presenting with hemoptysis should be taken into consideration.","Andrei, Stefan; Ghiaur, Alexandra; Brezeanu, Lavinia; Martac, Cristina; Nicolau, Andreea; Coriu, Daniel; Droc, Gabriela",BMC Infect Dis,221,1

By adopting Normalization Process Theory and specifically ‘coherence’, we compare two large-scale agile transformation case studies and the different perspectives individuals and teams had when faced with the problem of operationalizing the agile method as part of their large-scale agile transformation. The key contributions of this work are: (i) this is a first attempt to present the results of a comparison between a successful and failed large-scale agile transformations; and (ii) we describe the challenges in understanding the rationale, differences, value, and roles associated with the methods to support the large-scale agile transformation.

For them, meaningful innovations are not necessarily related to the usage of new technologies but the optimization of some business process. In the literature, experimentation is described as an essential aspect of the innovation process. Although software engineering studies have explored experimentation, none has focused on software-intensive innovative projects in non-software-intensive companies, which consists of a contrast between the fast-changing environment in software-intensive to rigid structures in consolidated businesses. This paper proposes an experiment-oriented process to identify and implement innovation in this kind of company, including the roles involved in such processes. It has steps to identify business bottlenecks, search for solution alternatives, implement a fast and functional software proof of concept, create a plan for evolution, and migrate to a regular project to continue that idea. This paper also presents an evaluation of this process in a company focused on outsourced services, such as cleaning and maintenance.

Italian anthropologist codified the postmodern 'doing good only in states of emergencies' (Pandolfi, 2010). In times of Corona Covid 19 -2020 epidemiological freights we are urged to take this further into account, especially since witnessing racial stigmatizing on the basis of ethnicity and nationality. Paradoxically, Italy as one of the cradles of quarantines is facing the potential permanent closure of neighbouring borders rather than experiencing a historically practiced cooperation, as in the case with Croatia, over centuries (Blažina, Blažina 2015). If there should be a New Public Health (Baum 2016, 2019; Lupton 1997, 2000) it should be recalibrated by anthropological findings that re- focus towards the good of people, cultures and their cooperation. The work of this paper presents this urgent challenge. This anthropological research is a long-term follow up of Croatian medicine system dismantling (Špoljar Vržina, 2008 onwards) through a continuous analyses of micro (people), intermediary (governmental) and macro (international) changes (Bear et al. 1986), departures from functioning for the benefit of people and finding entry points for ethical corrective interventions. The analysis proved an existing switch of the public health paradigm from global health into states of neoliberal sickness, with clear possibilities of returning to 'health for all' if disengaging from the politics of culture/public health. Public health enhancements need to be based on the recalibration towards knowledges of populational and cultural realities. KEY MESSAGES: Reintroducing the ‘innovative’ wisdom of doing good for all regardless of emergencies is the core of a new public health agenda. The new public health agenda is based on recognizing cultures as pillars of communities and global societies that matter.","Špoljar Vržina, S",Eur J Public Health,221,1

Since the beginning of the emergency Healthcare Workers' (HCWs) involvement was prominent, mainly due to direct assistance to COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we implemented a prevention policy for HCW screening through serological and RT-PCR testing. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM: HCW screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential for prevention and control of the pandemic. Lombardy's Healthcare authorities settled a screening process for HCWs divided into three steps: 1) body temperature assessment at the beginning and the end of work shift, if fever > 37.5 °C was present the HCW was sent back home and a nasopharyngeal swab was performed; 2) progressive recruitment for serological testing; 3) on those positive to IgG a nasopharyngeal swab was performed and tested for viral RNA by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Among 79185 HCW tested, 9589 (12%) were positive on serological IgG testing. Of the 9589 positive a nasopharyngeal swab was performed on 6884. Of these 358 (5%) tested positive and the remaining 6526 (95%) negative to RT-PCR. We calculated a Positive Predictive Value of 5.2%. The rate of positive serological tests for each Healthcare facility varied between 0% and 78%. Five percent of all facilities, belonging to Brescia, Bergamo and Cremona area, reported a positivity rate higher than 40% in HCWs. A second cluster (18% of all facilities), involving the same geographical area, reported a rate between 20% and 40%, whereas the remaining facilities (76%) of the region a rate <20%. LESSONS: Serological IgG testing can be, if followed by immediate nasopharyngeal swab testing, a valid screening intervention on asymptomatic HCWs especially in a high infection prevalence setting. KEY MESSAGES: Serological IgG testing can be, if followed by immediate nasopharyngeal swab testing, a valid screening intervention on asymptomatic HCWs. Infection prevention in HCW may benefit from a screening campaign especially in high prevalence settings.","Del Castillo, G; Castrofino, A; Grosso, F; Barone, A; Crottogini, L; Toso, C; Pellegrinelli, L; Pariani, E; Castaldi, S; Cereda, D",Eur J Public Health,221,1

In our neonatology department, a second-level center, separate pathways were defined for Covid-positive (or suspected) and Covid-free patients at the beginning of March 2020; isolation rooms were identified, and indications were given regarding the management of the newborn in the delivery room and within the Neonatal Pathology department, with the aim of preventing the spread of the SARS-Cov-2 infection and encouraging breastfeeding. 1. Newborn who does not require intensive care, born of a mother in good condition and with a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab; follows the mother as she is transferred to the maternal ward of the Covid Hospital (superHub Padova). 2. Newborn born to a suspected mother, who does not require intensive or semi-intensive assistance; can be managed by favoring rooming-in, compatibly with the mother's conditions. 3. Newborn who needs intensive or semi-intensive care for neonatal reasons, born from a suspected or SARS-CoV2-positive mother; requires STEN - Neonatal Emergency Transport Service, according to the procedure and dedicated routes. 4. Newborn born to a positive or suspected mother, who has severe symptoms of respiratory infection or general state impairment; will be separated from the mother and placed in semi-intensive isolation in a dedicated incubator in the neonatal ward.

The role, timing and indications for surgical management are not well delineated and remain controversial for patients undergoing surgical stabilization of sternum fracture (SSSF). We sought to identify the national rate of SSSF in patients with a sternum fracture hypothesizing patients undergoing SSSF will have a decreased rate of mortality and complications. METHODS: The Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2015–2016) was queried for patients with sternum fracture. Propensity scores were calculated to match patients undergoing SSSF to patients managed non-operatively in a 1:2 ratio using demographic data. RESULTS: From 9460 patients with a sternum fracture, 114 (1.2%) underwent SSSF. After propensity-matching, 112 SSSF patients were compared to 224 patients undergoing non-operative management (NOM). There were no differences in matched characteristics (all p > 0.05). Compared to patients undergoing NOM, patients undergoing SSSF had an increased median length of stay (LOS) (16 vs. 7 days, p < 0.001), ICU LOS (9.5 vs. 5.5 days, p = 0.016) and ventilator days (8 vs. 5, p = 0.035). The SSSF group had a similar rate of ARDS (2.7% vs. 2.2%, p = 0.80), pneumonia (1.8% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.48) and unplanned intubation (8.9% vs. 5.8%, p = 0.29) but a lower mortality rate (2.7% vs. 11.2%, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Just over 1% of patients with sternum fracture underwent SSSF in a national analysis. Patients undergoing SSSF had an increased LOS and similar rate of all measured pulmonary complications, however a lower mortality rate compared to patients managed non-operatively.","Christian, Ashton B.; Grigorian, Areg; Nahmias, Jeffry; Duong, William Q.; Lekawa, Michael; Joe, Victor; Dolich, Matthew; Schubl, Sebastian D.",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,221,1

Although a complex and multi-faceted problem, inappropriate antibiotic use has repeatedly been identified as one of the main drivers of the acceleration and spread of AMR. Behaviors associated with antibiotic prescription and use have been extensively investigated in human medicine and in the livestock sector of veterinary medicine. There is now a growing interest in the factors that drive inappropriate antibiotic use in companion animal medicine, as the significance of antimicrobial use in this sector is being recognized. Additionally, the possibility of an alternative antimicrobial, phage therapy, being implemented into companion animal medicine is explored in this study. Interviews revealed complexities in the vet-owner relationship including conflicting perceptions of responsibility regarding antibiotic prescription and use, distrust of vets' intentions, and misconception of clients' needs. A need for alternative antimicrobials was evident, as all vets were able to report difficulties finding antibiotics to treat infections as a common occurrence. Questionnaire results indicated that vets and pet owners are open to the use of phage therapy in companion animals. This study shows that an alternative antimicrobial such as phage therapy could be accepted into companion animal medicine in the UK; however, effective communication between vets and pet owners is vital if antibiotic use is to be reduced and new antimicrobials are successfully implemented.","Rhys-Davies, Lucy; Ogden, Jane",Front Vet Sci,221,1

After reviewing academic and grey literature, and implementing a semi-structured survey, peacebuilding risked-adapted strategies to COVID-19 are explored with respect to conflict-affected and vulnerable areas of Colombia. Findings show that increasing complexity rooted in top down governmental measures, the rise of new local power relations (e.g. armed groups, illicit activities), and social alienation are negatively affecting peacebuilding in Colombia.

Meta-heuristic is emerging as a promising field of study for solving various optimization problems applicable to different CPS systems. In this paper, we propose a new meta-heuristic algorithm based on Multiverse Theory, named MVA, that can solve NP-hard optimization problems such as non-linear and multi-level programming problems as well as applied optimization problems for CPS systems. MVA algorithm inspires the creation of the next population to be very close to the solution of initial population, which mimics the nature of parallel worlds in multiverse theory. Additionally, MVA distributes the solutions in the feasible region similarly to the nature of big bangs. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a set of test problems is implemented and measured in terms of feasibility, efficiency of their solutions and the number of iterations taken in finding the optimum solution. Numerical results obtained from extensive simulations have shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches while solving the optimization problems with large feasible regions.","Hosseini, Eghbal; Ghafoor, Kayhan Zrar; Emrouznejad, Ali; Sadiq, Ali Safaa; Rawat, Danda B.",Appl Intell,221,16

Data were gathered from employees working in the real estate sector. The results inform organizational practitioners that they should leverage productive task conflict to channel work-related hardships, such as those created by the coronavirus pandemic, into creative work outcomes.

An inappropriate use of inventory management practices is among the causes. Hospitals suffer from demand and lead time uncertainty, and the current COVID-19 pandemic worsened the plight. The popular business logistics concept of risk pooling has been shown to reduce these uncertainties in industry and trade, but has been neglected as a variability reduction method in healthcare operations research and practice. Based on a survey with 223 German hospitals, this study explores how ten risk pooling methods can be adapted and applied in the healthcare context to reduce economic losses while maintaining a given service level. The results suggest that in general risk pooling may improve the economic situation of hospitals and, in particular, inventory pooling, transshipments, and product substitution for medications and consumer goods are the most effective methods in the healthcare context, while form postponement may be unsuitable for hospitals due to the required efforts, delay in treatments, and liability issues. The application of risk pooling in healthcare requires willingness to exchange information and to cooperate, adequate IT infrastructure, compatibility, adherence to healthcare laws and regulations, and securing the immediate treatment of emergencies. Compared to manufacturing and trading companies, hospitals seem to currently neglect the variability reducing effect of risk pooling.","Oeser, Gerald; Romano, Pietro",Oper Manag Res,221,13

During this process, microglia, which populate the embryonic brain and become a permanent sentinel myeloid population, are inexorably joined by peripherally derived monocytes, recruited by the central nervous system. These cells can quickly adopt a morphology and immunophenotype similar to microglia. Both microglia and monocytes have been implicated in inducing, enhancing, and/or maintaining immune-mediated pathology and thus disease progression in a number of neuropathologies. For many years, experimental and analytical systems have failed to differentiate resident microglia from peripherally derived myeloid cells accurately. This has impeded our understanding of their precise functions in, and contributions to, these diseases, and hampered the development of novel treatments that could target specific cell subsets. Over the past decade, microglia have been investigated more intensively in the context of neuroimmunological research, fostering the development of more precise experimental systems. In light of our rapidly growing understanding of these cells, we discuss the differential origins of microglia and peripherally derived myeloid cells in the inflamed brain, with an analysis of the problems resolving these cell types phenotypically and morphologically, and highlight recent developments enabling more precise identification.","Spiteri, Alanna G.; Wishart, Claire L.; King, Nicholas J.

However, its anticancer mechanisms have not been clearly defined. In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of 10-HDA in A549 human lung cancer cells. We used Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, scratch wound healing assay, flow cytometry, and western blot analysis to investigate its apoptotic effects and underlying mechanism. Our results showed that 10-HDA inhibited the proliferation of three types of human lung cancer cells and had no significant toxic effects on normal cells. Accompanying reactive oxygen species (ROS), 10-HDA induced A549 cell apoptosis by regulating mitochondrial-associated apoptosis, and caused cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in a time-dependent manner. Meanwhile, 10-HDA also regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways by increasing the expression levels of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p-p38, and I-κB, and additionally, by decreasing the expression levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p-STAT3, and NF-κB. These effects were blocked by MAPK inhibitors and N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Furthermore, 10-HDA inhibited cell migration by regulating transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), SNAI1, GSK-3β, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin. Taken together, the results of this study showed that 10-HDA induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in A549 human lung cancer cells through ROS-mediated MAPK, STAT3, NF-κB, and TGF-β1 signaling pathways. Therefore, 10-HDA may be a potential therapy for human lung cancer.","Lin, Xin-Mei; Liu, Shao-Bin; Luo, Ying-Hua; Xu, Wan-Ting; Zhang, Yu; Zhang, Tong; Xue, Hui; Zuo, Wen-Bo; Li, Yan-Nan; Lu, Bao-Xin; Jin, Cheng-Hao",Biomed Res Int,221,1

Having prior knowledge on differentially expressed genes in breast cell carcinoma elucidated important indications to understand the molecular mechanism underneath breast carcinogenesis. In this study we have investigated the distinguished CSN1S1 expression in human breast cancer. We have analyzed CSN1S1 mRNA expression between cancer and normal tissues using TCGA datasets. Moreover, analysis including promoter methylation, mutations, prognosis, co-expression, gene ontology, and pathways of CSN1S1 were performed by the TCGA Wanderer, UCSC Xena, cBioPortal, PrognoScan, UALCAN, and Enricher server. We have observed low mRNA expression and high promoter methylation of CSN1S1 in cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. Furthermore, we have also identified low mRNA expression in clinicopathological patients, as well as 9 deleterious mutations with highly co-expressed protein MRC1, and significantly related signaling pathways. We have found a positive correlation between the lower expression of CSN1S1 and patients surviving with breast cancer. Here we have concluded that CSN1S1 acts as a biomarker for the surveillance and prognosis of breast cancer, and also works as a novel therapeutic target at the molecular and pathway levels.","Mou, Mohsina Akter; Keya, Nawshin Atia; Islam, Majharul; Hossain, Md.

This paper establishes the deep connections between humanistic approaches of the Confucian tradition and liberal arts education by pointing to a common ground for the education of humanity. Ultimately, the purpose of liberal arts education, in the East as well as in the West, should be the liberation of human beings from the constraints of ignorance, prejudice and traditional customs and through the cultivation of a cosmopolitan morality that emphasizes unity, solidarity and the fusion of humankind. Chinese universities should contemplate the purpose and value of higher education in the 21st century and tap into the rich resources of Confucianism in order to give its liberal arts education a “soul.”","Cheng, Baoyan; Zhang, Donghui",Front Educ China,221,5

This paper proposes to use the more fluid concepts of imaginaries and hospitality, leaving behind stages and phases of adaption and acculturation, and focusing on the influence of the Structure on their experiences. Based on a discursive pragmatic analysis of interview data with 20 international students at a top Chinese university, the authors review how the students describe the kind of hospitality experienced at this institution and the influence that it has on their (mis-)encounters. Culturalist, differentialist and essentialist imaginaries (static and fixed views of Chineseness) are often used to justify the lack of encounters and the “segregation” and somewhat “positive discrimination” that they experienced. However, the paper shows that, amongst others, the institutional hospitality management for international students leads to closed contexts of encounters and feelings of exclusion. Although the study serves as a case study and cannot be generalized to the many and varied experiences of international students in other universities in China, some recommendations are made to solve, at least in part, misconceptions about what interculturality and hospitality entail in the internationalization of higher education.","Dervin, Fred; Härkönen, Anu; Yuan, Mei; Chen, Ning; Zhang, Wan",Front Educ China,221,1

The case when a state ceased to be an EU member is the first in the history of European integration. Except for the episode with Greenland, which left the EEC in 1985, the group had invariably expanded before that. The currently available extensive body of literature on Brexit is mainly represented by works dedicated to Britain. Fewer works are devoted to the European Union; they mainly address institutional issues, such as the ratio of supranational and intergovernmental management methods and the pros and cons of differentiated integration. This article poses the problem more broadly. Its goal is to clarify how Brexit will affect the strategic potential of integration, not its forms. The author concludes that, although the European Union suffers significant economic, political, and conceptual losses, Brexit paradoxically imparts dynamism to the integration process. There emerge preconditions for the formation of two competing democratic regimes in Europe. The new situation draws a line under the 30-year (since the fall of the Berlin Wall) period of ideological and institutional domination of the EU as the only possible model of European development. Competition with Britain can be extremely useful for the European Union to rethink its attitudes, reject dogmas, and develop a new ideology of integration that would meet not the conditions of bipolar confrontation but the challenges of mature globalization.","Butorina, O.

Multiple questions regarding the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of EVD vaccines remain unanswered. To address these gaps in the evidence base, the Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines (PREVAC) trial was designed. This paper describes the design, methods, and baseline results of the PREVAC trial and discusses challenges that led to different protocol amendments. METHODS: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial of three vaccine strategies against the Ebola virus in healthy volunteers 1 year of age and above. The three vaccine strategies being studied are the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine, with and without a booster dose at 56 days, and the Ad26.ZEBOV,MVA-FN-Filo vaccine regimen with Ad26.ZEBOV given as the first dose and the MVA-FN-Filo vaccination given 56 days later. There have been 4 versions of the protocol with those enrolled in Version 4.0 comprising the primary analysis cohort. The primary endpoint is based on the antibody titer against the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein measured 12 months following the final injection. RESULTS: From April 2017 to December 2018, a total of 5002 volunteers were screened and 4789 enrolled. Participants were enrolled at 6 sites in four countries (Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Mali). Of the 4789 participants, 2560 (53%) were adults and 2229 (47%) were children. Those < 18 years of age included 549 (12%) aged 1 to 4 years, 750 (16%) 5 to 11 years, and 930 (19%) aged 12–17 years. At baseline, the median (25th, 75th percentile) antibody titer to Ebola virus glycoprotein for 1090 participants was 72 (50, 116) EU/mL. DISCUSSION: The PREVAC trial is evaluating—placebo-controlled—two promising Ebola candidate vaccines in advanced stages of development. The results will address unanswered questions related to short- and long-term safety and immunogenicity for three vaccine strategies in adults and children.

Recent studies have shown that safety, security, and familiarity are the most referred positive attributes of home. Challenging this attenuation by scholars, negative or mixed meanings of home were highlighted in literary work and critics. Based on our integrative perspective bringing scientific and literary work together, we argue that pandemic might lead to changes in the meaning of home both in positive and negative directions simultaneously, inducing an ambiguous experience or even engendering a situated ambivalence. In this regard, we retrospectively inquired about the changes in home’s meaning in its social, personal, and symbolic attributes.

A total of 1285 genes were significantly upregulated by MH96 during infection; 829 genes responded to in vivo conditions during at least one stage of infection, 289 responded during two stages of infection, and 167 transcripts responded throughout all three stages of infection compared to in vitro conditions at equivalent cell densities. Genes upregulated during the earliest infection stage included components of the insecticidal toxin complex Yen-TC (chi1, chi2, and yenC1), genes for rearrangement hotspot element containing protein yenC3, cytolethal distending toxin cdtAB, and vegetative insecticidal toxin vip2. Genes more highly expressed throughout the infection cycle included the putative heat-stable enterotoxin yenT and three adhesins (usher-chaperone fimbria, filamentous hemagglutinin, and an AidA-like secreted adhesin). Clustering and functional enrichment of gene expression data also revealed expression of genes encoding type III and VI secretion system-associated effectors.

The Kremlin uses its direct or indirect presence in the key regional conflicts such as the Syrian, Libyan and Yemeni civil wars as well as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Iran’s nuclear issue. On the other hand, Russia is interested in building up stronger economic cooperation with the GCC, drawing bigger volumes of investments from the Gulf to Russia’s broken economy, as well as coordinating efforts with Saudi Arabia in the global oil market.

Hsa_circ_0001666 (also referred to as hsa_circ_000742) is a newly discovered circRNA that is upregulated in human papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) based on microarray analysis. However, the role of hsa_circ_0001666 in PTC progression remains unknown. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the potential function and underlying mechanism of hsa_circ_0001666 in PTC. The results demonstrated that hsa_circ_0001666 was upregulated in both PTC clinical samples and cell lines. Its expression was associated with lymph node metastasis of patients with PTC. Knocking down hsa_circ_0001666 expression inhibited cell proliferation, as evidenced by decreased cell viability, arrest of cell cycle progression at the G(1) phase and an increase in cell cycle-associated proteins. Apoptosis rates and expression levels of pro-apoptotic proteins were also increased by silencing hsa_circ_0001666. In xenograft experiments, the oncogenic effect of hsa_circ_0001666 on tumor growth was verified. Additionally, luciferase reporter assays showed that hsa_circ_0001666 and ETS variant transcription factor 4 (ETV4) shared common binding sites with three microRNAs [(miRNA/miR)-330-5p, miR-193a-5p and miR-326]. Knockdown of these miRNAs separately reversed the inhibitory effect of hsa_circ_0001666 small interfering RNAs on PTC tumor aggressiveness, and ETV4 overexpression also induced a similar effect to that of miRNA inhibitors. Thus, hsa_circ_0001666 may function as an oncogene, promoting PTC tumorigenesis via the miR-330-5p/miR-193a-5p/miR-326/ETV4 pathway. This provides a basis for identifying potential novel therapeutic targets for PTC.","Qi, Ying; He, Jingni; Zhang, Ying; Wang, Lidong; Yu, Yifan; Yao, Baiyu; Tian, Zhong",Oncol Rep,221,1

The polymerization initiator tri-n-butylborane (TBB) has been reported to significantly reduce the cytotoxicity of PMMA-based bone cement compared to benzoyl peroxide (BPO). However, it is unknown whether this benefit is temporary or long-lasting, which is important to establish given that bone cement is expected to remain in situ permanently. Here, we compared the biocompatibility of PMMA-TBB and PMMA-BPO bone cements over several days. Rat femur-derived osteoblasts were seeded onto two commercially-available PMMA-BPO bone cements and experimental PMMA-TBB polymerized for one day, three days, or seven days. Significantly more cells attached to PMMA-TBB bone cement during the initial stages of culture than on both PMMA-BPO cements, regardless of the age of the materials. Proliferative activity and differentiation markers including alkaline phosphatase production, calcium deposition, and osteogenic gene expression were consistently and considerably higher in cells grown on PMMA-TBB than on PMMA-BPO, regardless of cement age. Although osteoblastic phenotypes were more favorable on older specimens for all three cement types, biocompatibility increased between three-day-old and seven-day-old PMMA-BPO specimens, and between one-day-old and three-day-old PMMA-TBB specimens. PMMA-BPO materials produced more free radicals than PMMA-TBB regardless of the age of the material. These data suggest that PMMA-TBB maintains superior biocompatibility over PMMA-BPO bone cements over prolonged periods of at least seven days post-polymerization. This superior biocompatibility can be ascribed to both low baseline cytotoxicity and a further rapid reduction in cytotoxicity, representing a new biological advantage of PMMA-TBB as a novel bone cement material.","Saruta, Juri; Ozawa, Ryotaro; Hamajima, Kosuke; Saita, Makiko; Sato, Nobuaki; Ishijima, Manabu; Kitajima, Hiroaki; Ogawa, Takahiro",Materials (Basel),221,13

This study discusses critical aspects of the global pandemic for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). More precisely, we analyze how the new circumstances created by the pandemic have affected the interdependencies between SDGs. Following a synopsis of the current literature, we focus on effects regarding SDG3 (Health & Well-Being), SDG4 (Quality Education), SDG8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth), SDG12 (Consumption & Production) and SDG13 (Climate Action). Following a qualitative research approach, we based our analysis on moderated focus group discussions (FGD). Our observations reveal a unique pattern of interconnectedness between SDGs that can be related to COVID-19 consequences. Qualitative interpretations of focus group discussions also depict, that additional spillover effects can be obstacles for achieving SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 9 (Infrastructure & Innovation) and SDG 10 (Reducing Inequalities), SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals), SDG 11 (sustainable cities). Therefore, we consider the interdependent implications and recent trends in international development related to sustainability as a useful framework in the post-pandemic recovery period.","Shulla, Kalterina; Voigt, Bernd-Friedrich; Cibian, Stefan; Scandone, Giuseppe; Martinez, Edna; Nelkovski, Filip; Salehi, Pourya",Discov Sustain,221,1

It should further be noted that the main aim of developing and implementing local content policies is to crack the enclave nature of the oil and gas industry. The enclave of the oil and gas industry is not static; it changes based on economics, oil and gas demands as well as technological advancement. Though in the 1970s national content policies were implemented to integrate the local population into the oil and gas value chain, in 2020 and beyond the local content policies should develop skills, technology and R&D facilities that can avoid stranded assets in developing countries due to the energy transition. The need for certain minerals with the diminishing demand for oil and gas resources should all be addressed in a local content policy. Hence, though the enclavism of the oil and gas industry (extractive industry) evolves, the local content policy design should evolve as well for the local population to gain from the natural resources.","Muhongo, Rukonge Sospeter",Energy Justice,221,1

For some products, their accurate three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions are necessary for inspection [1]. The type of surface of the product plays a critical part in choosing a suitable 3D reconstruction method. The inspection of highly specular surfaces is still a limitation of most of the state-of-art 3D measurement techniques. Most of the available commercial solutions cannot inspect specular surfaces in ambient lighting conditions. This research paper focuses on a simple and accurate 3D measurement technique using laser and stereo cameras for the inspection of reflective surface objects. In this technique, a single laser line is projected onto the surface, and its stereo images are captured and processed for 3D reconstruction. The method overcomes the limitation of traditional methods and works robustly in ambient lighting conditions. As our experiments are performed in ambient lighting conditions, it is essential to project the right type of laser light on the object. Two different colours (Red and Blue) of laser lights are considered. Here, we reconstructed 3D profiles of three different shapes and estimated sizes of these objects using these two lights. This research article compares the output 3D profiles obtained using red laser light with which achieved using blue laser light. The results are quantitatively evaluated in terms of accuracy with the ground truth 3D model of the acquitted objects for accuracy evaluation. We also discuss the dependency on the specularity of the surface.","Dawda, Arpita; Nguyen, Minh",Geometry and Vision,221,1

The tracking of behaviors and emotions is becoming more pervasive with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), where small and always connected sensors can continuously capture information about human gestures, movements and postures. The captured information about readable behaviors conveys significant information that can be represented as time series. Few studies in emotion recognition and affective computing have explored the connection between the time series sensors data and the emotional behavior they conveys. In this paper, an innovative approach is proposed to study the emotions and behaviors connected to the time series data. A convolutional network augmented with attention-based bidirectional LSTM is introduced to represent the correlations between behaviors and emotions. The advantage of this model is that it can well recognized emotions by exploiting the data captured by sensors. The experimental results show that the proposed deep learning method outperforms separate schemes and achieves a high degree of accuracy for modelling human behaviors and emotions.","Deng, James J.; Leung, Clement H.

I can relate to how my clients are coping with the pandemic, particularly for those clients who have compulsive or addictive behaviors. With many of our adaptive coping mechanisms diminished, it is easy to fall back into destructive habits. During this time, I have turned inward to reflect on how my own experiences can help serve my clients. Rather than preaching abstinence, I find that harm reduction strategies, which help reduce compulsions or allow clients to engage in them more safely, are the most effective form of treatment. More than ever before, my work as a therapist is based in the tool of acceptance. Acceptance allows my clients to interrupt the cycles of shame that help feed addiction. Ultimately, this provides the opportunity to change behaviors. As I fight parallel battles during the coronavirus pandemic, I find that shared trauma provides rare moments of intimacy and connection that serve to deepen my client relationships.

In these attacks, attacker reveals secrets by observing cache lines evicted by the co-running applications. A precondition for such attacks is that the attacker needs a set of cache lines mapped to memory addresses belonging to victim, called eviction set. Attacker learns eviction set by loading the cache lines at random and then it observes their evictions as a result of victim access. We have found that the relation between the incoming memory location and the resulting evicted cache line eases the learning of an eviction set. In this paper, we propose Indirect Eviction Cache (IE-Cache) that is based on the principle of indirect eviction to harden the building of eviction set. In an eviction process of IE-Cache, incoming memory triggers series of replacements based on the cached memory addresses and a secure-indexing function, and the last replaced cache line is evicted. This increases the set size and introduces non-evicting cache lines in the eviction set. Through experimental results, we have shown that a 4-way set associative IE-Cache having 1MB and up to 3 replacements per eviction would require an attacker to generate [Formula: see text] memory accesses to learn an eviction set with 99% confidence. Moreover, it achieves 1–3% speedup compared to set-associative cache with a random-replacement policy on PARSEC benchmarks.","Mukhtar, Muhammad Asim; Bhatti, Muhammad Khurram; Gogniat, Guy",ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection,221,1

Increase in percentages of deformed or abnormal organisms and reduced size of the organism when they are exposed to heavy pollution mainly due to Hg, PAHs, and PCBs. It was observed that tolerant opportunistic species (Ammonia tepida and Buliminella elegantissima) benefit directly from organic contamination increasing their relative abundance. The other type of benefit may be indirect, as has occurred for Elphidium spp., which greatly increases its dominance due to the absence of other species that have had their shells dissolved first, resulting primarily from the impact of the oil spills. On the sedimentary and coral reef areas, Amphistegina gibbosa tests were not found at sites where reefs are walked upon. The presence of hard substrates and coarse sediment, rather than water depth, seems to be controlling the distribution of the tests.The results to date reaffirm the use of foraminiferal species in studies of oil spills, contamination by sewage, and industrial pollution even where the dissolution of carbonate is active due to low pH values. We then conclude that pollution or contamination of an environment overlaps the “natural” zonation and gradient of environmental factors, therefore limiting the establishment of species that are strategists and not opportunists.","Beck Eichler, Patrícia Pinheiro; Barker, Christofer Paul",Benthic Foraminiferal Ecology,221,22

Changes in land cover and land use have taken into account due to potential impacts on soil depletion, amplified run-off, water balance, and climate change. A detailed understanding of the characteristics of land exploitation and land structure is indispensable for the study of their influences on life and nature. In addition, urban extension is a major form of land extraction and land transformation, as it relates to the rise in population and the availability of financial services. Remote sensing records have been shown to be important for reporting and perceiving urban development and transition, and for providing critical information for future growth. Transformation and shift identification are the tools used to recognise distinctions in a land cover by tracking them at various times. In addition, various change identification and detection approaches are routinely tested with the goal of providing the greatest change detection deductions for a particular appliance. This review would aim to establish a practical plan that combines remote sensing techniques, on the one hand, and modelling approaches, on the other, to track land use, to cover changes, and to predict future trends.","Ennouri, Karim; Smaoui, Slim; Triki, Mohamed Ali",Circ.Econ.Sust.,221,11

After a number of conceptual clarifications, I discuss a range of arguments against the use of evil in moral and political thought. This engagement with ‘evil-skeptics’, however, aims to demonstrate that their arguments should compel us to develop a critical conceptual discourse of evil but not to abandon evil altogether. The central section of the chapter, then, consists of two parts: In the first, I introduce Hannah Arendt’s account of evil as a crime against (our common) humanity. The second part demonstrates more concretely the pertinence of Arendt’s ideas and insights for the problem of mass atrocities and, thus, provides the conceptual lens through which mass atrocities can be interpreted, understood and confronted.","Royer, Christof",Evil as a Crime Against Humanity,221,7

Their use also raises concern about misinformation and disinformation that cause serious harm to the patient–doctor communication and relationship. Such use might also induce the patient to make wrong decisions based on non-scientific knowledge or even provoke a threat to public health if a patient suffering from a contagious disease refuses treatment due to misguided advice. It is therefore perfectly understandable that all collectives involved are increasingly concerned about the need to regulate these activities in a way to serve the interests of all involved. This chapter analyses these issues from the perspective of the EU. It provides an updated commentary on the EU legal framework applicable to online activities in the digital environment in the healthcare context. We therefore analyse topics such as the regulation and policy tools developed by the EU concerning social networking communities and data-sharing platforms that include the sharing of sensitive information, such as health data, as well as the role played by patient organisations in improving available information. Moreover, we also highlight the main issues and gaps that currently exist and analyse the measures proposed by EU institutions to improve the situation.

In this paper, we propose a technique, based on Self-Organizing Maps, to address such problem by leveraging on the massive amount of historical system data that is typically available in these infrastructures. Indeed, our method consists of a joint analysis of system-level metrics, provided by the virtualized infrastructure monitoring system and referring to resource consumption patterns of the physical hosts and the virtual machines (or containers) that run on top of them, and application-level metrics, provided by the individual virtualized network functions monitoring subsystems and related to the performance levels of the individual applications. The implementation of our approach has been validated on real data coming from a subset of the Vodafone infrastructure for network function virtualization, where it is currently employed to support the decisions of data center operators. Experimental results show that our technique is capable of identifying specific points in space (i.e., components of the infrastructure) and time of the recent evolution of the monitored infrastructure that are worth to be investigated by human operators in order to keep the system running under expected conditions.","Lanciano, Giacomo; Ritacco, Antonio; Brau, Fabio; Cucinotta, Tommaso; Vannucci, Marco; Artale, Antonino; Barata, Joao; Sposato, Enrica",Cloud Computing and Services Science,221,1

Rather than representing nested types via their Church encodings in a higher-kinded or dependently typed extension of System F, we adopt a functional programming perspective and design a Hindley-Milner-style calculus with primitives for constructing nested types directly as fixpoints. Our calculus can express all nested types appearing in the literature, including truly nested types. At the term level, it supports primitive pattern matching, map functions, and fold combinators for nested types. Our main contribution is the construction of a parametric model for our calculus. This is both delicate and challenging: to ensure the existence of semantic fixpoints interpreting nested types, and thus to establish a suitable Identity Extension Lemma for our calculus, our type system must explicitly track functoriality of types, and cocontinuity conditions on the functors interpreting them must be appropriately threaded throughout the model construction. We prove that our model satisfies an appropriate Abstraction Theorem and verifies all standard consequences of parametricity for primitive nested types.","Johann, Patricia; Ghiorzi, Enrico; Jeffries, Daniel",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,221,31

Formally, DNNs are complicated vector-valued functions which come in a variety of sizes and applications. Unfortunately, modern DNNs have been shown to be vulnerable to a variety of attacks and buggy behavior. This has motivated recent work in formally analyzing the properties of such DNNs. This paper introduces SyReNN, a tool for understanding and analyzing a DNN by computing its symbolic representation. The key insight is to decompose the DNN into linear functions. Our tool is designed for analyses using low-dimensional subsets of the input space, a unique design point in the space of DNN analysis tools. We describe the tool and the underlying theory, then evaluate its use and performance on three case studies: computing Integrated Gradients, visualizing a DNN’s decision boundaries, and patching a DNN.","Sotoudeh, Matthew; Thakur, Aditya V.",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,221,1

Many scholars have begun to discover key suscessful factors of crowdfunding projects. Previous studies have used questionnaires survey to identify important project features. In addition to requiring a lot of manpower and time, there may also be sampling bias. Moreover, related studies also reported that the project description will affect the success of the crowdfunding project, but there is no research to tell fundraisers which success factors should be included in the content of the project description. Besides, in recent years, game crowdfunding projects have been attracted lots of attention in terms of total fundraising amount and number of projects. Moreover, in traditional feature selection and text mining approaches, the selected terms are un-organized and hard to be explained. Therefore, this study will focus on real video and mobile game project descriptions to replace conventional questionnaires. To solve these issues, we present a lexicon-based feature selection method. We attempt to define “content features” and build lexicons to determine the attributes’ values. Three feature selection methods including decision tree (DT), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and support vector machine–recursive feature elimination (SVM–RFE) will be employed to find organized candidate key successful factors. Then, support vector machines (SVM) will be used to evaluate the performances of candidate feature subsets. Finally, this study has identified the key successful factors for video and mobile games, respectively.

Ketamine, which has actually been around for over 50 years, is a dissociative anesthetic, used historically mostly for induction of anesthesia and functions via N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor complex inhibition. While the undesired dissociative effects have caused it to have limited, but necessary, utility as an induction agent, ketamine delivered at subanesthetic doses has shown to improve pain and depressive symptoms in patients suffering from chronic pain or depression refractory to standard treatment. Ketamine infusions are quickly becoming more popular among patients and providers as treatment alternatives for pain or depression that is not responding to the traditional method of treatment. Patients across the United States continue to be at risk of opioid abuse as the search for powerful non-opioid analgesia is still ongoing. Ketamine infusions delivered at subanesthetic doses may also be a possibility as treatment for patients suffering from opioid addiction. Currently, ketamine infusions are offered around the United States as an off-label treatment for chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and a variety of other psychiatric and neuropathic pain conditions.

Firstly, we introduce the supply chain fragmentation ratio that sums the volume of imports by all countries that participate in a particular supply chain. We find that supply chain fragmentation slowed down after 2010 for most goods, but not for services. We demonstrate the importance of using trade and production data at constant prices in measuring fragmentation trends. Secondly, we quantify the impact of fragmentation on the elasticity of trade to world GDP, extending the framework of Bems et al. (Am Econ Rev Pap Proc 101(3):308–312, 2011). We account for trade effects from fragmentation within supply chains as well as asymmetric shocks to final demand.

In the chapter, two ways of researching contradictions within social work is accounted for: (1) the interconnectedness between social work and capitalism, exemplified by how contemporary workfare policies in Swedish early twenty-first century draws on and refines arguments and assumptions that guided problematisations of Swedish poor relief in the period 1847–1875, and (2) the concept of social exclusion, exemplified by a number of research studies where the political conceptualisation of exclusion is critically scrutinised and another study that proposes an alternative analytical framework, where social exclusion is conceptualised as dynamic actor-oriented processes, initiated and carried out by specific actors acting out of certain motives.

Solnit Integrated Training Program (AJSP) is a novel educational initiative designed to prepare physician-scientists for independent careers in the investigation and treatment of childhood psychiatric disorders. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study to explore the impact and active components of the AJSP through hour-long individual interviews of its enrollees and graduates. We were specifically interested in identifying individual or programmatic traits for success that could be replicated elsewhere. As components of our theoretical framework, we used sources on Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat (SWOT) Analysis as applied to healthcare, and on mentorship and career development as pertaining to child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP). Results: Thirty-four individuals matriculated into the AJSP between 2004 and 2020, 33 (97%) of whom participated. Through iterative thematic analysis, we developed a model consisting of quadrants resulting from the intersection of a developmental perspective (spanning professional or personal spheres) and a reflective direction (with outward- or inward-facing vantage points). The model can be of practical utility through putative questions that trainees/program leaders could ask themselves by using the four domains as points of departure: (I) Individual: “Is becoming a clinician-scientist right for me?”/“What traits are we looking for in prospective applicants?”; (II) Program: “Is this the right program for me?”/“What is the right balance between structure and freedom for trainees to thrive in?”; (III) Mentorship: “What is the right number and constellation of mentors for me?”/“How can we optimize our experience and backgrounds toward the benefit of our trainees?”; and (IV) Charting Course: “Who do I want to become?”/“How can we help our charges embrace, find, or reconnect with their true vocation?” Conclusion: Our analytic approach can help identify, refine, and replicate programs that are urgently needed to increase the workforce of clinician-scientists dedicated to improving the well-being and mental health of children and families. The model we describe can be fruitfully applied to the self-reflection by individuals or program leaders.

With the proven entrepreneurial effectiveness in economic development and the efforts of scholars, policymakers and other stakeholders, competencies in entrepreneurship are becoming a set of essential learning objectives. In the digital era, entrepreneurship education can be made available in an online and blended format. Thereby, this study presents a systematic analysis of research focusing on blended and online entrepreneurial learning and teaching. Based on five keywords, collating an initial set of 121 articles, this systematic review details the research outcomes of the resulting set of 38 published research articles/contributions, where each described a specific online and blended learning environment. We obtained and analyzed the following information from each of these articles: definition of entrepreneurship education, context of study, methodology, applied technology, focused group, sample, outcome of entrepreneurship education and research rigor. Our findings showed that the current research status and achievements scholars have contributed in educational technologies utilized by online and blended entrepreneurship education can be summarized into three categories: social media, serious games and Massive Open Online Courses. In order to compare these technologies, we selected five examples from three educational technologies and utilized a marking sheet for evaluation and assessment. In general, it was found that Wiki was used to discuss entrepreneurial concepts and that Facebook was the most common social software in entrepreneurship education. In terms of serious games, FLYGBY and SimVenture facilitated the gamification and enjoyment of entrepreneurship activities the most. Finally, as Massive Open Online Courses platform, Coursera offers plenty of/online entrepreneurship education courses. In a nutshell, in online and blended entrepreneurship education, social media was utilized to facilitate cooperation amongst participants; serious games were used to enhance students’ enjoyment and engagement; and Massive Open Online Courses provided a platform as well as high-quality learning resources, anywhere anytime. Hence, each technology has advantages and challenges when we apply it to entrepreneurship education. We conclude that instructors and learners need to successfully compare and choose the most appropriate combination of technologies to achieve entrepreneurial course aims.","Chen, Li; Ifenthaler, Dirk; Yau, Jane Yin-Kim",Entrep Educ,221,1

In addition, little is known about the relationships between imposter phenomenon, compassion fatigue, and compassion satisfaction for mental health workers. Using a survey design with a convenience sample of 158 mental health workers, this study found that imposter phenomenon was positively associated with compassion fatigue, as well as negatively associated with compassion satisfaction, when controlling for years of work and age. Further, the combination of lower levels of compassion satisfaction and higher levels of burnout predicted higher levels of imposter phenomenon.

As the need to reduce COVID-19 transmission, many clinic providers have converted their in-person visits to video or phone visits. Our endocrinology clinic initiated tele visits early on when the pandemic had just started. Telemedicine may help with patient’s compliance by decreasing various burdens. Some studies show that patients and providers hope telemedicine will continue after the crisis. In this study we evaluated benefits and challenges of telemedicine in our endocrinology clinic. Patients who had a telemedicine endocrinology visit after informed consent were surveyed on 10 questions regarding benefits and limitations of the tele visits compared to the clinic visit. Patient also responded if they want to continue with telehealth after COVID-19 pandemic. Providers also were surveyed about the benefits and limitations of telemedicine and responded if they want to continue with telemedicine after pandemic. We also analyzed no-show rate from January 2020 through May 2020 for 6 weeks before and after the implementation of telemedicine. Among 109 patients who were interviewed 65% declared that they would like to continue with telemedicine after pandemic. Total of 42% of patients prefer video visit and 37% prefer phone calls. Among Interviewers 45% report benefit of spending less time, however 54% stat the time of meeting, itself was about the same. 54% believe they spent less money with telemedicine. 37% of interviewers report no limitation for telehealth while 25% report connection difficulty. 63% of patients state they do not have any difficulty traveling to the hospital. 90% of the patients declare all their question and concerns were responded and 77% stated the quality of care with telemedicine is almost the same via clinic visit. Among providers 75% want to continue telehealth after COVID-19 pandemic. 50% of providers mention patient satisfaction and 25% notice time saving as benefits. 46% of the providers mention lack of physical exam and 40% mention technology connection as the limitation for video visit. 60% of providers believe lack of exam is the limitation of phone visit. 87% of the providers believe the quality of care via phone is not like in clinic visit while 75% of the providers believe the quality of care is similar in video visit compare to in clinic visits. No show rate decreased from 30% to 27% after the implementation of telemedicine in 6 weeks prior and after pandemic. Endocrinology clinic has significant number of patients who need long term close follow up for medication adjustments, symptom checks and counseling. Given patients and providers satisfaction rate, telemedicine can be incorporated as part of regular clinic visits after the Covid crisis ends. Telehealth can be more efficient for both patients and providers but there are challenges which needs to be addressed.","Nemati, Maryam; Reddy, Archana; Jung, Syung; Nguyen, Jessica",J Endocr Soc,221,1

Peer reviewed data is sparse comparing glycemic control and clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients with vs. without DM2, and thus we sought to address this gap. Methods: We selected patients at least 18 years old who expired or were discharged between March 16, 2020 through September 15, 2020. Principal analysis compared glycemic patterns among patients with DM2 vs. non-DM2. Median, coefficient of variation (CV), maximum and minimum glucose parameters were computed to characterize longitudinal glycemic patterns. Logistic regression modeling identified significant (p<.05) associations between composite outcome vs. glycemic parameters and putative risks for progression to severe COVID-19. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve identified cut points for glycemic parameters. Cox regression models were employed to control for significant confounders. Continuous data summarized as median was compared using Kruskal-Wallis test. Discrete data were compared with Pearson’s chi-square test. Two-tailed p<.05 was significant. Results: Among 494 patients, 157 (32%) had DM2 with no intergroup differences in age (68 [56–79]), sex (52% male, 48% female), or race (68% Caucasian, 19% Other, 13% African American). Insulin was administered to DM2 (93%) and non-DM2 (54%) patients (p<.0001). Comorbidities were more prevalent in DM2, including cardiovascular (68% vs. 54%, p=.003), renal (72% vs. 52%, p<.0001) and obesity (51% vs. 38%, p<.0001). Markers including D-dimer (0.98 [0.61–1.95] mg/L), lactate dehydrogenase (308 [230–392] U/L), ferritin (436 [174–856] ng/mL), and triglycerides (172 [109–239] mg/dL), were not different in DM2 vs. non-DM2 (p>.05). CRP was greater in patients with (8.6 [3.6–14.6]) vs. without (6.1 [2.0–12.6]) DM2 (p=.005). Baseline glucose in DM2 (163 [121–253] mg/dL) vs. non-DM2 (107 [96–124] mg/dL) was significantly greater, with former an independent predictor of composite outcome (p=.0005). Cox modeling of other glucose parameters in DM2 vs. non-DM2 demonstrated various impact regarding risk for composite outcome including median (155 [128–209], p=.46) vs. (103 [94–118], p=.09); coefficient of variation (28 [19–38], p=.08) vs. (15 [9–20], p=.002); maximum (252 [187–362], p=.0005) vs. (129 [110–156], p=.002); and minimum (99 [79–128], p=.95) vs. (89 [81–98], p=.02). The unified baseline glucose cut point for composite outcome risk controlled for significant covariates was 138 gm/dL (p<.0001), which included respectively 20% and 10% of patients with and without DM2. Conclusion: Glycemic dysregulation in COVID-19 patients is independently associated with ICU admission and/or hospital mortality. Presence of DM2 amplifies glycemic dysregulation, but risk stratification appears warranted in all COVID-19 patients.","Rodriguez, Lisette Patricia; Farhangi, Vida; Braham, Julaine; Smith, Robert A; Wiese-Rometsch, Wilhelmine",J Endocr Soc,221,1

A 68-year-old male patient presents to Dos de Mayo National Hospital Emergency Department. He was diagnosed as COVID-19 pneumonia and hospitalized for management of acute respiratory failure. The patient had neurological impairment associated with poor oral tolerance. Initial laboratory examinations were C-reactive protein in 363.5 mg/L, serum sodium of 128.42 mmol/L and urine sodium was 83 meq/L. Osmolality in plasma was 266.15 mOsm/Kg and urine osmolality was 420 mOsm/Kg. Thyroid function tests as well as cortisol levels were in normal range. Our patient was diagnosed as SIAD by hyponatremia, osmolality in plasma <275 mOsm / kg, urine osmolality > 100 mOsm / kg, urine sodium > 40 mEq / l, euvolemic state and exclusion of cortisol and thyroid hormone deficiency. Treatment of hyponatremia was initiated and rapidly elevate plasma sodium by 4 meq/l in the first 6 hours. There was clinical improvement. Blood sodium levels ranged from 115 to 135 mmol/L with bolus therapy of hypertonic solutions in 72 hours. Intravenous boluses of hypertonic saline should be administered to rapidly elevate plasma sodium by 4 to 6 mEq/L in the first 6 hours. The data shows that fluid bolus therapy is more effective in acutely elevating plasma sodium than traditional low-dose hypertonic saline infusion that may lead to avoidable deaths according to recent guidelines. In this case a strategy based with bolus therapy for reversal of hyponatremia was used effectively. A number of cases of COVID-19 pneumonia are associated with SIAD. The presence of SIAD could be a clue to diagnosing COVID-19. SIAD is a major complication of COVID-19 and could be the first and only manifestation. In cases of SIAD without a clear etiology we should suspect COVID-19 in a patient with respiratory distress in the current pandemic. Syndrome of inappropiate antidiuresis (SIAD) should be assessed in every patient with COVID-19 as their treatment and early identification decreases mortality. The association between COVID-19 pneumonia and SIAD should be further identified, requiring doctors to be aware of this condition. Additional studies are required to determine the incidence and pathogenesis of SIAD in patients with COVID-19.","Miranda, Gonzalo Francisco; Rodríguez, Karen Evelyn Ramos; Research, Clinical",J Endocr Soc,221,1

INTRODUCTION: patients with heart failure (HF) are especially vulnerable to SAR-CoV-2 infection especially due to their worse prognosis for this disease. PURPOSE: to demonstrate that patients with HF will present similar health outcomes if their education and pharmacological treatment is optimised remotely by a nurse rather than through conventional care. METHODS: A single-centre, observational, prospective, non-randomized study was carried out in which two groups were compared. The experimental group had most of their care provided virtually by a nurse who could optimise their medication according to the clinical guides whilst the control group received conventional face-to-face care. During a follow-up period of 6 months, patients included in the study have an initial face-to-face consultation with a cardiologist and an evaluation of the patient where the treatment objectives are established. The rest of the follow-ups were done through videoconsultation with the nurse every 15 days for 6 months where the neurohormonal treatment was optimized and an educational program was carried out with different cardiovascular educational topics. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients have been included. Sex: 30 men (81.0%) and 7 women (19.0%) Mean age: 67.9 years (12.8). Range 42-87 years. Etiology: 61.2% ischemic and 38.8% non-ischemic mean LVEF at inclusion = 30.2%. A total of 17 patients have completed the study: a 13% average improvement of FEVI, a reduction of NT-proBNP of and improvement in functional heart failure class. The primary objective was to compare the proportion of neurohormonal drugs prescribed, as well as the mean of the maximum doses reached in each after 6 months of follow-up, as well as mean ejection fraction, NYHA class and mean NT-proBNP (Table 1) CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine offers us valuable tools that allow us to take care of chronic patients, reducing exposure to the virus as much as possible. Efficient use of virtual tools and human resources makes close monitoring possible.

A frequently intervened pathology is acute appendicitis, which could be affected by this situation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We propose a retrospective observational study on patients involved in our centre. They are divided into two groups, the preCOVID group with 123 patients surgically intervened between 15/03/19 and 31/12/19 and the postCOVID group with 101 patients surgically intervened between 15/03/20 and 31/12/20. We use T Student for quantitative variables and Chi2 for qualitative variables. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The preCOVID group, 54 males and 64 women. Average age 38.57. Average stay 3.33 days. There were 79 phlegmonous appendicitis, 27 necrotizing, 9 perforated and 8 plastron appendicitis. The postCOVID group, 57 males and 44 women. Average age 41.12. Average stay 4.27 days. There were 49 phlegmonous appendicitis, 33 necrotizing, 11 perforated and 8 plastron appendicitis. We observed statistically significant differences from time to intervention and intra-abdominal drainage placement, both being larger in the postCOVID group (p-0.038; p-0.037 respectively). We dońt found statistically significant differences in other variables. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in the postCOVID group are surgically intervened later, probably motivated by the need to perform a PCR to discount SARS-CoV-2, previously to intervention. More drains are also placed in this group, probably because more acute appendicitis is involved in higher severity phases than in the preCOVID group although there areńt significant differences in this regard.","Arango Bravo, A; Mateos Palacios, C; Pérez Prudencio, E; Soto Dopazo, M; Nuño Iglesias, C; Álvarez Laso, C J; Sosa Rodríguez, V",Br J Surg,221,23

We aimed to evaluate the association of 5-ASA with severe COVID-19 in a large cohort of IBD patients. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SECURE-IBD) registry, a large, international database of IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19. The primary outcome was severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, and/or death. Hospitalization due to COVID-19 was a secondary outcome. We performed multivariable regression modeling with a generalized estimating equation accounting for country as a random effect to analyze the association of 5-ASA with severe COVID-19. Models a priori included age, sex, race, disease phenotype (CD or UC/IBD-U), corticosteroid use, azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine use, TNF antagonist use, disease activity by physician global assessment, number of comorbidities, and days from SECURE-IBD inception to reporting. We constructed three models examining 5-ASA use as binary covariate using 1) all patients, 2) only patients on any biologic, and 3) only patients on TNF antagonists. RESULTS: 5,174 patients were included with 212 (4.1%) severe COVID-19 events. At the time of COVID-19 infection, 1,504 patients were taking 5-ASA. 5-ASA patients were older (mean age 44 vs. 38.3 years, p<0.001), more likely to have UC (70.7% vs. 27.7%, p<0.001), less likely to be in remission (49.6% vs. 57.2%, p<0.001), and more likely to have at least one comorbidity (33.6% vs. 26.7%, p<0.001) compared to patients not on 5-ASA. 3,325 patients were on any biologic and 2,216 were on a TNF antagonist. Among all patients, 5-ASA was not associated with severe COVID-19 (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86–1.52) (Table 1). Prior associations of age, comorbidities, TNF antagonists, and corticosteroids with severe COVID-19 were similar to prior analyses (Table 1). In analyses restricting to those on any biologic or only TNF antagonists, there was also no significant association between 5-ASA and severe COVID-19 (aOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.38–1.50 and aOR 0.99, 95% CI 0.43–2.32, respectively). Use of 5-ASA was not associated with risk of COVID-19 related hospitalization in any analysis.

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many routine procedures were postponed to reduce the overall burden on healthcare systems. We characterized the impact of COVID-19 on IBD care by conducting an exploratory analysis of real-world US healthcare claims data to identify changes in treatment patterns and the number of colonoscopy procedures performed in patients with IBD during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: De-identified, open-source health insurance claims data, from Jan 2019 to Oct 2020, were obtained from the Symphony Health Integrated Dataverse(®) for US adults aged 18–80 years with IBD. Four outcome measures were used: number of colonoscopies performed; number of new biologic treatment initiations or treatment switches; number of new biologic treatment initiations or treatment switches in patients who had a colonoscopy within the previous 60 days; and rate of telehealth consultations per 1000 patients per month. RESULTS: During Jan–Dec 2019 and Jan–Oct 2020, 1.54 million and 1.29 million patients with IBD, respectively, were included. The bimonthly number of colonoscopies remained stable throughout 2019, with a maximum change of +5.4% in Jul–Aug (N = 49947) vs Jan–Feb 2019 (N = 47399). Colonoscopy use decreased by 4.7% in Jan–Feb 2020 (N = 45167) vs the same period in 2019. In Mar–Apr 2020, colonoscopy numbers decreased by 55.3% (N = 20191) vs Jan–Feb 2020 (Figure 1a); a reduction of 59.4% vs Mar–Apr 2019 (N = 49780). In May–Jun 2020 (−23.8%) and Jul–Aug 2020 (+2.0%) the difference vs Jan–Feb 2020 gradually decreased (Figure 1a). Bimonthly numbers of new treatment initiations or treatment switches in 2019 varied by up to 6.9% vs Jan–Feb 2019. In May–Jun 2020, numbers of new treatment initiations or treatment switches decreased by 17.0% (N = 10072) vs Jan–Feb 2020 (N = 12133) (Figure 1b); a decrease of 19.3% vs May–Jun 2019 (N = 12488). The number of new treatment initiations or treatment switches in patients who had a colonoscopy within the previous 60 days decreased by 42.5% (N = 892) in Mar–Apr 2020 vs Jan–Feb 2020 (N = 1551) (Figure 1c); a decrease of 44.2% vs Mar–Apr 2019 (N = 1599). Telehealth utilization increased in March 2020 and remained higher than in 2019 up to October 2020 (Figure 2). CONCLUSION: Reduction in colonoscopies and subsequent initiation/switching of treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic first wave suggests lost opportunities for therapy optimization that may have an impact on longer-term patient outcomes. Increased utilization of telehealth services may have helped address gaps in routine clinical care.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate physical and mental health indicators in adolescents with preexisting chronic immunocompromised conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease(IBD) compare to healthy adolescents during COVID-19 quarantine. METHODS: A cross-sectional study included 355 adolescents with chronic conditions(IBD, n=44) and 111 healthy adolescents. An online self-rated survey was used to investigate socio-demographic features, healthcare routine and the quarantine impact on physical and mental health. Validated self-reported version of Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire(SDQ) evaluated psychosocial functioning. RESULTS: No differences were observed between adolescents with preexisting chronic immunocompromised conditions versus healthy adolescents during quarantine of COVID-19 pandemic for age, sex and ethnicity, as well as for household conditions and schooling(p>0.05). The frequencies of psychosocial functioning abnormalities according to total difficulties SDQ score were high and similar in patients and controls(30% vs. 31%, p=0.775). Logistic regression analysis showed that being female(OR=1.965, 95%CI=1.091–3.541,p=0.024), fear of underlying disease activity/complication(OR=1.009, 95%CI=1.001–1.018, p=0.030) were associated with severe psychosocial dysfunction in adolescents with chronic conditions, whereas school homework(OR=0.449, 95%CI=0.206–0.981,p=0.045), physical activity (OR=0.990, 95%CI=0.981–0.999,p=0.030) and sleep quality(OR=0.986, 95%CI=0.975–0.998,p=0.017) were protective factors. Further analysis showed similar median age, fear (disease activity/complication, immunosuppressive use, and COVID-19), physical activity, sleep difficulties, and total difficulties SDQ score in IBD adolescents versus with chronic conditions (p>0.05). The frequencies of psychosocial functioning abnormalities according to total difficulties score of SDQ were high and similar in IBD adolescents vs. chronic condition(37% vs. 29%, p=0.329), as well sleep difficulties(34% vs. 32%, p=0.797). CONCLUSION: Being female, fear of underlying disease activity/complication and household members working outside of home were relevant issues for adolescents with preexisting chronic conditions. We also demonstrated that adolescents with IBD during COVID-19 quarantine had high risk of adverse health indicators, particularly psychosocial functioning and sleep difficulties. This study reinforces the need to establish mental health strategies for teens with chronic conditions, particularly during pandemic periods.","Lindoso, L; Oba, J; Miranda, L C A; Deboni, M; Jiro Ozaki, M; Lima, D C C; Queiroz, L B; Astley, C; Gualano, B; Polanczyk, G V; Toma, R K; da Silva, C A A",J Crohns Colitis,221,1

MNP are potential contrast agents for different imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic particle imaging (MPI). Applied as a hybrid method (MRI/MPI), these are valuable tools for molecular imaging. Continuously synthesized and in-situ stabilized single-core MNP were further modified by albumin coating. Synthesizing and coating of MNP were carried out in aqueous media without using any organic solvent in a simple procedure. The additional steric stabilization with the biocompatible protein, namely bovine serum albumin (BSA), led to potential contrast agents suitable for multimodal (MRI/MPI) imaging. The colloidal stability of BSA-coated MNP was investigated in different sodium chloride concentrations (50 to 150 mM) in short- and long-term incubation (from two hours to one week) using physiochemical characterization techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for core size and differential centrifugal sedimentation (DCS) for hydrodynamic size. Magnetic characterization such as magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements confirmed the successful surface modification as well as exceptional colloidal stability of the relatively large single-core MNP. For comparison, two commercially available MNP systems were investigated, MNP-clusters, the former liver contrast agent (Resovist), and single-core MNP (SHP-30) manufactured by thermal decomposition. The tailored core size, colloidal stability in a physiological environment, and magnetic performance of our MNP indicate their ability to be used as molecular magnetic contrast agents for MPI and MRI.","Baki, Abdulkader; Remmo, Amani; Löwa, Norbert; Wiekhorst, Frank; Bleul, Regina",Int J Mol Sci,221,1

Here, we aimed to detect polysaccharides from Lycopi Herba and examine their potential immunomodulatory activity. A novel polysaccharide (LHPW) was extracted from Lycopi Herba and purified by DEAE-52 cellulose chromatography and G-100 sephadex. According to physicochemical methods and monosaccharide composition analysis, LHPW was mainly composed of galactose, glucose, fructose, and arabinose. NMR and methylation analyses indicated that LHPW was a neutral polysaccharide with a backbone containing →3,6)-β-D-Galp-(1→, →4)-β-D-Galp-(1→ and →4)-α-D-Glcp-(1→, with the branches of →1)-β-D-Fruf-(2→ and →6)-α-D-Galp-(1→. Immunological tests indicated that LHPW could activate macrophage RAW264.7 and promote splenocyte proliferation. This study discovered a novel polysaccharide from Lycopi Herba and showed it was a potential immunomodulator.","Zhang, Wuxia; Hu, Yihua; He, Jiaqi; Guo, Dongdong; Zhao, Jinzhong; Li, Peng",Front Pharmacol,221,1

In the secondary cell wall layer S2 of individual earlywood and compression wood tracheids, a systematic pattern variability was found. Several factors potentially affecting nanoindentation results were investigated, i.e. specimen orientation related to the indenter tip, cutting direction during specimen preparation, tip geometry, specimen and fibre inclination, respectively, and finally micro fibril orientation. Mechanical property measurements were correlated with structural features measured by confocal Raman spectroscopy. It was demonstrated that very high variability in the measurement of micromechanical cell wall properties can be caused by unintentional small fibre misalignment by few degrees with regard to the indentation direction caused by sub-optimal specimen preparation.","Konnerth, Johannes; Gierlinger, Notburga; Keckes, Jozef; Gindl, Wolfgang",J Mater Sci,221,1

METHODS: 74 patients with advanced GCA treated in the oncology department of Weifang People's Hospital (January 2019–January 2020) were enrolled in this study and equally split into study group (SG) and reference group (RG) according to the odd and even admission numbers. RG underwent chemotherapy alone, while SG received apatinib combined with chemotherapy. The clinical indicators of serum matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), serum interleukin-2 receptor (SIL-2R), and immune cell level were detected in the two groups before and after treatment to analyze the therapeutic effect of different treatment methods on patients with advanced gastric carcinoma. RESULTS: No obvious differences in gender ratio, average age, average BMI, pathological staging, pathological types, organ metastasis types, and residence were observed between the two groups (P > 0.05). The short-term follow-up results showed that the disease control rate (DCR) in SG was markedly higher compared with RG (P < 0.05). The MMP-9 and SIL-2R levels in both groups after treatment decreased (P < 0.05), and the levels in SG after treatment were notably lower compared with RG (P < 0.001). Compared with RG, CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD4(+)/CD8(+) levels in SG after treatment were notably higher (P < 0.001), while the CD8(+) level was notably lower (P < 0.001). The median progression-free survival (MPFS) and overall survival (OS) in SG were markedly higher compared with RG (P < 0.001). The GQOLI-74 scores in both groups after treatment increased (P < 0.001), and the GQOLI-74 score in SG after treatment was markedly higher compared with RG (P < 0.001). The total incidence of adverse reactions was lower in SG than in RG (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Apatinib combined with chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone in effectively improving treatment outcomes in patients with advanced GCA.","Yuan, Min; Wang, Zhaohui; Zhang, Yibo; Chen, Liying; Liu, Yuting; Cui, Cui; Sun, Bo",J Oncol,221,1

ZCCM was characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen physical adsorption, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersion spectrometry. The antibacterial activity of ZCCM against Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated by minimal inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal concentration and the influence of growth curves. ZCCM displays excellent antibacterial activity which is higher than ZnO-Montmorillonite, Cu(2+)-Montmorillonite and ZnO/Cu(2+)-Montmorillonite. In addition, the antibacterial mechanism of ZCCM was investigated by analyzing bacterial morphology, integrity of cell membrane, lipid peroxidation and the effect of histidine on antibacterial activity of materials. It is found that cell morphologies of bacteria are damaged and bacterial cells are shrunken. With the increase of cell membrane permeability, the intracellular dissolved matters leak continuously. What’s more, the reactive oxygen species are generated and biomacromolecules are oxidized.","Ma, Xiaoxia; Gao, Lingjuan; Ma, Yulong; Zhang, Xiaoguang",J Wuhan Univ Technol Mater Sci Ed,221,1

Simultaneously, artificial intelligence (AI) powered social media offers digital capabilities for organizations to select, screen, detect and predict problems with possible solutions through digital health data. Both the patients and healthcare professionals have benefited from such improvements. However, arising ethical concerns related to the use of AI raised by stakeholders need scrutiny which could help organizations obtain trust, minimize privacy invasion, and eventually facilitate the responsible success of AI-enabled social media operations. This paper examines the impact of responsible AI on businesses using insights from analysis of 25 in-depth interviews of health care professionals. The exploratory analysis conducted revealed that abiding by the responsible AI principles can allow healthcare businesses to better take advantage of the improved effectiveness of their social media marketing initiatives with their users. The analysis is further used to offer research propositions and conclusions, and the contributions and limitations of the study have been discussed.","Liu, Rui; Gupta, Suraksha; Patel, Parth",Inf Syst Front,221,0

Current fish oil aiming to prevent and treat CHD have shown a large variety of effects with low levels of evidence. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of fish oil for protection against CHD, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of fish oil for protection against CHD. METHODS: We retrieved relevant articles published from January 1966 to January 2020 by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases. RCTs of fish oil in preventing CHD were selected. The study quality was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool with RevMan 5.3 software. The first selection involved 360 citations. After screening and evaluation of suitability, 19 RCTs adjusted for clustering were included in the meta-analysis. All selected manuscripts considered that fish oil was effective in preventing CHD, secondary outcome measures included angina, sepsis and death. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, fish oil may confer significant protection against CHD (odds ratio = 0.84; 95% confidence interval: 0.72–0.98). There was no significant difference in the incidence of secondary outcomes between the observation group and the control group (P > .05). CONCLUSION: The above results show that fish oil plays an important role in reducing CHD and cardiovascular events. However, because of the suboptimal quality of the studies included into the meta-analysis, these results do not justify adding fish oils systematically to the heavy pharmaceutical assortment already recommended in CHD patients.

This may lead to misunderstandings which may impact on intercultural understanding and international collaboration. This article looks at how the Records Continuum Model, which was developed in Australia in the 1990s in response to the perceived deficiencies of the life cycle model to deal with digital records, is understood by francophone archivists and records managers. Misunderstandings can be attributed to problems of translation and transposition of Records Continuum ideas in other archival contexts, as well as to the specific terminology, which in itself is confusing because the terms used—in particular records, recordkeeping and continuum—have meanings that differ from their meanings in everyday language or in other cultural contexts. Through interviews with francophone archivists in Switzerland, the author explored their understanding of the model and the measures they were trying to put in place to encourage the creation of records and their preservation for as long as they would be needed by various stakeholders. The author shows that although the interviewees were all working within a life cycle framework, some of them were taking small “continuum actions” that can have a significant impact on the creation, management and preservation of records and on their ability to meet the needs of various stakeholders.","Frings-Hessami, Viviane",Arch Sci,221,1

A vertical discrepancy of about 4 mm was exhibited between teeth 11 and 12. To reposition the crown and gingival margins of the ankylosed tooth to an ideal level, single-tooth dento-osseous osteotomy and distraction of the block of bone containing the tooth was planned. In order to separate the roots of adjacent teeth for opening a space for osteotomy incision, fixed orthodontic treatment with multibracket appliances was initiated on her maxilla. After five weeks, a single-tooth dento-osseous osteotomy was performed using a piezoelectric device. To move the tooth in occlusal and buccal directions, two temporary anchorage devices (miniscrews) on her mandible and interarch elastics were applied. Approximately three weeks later, the ankylosed tooth successfully had an ideal position-relative to the adjacent teeth-and a harmonious gingival margin was achieved by minor gingivoplasty on all incisors.","Shahroudi, Atefe Saffar; Golmohammadi, Shima",Journal of orthodontics,221,12

We evaluated the performance of novices using a laryngoscope with a three-dimensional (3D)-printed ergonomic grip on an airway manikin. Forty second-year medical students were enrolled. Endotracheal intubation was attempted using a conventional Macintosh laryngoscope with or without a 3D-printed ergonomic support grip. Primary outcomes were intubation time and overall success rate. Secondary outcomes were number of unsuccessful attempts, first-attempt success rate, airway Cormack-Lehane (CL) grade, and difficulty score. In the easy airway scenario, intubation time, and the overall success rate were similar between two group. CL grade and ease-of-use scores were significantly better for those using the ergonomic support grip (P < 0.05).

CARTOLABE is made of two modules: the first relies on Natural Language Processing methods, converting a corpus and its entities (documents, authors, concepts) into high-dimensional vectors, computing their projection on the 2D plane, and extracting meaningful labels for regions of the plane. The second module is a Web-based visualization, displaying tiles computed from the multidimensional projection of the corpus using the UMAP projection method. This visualization module aims at enabling users with no expertise in visualization and data analysis to get an overview of their corpus, and to interact with it: exploring, querying, filtering, panning and zooming on regions of semantic interest.

However, the risk of experiencing significant postoperative pain may affect patient's decision making. We aimed to elucidate potential patterns of pain and the predictors of such, up to 2 years postoperatively, using both generic and specific quality of life tools. METHODS Patients undergoing laparoscopic totally extra-peritoneal inguinal hernia repair were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Short form-36, Surgical Outcomes Measurement System (SOMS) and Carolinas Comfort Scale (CCS) surveys were administered pre- and postoperatively at 3 weeks, 6 months, 1 and 2 years. Patients with concomitant procedures were excluded. Significant pain was considered mild but bothersome or worse on either specific tool (SOMS scores ≥3/4, CCS scores ≥2). Predictors of significant pain were determined by logistic regression. RESULTS From 2009 to 2015, 482 patients enrolled in our database underwent elective TEP repair of 626 hernias and completed an assessment tool. Mean age was 57 (±15) years, with 93 % male.

Significant pain on either specific tool, related or unrelated to surgery, was reported by 52 % of respondents (158/301) preoperatively, and postoperatively by 50 % at 3 weeks (111/220), 21 % at 6 months (15/70), 13 % at 1 year (14/108), and 25 % at 2 years (30/121). Significant pain at 6 months-2 years correlated more significantly with general health status than surgical factors. CONCLUSIONS Significant pain can be as high as 50 % at 3 weeks on surgery-specific quality of life measures, but with significant improvement by 6 months which is maintained through 2 years. Poor quality of life and general health were the main predictors of pain after 6 months.","Patel, Lava Y; Lapin, Brittany; Gitelis, Matthew E; Brown, Craig; Linn, John G; Haggerty, Stephen; Denham, Woody; Butt, Zeeshan; Barrera, Ermilo; Joehl, Ray; Carbray, JoAnn; Hall, Tyler; Ujiki, Michael B",Surgical endoscopy,221,2

The source and evolutionary history of this virus is, however, unknown. PDCoV belongs to the Deltacoronavirus genus that comprises predominantly avian CoV. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that PDCoV originated relatively recently from a host-switching event between birds and mammals. Insight into receptor engagement by PDCoV may shed light into such an exceptional phenomenon. Here we report that PDCoV employs host aminopeptidase N (APN) as an entry receptor and interacts with APN via domain B of its spike (S) protein. Infection of porcine cells with PDCoV was drastically reduced by APN knockout and rescued after reconstitution of APN expression. In addition, we observed that PDCoV efficiently infects cells of unusual broad species range, including human and chicken. Accordingly, PDCoV S was found to target the phylogenetically conserved catalytic domain of APN. Moreover, transient expression of porcine, feline, human, and chicken APN renders cells susceptible to PDCoV infection. Binding of PDCoV to an interspecies conserved site on APN may facilitate direct transmission of PDCoV to nonreservoir species, including humans, potentially reflecting the mechanism that enabled a virus, ancestral to PDCoV, to breach the species barrier between birds and mammals. The APN cell surface protein is also used by several members of the Alphacoronavirus genus. Hence, our data constitute the second identification of CoVs from different genera that use the same receptor, implying that CoV receptor selection is subjected to specific restrictions that are still poorly understood.","Li, Wentao; Hulswit, Ruben J G; Kenney, Scott P; Widjaja, Ivy; Jung, Kwonil; Alhamo, Moyasar A; van Dieren, Brenda; van Kuppeveld, Frank J M; Saif, Linda J; Bosch, Berend-Jan",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,221,8

Beyond the Hippocratic notion of doing no harm, nephrologists also have duties to respect their patients' autonomy and dignity, to meet their patients' care goals in the least invasive way, to act impartially, and, ultimately, to do what is (clinically) beneficial for their patients. Juggling these often-conflicting duties can be challenging at the best of times, but can prove especially difficult when patients are not fully adherent to treatment. When a patient's nonadherence begins to cause harm to themselves and/or others, it may be questioned whether discontinuation of care is appropriate. We discuss how nephrologists can meet their ethical duties when faced with nonadherence in patients undergoing hemodialysis, including episodic extreme agitation, poor renal diet, missed hemodialysis sessions, and emergency presentations brought on by nonadherence. Furthermore, we consider the impact of cognitive impairment and provider-family conflict when making care decisions in a nonadherence context, as well as how the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic might affect responses to nonadherence.

METHODS A systematic literature search (1950-2017) of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library was performed (CRD42017071305). Studies assessing symptomatic relief or symptomatic recurrence after laparoscopic fenestration in patients with symptomatic, non-parasitic, hepatic cysts were included. Complications were scored according to Clavien-Dindo. Methodological quality was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) for cohort studies. Pooled estimates were calculated using a random effects model for meta-analysis. RESULTS Out of 5277 citations, 62 studies with a total of 1314 patients were included. Median NOS-score was 6 out of 9. Median follow-up duration was 30 months. Symptomatic relief after laparoscopic fenestration was 90.2% (95% CI 84.3-94.9). Symptomatic recurrence was 9.6% (95% CI 6.9-12.8) and reintervention rate was 7.1% (95% CI 5.0-9.4). Post-operative complications occurred in 10.8% (95% CI 8.1-13.9) and major complications in 3.3% (95% CI 2.1-4.7) of patients. Procedure-related mortality was 1.0% (95% CI 0.5-1.6). In a subgroup analysis of PLD patients (n = 146), symptomatic recurrence and reintervention rates were significantly higher with respective rates of 33.7% (95% CI 18.7-50.4) and 26.4% (95% CI 12.6-43.0). Complications were more frequent in PLD patients, with a rate of 29.3% (95% CI 16.0-44.5). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic fenestration is an effective procedure for treatment of symptomatic hepatic cysts with a low symptomatic recurrence rate. The symptomatic recurrence rate and risk of complications are significantly higher in PLD patients.","Bernts, Lucas H P; Echternach, Sebastiaan G; Kievit, Wietske; Rosman, Camiel; Drenth, Joost P H",Surgical endoscopy,221,1

The clinical application of monopolar energy is not without risk. Monopolar electrosurgical energy was introduced into surgical practice at the turn of the 20th century. Alternate site burns during laparotomic application were the most common complication for the first half century (i.e., ground point burns and dispersive electrode burns [1920-1970]). The aims of this article were to discuss historic design flaws associated with the most common alternate site burns, ground point burns, and dispersive electrode burns and the technological advancements introduced to mitigate these risks to the patient and to discuss current design flaws associated with stray energy burns during laparoscopy because of insulation failure and capacitive coupling and the technological advancements introduced to eliminate these risks to the patient. Today, insulation failure and capacitive coupling are the most common reasons for electrosurgical injury during laparocopic procedures.

The nonstructural B19 protein NS1 acts as a transactivator triggering signaling cascades that eventually lead to activation of interleukin 6 (IL-6). We examined the impact of NS1 on modulation of STAT signaling in human endothelial cells (HMEC-1). The NS1 sequences were identified from B19 DNA isolated from the myocardia of patients with fatal iCMP. B19 infection as well as NS1 overexpression in HMEC-1 cells produced a significant upregulation in the phosphorylation of both tyrosine(705) and serine(727) STAT3 (P < 0.05). The increased STAT3 phosphorylation was accompanied by dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding of pSTAT3. In contrast, NS1 expression did not result in increased STAT1 activation. Notably, the expression levels of the negative regulators of STAT activation, SOCS1 and SOCS3, were not altered by NS1. However, the level of PIAS3 was upregulated in NS1-expressing HMEC-1 cells. Analysis of the transcriptional activation of target genes revealed that NS1-induced STAT3 signaling was associated with upregulation of genes involved in immune response (e.g., the IFNAR1 and IL-2 genes) and downregulation of genes associated with viral defense (e.g., the OAS1 and TYK2 genes). Our results demonstrate that B19 NS1 modulates the STAT/PIAS pathway. The NS1-induced upregulation of STAT3/PIAS3 in the absence of STAT1 phosphorylation and the lack of SOCS1/SOCS3 activation may contribute to the mechanisms by which B19 evades the immune response and establishes persistent infection in human endothelial cells. Thus, NS1 may play a critical role in the mechanism of viral pathogenesis in B19-associated iCMP.","Duechting, Anja; Tschöpe, Carsten; Kaiser, Heike; Lamkemeyer, Tobias; Tanaka, Nobuyuki; Aberle, Susanne; Lang, Florian; Torresi, Joseph; Kandolf, Reinhard; Bock, C-Thomas",Journal of virology,221,1
76330,76330,76330,Frontlines: Going the Distance in a World Turned Upside Down.,13.786006,3.3867567,2020-07-01,"OBJECTIVE Hypoxemia is common during one-lung ventilation (OLV) for thoracic surgery. When hypoxemia occurs, surgery is interrupted for rescue ventilation. Apneic oxygen insufflation (AOI), which provides O2 without applying pressure, may prevent hypoxemia and does not interrupt surgery. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the AOI technique for preventing hypoxemia during OLV in thoracic surgery. METHODS Patients undergoing open or thoracoscopic pulmonary lobectomy from September to December 2015 were included. Patients were assigned randomly to a non-AOI group or an AOI group (n = 45 each). OLV was initiated and at the 15-minute mark (OLV15), patients in the AOI group received oxygen insufflation at 3 L/min to the nonventilated lung for 30 minutes (OLV45). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of hypoxemia (SaO2 <90%) during OLV. RESULTS The demographic and operative data were similar between the 2 groups. The incidence of hypoxemia was greater in the non-AOI than the AOI group (18% vs 0%; P = .009). ΔPaO2 (the difference in partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood between OLV 45 and 15 minutes) was smaller in the AOI than the non-AOI group (-29 mm Hg vs -69 mm Hg; P = .005). Duration of surgery and incidence of complications did not vary between groups. CONCLUSIONS AOI decreases the incidence of hypoxemia and improves arterial oxygenation during OLV for open and thoracoscopic surgery. AOI may be a valuable option to prevent hypoxemia. It can be used before relying on continuous positive airway pressure or intermittent two-lung ventilation and result in fewer interruptions in surgery.","Jung, Dae Myung; Ahn, Hyun Joo; Jung, Sin-Ho; Yang, Mikyung; Kim, Jie Ae; Shin, Su Min; Jeon, Suyong",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,221,1

Most institutions recommend the use of heparin to prevent occlusion; there is debate, however, regarding the need for heparin and evidence to suggest normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) may be as effective. The use of heparin is not without risk, may be unnecessary and is also associated with increased cost. This is an update of the review published in 2015. OBJECTIVES To assess the clinical effects (benefits and harms) of intermittent flushing of normal saline versus heparin to prevent occlusion in long-term central venous catheters in infants and children. SEARCH METHODS The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases; World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials register to 9 April 2019. We also undertook reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the efficacy of intermittent flushing with normal saline versus heparin to prevent occlusion of long-term CVCs in infants and children aged up to 18 years of age. We excluded temporary CVCs and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed trial inclusion criteria, trial quality and extracted data. We assessed study quality with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the rate ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). We pooled data using a random-effects model; and we used GRADE to assess the overall certainty of the evidence supporting the outcomes assessed in this review. MAIN RESULTS We identified one new study for this update, bringing the total number of included studies to four (255 participants). The four trials directly compared the use of normal saline and heparin; the studies all used different protocols for the intervention and control arms, however, and all used different concentrations of heparin. Different frequencies of flushes were also reported between studies. In addition, not all studies reported on all outcomes. The certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low because there was no blinding; heterogeneity and inconsistency between studies was high; and the CIs were wide. CVC occlusion was assessed in all four trials. We were able to pool the results of two trials for the outcomes of CVC occlusion and CVC-associated blood stream infection. The estimated RR for CVC occlusion per 1000 catheter days between the normal saline and heparin groups was 0.75 (95% CI 0.10 to 5.51; 2 studies, 229 participants; very low certainty evidence). The estimated RR for CVC-associated blood stream infection was 1.48 (95% CI 0.24 to 9.37; 2 studies, 231 participants; low-certainty evidence). The duration of catheter placement was reported to be similar for the two study arms in one study (203 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and not reported in the remaining studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The review found that there was not enough evidence to determine the effects of intermittent flushing with normal saline versus heparin to prevent occlusion in long-term central venous catheters in infants and children. It remains unclear whether heparin is necessary to prevent occlusion, CVC-associated blood stream infection or effects duration of catheter placement. Lack of agreement between institutions around the world regarding the appropriate care and maintenance of these devices remains.","Bradford, Natalie K; Edwards, Rachel M; Chan, Raymond J",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,221,8

DESIGN Cross-sectional comparison of national surveys. PARTICIPANTS Participants in: 2016 American Community Survey, the 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the 2016 National Health Interview Survey, the 1999-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health. METHODS We estimated VI and blindness prevalence rates and confidence intervals for each survey measure and age-group using the Clopper-Pearson method. We then estimated weighted self-reported VI and blindness prevalence rates across survey measures by age-group using inverse variance weighting, fitted trend lines to age-group estimates, and used the trend-line equations to estimate the number of U.S. persons with VI and blindness in 2016. We compared these self-report estimates to those generated from NHANES physical evaluations of presenting VI and blindness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The variability of prevalence estimates of VI and blindness RESULTS: Survey response estimates of blindness varied between 0.1% and 5.6% for age-groups <65 years and between 0.6% to 16.6% for ages >=65. Estimates of VI varied between 1.6% and 24.8% for age-groups <65 years and between 2.2% and 26.6% for age-groups >=65. For summarized survey results and NHANES physical evaluation, prevalence rates for VI increased significantly with age-group. Blindness prevalence increased significantly with age-group for summarized survey responses but not for NHANES physical examination. Based on extrapolations of NHANES physical examination data to all ages, we estimated that in 2016, 23.4 million persons in the U.S. (7.2%) had VI or blindness, an evaluated visual acuity of 20/40 or worse in the better-seeing eye before correction; based on weighted self-reported surveys, we estimated 24.8 million persons (7.7%) had presenting VI or blindness. CONCLUSIONS Prevalence rates of VI and blindness obtained from national survey measures varied widely across surveys and age-groups. Additional research is needed to validate the ability of survey self-report measures of VI and blindness to replicate results obtained through clinical exam by an eye health professional.","Rein, David B; Lamuda, Phoebe A; Wittenborn, John S; Okeke, Nnenna; Davidson, Clare E; Swenor, Bonnielin K; Saaddine, Jinan; Lundeen, Elizabeth A",Ophthalmology,221,1

We aimed to determine the relationship between blood alcohol concentration and brain function (as measured by BIS) in healthy adults. METHODS In this prospective observational study, 21 anaesthetic registrars self-regulated alcohol consumption over a 3-h period. Expired alcohol concentration (breathalyser) and BIS measurements were performed hourly for 4 h. A venous blood alcohol sample was taken at the conclusion of the study period. RESULTS The main outcome measures were the correlation between blood alcohol and brain function as measured by BIS and the change in BIS from baseline (∆BIS) at 4 h. The median number of standard drinks consumed was 9.1 (IQR 7.7-12.3), range 5.4-17. At 4 h, there was a moderate inverse correlation between BIS and blood alcohol (r = -0.49, P = 0.029) and between ∆BIS and blood alcohol (r = -0.46, P =0.043). CONCLUSION In healthy young adults, we found a moderate correlation between venous blood alcohol concentration and BIS. This suggests that acute alcohol consumption can decrease BIS. This information may be relevant when providing anaesthesia to intoxicated patients who require urgent or time-critical surgery, although certain limitations of this study should be kept in mind.","Gerstman, M D; Merry, A F; McIlroy, D R; Hannam, J A; Mitchell, S J; Myles, P S",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,221,10

Linear and angular kinematic data were collected from 31-39 m. The results supported the hypotheses, as across all subjects and trials (range of speeds: 3.1-10.0 m s-1), measures of thigh angular velocity demonstrated a strong positive linear correlation to speed (all R 2 >0.70, p<0.0001) and lower limb vertical velocity at touchdown (all R 2 =0.75, p<0.0001).

One patient had both epileptic (ES) and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) while 10 had PNES and 9 had ES. In 8 of 9 patients with ES, medications were changed, while in 5 patients with PNES, anti-epileptic drugs (AED) were stopped; the remaining 5 were not on medications. Of the 14 patients who had seen an epileptologist pre-admission, 13 (or 93%) had their diagnosis confirmed by EMU stay; a statistically significant finding. While typically an elective admission, in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, urgent and emergent EMU admissions were required for increased seizure or event frequency. In the vast majority of patients (13 of 19), admission lead to medication changes to either better control seizures or to change therapeutics as appropriate when PNES was identified.","Zepeda, Rodrigo; Lee, Yoona; Agostini, Mark; Alick Lindstrom, Sasha; Dave, Hina; Dieppa, Marisara; Ding, Kan; Doyle, Alexander; Harvey, Jay; Hays, Ryan; Perven, Ghazala; Podkorytova, Irina; Das, Rohit R",The Neurodiagnostic journal,221,7

DESIGN Phase II randomised, single blinded, parallel clinical trial. SETTING Eight tertiary neonatal intensive care units in eight European countries. PARTICIPANTS 166 extremely preterm infants born before 28 weeks of gestation: 86 were randomised to cerebral NIRS monitoring and 80 to blinded NIRS monitoring. The only exclusion criterion was a decision not to provide life support. INTERVENTIONS Monitoring of cerebral oxygenation using NIRS in combination with a dedicated treatment guideline during the first 72 hours of life (experimental) compared with blinded NIRS oxygenation monitoring with standard care (control). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure was the time spent outside the target range of 55-85% for cerebral oxygenation multiplied by the mean absolute deviation, expressed in %hours (burden of hypoxia and hyperoxia). One hour with an oxygenation of 50% gives 5%hours of hypoxia. Secondary outcomes were all cause mortality at term equivalent age and a brain injury score assessed by cerebral ultrasonography. RANDOMISATION Allocation sequence 1:1 with block sizes 4 and 6 in random order concealed for the investigators. The allocation was stratified for gestational age (<26 weeks or ≥ 26 weeks). BLINDING Cerebral oxygenation measurements were blinded in the control group. All outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation. RESULTS The 86 infants randomised to the NIRS group had a median burden of hypoxia and hyperoxia of 36.1%hours (interquartile range 9.2-79.5%hours) compared with 81.3 (38.5-181.3) %hours in the control group, a reduction of 58% (95% confidence interval 35% to 73%, P<0.001). In the experimental group the median burden of hypoxia was 16.6 (interquartile range 5.4-68.1) %hours, compared with 53.6 (17.4-171.3) %hours in the control group (P=0.0012). The median burden of hyperoxia was similar between the groups: 1.2 (interquartile range 0.3-9.6) %hours in the experimental group compared with 1.1 (0.1-23.4) %hours in the control group (P=0.98). We found no statistically significant differences between the two groups at term corrected age. No severe adverse reactions were associated with the device.

Since the first reported EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, several small outbreaks have been reported in central Africa with about 2,400 cases occurring between 1976 and 2013. The 2013-2015 EVD outbreak in west Africa is the first documented outbreak in this region and the largest ever with over 27,000 cases and more than 11,000 deaths. Although EVD transmission rates have recently decreased in west Africa, this crisis continues to threaten global health and security, particularly since infected travelers could spread EVD to other resource-limited areas of the world. Because vaccines and drugs are not yet licensed for EVD, outbreak control is dependent on the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., infection control practices, isolation of EVD cases, contact tracing with follow-up and quarantine, sanitary burial, health education). However, delays in diagnosing and reporting EVD cases in less accessible rural areas continue to hamper control efforts. New advances in rapid diagnostics for identifying presumptive EVD cases and in mobile-based technologies for communicating critical health-related information should facilitate deployment of an early response to prevent the amplification of sporadic EVD cases into large-scale outbreaks.","Stamm, Lola V",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,221,16

Here, we demonstrate that CCHFV nucleocapsid protein (CCHFV-NP) augments mRNA translation. CCHFV-NP binds to the viral mRNA 5' untranslated region (UTR) with high affinity. It facilitates the translation of reporter mRNA both in vivo and in vitro with the assistance of the viral mRNA 5' UTR. CCHFV-NP equally favors the translation of both capped and uncapped mRNAs, demonstrating the independence of this translation strategy on the 5' cap. Unlike the canonical host translation machinery, inhibition of eIF4F complex, an amalgam of three initiation factors, eIF4A, eIF4G, and eIF4E, by the chemical inhibitor 4E1RCat did not impact the CCHFV-NP-mediated translation mechanism. However, the proteolytic degradation of eIF4G alone by the human rhinovirus 2A protease abrogated this translation strategy. Our results demonstrate that eIF4F complex formation is not required but eIF4G plays a critical role in this translation mechanism. Our results suggest that CCHFV has adopted a unique translation mechanism to facilitate the translation of viral mRNAs in the host cell cytoplasm where cellular transcripts are competing for the same translation apparatus.IMPORTANCE Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, a highly contagious viral disease endemic to more than 30 countries, has limited treatment options. Our results demonstrate that NP favors the translation of a reporter mRNA harboring the viral mRNA 5' UTR. It is highly likely that CCHFV uses an NP-mediated translation strategy for the rapid synthesis of viral proteins during the course of infection. Shutdown of this translation mechanism might selectively impact viral protein synthesis, suggesting that an NP-mediated translation strategy is a target for therapeutic intervention against this viral disease.","Jeeva, Subbiah; Cheng, Erdong; Ganaie, Safder S; Mir, Mohammad A",Journal of virology,221,28

Understanding of the immune response and biomarker analysis is needed to progress toward understanding disease pathology and developing improved treatment options. The goal of this study is to identify pathogenic factors that are linked to disease severity and patient characteristics. Patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized from March 17 to June 5, 2020 were analyzed for clinical features of disease and soluble plasma cytokines in association with disease severity and sex. Data from COVID-19 patients with acute illness were examined along with an age- and gender-matched control cohort. We identified a group of 16 soluble factors that were found to be increased in COVID-19 patients compared to controls, whereas 2 factors were decreased. In addition to inflammatory cytokines, we found significant increases in factors known to mediate vasculitis and vascular remodeling (PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB-BB, soluble CD40L (sCD40L), FGF, and IP10). Four factors such as platelet-derived growth factors, fibroblast growth factor-2, and IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 were strongly associated with severe disease and ICU admission. Th2-related factors (IL-4 and IL-13) were increased with IL-4 and sCD40L present at increased levels in males compared with females. Our analysis revealed networking clusters of cytokines and growth factors, including previously unknown roles of vascular and stromal remodeling, activation of the innate immunity, as well activation of type 2 immune responses in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19.

METHODS Adults aged 18-64 years with current private (n=124,746), public (n=30,932), or no (n=31,802) insurance coverage were identified from the 2011-2018 National Health Interview Survey. Data were analyzed in 2020. Separate multivariable logistic regressions evaluated the associations of having coverage disruptions or being uninsured with care access, receipt, and affordability. RESULTS Overall, 5.0% of currently insured adults with private and 10.7% with public insurance reported a coverage disruption in the previous year, representing nearly 9.1 million adults in 2018. Among currently uninsured, 24.9% reported coverage loss within the previous year, representing nearly 8.1 million adults in 2018. Among adults with current private or current public coverage, disruptions were associated with lower receipt of all preventive services (AOR=0.42, 95% CI=0.37, 0.46 and AOR=0.48, 95% CI=0.40, 0.58, respectively), with forgoing any needed care because of cost (AOR=4.79, 95% CI=4.44, 5.17 and AOR=4.28, 95% CI=3.86, 4.75), and with medication nonadherence because of cost (AOR=3.55, 95% CI=3.13, 4.03 and AOR=4.09, 95% CI=3.43, 4.88) compared with that among adults with continuous coverage (p<0.05). Longer disruptions among currently insured adults were significantly associated with worse care access, receipt, and affordability, with dose-response patterns. Currently uninsured adults, especially those with longer uninsured periods, reported significantly worse care access, receipt, and affordability than currently insured adults with coverage disruptions or continuous coverage. CONCLUSIONS Findings highlight the importance of continuous insurance coverage; disruptions owing to the COVID-19 pandemic will likely have adverse consequences for care access and affordability.","Yabroff, K Robin; Zhao, Jingxuan; Halpern, Michael T; Fedewa, Stacey A; Han, Xuesong; Nogueira, Leticia M; Zheng, Zhiyuan; Jemal, Ahmedin",American journal of preventive medicine,221,16

METHODS This patient- and assessor-blinded randomized three-centre clinical trial compared SLC and MLC in women admitted electively with cholecystolithiasis. Outcomes were registered on the day of operation (day 0), on postoperative days 1, 2, 3 and 30, and 12 months after surgery. Blinding of the patients was maintained until day 3. The primary endpoint was pain on movement measured on a visual analogue scale, reported repeatedly by the patient until day 3. RESULTS The intention-to-treat population comprised 59 patients in the SLC and 58 in the MLC group. There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to any of the pain-related outcomes, on-demand administration of opioids or general discomfort. Median duration of surgery was 32·5 min longer in the SLC group (P < 0·001). SLC was associated with a reduced incidence of vomiting on day 0 (7 versus 22 per cent; P = 0·019). The incidences of wound-related problems were comparable. One patient in the SLC group experienced a biliary leak requiring endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The rates of incisional hernia at 12-month follow-up were 2 per cent in both groups. Cosmetic rating was significantly improved after SLC at 1 and 12 months (P < 0·001).

The aim of this study was to present our clinical experience of consecutive series with use of uncovered self-expanding stent (SES) as ""Open Chimney"" (OCh) in the endovascular repair (EVAR) of JRAA. METHODS A standard endograft with suprarenal fixation struts is delivered with its proximal covered edge just below the highest RA in JRAA presenting the ostium of the two renal arteries at a different aortic level and the distance between the highest renal artery and the beginning of the aneurysm (improved landing zone) ≥10 mm. The low-lying renal artery is maintained patent by the OCh graft (standard SES) delivered from left brachial access (6 Fr). All clinical, anatomical, and operative data were prospectively collected and retrieved for the study analysis. RESULTS From July 2010 to November 2012, OCh EVAR was offered to 22 consecutive patients considered unfit for JRAA open repair. All procedures were technically successful with aneurysm exclusion and patent OCh graft. One small perioperative type Ia endoleak spontaneously disappeared at the 3-month CT control. One patient died because of acute decompensated heart failure. One patient presented a left hemispheric stroke. The median follow-up of 18 months (range 7-35) showed aneurysm exclusion in all patients without type I and III endoleaks, SES stenosis, and/or renal impairment.

This guideline document presents the European Stroke Organisation guidelines for the prophylaxis of VTE in immobile patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Guidelines for haemorrhagic stroke have already been published. Methods A multidisciplinary group identified related questions and developed its recommendations based on evidence from randomised controlled trials using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. This guideline document was reviewed within the European Stroke Organisation and externally and was approved by the European Stroke Organisation Guidelines Committee and the European Stroke Organisation Executive Committee. Results We found mainly moderate quality evidence comprising randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews evaluating graduated compression stockings (GCS), intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) and prophylactic anticoagulation with unfractionated (UFH) and low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) and heparinoids, but no randomised trials evaluating neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NES). We recommend that clinicians should use IPC in immobile patients, but that they should not use GCS. Prophylactic anticoagulation with UFH (5000U ×2, or ×3 daily) or LMWH or heparinoid should be considered in immobile patients with ischaemic stroke in whom the benefits of reducing the risk of VTE is high enough to offset the increased risks of intracranial and extracranial bleeding associated with their use. Where a judgement has been made that prophylactic anticoagulation is indicated LMWH or heparinoid should be considered instead of UFH because of its greater reduction in risk of DVT, the greater convenience, reduced staff costs and patient comfort associated single vs. multiple daily injections but these advantages should be weighed against the higher risk of extracranial bleeding, higher drug costs and risks in elderly patients with poor renal function associated with LMWH and heparinoids. Conclusions IPC, UFH or LMWH and heparinoids can reduce the risk of VTE in immobile patients with acute ischaemic stroke but further research is required to test whether NES is effective. The strongest evidence is for IPC. Better methods are needed to help stratify patients in the first few weeks after stroke onset, by their risk of VTE and their risk of bleeding on anticoagulants.","Dennis, Martin; Caso, Valeria; Kappelle, L Jaap; Pavlovic, Aleksandra; Sandercock, Peter",European stroke journal,221,8

Many commercial kits for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnostics have played a crucial role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Most current standard in vitro diagnostic (IVD) protocols for infectious diseases are sensitive but time-consuming and require sophisticated laboratory equipment and specially trained personnel. Recent advances in biosensor technology suggest the potential to deliver point-of-care (POC) diagnostics that are affordable and provide accurate results in a short time. The ideal ""sample-in-answer-out"" type fully integrated POC infection diagnostic platforms are expected to be autonomous or easy-to-operate, equipment-free or infrastructure-independent, and high-throughput or easy to upscale.In this Account, we detail the recent progress made by our group and others in the development of centrifugal microfluidic devices or lab-on-a-disc (LOAD) systems. Unlike conventional pump-based fluid actuation, the centrifugal force generated by spinning the disc induces liquid pumping and no external fluidic interconnects are required. This allows a total fluidic network required for multiple steps of biological assays to be integrated on a disc, enabling fully automated POC diagnostics. Various applications have been demonstrated, including liquid biopsy for personalized cancer management, food applications, and environmental monitoring; here, we focus on IVD for infectious disease. First, we introduce various on-disc unit operation technologies, including reagent storage, sedimentation, filtration, valving, decanting, aliquoting, mixing, separation, serial dilution, washing, and calibration. Such centrifugal microfluidic technologies have already proved promising for micro-total-analysis systems for automated IVD ranging from molecular detection of pathogens to multiplexed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) that use raw samples such as whole blood or saliva. Some recent examples of LOAD systems for molecular diagnostics in which some or all steps of the assays are integrated on a disc, including pathogen enrichment, nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and detection, are discussed in detail. We then introduce fully automated ELISA systems with enhanced sensitivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate a toy-inspired fidget spinner that enables electricity-free and rapid analysis of pathogens from undiluted urine samples of patients with urinary tract infection symptoms and a phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility test for an extreme POC diagnostics application.Considering the urgent need for cost-effective and reliable POC infection diagnostic tools, especially in the current pandemic crisis, the current limitations and future directions of fast and broad adaptation in real-world settings are also discussed. With proper attention to key challenges and leverage with recent advances in biosensing technologies, molecular biology, nanomaterials, analytical chemistry, miniaturization, system integration, and data management, LOAD systems hold the potential to deliver POC infection diagnostic tools with unprecedented performance regarding time, accuracy, and cost. We hope the new insight and promise of LOAD systems for POC infection diagnostics presented in this Account can spark new ideas and inspire further research and development to create better healthcare systems for current and future pandemics.","Sunkara, Vijaya; Kumar, Sumit; Sabaté Del Río, Jonathan; Kim, Insu; Cho, Yoon-Kyoung",Accounts of chemical research,221,20

However, the direct contact of visceral organs with mesh material is a major issue. PATIENTS AND METHODS This prospective observational study presents the data of 344 patients treated for incisional and parastomal hernias with a new mesh made of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF; Dynamesh IPOM) between May 2004 and January 2008 with a minimum follow-up of 6 months. The median follow-up of 297 patients after incisional hernias totaled 24 months and 20 months for 47 patients with parastomal hernias. Incisional hernias were repaired using an IPOM technique. For parastomal hernias, a recently described sandwich technique was used with two meshes implanted in an intraperitoneal onlay position. RESULTS The recurrence rate for incisional hernias was 2/297 = 0.6% and 1/47 = 2% for parastomal hernias. Three patients developed a secondary infection after surgical revision or puncture of a seroma. One patient had a bowel fistula through the mesh, with an abscess in the hernia sac. In all cases, the infection healed and the mesh could be preserved. No long-term mesh-related complications have been observed. CONCLUSION The laparoscopic repair of incisional and parastomal hernias with meshes made of PVDF (Dynamesh IPOM) revealed low recurrence and, overall, low complication rates. Especially in cases of infection, the material proved to be resistant without clinical signs of persistent bacterial contamination.

An important pathogen life history characteristic is the propensity to induce an asymptomatic yet productive (transmissive) stage at the beginning of an infection. This characteristic is subject to complex trade-offs, ranging from immunological considerations to population-level social processes. We aim to classify the evolutionary dynamics of such asymptomatic behavior of pathogens (hereafter ""latency"") in order to unify epidemiology and evolution for this life history strategy. We focus on a simple epidemiological model with two infectious stages, where hosts in the first stage can be partially or fully asymptomatic. Immunologically, there is a trade-off between transmission and progression in this first stage. For arbitrary trade-offs, we derive different conditions that guarantee either at least one evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) at zero, some, or maximal latency of the first stage or, perhaps surprisingly, at least one unstable evolutionarily singular strategy. In this latter case, there is bistability between zero and nonzero (possibly maximal) latency. We then prove the uniqueness of interior evolutionarily singular strategies for power-law and exponential trade-offs: Thus, bistability is always between zero and maximal latency. Overall, previous multistage infection models can be summarized with a single model that includes evolutionary processes acting on latency. Since small changes in parameter values can lead to abrupt transitions in evolutionary dynamics, appropriate disease control strategies could have a substantial impact on the evolution of first-stage latency.","Saad-Roy, Chadi M; Wingreen, Ned S; Levin, Simon A; Grenfell, Bryan T",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,221,1

In 2005, the United States, along with other Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO), adopted the revised International Health Regulations [IHR (2005)]. The IHR (2005) conferred new responsibilities on WHO and the global health community to coordinate resources for capacity building and emergency response, and on the now-196 States Parties to develop the core capacities required to detect, assess, report, and respond to potential public health emergencies of international concern. Both GHSA and the IHR aim to elevate political attention and encourage participation, coordination, and collaboration by multiple stakeholders, while leveraging previously existing commitments and multilateral efforts. GHSA and the IHR (2005) are platforms for action; how efforts under each will complement each other remains unclear. Mechanisms that measure progress under these 2 overlapping frameworks will aid in focusing resources and in sustaining political momentum for IHR implementation after 2016.","Katz, Rebecca; Sorrell, Erin M; Kornblet, Sarah A; Fischer, Julie E","Biosecurity and bioterrorism : biodefense strategy, practice, and science",221,16

Our aim was to evaluate the risk of VTE in individuals with severe AATD compared with control subjects from the general population. METHODS Individuals with severe AATD (n=1577) were recruited from the Swedish national AATD register. Control subjects (n=5969) were selected from the OLIN (Obstructive lung disease in Northern Sweden) studies, that include a random general population sample. Longitudinal data on VTE and diagnoses were obtained from the Swedish National Patient Registry. Associations were analyzed using multivariable Cox regression. RESULTS At inclusion, 46% of the AATD individuals and 53% of the controls were never-smokers. COPD was present in 46% of the AATD individuals compared with 4% of the controls. During a median follow-up of 18 years, 116 (7%) of the AATD individuals and 89 (1%) of the control subjects developed VTE, unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) 6.5 (95% CI, 4.9-8.6). Risk factors for incident VTE were male gender, age, COPD, cancer and liver disease. Adjusting for these factors, the AATD individuals had a significantly higher risk of incident VTE, adjusted HR 4.2 (95% CI 2.9-6.2) as compared with the controls. CONCLUSION Subjects with severe AATD have considerably increased risk of developing VTE compared with the general population, even after accounting for risk factors. This calls for optimized risk factor management and clinical follow-up of this patient group.","Basil, Nawfal; Ekström, Magnus; Piitulainen, Eeva; Lindberg, Anne; Rönmark, Eva; Jehpsson, Lars; Tanash, Hanan",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,221,19

Screening is recommended after the eruption of the first tooth, but it is unclear how the age at first dental examination is associated with eventual restorative treatment needs. The authors of this study sought to determine how provider type and age at first dental examination are associated longitudinally with caries experience among children in the United States. METHODS Deidentified claims data were included for 706,636 privately insured children aged 0 through 6 years as part of the nationwide IBM Watson Health Market Scan (2012-2017). The authors used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to describe the association between the age of first visit and restorative treatment needs. RESULTS A total of 21% of this population required restorative treatment, and the average age at first dental examination was 3.6 years. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model showed increased hazard for restorative treatment with age at first dental visit at 3 years (hazard ratio, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.97 to 2.13) and 4 years (hazard ratio, 3.99; 95% CI, 3.84 to 4.16). CONCLUSION The high proportion of children requiring restorative treatment and late age at first dental screening show needed investments in educating general dentists, medical students, and pediatricians about oral health guidelines for pediatric patients. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Communicating the importance of children establishing a dental home by age 1 year to parents and health care professionals may help reduce disease burden in children younger than 6 years.","McGivern, Sean; Ahmed, Imran; Beymer, Matthew R; Okunev, Ilya; Tranby, Eric P; Frantsve-Hawley, Julie; Ramos-Gomez, Francisco",Journal of the American Dental Association,221,17

Whole DNA was extracted from the roots of maize plants cultivated with organic fertilizer, inorganic fertilizer and maize planted without any fertilizer at different planting sites in an experimental field and sequenced using shotgun metagenomics. Our results using the Subsystem database revealed a total of 28 phyla and different nutrient pathways in all the samples. The major phyla observed were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Verrucomicrobia, Tenericutes, Planctomycetes, Cyanobacteria, and Chlorobi. Bacteroidetes dominated maize from organic fertilizer sites, Firmicutes dominated the no fertilizers site while Proteobacteria dominated Inorganic fertilizer. The diversity analysis showed that the abundance of endophytic bacteria in all the sites is in the order organic fertilizer (FK) > no fertilizer (CK) > inorganic fertilizer (NK). Furthermore, the major nutrient cycling pathways identified are linked with nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism which were higher in FK samples. Going by the results obtained, this study suggests that organic fertilizer could be a boost to sustainable agricultural practices and should be encouraged. Also, a lot of novel endophytic bacteria groups were identified in maize. Mapping out strategies to isolate and purify this novel endophytic bacteria could help in promoting sustainable agriculture alongside biotechnological applications in future.","Fadiji, Ayomide Emmanuel; Ayangbenro, Ayansina Segun; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti",Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,221,23

METHODS We performed a retrospective multicenter study of infants aged 2 to 7 days hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia from December 1, 2016, to June 30, 2018, using the Pediatric Health Information System. Hospital-level variation in laboratory and IVF use was evaluated after adjusting for clinical and demographic factors and associated with hospital-level outcomes by using Pearson correlation. RESULTS We identified 4396 infants hospitalized with hyperbilirubinemia. In addition to bilirubin level, the most frequently ordered laboratories were direct antiglobulin testing (45.7%), reticulocyte count (39.7%), complete blood cell counts (43.7%), ABO blood type (33.4%), and electrolyte panels (12.9%). IVFs were given to 26.3% of children. Extensive variation in laboratory testing and IVF administration was observed across hospitals (all P < .001). Increased use of laboratory testing but not IVFs was associated with a longer length of stay (P = .007 and .162, respectively). Neither supplementary laboratory use nor IVF use was associated with either readmissions or emergency department revisits. CONCLUSIONS Substantial variation exists among hospitals in the management of infants with hyperbilirubinemia. With our results, we suggest that additional testing outside of bilirubin measurement may unnecessarily increase resource use for infants hospitalized with hyperbilirubinemia.","DePorre, Adrienne G; Hall, Matthew; Puls, Henry T; Daly, Ashley; Gay, James C; Bettenhausen, Jessica L; Markham, Jessica L",Hospital pediatrics,221,16

Reliable and reproducible animal models of RV failure are therefore warranted in order to investigate disease mechanisms and effects of potential therapeutic strategies. Banding of the pulmonary trunk is a common method to induce isolated RV hypertrophy but in general, previously described models have not succeeded in creating a stable model of RV hypertrophy and failure. We present a rat model of pressure overload induced RV hypertrophy caused by pulmonary trunk banding (PTB) that enables different phenotypes of RV hypertrophy with and without RV failure. We use a modified ligating clip applier to compress a titanium clip around the pulmonary trunk to a pre-set inner diameter. We use different clip diameters to induce different stages of disease progression from mild RV hypertrophy to decompensated RV failure. RV hypertrophy develops consistently in rats subjected to the PTB procedure and depending on the diameter of the applied banding clip, we can accurately reproduce different disease severities ranging from compensated hypertrophy to severe decompensated RV failure with extra-cardiac manifestations. The presented PTB model is a valid and robust model of pressure overload induced RV hypertrophy and failure that has several advantages to other banding models including high reproducibility and the possibility of inducing severe and decompensated RV failure.","Andersen, Stine; Schultz, Jacob Gammelgaard; Holmboe, Sarah; Axelsen, Julie Birkmose; Hansen, Mona Sahlholdt; Lyhne, Mads Dam; Nielsen-Kudsk, Jens Erik; Andersen, Asger",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,221,1

Evidence of the γδ TCR/ligand recognition modalities that respective human subsets utilize is accumulating. Although many questions remain unanswered, one superantigen-like modality features interactions of germline-encoded regions of particular TCR Vγ regions with specific BTN/BTNL family members and apparently aligns with an innate-like biology, albeit with some scope for clonal amplification. A second involves CDR3-mediated γδ TCR interaction with diverse ligands and aligns with an adaptive-like biology. Importantly, these unconventional modalities provide γδ T cells with unique recognition capabilities relative to αβ T cells, B cells, and NK cells, allowing immunosurveillance for signatures of ""altered self"" on target cells, via a membrane-linked γδ TCR recognizing intact non-MHC proteins on the opposing cell surface. In doing so, they permit cellular responses in diverse situations including where MHC expression is compromised, or where conventional adaptive and/or NK cell-mediated immunity is suppressed. γδ T cells may therefore utilize their TCR like a cell-surface Fab repertoire, somewhat analogous to engineered chimeric antigen receptor T cells, but additionally integrating TCR signaling with parallel signals from other surface immunoreceptors, making them multimolecular sensors of cellular stress.","Willcox, Carrie R; Mohammed, Fiyaz; Willcox, Benjamin E",Immunological reviews,221,5

However, the effects of their size, charge, and lipid compositions on macrophage and foam cell behaviour are not fully understood. In this study, liposomes of different sizes (60 nm, 100 nm and 180 nm), charges (-40 mV, -20 mV, neutral, +15 mV and +30 mV) and lipid compositions (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, L-a-phosphatidylcholine, and egg sphingomyelin) were synthesized, characterized and exposed to macrophages and foam cells. Compared to 100 nm neutral 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposomes, flow cytometry and imaging analysis indicated that cationic liposomes and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) liposomes were internalized more by both macrophages and foam cells. Through endocytosis inhibition, phagocytosis and clathrin-mediated endocytosis were identified as the dominant mechanisms of uptake. Anionic and DSPC liposomes induced more cholesterol efflux capacity in foam cells. These results provide a guide on the optimal size, charge, and lipid composition of liposomes as drug carriers for atherosclerosis treatment.","Tang, Jinkai; Rakshit, Moumita; Chua, Huei Min; Darwitan, Anastasia; Nguyen, Luong T H; Muktabar, Aristo; Venkatraman, Subbu; Ng, Kee Woei",Nanotechnology,221,1

DESIGN We conducted a literature review of injury prevention and data science in April 2020 and January 2021 in three databases. METHODS For the included 99 articles, we extracted the following: (1) author(s) and year; (2) title; (3) study approach (4) reason for applying data science method; (5) data science method type; (6) study description; (7) data source and (8) focus on a disproportionately affected population. RESULTS Results showed the literature on data science and suicide more than doubled from 2019 to 2020, with articles with individual-level approaches more prevalent than population-level approaches. Most population-level articles applied data science methods to describe (n=10) outcomes, while most individual-level articles identified risk factors (n=27). Machine learning was the most common data science method applied in the studies (n=48). A wide array of data sources was used for suicide research, with most articles (n=45) using social media and web-based behaviour data. Eleven studies demonstrated the value of applying data science to suicide prevention literature for disproportionately affected groups. CONCLUSION Data science techniques proved to be effective tools in describing suicidal thoughts or behaviour, identifying individual risk factors and predicting outcomes.

Chinese authorities and health agencies had devoted great efforts to control this disease. As surgeons specialized in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors, we should always be aware of the prevention for NCP and incorporate this awareness into every detail of clinical practice. For the patients with gastrointestinal tumors, pre-admission screening should be done in order to rule out NCP. Real-time RT-PCR panel and chest CT scan should be conducted for patients with fever (>37.3℃), travel history to Hubei Province within 14 days, or contact history with residents from Wuhan district within 14 days. Prevention measures for both medical staffs and the screen-negative admitted patients should also be enhanced because false negative is possible. Medical instruments should be properly discarded or disinfected according to standardized procedures established by the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC). Surgical operation should be reduced at a minimal level to prevent cross infection in this special period.Surgical intervention for benign tumor should be postponed. For malignant tumor, multidisciplinary therapy (MDT) is recommended and non-surgical anti-tumor therapy should be selected with higher priority. Neoadjuvant therapy is highly recommended for gastrointestinal cancer at advanced stages that meet the indications of NCCN guideline (gastric cancer T stage ≥ 2/rectal cancer T stage ≥ 3/unresectable colon cancer). Gastric or esophagogastricjunction (EGJ) malignant tumor with obstruction can be managed with gastric tube decompression or stent placement to relieve the symptoms. Transnasal enteral feeding tube intubation/percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy could be adopted to ensure enteral nutrition supply. For colorectal malignancy with simple intestinal obstruction, stent placement can achieve a high success rate, which not only helps avoid emergency surgery, but also creates a better condition for subsequent surgery. Transcatheter arterial embolization for hemostasis is an alternative choice for gastrointestinal tumor with bleeding. However, emergency operation still must be performed for patients with acute uncontrolled bleeding, obstruction or after other alternative treatment measures fail. All cases with suspicious or confirmed with NCP must be reported to the local CDC department. All invasive intervention must be performed in a designated isolation area. Tertiary prevention measure must be adopted for all anesthetists with additional face mask or medical goggle protection to prevent respiratory droplet transmission. Preventive enterostomy is preferable in lower digestive tract surgery. Thoroughly disinfecting the operating room after surgery is necessary. Fever after surgery must be carefully differentiated whether it's caused by post-surgery abdominal infection/inflammation or NCP. Single-room isolation and related examinations should be performed according to the standard procedures. We believe that with the unprecedentedly joint efforts of doctors and patients, we will eventually win this war against NCP.","Chen, Y H; Peng, J S",Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery,221,20

We set out to investigate whether participants in Virus Watch-a large community cohort study based in England and Wales-reported differential exposure to public activities and non-household contacts during the autumn-winter phase of the COVID-19 pandemic according to postcode-level socioeconomic deprivation. METHODS Participants (n=20 120-25 228 across surveys) reported their daily activities during 3 weekly periods in late November 2020, late December 2020 and mid-February 2021. Deprivation was quantified based on participants' residential postcode using English or Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles. We used Poisson mixed-effect models with robust standard errors to estimate the relationship between deprivation and risk of exposure to public activities during each survey period. RESULTS Relative to participants in the least deprived areas, participants in the most deprived areas exhibited elevated risk of exposure to vehicle sharing (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) range across time points: 1.73-8.52), public transport (aRR: 3.13-5.73), work or education outside of the household (aRR: 1.09-1.21), essential shops (aRR: 1.09-1.13) and non-household contacts (aRR: 1.15-1.19) across multiple survey periods. CONCLUSION Differential exposure to essential public activities-such as attending workplaces and visiting essential shops-is likely to contribute to inequalities in infection risk and outcomes. Public health interventions to reduce exposure during essential activities and financial and practical support to enable low-paid workers to stay at home during periods of intense transmission may reduce COVID-related inequalities.","Beale, Sarah; Braithwaite, Isobel; Navaratnam, Annalan Md; Hardelid, Pia; Rodger, Alison; Aryee, Anna; Byrne, Thomas E; Fong, Erica Wing Lam; Fragaszy, Ellen; Geismar, Cyril; Kovar, Jana; Nguyen, Vincent; Patel, Parth; Shrotri, Madhumita; Aldridge, Robert; Hayward, Andrew",Journal of epidemiology and community health,221,19

We report herein that sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2), a key enzyme in sphingolipid catabolism, plays a critical role in the regulation of hepatic insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis both in vitro and in vivo. Hepatocyte-specific Sphk2 knockout mice exhibit pronounced insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Likewise, SphK2-deficient hepatocytes are resistant to insulin-induced activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-FoxO1 pathway and elevated hepatic glucose production. Mechanistically, SphK2 deficiency leads to the accumulation of sphingosine that, in turn, suppresses hepatic insulin signaling by inhibiting PI3K activation in hepatocytes.

Relatively well described concept but without defined position in clincal practise. AIM To report of institutional experience with laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) nephrectomy (NE) and compare (matched case-control study) it with that of standard laparoscopic NE (LNE). MATERIAL AND METHODS In the period 8/2011 to 10/2013, we performed 183 mini-invasive NE (132 tumours, 51 benign aetiology); 45 of them (24.6%) were LESS, the rest LNE. The main but not absolute indications for LESS were: non-obese men, and less advanced tumours. In 13 patients undergoing LESS-NEs (28.9%) there was a transumbilical approach. For the rest, a pararectal incision was performed and an accessory port was added in 31.1% (14) - 2/22 (9.1%) left sided, 12/23 (52.2%) right sided. Twenty-four LESS-NE were performed by a more experienced surgeon (mean operation time (MOT) 73.1 min), 21 LESS-NE by 4 other surgeons (MOT 132.8 min). These 24 were compared with 43 LNE done by the same surgeon before the period of LESS (1/2007-8/2011) and with similar characteristics of cases (body mass index (BMI) ≤ 35 kg/m(2), less advanced tumour). RESULTS We found no statistically significant differences in any of the parameters studied. The MOT 73.1 min vs. 75.0 min (p = 0.78), BMI 27.4 kg/m(2) vs. 29.2 kg/m(2) (p = 0.08), blood loss 54.7 vs. 39.2 (p = 0.47). Complications (4.2% vs. 11.6%) were only of internal character in origin. No conversion in either group. In LESS-NE, staplers were used more frequently (more expensive than clips) for division of renal hilar vessels (70.8% vs. 51.2%). The mean price of LESS-NE was €367 higher. CONCLUSIONS The LESS NE performed by an experienced surgeon is a safe and efficient method for the surgical treatment of both malignant and benign renal conditions in patients with BMI < 30 kg/m(2) and with low-stage tumours. The LESS NE is more expensive compared to LNE.","Hora, Milan; Eret, Viktor; Stránský, Petr; Trávníček, Ivan; Urge, Tomáš; Ferda, Jiří; Petersson, Fredrik; Hes, Ondřej",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,221,9

However, these effects are constrained by their limited ability to migrate to the injured site. Oncostatin M (OSM) has been shown to affect the proliferation and migration of mesenchymal stem cells. Therefore, in the present study, we explored whether OSM improves BMSC migration and secretion of growth factors and cytokines in a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) stroke model. The effect of OSM on the proliferation and apoptosis of rat BMSCs was first assessed in vitro, and the gene and secretion levels of factors related to cell nutrition and migration, such as SDF-1 and VEGF, were detected. To further explore underlying pathways triggered by OSM, BMSCs were treated with OSM in the presence or absence of inhibitors of the STAT3 and ERK pathways. Effects of OSM on SDF-1 expression in astrocytes and BMSC migration were also evaluated. In the rat MCAO model, OSM secretion levels were detected in the brain for up to 72 h after model establishment. Ventricle injection of OSM alone or OSM combined with caudal vein graft of BMSCs was then performed in MCAO stroke rats. After 72 h, production of SDF-1 and grafted BMSCs was detected in the lesion areas of the brain, and the nerve function score was evaluated. We found that the production of OSM continually increased in the brains of MCAO rats from 12 h to 72 h. OSM significantly upregulated SDF-1 in BMSCs via the STAT3 and ERK pathways and significantly promoted the expression of VEGF and MMP-2. OSM also promoted the secretion of SDF-1 in astrocytes through the STAT3 and ERK pathways to in turn enhance BMSC migration. Combination treatment with OSM and BMSCs in MCAO rats increased the migration efficiency of BMSCs in the brain, which significantly improved neurofunctional recovery while reducing the expression of inflammatory mediators and promoting the secretion of nutrition factors. Overall, these results show that OSM is highly expressed in the brains of MCAO stroke rats and can upregulate SDF-1 to promote BMSC migration. Thus, combination treatment with OSM and BMSCs improves the graft efficiency of BMSCs and neurofunctional recovery.","Han, Jianbang; Feng, Zhiming; Xie, Yu; Li, Feng; Lv, Bingke; Hua, Tian; Zhang, Zhongfei; Sun, Chengmei; Su, Dazhuang; Ouyang, Qian; Cai, Yingqian; Zou, Yuxi; Tang, Yanping; Sun, Haitao; Jiang, Xiaodan",Experimental neurology,221,16

A Case Study.,13.630427,3.3004704,2020,"Preclinical studies suggest that gallbladder emptying, via bile acid-induced activation of the G protein-coupled receptor TGR5 in intestinal L cells, may play a significant role in the secretion of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and, hence, postprandial glucose homeostasis. We examined the secretion of gut hormones in cholecystectomized subjects to test the hypothesis that gallbladder emptying potentiates postprandial release of GLP-1. Ten cholecystectomized subjects and 10 healthy, age-, gender-, and body mass index-matched control subjects received a standardized fat-rich liquid meal (2,200 kJ). Basal and postprandial plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GLP-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), cholecystokinin (CCK), and gastrin were measured. Furthermore, gastric emptying and duodenal and serum bile acids were measured. We found similar basal glucose concentrations in the two groups, whereas cholecystectomized subjects had elevated postprandial glucose excursions. Cholecystectomized subjects had reduced postprandial concentrations of duodenal bile acids, but preserved postprandial plasma GLP-1 responses, compared with control subjects. Also, cholecystectomized patients exhibited augmented fasting glucagon. Basal plasma CCK concentrations were lower and peak concentrations were higher in cholecystectomized patients. The concentrations of GIP, GLP-2, and gastrin were similar in the two groups. In conclusion, cholecystectomized subjects had preserved postprandial GLP-1 responses in spite of decreased duodenal bile delivery, suggesting that gallbladder emptying is not a prerequisite for GLP-1 release. Cholecystectomized patients demonstrated a slight deterioration of postprandial glycemic control, probably because of metabolic changes unrelated to incretin secretion.","Sonne, David P; Hare, Kristine J; Martens, Pernille; Rehfeld, Jens F; Holst, Jens J; Vilsbøll, Tina; Knop, Filip K",American journal of physiology.

Immunizations are not required, leaving refugees at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. In response, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of State developed and co-funded a global immunization program for US-bound refugees, implemented in 2012 in collaboration with the International Organization for Migration. METHODS We describe the Vaccination Program for US-bound Refugees, including vaccination schedule development, program implementation and procedures, and responses to challenges. We estimate 2019 immunization coverage rates using the number of age-eligible refugees who received ≥1 dose of measles-containing vaccine during overseas health assessment, and calculated hepatitis B infection prevalence using hepatitis B surface antigen testing results. We report descriptive data on adverse events following immunization. RESULTS By September 2019, the program was active in >80 countries on five continents. Nearly 320,000 examined refugees had ≥1 documented vaccine doses since program inception. During federal fiscal year 2019, 95% of arriving refugees had ≥1 documented measles-containing vaccine. The program's immunization schedule included eleven vaccines preventing fourteen diseases. In 2015-2019, only two vaccine preventable disease-associated refugee group travel cancellations occurred, compared to 2-8 cancellations annually prior to program initiation. To maintain uniform standards, dedicated staff and program-specific protocols for vaccination and monitoring were introduced. CONCLUSIONS An overseas immunization program was successfully implemented for US-bound refugees. Due to reductions in refugee movement cancellation, lower cost of immunization overseas, and likely reductions in vaccine preventable disease-associated morbidity, we anticipate significant cost savings. Although maintaining uniform standards across diverse settings is challenging, solutions such as introduction of dedicated staff, protocol development, and ongoing technical support have ensured program cohesion, continuity, and advancement. Lessons learned can benefit similar programs implemented in the migration setting.","Mitchell, Tarissa; Dalal, Warren; Klosovsky, Alexander; Yen, Catherine; Phares, Christina; Burkhardt, Margaret; Amin, Farah; Froes, Ivan; Hamadeh, Amira; Lynn, Sai Aung; Quintanilla, Judith; Doney, Annelise Casano; Cetron, Martin; Weinberg, Michelle",Vaccine,221,1

Previous evidence focused predominantly on infants from the intensive care unit (ICU). This study sought to examine the diagnostic and clinical utility, and the economic impact on clinical management of rWES in patients beyond infancy and ICU setting. Methods rWES was performed on a prospective cohort of patients with suspected monogenic disorder referred from territory-wide paediatric ICUs and non-ICUs in Hong Kong urging for rapid genetic diagnosis. All eligible families were invited. We aimed to achieve a rapid turnaround time (TAT) of 14 days. Clinical utility and costs associated with clinical management were assessed in diagnosed cases. Actual quantitative changes in healthcare utilisation were compared with a counterfactual diagnostic trajectory and/or with matched historical control whenever possible. Findings rWES were offered to 102 families and 32/102 (31%) patients received a molecular diagnosis, with a median TAT of 11 days. Clinical management changed in 28 of 32 diagnosed patients (88%), including but not limited to modifications in treatment, avoidance of surgeries, and informing decisions on redirection of care. Cost analysis was performed in eight patients. rWES was estimated to reduce hospital length of stay by 566 days and decrease healthcare costs by HKD$8,044,250 (GBP£796,460) for these eight patients. The net cost-savings after inclusion of rWES costs were estimated to be HKD$5,325,187 (GBP£527,246). Interpretation This study replicates the diagnostic capacity and rapid TAT of rWES in predominantly Chinese patients, and demonstrates diagnosis-predicated precision medicine and net healthcare savings. Findings were corroborated by evidence from multinational cohorts, combined as part of a meta-analysis. rWES merits consideration as a first-tier diagnostic tool for patients with urgent needs in the clinical setting.

The pandemic therefore accelerated adjustments in lymphoedema service delivery, while ensuring effective and efficient care was paramount. This document presents a pragmatic guide for lymphoedema services. Although clinical and non-clinical staff need to comply with guidance from their own organisations/commissioners, this document aims to provide specific guidance and share good practice in relation to lymphoedema management. These guidelines are based on analysis of the national response of Lymphoedema Network Wales during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic and incorporate supporting contemporary advice. They have been used throughout NHS Wales, providing a standardised approach in supporting care for people with lymphoedema. In light of the enduring nature of COVID-19, it is imperative that lymphoedema services have a means to provide suitable care for patients. Although face-to-face appointments are sometimes deemed necessary, many patients can be suitably supported via telehealth consultations. These guidelines may help lymphoedema services restore and reset in a safe and acceptable manner.","Noble-Jones, Rhian; Thomas, Melanie J; Lawrence, Paula; Pike, Cheryl",British journal of nursing,221,1

This study was undertaken to evaluate physiological and morphological changes after LVR for RAI, and to study clinical outcomes following LVR with special reference to fecal incontinence (FI). METHODS The study was conducted on patients who had LVR for RAI between February 2012 and December 2016 at our institution Patients with RAI and FI were included in the study. Patients with RAI and obstructed defecation and those with RAI and neurologic FI were not included. The patients had anorectal manometry preoperatively, and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Defecography was performed before and 6 months after the procedure. FI was evaluated using the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI). RESULTS There were 34 patients (median age 77 years (range 60-93) years). Thirty-two patients (94%) were female and the median number of vaginal deliveries was 2 (range 0-5). Neither maximum resting pressure nor maximum squeeze pressure increased postoperatively. There was an overall increase in both defecatory desire volume (median preoperative 75 ml vs. 90 ml at 12 months; p = 0.002) and maximum tolerated volume (median preoperative 145 ml vs.175 ml at 12 months; p = 0.002). Postoperatively, RAI was eliminated in all patients but one, although 13 had residual rectorectal intussusception found at defecography. There was an overall reduction in both rectocele size (median preop 29 mm vs. postop 10 mm; p = 0.008) and pelvic floor descent (median preop 26 mm vs. postop 20 mm; p = 0.005). Twelve months after surgery, a reduction of at least 50% was observed in the FISI score for 31 incontinent patients (91%). CONCLUSIONS LVR for RAI produced adequate improvement of FI, and successful anatomical correction of RAI was confirmed by postoperative proctography. Postoperative increase in the rectal volume may have a positive effect on continence.","Tsunoda, A; Takahashi, T; Hayashi, K; Yagi, Y; Kusanagi, H",Techniques in coloproctology,221,23

Pharmacotherapy is one of the most common strategies to reduce neck pain in patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the real-world pattern of drugs prescribed for patients with neck pain in the USA. METHODS Data on individuals who reported current neck pain in the 2009-2010 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and with a history of persistent pain for at least 6 weeks or 3 months were extracted from the NHANES database. Those included in the study were divided into three groups based on the duration of pain: the without neck pain group (Group A); subacute group (Group B) with a history of 6 weeks of neck pain; and the chronic neck pain group (Group C) with a history of 3 months of neck pain. The use and duration of medication prescribed for Group A, B, and C patients were compared. RESULTS The analysis revealed that opioid use was significantly more prevalent in the subacute and chronic neck pain group than in the without neck pain group (Group A) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.07-8.52 and aOR 7.00, 95% CI 4.32-11.33, respectively). The factors strongly associated with higher opioid use included older age, low education level, and low family income. In the chronic neck group, opioids, followed in decreasing order of frequency by acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-infammatory drugs, were the most common analgesics used in combination with other analgesics. CONCLUSION Our analysis of the data shows that the long-term excessive use of opioids and the underutilization of other analgesics are two major issues in the treatment of neck pain in the USA. Possible improvements include improved education of patients by healthcare professionals on the use of opioids and more consideration given to non-pharmacotherapy options. Our results reveal the potential problem in pharmacotherapy choices for neck pain treatment and may help improve the current clinical practice in the USA and other countries.","Huang, Jin-Feng; Meng, Zhou; Zheng, Xuan-Qi; Qin, Zongshi; Sun, Xiao-Lei; Zhang, Kai; Tian, Hai-Jun; Wang, Xiao-Bing; Gao, Ze; Li, Yan Michael; Wu, Ai-Min",Pain and therapy,221,27

This study aimed to analyse the impact of complications on survival in a Western cohort. METHODS Complications after oesophagectomy were recorded for all patients operated on between January 2006 and February 2017, with severity defined using the Clavien-Dindo classification. Associations between complications and overall and recurrence-free survival were assessed using univariable and multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS Of 430 patients, 292 (67·9 per cent) developed postoperative complications, with 128 (39·8 per cent) classified as Clavien-Dindo grade III or IV. No significant associations were detected between Clavien-Dindo grade and either tumour (T) (P = 0·071) or nodal (N) status (P = 0·882). There was a significant correlation between Clavien-Dindo grade and ASA fitness grade (P = 0·032). In multivariable analysis, overall survival in patients with Clavien-Dindo grade I complications was similar to that in patients with no complications (hazard ratio (HR) 0·97, P = 0·915). However, patients with grade II and IV complications had significantly shorter overall survival than those with no complications: HR 1·64 (P = 0·007) and 1·74 (P = 0·013) respectively. CONCLUSION Increasing severity of complications after oesophagectomy was associated with decreased overall survival. Prevention of complications should improve survival.","Bundred, J R; Hollis, A C; Evans, R; Hodson, J; Whiting, J L; Griffiths, E A",BJS open,221,31

Objectives To evaluate knowledge assessments of pharmacists, prescribers, and patients regarding appropriate TIRF use; to describe sponsor assessments, based on claims data, of whether the REMS program was meeting its goals; and to characterize how the FDA responded to REMS assessments. Design, Setting, and Participants Qualitative analysis of 4877 pages of FDA documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, including 6 annual REMS assessment reports (2012-2017), FDA evaluations of these reports, and FDA-sponsor correspondence about safety issues. Exposure A REMS program to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes, including misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose, arising from use of TIRFs. Main Outcomes and Measures (1) Knowledge assessments of pharmacists, prescribers, and patients; (2) survey and claims-based prescribing assessments; (3) FDA and TIRF sponsor communications; (4) modifications to the REMS program; and (5) disenrollment of noncompliant prescribers. Results Twelve months after initiation of the program, 24 of 302 pharmacists (7.9%), 35 of 302 prescribers (11.6%), and 5 of 192 patients (2.6%) incorrectly reported that TIRFs can be prescribed to opioid-nontolerant patients, with similar levels of misunderstanding maintained in the subsequent reports. At 60 months, product-specific analyses of claims data indicated that between 34.6% and 55.4% of patients prescribed TIRFs were opioid-nontolerant. In the 48-month survey, 106 of 310 prescribers (34.2%) reported prescribing TIRFs for opioid-tolerant patients with chronic, noncancer pain; at 60 months, 54 of 302 prescribers (18.4%) and 148 of 310 patients (47.7%) erroneously reported that TIRFs were FDA-approved for such use. Over the 60-month period examined, there were few substantive changes made to the REMS to address evidence of high rates of off-label TIRF use, and, although the REMS program had a noncompliance plan, there was no report of prescribers being disenrolled for inappropriate prescribing. Conclusions and Relevance In this review of FDA documents pertaining to the TIRF REMS, surveys of pharmacists, prescribers, and patients reflected generally high levels of knowledge regarding proper TIRF prescribing, yet some survey items as well as claims-based analyses indicated substantial rates of inappropriate TIRF use. Despite these findings, the FDA did not require substantive changes to the program.","Rollman, Jeffrey Eric; Heyward, James; Olson, Lily; Lurie, Peter; Sharfstein, Joshua; Alexander, G Caleb",JAMA,221,1

OBJECTIVE To analyze the results of a consecutive series of patients with unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs), including a subgroup analysis of ARUBA-eligible patients. METHODS One hundred five patients with unruptured BAVMs were treated over an 8-year period. From this series, 90 adult patients and a subgroup of 61 patients determined to be ARUBA eligible were retrospectively reviewed. A subgroup analysis for Spetzler-Martin grades I/II, III, and IV/V was performed. The modified Rankin Scale was used to assess functional outcome. RESULTS Persistent deficits, modified Rankin Scale score deterioration, and impaired functional outcome occurred less frequently in ARUBA-eligible grade I/II patients compared with grade III to V patients combined (P = .04, P = .04, P = .03, respectively). Twenty-two of 39 patients (56%) unruptured grade I and II BAVMs were treated with surgery without and with preoperative embolization, and all had a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1 at the last follow-up. All patients treated with surgery without and with preoperative embolization had radiographic cure at the last follow-up. CONCLUSION The results of ARUBA-eligible and unruptured grade I/II patients overall show that excellent outcomes can be obtained in this subgroup of patients, especially with surgical management. Functional outcomes for ARUBA-eligible patients were similar to those of patients who were randomized to medical management in ARUBA. On the basis of these data, in appropriately selected patients, we recommend treatment for low-grade BAVMs.","Nerva, John D; Mantovani, Alessandra; Barber, Jason; Kim, Louis J; Rockhill, Jason K; Hallam, Danial K; Ghodke, Basavaraj V; Sekhar, Laligam N",Neurosurgery,221,22

Few studies have assessed the prevalence of coronary artery disease in masters athletes with a low atherosclerotic risk profile. METHODS We assessed 152 masters athletes 54.4±8.5 years of age (70% male) and 92 controls of similar age, sex, and low Framingham 10-year coronary artery disease risk scores with an echocardiogram, exercise stress test, computerized tomographic coronary angiogram, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement and a 24-hour Holter. Athletes had participated in endurance exercise for an average of 31±12.6 years. The majority (77%) were runners, with a median of 13 marathon runs per athlete. RESULTS Most athletes (60%) and controls (63%) had a normal CAC score. Male athletes had a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques of any luminal irregularity (44.3% versus 22.2%; P=0.009) compared with sedentary males, and only male athletes showed a CAC ≥300 Agatston units (11.3%) and a luminal stenosis ≥50% (7.5%). Male athletes demonstrated predominantly calcific plaques (72.7%), whereas sedentary males showed predominantly mixed morphology plaques (61.5%). The number of years of training was the only independent variable associated with increased risk of CAC >70th percentile for age or luminal stenosis ≥50% in male athletes (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.15; P=0.016); 15 (14%) male athletes but none of the controls revealed late gadolinium enhancement on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Of these athletes, 7 had a pattern consistent with previous myocardial infarction, including 3(42%) with a luminal stenosis ≥50% in the corresponding artery. CONCLUSIONS Most lifelong masters endurance athletes with a low atherosclerotic risk profile have normal CAC scores. Male athletes are more likely to have a CAC score >300 Agatston units or coronary plaques compared with sedentary males with a similar risk profile.

112551,112551,112551,Innovation Is Tied to Optimism.,13.875773,3.1146262,2021,"BACKGROUND Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), driven by the obesity epidemic, has become the most common form of liver disease. Despite this, there is controversy regarding the prevalence and severity of NAFLD in obesity. Obesity-related factors, such as increasing adiposity, metabolic disease and inflammation, may influence prevalence. We therefore prospectively measured NAFLD prevalence in obesity and studied factors associated with NAFLD. MATERIALS AND METHODS We recruited consecutive bariatric patients. Intraoperative liver biopsies were taken. The liver, adipose tissue and serum were collected to measure inflammation. Adipocyte cell size was measured. NAFLD severity was correlated to body mass index (BMI), metabolic health and adipose characteristics. RESULTS There were 216 participants; BMI 45.9 ± 8.9 kg/m2, age 44.4 ± 12.1 years, 75.5% female. Overall NAFLD prevalence was 74.1%, with 17.1% having non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and/or steatofibrosis. Odds of NASH/steatofibrosis increased independently with BMI category (odds ratio (OR) 2.28-3.46, all p < 0.05) and metabolic disease (OR 3.79, p = 0.003). These odds markedly increased when both super obesity (BMI > 50) and metabolic disease were present (OR 9.71, p < 0.001). NASH/steatofibrosis prevalence was significantly greater with diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. Although greater visceral adipocyte hypertrophy was evident in NASH/steatofibrosis, there was no significant association between adipose inflammation and NASH/steatofibrosis. CONCLUSION NAFLD remains endemic in obesity; however, NASH/steatofibrosis are less common than previously reported. Worsening obesity and metabolic disease increase odds of NAFLD independently, with substantially compounded effect with both. These observations may help with risk stratification in obese populations. We were unable to delineate clear associations between adipose inflammation and NASH/steatofibrosis in this obese population.

METHODS Participants were premenopausal women (N = 183). Path models evaluated whether early life trauma predicted early pubertal timing and thereby, adult epigenetic age acceleration (indexed via four epigenetic clocks: Horvath DNAm Age, Hannum DNAm Age, DNAm PhenoAge, and DNAm GrimAge). Secondary analyses explored the effects of type of trauma (abuse and neglect) and adult chronic stress status (caregiver of child with autism and non-caregiver). RESULTS Early life trauma and earlier age at menarche independently predicted accelerated aging based on one of the four epigenetic clocks, DNAm GrimAge, though early life trauma was not associated with age of menarche. Childhood abuse, but not neglect, predicted faster epigenetic aging; results did not differ by chronic stress status. CONCLUSIONS Early trauma and early menarche appear to exert independent effects on DNAm GrimAge, which has been shown to be the strongest epigenetic predictor of mortality risk. This study identifies a potential correlate or determinant of accelerated epigenetic aging-menarcheal age. Future research should address the limitations of this study by using racially diverse samples.","Hamlat, Elissa J; Prather, Aric A; Horvath, Steve; Belsky, Jay; Epel, Elissa S",Developmental psychobiology,221,20

Uncertainty exists about the effect of intra-arterial therapy in patients with contraindications for treatment with intravenous alteplase treatment. Our aim was to describe the clinical characteristics of this subgroup of patients and whether intra-arterial therapy is as safe and effective as it is after intravenous alteplase treatment. METHODS All 500 MR CLEAN patients were included and we distinguished between patients who were and were not treated with intravenous alteplase treatment. We estimated the effect of intra-arterial therapy on the shift on the modified Rankin Scale score with ordinal logistic regression analysis and tested for interaction of intravenous alteplase treatment with intra-arterial therapy on outcome. Furthermore, safety parameters and serious adverse events were analyzed. RESULTS Fifty-five patients (11%) were not treated with intravenous alteplase treatment, mostly because of prolonged coagulation time tests or recent surgery. These patients were older and more often had atrial fibrillation or other vascular comorbidity. There was no interaction between intravenous alteplase treatment and intervention effect (p = 0.927). Intra-arterial therapy effect size in patients without intravenous alteplase treatment was 2.06 [95% CI: 0.69-6.13] and in patients with intravenous alteplase treatment 1.71 [95% CI: 1.22-2.40]. There were no safety issues. CONCLUSIONS For patients with acute ischemic anterior circulation stroke caused by intracranial large vessel occlusion, who have contraindications for intravenous alteplase, intra-arterial treatment is not less effective or less safe than in patients who receive the treatment after intravenous alteplase.

The incidence and mortality for colorectal cancer is augmented in overweight and obese individuals. Previous studies demonstrated an impaired number, phenotype and functionality of natural killer (NK) cells under obese conditions. So far, the influence of obesity on NK cells in colorectal cancer tissue remained unclear. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the occurrence and localization of NK cells in colorectal tumors of normal weight and diet-induced obese rats. METHODS Wistar rats were fed a normal-fat diet (control) or a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce obesity. In half of the experimental groups azoxymethane (AOM) was injected to induce colorectal cancer. Tumors in colon and rectum were histopathologically classified in adenomas and adenocarcinomas and immunohistologically stained with the rat NK cell marker CD161. Occurrence and localization of NK cells were analyzed and quantified in the tunica mucosa and tunica submucosa of colorectal adenomas and the tunica submucosa of colorectal adenocarcinomas. RESULTS NK cells are localized in the tunica mucosa and the tunica submucosa of colorectal tumors with NK cell accumulations as follicle-like aggregates especially in regions of the lamina muscularis mucosae and the lamina propria mucosae of the tunica mucosa as well as in regions of the tunica submucosa adjacent to the lamina muscularis mucosae. Although not statistically significant, the CD161 staining was clearly reduced in the tunica mucosa of colorectal tumors of rats fed a HFD compared to rats fed a control diet. Moreover, the CD161 staining in the tunica mucosa was positively correlated with the final body weight of AOM-treated rats independent of the supplied diet. DISCUSSION For the first time, these results provide information about the localization and quantity of NK cells in colorectal tumor tissue of rats fed a control diet or high-fat diet. The slight reduction of NK cell number in colorectal tissue of rats fed a high-fat diet may contribute to an impaired tumor defense and the increased colorectal tumor outcome in diet-induced obese rats.","Bähr, Ina; JannesPörtner, Ole; Glass, Markus; Doberstein, Henriette; Goritz, Vincent; Hiller, Grit Gesine Ruth; Spielmann, Julia; Kielstein, Heike",Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft,221,16

However, limited functional and histological information exists regarding the effects of cryopreservation on allogeneic skin grafts, especially those across mismatched histocompatibility barriers. Thus, we performed a side-by-side comparative study of fresh vs frozen skin grafts, across both minor and major histocompatibility barriers, in a miniature swine model. Since porcine skin shares many physical and immunological properties with human skin, our findings have relevance to current clinical practices involving allogeneic grafting and may support future, temporary wound therapies involving frozen xenografts, comprised genetically modified porcine skin. Four miniature swine underwent harvest and grafting of split-thickness skin, with and without cryopreservation, in order to observe autologous grafts and grafts across minor and major histocompatibility barriers. A biopsy of the grafts was done at regular intervals for study of architecture, vascularization, and outcomes. All grafts vascularized without technical complications. Differences were noted in the early appearance of some fresh vs frozen grafts, but no significant difference was observed in overall survival times in any of the experimental groups. These results demonstrate that despite early observable differences in the healing process, cryopreservation and thawing does not significantly affect long-term graft survival or time to rejection, thus supporting the clinical and experimental use of fresh and frozen split-thickness skin grafts as comparable and interchangeable.","Holzer, Paul W; Leonard, David A; Shanmugarajah, Kumaran; Moulton, Krysta N; Ng, Zhi Yang; Cetrulo, Curtis L; Sachs, David H",Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,221,1

OBJECTIVE Based on a standardised AP view of the AC joint, the objective of this study was to determine whether this radiographic view is reliable and reproducible for evaluating the AC joint space. METHODS A cadaver scapula-clavicle unit, free of osteoarthritis, was used for this study. The scapula was positioned in a stand; and then with fluoroscopy guidance, a strict AP view of the AC joint was taken. Starting from this ""0"" position, a radiograph was taken by varying the angle by 5°, 10°, and 15° in every plane in space. All radiographs were taken during a single session to ensure the distance between the X-ray tube and scapula did not change. The images were then exported to OsiriX for processing; the superior and inferior AC distance and the joint area were measured. RESULTS There was no reproducibility in the AC joint measurements as a function of the incidence angle relative to a strict AP view. CONCLUSION Conventional radiography using an AP view of the AC joint cannot be used to do a fine analysis of arthritic degeneration of this joint. It is likely that only CT scan or MRI is sufficient to analyse osteoarthritis in this joint.

Roots/rhizomes micromorphology, DNA barcoding and EOs phytochemical characterization were carried out, while biological effects on the nervous system were assessed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity and microelectrode arrays (MEA). Nj showed the highest inhibitory activity on AChE (IC50 67.15 μg/mL) followed by Vo (IC50 127.30 μg/mL) and Vj (IC50 246.84 μg/mL).

These results could be related to different EO compositions, since sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes significantly contribute to the observed effects, but the presence of oxygenated compounds such as aldehydes and ketones is a discriminating factor in determining the order of potency. Our multidisciplinary approach represents an important tool to avoid the adulteration of herbal drugs and permits the evaluation of the effectiveness of EOs that could be used for a wide range of therapeutic applications.","Cornara, Laura; Ambu, Gabriele; Trombetta, Domenico; Denaro, Marcella; Alloisio, Susanna; Frigerio, Jessica; Labra, Massimo; Ghimire, Govinda; Valussi, Marco; Smeriglio, Antonella",Plants,221,12

Though well-intentioned, this nonspecific designation highlights stereotypes of older adults as frail and in need of protection, exacerbating negative age-based stereotypes that can have adverse effects on older adults' well-being. Healthcare stereotype threat (HCST) is concern about being judged by providers and receiving biased medical treatment based on stereotypes about one's identity - in this case age. Given the attention to older adults' physical vulnerabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults may be especially worried about age-based judgments from medical providers and sensitive to ageist attitudes about COVID-19.

We aimed to delineate and compare the immunologic features of severe and moderate COVID-19. METHODS In this retrospective study, the clinical and immunologic characteristics of 21 patients (17 male and 4 female) with COVID-19 were analyzed. These patients were classified as severe (11 cases) and moderate (10 cases) according to the Guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China. RESULTS The median age of severe and moderate cases was 61.0 and 52.0 years, respectively. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough and fatigue. Compared to moderate cases, severe cases more frequently had dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. Absolute number of T lymphocytes, CD4+T and CD8+T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were markedly lower in severe cases (294.0, 177.5 and 89.0 × 106/L) than moderate cases (640.5, 381.5 and 254.0 × 106/L).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventy-one patients with CRCLM undergoing thermal ablation at our institute from 2009 to 2013 were identified and analysed to formulate a prognostic nomogram. The concordance index (C-index) and calibration curve were calculated to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the nomogram. The nomogram was compared with two current prognostic nomograms for patients with CRCLM who had undergone hepatectomy (Kattan) and selective internal radiation therapy (Fendler). Predictive validity was assessed in the validation cohort of 25 patients who had undergone thermal ablation from 2014 to 2016. RESULTS The median OS in the primary cohort was 26.4 months, whereas the 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates were 72.2%, 37.2% and 17%, respectively. The median progression-free survival was 4.2 months. After univariate and multivariate analysis, a prognostic nomogram was formulated based on four predictors, including the number of tumours, maximum diameter of the tumour, CA19-9 level and ablation margin. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.815. Based on the patients of this study, the C-index was significantly higher than that of the Fendler nomogram (C-index, 0.698) and Kattan nomogram (C-index, 0.514, p < 0.001). Predictive accuracy of the proposed nomogram was also satisfactory in the validation cohort, with a C-index of 0.884. CONCLUSIONS Thermal ablation was an effective therapy for CRCLM. Moreover, the nomogram was effective and simple for CRCLM patients undergoing thermal ablation.","Wang, Yang; Zheng, Jiasheng; Chen, Hui; Hu, Caixia; Sun, Bin; Wang, Haiyan; Shi, Qinsheng; Long, Jiang; Zhang, Honghai; Li, Wei","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",221,16

The cellular mechanisms responsible for the generation of DCs that will prime a proinflammatory or tolerogenic response are poorly understood. Here we describe a novel mechanism by which tolerogenic DCs are formed from monocytes. When human monocytes were cultured with CD4+FoxP3+ natural regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper cells (Th) from healthy donor blood, they differentiated into regulatory DCs (DC Reg ), capable of generating induced Tregs from naïve T cells. DC Reg exhibited morphology, surface phenotype, cytokine secretion, and transcriptome that were distinct from other moDCs including those derived from monocytes cultured with Th or with GM-CSF/IL-4, as well as macrophages (MΦ). Direct cell contact between monocytes, Tregs and Th, along with Treg-derived CTLA-4, IL-10 and TGF-β, was required for the phenotypic differentiation of DC Reg , although only IL-10 was required for imprinting the Treg-inducing capacity of DC Reg . High ratios of Treg:Th, along with monocytes and DC Reg similar in function and phenotype to those induced in vitro, were present in situ in human colorectal cancer specimens. Thus, through the combined actions of Tregs and Th, monocytes differentiate into DCs with regulatory properties, forming a positive feedback loop to reinforce Treg initiated immune regulation. This mechanism may contribute to immune tolerance in tissues such as tumors, which contain an abundance of Tregs, Th and monocytes.","Zhang, Xiangyue; Zheng, Pingping; Prestwood, Tyler R; Zhang, Hong; Carmi, Yaron; Tolentino, Lorna L; Wu, Nancy; Choi, Okmi; Winer, Daniel A; Strober, Samuel; Kang, Eun-Suk; Alonso, Michael N; Engleman, Edgar G",Frontiers in immunology,221,1

METHODS We conducted an intensive literature search on current or emerging AI and autonomous technologies (eg, vehicles), military and medical technologies (eg, surgical robots), relevant frameworks and standards, cyber security/safety- and legal-systems worldwide. We provide a discussion on unique challenges for robotic surgery faced by proposals made for AI more generally (eg, Explainable AI) and machine learning more specifically (eg, black box), as well as recommendations for developing and improving relevant frameworks or standards. CONCLUSION We classify responsibility into the following: (1) Accountability; (2) Liability; and (3) Culpability. All three aspects were addressed when discussing responsibility for AI and autonomous surgical robots, be these civil or military patients (however, these aspects may require revision in cases where robots become citizens). The component which produces the least clarity is Culpability, since it is unthinkable in the current state of technology.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 27 individuals diagnosed with unilateral non-functional kidney secondary to tuberculosis were treated between June 2011 and June 2015. All patients had normal renal function on the contralateral side and underwent the standard four-drug anti-tuberculosis treatment for at least four weeks before surgery. Total retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephroureterectomy was performed in all patients, and the urinary-bladder junction of distal ureter was managed using different auto-suture techniques. RESULTS Nineteen male and 8 female patients with an average age of 47.3 years (range, 36-64 years) underwent surgery. All the operations were successfully performed without conversion. The median operative time was 109.3 min (range, 75-138 min), the median blood loss was 157.5 mL (range, 70-250 mL), and the median hospitalization time was 3.7 days (range, 3-6 days). No serious perioperative complications occurred. Anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy was prescribed to all patients, with the entire course of treatment lasting six months. No recurrence of tuberculosis of the bladder or the contralateral kidney was observed during the median follow-up period of 26.7 months (range, 6-54 months). CONCLUSION Retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephroureterectomy with urinary-bladder junction resection is a safe and feasible approach for the treatment of tuberculous non-functional kidneys.","Li, Canqiang; Yang, Yi; Xu, Le; Qiu, Minjie",International braz j urol : official journal of the Brazilian Society of Urology,221,17

The clinical effectiveness of this intervention in improving postoperative outcomes is debated. METHODS We undertook a retrospective analysis of data describing surgical checklist use from a 7 day cohort study of surgical outcomes in 28 European nations (European Surgical Outcomes Study, EuSOS). The analysis included hospitals recruiting >10 patients and excluding outlier hospitals above the 95th centile for mortality. Multivariate logistic regression and three-level hierarchical generalized mixed models were constructed to explore the relationship between surgical checklist use and hospital mortality. Findings are presented as crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS A total of 45 591 patients from 426 hospitals were included in the analysis. A surgical checklist was used in 67.5% patients, with marked variation across countries (0-99.6% of patients). Surgical checklist exposure was associated with lower crude hospital mortality (OR 0.84, CI 0.75-0.94; P=0.002). This effect remained after adjustment for baseline risk factors in a multivariate model (adjusted OR 0.81, CI 0.70-0.94; P<0.005) and strengthened after adjusting for variations within countries and hospitals in a three-level generalized mixed model (adjusted OR 0.71, CI 0.58-0.85; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The use of surgical checklists varies across European nations. Reported use of a checklist was associated with lower mortality. This observation may represent a protective effect of the surgical checklist itself, or alternatively, may be an indirect indicator of the quality of perioperative care.

Paclitaxel-eluting balloon (PEB) angioplasty, stenting, and directional atherectomy (DA) have provided new options for the treatment of superficial femoral artery disease; however, the comparative efficacy of these interventional strategies remains uncertain. METHODS One hundred and fifty-five patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease due to de novo superficial femoral artery stenotic or occlusive lesions were randomized to treatment with plain balloon angioplasty (BA) followed by PEB angioplasty and stenting (n=48), BA and stenting (n=52), or DA with distal protection and bailout stenting (n=55). The primary end point of the study was percentage diameter stenosis after 6 months measured by angiography. Other end points included target lesion revascularization, thrombosis, ipsilateral amputation, binary restenosis, and all-cause mortality at 6 and 24 months. RESULTS Baseline and lesion characteristics were comparable in all groups with a mean lesion length of 65.9±46.8 mm and 56% total occlusions. At 6 months angiography, the percent diameter stenosis was significantly lower in patients treated by PEB angioplasty and stenting (34±31%) as compared with BA angioplasty and stenting (56±29%, P=0.009) or DA (55±29%, P=0.007). Similarly, binary restenosis was significantly lower after treatment with PEB and stenting as compared with BA and stenting or DA. Clinical follow-up at 24 months revealed a lower risk for target lesion revascularization after PEB angioplasty and stenting as compared with BA and stenting or DA. We found no difference in terms of target lesion thrombosis and mortality among groups, and no patient underwent amputation. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of de novo superficial femoral artery lesions with PEB angioplasty and stenting is superior to BA angioplasty and stenting or DA in terms of angiographic diameter stenosis at 6 months and target lesion revascularization at 24 months.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cross-sectional study. METHODS Sixty-nine eyes of 69 patients with successfully reattached macula-off RRD were retrospectively analyzed. Six radial spectral-domain optical coherence tomographic (OCT) images were used to evaluate the effects of the ICCs on detached macula and to measure the angle of the retina at the macula as a parameter to evaluate the anterior protrusion of the detached retina. The findings were compared to other parameters. RESULTS The mean angle of the retina at the macula was 143.1 ± 15.9° with a range of 108 to 172°. Preoperatively, 51 eyes (74%) had ICCs in the inner nuclear layer and/or the outer plexiform layer and Henle fiber layer complex, but none was present after surgery. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that the angle of the retina was significantly associated with the presence of ICCs (β = -0.637, P<0.001) and the height of subretinal fluid (β = -0.256, P = 0.005). Eyes with ICCs had poorer preoperative vision (P<0.001), narrower angle of the retina (P<0.001), and thicker subretinal fluid (P<0.001) than eyes without cavities. CONCLUSIONS The anterior protrusion in eyes with macula-off RRD is associated with the presence of ICCs. The presence of ICCs can affect preoperative function and morphology but does not affect postoperative function and morphology.","Iwase, Takeshi; Tomita, Ryo; Ra, Eimei; Iwase, Chie; Terasaki, Hiroko",Japanese journal of ophthalmology,221,29

Two phantoms were used to assess the possible application of scatter imaging for markerless tracking of lung tumors during stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatment. A scatter-imaging camera was assembled with a CsI flat-panel detector and a 5 mm diameter pinhole collimator. Scatter images were collected during the irradiation of phantoms with megavoltage photons. To assess scatter image quality, spherical phantom lung tumors of 2.1 - 2.8 cm diameters were placed inside a static, anthropomorphic phantom. To show the efficacy of the technique with a moving target (3 cm diameter), the position of a simulated tumor was tracked in scatter images during sinusoidal motion (15 mm amplitude, 0.25 Hz frequency) in a dynamic lung phantom in open-field, dynamic conformal arc (DCA), and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) deliveries. Anatomical features are identifiable on static phantom scatter images collected with 10 MU of delivered dose (2.1 cm diameter lung tumor contrast-to-noise ratio of 4.4). The contrast-to-noise ratio increases with tumor size and delivered dose. During dynamic motion, the position of the 3.0 cm diameter lung tumor was identified with a root-mean-square error of 0.8, 1.2, and 2.9 mm for open field (0.3 s frame integration), DCA (0.5 s), and VMAT (0.5 s), respectively. Based on phantom studies, scatter imaging is a potential technique for markerless lung tumor tracking during SBRT without additional imaging dose. Quality scatter images may be collected at low, clinically relevant doses (10 MU). Scatter images are capable of sub-millimeter tracking precision, but modulation decreases accuracy.","Jones, Kevin C; Turian, Julius V; Redler, Gage; Cifter, Gizem; Strologas, John; Templeton, Alistair; Bernard, Damian; Chu, James C H",Physics in medicine and biology,221,1

Although the results in literature look promising, uncertainty exists with regard to complication risks and survival for this therapy. METHODS From January 2000 to May 2013, patients were included in a prospective multicenter database when treated for CRLM. Exclusion criteria were: two-staged treatment, synchronous resection of liver metastases and primary tumor, loss to follow-up or extrahepatic metastases. Patients were divided in a resection-only group (ROG) and combination group (CG). Outcome variables were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS In CG, 98 patients were included versus 534 patients in ROG. There were no differences in general patient characteristics. Patients in CG had a higher Fong clinical risk score (CRS; P = 0.001), better ASA classification (P = 0.04) and received more neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.001). There was no difference in postoperative morbidity or 90-day mortality. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) for CG and ROG was 25% and 36.1% (P = 0.03), respectively. For the 5-year overall survival (OS) this was respectively 42% and 62.2% (P = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, Fong CRS was a significant predictor for DFS. For OS, Fong CRS, ASA class IV and the combination therapy were significant predictors. CONCLUSION The combination of hepatic resection and intraoperative RFA is a safe procedure, without increase in postoperative morbidity or mortality. Combining RFA and resection in one session is a valid treatment option for patients who would otherwise be inoperable.","van Amerongen, M J; van der Stok, E P; Fütterer, J J; Jenniskens, S F M; Moelker, A; Grünhagen, D J; Verhoef, C; de Wilt, J H W",European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology,221,5

The over-production and over-consumption of meat and dairy products is resource-intensive, energy-dense and creates public health and food equity risks, including the creation of superbugs and antimicrobial resistance, contamination and pollution of land and waterways, and injustice to animals and humans who work in the sector. Yet the continuing and expanding use of animals is entrenched in food systems. One policy response frequently suggested by parties from all sectors (industry, government and civil society) is voluntary or mandatory labelling reforms to educate consumers about the healthiness and sustainability of food products, and thus reduce demand. This paper evaluates the pitfalls and potentials of labelling as an incremental regulatory governance stepping-stone to transformative food system change. METHODS We use empirical data from a study of the regulatory politics of animal welfare and environmental claims on Australian products together with an ecological regulation conceptual approach to critically evaluate the potential of labelling as a regulatory mechanism. RESULTS We show that labelling is generally ineffective as a pathway to transformative food system change for three reasons: it does not do enough to redistribute power away from dominant actors to those harmed by the food system; it is vulnerable to greenwashing and reductionism; and it leads to market segmentation rather than collective political action. CONCLUSION We suggest the need for regulatory governance that is ecological by design. Labelling can only be effective when connected to a broader suite of measures to reduce overall production and consumption of meat. We conclude with some recommendations as to how public health advocates and policy entrepreneurs might strategically use and contest labelling and certification schemes to build support for transformative food system change and to avoid the regressive consequences of labelling.","Parker, Christine; Carey, Rachel; Haines, Fiona; Johnson, Hope",International journal of health policy and management,221,1

Case reports and series with <5 cases, conference abstracts, and articles written in languages other than English were excluded. DATA SYNTHESIS Of the 1256 unique reports, 15 met inclusion criteria: 12 retrospective, 3 prospective, and 3 comparative with untreated control groups. All studies except for 2 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) studies were in immunocompromised patients (9 malignancy/stem cell transplant, 4 lung transplant). The mortality rate ranged from 0% to 31% in malignancy/stem cell transplant recipients treated with oral ribavirin, and 1/108 (0.9%) ribavirin-treated lung transplant recipients died at 30 days. Three studies (one each for malignancy, lung transplant, and MERS-CoV) suggested a clinical outcomes benefit with oral ribavirin compared with supportive care alone; however, the nonrandomized design precludes efficacy determination. Hemolysis was the most common adverse reaction, occurring in 14% (54/375) of patients. Ribavirin was discontinued in 4% of patients secondary to adverse reactions.

In this paper, we present the protocol for two systematic reviews of parameters for estimating the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (or keratinocyte carcinoma) from occupational exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation, to inform the development of the WHO/ILO joint methodology. OBJECTIVES We aim to systematically review studies on occupational exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (Systematic Review 1) and systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of occupational exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation on melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (Systematic Review 2), applying the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology as an organizing framework and conducting both systematic reviews in tandem and in a harmonized way. DATA SOURCES Separately for Systematic Reviews 1 and 2, we will search electronic academic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including Ovid Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. We will also search electronic grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand-search reference list of previous systematic reviews and included study records and consult additional experts. STUDY ELIGIBILITY AND CRITERIA We will include working-age (≥15 years) workers in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State, but exclude children (<15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. For Systematic Review 1, we will include quantitative studies on the prevalence of relevant levels of occupational exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (i.e. <0.33 SED/d and ≥0.33 SED/d) and of the total working time spent outdoors, stratified by country, sex, age and industrial sector or occupation, in the years 1960 to 2018. For Systematic Review 2, we will include randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the effect of any occupational exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (i.e., ≥0.33 SED/d) on the prevalence of, incidence of or mortality due to melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, compared with the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (i.e. <0.33 SED/d). STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS At least two review authors will independently screen titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. At least two review authors will assess the risk of bias and the quality of evidence, using the most suited tools currently available. For Systematic Review 2, if feasible, we will combine relative risks using meta-analysis.

The field is in need of technology that helps bridge the macroscopic and microscopic regimes. To solve this problem, we developed a fiducial marker (FM) simultaneously compatible with 2-color near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700 and 800 nm), autoradiography, and conventional hematoxylin-eosin (HE) histology. METHODS The FM was constructed from an optimized concentration of commercially available human serum albumin, 700- and 800-nm NIR fluorophores, (99m)Tc-pertechnetate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and glutaraldehyde. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis cells coexpressing the sodium iodide symporter and green fluorescent protein were labeled with 700-nm fluorophore and (99m)Tc-pertechnatate and then administered intratracheally into CD-1 mice. After in vivo SPECT imaging and ex vivo SPECT and NIR fluorescence imaging of the lungs, 30-μm frozen sections were prepared and processed for 800-nm NIR fluorophore costaining, autoradiography, and HE staining on the same slide using the FMs to coregister all datasets. RESULTS Optimized FMs, composed of 100 μM unlabeled human serum albumin, 1 μM NIR fluorescent human serum albumin, 15% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 3% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), were prepared within 15 min, displayed homogeneity and stability, and were visible by all imaging modalities, including HE staining. Using these FMs, tissue displaying high signal by SPECT could be dissected and analyzed on the same slide and at the microscopic level for 700-nm NIR fluorescence, 800-nm NIR fluorescence, autoradiography, and HE histopathologic staining. CONCLUSION When multimodal FMs are combined with a new technique for simultaneous same-slide NIR fluorescence imaging, autoradiography, and HE staining, macroscopic in vivo images can now be studied unambiguously at the microscopic level.","Inoue, Kazumasa; Gibbs, Summer L; Liu, Fangbing; Lee, Jeong Heon; Xie, Yang; Ashitate, Yoshitomo; Fujii, Hirofumi; Frangioni, John V; Choi, Hak Soo","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",221,1

METHODOLOGY A prospective interventional case series study was performed, and 32 patients with COVID-19 were selected at the Pamukkale University Hospital from 15 to 22 May 2020. The tear and conjunctival samples were collected by a conjunctival swab. Each specimen was sent to the laboratory for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses. To avoid cross-infection, gloves and personal protective equipment were changed after collecting each sample. RESULTS 32 patients (18 male, 14 female) with Covid-19 were included in this cross-sectional study. The average age of the patients was 52.81 ± 16.76 years. By the time of the first collection of conjunctival-tear samples, the mean time of the onset of complaints was 6.84 ± 6.81 (1-35) days. Tear-conjunctival samples from 5 patients (16%) without conjunctivitis yielded positive PCR results, 3 of whom had positive and 2 negative nasopharyngeal PCR results. CONCLUSIONS Five of 32 patients (16 %) without conjunctivitis or any eye symptoms had viral RNA in their tear-conjunctival samples. The possibility of transmission via tears and conjunctival secretions should be recognized even in the absence of conjunctivitis or other ocular manifestations.","Kaya, Hüseyin; Çalışkan, Ahmet; Okul, Mehmet; Sarı, Tuğba; Akbudak, İsmail Hakkı",Journal of infection in developing countries,221,1

The transfer of traditional face-to-face bullying to the virtual environment is one of the risks adolescents face in this new reality. The present study sought to explore the relationship between involvement in cyberbullying and behaviours such as internet and mobile usage and other risky online behaviours. METHOD The sample consisted of 3,188 adolescents aged 12-17 years old (Mean= 14.44; SD= 1.67). RESULTS The application of the European Cyberbullying Intervention Project Questionnaire (ECIPQ) found that 5.2% were victims, 4.5% perpetrators and 4.3% bully-victims. CONCLUSIONS Results also showed that cyberbullying seems to be associated with both Problematic Internet Use and behaviours such as sexting, gambling and contacting strangers, which suggests a need for a comprehensive approach for preventing all these issues. Moreover, parental monitoring could serve as a modulating factor, which should also be taken into account in the development of appropriate prevention strategies.","Feijóo, Sandra; Foody, Mairéad; O'Higgins Norman, James; Pichel, Rafael; Rial, Antonio",Psicothema,221,33

One hypothesis is that metritis causes persistent changes in granulosa cells during follicle development, which might be evident in the transcriptome of granulosa cells from dominant follicles weeks after parturition. To test this hypothesis we collected follicular fluid and granulosa cells from dominant follicles 63 days post partum from cows previously diagnosed with metritis, at least 6 weeks after resolution of the disease, and from cows not diagnosed with metritis (control cows). Bacterial lipopolysaccharide was detected in follicular fluid, and concentrations were associated with follicular fluid IL-8 and glucose concentrations. Transcriptome analysis using RNAseq revealed 177 differentially expressed genes in granulosa cells collected from cows that had metritis compared with control cows. The most upregulated genes were ITLN1, NCF2, CLRN3, FSIP2 and ANKRD17, and the most downregulated genes were ACSM1, NR4A2, GHITM, CBARP and NR1I3. Pathway analysis indicated that the differentially expressed genes were involved with immune function, cell-cell communication, cell cycle and cellular metabolism. Predicted upstream regulators of the differentially expressed genes included NFκB, IL-21 and lipopolysaccharide, which are associated with infection and immunity. Our data provide evidence for a persistent effect of metritis on the transcriptome of granulosa cells in ovarian follicles after the resolution of disease.","Piersanti, Rachel L; Horlock, Anthony D; Block, Jeremy; Santos, Jose E P; Sheldon, Iain Martin; Bromfield, John James",Reproduction,221,1

However, we lack a framework for describing the range of competences involved. The objective of the current work was to develop a competency framework for health behaviour change interventions. METHOD A preliminary framework was developed by two judges rating the relevance of items in the competency framework for cognitive behaviour therapies; adding relevant items from reviews and other competency frameworks; and obtaining feedback from potential users on a draft framework. The Health Behaviour Change Competency Framework (HBCCF) was used to analyse the competency content of smoking cessation manuals. RESULTS Judges identified 194 competency items as relevant, which were organised into two domains: foundation (12 competency topics comprising 56 competencies) and behaviour change (12 topics, 54 competencies); several of the 54 and 56 competencies were composed of sub-competencies (84 subcompetencies in total). Smoking cessation manuals included 14 competency topics from the foundation and behaviour change competency domains. CONCLUSION The HBCCF provides a structured method for assessing and reporting competency to deliver behaviour change interventions. It can be applied to assess a practitioner's competency and training needs and to identify the competencies needed for a particular intervention. To date, it has been used in self-assessments and in developing training programmes. We propose the HBCCF as a practical tool for researchers, employers, and those who design and provide training. We envisage the HBCFF maturing and adapting as evidence that identifies the essential elements required for the effective delivery of behaviour change interventions emerges.","Dixon, Diane; Johnston, Marie",International journal of behavioral medicine,221,12

We report an unusual case to provide possible solution on this issue. A 71-year-old man with lung adenocarcinoma had an event of a broken exchange catheter used during a DLT replacement with a SLT, after a video-assisted thoracic surgery. The exchange catheter was impinged at the distal tracheal lumen and snapped during manipulation. All three segments of the catheter were retrieved without further airway compromises. Placement of airway tube exchanger into the tracheal lumen of double-lumen tube is a potential contributing factor of the unusual complication. We suggest an exchange catheter be inserted into the bronchial lumen in optimal depth with the adjunct of video laryngoscope, as the safe method for double-lumen tube exchange.","Wu, Hsiang-Ling; Tai, Ying-Hsuan; Wei, Ling-Fang; Cheng, Hung-Wei; Ho, Chiu-Ming",Journal of thoracic disease,221,0

MAIN METHODS Male C57BL/6N mice received a single injection of TMT (2.4 mg/kg, i.p.), and mice were treated with rottlerin after a peak time (i.e., 2 d post-TMT) of convulsive behaviors and apoptotic cell death (5.0 mg/kg, i.p. at 3 and 4 d after TMT injection). Object location test and tail suspension test were performed at 5 d after TMT injection. In addition, changes in the expression of apoptotic and neurogenic markers in the dentate gyrus were examined. KEY FINDINGS Late- and post-ictal treatment with rottlerin suppressed delayed neuronal apoptosis in the dentate gyrus, and attenuated memory impairments (as evaluated by object location test) and depression-like behaviors (as evaluated by tail suspension test) at 5 days after TMT injection in mice. In addition, rottlerin enhanced the expression of Sox2 and DCX, and facilitated p-ERK expression in BrdU-incorporated cells in the dentate gyrus of TMT-treated mice. Rottlerin also increased p-Akt expression, and attenuated the increase in the ratio of pro-apoptotic factors/anti-apoptotic factors, and consequent cytosolic cytochrome c release and caspase-3 cleavage. Rottlerin-mediated action was significantly reversed by SL327, an ERK inhibitor. SIGNIFICANCE Our results suggest that late- and post-ictal treatment with rottlerin attenuates TMT-induced delayed neuronal apoptosis in the dentate gyrus of mice via promotion of neurogenesis and inhibition of an on-going apoptotic process through up-regulation of p-ERK.","Hwang, Yeonggwang; Kim, Hyoung-Chun; Shin, Eun-Joo",Life sciences,221,28

It is believed that SBC development is strongly associated with an individual's bone growth and/or bone microstructure impairment. Current methods of SBC treatment include pharmacological treatment or surgical procedures which may allow the bone within the cyst to rebuild and be restored to properly developed bone tissue. Thus, we propose filling the SBCs with a 3D complex of alginate hydrogel and autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs). We have observed at the in vitro level, that this hydrogel complex induces osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potential through the upregulation of bone morphogenetic protein, osteopontin, collagen type I and aggrecan mRNA levels. Moreover, we detected the creation of a 3D extracellular matrix (EM). To investigate the complex in vivo, we chose 8 horses of varying age suffering from SBC, which resulted in lameness, to undergo experimental surgery. We documented the horses' clinical appearance, lameness and radiographic appearance, to determine that there was clinical improvement in 87.75% of the patients (n=7, out of 8 horses) 6 months postoperatively and 100% (n=8, out of 8 horses) a year after surgery. These results are promising for the potential of this procedure to become the standard in SBC treatment.","Golonka, P; Szklarz, M; Kusz, M; Marędziak, M; Irwin Houston, J M; Marycz, K",Polish journal of veterinary sciences,221,8

We synthesized evidence from these studies to inform mathematical modelling of the prevention cascade for oral and long-acting PrEP in the setting of western Kenya, one of the world's most heavily HIV-affected regions. METHODS We incorporated steps of the PrEP prevention cascade - uptake, adherence, retention and re-engagement after discontinuation - into EMOD-HIV, an open-source transmission model calibrated to the demography and HIV epidemic patterns of western Kenya. Early PrEP implementation research from East Africa was used to parameterize prevention cascades for oral PrEP as currently implemented, delivery innovations for oral PrEP, and future long-acting PrEP. We compared infections averted by PrEP at the population level for different cascade assumptions and sub-populations on PrEP. Analyses were conducted over the 2020 to 2040 time horizon, with additional sensitivity analyses for the time horizon of analysis and the time when long-acting PrEP becomes available. RESULTS The maximum impact of oral PrEP diminished by over 98% across all prevention cascades, with the exception of long-acting PrEP under optimistic assumptions about uptake and re-engagement after discontinuation. Long-acting PrEP had the highest population-level impact, even after accounting for possible delays in product availability, primarily because its effectiveness does not depend on drug adherence. Retention was the most significant cascade step reducing the potential impact of long-acting PrEP. These results were robust to assumptions about the sub-populations receiving PrEP, but were highly influenced by assumptions about re-initiation of PrEP after discontinuation, about which evidence was sparse. CONCLUSIONS Implementation challenges along the prevention cascade compound to diminish the population-level impact of oral PrEP. Long-acting PrEP is expected to be less impacted by user uptake and adherence, but it is instead dependent on product availability in the short term and retention in the long term. To maximize the impact of long-acting PrEP, ensuring timely product approval and rollout is critical. Research is needed on strategies to improve retention and patterns of PrEP re-initiation.","Bershteyn, Anna; Sharma, Monisha; Akullian, Adam N; Peebles, Kathryn; Sarkar, Supriya; Braithwaite, R Scott; Mudimu, Edinah",Journal of the International AIDS Society,221,12

Mobile technology-based prevention and treatment interventions have been used to monitor and transform outcomes across a myriad of health conditions, but their potential in long-term injury recovery is unexplored. The goal of this pilot study was to assess the acceptability and feasibility of mobile health monitoring for long-term outcomes in a population of trauma patients with known barriers to health and social care after injury. Methods We re-recruited 25 individuals, 12-36 months after acute hospitalization, from a recently concluded study of psychological outcomes in seriously injured Black men in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This mixed- methods pilot study was conducted in three phases: (I) qualitative interviews and development of a pilot monitoring platform; (II) a 3-month feasibility trial of mobile monitoring of patient-reported outcomes and biometric data using a wrist-worn commercial fitness monitor (n=18); (III) post-implementation qualitative interviews. Results Analysis of data from pre-implementation interviews indicated that the majority of participants used smartphones as a primary means of communicating with their social network and to access the internet. The 90-day pilot trial of mobile monitoring indicated participants' preference text-delivered communication and survey elicitation. Response rates for 12 automated surveys ranged from 84-92%. Twenty-four hours a day adherence to optional biometric monitoring was generally lower than 50% but ranged widely indicating both very low adherence and very high adherence. Four of 25 participants, 2 who had opted for Fitbit monitoring, were lost to follow-up at the end of the 90-day pilot trial. In post-implementation assessments, participants endorsed the acceptability of mobile monitoring highlighting the benefit of its convenience and flexibility over in-person outcome monitoring. Participants also perceived its potential benefit in long-term engagement with health and social services to assist with the challenges they faced when attempting to achieve physical, psychological, social, and financial recovery after hospitalization. These findings were reinforced through qualitative interviews which highlighted, in addition to acceptability, the perceived value of self-monitoring through the use of wearable devices to track health data like physical activity and sleep. Conclusions This study indicates the feasibility and acceptability of mobile health monitoring used to examine long-term injury sequalae. Future research may leverage this novel strategy, refining its application to address current limitations in the reliability and accuracy of commercially available wearable technology, relative costs and benefits of different mobile data collection strategies, integration within current clinical paradigms and generalizability across injured populations and socio-ecological environments.","Jacoby, Sara F; Robinson, Andrew J; Webster, Jessica L; Morrison, Christopher N; Richmond, Therese S",mHealth,221,28

Respiratory causes are implicated in SUDEP. We reported that ictal hypoxemia occurs in one-third of seizures in localization-related epilepsy. We now report on respiratory changes in the ictal/postictal period including changes in end-tidal CO₂ (ETCO₂) that correlate directly with alveolar CO(2) , allowing a precise evaluation of seizure-related respiratory disturbances. METHODS One hundred eighty-seven seizures were recorded in 33 patients with localization-related epilepsy, with or without secondarily generalized convulsions, undergoing video-electroencephalography (EEG) telemetry with recording of respiratory data. RESULTS The ictal/postictal ETCO₂ increase from baseline was 14 ± 11 mm Hg (11, -1 to 50) [mean ± standard deviation (SD) (median, range)]. ETCO₂ peak was at or above 50 mm Hg with 35 of 94 seizures, 60 mm Hg with 15, and 70 mm Hg with five seizures. Eleven of the 33 patients had seizures with ETCO₂ elevation above 50 mm Hg. The duration of ictal/postictal ETCO(2) increase above baseline was 424 ± 807 s (154, 4 to 6225). The duration of ictal apnea was 49 ± 46 s (31, 6-222); most ictal apneic events were central. Oxygen desaturation to 60% or less occurred with 10 seizures, including five that did not progress to generalized convulsions. Respiratory rate and amplitude increased postictally. The peak ictal ETCO₂ change and duration of change were not associated with apnea duration or seizure duration. Peak ETCO₂ change was significantly associated with contralateral seizure spread. CONCLUSIONS Severe and prolonged increases in ETCO₂ occur with seizures. Postictally, respiratory effort is not impaired. Ictally triggered ventilation-perfusion inequality from pulmonary shunting or transient neurogenic pulmonary edema may account for these findings.","Seyal, Masud; Bateman, Lisa M; Albertson, Timothy E; Lin, Tzu-Chun; Li, Chin-Shang",Epilepsia,221,1

In this study, a newly developed transoral pretilted circular anvil, a ""the oral to the abdomen"" method, was proven to be effective. METHOD A total of 34 consecutive patients underwent esophageal anastomosis using the OrVil in our hospital from July 2009 to February 2011. The esophagus was transected and a small hole was then made in the esophageal stump through which the nasogastric tube of the OrVil was passed to insert the anvil into the abdominal cavity. After fixation with a stapler and a glove at the jejunal loop or the remnant stomach, the abdominal cavity was entered through the minilaparotomy. Pneumoperitoneum and airtightness were reestablished after the glove edge was turned over to seal off the protector. Eventually, intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy or esophagogastrostomy was accomplished under the guidance of laparoscopy. RESULTS There were 34 patients in the study: 1 with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, 7 with stromal tumors in cardia, 23 with adenocarcinoma in the stomach, and 3 with cardia adenocarcinoma involving the lower esophagus. The surgical margins for all tumor patients were negative for tumor cells. The mean operative time was 175.0 minutes (90 to 240 min) and the mean intraoperative blood loss was 195.6 mL (50 to 800 mL). The 34 patients underwent successful laparoscopic surgeries with no open conversions. For 32 patients, there were no technological complications in the transoral insertion of the anvil to the esophageal stump. There were no anastomotic leaks after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS The use of the OrVil device, a ""the oral to the abdomen"" method, changes the direction of the anvil insertion and significantly decreases both difficulty and duration of the laparoscopic surgery. More importantly, if the mass is at a higher position, this approach can achieve a higher surgical margin compared with the hand-sewn purse-string suture technique, thus avoiding the need to undergo a thoracotomy (Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/SLE/A83).","Chong-Wei, Ke; Dan-Lei, Chen; Dan, Ding","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",221,5

However, teachers find it challenging to implement such programs due to overcrowded curricula. Integrating nutrition with core subjects such as mathematics could potentially address time constraints and improve the learning of both. The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the impact of a cross-curricular nutrition and mathematics program on primary school students' portion size estimation skills. Secondary aims include impact on their nutrition knowledge, attitudes towards mathematics and evaluating the quality of the lessons. METHODS Twelve Year 3-4 classes from Catholic schools in New South Wales, Australia will be randomised to intervention (n = 6) or control (n = 6) groups. Teachers in the intervention group will receive a professional development workshop and resources to teach 4-5 lessons on portion size and measurements across 1-4 weeks. Outcome measures include portion size estimation skills, nutrition knowledge and attitudes towards mathematics, with data collected during three school visits (pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, 4 weeks post-intervention). Additionally, teaching quality will be assessed in both intervention and control groups and process evaluation undertaken using teacher interviews and student focus groups.

We sought to investigate pulmonary hemodynamics and ventilation properties in patients with CARDS compared to patients with ARDS of pulmonary origin. METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from consecutive adults with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 patients treated in our ICU in 04/2020 and a comparison of the data to matched controls with ARDS due to respiratory infections treated in our ICU from 01/2014 to 08/2019 for whom pulmonary artery catheter data were available. RESULTS CARDS patients (n = 10) had ventilation characteristics similar to those of ARDS (n = 10) patients. Nevertheless, mechanical power applied by ventilation was significantly higher in CARDS patients (23.4 ± 8.9 J/min) than in ARDS (15.9 ± 4.3 J/min; P < 0.05). COVID-19 patients had similar pulmonary artery pressure but significantly lower pulmonary vascular resistance, as cardiac output was higher in CARDS vs. ARDS patients (P < 0.05). Shunt fraction and dead space were similar in CARDS compared to ARDS (P > 0.05) and were correlated with hypoxemia in both groups. The arteriovenous pCO2 difference (▵pCO2) was elevated (CARDS 5.5 ± 2.8 mmHg vs. ARDS 4.7 ± 1.1 mmHg; P > 0.05), as was the P(v-a)CO2/C(a-v)O2 ratio (CARDS mean 2.2 ± 1.5 vs. ARDS 1.7 ± 0.8; P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients seems to differ only slightly from ARDS regarding ventilation characteristics and pulmonary hemodynamics. Our data indicate microcirculatory dysfunction. More data need to be collected to assure these findings and gain more pathophysiological insights into COVID-19 and respiratory failure.","Becker, André; Seiler, Frederik; Muellenbach, Ralf M; Danziger, Guy; Kamphorst, Maren; Lotz, Christopher; Bals, Robert; Lepper, Philipp M",Journal of intensive care medicine,221,30

Wounds should be assessed for necrosis and infection, which need to be addressed prior to selecting an ideal dressing. Moisture-retentive dressings include films, hydrogels, hydrocolloids, foams, alginates, and hydrofibers and are useful in a variety of clinical settings. Antimicrobial-impregnated dressings can be useful in wounds that are superficially infected or are at higher risk for infection. For refractory wounds that need more growth stimulation, tissue-engineered dressings have become a viable option in the past few decades, especially those that have been approved for burns, venous ulcers, and diabetic ulcers. As wounds heal, the ideal dressing type may change, depending on the amount of exudate and depth of the wound; thus success in wound dressing selection hinges on recognition of the changing healing environment.","Broussard, Karen C; Powers, Jennifer Gloeckner",American journal of clinical dermatology,221,1

While tDCS has shown potential for improving cognitive functions in healthy older adults, stimulation outcomes on various cognitive domains have been mixed. Methods A systematic search was performed in four databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsychInfo. Search results were then screened for eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion criteria to only include studies where tDCS was applied to improve cognition in healthy older adults 65 years and above. Eligible studies were reviewed and demographic characteristics, tDCS dose parameters, study procedures, and cognitive outcomes were extracted. Reported effect sizes for active compared to sham group in representative cognitive domain were converted to Hedges' g. Main Results A total of thirteen studies involving healthy older adults (n=532, mean age=71.2+5.3 years) were included in the meta-analysis. The majority of included studies (94%) targeted the prefrontal cortex with stimulation intensity 1-2 mA using various electrode placements with anodes near the frontal region. Across all studies, we found Hedges' g values ranged from -0.31 to 1.85 as reported group effect sizes of active stimulation compared to sham. Conclusion While observed outcomes varied, overall findings indicated promising effects of tDCS to remediate cognitive aging and thus deserves further exploration. Future characterization of inter-individual variability in tDCS dose response and applications in larger cohorts are warranted to further validate benefits of tDCS for cognition in healthy older adults.","Indahlastari, Aprinda; Hardcastle, Cheshire; Albizu, Alejandro; Alvarez-Alvarado, Stacey; Boutzoukas, Emanuel M; Evangelista, Nicole D; Hausman, Hanna K; Kraft, Jessica; Langer, Kailey; Woods, Adam J",Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,221,1

Since viral propagation completely depends on the host translational machinery, many viruses have evolved to circumvent the induction of SGs or co-opt SG components. In this study, we found that expression of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) core protein inhibits SG formation. Caprin-1 was identified as a binding partner of the core protein by an affinity capture mass spectrometry analysis. Alanine scanning mutagenesis revealed that Lys(97) and Arg(98) in the α-helix of the JEV core protein play a crucial role in the interaction with Caprin-1. In cells infected with a mutant JEV in which Lys(97) and Arg(98) were replaced with alanines in the core protein, the inhibition of SG formation was abrogated, and viral propagation was impaired. Furthermore, the mutant JEV exhibited attenuated virulence in mice. These results suggest that the JEV core protein circumvents translational shutoff by inhibiting SG formation through an interaction with Caprin-1 and facilitates viral propagation in vitro and in vivo.","Katoh, Hiroshi; Okamoto, Toru; Fukuhara, Takasuke; Kambara, Hiroto; Morita, Eiji; Mori, Yoshio; Kamitani, Wataru; Matsuura, Yoshiharu",Journal of virology,221,16

Strict adherence to preventive measures reduces the risk of VAP. The objective of this paper is to review what has come forward in recent years in the nonpharmacological prevention of VAP. RECENT FINDINGS It seems advantageous to implement care bundles rather than single prevention measures. A solid basis of knowledge seems necessary to facilitate implementation and maintain a high adherence level. Continuous educational efforts have a beneficial effect on attitude toward VAP. Intermittent subglottic secretions drainage, continuous lateral rotation therapy, and polyurethane cuffed endotracheal tubes decrease the risk of pneumonia. In an in-vitro setting, an endotracheal tube with a taper-shaped cuff appears to better prevent fluid leakage compared to cylindrical polyurethane or polyvinylchloride cuffed tubes. Cuff pressure control by means of an automatic device and multimodality chest physiotherapy need further investigation, as do some aspects of oral hygiene. SUMMARY New devices and strategies have been developed to prevent VAP. Some of these are promising but need further study. In addition, more attention is being given to factors that might facilitate the implementation process and the challenge of achieving high adherence rates.","Blot, Stijn; Rello, Jordi; Vogelaers, Dirk",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,221,12

METHODS We performed clinical, electrophysiological, MRI and muscle pathology studies in four SOD1 p.D12Y variant positive patients. RESULTS SOD1 p.D12Y clinical manifestations ranged from a benign phenotype characterized by distal distribution of muscular weakness and long survival to classic forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with poor prognosis. Two patients with the distal clinical phenotype showed MRI and muscle pathology alterations indicating a concurrent muscle involvement. In one of these patients significant myopathic changes were associated with rimmed vacuolar pathology. CONCLUSIONS We expand the clinical spectrum of SOD1 p.D12Y variant, including predominant lower motor neuron forms with long survival and classic forms with aggressive course. Some patients may have concomitant distal myopathy without other explanations. Given clinical, MRI and muscle pathology alterations SOD1 should be considered in the differential diagnosis of molecularly undefined distal myopathies with rimmed vacuoles.","Tasca, Giorgio; Lattante, Serena; Marangi, Giuseppe; Conte, Amelia; Bernardo, Daniela; Bisogni, Giulia; Mandich, Paola; Zollino, Marcella; Ragozzino, Elvira; Udd, Bjarne; Sabatelli, Mario",European journal of neurology,221,1

METHODS Prospective cohort study of all children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit at a university-affiliated hospital with severe TBI over a 4-year period to study three different methods of monitoring cerebral autoregulation: pressure-reactivity index (PRx), transcranial Doppler derived mean flow velocity index (Mx), and near-infrared spectroscopy derived cerebral oximetry index (COx). RESULTS Twelve patients were included in the study, aged 5 months to 17 years old. An empirical regression analyzing dependence of PRx on cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) displayed the classic U-shaped distribution, with low PRx values (< 0.3) reflecting intact auto-regulation, within the CPP range of 50-100 mmHg. The optimal CPP was 75-80 mmHg for PRx and COx. The correlation coefficients between the three indices were as follows: PRx vs Mx, r = 0.56; p < 0.0001; PRx vs COx, r = 0.16; p < 0.0001; and COx vs Mx, r = 0.15; p = 0.022. The mean PRx with a cutoff value of 0.3 predicted correctly long-term outcome (p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS PRx seems to be the most robust index to access cerebrovascular reactivity in children with TBI and has promising prognostic value. Optimal CPP calculation is feasible with PRx and COx.","Abecasis, Francisco; Dias, Celeste; Zakrzewska, Agnieszka; Oliveira, Vitor; Czosnyka, Marek",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,221,1

As the obesity epidemic continues to rise in adolescence, it becomes imperative to understand developmentally appropriate eating behaviours and to create weight management strategies that build on those innate patterns and preferences. The purpose of this study was to determine the most common habitual eating windows observed in adolescents with obesity. METHODS Participants were 101 Hispanic adolescents (mean age 14.8 ± 2.1 years; 48 male/53 female) with obesity (BMI ≥95th percentile) who were recruited as part of a larger clinical trial. Dietary intake and meal timing was determined using multiple pass 24-hours recalls. Histograms were utilized to determine the natural distribution of percent consumption of total kilocalories, carbohydrates and added sugar per hour. RESULTS The majority of total kilocalories (65.4%), carbohydrates (65.3%) and added sugar (59.1%) occurred between 11:00 and 19:00. Adolescents were 2.5 to 2.9 times more likely to consume kilocalories, carbohydrates, and added sugar during the 8-hour window between 11:00 am and 19:00 pm than other time windows examined (all P < .001). The consumption of these calories did not differ between weekdays and weekend (P > .05) or by sex. CONCLUSIONS In this cohort, more than 60% of calories, carbohydrates and added sugar were consumed between 11:00 am and 19:00 pm, which is concordant with an afternoon/evening chronotype that is common in adolescents. Our findings support this 8-hour period as a practical window for weight loss interventions that target pre-specified eating periods in this population.","Vidmar, Alaina P; Jones, Roshonda B; Wee, Choo Phei; Berger, Paige K; Plows, Jasmine F; Claudia Rios, R D; Raymond, Jennifer K; Goran, Michael I",Pediatric obesity,221,28

Our aim was to assess whether bone-subtraction CTA is capable of guiding treatment for cerebral aneurysms in patients with acute SAH and could replace DSA. MATERIALS AND METHODS We prospectively studied 116 consecutive patients with SAH with 16-detector row bone-subtraction CTA and DSA before intracranial aneurysm treatment. Two independent neuroradiologists reviewed the bone-subtraction CTA blinded to DSA (reference standard). We determined the accuracy of bone-subtraction CTA for aneurysm detection and the measurement of aneurysm dimensions and compared the radiation doses of the 2 imaging modalities. RESULTS Seventy-one patients (61%) had 74 aneurysms on DSA. Bone-subtraction CTA detected 73 of these aneurysms, but it detected 1 additional aneurysm. On a per-aneurysm basis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for bone-subtraction CTA were 99%, 98%, and 99% and 98%, respectively. For aneurysms of ≤3 mm, sensitivity was 94% (95% CI, 73%-99%). Bone-subtraction CTA slightly overestimated neck and dome diameters by <0.2 mm and overestimated the dome-to-neck ratios by 2% on average. Dose-length product was 565 ± 201 mGy × cm for bone-subtraction CTA and 1609 ± 1300 mGy × cm for DSA. CONCLUSIONS Bone-subtraction CTA is as accurate as DSA in detecting cerebral aneurysms after SAH, provides similar information about aneurysm configuration and measures, and reduces the average effective radiation dose for vascular diagnostics by 65%. Diagnostic equivalence in association with dose reduction suggests replacing DSA with bone-subtraction CTA in the diagnostic work-up of spontaneous SAH.","Aulbach, P; Mucha, D; Engellandt, K; Hädrich, K; Kuhn, M; von Kummer, R",AJNR.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the indications, treatment strategies, and surgical outcomes of patients who underwent a revisional surgery after a failed LSG. METHODS This retrospective study included the outcomes of 32 patients who required a revisional surgery from a series of 500 primary LSGs. The patients' demographic data, indications for revisional surgery, perioperative complications, and postoperative outcomes were recorded. RESULTS A total of 500 patients underwent primary LSGs during the study period, and 32 of these patients were subjected to revisional bariatric surgery after a failed LSG. Weight regain, poor weight loss, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) were the most common causes of revision. A revisional LSG (r-LSG) was performed in 23 patients, while 9 patients received a revisional laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (r-LRYGB). There were complete sleeve pouch dilations in 10 patients. A residual fundus and antrum dilation was detected in 5 and 8 patients, respectively. The r-LRYGB procedure was performed for GERD-related symptoms in 6 patients and 3 other patients underwent r-LRYGB due to the intake of high-caloric foods. The mean operative time, length of hospital stay, and complication rates of revisional surgeries were significantly higher than the total cohort. CONCLUSIONS Although r-LSG and r-LRYGB seem to be safe and effective treatment options after a failed LSG, revisional procedures were associated with an increased complication rate.

Susceptibility of subjects with low magnesium status to develop and enhance this infection is possible. There is little data on the magnesium status of patients with Covid-19 with different degrees of severity. This study was conducted to evaluate prevalence of dysmagnesemia in a prospective Covid-19 cohort study according to the severity of the clinical manifestations and to identify factors associated. Serum magnesium was measured in 300 of 549 patients admitted to the hospital due to severe Covid-19. According to the WHO guidelines, patients were classified as moderate, severe, or critical. 48% patients had a magnesemia below 0.75 mmol/L (defined as magnesium deficiency) including 13% with a marked hypomagnesemia (<0.65 mmol/L). 9.6% had values equal to or higher than 0.95 mmol/L. Serum magnesium concentrations were significantly lower in female than in male (0.73 ± 0.12 vs 0.80 ± 0.13 mmol/L), whereas the sex ratio M/F was higher in severe and critical form (p<0.001).

STUDY SELECTION Search phrases were ""laparoscopic liver resection,"" ""open liver resection,"" ""versus,"" ""compared with,"" and ""advantages."" DATA EXTRACTION Thirty-one studies were reviewed that directly compared laparoscopic with open hepatic resection in 2473 patients. DATA SYNTHESIS In case-cohort matched studies, and our institutional series, laparoscopic liver resection was associated with less blood loss, quicker resumption of oral diet, less pain medication requirement, and shorter length of stay, with no difference in complication rates. In those patients undergoing laparoscopic hepatic resection for malignancy, there was no difference in 3- or 5-year overall survival when compared with well-matched open hepatic resection cases. Financially, the total hospital costs of laparoscopic liver resection were either offset or improved because of a shorter length of stay. CONCLUSIONS Based on review of the literature and our institutional series, minimally invasive hepatic resection for benign and malignant liver lesions is safe and feasible with significant benefits for patients consisting of less blood loss, less narcotic requirements, and shorter length of hospital stay. There are no economic disadvantages to the laparoscopic approach, and case-cohort matched studies show no difference in oncologic outcomes between the laparoscopic and open groups.","Nguyen, Kevin Tri; Marsh, J Wallis; Tsung, Allan; Steel, J Jennifer L; Gamblin, T Clark; Geller, David A",Archives of surgery,221,16

However, there is a paucity of data on treatment durability and long-term outcomes. OBJECTIVES To provide long-term data on patients with a complete response to IL-2 therapy for ITM. METHODS Consecutive patients with ITM, treated with intralesional IL-2 therapy, at the Tom Baker Cancer Center were identified from April 2009 to August 2019. All patients received at least 4 cycles (every 2 weeks) of IL-2 (5 MIU/mL). Complete response was defined as sustained (ie, 3 months) clinical complete remission of all known in-transit disease. RESULTS Sixty-five patients were treated with curative intent for in-transit disease with intralesional IL-2. Complete clinical response was identified in 44.6% (29/65). In this subset of patients, the median number of lesions per patient was 9 (range 1-40). The median total dose of IL-2 was 0.8 mL (IQR 0.4-1.5) per lesion. One patient received isolated limb infusion and 13.8% (4/29) received systemic immunotherapy as part of their initial management. At a median follow-up of 27 months (IQR 16-59), 34.5% (10/29) developed recurrent disease. Of these patients, 50.0% (5/10) presented with synchronous in-transit and distant metastases. The median time to recurrence was 10.5 months (IQR 5.8-16.3). CONCLUSION With long-term follow-up, 65.5% of complete responders have a durable response to intralesional IL-2 therapy. In this cohort of patients, local in-transit recurrence is most likely to occur within 12 months and is often associated with concomitant distant disease.","Khoury, Sami; Knapp, Gregory C; Fyfe, Allison; Monzon, Jose; Temple-Oberle, Claire; McKinnon, Gregory J",Journal of cutaneous medicine and surgery,221,1

A validated food-frequency questionnaire was used to estimate the participants' usual diet and to assess dietary intakes of various nutrients, including energy, BCAAs and calcium. Odds ratio (ORs) and corresponding confidence intervals (CI) were computed by multiple logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex and other confounding factors, including total energy intake.BCAA intake was inversely related to CRC risk (OR for the highest versus the lowest quintile, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.97), but the association was attenuated after adjustment for calcium intake (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.65-1.25). A linear inverse association with sigmoid colon cancer risk remained also after adjustment for other dietary factors, including calcium intake (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27-0.87).This study provides supporting evidence that higher levels of dietary BCAA intake are not associated with an increase of CRC risk, but confirms that they may be related to a reduced risk of sigmoid colon cancer.","Rossi, Marta; Mascaretti, Federica; Parpinel, Maria; Serraino, Diego; Crispo, Anna; Celentano, Egidio; Giacosa, Attilio; La Vecchia, Carlo",The British journal of nutrition,221,5

Conditions that contribute to violence--poverty, unemployment, lack of available resources, isolation, hopelessness, and loss--have intensified and are further compounded by the recent surge in firearm sales, which is itself a risk factor for firearm-related harm. OBJECTIVE: To describe individuals' worry about violence for themselves and others in the context of the pandemic, pandemic-related unfair treatment, as well as the prevalence of and reasons for firearm acquisition and changes in firearm storage practices due to the pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used data from the California Safety and Wellbeing Survey, a statewide Internet survey of 2,870 California adults (18 years of age and older) conducted from July 14 to July 27, 2020. Responses were weighted to be representative of the state population of adults. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Survey topics for this study included: changes in worry about violence happening to oneself, by type of violence and location, before and during the pandemic; concern someone else might physically hurt another person or themselves on purpose due to a pandemic-related loss; experiences of unfair treatment related to the pandemic; firearm and ammunition acquisition and changes in firearm storage practices due to the pandemic; and participation in civic and political activities ""in response to gun violence"" during the pandemic. RESULTS: Worry about violence significantly increased during the pandemic for all violence types except mass shootings. More than 1 in 10 respondents were concerned that someone they know might intentionally harm another person (12.2%) or themselves (13.1%). Of those concerned about self-harm for someone else, 7.5% said it was because the person had suffered a pandemic-related loss. An estimated 110,000 individuals acquired a firearm in response to the pandemic (2.4% of current firearm owners), including 47,000 new owners. Approximately 55,000 individuals (1.2% of owners) who currently store at least one firearm loaded and not locked up said they had adopted this unsecure storage practice in response to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Given the impulsive nature of many types of violence, short-term crisis interventions, such as options for temporary firearm storage outside the home, extreme risk protection orders, and efforts involving community-based violence intervention workers, may be critical for reducing violence-related harm now and following other societal shocks.","Kravitz-Wirtz, N.; Aubel, A.; Schleimer, J.

In the framework of urban planning of health facilities, the problem consists into optimizing the overall cost of building and running vaccine units with respect to costs and benefit for the public by deciding their size and location. The complex non linear objective function, depends on populations distributions, transportation infrastructure costs, travel times and distances and vaccination units capacities. The problem domain is described by a model based on a layered approach, where the layers embed knowledge of different types at a scalable resolution. Although many purposely designed algorithms for spatial locations assignment of health facilities, have been proposed in the literature, in a pandemics situation, for vaccination units, faster optimization tools are needed not necessarily designed for a specific problem model, which can quickly change dynamically. We have investigated and compared the application of several evolutionary optimization algorithms from PSO to Differential Evolution.

The unprecedented disruption in transportation and stay-at-home orders caused a global disruption in the supply and distribution of drugs that impacted both prescription and illicit drug users. In this study, the trend in consuming 10 major illegal drugs and 19 prescription drugs of potential abuse was determined during the early four months of the COVID-19 pandemic in two communities in western Kentucky and northern Tennessee using wastewater-based epidemiology. The hydrocodone consumption rate increased by 72% (up to 430 mg/d/1000 people) in both communities that aligned with convenient opioid access through teleprescription-approved refills. However, a limited supply and a consequent increase in the cost of drugs significantly curtailed the consumption of illicit stimulants (methamphetamine, 16%;cocaine, 42%). Moreover, the increased use of benzodiazepines and antidepressants suggests elevated community anxiety that overall warrants robust neuropsychiatric screening and treatment programs. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to determine trends in consumption of diverse illicit and prescription drugs during the stay-at-home early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in United States communities. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","Montgomery, A.

Considering the same, this paper intends to investigate the impact of outbreak of epidemic diseases on the stock return (observed through cumulative average abnormal return (CAAR)) for the listed banks in Pakistan from 2011 to 2020. Event study method was employed and five days pre and ten days post event of each disease were observed as an event window. The results confirm that none of the epidemic disease outbreak significantly determines the CAAR for all listed banks, except COVID-19 and Dengue Fever during the event day. There is a negative and significant impact of COVID-19 on the stock returns for all the banks in Pakistan from the event day to day eight except day seven. More specifically, COVID-19 is found to be a significant indicator for the stock returns of private banks. However, in case of public listed banks, only the outbreak of HIV cases possesses significant and positive impact on CAAR at the day of event. These findings would guide all stakeholders such as investors, financial analysts, regulators, and chief risk officers specifically in banks to make strategic decisions while analyzing the relationship between epidemic outbreaks and stock returns. © 2021 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 57 active, public library Twitter accounts were used for data collection and analysis. The tweets examined were a combination of original tweets (n = 1,465) and retweets (n = 516) posted from other Twitter accounts on the public libraries’ Twitter feeds. A content analysis scheme was developed to analyse topical aspects of the tweets. Findings: The most frequent tweets were about library events, programmes and activities. However, there was a relatively low focus on sharing community information and addressing information related to the pandemic. The study suggests that public libraries could use Twitter to provide library resources and services to their patrons, whilst also acting as a virtual community centre safely keeping patrons engaged in the face of a global pandemic. By doing so, Twitter could be used as an integral part of promoting the mission of public libraries. Research limitations/implications: The study examined a limited number of public libraries’ Twitter posts. Whilst the study carried out a random sampling of 10% of public libraries from the five states that had the highest COVID-19 cases in the month of April 2020, the study only examined tweets of 57 public libraries being active in posting. Thus, the findings of the study are not for generalizing. Practical implications: The content scheme includes content types regarding library services and community information. The content category scheme is general to reflect themes of content during a normal time and any emergency. Thus, this framework could be helpful for the content development of public libraries in planning social media use. Originality/value: The study used a new content analysis framework to examine both original tweets and retweets for information sharing of library services and community information. The approach of content analysis is distinctive to examine libraries’ communication trends on social media not only in normal times but also in times of crisis as well.

Due to a continuously changing pandemic landscape, robustness becomes a crucial additional requirement for the score. Patients and methodsIn this research, real-world data collected within the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic was used. The first wave data (1349 cases collected from 27.04.2020 to 03.08.2020) was used as a training set for the score development, while the second wave data (1453 cases collected from 01.11.2020 to 19.01.2021) was used as a validating set. For all the available patients features we tested their association with an outcome using robust linear regression. Statistically significant features were taken to the further analysis for each of which their partial sensitivity, specificity and promptness were estimated. The sensitivity and the specificity were further combined into a feature informativeness index. ResultsThe developed score was derived as a weighted sum of the following 9 features showed the best trade-off between informativeness and promptness: APTT (> 42 sec, 4 points), CRP (> 146 mg/L, 3 points), D-dimer (> 2149 mkg/L, 4 points), Glucose (> 9 mmol/L, 4 points), Hemoglobin (< 115 g/L, 3 points), Lymphocytes (< 0,7*10^9/L, 3 points), Total protein (< 61 g/L, 6 points), Urea (> 11 mmol/L, 5 points) and WBC (> 13,5*10^9/L, 4 points). Thus, the proposed score ranges between 0 and 36 points. Internal and temporal validation showed that sensitivity and specificity over 90% may be achieved with an expected prediction range >7 days. Moreover, we demonstrated a high robustness of the score to the varying peculiarities of the pandemic. For the additional simplicity of application we split the full range of the score into five grades delimited with 9, 14, 19 and 24 points which determine expected death:discharge odds 1:100, 1:25, 1:5 and 1:1 correspondingly. ConclusionsAn extensive application of the score within the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic showed its potential for the optimization of patients management as well as improvement of medical staff attentiveness during high workload stress. The transparent structure of the score, as well as tractable cut-off bounds, simplified its implementation into clinical practice.","Bakin, Evgeny A.; Stanevich, Oksana V.; Belash, Vasiliy A.; Belash, Anastasia A.; Savvateeva, Galina A.; Bokinova, Veronika A.; Arsentieva, Natalia A.; Sayenko, Ludmila F.; Korobenkov, Evgeny A.; Lioznov, Dmitry A.; Totolian, Areg A.; Polushin, Yury S.; Kulikov, Alexander N.",,221,16

Several computational approaches have been recently developed to identify A-to-I RNA editing sites from sequencing data, each addressing a particular issue. Here we present RESIC, an efficient pipeline that combines several approaches for the detection and classification of RNA editing sites. The pipeline can be used for all organisms and can use any number of RNA-sequencing datasets as input. RESIC provides 1. The detection of editing sites in both repetitive and non-repetitive genomic regions; 2. The identification of hyper-edited regions; 3. Optional exclusion of polymorphism sites to increase reliability, based on DNA, and ADAR-mutant RNA sequencing datasets, or SNP databases. We demonstrate the utility of RESIC by applying it to human, successfully overlapping and extending the list of known putative editing sites. We further tested changes in the patterns of A-to-I RNA editing, and RNA abundance of ADAR enzymes, following SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cell lines. Our results suggest that upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to mock, the number of hyper editing sites is increased, and in agreement, the activity of ADAR1, which catalyzes hyper-editing, is enhanced. These results imply the involvement of A-to-I RNA editing in conceiving the unpredicted phenotype of COVID-19 disease. RESIC code is open-source and is easily extendable.","Light, Dean; Haas, Roni; Yazbak, Mahmoud; Elfand, Tal; Blau, Tal; Lamm, Ayelet T.",bioRxiv,221,1

This may lead to long-term psychological consequences if left unchecked. Aims and Objectives: This study aimed to determine the level of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young adults (18–30 years) and to find the difference in psychological impact according to gender, residence, and employment. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted between May 2020 and June 2020. An online survey was conducted using two validated questionnaires – Impact of Event Scale-Revised and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. These two validated questionnaires assess the post-traumatic stress (PTS), depression, anxiety, and stress among the respondents. The data obtained were statistically analyzed in GraphPad Prism 6.01. Results: A total of 111 (male 54 and female 57) research participants provided full responses. A fair number (21.62%) of participants had PTS. A total of 48 (43.24%) had moderate-to-severe stress. Sixty-three (56.75%) had extremely severe anxiety and 18 (16.21%) had moderate-to-severe anxiety. Twenty-three (20.72%) participants showed extremely severe depression and 25 (22.52%) had moderate-to-severe depression. Females showed higher levels of anxiety and depression than males. However, there was no difference in anxiety and depression among the urban and rural populations. PTS and anxiety among employed respondents were higher than non-employed respondents. Conclusion: We found a high level of anxiety and depression among them. Female young adults of both rural and urban areas are more vulnerable to anxiety and stress.

While ongoing research has illustrated the unequal impact of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on minority populations, research in this area has been unable to fully explain the mechanisms that produce these findings. To understand why some groups have been at greater risk of contracting COVID-19, we employ structural inequality theory to better understand how inequality may impact disease transmission in a pandemic. We used a novel approach that enabled us to focus on the microprocesses of structural inequality at the zip code level to study the impact of stay-at-home pandemic policies on COVID-19 positive case rates in an urban setting across three periods of policy implementation. We then analyzed data on traffic volume, income, race, occupation, and instances of COVID-19 positive cases for each zip code in Salt Lake County, Utah (USA) between 17 February 2020 and 12 June 2020. We found that higher income, percent white, and white-collar zip codes had a greater response to the local stay-at-home order and reduced vehicular traffic by nearly 50% during lockdown. The least affluent zip codes only showed a 15% traffic decrease and had COVID-19 rates nearly 10 times higher. At this level of granularity, income and occupation were both associated with COVID-19 outcomes across all three stages of policy implementation, while race was only predictive of outcomes after the lockdown period. Our findings illuminate underlying mechanisms of structural inequality that may have facilitated unequal COVID-19 incidence rates. This study illustrates the need for more granular analyses in policy research and adds to the literature on how structural factors such as income, race, and occupation contribute to disease transmission in a pandemic.","Mendoza, Daniel L.; Benney, Tabitha M.; Ganguli, Rajive Pothina Rambabu Pirozzi Cheryl S.; Quackenbush, Cameron Baty Samuel R.; Crosman, Erik T.; Zhang, Yue",COVID,221,1

However, the COVID-19-pandemic led to unprecedented restrictions in social life. The consequences of these social lockdowns on momentary well-being are yet not fully understood. Method: We investigated the individual affective benefit from social interactions in a longitudinal birth cohort study. We used two real-time, real-life ecological momentary assessments once before and once during the initial lockdown of the pandemic (N~6800 total observations) to determine the protective role of social interactions on well-being. Moreover, we used a multimethod approach combining the ecological assessment data with individual risk and resilience factors to analyze the moderating mechanisms of personality, neurobiology and genes. Results: Social contacts were linked to higher positive affect both during normal times and during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the beneficial role of social embedding. Moreover, this relationship was moderated by amygdala volume, neuroticism and polygenic risk for schizophrenia. In detail, participants with a larger left amygdala volume and higher trait neuroticism exhibited an affective benefit from more social interactions prior to the pandemic. This pattern changed during the pandemic with participants with smaller amygdala volumes and lower neurotic traits showing a social affective gain during the pandemic. Moreover, participants with low genetic risk for schizophrenia showed an affective benefit from social interactions irrespective of the time point.

This can become a favorable ground for the occurrence of dysfunctional breathing. Dysfunctional breathing is a pattern of breathing that does not meet physiological needs and can lead to respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive disorders and neurological dysfunctions (Chaitow et al.,2014)ObjectivesThe aim of the study is to identify “personality predictors” for the occurrence of dysfunctional breathing in the Russian population during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsThe author’s socio-demographic questionnaire, the Naimigen Questionnaire (VanDixhoorn, Duivenvoordent, 1984), HEXACO-PI-R (Ashton, Lee, 2017;Egorova, Psrshikova, Mitina, 2019), and The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 1983;Leonova, 2013) were used. The study was conducted online from April 27 to May 27. 582 people from all regions of Russia attended it, including 496 women and 86 men aged 18 to 64 years.ResultsDysfunctional breathing has a direct correlation with personal anxiety (r=0.543, p=0.000) and emotionality (r=0.370,p=0.000), as well as a negative correlation with the personality traits of Honesty/ Humility(r=-0.153, p=0.000), Extraversion (r=-0.247, p=0.000), Agreeableness (r=-0.226, p=0.000), and Conscientiousness (r=-0.128, p=0.002).ConclusionsThus, in the COVID-19 pandemic context, dysfunctional breathing was detected in people with increased trait anxiety and pronounced emotionality, as well as in people with hostility and low conscientiousness/organization, as well as in introverts and those who are inclined to demonstrate social status. The occurrence of dysfunctional breathing during a pandemic can be interpreted as a sign of coronavirus disease by those people, which can motivate them to seek medical help, and thus increase the burden on the healthcare system.","Koniukhovskaia, J.; Pervichko, E.; Mitina, O.; Stepanova, O.; Dorokhov, E.",European Psychiatry,221,16

The current design of the aerosol containment box is used heavily during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the virus being present in airborne aerosol particles from a patient's breath. However, the current design has been reported to be flawed in its design aspects. Adding ergonomic considerations into the design is expected to provide improved mobility and better usage of medical instruments. The research conducted analyzed how effective the current design in containing the spread of aerosols from the patient. To execute the research, the current design is modelled in a 3D render using SOLIDWORKS 2020 using dimensions to scale. The 3D model is imported into ANSYS 18.2 to conduct an airflow analysis when a patient cough or breathes to analyses the spread of the aerosols from the patient. The patient coughing was simulated using a nozzle with the boundary space of the model based on the size of the intubation box. The key outcome of the project that the present design is not verry effective in containing aerosol spread as there is still airflow of the particles leaving the intubation box into the environment. The improved design of the intubation box prevents flow of the aerosols into the environment by using suction and seals to close of outlets. The data gained from the study of the aerosol spread proves that there is a higher pressure concentration of the aerosols particles on the walls of the outlets in the existing design in the market as compared to the improved design suggested. This data can help better justify the dimensions and criteria needed to further enhance the current design of the aerosol containment box.","Sathian, H.; Noum, S. Y.

To guarantee workers' safety, it could be useful to analyze the influence of the face mask use on physiological parameters during working activities. This paper aims at collecting and comparing both objective and subjective measurements during lifting and moving a light load (3 kg) in two working conditions: with and without a N95 face mask. The recorded physiological measures are the cardiac and respiratory activity, the skin temperature and the muscular activation. They are synchronously collected via an integrated wearable and unobtrusive sensory system. Moreover, the Borg scale is used to estimate the perceived exertion of the participants during the execution of the working activity. The analysis carried out in this work pointed out some statistically significant differences in the physiological measures due to an increased physical workload experimented by the volunteers when wearing the face mask. In addition, the correlation between the Borg scale and the monitored physiological measurements does not change significantly in the two experimented conditions. Moreover, the strong correlation between perceived exertion and physiological parameters demonstrates that the Borg scale remains an excellent method for estimating the level of perceived strain. Finally, even though some physiological differences can occur when wearing a face mask, its usefulness as personal protective equipment remains undisputed. © 2021 IEEE.","Tamantini, C.; Lapresa, M.; Di Luzio, F.

Drawing on a participant-observation ethnography over the 2018–2021 period with environmental defenders on Coast Salish land, in what is colonially called ‘British Columbia, Canada’, this article offers a lens for exploring visual realms of resistance amid expanding extractivism, police surveillance and reconfigured pipeline opposition during the COVID-19 pandemic. Grassroots photography in land-based monitoring, artistic communication in and around courtrooms and other visual practices have been serving as powerful inflection points, countering multiple facets of petro-colonialism – ecological destruction, health threats, and moral and legal transgressions by companies and state institutions. They have also been stimulating new collective actions, some led by Indigenous land protectors extending longstanding traditions of protecting human and non-human life. As ‘more-than-representational’, visual encounters can be active players in constructing knowledge, challenging structures of dispossession, genocide and ecocide, and cultivating understandings of care, sovereignty, climate justice and anti-colonial solidarity from heterogeneous vantage points. Some environmental defenders’ visual creativities invite deep reflection on ontologies rooted in reciprocity and respect that are thoroughly ignored in extractivist settler-colonial cultures. The article situates visual strategies in fraught political contexts of ramped-up police and corporate surveillance targeting Indigenous land protectors and other environmental defenders, underscoring critical concern about superficial optical allyship and hollow gestures by state actors responding to racism and state violence on Indigenous land. It calls for attention to dialectical relationships amongst state visual tactics and counter-hegemonic visual practices in struggles to resist colonial energy regimes and to cultivate efforts towards alternative, less destructive energy futures.","Spiegel, Samuel J.",Energy Research &amp; Social Science,221,9

Despite these impressive findings, however, a key barrier to the full realization of ML's potential in medical prognoses is technology acceptance. Recent efforts to produce explainable AI (XAI) have made progress in improving the interpretability of some ML models, but these efforts suffer from limitations intrinsic to their design: they work best at identifying why a system fails, but do poorly at explaining when and why a model's prediction is correct. We posit that the acceptability of ML predictions in expert domains is limited by two key factors: the machine's horizon of prediction that extends beyond human capability, and the inability for machine predictions to incorporate human intuition into their models. We propose the use of a novel ML architecture, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) to enhance human understanding and encourage acceptability. Our approach prioritizes human cognitive intuition at the center of the algorithm design, and offers a distribution of predictions rather than single outputs. We explain how this approach may significantly improve human-machine collaboration in prediction tasks in expert domains such as medical prognoses. We propose a model and demonstrate, by expanding a concrete example from the literature, how our model advances the vision of future hybrid Human-AI systems.","Fompeyrine, D.; Vorm, E.

While Canada is highly self-reliant in food categories such as meat and dairy, the nation relies heavily on international imports to fulfill fresh vegetable demands. In potential future scenarios where international trade faces disruptions, Canadian food security could be at risk. By providing local sources of fresh foods year-round, the greenhouse vegetable industry holds strong potential to overcome future food supply shortages and could become a critical contributor to self-sustainable food production in Canada. Many challenges, however, surround the Canadian greenhouse industry. Some challenges include the persistence and spread of infectious plant pathogens and forecasted labour shortages. Opportunities to alleviate such challenges include introducing more diverse commodity groups and integrating innovative technologies to accelerate efficiency within the industry.

Social determinants and pre-existing health conditions place homeless people at increased risk of severe disease. Described outbreaks in homeless shelters resulted in high proportions of infected residents and staff members. In addition to other infection prevention strategies, regular shelter-wide (universal) testing for COVID-19 may be valuable, depending on the level of community transmission and when resources permit. MethodsThis was a prospective feasibility cohort study to evaluate universal testing for COVID-19 at a homeless shelter with 106 beds in Berlin, Germany. Co-researchers were recruited from the shelter staff. A PCR analysis of saliva or self-collected nasal/oral swab was performed weekly over a period of 3 weeks in July 2020. Acceptability and implementation barriers were analyzed by process evaluation using mixed methods including evaluation sheets, focus group discussion and a structured questionnaire. ResultsNinety-three out of 124 (75%) residents were approached to participate in the study. Fifty-one out of the 93 residents (54.8%) gave written informed consent. High retention rates (88.9% - 93.6%) of a weekly respiratory specimen were reached, but repeated collection attempts, as well as assistance were required. A self-collected nasal/oral swab was considered easier and more hygienic to collect than a saliva specimen. No resident was tested positive. Language barriers were the main reason for non-participation. Flexibility of sample collection schedules, the use of video and audio materials, and concise written information were the main recommendations of the co-researchers for future implementation. ConclusionVoluntary universal testing for COVID-19 is feasible in homeless shelters. Universal testing of high-risk facilities will require flexible approaches, considering the level of the community transmission, the available resources, and the local recommendations. Lack of human resources and laboratory capacity may be a major barrier for implementation of universal testing, requiring adapted approaches compared to standard individual testing. Assisted self-collection of specimens and barrier free communication may facilitate implementation in homeless shelters.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study comparing the emergency surgery activity in a Spanish tertiary Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic and emergency surgery activity registered in 2019 during the equivalent time period. RESULTS: A total of 1802 patients were included in control group (CG) versus 756 in pandemic group (PG). Mean number of patients who underwent emergency surgery during the control and pandemic periods was 3.42 patients per day, in contrast to 1.62 during the pandemic period, which represents a 52.6% decrease in emergency surgery activity. During the pandemic period, most of the patients consulted after more than 72 h of symptoms, representing a delay in presenting in the ER of 23.7% when compared to CG. Surgeries due to complications from previous elective procedures decreased (12% vs. 6.1%) in PG, probably because elective procedures are being postponed. We had a 13.1% COVID-19 positivity rate. Morbidity was higher during pandemic (52.5% vs. 35.2%). Mortality rates in patients undergoing emergency surgery was higher in PG (12.1% vs. 4.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The impact of the first wave of COVID-19 in emergency surgery activity has been profound. A significant reduction in emergency surgery was observed, along with longer time periods between patients' onset of symptoms and their arrival at the Emergency Department. Higher morbidity was also observed during the pandemic period.","Bernal Tirapo, Julia; Yuste García, P; Moreno Bargueiras, A; Pastor Altaba, D; Gutiérrez Andreu, M; Gil-Díez López-Maroto, D; Ferrero Herrero, E",Acta Chir Belg,221,16

However, the existing systems are run by the people's smartphones and without a strong participation from the people, the systems become ineffective. Moreover, these systems can be misused to spy on people and breach their privacy. Due to recent privacy breaches, people became anxious about their privacy, and without privacy reassurance, the people may not accept the systems. In this paper, we propose a non-participatory privacy-preserving surveillance system for COVID-19-like pandemics. The system aims to control the spread of COVID-19 infection without depending on the participation of the people and with privacy preservation. In the proposed system, surveillance cameras of public places take images of visitors and compute embedding vectors that encode the facial features of the images by using deep learning techniques. A searchable encryption scheme is used by public places to encrypt the embedding vectors and send them to a cloud server (service manager). Similarly, hospitals and test centers send the encryptions of the embedding vectors of the images of positively-tested people to the cloud server. Finally, the server does operations on encrypted data to learn whether an infected person visited a public place for contact tracing without being able to learn the images or identify the visitors of the places and the infected persons, and then it alerts these places to take precautionary measures. Our analysis indicates that our system is secure and can preserve privacy. Our experimental results demonstrate that our system has high success rate and low false alarm rate, and needs low computation and communication overhead and acceptable search time.","Nabil, M.; Sherif, A.; Mahmoud, M.; Alsmary, W.; Alsabaan, M.",Ieee Access,221,16

We posit that community logic (i.e., community commitment, collective belief, and reciprocity) promotes compliance with public health policies in conservative communities. We analyzed residents’ compliance with social distancing orders in 3053 U.S. counties during the period between a governor issuing stay-at-home orders and April 24th, 2020. Our findings show that the interaction between regional political logic (i.e., political behavioral commitment and ideology) and community logic affects compliance with public health policies. Specifically, conservative ideology and political behavioral commitment lead to non-compliance with social distancing only in communities with weak community logic. Our insights contribute to the literature by highlighting the importance of community logic in promoting compliance with public health policies. Thus, policymakers should consider the joint effect of political logic and community logic when creating and implementing public health edicts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cai, S.; Wang, X.; Zhou, X.; Hyman, M.

We also estimated the risk of hospitalisation by vaccination status. Methods We conducted a cohort study on laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Norway, diagnosed between 3 May and 15 August 2021. We calculated adjusted risk ratios (aRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable binomial regression, accounting for variant, vaccination status, demographic characteristics, week of sampling and underlying comorbidities. Results We included 7,977 cases of Delta and 12,078 cases of Alpha. Overall, 347 (1.7%) cases were hospitalised. The aRR of hospitalisation for Delta compared to Alpha was 0.97 (95%CI 0.76-1.23). Partially vaccinated cases had a 72% reduced risk of hospitalisation (95%CI 59%-82%), and fully vaccinated cases had a 76% reduced risk (95%CI 61%-85%), compared to unvaccinated cases. Conclusions We found no difference in the risk of hospitalisation for Delta cases compared to Alpha cases in Norway. Further research from a wide variety of settings is needed to better understand the association between the Delta variant and severe disease. Our results support the notion that partially and fully vaccinated persons are highly protected against hospitalisation with COVID-19.","Veneti, L.; Valcarcel Salamanca, B.; Seppala, E.; Starrfelt, J.; Storm, M.

Detection of ALL, the most common type of leukemia, has been always riddled with complexity and difficulty in its early stages. Peripheral blood examination as a common method at the beginning of the ALL diagnosis process is a time-consuming, tedious process and greatly depends on the experts' experience, keeping up with the advances in artificial intelligence in the diagnosis process. Keeping up with the growth and development of artificial intelligence algorithms a model was developed to classify B-ALL lymphoblast cells from lymphocytes. Materials and Methods: A Fast, efficient and comprehensive model based on Deep Learning (DL) was proposed by implementing eight well-known Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for feature extraction on all images and evaluating in classifying B-ALL lymphoblast and Normal. After evaluating their performance, four best-performing CNN models were selected to compose an ensemble classifier, by combining the model performance of each classifier. Results: Due to the close similarity of the nuclei of cancerous and normal blood B-ALL cells, the state-of-the-art CNN models alone did not achieve acceptable performance in diagnosing these two classes and their sensitivity was low. The proposed classification model Based on the majority voting technique was adopted to combine the CNN models. The sensitivity of 99.4, the specificity of 96.7, AUC of 98.3, and accuracy of 98.5 were obtained for the proposed model. Conclusion: To classify blood cancerous cells from normal cells, the proposed method can achieve high accuracy without the intervention of the operator in cell feature determination. Thus, the DL-based model can be recommended as an extraordinary tool for the analysis of blood samples in digital laboratory equipment to assist laboratory specialists.","Ghaderzadeh, M.; Hosseini, A.; Asadi, F.; Abolghasemi, H.; Roshanpour, A.",,221,1

Identification and extraction of informative communications out of large volumes of data is critical for accurate situational awareness and timely response. Existing studies use conditions of geolocations, keywords, and topics separately or jointly to retrieve data that can be crisis related, but are not enough to filter subsets of data for different crisis management tasks. We propose that the crisis communication purposes of users can be detected to enhance data selection and prioritization for different crisis management tasks. A classification framework was built to identify three facets of a message: content type, audience type, and information source. The definitions of these categories are not dependent on a specific type of crises. So the classification framework can be potentially applied to different crisis scenarios. Machine learning models were created for the automatic classification of messages. Results showed the CNN-based model achieved the best accuracy (88.5%) for the classification of content type.

In this study, the toxicity of hydroalcoholic and aqueous extracts of seven (7) Cameroonian medicinal plants namely leaves of Cymbopogon citratus (DC.) Stapf, Moringa oleifera Lam and Vernonia amygdalina Delile; barks of Cinchona officinalis and Enantia chloranta Oliv; barks and seeds of Garcinia lucida Vesque and leaves and seeds of Azadirachta indica (Neem) were evaluated using the larval form of the Greater Wax Moth (Galleria mellonella). The median lethal doses (LD50), 90% lethal doses (LD90) and 100% lethal doses were successfully determined using the spline cubic survival curves and equations from the data obtained on the survival rate of G. mellonella 24h after the injection with the extracts. The LD50 values varied from 3.90 g/kg bw to >166.67 g/kg bw and the pattern of toxicity observed was in accordance with previous investigations on the plant materials concerned. The results obtained in this study suggest that G. mellonella can be used as a sensitive, reliable, and robust eco-friendly model to gauge the toxicity of medicinal plants.

Bats may be carriers and reservoirs of multiple pathogens such as viruses, bacteria and parasites, showing in the same time robust immunity against many of them. The microbiota plays a fundamental role on the induction, training and function of the host immune system and the immune system has largely evolved in order to maintain the symbiotic relationship of the host with these diverse microbes. Thus, expanding our knowledge on bat-associated microbiome it can be usefully in understanding bats’ outstanding immune capacities. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of different bacterial communities in heart tissue of insectivorous bats, Nyctalus noctula, Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Rhinoplophus hipposideros, from Central and Eastern Europe using high-throughput sequencing of variable regions of the 16S rRNA. In addition, species-specific PCRs were used to validate the presence of the vector-borne pathogens Bartonella spp. and Rickettsia spp. In this study we identified a wide variety of bacterial groups, with the most abundant phyla being Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. The results showed that at individual level, the year or location had no effect on the diversity and composition of the microbiome, however host species determined both structure and abundance of the bacterial community. We report the presence of vector-borne bacteria Bartonella spp. in samples of N. noctula and indications of Rickettsia spp. in R. hipposideros.

These type V intermediate filament proteins which are predominantly of A and B types provide necessary tensile strength to the nucleus. Single amino acid missense mutations occurring all over the lamin A protein form a cluster of human diseases termed as laminopathies, a few of which principally affect the muscle and cardiac tissues responsible for load bearing functionalities of the body. One such mutation is lamin A350P which causes dilated cardiomyopathy in patients. It is likely that a change from alanine to proline in the α-helical 2B rod domain of the protein might severely disrupt the propensity of the filaments to polymerise into functional higher order structures required to form a fully functional lamina with its characteristic elasticity. In this study, we validate for the very first time, the application of active microrheology employing oscillating optical tweezers to investigate any alterations in the visco-elastic parameters of the mutant protein meshwork in vitro, which might translate into possible changes in nuclear plasticity. We confirm our findings from this robust yet fast method by imaging both the wild type and mutant lamins using a super resolution microscope, and observe changes in the mesh size which explain our measured changes in the viscoelastic parameters of the lamins. This method could naturally be extended to conduct microrheological measurements on any intermediate filament protein or any protein endowed with elastic behavior, with minor schematic modifications, thus bearing significant implications in laminopathies and other diseases which are associated with changes in structural rigidity of any cellular organelle. Significance Lamin A mutations produce an array of diseases termed as laminopathies which are primarily characterized by alteration of elastic behavior of the nucleus which in turn leads to defects in mechanotransduction. This is the first report in the lamin arena which shows a fast, accurate and direct quantification of elastic moduli of lamin A using optical tweezers-based microrheology. This has very significant implications and can be registered to be a robust and universal method that could also be suitably used for probing changes in elastic properties of any proteins or surfactants in a disease scenario such as SARS-Cov2 (Covid-19), which is pandemic at this time.","Mukherjee, C.; Kundu, A.; Dey, R.; Banerjee, A.; Sengupta, K.",bioRxiv,221,25

In this work, the B.1+L249S+E484K lineage was isolated along with A.1, B.1.420 and B.1.111 SARS-CoV-2 lineages without the E484K mutation and the neutralizing titer of convalescent sera was compared using microneutralization assays. While no significant differences in the neutralizing antibody titers were found between A1 and B lineages without the E484K mutation, the neutralizing titers against B.1+L249S+E484K were 1.5, 1.9, 2.1, and 1.3-fold lower than against A.1, B.1.420, B.1.111-I, and B.1.111-II, respectively.

However, depending on the protocol used to estimate that total, there is always a trade-off in the accuracy of the estimate against the risk of leaking confidential data.

Various studies report that rapid urbanization and the changing demands of 21st century life have resulted in higher carbon emissions. This study aims to examine the carbon footprints in an academic building to observe the carbon dioxide (CO2) levels at crucial landmarks and offices. A sensor-based automated system was designed and implemented for the collection of CO2 concentrations at selected locations. In the final stage, a CO2 footprint map was generated to highlight the vulnerable areas of CO2 in the academic building. It was concluded that offices have higher CO2 concentrations at both intervals (morning and afternoon), followed by the laboratory, corridors, and praying area. The CO2 concentration did not exceed 500 ppm at any location. Thus, all locations other than offices had normal CO2 concentration levels. Similarly, the humidity level was also satisfactory. The average humidity level was below 50%, which is below the permissible value of 65%. The recommended range for temperature values as per ASHRAE standards is 22.5 degrees C to 25.5 degrees C, except for prayer places. It was concluded that the selected academic institute is providing a good environment to the users of the building, but that may change once the academic institute becomes fully functional after COVID-19. This study assists the stakeholders in making guidelines and necessary actions to reduce CO2 concentration in academic buildings, as it is expected to rise once the human load increases in the next academic year.

As dental education was significantly influenced by the novel coronavirus pandemic, this study aims to investigate preclinical dental students' perspectives on the implementation of remote education and school closure due to COVID-19 pandemic, self-reported effectiveness of on-line learning as well as their educational and personal experiences. Method. A self-administered questionnaire was posted online to a total of 258 out of 516 second and third-year preclinical dental students in Dec 2020/Jan 2021 at Faculty of Dental Medicine, Medical University-Sofia, Bulgaria. Survey items focused on 3 general domains: student attitude, assessment, and concerns regarding online learning;student current knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 pandemic and student opinion of pandemic psychological impact on public health, personal experiences and intention for vaccination. Findings. One-hundred and sixty-nine students responded to the survey (response rate 65.5%). Most of them (70.4%) approved suspension of face-to-face classes due to the COVID-19 crisis. Eighty percent expressed dissatisfaction toward online teaching sessions and agreed that this will have negative effects on their education. Fifty-eight percent did not find remote education more stressful than in-person training. More concerns were expressed about financial issues than mental health problems. Intention for getting vaccinated was expressed by 53.3% and 40.8% thought that the vaccine would cause many side health effects. Implications for research and practice. Within the limitations of the study, identified gaps in online education could help increase effectiveness of learning environment and create opportunity to enhance education for the future.

MethodologyWe identified all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to five different hospitals in Nepal from June 15 to July 15, 2020. We collected epidemiological, socio-cultural and clinicopathologic data, and stratified the patients based on their symptom status. ResultsThe study included 220 patients with an overall median age of 31.5 (25-37) years, and 181 (82.3%) were males. 159 (72.3%) were asymptomatic, and 163 (74.1%) were imported cases. Of 217 patients with the available data, 110 (50.7%) reported their annual household income less than 2000 US dollars, and 122 (56.2%) practiced Pranayama (yogic rhythmic breathing techniques) regularly. Eight patients (3.6%) required supplemental oxygen and two patients (0.9%) died. None of the patients who practiced Pranayama regularly required supplemental oxygen. Compared to asymptomatic patients, symptomatic patients had greater proportion of females (31.1% vs. 12.6%, p=0.001), imported cases (85.2% vs. 69.8%, p=0.02), illiterates (26.8% vs. 12.1%, p=0.01), alcohol users (43.3% vs. 24.5%, p=0.01), patients feeling stigmatized by society (45.8% vs. 22.6%, p=0.001), and had higher platelet count (253x 109/L vs. 185x109/L, p=0.02). ConclusionsMost cases were imported, asymptomatic young males, with very few deaths.

This article scrutinizes the social science basis of selected popular hypotheses regarding the nexus between the COVID-19 pandemic and the societal transitions towards environmental sustainability. It presents results that were derived through an interdisciplinary dialogue among social scientists. First, it is confirmed that the COVID-19 crisis has likely created a potential window of opportunity for societal change. Yet, to ensure that societal change is enduring and actually supporting the transition towards environmental sustainability, a clear and well-targeted political framework guiding private investments and behavior is required. Second, it is emphasized that there are important structural differences between the COVID-19 crisis and environmental crises, like time scales. Consequently, many strategies used to address the COVID-19 crisis are hardly suitable for long-term transitions towards environmental sustainability. Third, it is argued that transitions towards environmental sustainability—building both on reducing environmental degradation and building socio-techno-ecological resilience—may create co-benefits in terms of preventing and coping with potential future pandemics. However, research still needs to explore how big these synergies are (and whether trade-offs are also possible), and what type of governance framework they require to materialize.","Lehmann, Paul Beck Silke de Brito Mariana Madruga Gawel Erik Groß Matthias Haase Annegret Lepenies Robert Otto Danny Schiller Johannes Strunz Sebastian Thrän Daniela",Sustainability,221,20

The results suggest that the strategies in the different countries were similar, but in Brazil there was a great distinction between public and private institutions. Most of the teachers moved their classes for remote activities, being that they perceive that the difficulties of connection and access to digital technologies is an intervening factor for the continuity of classes and the attention to students. It is also concluded that students are more collaborative and tend to maintain or increase relationships with other students to overcome the barriers and difficulties imposed by social isolation.","Kohls-Santos, P.",Revista Iberoamericana De Educacion,221,1

To better benefit from open government health data in the fight against this pandemic, this study developed a framework for assessing open government health data at the dataset level, providing a tool to evaluate current open government health data's quality and usability COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the review of the existing quality evaluation methods of open government data, the evaluation metrics and their weights were determined by 15 experts in health through the Delphi method and analytic hierarchy process. The authors tested the framework's applicability using open government health data related to COVID-19 in the US, EU and China. Findings: The results of the test capture the quality difference of the current open government health data. At present, the open government health data in the US, EU and China lacks the necessary metadata. Besides, the number, richness of content and timeliness of open datasets need to be improved. Originality/value: Unlike the existing open government data quality measurement, this study proposes a more targeted open government data quality evaluation framework that measures open government health data quality on a range of data quality dimensions with a fine-grained measurement approach. This provides a tool for accurate assessment of public health data for correct decision-making and assessment during a pandemic. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Wu, D.; Xu, H.; Yongyi, W.; Zhu, H.",Library Hi Tech,221,25

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, numerous studies investigating its sectoral influence have been carried out, putting emphasis on demand and supply shocks and changes in trade volumes. However, there has not been much research into the implications of the pandemic for prices. To fill the research gap, this paper is an attempt to examine the impact of COVID-19 on producer prices in the EU-27 in Q2 and Q3 of 2020. The study is based on monthly data on trade in agri-food commodities according to the SITC classification in 2015-2020 and the monthly producer prices index of food (2015 = 100) in the EU coun-tries. It was assumed that the agri-food trade balance is the key factor determining the level and changes of domestic prices. The theoretical background for empirical research is provided by a spatial partial equilibrium model and the concept of spatial market integration. The results of the study reveal that there is a negative and statistically significant relationship between an export-import ratio (which illustrates the country’s self-sufficiency level) in the pre-COVID-19 period and price changes in Q2 of 2020 as well as Q3 of 2020. However, no statistically significant results were obtained for the regression models explaining the relationship between changes in the export/import ratio and price changes in second and third quarters of 2020. © 2021, NAIK Research Institute of Agricultural Economics.

Here we show that ischemia and excess NMDA receptor activation – conditions that trigger neuronal swelling -- cause actin filaments to undergo a rapid and extensive reorganization within the somatodendritic compartment. Normally, F-actin is concentrated within dendritic spines, with relatively little F-actin in the dendrite shaft. However, beginning <5 min after incubation of neurons with NMDA, F-actin depolymerizes within dendritic spines and polymerizes into long, stable filament bundles within the dendrite shaft and soma. A similar “actinification” of the somatodendritic compartment occurs after oxygen/glucose deprivation in vitro, and in mouse brain after photothrombotic stroke in vivo. Following transient, sub-lethal NMDA exposure these actin changes spontaneously reverse within 1-2 hours. A combination of Na+, Cl-, water, and Ca2+ entry are all necessary, but not individually sufficient, for induction of actinification. Spine F-actin depolymerization is also required. Actinification is driven by activation of the F-actin polymerization factor inverted formin-2 (INF2). Silencing of INF2 renders neurons more vulnerable to NMDA-induced membrane leakage and cell death, and formin inhibition markedly increases ischemic infarct severity in vivo. These results show that ischemia-induced actin filament reorganization within the dendritic compartment is an intrinsic pro-survival response that protects neurons from death induced by swelling.","Calabrese, Barbara; Jones, Steven; Yamaguchi-Shiraishi, Yoko; Lingelbach, Michael; Manor, Uri; Svitkina, Tatyana M; Higgs, Henry N; Shih, Andy Y; Halpain, Shelley",bioRxiv,221,16

Due to restrictions put in place to reduce the spread of the disease, it has affected the travel and tourism industry. Using the concepts of ecotourism and sustainable tourism, a systematic qualitative document analysis of available literature was carried out to determine the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on nature-based tourism and its implications on community development, using Botswana as a case study. Results indicate that due to the unsustainable and predominant dependence on the international market, the tourism sector in Botswana has come to a standstill. Furthermore, the promotion of domestic tourism to nature-based attractions may lead to conservation issues. COVID-19 has also had an impact on community development through abrupt losses of employment and income. However, several positive environmental impacts have also been experienced. This article calls for a transformation of the tourism sector to make it more resilient. As a response measure, it is necessary to assess whether there is a need to call for a change in policy from high-value low-volume to low-cost high-volume, which may have negative impacts on conservation.

The emergence and spread of the virus have significantly altered the societal norm to becoming what is called the new normal. The Nigerian linguistic landscape is not spared from the impact caused by the virus. Some new words peculiar to Covid-19 have been introduced into the day to day use of Nigerian English (NE) in some sectors of the society, such as education, social media, health, religion, and markets. There have also been lexical innovations as well as variations in the use of these vocabularies. Using the variationist model, this research investigates these COVID-19 vocabularies and how factors such as region, class, and situational contexts bring about linguistic variations in daily use. In doing this, it identifies and compiles the lexemes as being used and also describes their contextual usages in Nigerian English. This study adopts a descriptive survey design and collects data using questionnaires from two hundred Nigerian English speakers in SouthwestNigeria. The research shows that NE speakers use diverse morphological processes to create new lexemes based on the COVID-19 context. It also produces a COVID-19 vocabulary corpus that reveals Nigerian speakers’ linguistic and innovative ability of the English language and the effect of social experiences on language use. It will also help provide the correct contextual meanings of the new words related to COVID-19. © 2021 The Author(s).

This process is reversed by deubiquitinases (DUBs) that deconjugate the ubiquitin (Ub) moiety or poly-Ub chains from substrates. In the past decade, tremendous efforts have been focused on targeting DUBs for drug discovery. However, most chemical compounds with inhibitory activity for DUBs suffer from mild potency and low selectivity. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a phage display-based protein engineering strategy for generating Ub variant (UbV) inhibitors and have previously successfully applied it to the Ub-specific protease (USP) family of cysteine proteases. In this work, we leveraged the UbV platform to target STAMBP, a member of the JAB1/MPN/MOV34 (JAMM) metalloprotease family of DUB enzymes. We identified two UbVs (UbVSP.1 and UbVSP.3) that bind to STAMBP with high affinity but differ in their selectivity for the closely related paralog STAMBPL1. We determined the STAMBPL1-UbVSP.1 complex structure by X-ray crystallography, revealing hotspots of the tight JAMM-UbV interaction. Finally, we show that UbVSP.1 and UbVSP.3 are potent inhibitors of the STAMBP isopeptidase activity, far exceeding the reported small-molecule inhibitor BC-1471. This work demonstrates that UbV technology is suitable to develop tool molecules for metalloproteases. These tools can be used to understand the cellular function of JAMM family DUBs.","Guo, Yusong; Liu, Qi; Mallette, Evan; Caba, Cody; Hou, Feng; Fux, Julia; LaPlante, Gabriel; Dong, Aiping; Zhang, Qi; Zheng, Hui; Tong, Yufeng; Zhang, Wei",bioRxiv,221,16

The neurodevelopmental defects associated with ZikV infections early in pregnancy are well documented, however the potential defects associated with infections in late pregnancy and perinatal period are less well characterized. Further, the long-term sequelae of these infections are not fully understood. Immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice infected at one day old (P1), which neurodevelopmentally model late pregnancy in humans, develop a transient neurological syndrome including unsteady gait, kinetic tremors, severe ataxia and seizures 10-15 days post-infection (dpi) but symptoms subside after a week, and most animals survive. Despite apparent recovery, MRI of convalescent mice shows reduced cerebellar volume that correlates with altered coordination and motor function as well as hyperactivity and impulsivity. Persistent mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes including Cd80, Il-1α, and Ifn-γ together with Cd3, Cd8 and perforin (PrfA), suggested the persistence of a low-grade inflammatory process. Further, the brain parenchyma of convalescent mice harbor multiple small foci with viral antigen, active apoptotic processes in neurons, and cellular infiltrates, surrounded by activated astrocytes and microglia as late as 1-year post-infection. Detection of negative-sense strand viral RNA and replication of virus derived from these convalescent mice by blinded passage in Vero cells confirmed that low levels of live ZikV persist in CNS of convalescent mice life-long. Our studies establish that Zika can establish reservoirs in CNS and suggest that anti-viral treatment that clears virus from the CNS as well as long-term neurological and behavioral monitoring may be needed for patients known to be exposed to ZikV at an early age. Author’s summary The congenital brain malformations associated with ZikV infections early in pregnancy are well documented, however whether apparently asymptomatic perinatal exposure could lead to long term sequelae is not fully understood. Using a non-lethal neonatal mouse model, we examine host-pathogen interactions, anatomical changes and behavioral patterns by following survivors of the acute infection for over 1 year. We discover that infectious Zika virus has the potential to remain in the CNS for life, lodged within small foci surrounded by gliosis and infiltrating immune cells that may act to limit the viral spread, but also interfere with healing and contribute to life-long neuropathic and behavioral sequelae. These results suggest that anti-viral treatment and long-term neurological and behavioral monitoring may be indicated for patients known to have been exposed to Zika virus, regardless of neurodevelopmental disease severity.","Ireland, Derek D.C.; Manangeeswaran, Mohanraj; Lewkowicz, Aaron; Engel, Kaliroi; Clark, Sarah M.; Laniyan, Adelle; Sykes, Jacob; Lee, Ha Na; McWilliams, Ian; Kelly-Baker, Logan; Tonelli, Leonardo H.; Verthelyi, Daniela",bioRxiv,221,23

This approach provides intravoxel distributions of correlations of water mobilities in orthogonal directions, revealing sub-voxel diffusion components. Here we use it to investigate water diffusivities along axial and radial orientations within spinal cord specimens with confirmed, tract-specific axonal injury. First, we show using transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry that tract-specific axonal beading occurs following Wallerian degeneration in the cortico-spinal tract as direct sequelae to closed head injury. We demonstrate that although some voxel-averaged diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics are sensitive to this axonal injury, they are non-specific, i.e., they do not reveal an underlying biophysical mechanism of injury. Then we employ 2D diffusion correlation imaging (DCI) to improve discrimination of different water microenvironments by measuring and mapping the joint water mobility distributions perpendicular and parallel to the spinal cord axis. We determine six distinct diffusion spectral components that differ according to their microscopic anisotropy and mobility. We show that at the injury site a highly anisotropic diffusion component completely disappears and instead becomes more isotropic. Based on these findings, an injury-specific MR image of the spinal cord was generated, and a radiological-pathological correlation with histological silver staining % area was performed. The resulting strong and significant correlation (r = 0.70, p < 0.0001) indicates the high specificity with which DCI detects injury-induced tissue alterations. We predict that the ability to selectively image microstructural changes following axonal injury in the spinal cord can be useful in clinical and research applications by enabling specific detection and increased sensitivity to injury-induced microstructural alterations. These results also encourage us to translate DCI to higher spatial dimensions to enable assessment of traumatic axonal injury, and possibly other diseases and disorders in the brain.","Benjamini, Dan; Hutchinson, Elizabeth B.; Komlosh, Michal E.; Comrie, Courtney J.; Schwerin, Susan C.; Zhang, Guofeng; Pierpaoli, Carlo; Basser, Peter J.",bioRxiv,221,26

Many countries are currently generating alternatives to promote tourism and allow tourists to return and improve the current situation. In Peru, borders were closed, and therefore the different tourist sites and activities were closed, generating unemployment in the actors involved in the tourism sector, as well as the local communities that underpinned their economy in the activities of this area. Faced with this problem, it is evident that technology and the digitization of tourism activities will allow supporting this sector, so this article proposes a digital transformation model for the reactivation of tourism, taking the Lambayeque region as a case study. We have carried out a systematic investigation of tourism information and applied interviews to specialists in the sector and surveys of the actors involved. The model is based on five dimensions: technology, management, processes, tourism product, and digital tourist. For each dimension, we describe its purpose and the proposals applying solutions and technological tools that allow digital transformation. Our model was validated through an expert judgment, the result of which was acceptable, hoping that its implementation will contribute to the reactivation of tourism. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Alarcón, R.; Aquino, J.; Bravo, J.; Germán, N.; Valdivia, C.","6th Brazilian Technology Symposium, BTSym 2020",221,24

Yet they are often denied their right to organise, they cannot exercise their right to be represented in decisions that directly affect their lives and futures. The entries in this chapter gathered from the leaders of street vendors associations and media representatives throughout the world, reflect their struggles to organise, to maintain a livelihood and to survive in pandemic conditions. Arbind Singh and César García Arnal give a profile of the street vendors in India and Spain respectively and explore how social and solidarity economy, a concept that, however, is still not clear to some experts in the field offers a solution to the problems rising after Corona pandemic.

The ubiquitous availability of sequence data, allows us to predicting epitopes from sequence in order to focus time-consuming wet-lab experiments onto the most promising epitope regions. Here, we extend our previously developed sequence-based predictors for homodimer and heterodimer PPI interfaces to predict epitope residues that have the potential to bind an antibody. Results We collected and curated a high quality epitope dataset from the SAbDaB database. Our generic PPI heterodimer predictor obtained an AUC-ROC of 0.666 when evaluated on the epitope test set. We then trained a random forest model specifically on the epitope dataset, reaching AUC 0.694. Further training on the combined heterodimer and epitope datasets, improves our final predictor to AUC 0.703 on the epitope test set. This is better than the best state-of-the-art sequence-based epitope predictor BepiPred-2.0. On one solved antibody-antigen structure of the COVID19 virus spike RNA binding domain, our predictor reaches AUC 0.778. We added the SeRenDIP-CE Conformational Epitope predictors to our webserver, which is simple to use and only requires a single antigen sequence as input, which will help make the method immediately applicable in a wide range of biomedical and biomolecular research.

In this study, we examine improvements in the synchronization characteristics of the brain’s oscillations induced by 40Hz auditory stimulation based on electroencephalography data recorded from a group of dementia patients. We observed that when the quality of entrainment surpasses a certain level, several indicators of brain synchronization significantly improve. Specifically, the entrained oscillatory activity maintains temporal phase stability in the frontal, parietal, and occipital regions, and persistent spatial phase coupling between them. In addition, notable theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling is observed in these areas. Interestingly, a high theta power at rest predicts the quality of entrainment. We identify differentiating attributes of temporal/spatial synchronization and cross-frequency coupling in the data of two groups with entrained and non-entrained responses which point to enhanced network synchronization caused by entrainment and can explain its potential therapeutic effects.","Lahijanian, Mojtaba; Aghajan, Hamid; Vahabi, Zahra; Afzal, Arshia",bioRxiv,221,1

This work aims to bring this technology to people with T1D to enable unique patient/data interactions. Methods: A 5-week pilot study was carried out in 15 adults with T1D using Control-IQ technology (age 36±13 years, HbA1c 6.5±0.7%) to evaluate acceptance of the proposed Web-Based Simulation Tool (WST). The study consisted of 1 week of observation (Phase 1) and 4 weeks of interaction with WST (Phase 2). Data were automatically collected via Tandem Diabetes Care t:connect web application, and used to generate personalized models of the participants' glucose metabolism. Results: Success rate in generating models was 86.4%, achieving an average MARD of 7.4±3.2%. Interaction time was 15.8±10.7 min per week. Comparing Phases 1 and 2, no variation was detected in time in range 70-180 mg/dl (80.1 [70.4,89.6]% vs. 80 [69.7,87.9]%). Time in 70-250 mg/dl increased slightly (94.2 [90.3,95.7]% vs. 96.2 [92.1,97.9]%), especially overnight (92.8 [88.3,98.2]% vs. 97.2 [91.8,99.6]%), and for participants who modified their pump settings based on WST simulations (90 [88.7,92.4]% vs. 94.5 [87.1,99.6]%). One subject tested COVID positive during the study and was excluded from this analysis due to abnormal hyperglycemia. Analysis of Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS)-17 pre and post-system use shows a reduction in diabetes-related distress (2.2 [1.7,3.4] vs. 2 [1.7,2.4]). Trust, ease of use, and usefulness scores were 80 [60,80]%, 60 [60,80]%, and 80 [60,80]%, respectively.

This study assessed the antibacterial, antioxidant potential and phytochemical screening of medicinal plant Angelica glauca (Choru) root and stem extracts against respiratory tract pathogens i.e., Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 1144, Streptococcus pneumoniae MTCC 655, Streptococcus pyogenes MTCC 442, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 2474 and Klebsiella pneumoniae MTCC 4030. The plant material was collected from Tungnath 3,800m amsl of Garhwal Himalaya. Root and stem of the plants were washed, shade dried, grinded into fine powder and extracted in the organic solvents of different polarity (petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol and water). Antibacterial activities of prepared extracts were assayed using agar well diffusion and two-fold serial dilution method of MIC determination. Antioxidant potential was determined using DPPH assay and phytochemical analysis was performed using qualitative methods for different phytochemicals. Experimental outcomes revealed maximum antibacterial and antioxidant activity of methanol extract;also the maximum groups of phytochemicals were present in the methanolic extract. The methanol extract produced ZOIs of 11.0±0.54mm to 30.3±1.58mm diameters and MICs ranges were recorded between 3.12 mg/ml to 25 mg/ml against all the tested bacteria. Alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, tannins, steroids and saponins were present in the extracts of A. glauca. This study favors a good response towards using A. glauca as natural antioxidant in herbal medicines, either in pure form or as supplement with other herbal formulations already available in the market, to enhance their potential against respiratory tract diseases. In the present COVID-19 pandemic situation, use of A. glauca can be beneficial, as it’s methanolic extract showed promising antibacterial activity against bacterial pathogens of human respiratory tract. © 2021, Association of Pharmaceutical Teachers of India.

Testing has two broad uses, namely to track epidemic dynamics and to reduce transmission by identifying and managing cases. In this work we develop a modelling framework to examine the effects of test allocation in an epidemic, with a focus on using testing to minimise transmission. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as an example, we examine how the number of tests conducted per day relates to reduction in disease transmission, in the context of logistical constraints on the testing system. We show that if daily testing is above the routine capacity of a testing system, which can cause delays, then those delays can undermine efforts to reduce transmission through contact tracing and quarantine. This work highlights that the two goals of aiming to reduce transmission and aiming to identify all cases are different, and it is possible that focusing on one may undermine achieving the other. To develop an effective strategy, the goals must be clear and performance metrics must match the goals of the testing strategy. If metrics do not match the objectives of the strategy, then those metrics may incentivise actions that undermine achieving the objectives.","Baker, C.

Here we show that a single intramuscular injection of Adeno-Associated Virus-6 (AAV6) or AAV9 encoding a modified, N-terminal domain deleted (ΔNTD) spike protein induces robust cellular immunity and provides long-term protection in k18-hACE2 transgenic mice from lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge, associated weight loss and pneumonia independent of vaccine-induced neutralizing humoral immunity. In both mice and macaques, vaccine-induced cellular immunity results in the clearance of transduced muscle fibers coincident with macrophage and CD8+ cytotoxic T cell infiltration at the site of immunization. Additionally, mice demonstrate a strong Type-1 polarized cellular immunophenotype and equivalent ex vivo T cell reactivity to peptides of wt and alpha (B.1.1.7) variant spike. These studies demonstrate not only that AAV6 and AAV9 can function as effective vaccine platforms, but also that vaccines can provide long-term efficacy primarily through the induction of cellular immunity.

This article proposes my use of a performance score - ‘Skill-less Tricks’ - as a method of cultivating an ongoing connection with those friends and collaborators. As many western nation states have spent much of the last year policing their borders in ways anathema to the freedom of movement expected by global tourism, my time and relationships in Palestine have been brought into sharp relief. This article begins with a discussion of my connection to Palestine and how I came to be regularly working with communities in the West Bank. It explains the personal and political impulse for crossing the wall between Israel and Palestine, and the bodily experience of ‘what it takes to cross a border’ (Noeth 2019). The main reason for my ongoing work in Palestine is due to working with the SkatePal charity in the West Bank who build skateparks and teach children to skateboard. This article reflects on the role SkatePal take within this specific political context. The history and current context of the Palestine/Israel conflict have been well documented in numerous sources including Elizabeth Matthews’s edited collection with David Newman and Mohammed Dajani Daoudi (2011). This source presents a range of viewpoints on central aspects of the conflict from sixteen contributors and offers a balanced introduction. Instead of repeating work that has been done elsewhere, this article reflects on aspects of the current state of the conflict from my own personal perspective captured in journal entries, which are scattered throughout the main body of the text. This selection of journal entries is - more or less - as they were written during the three weeks I spent with SkatePal in the summer of 2015. I have selected material from my journal that is most directly associated with experiences of the wall, of crossing checkpoints and borders and about expressive movement practice. The decision I made to journal my experience was inspired by reflective practice in performance and dance broadly as a research method, and by anthropologist Michael Taussig’s own reflections and experience of Palestine in his article, ‘Two weeks in Palestine’ (2013).

Disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic further increase rates of child poverty due to widespread job and income loss and economic insecurity among families. Poverty leads to unequal distribution of power and resources, which impacts the economic, material, environmental and psychosocial conditions in which children live. There is evidence that poverty is associated with adverse child health and developmental outcomes in the short term, as well as increased risk of chronic diseases and mental illnesses over the life course. Over the past decade, advances in genomic and epigenomic research have helped elucidate molecular mechanisms that could in part be responsible for these long-term effects. Here, we review evidence suggestive of biological embedding of early life poverty in three, interacting physiological systems that are potential contributors to the increased risk of disease: the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, the brain, and the immune system. We also review interventions that have been developed to both eliminate childhood poverty and alleviate its impact on pediatric development and health. Pertinently, studies estimate that the costs of child poverty, calculated by increased healthcare expenditures and loss of productivity, are immense. We argue that investing in child development by reducing child poverty has the potential to improve the health and well-being at the population level, which would go a long way towards benefiting the economy and promoting a more just society by helping all individuals reach their full potential.","Schmidt, Kim L.; Merrill, Sarah M.; Gill, Randip Miller Gregory E.; Gadermann, Anne M.; Kobor, Michael S.",Developmental Review,221,1

The study also aims to investigate the relationship between CSR practices and financial performance. The information consistency between the quality certificates reported on corporate websites and official database statements is also explored. Lastly, the paper investigates how the relationship between the size of wineries and CSR disclosure changes according to firms' geographic location. Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyses CSR corporate communication via the websites of a sample of Italian wineries by adjusting the theoretical framework developed by Amran (2012) to the wine sector's peculiarities. Moreover, a cross-certification analysis and a moderation analysis were performed to fulfil the purpose of the research. Findings: The analysis revealed the extensive use of CSR disclosure via websites. It was found that company size positively affects CSR disclosure and Quality Certification Disclosure (QCD), while geographic location slightly moderates the relationship between the two variables. In addition, a negative relationship between CSR disclosure and corporate financial performance and its reverse causality emerged. Moreover, for most wineries, information consistency between the quality certificates reported on corporate websites and official database statements was observed. Research limitations/implications: The study's main limitation is that the search process was performed during lockdown. Therefore, the examined issues could change in the near future due to the shift in priorities that the COVID-19 pandemic is determining. Practical implications: The results can help managers implement CSR disclosure and QCD practices to enhance stakeholder legitimacy and enable their companies to compete in strongly competitive international markets.

We aimed at assessing first-time experience of telemedicine (TM) in the cardiology outpatient clinic of a tertiary medical center during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: TM was used in the cardiology outpatient clinic from April 7th to May 29th, 2020. All the patients that had applied to TM were included in the study. TM was performed by phone calls. The data written by the cardiologist telecommunicating with the patients were recorded by accessing each patient's electronic file. Assessment of TM in terms of efficacy and patient satisfaction was made in August 2020 by recalling all the patients by phone. Results: A total of 140 patients had TM visit on the appointment day. The population was older (69±13.75) with a male predominance (53.5%). Main complaints were chest pain and high blood pressure. Twenty patients had their medical drugs rearranged. Forty-two patients were invited for face-to-face cardiac evaluation. One of them was hospitalized due to heart failure. Almost all (93.6%) were very satisfied and preferred TM instead of face-to-face outpatient clinic service in terms of easy complaint expression and easy understanding of medication rearrangement (53.6%). They stated that TM was efficient in the prevention of unnecessary hospital visits and it should continue after the pandemic as well. Conclusion: TM is a potential alternative for continuing healthcare delivery to most of the cardiac patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hospitals as health service facilities continuously strive to provide optimal service to patients with the confirmed COVID-19 infection. Resident doctors usually handle COVID-19 patients at the Zainoel Abidin Hospital (ZAH). As the front liner in handling the COVID-19 pandemic, these resident doctors must have adequate knowledge and good attitudes in dealing with COVID-19 patients, especially regarding ethical and medicolegal. Aim: This study aims at finding out the level of knowledge and attitudes of resident doctors in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic at the ZAH, Aceh. Methods: This was a cross sectional study conducted among resident doctors (n=80) in the ZAH during November-December 2020 with a self-administered online questionnaire. It had been tested for validity by experts with a Content Validity Ratio / CVR of 0.738 and reliability of 0.732. The data were analyzed using the frequency distribution test (univariate) and the Chi square correlation test (bivariate). Results and Discussion: The results show that the majority of respondents had inadequate knowledge of ethical and medicolegal issues in handling the COVID-19 pandemic (70.0%);however, they had a positive attitude in overcoming ethical and medicolegal issues, i.e.77.5%. The chi square statistical test result shows no correlation between knowledge and attitude with a p-value of 0.077 (p-value >0.05). Conclusions: Therefore, it can be concluded that the theoretical knowledge of doctors was not sufficient to identify ethical and medicolegal issues, but the attitude in dealing with ethical and medicolegal issues was satisfactory. This result offers a new opportunity and challenge to increase the awareness of doctors in applying their knowledge and attitudes towards handling the COVID-19 pandemic.","Suryadi, T.; Suardi, H.

Recently, break-through infections following vaccination against this virus have been reported. Here, we describe the humoral immune response of break-through infections in fully vaccinated individuals of old age from an outbreak in a nursery home. Methods: In cooperation with the local health authority, blood samples from fully vaccinated and infected as well as fully vaccinated and uninfected residents of the nursery home were collected four weeks after the onset of the outbreak. The humoral immune response was determined in a neutralisation assay with replication-competent virus isolates and by a quantitative ELISA. Results: In this outbreak a total of 23 residents and four health care workers were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Four residents were unvaccinated, including one with a severe course of disease who later deceased. Despite their old age, all vaccinated residents showed no or only mild disease. Comparison of the humoral immune response revealed significantly higher antibody levels in fully vaccinated infected individuals compared to fully vaccinated uninfected individuals (p<0.001). Notably, although only a minority of the vaccinated uninfected group showed neutralisation capacity against SARS-CoV-2, all vaccinated and infected individuals showed high-titer neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 including the alpha and beta variant. Discussion: Large SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks can occur in fully vaccinated populations, but seem to associate with mild disease. SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated individuals is a strong booster of the humoral immune response providing enhanced neutralisation capacity against immune evasion variants.","MuÌller, L.; Andree, M.; Ostermann, P.

Both have a great impact on a sustainable economy. Taking China as an example, we use a computable general equilibrium model with multi-sectors and multi-households and consider six different scenarios to simulate and evaluate the aggregate impacts of the pandemic and crude oil prices. We divide the impact of the pandemic into the changes of factor input and the changes of consumer preference and find that the decline of factor input is the leading cause of the economic downturn. The sharp drop in crude oil prices has a significant negative impact on the low-carbon economy. Although the pandemic has led to a decline in global carbon emissions, it is only because of the economic downturn. The epidemic situation and the change of oil price have double impacts on the economy, especially the sustainable economy. Adjusting the price gap between fossil energy and renewable energy (e.g., more stringent carbon pricing) and appropriate tax cuts on residents may be effective ways to alleviate the impact, which should be one of the environmental policies in the post-COVID-19 era.","Jia, Zhijie Wen Shiyan Lin Boqiang",Applied Energy,221,10

During this year many confounding factors contributed to the disruption of the normal FSC and impacted the system adversely. This includes the agricultural food production system, the first phase of the FSC, to the final delivery of food to consumers. Food was lost or wasted as farmers were unable to transfer and distribute the food to retailers. Food shortages became problematic and consumers were not able to obtain necessary staples. Then consumers started to purchase too much (hoarding), as they feared shortages, which resulted in both rises in food prices and in higher food waste by consumers. Several reports indicated that food waste during this period was remarkably more than in pre-pandemic times. These situations were worsened as the pandemic continued. In this paper we define food loss as occurring mostly during the agricultural food production and food waste that mostly happening during distribution of food at the retailer and consumer levels. The food loss and waste (FLW) both have been shown to add to the diminution of the natural resources and the rise in greenhouse gas emissions. The high level of greenhouse gas in turn can harm the environment. In the United States (U.S.), similar to other countries, natural resources such as land (about 50%) and water (67%) are used for agriculture and food production. The main objective of this paper is therefore, to emphasize some of the current findings on the potential impact of the pandemic on the FSC which resulted in more FLW. Many reports suggest every stage of the FSC can be a significant contributor of FLW and environmental resource depletion. Long-term strategies must be implemented to keep the FSC robust, stable and sustainable during unfavorable circumstances and crises.","Wunderlich, Shahla M.",International Journal of Environmental Impacts,221,15

The fate of these in vivo generated T cells was subsequently assessed by in vitro proliferation assays with lymphocytes from different lymphoid organs of diseased animals over a long period of time. Virus-specific T cell responses continuously decreased during the establishment of persistent infection and could no longer be detected after 5-6 months post infectionem, when inflammatory reactions in the brain had ceased. By contrast, autoantigen-specific T cells kept their ability to mount characteristic secondary responses--although at an overall rather low level--over long periods of time; these autoreactive T cells homed to a specific lymphoid organ, the perithymic lymph node.

No single domain of DPAP B is required for delivery to the vacuolar membrane, because removal or replacement of either the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, or lumenal domain did not affect the protein's transport to the vacuole. DPAP A was localized by indirect immunofluorescence to non-vacuolar, punctate structures characteristic of the yeast Golgi apparatus. The 118-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A is sufficient for retention of the protein in these structures, since replacement of the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP B with that of DPAP A resulted in an immunolocalization pattern indistinguishable from that of wild type DPAP A. Overproduction of DPAP A resulted in its mislocalization to the vacuole, because cells expressing high levels of DPAP A exhibited vacuolar as well as Golgi staining. Deletion of 22 residues of the DPAP A cytoplasmic domain resulted in mislocalization of the mutant protein to the vacuole. Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A is both necessary and sufficient for Golgi retention, and removal of the retention signal, or saturation of the retention apparatus by overproducing DPAP A, resulted in transport to the vacuole. Like wild type DPAP B, the delivery of mutant membrane proteins to the vacuole was unaffected in the secretory vesicle-blocked sec1 mutant; thus, transport to the vacuole was not via the plasma membrane followed by endocytosis. These data are consistent with a model in which membrane proteins are delivered to the vacuole along a default pathway.",,J Cell Biol,221,1

Thus, enhanced capabilities are needed that enable the full and robust forensic exploitation and interpretation of microbial evidence from acts of bioterrorism or biocrimes. To respond to the need, greater resources and efforts are being applied to the burgeoning field of microbial forensics. Microbial forensics focuses on the characterization, analysis and interpretation of evidence for attributional purposes from a bioterrorism act, biocrime, hoax or inadvertent agent release. To enhance attribution capabilities, a major component of microbial forensics is the analysis of nucleic acids to associate or eliminate putative samples. The degree that attribution can be addressed depends on the context of the case, the available knowledge of the genetics, phylogeny, and ecology of the target microorganism, and technologies applied. The types of genetic markers and features that can impact statistical inferences of microbial forensic evidence include: single nucleotide polymorphisms, repetitive sequences, insertions and deletions, mobile elements, pathogenicity islands, virulence and resistance genes, house keeping genes, structural genes, whole genome sequences, asexual and sexual reproduction, horizontal gene transfer, conjugation, transduction, lysogeny, gene conversion, recombination, gene duplication, rearrangements, and mutational hotspots.

To protect public health and avert potential disruption to the economy, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has committed substantial effort in preparedness for avian and pandemic influenza. Public health infrastructures for emerging infectious diseases have been developed to enhance command, control and coordination of emergency response. Strategies against avian and pandemic influenza are formulated to reduce opportunities for human infection, detect pandemic influenza timely, and enhance emergency preparedness and response capacity. Key components of the pandemic response include strengthening disease surveillance systems, updating legislation on infectious disease prevention and control, enhancing traveller health measures, building surge capacity, maintaining adequate pharmaceutical stockpiles, and ensuring business continuity during crisis. Challenges from avian and pandemic influenza are not to be underestimated. Implementing quarantine and social distancing measures to contain or mitigate the spread of pandemic influenza is problematic in a highly urbanised city like Hong Kong as they involved complex operational and ethical issues. Sustaining effective risk communication campaigns during interpandemic times is another challenge.

Recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of BaMV binds to the pseudoknot poly(A) tail in gel mobility shift assays (C.-Y. Huang, Y.-L. Huang, M. Meng, Y.-H. Hsu, and C.-H. Tsai, J. Virol. 75:2818-2824, 2001). Approximately 20 nucleotides of the poly(A) tail adjacent to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) are protected from diethylpyrocarbonate modification, suggesting that this region may be used to initiate minus-strand RNA synthesis. The 5' terminus of the minus-strand RNA synthesized by the RdRp in vitro was examined using 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and DNA sequencing. Minus-strand RNA synthesis was found to initiate from several positions within the poly(A) tail, with the highest frequency of initiation being from the 7th to the 10th adenylates counted from the 5'-most adenylate of the poly(A) tail. Sequence analyses of BaMV progeny RNAs recovered from Nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts which were inoculated with mutants containing a mutation at the 1st, 4th, 7th, or 16th position of the poly(A) tail suggested the existence of variable initiation sites, similar to those found in 5' RACE experiments. We deduce that the initiation site for minus-strand RNA synthesis is not fixed at one position but resides opposite one of the 15 adenylates of the poly(A) tail immediately downstream of the 3' UTR of BaMV genomic RNA.","Cheng, Jai-Hong; Peng, Chi-Weng; Hsu, Yau-Heiu; Tsai, Ching-Hsiu",Journal of virology,221,16

High levels of T cells specific to capsids of vectors based on AAV2 and a phylogenetically related AAV variant were detected. Vectors from other AAV clades such as AAV8 (ref. 3), however, did not lead to activation of capsid-specific T cells. Through the generation of AAV2-AAV8 hybrids and the creation of site-directed mutations, we mapped the domain that directs the activation of T cells to the RXXR motif on VP3, which was previously shown to confer binding of the virion to heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). Evaluation of natural and engineered AAV variants showed direct correlations between heparin binding, uptake into human dendritic cells (DCs) and activation of capsid-specific T cells. The role of heparin binding in the activation of CD8(+) T cells may be useful in modulating the immunogenicity of antigens and improving the safety profile of existing AAV vectors for gene therapy.","Vandenberghe, Luk H; Wang, Lili; Somanathan, Suryanarayan; Zhi, Yan; Figueredo, Joanita; Calcedo, Roberto; Sanmiguel, Julio; Desai, Ravi A; Chen, Christopher S; Johnston, Julie; Grant, Rebecca L; Gao, Guangping; Wilson, James M",Nature medicine,221,1

Coronaviruses, like the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated virus (SARS-CoV), bud from the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment. In this study, the subcellular distribution and maturation of SARS-CoV surface proteins S, M and E were analysed by using C-terminally tagged proteins. As early as 30 min post-entry into the endoplasmic reticulum, high-mannosylated S assembles into trimers prior to acquisition of complex N-glycans in the Golgi. Like S, M acquires high-mannose N-glycans that are subsequently modified into complex N-glycans in the Golgi. The N-glycosylation profile and the absence of O-glycosylation on M protein relate SARS-CoV to the previously described group 1 and 3 coronaviruses. Immunofluorescence analysis shows that S is detected in several compartments along the secretory pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane while M predominantly localizes in the Golgi, where it accumulates, and in trafficking vesicles. The E protein is not glycosylated. Pulse-chase labelling and confocal microscopy in the presence of protein translation inhibitor cycloheximide revealed that the E protein has a short half-life of 30 min. E protein is found in bright perinuclear patches colocalizing with endoplasmic reticulum markers. In conclusion, SARS-CoV surface proteins S, M and E show differential subcellular localizations when expressed alone suggesting that additional cellular or viral factors might be required for coordinated trafficking to the virus assembly site in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment.","Nal, Béatrice; Chan, Cheman; Kien, Francois; Siu, Lewis; Tse, Jane; Chu, Kid; Kam, Jason; Staropoli, Isabelle; Crescenzo-Chaigne, Bernadette; Escriou, Nicolas; van der Werf, Sylvie; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Altmeyer, Ralf",The Journal of general virology,221,16

The T1 fingerprinting showed that the Dutch isolates formed two clusters. The first cluster contained strains H52, H120, D387, V1259, V1385 and V1397; the estimated sequence homology is 99%. Cluster two comprised strains D207, D274, D212, D1466, D3128 and D3896, which have about 95% sequence homology. The M41 virus did not belong to either cluster. The four different serotypes which arose in the late 1970s belonged to cluster two and appeared to be different from the vaccine strains (H52 and H120) used at that time. This indicates that the strains were newly introduced and could have arisen from a common virus. On the other hand, three recently isolated field strains were genetically closely related to the vaccine strains H120 and H52 (cluster one), suggesting that these live vaccine strains themselves could have given rise to these serologically altered field isolates. The data are relevant to the development of new vaccine strategies.","Kusters, J G; Niesters, H G; Bleumink-Pluym, N M; Davelaar, F G; Horzinek, M C; Van der Zeijst, B A",The Journal of general virology,221,1

RNase protection analysis showed the antileader to be approximately the same length as the leader. The kinetics of antileader appearance was the same as that for the appearance of minus-strand RNA species. This, along with a demonstration that viral mRNAs become packaged, gives further support to the idea that coronavirus mRNAs can undergo replication via subgenomic mRNA-length replicative intermediates, and that input mRNAs from infecting virions may serve as initial templates for their own replication.

A model described recently by Sawicki et al. (S. G. Sawicki, D. L. Sawicki, D. Younker, Y. Meyer, V. Thiel, H. Stokes, and S. G. Siddell, PLoS Pathog. 1:e39, 2005), based upon complementation studies of known temperature-sensitive (TS) mutants of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59, proposes that an intermediate comprised of nsp4 to nsp10/11 ( approximately 150 kDa) is involved in negative-strand synthesis. Furthermore, the mature forms of nsp4 to nsp10 are thought to serve as cofactors with other replicase proteins to assemble a larger replication complex specifically formed to transcribe positive-strand RNAs. In this study, we introduced a single-amino-acid change (nsp10:Q65E) associated with the TS-LA6 phenotype into nsp10 of the infectious clone of MHV. Growth kinetic studies demonstrated that this mutation was sufficient to generate the TS phenotype at permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. Our results demonstrate that the TS mutant variant of nsp10 inhibits the main protease, 3CLpro, blocking its function completely at the nonpermissive temperature. These results implicate nsp10 as being a critical factor in the activation of 3CLpro function. We discuss how these findings challenge the current hypothesis that nsp4 to nsp10/11 functions as a single cistron in negative-strand RNA synthesis and analyze recent complementation data in light of these new findings.","Donaldson, Eric F; Graham, Rachel L; Sims, Amy C; Denison, Mark R; Baric, Ralph S",Journal of virology,221,16

BACKGROUND: Tracheostomy is often performed for prolonged endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients. However, in the context of COVID-19, tracheostomy placement pathways have been altered due to the poor prognosis of intubated patients as well as the risk of transmission to providers through this highly aerosolizing procedure. METHODS: A prospective single-system multi-center observational cohort study was performed on patients who underwent tracheostomy following acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 53 patients who underwent tracheostomy, the average time from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy was 19.7 daysâ±â6.9 days. The most common indication for tracheostomy was ARDS, followed by failure to wean ventilation and post-ECMO decannulation. 30 patients (56.6%) were liberated from the ventilator, 16 (30.2%) have been discharged alive, 7 (13.2%) have been decannulated, and 6 (11.3%) died.

Community engagement is the first line of defense in the fight against infectious diseases, and general practitioners (GPs) play an important role in it. GPs are facing unique challenges from disasters and pandemics in delivering health care. However, there is still no suitable mobile management system that can help GPs collect data, dynamically assess risks, and effectively triage or follow-up with patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to design, develop, and deploy a mobile-based decision support system for COVID-19 (DDC19) to assist GPs in collecting data, assessing risk, triaging, managing, and following up with patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Based on the actual scenarios and the process of patients using health care, we analyzed the key issues that need to be solved and designed the main business flowchart of DDC19. We then constructed a COVID-19 dynamic risk stratification model with high recall and clinical interpretability, which was based on a multiclass logistic regression algorithm. Finally, through a 10-fold cross-validation to quantitatively evaluate the risk stratification ability of the model, a total of 2243 clinical data consisting of 36 dimension clinical features from fever clinics were used for training and evaluation of the model. RESULTS: DDC19 is composed of three parts: mobile terminal apps for the patient-end and GP-end, and the database system. All mobile terminal devices were wirelessly connected to the back end data center to implement request sending and data transmission. We used low risk, moderate risk, and high risk as labels, and adopted a 10-fold cross-validation method to evaluate and test the COVID-19 dynamic risk stratification model in different scenarios (different dimensions of personal clinical data accessible at an earlier stage). The data set dimensions were (2243, 15) when only using the data of patients' demographic information, clinical symptoms, and contact history; (2243, 35) when the results of blood tests were added; and (2243, 36) after obtaining the computed tomography imaging results of the patient. The average value of the three classification results of the macro-area under the curve were all above 0.71 in each scenario. CONCLUSIONS: DCC19 is a mobile decision support system designed and developed to assist GPs in providing dynamic risk assessments for patients with suspected COVID-19 during the outbreak, and the model had a good ability to predict risk levels in any scenario it covered.","Liu, Ying; Wang, Zhixiao; Ren, Jingjing; Tian, Yu; Zhou, Min; Zhou, Tianshu; Ye, Kangli; Zhao, Yinghao; Qiu, Yunqing; Li, Jingsong",J Med Internet Res,221,16

However, the field needs to better understand if a change in care delivery from in-person to telehealth as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic will yield durable patient engagement and health outcomes for patients with obesity. The objective of this study was to examine the association of mode of healthcare utilization (telehealth versus in-person) and sociodemographic factors among patients with obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective medical chart review identified patients with obesity from a university outpatient obesity medicine clinic and a community bariatric surgery practice. Patients completed an online survey (1 June 2020-24 September 2020) to assess changes in healthcare utilization modality during subsequent changes in infection rates in the geographic area. Logistic regression analysis examined the association of mode of healthcare utilization and key sociodemographic characteristics.

Adjusted logistic regression models showed older age was inversely associated with telehealth use (adjusted odds ratio = 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.34-0.98) and non-Hispanic black were more likely to use telehealth compared to non-Hispanic white (adjusted odds ratio = 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.05-2.81). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting access to healthcare among patients with obesity. Telehealth is an emerging modality that can maintain healthcare access during the pandemic, but utilization varies by age and ethnicity in this high-risk population.","Almandoz, Jaime P; Xie, Luyu; Schellinger, Jeffrey N; Mathew, M Sunil; Edwards, Khary; Ofori, Ashley; Kukreja, Sachin; Schneider, Benjamin; Messiah, Sarah E",J Telemed Telecare,221,13

However, clinical features, which can differentiate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19, are not clear. We therefore examined the key clinical features of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. This study included 60 COVID-19 patients and 100 non-COVID-19 patients, diagnosed by PCR, and no significant differences in the age and sex were seen between the two groups. The frequencies of fatigue, loose stool, diarrhea, nasal obstruction, olfactory dysfunction, taste dysfunction, underlying hyperlipidemia, and the prescription of angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients than those in non-COVID-19 patients. The counts of leucocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, monocytes, and basophils and the levels of chloride and calcium in blood of COVID-19 patients were significantly lower than those of non-COVID-19 patients. The frequencies of atypical lymphocytes and the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and potassium were significantly higher in COVID-19 than those in non-COVID-19. The C-reactive protein (CRP) level in COVID-19 patients was significantly lower than that in non-COVID-19 patients, when we compared CRP levels among patients with elevated CRP. This study is the first to indicate that electrolyte levels and the frequency of atypical lymphocytes in COVID-19 are significantly different from those in non-COVID-19. Fatigue, loose stool, diarrhea, nasal obstruction, olfactory dysfunction, and taste dysfunction were the key symptoms of COVID-19. Furthermore, hyperlipidemia and ARB may be risk factors of COVID-19.

While the majority of cases in most territories around the world have fitted an older age profile, our analysis shows that positive cases in Hong Kong have been concentrated among younger age groups, with the largest incidence of cases reported in the 15-24 age group. This is despite the population's rapidly aging structure and extremely high levels of population density. Using detailed case data from Hong Kong's Centre for Health Department and Immigration Department, we analyze the sex and age distribution of the confirmed cases along with their recent travel histories and immigration flows for the period January to April 2020. Our analysis highlights Hong Kong's high proportion of imported cases and large overseas student population in developing COVID-19 hotspot areas such as the United Kingdom. Combined with community action and targeted and aggressive early policy measures taken to contain the virus, these factors may have contributed to the uniquely younger age structure of COVID-19 cases in the city. Consequently, this young profile of confirmed cases may have prevented fatalities in the territory. Recent research has highlighted the importance of a demographic approach to understanding COVID-19 transmission and fatality rates. The experience in Hong Kong shows that while an older population age structure may be important for understanding COVID-19 fatality, it is not a given. From a social science perspective at least, there is 'no easy answer' to why one area should experience COVID-19 differently from another.","Cruz, Christian Joy Pattawi; Ganly, Rachel; Li, Zilin; Gietel-Basten, Stuart",PLoS One,221,5

Data were collected by an online survey and the Perceived Stress Scale-14. Descriptive statistics, independent t-test, one- way analysis of variance, regression analysis and Bonferroni test were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Percentage of nurses with moderate level of occupational stress was 62%. High working hours and nurse:patient ratios, heavy workload and failure in patient treatment were the main factors of occupational stress. Level of occupational stress was affected by gender, number of children, years of experience in intensive care and the type of work shift. CONCLUSION: Intensive care nurses in Turkey experienced moderate stress during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therapists and patients were asked to rate the meaning of different areas of life before as well as during the COVID-19 crisis.

The rating of the importance of the domains of living was differently affected by the COVID-19 situation (p < 0.001). While the meaning of physical and mental health during COVID-19 was rated higher than before, the opposite was observed for work (p < 0.001). No differences were found for relationships and friends, as well as for hobbies. As no interactions between perspective (therapists vs. patients), area of life, and time point (before vs. during COVID-19) were observed, it can be concluded that the COVID-19 situation changed the subjective attribution of meaning concerning different aspects of life similarly in therapists as well as patients.

As a result of the pandemic, a computer-based case simulation OSCE (CCS-OSCE) has been designed. The objective of this article is to describe the creation, administration, and development of the test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This work is a descriptive study of the CCS-OSCE from its planning stages in April 2020 to its administration in June 2020. RESULTS: The CCS-OSCE evaluated the competences of anamnesis, exploration, clinical judgment, ethical aspects, interprofessional relations, prevention, and health promotion. No technical or communication skills were evaluated. The CCS-OSCE consisted of ten test sections, each of which had a 12-minutes time limit and ranged from six to 21 questions (mean: 1.1 minutes/question). The CCS-OSCE used the virtual campus platform of each of the 16 participating medical schools, which had a total of 2,829 students in their sixth year of study. It was jointly held on two dates in June 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The CCS-OSCE made it possible to bring together the various medical schools and carry out interdisciplinary work.

STUDY DESIGN: We present a patient with monochorionic-diamniotic twins that develops coronavirus disease 2019 infection at 15 weeks of gestation. The pregnancy is further complicated by stage II twin-twin transfusion syndrome. She undergoes laser ablation, which is complicated by development of a subchorionic hematoma.

Optimal operation conditions are normally determined experimentally, repeating the extractions at different conditions and determining the efficiencies by an analytical technique. To shorten and simplify the optimization protocol, millifluidic platforms have been electrically characterized by impedance spectroscopy. The magnitude of the resistance of the electromembrane has been found very predictive of the migration capacity and extraction efficiency of three different parabens on real time. The optimal conditions (4 V of applied potential) (Electromembrane extraction low voltage) have been successfully applied in the extraction of parabens from urine samples, that not only improves the extraction efficiency (100% for all compounds) but also provides a very low current intensity (7 µA), which is very important in electromembrane to minimize electrolysis phenomena. The possibility to optimize one of the most critical and important parameters such as the voltage with a simple electrical model may accelerate the production of application-specific millifluidic electromembrane platforms in a short development time.

However, reduced trapezial height has sometimes been reported after LRTI. Longer immobilization and delayed rehabilitation times are also problematic. In this study, we evaluated the clinical and radiological outcomes of patients who underwent our modified LRTI procedure. METHODS: Retrospective study included 26 thumbs in 24 cases with advanced stages. Our modified Burton's procedure was as follows: (1) trapeziectomy was limited to distal-half, (2) the entire flexor carpi radialis (FCR) was harvested from the forearm, and (3) half-slip of the FCR tendon was stabilized by interference screw in the first metacarpal bone tunnel. RESULTS: Pain on the visual analogue scale (VAS), the quick Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand score, tip pinch strength significantly improved postoperatively. The preoperative height of the trapezial space was well-maintained at final follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging at the one-year follow-up showed the existence of FCR tendon ball in 15 cases. Eighteen housewives resumed their daily activities after a mean period of 10 days postoperative, while another 6 patients returned to their original jobs after 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Our modified LRTI method involves distal-half trapeziectomy and entire FCR interposition. A sewn FCR tendon ball always provide enough volume to fill the trapeziectomy space, which helps to prevent sinking of the metacarpal bone. Our technique produced sufficient ligamentoplasty and allowed early mobilization after surgery.","Muramatsu, Keiichi; Tani, Yasuhiro; Seto, Tetsuya; Arcinue, Jasson; Rayel, Felma; Hashimoto, Takahiro; Iwanaga, Ryuta; Sakai, Takashi",Eur. j. orthop. surg. traumatol,221,16

Inadequate screening capacity has hampered COVID-19 detection, while traditional infectious disease response has been delayed due to significant demands for healthcare resources, time and personnel. This study investigated whether an online health decision-support tool could supplement COVID-19 surveillance and detection in China and the USA. SETTING: Daily website traffic to Thermia was collected from China and the USA, and cross-correlation analyses were used to assess the designated lag time between the daily time series of Thermia sessions and COVID-19 case counts from 22 January to 23 April 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Thermia is a validated health decision-support tool that was modified to include content aimed at educating users about Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations on COVID-19 symptoms. An advertising campaign was released on Microsoft Advertising to refer searches for COVID-19 symptoms to Thermia. RESULTS: The lead times observed for Thermia sessions to COVID-19 case reports was 3 days in China and 19 days in the USA. We found negative cross-correlation between the number of Thermia sessions and rates of influenza A and B, possibly due to the decreasing prevalence of influenza and the lack of specificity of the system for identification of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that early deployment of an online campaign and modified health decision-support tool may support identification of emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19. Researchers and public health officials should deploy web campaigns as early as possible in an epidemic to detect, identify and engage those potentially at risk to help prevent transmission of the disease.","Hswen, Yulin; Brownstein, John S; Xu, Xiang; Yom-Tov, Elad",BMJ Open,221,24

The recent demonstration that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Covid-19 (AstraZeneca) vaccine (ChA) favors the production of anti-platelet factor 4 (anti-PF4) antibodies, blood clots, and thrombocytopenia raises the question of whether other anti-CoViD-19 vaccines favor the same patterns of events. We assessed the frequency of severe adverse events (SAEs) documented in the EudraVigilance European database up to April 16, 2021 related to thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and blood clots in recipients of ChA compared to that of recipients of the BNT162b2 Covid-19 (Pfizer/BioNTech) vaccine (BNT). ChA administration was associated with a much higher frequency of SAEs in each AE Reaction Group as compared with that elicited by BNT. When considering AEs caused by thrombocytopenia, bleeding and blood clots, we observed 33 and 151 SAEs/1 million doses in BNT and ChA recipients, respectively. When considering patients with AEs related to cerebral/splanchnic venous thrombosis, and/or thrombocytopenia, we documented 4 and 30 SAEs and 0.4 and 4.8 deaths/1 million doses for BNT and ChA recipients, respectively. The highest risk following ChA vaccination is in young people and, likely, women of reproductive age, as suggested by hypothesized scenarios. In conclusion, the immune reaction promoted by ChA vaccine may lead to not only thrombocytopenia and cerebral/splanchnic venous thrombosis but also other thrombotic and thromboembolic SAEs. These events are not favored by BNT vaccine. Our study may help in the evaluation of the benefit/risk profile of the ChA vaccine considering the epidemic curve present in a country.","Cari, Luigi; Fiore, Paolo; Naghavi Alhosseini, Mahdieh; Sava, Gianni; Nocentini, Giuseppe",J Autoimmun,221,16

One of the consequences of this lockdown is delays in medical and surgical procedures for common diseases. The aim of this study was to model the impact on survival of tumor growth caused by such delays in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and melanoma. Material and methods: Multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study. We constructed an exponential growth model for both SCC and melanoma to estimate tumor growth between patient-reported onset and surgical excision at different time points. Results: Data from 200 patients with SCC of the head and neck and 1000 patients with cutaneous melanoma were included. An exponential growth curve was calculated for each tumor type and we estimated tumor size after 1, 2, and 3 months of potential surgical delay. The proportion of patients with T3 SCC (diameter > 4â¯cm or thickness > 6â¯mm) increased from 41.5% (83 patients) in the initial study group to an estimated 58.5%, 70.5%, and 72% after 1, 2, and 3 months of delay. Disease-specific survival at 2, 5, and 10 years in patients whose surgery was delayed by 3 months decreased by 6.2%, 8.2%, and 5.2%, respectively. The proportion of patients with ultrathick melanoma (> 6â¯mm) increased from 6.9% in the initial study group to 21.9%, 30.2%, and 30.2% at 1, 2, and 3 months. Five- and 10-year disease-specific survival both decreased by 14.4% in patients treated after a potential delay of 3 months. Conclusions: In the absence of adequate diagnosis and treatment of SCC and melanoma in the current lockdown situation in Spain, we can expect to see to a considerable increase in large and thick SCCs and melanomas. Efforts must be taken to encourage self-examination and facilitate access to dermatologists in order to prevent further delays.","Tejera-Vaquerizo, A; Cañueto, J; Toll, A; Santos-Juanes, J; Jaka, A; Ferrandiz, C; Sanmartín, O; Ribero, S; Moreno-Ramírez, D; Almazán, F; Fuente, M J; Podlipnik, S; Nagore, E",Actas Dermosifiliogr,221,1

Results indicate that delayed vaccination of 1- to 4-year-olds enabled the initial spread and that increased infectious contact, likely via ""measles parties,"" facilitated later transmission. We found that around half of infants were susceptible by age 1 and thus had many infections. Without the implemented vaccination campaigns, numbers of infections and hospitalizations could have been >10 times higher and would predominantly affect those under 4. These results suggest that a first vaccine dose before age 1 and the second dose before age 4 could allow parents to vaccinate and protect children more effectively should a high level of vaccine hesitancy persist.

Her responses are informed by recent cross-disciplinary and neuropsychological research on the digital age. She considers what happens to free association, evenly suspended attention and reverie when working by phone or online; the loss of the consulting room as a containing physical space for both clinician and patient; the relationship between place and time; and whether (and how) we can maintain a focus on transference and countertransference in the presence of the threat of death.

Deltoid skin microvascular complement screening has been applied to patients with various systemic complement-mediated microvascular syndromes, best exemplified by atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. In 21 of 23 cases, substantial microvascular deposition of complement components was identified. The two patients without significant complement deposition included one patient with moderate disease and a severely ill patient who although on a ventilator for a day was discharged after 3 days. The dominant microvascular complement immunoreactant identified was the terminal membranolytic attack complex C5b-9. Microvascular complement deposition strongly colocalized in situ with the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins including spike glycoproteins in the endothelial cells as well as the viral receptor ACE2 in lesional and nonlesional skin; viral RNA was not evident. Microvascular SARS-CoV-2 viral protein, complement, and ACE2 expression was most conspicuous in the subcutaneous fat. Although the samples from severely ill patients with COVID-19 were from grossly normal skin, light microscopically focal microvascular abnormalities were evident that included endothelial cell denudement, basement membrane zone reduplication, and small thrombi. It is concluded that complement activation is common in grossly normal skin, especially in the subcutaneous fat which may provide a link between severe disease and obesity, in people with severe COVID-19, and the strong colocalization with the ACE2 receptor and viral capsid proteins without viral RNA suggests that circulating viral proteins (ie, pseudovirions) may dock onto the endothelial of these microvessels and induce complement activation.","Magro, Cynthia M; Mulvey, J Justin; Laurence, Jeffrey; Seshan, Surya; Crowson, A Neil; Dannenberg, Andrew J; Salvatore, Steven; Harp, Joanna; Nuovo, Gerard J",Hum Pathol,221,21

DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study using Photovoice was carried out between March and June 2020. METHODS: A total of 20 health professionals were recruited from public and private healthcare services. The participants were invited to share photographs about their experiences while working during COVID-19 pandemic. Following the Photovoice method, audio-recorded interviews were conducted. The data were analysed using the 'SHOWED' mnemonic, with five questions answered about each photograph. The EQUATOR checklist has been used. RESULTS/FINDINGS: Three themes emerged: (1) Personal attitudes of health professionals; (2) Support from the community; and (3) Management of institutional resources. Despite the fact that health professionals in this study were exposed to major risks while caring for patients with COVID-19' they felt a strong sense of responsibility towards the community. In order to handle these stressful situations, they used coping mechanisms, good humour and leisure, but also received support from the population, who saw them as highly skilled health professionals. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the essential role of health professionals in the COVID-19 pandemic and the tireless work they are carrying out to provided highly skilled care. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: These findings could contribute to raise awareness on the needs of health professionals during the pandemic, allowing managers to plan strategies to ensure the safety, and well-being of these professionals, as well as adopting similar strategies in their practice to create a space for critical reflection through participatory approaches.","Badanta, Bárbara; Acevedo-Aguilera, Rosa; Lucchetti, Giancarlo; de Diego-Cordero, Rocío",J. clin. nurs,221,16

Our study aimed to assess whether the COVID-19 pandemic further deepened these already existing health inequalities. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Data were collected from five longitudinal age-homogenous British cohorts (born in 2000-2002, 1989-1990, 1970, 1958 and 1946). PARTICIPANTS: A web survey was sent to the cohorts. Anybody who responded to the survey was included, resulting in 14 891 eligible participants. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURED: The survey provided data on cancelled surgical or medical appointments, and the number of care hours received in a week during the first UK COVID-19 national lockdown. INTERVENTIONS: Using binary or ordered logistic regression, we evaluated whether these outcomes differed by sex, ethnicity, SEP and having a chronic illness. Adjustment was made for study design, non-response weights, psychological distress, presence of children or adolescents in the household, COVID-19 infection, key worker status, and whether participants had received a shielding letter. Meta-analyses were performed across the cohorts, and meta-regression was used to evaluate the effect of age as a moderator. RESULTS: Women (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.55) and those with a chronic illness (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.05) experienced significantly more cancellations during lockdown (all p<0.0001). Ethnic minorities and those with a chronic illness required a higher number of care hours during the lockdown (both OR&#8776;2.00, all p<0.002). SEP was not associated with cancellation or care hours. Age was not independently associated with either outcome in the meta-regression. CONCLUSION: The UK government's lockdown approach during the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have deepened existing health inequalities, impacting predominantly women, ethnic minorities and those with chronic illnesses. Public health authorities need to implement urgent policies to ensure equitable access to health and care for all in preparation for a fourthwave.","Topriceanu, Constantin-Cristian; Wong, Andrew; Moon, James C; Hughes, Alun D; Bann, David; Chaturvedi, Nishi; Patalay, Praveetha; Conti, Gabriella; Captur, Gaby",BMJ Open,221,24

During May 2020, the authors examined intended vaccination in the next 12 months in relationship to demographic variables, healthcare attitudes, and personal COVID-19 experiences for two samples of adults--those who did not receive influenza vaccine during the prior 12 months, and those who did. METHODS: In May 2020, a cross-sectional online survey was conducted with a national US sample. Participants reported prior influenza vaccination (yes/no during prior 12 months) and anticipated vaccination (yes/no during next 12 months). Covariates included demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, race-ethnicity, political ideology), general beliefs (e.g., benefits of vaccines, altruistic attitudes), and COVID-19 health beliefs and experiences (COVID-19 worry and severity, perception of COVID-19 as a community threat, knowing someone with COVID-19). For each group, hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was conducted with intent to vaccinate as the outcome. RESULTS: Among participants (n = 3502), 47% did not receive influenza vaccine in the prior 12 months and 53% had; 25.5% of non-vaccinators and 91.9% of vaccinators intended future vaccination. For non-vaccinators, odds of intending vaccination was associated with race/ethnicity (Hispanics were more likely to intend than white-NH; AOR = 1.74; 95% CI = 1.23-2.4), greater perceived benefits of vaccination (AOR = 2.19; 95% CI = 1.88-2.54), and perception of COVID-19 as a community threat (AOR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.49-2.45). For vaccinators, odds of intending vaccination was associated with age (AOR = 1.04; 95% CI = 1.03-1.05), race/ethnicity (Black-NH and Other-NH were less likely to intend than white-NH, AOR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.36-0.999; and AOR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.24-0.84, respectively), greater perceived benefits of vaccination (AOR = 1.88; 95% CI = 1.45-2.45) and greater perception of collective benefits of vaccines (AOR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.15-1.90). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic may have served as a cue to action for influenza vaccination intention among some prior non-vaccinators whereas intention among prior vaccinators is more related to positive attitudes toward vaccination.","Sturm, Lynne; Kasting, Monica L; Head, Katharine J; Hartsock, Jane A; Zimet, Gregory D",Vaccine,221,5

The study included 34 patients (23 males; mean age 60.2 ± 16.6 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia. Besides standard medical examination, the AHA blood levels were observed, including antinuclear antibodies, antiendothelial cell antibodies, anti-cardiomyocyte antibodies (AbC), anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA), and cardiac conducting tissue antibodies. Median hospital length of stay was 14 [13; 18] days. AHA levels were increased in 25 (73.5%) patients. Significant correlation (p < 0.05) of AHA levels with cardiovascular manifestations (r = 0.459) was found. AbC levels correlated with pneumonia severity (r = 0.472), respiratory failure (r = 0.387), need for invasive ventilation (r = 0.469), chest pain (r = 0.374), low QRS voltage (r = 0.415), and levels of C-reactive protein (r = 0.360) and lactate dehydrogenase (r = 0.360). ASMA levels were found to correlate with atrial fibrillation (r = 0.414, p < 0.05). Antinuclear antibodies and AbC levels correlated with pericardial effusion (r = 0.721 and r = 0.745, respectively, p < 0.05). The lethality rate was 8.8%. AbC and ASMA levels correlated significantly with lethality (r = 0.363 and r = 0.426, respectively, p < 0.05) and were prognostically important.

The involvement of cardiovascular system in COVID­19 has been proven and increased healthcare system resources are redirected towards handling infected patients, which induces major changes in access to services and prioritization in the management of patients with chronic cardiovascular disease unrelated to COVID­19. In this expert opinion, conceived by the task force involving the Working Groups on Valvular Heart Diseases and Cardiac Surgery as well as the Association of Cardiovascular Intervention of the Polish Cardiac Society, modification of diagnostic pathways, principles of healthcare personnel protection, and treatment guidelines regarding triage and prioritization are suggested. Heart Teams responsible for the treatment of valvular heart disease should continue their work using telemedicine and digital technology. Diagnostic tests must be simplified or deferred to minimize the number of potentially dangerous aerosol­generating procedures, such as transesophageal echocardiography or exercise imaging. The treatment of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation has to be offered particularly due to urgent indications and in patients with advanced disease and poor prognosis. Expert risk stratification is essential for triage and setting the priority lists. In each case, an appropriate level of personal protection must be ensured for the healthcare personnel to prevent spreading infection and preserve specialized manpower, who will supply the continuing need for handling serious chronic cardiovascular disease. Importantly, as soon as the local epidemic situation improves, efforts must be made to restore standard opportunities for elective treatment of valvular heart disease and occluder­based therapies according to existing guidelines, thus rebuilding the state ­of ­the ­art cardiovascular services.","Plonska-Gosciniak, Edyta; Suwalski, Piotr; Bartus, Stanislaw; Kukulski, Tomasz; Komar, Monika; Wojakowski, Wojciech; Grygier, Marek; Pruszczyk, Piotr; Gasior, Zbigniew; Huczek, Zenon; Berger-Kucza, Adrianna; Bak, Janusz; Sorysz, Danuta; Kasprzak, Jaroslaw D",Kardiol Pol,221,28

These structural units, termed repetitive structural motifs (RSMs), potentially mediate capsid assembly by specific RNA–protein interactions. However, general knowledge of the conservation and/or the diversity of RSMs in the positive-sense ssRNA coronaviruses (CoVs) is limited. By performing structural phylogenetic analysis, we identified a variety of RSMs in nearly all CoV genomic RNAs, which are exclusively located in the 5′-untranslated regions (UTRs) and/or in the inter-domain regions of poly-protein 1ab coding sequences in a lineage-specific manner. In all alpha- and beta-CoVs, except for Embecovirus spp, two to four copies of 5′-gUUYCGUc-3′ RSMs displaying conserved hexa-loop sequences were generally identified in Stem-loop 5 (SL5) located in the 5′-UTRs of genomic RNAs. In Embecovirus spp., however, two to eight copies of 5′-agc-3′/guAAu RSMs were found in the coding regions of non-structural protein (NSP) 3 and/or NSP15 in open reading frame (ORF) 1ab. In gamma- and delta-CoVs, other types of RSMs were found in several clustered structural elements in 5′-UTRs and/or ORF1ab. The identification of RSM-encompassing structural elements in all CoVs suggests that these RNA elements play fundamental roles in the life cycle of CoVs. In the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2, beta-CoV-specific RSMs are also found in its SL5, displaying two copies of 5′-gUUUCGUc-3′ motifs. However, multiple sequence alignment reveals that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 possesses a variant RSM harboring SL5b C241U, and intriguingly, several variations in the coding sequences of viral proteins, such as Nsp12 P323L, S protein D614G, and N protein R203K-G204R, are concurrently found with such variant RSM. In conclusion, the comprehensive exploration for RSMs reveals phylogenetic insights into the RNA structural elements in CoVs as a whole and provides a new perspective on variations currently found in SARS-CoV-2.","Chen, Shih-Cheng Olsthoorn René C.

It is assumed that the air resistance is a nonlinear function of the droplet's velocity and that the rate of decrease of the droplet's external surface area depends only on the relative humidity and the ambient temperature. The droplet's initial content is considered to be 98 wt% water, 1 wt% salt and 1 wt% protein. The change of the average density of the droplet due to water evaporation is determined, up to the instant when the droplet reduces to its nucleus, consisting of salt and dry protein only. The numerical solution of the governing differential equations of droplet's motion gives the trajectories of different-sized droplets ejected at different velocities and angles, and under different relative humidities and rates of evaporation. The evaporation times are compared with the times for droplets to reach the ground after being ejected from a given height. The maximum horizontal and vertical distances reached by the droplet are evaluated in the presence of wind and discussed in the context of possible infection spreading.","Lubarda, Marko V.; Lubarda, Vlado A.",,221,24

The current project explored what caused U.S. adults' fear of COVID-19 and how they regulated fear using a longitudinal two-wave survey on a national-representative sample (N = 315). Results showed that participants' media exposure frequency and their perceived valence of interpersonal communication predicted their fear of COVID-19 at both waves, and fear at wave 1 further motivated higher frequency of media and interpersonal communication as well as strengthened perceptions that their interpersonal conversations emphasized the danger aspect of COVID-19 at wave 2. Counterarguing was effective in down-regulating individuals' fear, which in turn further encouraged more subsequent use of such strategy. Avoidance used in wave 1 predicted counterarguing at wave 2, while counterarguing employed in wave 1 predicted the subsequent use of reappraisal. Individuals may choose to use counterarguing as a maladaptive coping strategy to control their fear, and they tend to shift from one emotion regulation strategy to another as the pandemic progresses.","Li, Ruobing",Health Commun,221,10

METHODS: We have modeled the mortality and the intensive care unit (ICU) requirement for the care of patients with cancer infected with COVID-19 in Latin America. A dynamic multistate Markov model was constructed. Transition probabilities were estimated on the basis of published reports for cumulative probability of complications. Basic reproductive number (R0) values were modeled with R using the EpiEstim package. Estimations of days of ICU requirement and absolute mortality were calculated by imputing number of cumulative cases in the Markov model. RESULTS: Estimated median time of ICU requirement was 12.7 days, median time to mortality was 16.3 days after infection, and median time to severe event was 8.1 days. Peak ICU occupancy for patients with cancer was calculated at 16 days after infection. Deterministic sensitivity analysis revealed an interval for mortality between 18.5% and 30.4%. With the actual incidence tendency, Latin America would be expected to lose approximately 111,725 patients with cancer to SARS-CoV-2 (range, 87,116-143,154 patients) by the 60th day since the start of the outbreak. Losses calculated vary between < 1% to 17.6% of all patients with cancer in the region. CONCLUSION: Cancer-related cases and deaths attributable to SARS-CoV-2 will put a great strain on health care systems in Latin America. Early implementation of interventions on the basis of data given by disease modeling could mitigate both infections and deaths among patients with cancer.","Ruiz-Patiño, Alejandro; Arrieta, Oscar; Pino, Luis E; Rolfo, Christian; Ricaurte, Luisa; Recondo, Gonzalo; Zatarain-Barron, Zyanya-Lucia; Corrales, Luis; Martín, Claudio; Barrón, Feliciano; Vargas, Carlos; Carranza, Hernán; Otero, Jorge; Rodriguez, July; Sotelo, Carolina; Viola, Lucia; Russo, Alessandro; Rosell, Rafael; Cardona, Andrés F",JCO Glob Oncol,221,9

The anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) was selected as a model drug and embedded in the inner gelatin core to obtain high encapsulation efficiency. The advantage of the outer magnetic layer is that it targets the drug to the tumor tissue and provides controlled drug release. The physicochemical properties of doxorubicin-gelatin/Fe3O4-alginate nanoparticles (DG/FA NPs) were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction. The mean diameter of DG/FA NPs, which was determined using a zeta potential analyzer, was 401.8 ± 3.6 nm. The encapsulation rate was 64.6 ± 11.8%. In vitro drug release and accumulation were also studied. It was found that the release of DOX accelerated in an acidic condition. With the manipulation of an external magnetic field, DG/FA NPs efficiently targeted Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) breast cancer cells and showed in the nucleus after 6 h of incubation. After 12 h of incubation, the relative fluorescence intensity reached 98.4%, and the cell viability of MCF-7 cells decreased to 52.3 ± 4.64%. Dual-layer DG/FA NPs could efficiently encapsulate and deliver DOX into MCF-7 cells to cause the death of cancer cells. The results show that DG/FA NPs have the potential for use in targeted drug delivery and cancer therapy.","Huang, Chiung-Hua; Chuang, Ting-Ju; Ke, Cherng-Jyh; Yao, Chun-Hsu",,221,2

Cytokine storm syndromes can be genetic or a secondary complication of autoimmune or autoinflammatory disorders, infections, and haematological malignancies. These syndromes represent a key area of interface between rheumatology and general medicine. Rheumatologists often lead in management, in view of their experience using intensive immunosuppressive regimens and managing cytokine storm syndromes in the context of rheumatic disorders or infection (known as secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or macrophage activation syndrome [sHLH/MAS]). Interleukin (IL)-1 is pivotal in hyperinflammation. Anakinra, a recombinant humanised IL-1 receptor antagonist, is licenced at a dose of 100 mg once daily by subcutaneous injection for rheumatoid arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, adult-onset Still's disease, and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes. In cytokine storm syndromes, the subcutaneous route is often problematic, as absorption can be unreliable in patients with critical illness, and multiple injections are needed to achieve the high doses required. As a result, intravenous anakinra is used in clinical practice for sHLH/MAS, despite this being an off-licence indication and route of administration. Among 46 patients admitted to our three international, tertiary centres for sHLH/MAS and treated with anakinra over 12 months, the intravenous route of delivery was used in 18 (39%) patients. In this Viewpoint, we describe current challenges in the management of cytokine storm syndromes and review the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of intravenous anakinra. There is accumulating evidence to support the rationale for, and safety of, intravenous anakinra as a first-line treatment in patients with sHLH/MAS. Intravenous anakinra has important clinical relevance when high doses of drug are required or if patients have subcutaneous oedema, severe thrombocytopenia, or neurological involvement. Cross-speciality management and collaboration, with the generation of international, multi-centre registries and biobanks, are needed to better understand the aetiopathogenesis and improve the poor prognosis of cytokine storm syndromes.","Mehta, Puja; Cron, Randy Q; Hartwell, James; Manson, Jessica J; Tattersall, Rachel S",,221,16

With a target of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030, EHE initially scales up effective HIV prevention and care in 57 localities that comprise the greatest proportion of annual HIV diagnoses in the United States (US). However, the EHE effort has been eclipsed by another infectious disease 11 months into the Initiative's implementation. SARS-COV-2, a novel coronavirus, has infected more than eight million Americans and at least 223 000 (as of 23 October 2020) have succumbed to the disease. This commentary explores the social conditions that place communities of colour at greater risk for COVID-19 and HIV, and assesses challenges to EHE in a post-COVID-19 universe. DISCUSSION: One of the many common threads between HIV and COVID-19 is the disproportionate impact of each disease among communities of colour. A recent report by the National Academy of Sciences surmised that as much as 70% of health outcomes are due to health access, socio-economic factors and environmental conditions. Social determinants of health associated with greater HIV burden in Black and Brown communities have re-emerged in epidemiological studies of disproportionate COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in communities of colour. Using data from the scientific literature, this commentary makes direct comparisons between HIV and COVID-19 racial disparities across the social determinants of health. Furthermore, I examine three sets of challenges facing EHE: (1) Challenges that hamper both the EHE and COVID-19 response (i.e. insufficiently addressing the social determinants of health; amplification of disparities as new health technologies are introduced) (2) Challenges posed by COVID-19 (i.e. diverting HIV resources to address COVID-19 and tapering of EHE funding generally); and (3) Challenges unrelated to COVID-19 (i.e. emergence of new and related health disparities; repeal of the Affordable Care Act and long-term viability of EHE). CONCLUSIONS: Racism and discrimination place communities of colour at greater risk for COVID-19 as well as HIV. Achieving and sustaining an end to the U.S. HIV epidemic will require structural change to eliminate conditions that give rise to and maintain disparities.","Millett, Gregorio A",J Int AIDS Soc,221,1

We estimated resource use and direct medical costs per symptomatic infection and at the national level, with various ""attack rates"" (infection rates), to understand the potential economic benefits of reducing the burden of the disease. A single symptomatic COVID-19 case could incur a median direct medical cost of $3,045 during the course of the infection alone.

In this study, we attempted to design a siRNA molecule to silence the most suitable nucleocapsid(N) gene of SARS-CoV-2, which play a major role during viral pathogenesis, replication, encapsidation and RNA packaging. At first, 270 complete N gene sequences of different strains in Bangladesh of these viruses were retrieved from the NCBI database. Different computational methods were used to design siRNA molecules. A siRNA molecule was built against these strains using the SiDirect 2.0 server. Using Mfold and the OligoCalc server, the siRNA molecule was tested for its secondary structure and GC material. The Clustal Omega tool was employed to evaluate any off-target harmony of the planned siRNA molecule. Herein, we proposed a duplex siRNA molecule that does not fit any off-target sequences for the gene silencing of SARS-CoV-2. To treat SARS-CoV-2 infections, currently, any effective therapy is not available. Our engineered siRNA molecule could give an alternative therapeutic approach against various sequenced SARS-CoV-2 strains in Bangladesh.","Bappy, Syed Shahariar; Shibly, Abu Zaffar; Sultana, Sorna; Mohiuddin, A K M; Kabir, Yearul",Comput Biol Chem,221,10

Stressful situations are known to alter eating habits and increase the risk for obesity. In our study, we aimed to investigate the effect of the lockdown measures on nutrition behavior among young adults. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 1964 voluntary participants from Bavarian universities. All participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire, semi-quantitatively evaluating the amount and type of food before and during pandemic lockdown. Study subjects were inquired to give information about acquisition and food procurement. The primary outcome was the change in food amount, secondary outcomes included alterations of food composition and procurement. RESULTS: Our study cohort (mean age 23.3 ± 4.0 years, 28.5% male) had a mean body mass index of 22.1 ± 4.5 kg/m2. The overall food amount increased in 31.2% of participants (n = 610) during lockdown and decreased in 16.8% (n = 328). A multinominal regression model revealed that an increased food intake was less likely in male participants (OR, 0.7 [CI 0.6-0.9]) and more likely with increasing BMI (OR, 1.4 [CI 1.3-2.0]), increased sports activity (OR, 1.3 [CI 1.2-1.8]), augmented mental stress (OR 1.4 [1.1-1.7]), and an alteration of alcohol consumption (reduced alcohol amount, OR, 1.4 [CI 1.1-1.7], increased alcohol, OR, 1.9 [CI 1.4-2.5]). Increase in food intake was mainly triggered by consumption of bread (increased in 46.8%, n = 284) and confectionary (increased in 64.4%, n = 389). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown significantly affected eating habits in young adults.

Pregnant and nursing mothers often take vitamin D supplements. Since little is known about the impact of this supplementation on infant gut microbiota, we undertook a study to determine the association between maternal and infant vitamin D supplementation, infant gut microbiota composition and Clostridioides difficile colonization in 1,157 mother-infant pairs of the CHILD (Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development) Cohort Study over 2009-2012. Logistic and MaAsLin regression were employed to assess associations between vitamin D supplementation, and C. difficile colonization, or other gut microbiota, respectively. Sixty-five percent of infants received a vitamin D supplement. Among all infants, infant vitamin D supplementation was associated with a lower abundance of genus Megamonas (q = 0.01) in gut microbiota. Among those exclusively breastfed, maternal prenatal supplementation was associated with lower abundance of Bilophila (q = 0.01) and of Lachnospiraceae (q = 0.02) but higher abundance of Haemophilus (q = 0.02). There were no differences in microbiota composition with vitamin D supplementation among partially and not breastfed infants. Neither infant nor maternal vitamin D supplementation were associated with C. difficile colonization, after adjusting for breastfeeding status and other factors. However, maternal consumption of vitamin-D fortified milk reduced the likelihood of C. difficile colonization in infants (adjustedOR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.19-0.82).

Patients are often extremely frail with multiple comorbidities and so are at high risk of death should they contract COVID-19. This study aims to quantify the effects of COVID-19 on patients presenting with hip fractures to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (NNUH). METHODS: This is a single centre, prospective, observational cohort study of patients over the age of sixty admitted with a hip fracture to NNUH between March 24th and April 22nd, 2020 and comparing them retrospectively with controls in April 2019. Patients were followed up for 30 days; data collected includes demographics, COVID-19 PCR results, date/cause of death and other prognostic indicators. RESULTS: 66 consecutive patients managed for hip fractures were included in the study. 30-day mortality increased from 8.5% in April 2019 to 18.2% in April 2020. The 30-day mortality rate was 80% for those patients who test positive for COVID-19 as an inpatient, and was 13.8% for patients COVID-19 negative and for those who were untested. Those admitted from a healthcare institution were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 and had a higher 30-day mortality (p = 0.04 & p = 0.006, respectively).

However, the molecular mechanisms of antitumor activity and promoting cellular dedifferentiation for reversine have not yet been clearly elucidated. In the present study, it was demonstrated that reversine of 5 µM could induce multinucleated cells through cytokinesis failure rather than just arrested in G2 or M phase. Moreover, reversine reversed the differentiation of sheep fibroblasts into MSC-like style, and notably increased the expression of pluripotent marker genes Oct4 and MSCs-related surface antigens. The fibroblasts treated with reversine could transdifferentiate into all three germ layers cells in vitro. Most importantly, the induced ß-like cells and hepatocytes had similar metabolic functions with normal cells in vivo. In addition, reversine promoted fibroblasts autophagy, ROS accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell apoptosis via the mitochondria mediated intrinsic pathway. The results of high-throughput RNA sequencing showed that most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in Mismatch repair, Nucleotide excision repair and Base excision repair were significantly up-regulated in reversine treated fibroblasts, which means that high concentration of reversine will cause DNA damage and activate the DNA repair mechanism. In summary, reversine can increase the plasticity of sheep fibroblasts and suppress cell growth via the mitochondria mediated intrinsic pathway.","Guo, Yu; Zhu, Huan; Li, Xiangchen; Ma, Caiyun; Sun, Tingting; Wang, Yuanyuan; Wang, Chunjing; Guan, Weijun; Liu, Changqing",Sci Rep,221,10

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), owing to their powerful immunomodulatory abilities, have the potential to attenuate the cytokine storm and have therefore been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for which several clinical trials are underway. Given that intravenous infusion of MSCs results in a significant trapping in the lung, MSC therapy could directly mitigate inflammation, protect alveolar epithelial cells, and reverse lung dysfunction by normalizing the pulmonary microenvironment and preventing pulmonary fibrosis.

METHODS: We conducted targeted surveillance for MIS-C from March 15 to May 20, 2020, in pediatric health centers across the United States. The case definition included six criteria: serious illness leading to hospitalization, an age of less than 21 years, fever that lasted for at least 24 hours, laboratory evidence of inflammation, multisystem organ involvement, and evidence of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), antibody testing, or exposure to persons with Covid-19 in the past month. Clinicians abstracted the data onto standardized forms. RESULTS: We report on 186 patients with MIS-C in 26 states. The median age was 8.3 years, 115 patients (62%) were male, 135 (73%) had previously been healthy, 131 (70%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or antibody testing, and 164 (88%) were hospitalized after April 16, 2020. Organ-system involvement included the gastrointestinal system in 171 patients (92%), cardiovascular in 149 (80%), hematologic in 142 (76%), mucocutaneous in 137 (74%), and respiratory in 131 (70%). The median duration of hospitalization was 7 days (interquartile range, 4 to 10); 148 patients (80%) received intensive care, 37 (20%) received mechanical ventilation, 90 (48%) received vasoactive support, and 4 (2%) died. Coronary-artery aneurysms (z scores &#8805;2.5) were documented in 15 patients (8%), and Kawasaki's disease-like features were documented in 74 (40%). Most patients (171 [92%]) had elevations in at least four biomarkers indicating inflammation.

Patients on immunosuppressive therapy will be amongst the earliest to be vaccinated. Some evidence indicates immunosuppressive therapy inhibits humoral response to the influenza, pneumococcal and hepatitis B vaccines. The degree to which this will translate to impaired COVID-19 vaccine responses is unclear. Other evidence suggests withholding methotrexate for two weeks post vaccination may improve responses. Rituximab has been shown to impair humoral responses for 6 months or longer post administration. Decisions on withholding or interrupting immunosuppressive therapy around COVID-19 vaccination will need to be made prior to the availability of data on specific COVID-19 vaccine response in these patients. With this in mind, this article outlines the existing data on the effect of antirheumatic therapy on vaccine responses in patients with inflammatory arthritis and formulates a possible pragmatic management strategy for COVID-19 vaccination.","Arnold, Jack; Winthrop, Kevin; Emery, Paul",Rheumatology (Oxford),221,16

Neuroendocrine tumour (NET) services are delivered in a highly specialised setting, typically delivered in a small number of centres that fulfil specific criteria as defined by the European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society (ENETS). We aimed to address the COVID-19-related impact on specialist NET tumour services in England and other countries. METHODS: Electronic survey addressing patient access and delivery of care distributed to all ENETS Centres of Excellence (CoE) in England and matching number of ENETS CoE elsewhere. Semi-quantitative and qualitative analyses of survey responses were performed. RESULTS: Survey response of ENETS CoE in England was 55% (6/11). Responses from six non-UK ENETS CoE elsewhere were received and analysed in a similar manner. Relevant disruption of various NET services was noted across all responding Centres, which included delayed patient appointments and investigations, reduced availability of treatment modalities including delayed surgical treatment and a major negative impact on research activities. The comparison between English and non-UK ENETS CoE suggested that the former had significantly greater concerns related to future research funding (p = 0.014), whilst having less disruption to multidisciplinary meetings (p = 0.01). A trend was also noted towards virtual patient appointments in ENETS CoE in England vs. elsewhere (p = 0.092). CONCLUSIONS: Restoration of highly specialised NET services following COVID-19 and planning for future service delivery and research funding must take account of the severe challenges encountered during the pandemic.","Weickert, Martin O; Robbins, Tim; Kyrou, Ioannis; Hopper, Adam; Pearson, Eilish; Barber, Thomas M; Kaltsas, Gregory; Randeva, Harpal S",Endocrine,221,7

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the widespread use of protective face masks. We found that occlusions from cloth face masks increased the mean absolute error of heart rate estimation by more than 80\% when deploying methods designed on unmasked faces. We show that augmenting unmasked face videos by adding patterned synthetic face masks forces the model to attend to the periocular and forehead regions, improving performance and closing the gap between masked and unmasked pulse estimation. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to analyse the impact of face masks on the accuracy of pulse estimation and offers several novel contributions: (a) 3D CNN-based method designed for remote photoplethysmography in a presence of face masks, (b) two publicly available pulse estimation datasets acquired from 86 unmasked and 61 masked subjects, (c) evaluations of handcrafted algorithms and a 3D CNN trained on videos of unmasked faces and with masks synthetically added, and (d) data augmentation method to add a synthetic mask to a face video.","Speth, Jeremy; Vance, Nathan; Flynn, Patrick; Bowyer, Kevin; Czajka, Adam",,221,33

A simple and accurate relation for the fraction of the population that does not catch the disease is also obtained. The explicit time dependences of the susceptibles, infectives and removed populations, as well as that of the epidemic curve are also modelled with good accuracy for any value of R0 (basic multiplication number) using simple functions that are modified solutions of the R0 ->infinity limiting case (logistic curve). It is also shown that for I0<<S0 the effect of a change in the ratio I0/S0 on the population evolution curves amounts to a time shift, their shape and relative position being unaffected.","Berberan-Santos, Mario",,221,16

Using the estimation procedures based on the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity type models (GARCH (1,1), the GJR-GARCH), and the accounting innovation tests, our results show that COVID-19 increases volatility and distorts the positive relationship between inflation and stock market returns, which tends to negate the Fisher's hypothesis. In addition, the results reveal that the negative effects of COVID-19 on the market returns and its disruption to the stock market returns-inflation relationship may not die away rapidly considering that the duration of the pandemic is unknown. Further, these findings are validated by the innovation accounting tests. Therefore, the study presents to policymakers the consequences of COVID-19 and the urgent need to strengthen the market through collaborative efforts.","Jelilov, Gylych; Iorember, Paul Terhemba; Usman, Ojonugwa; Yua, Paul M",J Public Aff,221,16

Methods: This study was a cross sectional survey conducted by means of a confidential on-line survey on 174 Iranian dentists. COVID-19 related questions were divided to three parts: dentists’ perspective about their career future, virus contagion and concerns of getting infected COVID-19 from patients, and paucity of information and facilities to control the spread of the virus. Perceived stress and psychological flexibility were assessed by PSS (Cohen et al., 1983) and CFI (Dennis et al., 2010). To analyze data path analysis method was used. Results: Perceived stress significantly predicted psychological flexibility (both alternatives and control subscales) and COVID-19 factors related to dental work In addition, control subscale significantly predicted dentists’ concerns toward their career future and fear of COVID-19 contagion. Hence, control subscale of cognitive flexibility mediated the relationship of perceived stress and professional concerns of dentists during COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Given these results, elevated stress during an infectious disease outbreak can effect (have impact on) perceived stress and professional concerns among dentists. Different aspects of dentists’ lives can be affected by those concerns and stress. Interventions to enhance the cognitive flexibility should be applied to reduce the psychological burden of the crisis for dentists.","Afshari, Afrooz Hashemikamangar Seyedehsareh Sedighe Sadat Hashemikamangar",Dentistry 3000,221,29

This harm may manifest as a gradual degradation of public discourse; but it can also take the form of sudden dramatic events such as the recent insurrection on Capitol Hill. The platforms themselves are in the best position to prevent the spread of disinformation, as they have the best access to relevant data and the expertise to use it. However, mitigating disinformation is costly, not only for implementing classification algorithms or employing manual detection, but also because limiting such highly viral content impacts user growth and thus potential advertising revenue. Since the costs of harmful content are borne by other entities, the platform will therefore have no incentive to exercise the socially-optimal level of effort. This problem is similar to the problem of environmental regulation, in which the costs of adverse events are not directly borne by a firm, the mitigation effort of a firm is not observable, and the causal link between a harmful consequence and a specific failure is difficult to prove. In the environmental regulation domain, one solution to this issue is to perform costly monitoring to ensure that the firm takes adequate precautions according a specified rule. However, classifying disinformation is performative, and thus a fixed rule becomes less effective over time. Encoding our domain as a Markov decision process, we demonstrate that no penalty based on a static rule, no matter how large, can incentivize adequate effort by the platform. Penalties based on an adaptive rule can incentivize optimal effort, but counterintuitively, only if the regulator sufficiently overreacts to harmful events by requiring a greater-than-optimal level of effort.

We screened a panel of already-approved drugs in a cell culture model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and identified two new agents having higher antiviral potentials than the drug candidates such as Remdesivir and Chroloquine in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells: the anti-inflammatory drug Cepharanthine and HIV protease inhibitor Nelfinavir. Cepharanthine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry through the blocking of viral binding to target cells, whilst Nelfinavir suppressed viral replication partly by protease inhibition. Consistent with their different modes of action, synergistic effect of this combined treatment to limit SARS-CoV-2 proliferation was highlighted. Mathematical modeling in vitro antiviral activity coupled with the calculated total drug concentrations in the lung predicts that Nelfinavir will shorten the period until viral clearance by 4.9-days and the combining Cepharanthine/Nelfinavir enhanced their predicted efficacy. These results warrant further evaluation of the potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of Cepharanthine and Nelfinavir.","Ohashi, Hirofumi; Watashi, Koichi; Saso, Wakana; Shionoya, Kaho; Iwanami, Shoya; Hirokawa, Takatsugu; Shirai, Tsuyoshi; Kanaya, Shigehiko; Ito, Yusuke; Kim, Kwang Su; Nomura, Takao; Suzuki, Tateki; Nishioka, Kazane; Ando, Shuji; Ejima, Keisuke; Koizumi, Yoshiki; Tanaka, Tomohiro; Aoki, Shin; Kuramochi, Kouji; Suzuki, Tadaki; Hashiguchi, Takao; Maenaka, Katsumi; Matano, Tetsuro; Muramatsu, Masamichi; Saijo, Masayuki; Aihara, Kazuyuki; Iwami, Shingo; Takeda, Makoto; McKeating, Jane A; Wakita, Takaji",iScience,221,16

It has affected millions of people and continues to affect more, despite tremendous social preventive measures. Identifying candidate drugs for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is crucial. The pathogenesis and the complications with advanced infection mainly involve an immune-inflammatory cascade. Therefore, therapeutic strategy relies on suppressing infectivity and inflammation, along with immune modulation. One of the most promising therapeutic targets for the modulation of immune-inflammatory responses is the endocannabinoid system, particularly the activation of cannabinoid type 2 receptors (CB2R), a G-protein coupled receptor which mediates the anti-inflammatory properties by modulating numerous signaling pathways. To pharmacologically activate the CB2 receptors, a naturally occurring cannabinoid ligand, beta-caryophyllene (BCP), received attention due to its potent anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunomodulatory properties. BCP is recognized as a full selective functional agonist on CB2 receptors and produces therapeutic effects by activating CB2 and the nuclear receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). BCP is regarded as the first dietary cannabinoid with abundant presence across cannabis and non-cannabis plants, including spices and other edible plants. BCP showed tissue protective properties and favorably modulates numerous signaling pathways and inhibits inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, prostanoids, and eicosanoids. Based on its pharmacological properties, molecular mechanisms, and the therapeutic potential of BCP as an immunomodulator, anti-inflammatory, organ-protective, and antiviral, we hypothesize that BCP could be a promising therapeutic and/or preventive candidate to target the triad of infection, immunity, and inflammation in COVID-19. In line with numerous studies that proposed the potential of cannabinoids in COVID-19, BCP may be a novel candidate compound for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical development due to its unique functional receptor selectivity, wide availability and accessibility, dietary bioavailability, nonpsychoactivity, and negligible toxicity along with druggable properties, including favorable pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties. Based on reasonable pharmacological mechanisms and therapeutic properties, we speculate that BCP has potential to be investigated against COVID-19 and will inspire further preclinical and clinical studies.","Jha, N.

In Sphingobium sp. strain SYK-6, syringate is O demethylated to gallate by consecutive reactions catalyzed by DesA and LigM, and vanillate is O demethylated to protocatechuate by a reaction catalyzed by LigM. The gallate ring is cleaved by DesB, and protocatechuate is catabolized via the protocatechuate 4,5-cleavage pathway. The transcriptions of desA, ligM, and desB are induced by syringate and vanillate, while that of ligM and desB are negatively regulated by the MarR-type transcriptional regulator DesR, which is not involved in desA regulation. Here we clarified the regulatory system for desA transcription by analyzing the IclR-type transcriptional regulator desX, located downstream of desA Quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analyses of a desX mutant indicates that the transcription of desA was negatively regulated by DesX. In contrast, DesX was not involved in the regulation of ligM and desB The ferulate catabolic genes (ferBA) under the control of a MarR-type transcriptional regulator FerC are located upstream of desA RT-PCR analyses suggest that the ferB-ferA-SLG_25010-desA gene cluster consists of the ferBA operon and the SLG_25010-desA operon. Promoter assays reveal that a syringate- and vanillate-inducible promoter is located upstream of SLG_25010. Purified DesX bound to this promoter region, which overlaps with an 18-bp inverted repeat sequence that appears to be essential for the DNA binding of DesX. Syringate and vanillate inhibited the DNA binding of DesX, indicating that these compounds are effector molecules of DesX.IMPORTANCE Syringate is a major degradation product in the microbial and chemical degradation of syringyl lignin. Along with other low-molecular-weight aromatic compounds, syringate is produced by chemical lignin depolymerization. Converting this mixture into value-added chemicals using bacterial metabolism (i.e., biological funneling) is a promising option for lignin valorization. To construct an efficient microbial lignin conversion system, it is necessary to identify and characterize the genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of lignin-derived aromatic compounds and elucidate their transcriptional regulation. In this study, we found that the transcription of desA, encoding syringate O-demethylase in SYK-6, is regulated by an IclR-type of transcriptional regulator, DesX. The findings of this study, combined with our previous results on desR (a MarR transcriptional regulator that controls the transcription of ligM and desB), provide an overall picture of the transcriptional regulatory systems for syringate and vanillate catabolism in SYK-6.","Araki, Takuma; Tanatani, Kenta; Kamimura, Naofumi; Otsuka, Yuichiro; Yamaguchi, Muneyoshi; Nakamura, Masaya; Masai, Eiji",,221,24

However, few methods except the Z-number considered the reliability of information. In this paper, we propose a multi-criterion decision-making method based on the Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory and generalized Z-numbers. To do so, inspired by the concept of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set, we extend the Z-number to a generalized form which is more in line with human expression habits. Afterwards, we make a bridge between the knowledge of Z-numbers and the DS evidence theory to integrate Z-valuations. The identification framework in the DS theory is used to describe the generalized Z-numbers to avoid ambiguity. Then, the knowledge of Z-numbers is used to derive the basic probability assignment of evidence and the synthetic rules in the DS theory are used to integrate evaluations. An illustrative example of medicine selection for the patients with mild symptoms of the COVID-19 is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","Ren, Zongyuan; Liao, Huchang; Liu, Yuxi",Comput Ind Eng,221,23

Consequently, recent research has focused on testing the robustness of such models, resulting in a diverse set of evaluation methodologies ranging from adversarial attacks to rule-based data transformations. In this work, we identify challenges with evaluating NLP systems and propose a solution in the form of Robustness Gym (RG), a simple and extensible evaluation toolkit that unifies 4 standard evaluation paradigms: subpopulations, transformations, evaluation sets, and adversarial attacks. By providing a common platform for evaluation, Robustness Gym enables practitioners to compare results from all 4 evaluation paradigms with just a few clicks, and to easily develop and share novel evaluation methods using a built-in set of abstractions. To validate Robustness Gym's utility to practitioners, we conducted a real-world case study with a sentiment-modeling team, revealing performance degradations of 18%+. To verify that Robustness Gym can aid novel research analyses, we perform the first study of state-of-the-art commercial and academic named entity linking (NEL) systems, as well as a fine-grained analysis of state-of-the-art summarization models.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a negative impact on center-based cardiopulmonary rehabilitation. Justifiable concern exists that the exercise-related increase in pulmonary ventilation within the rehabilitation classes may lead to the generation of infectious respiratory particles. RESEARCH QUESTION: Is cardiopulmonary rehabilitation while wearing a procedural mask a particle-generating procedure? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected prospectively at a cardiopulmonary rehabilitation facility with all patients wearing a procedural mask. Small (0.3-4.9 µm) and large (5-10 µm) particle generation was quantified using a light-scattering particle counter. Data were analyzed by time, exertion level, and number of participants. RESULTS: A total of 24 distinct patients attended two or more of the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation classes tested. Most of the patients were men (n = 16 [67%]) and were in rehabilitation because of cardiac disease. During the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation class, small and large micrometer-size particles increased with increasing class size. In classes with four patients or more, a significant increase was found from ambient levels in both small (four patients, P < .01; and five patients, P < .01) and large (four patients, P < .01; and five patients, P < .01) particle count that peaked at about 35 to 40 min during each class. INTERPRETATION: Using an airborne particle counter, we found significant exercise-related increases in both small and large micrometer-size particle generation during cardiopulmonary rehabilitation classes, with larger class sizes (ie, more patients), despite participants wearing a procedural mask.","Helgeson, Scott A; Taylor, Bryan J; Lim, Kaiser G; Lee, Augustine S; Niven, Alexander S; Patel, Neal M",Chest,221,20

We hereby present the imprints of lockdown on water quality (both chemical and biological) parameters during the nationwide lockdown (COVID-19 epidemic) in India between 25th March to 30th May 2020. The present study describes the changes in chemical and biological water quality parameters based on twenty-two groundwater samples from the coastal industrial city of Tuticorin in Southern India, taken before (10 and 11th February 2020) and during the lockdown (19 and 20th April 2020) periods. The physico-chemical parameters compared are pH, total dissolved solids (TDS) and electrical conductivity (EC), nitrate (NO3), fluoride (F), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), and selenium (Se), and the bacterial parameters are total coliforms, fecal coliforms, E. coli, and fecal streptococci. Among the metals, the significant reductions in Se (42%), As (51%), Fe (60%) and Pb (50%) were noticed probably owing to no or very less wastewater discharges from metal-based industries, seafood-based industries and thermal power plants during the lockdown. Reduction in NO3 (56%), total coliform (52%) and fecal coliforms (48%) indicated less organic sewage from the fishing industries. Contents of Cr, Cu, Zn and Cd, however, remained similar and fluoride did not show any change, probably as they were sourced from rock-water interactions. Similarly, we did not observe alterations in E. coli and fecal streptococci due to no significant change in domestic sewage production during the lockdown. The multivariate analyses aptly illustrated this and the principal component analyses helped to identify the sources that controlled water qualities of the lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown period. Our observation implies that groundwater is definitely under active interaction with surface waters and thus a quick revival could be observed following the seizing of anthropogenic activities.","Selvam, S; Jesuraja, K; Venkatramanan, S; Chung, S Y; Roy, P D; Muthukumar, P; Kumar, Manish",Sci Total Environ,221,16

Particularly vulnerable households include dual health care professional households, single-parent health care professional households, and households with health care professionals responsible for a high-risk family member (i.e., an older adult or immunocompromised person). While the demographics of these households are heterogeneous, it is expected that the professional and personal concerns specific to COVID-19 will be similar. These concerns include family safety, balancing full-time work with home-based schooling for children, the looming threat of illness to one or both partners, the potential of infecting high-risk family members, and the challenges of planning for the future during uncertain times. To elucidate these concerns in their department, the authors sought input from colleagues in dual health care professional households through an open-ended email communication. Respondents expressed a range of concerns centered on balancing professional and family responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this commentary, the authors propose several recommendations in the areas of support networks, leadership and culture, and operations and logistics that health care institutions can adopt to minimize the burden on these vulnerable households during states of emergency. The successful implementation of these recommendations hinges on creating a work environment in which all health care providers feel comfortable voicing their concerns.","Donroe, Joseph H; Rabin, Tracy L; Hsieh, Evelyn; Schwartz, Jeremy I",Acad. med,221,18

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) attacks the respiratory system, causing pneumonia and lymphopenia in infected individuals. The aim of the present study is to investigate the laboratory characteristics of the viral load, lymphocyte subset and cytokines in asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison with those in symptomatic patients with COVID-19. METHODS: From January 24, 2020, to April 11, 2020, 48 consecutive subjects were enrolled in this study. Viral loads were detected by RT-PCR from throat-swab, sputum and feces samples. Lymphocyte subset levels of CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD8 + T lymphocytes, B cells and NK cells were determined with biological microscope and flow cytometric analysis. Plasma cytokines (IL2, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL8, IL10, TNF-&#945;, IFN-&#945; and IFN-Î³) were detected using flow cytometer. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), Chi-square or Fisher's exact test and Pearson's Correlation assay was used for all data. RESULTS: Asymptomatic (AS), mild symptoms (MS) and severe or critical cases (SCS) with COVID-19 were 11 (11/48, 22.9%), 26 (54.2%, 26/48) and 11 cases (11/48, 22.9%), respectively. The mean age of AS group (47.3 years) was lower than SCS group (63.5 years) (P < 0.05). Diabetes mellitus in AS, MS and SCS patients with COVID-19 were 0, 6 and 5 cases, respectively, and there was a significant difference between AS and SCS (P < 0.05). No statistical differences were found in the viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 between AS, MS and SCS groups on admission to hospital and during hospitalization. The concentration of CD 3 + T cells (P < 0.05), CD3 + CD4 + T cells (P < 0.05), CD3 + CD8 + T cells (P < 0.01), and B cells (P < 0.05) in SCS patients was lower than in AS and MS patients, while the level of IL-5 (P < 0.05), IL-6 (P < 0.05), IL-8 (P < 0.01) and IL-10 (P < 0.01), and TNF-&#945; (P < 0.05) was higher. The age was negatively correlated with CD3 + T cells (P < 0.05), CD3 + CD4 + T cells (P < 0.05), and positively correlated with IL-2 (P < 0.001), IL-5 (P < 0.05), IL-6 (P < 0.05) IL-8 (P < 0.05), and IL-10 (P < 0.05). The viral loads were positively correlated with IL-2 (P < 0.001), IL-5 (P < 0.05), IL-6 (P < 0.05) IL-8 (P < 0.05) and IL-10 (P < 0.05), while negatively correlated with CD 3 + T cells (P < 0.05) and CD3 + CD4 + T cells (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The viral loads are similar between asymptomatic, mild and severe or critical patients with COVID-19. The severity of COVID-19 may be related to underlying diseases such as diabetes mellitus. Lymphocyte subset and plasma cytokine levels may be as the markers to distinguish severely degrees of disease, and asymptomatic patients may be as an important source of infection for the COVID-19.","Yin, Shi-Wei; Zhou, Zheng; Wang, Jun-Ling; Deng, Yun-Feng; Jing, Hui; Qiu, Yi",Virol J,221,1

Poor glycemic control is also associated with poor patient outcomes (eg, hospitalization and death). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with diabetes who were admitted to our hospital for COVID-19 treatment. METHODS: This cross-sectional, observational study comprised patients with diabetes admitted with COVID-19 to Mediclinic Parkview Hospital in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, from March 30 to June 7, 2020. We studied the differences among characteristics, length of hospital stay, diabetes status, comorbidities, treatments, and outcomes among these patients. RESULTS: Of the cohort patients, 25.1% (103/410) had coexistent diabetes or prediabetes. These patients represented 17 different ethnicities, with 59.2% (61/103) from Asian countries and 35% (36/103) from Arab countries. Mean patient age was 54 (SD 12.5) years, and 66.9% (69/103) of patients were male. Moreover, 85.4% (88/103) of patients were known to have diabetes prior to admission, and 14.6% (15/103) were newly diagnosed with either diabetes or prediabetes at admission. Most cohort patients had type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, and only 2.9% (3/103) of all patients had type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, 44.6% (46/103) of patients demonstrated evidence suggesting good glycemic control during the 4-12 weeks prior to admission, as defined arbitrarily by admission hemoglobin A1c level <7.5%, and 73.8% (76/103) of patients had other comorbidities, including hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and dyslipidemia. Laboratory data (mean and SD values) at admission for patients who needed ward-based care versus those who needed intensive care were as follows: fibrinogen, 462.8 (SD 125.1) mg/dL vs 660.0 (SD 187.6) mg/dL; D-dimer, 0.7 (SD 0.5) µg/mL vs 2.3 (SD 3.5) µg/mL; ferritin, 358.0 (SD 442.0) mg/dL vs 1762.4 (SD 2586.4) mg/dL; and C-reactive protein, 33.9 (SD 38.6) mg/L vs 137.0 (SD 111.7) mg/L. Laboratory data were all significantly higher for patients in the intensive care unit subcohort (P<.05). The average length of hospital stay was 14.55 days for all patients, with 28.2% (29/103) of patients requiring intensive care. In all, 4.9% (5/103) died during hospitalization-all of whom were in the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: Majority of patients with diabetes or prediabetes and COVID-19 had other notable comorbidities. Only 4 patients tested negative for COVID-19 RT-PCR but showed pathognomonic changes of COVID-19 radiologically. Laboratory analyses revealed distinct abnormal patterns of biomarkers that were associated with a poor prognosis: fibrinogen, D-dimer, ferritin, and C-reactive protein levels were all significantly higher at admission in patients who subsequently needed intensive care than in those who needed ward-based care. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to compare data of COVID-19 patients admitted with and without diabetes within the UAE region.","Bhatti, Rahila; Khamis, Amar Hassan; Khatib, Samara; Shiraz, Seemin; Matfin, Glenn",JMIR Public Health Surveill,221,1

The purpose of this study is to investigate the risk factors and predictive value of deterioration on repeatedly performed CT scan during hospitalization.All COVID-19 patients treated in our isolation ward, from January 22, 2020 to February 7, 2020, were reviewed. Patients included were categorized into RD (Radiological Deterioration) group or NRD (No Radiological Deterioration) group according to the manifestation on the CT routinely performed during the hospitalization. All clinical data and CT images were analyzed.Forty three patients were included in our study. All are moderate cases with at least 4 CT scans each. Eighteen (42.9%) patients had radiological deteriorations which were all identified in CT2 (the first CT after admission). Patients in RD group had lower leukocyte count (Pâ=â.003), lymphocyte count (Pâ=â.030), and higher prevalence (Pâ=â.012) of elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at admission. NRD patients had a lower prevalence of reticulations (Pâ=â.034) on baseline CT (CT1, performed within 2âdays before admission) and a longer duration between symptom onset and the time of CT2 (Pâ<â.01). There was no significant difference in hospital stay or fibrotic change on CT4 (follow-up CT scan performed 4âweeks after discharge) between 2 groups. Shorter duration between symptom onset and CT2 time (odds ratio [OR], 0.436; 95% confidence interval: 0.233-0.816; Pâ<â.01) and lower leukocyte count in baseline evaluation (OR, 0.316; 95% CI: 0.116-0.859; Pâ<â.05) were associated with increased odds of radiological deterioration on CT image during hospitalization.For moderate COVID-19 patients, the value of routinely performed CT during the treatment is limited.

Nepal has been severely affected by it, with an increasing number of confirmed cases and casualties in recent days, even after 8 months of the first case detected in China. As of 26 November 2020, there were over 227,600 confirmed cases of COVID in Nepal with 209,435 recovered cases and 1,412 deaths. This study aimed to compile public data available from the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP), Government of Nepal (GoN) and analyse the data of 104 deceased COVID-19 patients using IBM SPSS (Version 25.0). Additionally, this study also aimed to provide critical insights on response of the GoN to COVID-19 and way forward to confront unprecedented pandemic. Figures and maps were created using the Origin Lab (Version 2018) and QGIS (Version 3.10.8). Most of the reported cases were from Bagmati Province, the location of Nepal's capital city, Kathmandu. Among deceased cases, >69% of the patients were male and patients &#8805;54 years accounted for 67.9% (n = 923). Preliminary findings showed respiratory illness, diabetes, and chronic kidney diseases were the most common comorbid conditions associated with COVID-19 deaths in Nepal. Despite some efforts in the 8 months since the first case was detected, the government's response so far has been insufficient. Since the government eased the lockdown in July 2020, Nepal is facing a flood of COVID-19 cases. If no aggressive actions are taken, the epidemic is likely to result in significant morbidity and mortality in Nepal. The best way to curb the effect of the ongoing pandemic in a resource-limited country like Nepal is to increase testing, tracing, and isolation capacity, and to set up quality quarantine centers throughout the nation. A comprehensive health literacy campaign, quality care of older adults and those with comorbidity will also result in the effective management of the ongoing pandemic.","Rayamajhee, Binod; Pokhrel, Anil; Syangtan, Gopiram; Khadka, Saroj; Lama, Bhupendra; Rawal, Lal Bahadur; Mehata, Suresh; Mishra, Shyam Kumar; Pokhrel, Roshan; Yadav, Uday Narayan",Front Public Health,221,16

We aimed to assess the differences between COVID-19 and other influenza like illnesses in disease burden brought by isolation. We conducted an online questionnaire survey of 302 people who had COVID-19 or other influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) and compared the burden of isolation due to sickness with one-to-one propensity score matching. The primary outcomes are the duration and productivity losses of isolation, the secondary outcome is quality of life (QOL) valuation on the day of the survey. Acute symptoms of outpatient COVID-19 and other ILIs lasted 17 (interquartile range [IQR] 9-32) and 7 (IQR 4-10) days, respectively. The length of isolation due to COVID-19 was 18 (IQR 10-33) days and that due to other ILIs was 7 (IQR 4-11) days, respectively. The monetary productivity loss of isolation due to COVID-19 was 1424.3 (IQR 825.6-2545.5) USD and that due to other ILIs was 606.1 (IQR 297.0-1090.9) USD, respectively. QOL at the time of the survey was lower in the COVID-19 group than in the ""other ILIs"" group (0.89 and 0.96, p = 0.001). COVID-19 infection imposes a substantial disease burden, even in patients with non-severe disease. This burden is larger for COVID-19 than other ILIs, mainly because the required isolation period is longer.","Tsuzuki, Shinya; Ohmagari, Norio; Beutels, Philippe",,221,15

There is minimal information on potential co-pathogens in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in the US. We analyzed pathogens, antimicrobial use, and healthcare utilization in hospitalized US patients with and without severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included patients with > 1 day of inpatient admission and discharge/death between March 1 and May 31, 2020 at 241 US acute care hospitals in the BD Insights Research Database. We assessed microbiological testing data, antimicrobial utilization in admitted patients with &#8805;24 h of antimicrobial therapy, and length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: A total of 141,621 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 (17,003 [12.0%] positive) and 449,339 patients were not tested. Most (> 90%) patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 had additional microbiologic testing performed compared with 41.9% of SARS-CoV-2-untested patients. Non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogen rates were 20.9% for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients compared with 21.3 and 27.9% for SARS-CoV-2-negative and -untested patients, respectively. Gram-negative bacteria were the most common pathogens (45.5, 44.1, and 43.5% for SARS-CoV-2-positive, -negative, and -untested patients). SARS-CoV-2-positive patients had higher rates of hospital-onset (versus admission-onset) non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogens compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative or -untested patients (42.4, 22.2, and 19.5%, respectively), more antimicrobial usage (68.0, 45.2, and 25.1% of patients), and longer hospital LOS (mean [standard deviation (SD)] of 8.6 [11.4], 5.1 [8.9], and 4.2 [8.0] days) and intensive care unit (ICU) LOS (mean [SD] of 7.8 [8.5], 3.6 [6.2], and 3.6 [5.9] days). For all groups, the presence of a non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogen was associated with increased hospital LOS (mean [SD] days for patients with versus without a non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogen: 13.7 [15.7] vs 7.3 [9.6] days for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, 8.2 [11.5] vs 4.3 [7.9] days for SARS-CoV-2-negative patients, and 7.1 [11.0] vs 3.9 [7.4] days for SARS-CoV-2-untested patients). CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar rates of non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogens in SARS-CoV-2-positive, -negative, and -untested patients, SARS-CoV-2 was associated with higher rates of hospital-onset infections, greater antimicrobial usage, and extended hospital and ICU LOS. This finding highlights the heavy burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare systems and suggests possible opportunities for diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship.","Puzniak, Laura; Finelli, Lyn; Yu, Kalvin C; Bauer, Karri A; Moise, Pamela; De Anda, Carisa; Vankeepuram, Latha; Sepassi, Aryana; Gupta, Vikas",BMC Infect Dis,221,22

Using GS/BS patients as nature's experiments, we found them to be a human model of endogenous Ang II antagonism with activated Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS), resulting in high Ang II levels with blunted cardiovascular effects. These patients are also characterized by increased and directly correlated levels of both Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Ang 1-7. Understanding the myriad of distinctive and frequently overlapping clinical presentations of GS/BS arises remains challenging. Efforts to find a treatment for COVID-19 has fueled a recent surge in interest in chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and its effects. Of specific interest are chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine's ability to inhibit SARS-CoV infection by impairing ACE2, the SARS-CoV2 entry point, through terminal glycosylation via effects on TGN/post-Golgi pH homeostasis. Several different studies with a GS or a BS phenotype, along with a nonsyndromic form of X-linked intellectual disability linked to a mutated SLC9A7, provide additional evidence that specific gene defects can act via misregulation of TGN/post-Golgi pH homeostasis, which leads to a common mechanistic basis resulting in overlapping phenotypes. We suggest that linkage between the specific gene defects identified in GS and BS and the myriad of distinctive and frequently overlapping clinical findings may be the result of aberrant glycosylation of ACE2 driven by altered TGN/endosome system acidification caused by the metabolic alkalosis brought about by these salt-losing tubulopathies in addition to their altered intracellular calcium signaling due to a blunted second messenger induced intracellular calcium release that is, in turn, amplified by the RAS system.","Calò, Lorenzo A; Davis, Paul A",,221,1

The coronavirus 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) enzyme is essential for proteolytic maturation of the virus. This study was based on immunoinformatics and structural vaccinology strategies. The design of the multiepitope vaccine was built using helper T-cell and cytotoxic T-cell epitopes from the 3CL hydrolase protein along with an adjuvant to enhance immune response; these are joined to each other by short peptide linkers. The vaccine also carries potential B-cell linear epitope regions, B-cell discontinuous epitopes, and interferon-Î³-inducing epitopes. Epitopes of the constructed multiepitope vaccine were found to be antigenic, nonallergic, nontoxic, and covering large human populations worldwide. The vaccine construct was modeled, validated, and refined by different programs to achieve a high-quality three-dimensional structure. The resulting high-quality model was applied for conformational B-cell epitope selection and docking analyses with toll-like receptor-3 for understanding the capability of the vaccine to elicit an immune response. In silico cloning and codon adaptation were also performed with the pET-19b plasmid vector.

This paper uses data from a sample survey of migrant workers to come up with useful parameters for estimating the potential losses from possible retrenchment of migrant workers due to the pandemic. The paper employs a simple estimation model using parameters derived from data collected from a KNOMAD-ILO survey of low-skilled migrant workers in the India-Saudi Arabia migration corridor, conducted during 2016-2017. An important finding is that the aggregate losses that low-skilled Indian workers in Saudi Arabia are likely to incur due to COVID-19-related retrenchment may be as high as 21% of their expected earnings. Adding recruitment costs can push up their losses to 36% of expected or potential earnings, while the aggregate remittances to their families could drop by USD 2 billion.","Abella, Manolo I; Sasikumar, S K",Indian J Labour Econ,221,16

We aimed to examine the impact of these unprecedented changes on the formal education of paediatric cardiology fellows through a nationwide survey. A REDCap&#8482;-based voluntary anonymous survey was sent to all current paediatric cardiology fellows in the United States of America in May, 2020. Of 143 respondents, 121 were categorical fellows, representing over one-fourth of all categorical paediatric cardiology fellows in the United States of America. Nearly all (140/143, 97.9%) respondents utilised online learning during the pandemic, with 134 (93.7%) reporting an increase in use compared to pre-pandemic. The percentage of respondents reporting curriculum supplementation with outside lectures increased from 11.9 to 88.8% during the pandemic. Respondents considered online learning to be ""equally or more effective"" than in-person lectures in convenience (133/142, 93.7%), improving fellow attendance (132/142, 93.0%), improving non-fellow attendance (126/143, 88.1%), and meeting individual learning needs (101/143, 70.6%). The pandemic positively affected the lecture curriculum of 83 respondents (58.0%), with 35 (24.5%) reporting no change and 25 (17.5%) reporting a negative effect. A positive effect was most noted by those whose programmes utilised supplemental outside lectures (62.2 versus 25.0%, p = 0.004) and those whose lecture frequency did not decrease (65.1 versus 5.9%, p < 0.001). Restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic have greatly increased utilisation of online learning platforms by medical training programmes. This survey reveals that an online lecture curriculum, despite inherent obstacles, offers advantages that may mitigate some negative consequences of the pandemic on fellowship education.","Ganigara, Madhusudan; Sharma, Chetan; Molina Berganza, Fernando; Joshi, Krittika; Blaufox, Andrew D; Hayes, Denise A",Cardiol Young,221,26

Social isolation is known to have a significant psychological impact, potentially triggering alcohol misuse in adults. In our study, we aimed to investigate the effect of COVID-19 lockdown measures on alcohol consumption in adults in Bavaria. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 2067 participants, with 1961 young adults (mean age 23.3 ± 4.1) and 106 mature adults (mean age 66.7 ± 9.7). Participants were asked to complete a standardized questionnaire, semi-quantitatively evaluating the alcohol drinking behaviour before and during the pandemic lockdown. RESULTS: After implementation of lockdown, the alteration of alcohol consumption was significantly different between young and mature adults (p < 0.001). Among young adults, 42% reported unchanged drinking behaviour compared to 76% in the mature adult group; 44% of young adults reported to drink less compared to only 7% of mature adults. An increase in alcohol consumption was only reported by 14% of young adults and 17% of mature adults. Interestingly, in the entire cohort, the change of alcohol intake was most pronounced among moderate drinkers (> 0 to < 5 drinks/week) in both age groups (p < 0.001). Ordinal logistic regression revealed female sex, low BMI and younger age to be associated with a decrease in number of self-reported drinks/week. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown significantly affected alcohol drinking behaviour. Further studies exploring long-term effects on potential alcohol misuse and the relevance on public health are warranted.

Several risk factors that increase COVID-19 severity have emerged, including age and a history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or kidney disease. However, a number of outstanding questions persist, including whether the above comorbidities correlate with increased mortality from COVID-19 or whether age is a significant confounding variable that accounts for the observed relationship between COVID-19 severity and other comorbidities. Methods and Findings: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies documenting COVID-19 patients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or chronic kidney disease. We classified COVID-19 cases into severe/non-severe or deceased/surviving and calculated the odds ratio (OR) for each of the four comorbidities in these cohorts. 36 studies, comprising 22,573 patients, are included in our meta-analysis. We found that hypertension is the most prevalent comorbidity in deceased COVID-19 patients (55.4%; CI: 49.4 - 61.3%), followed by cardiovascular disease (30.7%; CI: 22.6 - 38.8%), cerebrovascular disease (13.4%; CI: 9.12- 19.2%), then chronic kidney disease (9.05%; CI: 5.57-15.0%). The risk of death is also significantly higher for patients with these comorbidities, with the greatest risk factor being chronic kidney disease (OR: 8.86; CI: 5.27-14.89), followed by cardiovascular disease (OR: 6.87; CI: 5.56-8.50), hypertension (OR: 4.87; CI: 4.19-5.66), and cerebrovascular disease (OR: 4.28; CI: 2.86-6.41). These risks are significantly higher than previously reported, while correlations between comorbidities and COVID-19 severity are similar to previously reported figures. Using meta-regression analysis with age as a moderating variable, we observed that age contributes to the observed risks but does not explain them fully. Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, we observed that cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and kidney-related comorbidities in COVID-19 significantly contributes to greater risk of mortality and increased disease severity. We also demonstrated that age may not be a confounder to these associations.","Lee, Abby C; Tse Li, Wei; Apostol, Lauren; Ma, Jiayan; Taub, Pam R; Chang, Eric Y; Rajasekaran, Mahadevan; Ongkeko, Weg M",,221,21

METHODS: A 64-year-old man came to our attention because of blurred vision after a 2-month hospital stay for treatment of COVID-19 infection. Examination findings revealed PACG, with severe visual impairment in the right eye and PAC in the left eye due to plateau iris syndrome. The patient's severe clinical condition and prolonged systemic therapy masked the symptoms and delayed the diagnosis. Medical chart review disclosed the multifactorial causes of the visual impairment. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) aided in diagnosis and subsequent therapy. RESULTS: The cause behind the primary angle closure and the iridotrabecular contact was eliminated by bilateral cataract extraction, goniosynechialysis, and myotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 treatment may pose an increased risk for PAC. Accurate recording of patient and family ophthalmic history is essential to prevent its onset.

Maintaining oxygen homeostasis represents the essential cellular metabolic process for the structural integrity of tissues in different pathological conditions, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. Considering the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) as regulator of cellular response to hypoxia and its involvement in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, glucose metabolism, inflammation, we propose hypoxic preconditiong (HPC) as a novel prevention therapeutic approach on healthy contacts of COVID-19 patients. To date, several studies revealed the benefic effects of hypoxic preconditioning in ischemia, kidney failure and in pulmonary function recovery of lung surgery patients. HPC increases the expression of factors that promote cell survival and angiogenesis, induces an anti-inflammatory outcome, triggers coordinated hypoxia responses that promote erythropoiesis, and mobilizes the circulating progenitor cells. Futhermore, the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) exposed to HPC show improvement of their regenerative capacities, and increases the effectiveness of stem cell therapy in different pathologies, including COVID-19. In conclusion, HPC should be considered an approach with beneficial outcomes and without significant side effects when the organism is severely exposed to the same stressor. HPC appears as a trigger to mechanisms that improve and maintain tissue oxygenation and repair, a main goal in different pathologies, including COVID-19 or other respiratory conditions.","Hertzog, Radu Gabriel; Bicheru, Nicoleta Simona; Popescu, Diana Mihaela; Calborean, Octavian; Catrina, Ana-Maria",Int. j. infect. dis,221,29

However, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of specific NPIs has been inconsistent. We assessed the effectiveness of NPIs around internal containment and closure, international travel restrictions, economic measures, and health system actions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 130 countries and territories. METHODS: We used panel (longitudinal) regression to estimate the effectiveness of 13 categories of NPIs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission using data from January to June 2020. First, we examined the temporal association between NPIs using hierarchical cluster analyses. We then regressed the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 against different NPIs. We examined different model specifications to account for the temporal lag between NPIs and changes in Rt, levels of NPI intensity, time-varying changes in NPI effect, and variable selection criteria. Results were interpreted taking into account both the range of model specifications and temporal clustering of NPIs. RESULTS: There was strong evidence for an association between two NPIs (school closure, internal movement restrictions) and reduced Rt. Another three NPIs (workplace closure, income support, and debt/contract relief) had strong evidence of effectiveness when ignoring their level of intensity, while two NPIs (public events cancellation, restriction on gatherings) had strong evidence of their effectiveness only when evaluating their implementation at maximum capacity (e.g. restrictions on 1000+ people gathering were not effective, restrictions on < 10 people gathering were). Evidence about the effectiveness of the remaining NPIs (stay-at-home requirements, public information campaigns, public transport closure, international travel controls, testing, contact tracing) was inconsistent and inconclusive. We found temporal clustering between many of the NPIs. Effect sizes varied depending on whether or not we included data after peak NPI intensity. CONCLUSION: Understanding the impact that specific NPIs have had on SARS-CoV-2 transmission is complicated by temporal clustering, time-dependent variation in effects, and differences in NPI intensity.

Within the Medicine for the Elderly wards at Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) in Dundee, we identified an inefficient process of information-sharing between the orthopaedics outpatient department (OPD) at the main teaching hospital and our hospital's rehabilitation teams, and sought to improve this by introducing several changes to the work system. Our aim was for all patients who attended the OPD clinic to have a plan communicated to the RVH team within 24 hours.Before our intervention, clinic letters containing important instructions for ongoing rehabilitation were dictated by the OPD team, transcribed and uploaded to an electronic system before the RVH team could access them. We analysed clinic attendances over a 4-week period and found that it took 15 days on average for letters to be shared with the RVH teams. We worked with both teams to develop a clinical communication tool and new processes, aiming to expedite the sharing of key information. Patients attended the OPD with this form, the clinician completed it at the time of their appointment and the form returned with the patient to RVH on the same day.We completed multiple Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles; before our project was curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. During our study period, seven patients attended the OPD with a form, with all seven returning to RVH with a completed treatment plan documented by the OPD clinician. This allowed rehabilitation teams to have access to clinic instructions generated by orthopaedic surgeons almost immediately after a patient attended the clinic, essentially eliminating the delay in information-sharing.The introduction of a simple communication tool and processes to ensure reliable transfer of information can expedite information-sharing between secondary care teams and can potentially reduce delays in rehabilitation.","Testrow, Sean; McGovern, Ryan; Tully, Vicki",,221,1

This additional burden can prevent achieving the global targets of TB elimination. Management of LTBI has been a low priority target for National TB Elimination Programs (NTEP) due to various challenges in the field settings. Areas covered: This article reviews the most recent advances in the field of LTBI management including newer diagnostics, treatments, vaccines, programmatic challenges, and gaps and suggests a way forward that can be adopted by NTEPs for LTBI. We searched the electronic databases of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published between 2010 to 2020 using MeSH terms: Latent TB Diagnosis, TB preventive therapy, Vaccines, LTBI, and HIV/ COVID. Expert opinion: NTEPs of developing countries should offer a better, point-of-care diagnostic, and effective treatment for LTBI to reduce the number of new TB cases arising from people infected with M.tb. Awareness about LTBI should be increased among the health system staff and the public. More funding is needed to advance research as well as implement the newer findings in the NTEP to achieve the End TB targets by 2035.","Padmapriyadarsini, Chandrasekaran; Sachdeva, Kuldeep S; Nair, Dina; Ramachandran, Ranjani",Expert rev. respir. med,221,13

Unfortunately, there is currently no specific drug or treatment for COVID-19. Among all structural proteins in SARS-CoV, the spike protein is the main antigenic component responsible for inducing host immune responses, neutralizing antibodies, and/or protecting immunity against virus infection. Molecular docking is a technique used to predict whether a molecule will bind to another. It is usually a protein to another or a protein to a binding compound. Natural products are potential binders in several studies involving coronavirus. The structure of the ligand plays a fundamental role in its biological properties. The nuclear magnetic resonance technique is one of the most powerful tools for the structural determination of ligands from the origin of natural products. Nowadays, molecular modeling is an important accessory tool to experimentally got nuclear magnetic resonance data. In the present work, molecular docking studies aimed is to investigate the limiting affinities of trans-dehydrocrotonin molecule and to identify the main amino acid residues that could play a fundamental role in their mechanism of action of the SARS-CoV spike protein. Another aim of this work is all about to evaluate 10 hybrid functionalities, along with three base pairs using computational programs to discover which ones are more reliable with the experimental result the best computational method to study organic compounds. We compared the results between the mean absolute deviation (MAD) and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the molecules, and the smallest number between them was the best result. The positions assumed by the ligands in the active site of the spike glycoprotein allow assuming associations with different local amino acids.","Cardoso, Evani Ferreira; Giacomello, Thaís Forest; Rocha de Oliveira, Leandro Leal; da Silva, Tiago Arouche; de Jesus Chaves Neto, Antonio Maia; Da Silva Mota, Gunar Vingre; Souza Siqueira, Marcelo Ricardo; Paranhos Costa, Fabio Luiz",J Nanosci Nanotechnol,221,16

STUDY DESIGN: We included all children presenting with MIS-C at a single center with 3 or more ECGs taken during the course of their illness. We measured ECG intervals (PR, QRSd, and QTc) and amplitudes (R-, S-, and T-waves) on each ECG and documented any arrhythmias and ST-segment changes. RESULTS: A majority of children (n = 42, 67%) showed ECG changes. The most common findings were low QRS amplitudes and transient T-wave inversion. ST changes were uncommon and included ST-segment elevation consistent with pericarditis in 1 child and acute coronary ischemia in 1 child. Arrhythmias were seen in 13 children (21%) but were benign with the exception of 1 child who was compromised by an atrial tachycardia requiring support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

This manuscript aimed to provide brief guidance for respiratory management of COVID-19 patients before, during, and after mechanical ventilation, based on the recent literature and on our direct experience with this population.

Each phenotype can benefit from different treatments and ventilator settings. Also, peripheral macro- and microemboli are common, and attention should be paid to the risk of pulmonary embolism.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Research was conducted according to the STROBE guidelines. The study group consisted of 21 patients with a mean age of 16 years. High-resolution cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) was performed at least 1 year after grafting. The experimental side was the cleft side, and the contralateral side without a congenital cleft was the control. Measurements were performed at four levels of the maxillary central incisors' roots according to the new scale with scores from 0 to 3. The sum of the scores provided a general assessment of bone architecture. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for intergroup comparisons, and a Kappa coefficient was used for reproducibility measurements. RESULTS: High individual variability was found, and the bone architecture was significantly worse on the cleft side than on the noncleft side. The results showed 28.57% failure, 33.33% poor, 19.05% moderate, and 19.05% good results from the surgical procedure. Kappa coefficients produced results from 0.92 to 1.00 for intra-rater and from 0.81 to 1.00 for inter-rater reproducibility. CONCLUSIONS: CBCT provides detailed information about alveolar bone morphology. The new assessment method is useful at every treatment stage and provides excellent repeatability. SABG did not provide good bone morphology, in most cases.

The mean duration of ICU stay was 18.83 days (14.33). The neurological conditions recorded were acute confusional syndrome in 28 patients (93.33%), neuromuscular disease in 15 (50%), headache in 5 (16.66%), cerebrovascular disease in 4 (13.33%), and encephalopathies/encephalitis in 4 (13.33%). CSF analysis results were normal in 6 patients (20%). Brain MRI or head CT showed alterations in 20 patients (66.6%). EEG was performed in all patients (100%), with 8 (26.66%) showing abnormal findings. In 5 of the 15 patients with clinical myopathy, diagnosis was confirmed with electroneuromyography. We found a correlation between older age and duration of ICU stay (P=.002; 95%CI: 4.032-6.022; OR: 3,594). CONCLUSIONS: Severe COVID-19 mainly affects men, as observed in other series. Half of our patients presented acute myopathy, and almost all patients left the ICU with acute confusional syndrome, which fully resolved; no correlation was found with EEG or neuroimaging findings. Older age is associated with longer ICU stay.","Abenza-Abildúa, M J; Ramírez-Prieto, M T; Moreno-Zabaleta, R; Arenas-Valls, N; Salvador-Maya, M A; Algarra-Lucas, C; Rojo Moreno-Arrones, B; Sánchez-Cordón, B; Ojeda-Ruíz de Luna, J; Jimeno-Montero, C; Navacerrada-Barrero, F J; Borrue-Fernández, C; Malmierca-Corral, E; Ruíz-Seco, P; González-Ruano, P; Palmí-Cortés, I; Fernández-Travieso, J; Mata-Álvarez de Santullano, M; Almarcha-Menargues, M L; Gutierrez-Gutierrez, G; Palacios-Castaño, J A; Alonso-Esteban, R; Gonzalo-García, N; Pérez-López, C",Neurologia,221,16

To provide reference for the training of emergency surgical nurses during the outbreak of COVID-19. Design: Guided by Kirkpatrick's model, 35 nurses in the emergency surgery department were trained according to a program that resulted from the clinical demand during the pandemic. The trainees were observed in terms of their performance at reaction level and learning level. Results: At reaction level, the degree of satisfaction scored by nurses was relatively high, with its total score achieving (18.77 ± 3.09). At learning level, the differences between theoretical and operational scores of tested nurses before and after training proved to be statistically significant (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The application of Kirkpatrick's model based on clinical demand during the COVID-19 confirms to be effective for the training program of nurses in the emergency surgery department. It is also beneficial to improve nurses' knowledge and skills during the pandemic, which serves as a positive influence for clinical reference.","Li, Zheying; Cheng, Jing; Zhou, Ting; Wang, Sa; Huang, Sufang; Wang, Hui",Telemed J E Health,221,16

Moreover, to explore the impact of spectacles, contact lenses and visual acuity on the compliance to the facemask directive. METHODS: This is a prospective study that was conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Greece between June 2020 and August 2020. Greek speaking citizens with permanent residency in Greece above 18 years old were included. A custom questionnaire (DeMask-20) was constructed and validated, which pertained to the perceived difficulty and discomfort when using a facemask. It contained 20 items grouped in 8 subscales (driving, near vision, distance vision, ocular discomfort, role limitation, collaboration, dependency on others, emotional stress). Perceived difficulty and discomfort when using a facemask, compliance and correlations of compliance with DeMask-20 scores, demographics, spectacle and/or contact lens use, and visual acuity were evaluated. RESULTS: The number of factors was determined through factor analysis. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.716 for the ""Role limitation"" subscale to 0.938 for ""Ocular discomfort"" subscale. 1,214 participants (402 men, 812 women, mean age 36.79±12.50 years) completed the DeMask-20 instrument. Mean DeMask-20 score of all study participants was 3.79±0.71. Significant differences in DeMask-20 score were detected in gender (p = 0.009), spectacle use (p = 0.034), contact lens use (p = 0.049), and binocular distance visual acuity (bDVA) (p = 0.001). Mean compliance of all participants was 4.05±0.96. Men, people <50 years and spectacle wearers showed significantly worse compliance (p<0.05). Moreover, professional workers and professional drivers demonstrated significantly better compliance (p = 0.008 and p = 0.047). Significant correlation was detected between compliance and DeMask-20 score (p<0.001, R2 = 0.471). Significant correlations were detected with driving, near vision, distance vision, collaboration, role limitation, emotional stress (p<0.05, R2: 0.386-0.493). CONCLUSIONS: Factor analysis suggested that the DeMask-20 instrument demonstrates adequate validity, while Cronbach's alpha indicated sufficient internal consistency of all subscales. This study provided the necessary methods that could evaluate compliance trends and the efficacy of healthcare interventions against COVID-19. Our outcomes suggest that young males who use spectacles should be targeted by Greek Healthcare authorities in order to improve compliance rates.","Labiris, Georgios; Panagiotopoulou, Eirini-Kanella; Perente, Asli; Chatzimichael, Eleftherios; Fotiadis, Ioannis; Taliantzis, Sergios; Konstantinidis, Aristeidis; Dardabounis, Doukas",PLoS One,221,20

This impacts patients with dysphagia complications caused by head and neck cancers. As this pandemic of COVID-19 may last longer than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, a practical workflow for managing dysphagia is crucial to ensure a safe and efficient practice to patients and health care personnel. This document provides clinical practice guidelines based on available evidence to date to balance the risks of SARS-CoV-2 exposure with the risks associated with dysphagia. Critical considerations include reserving instrumental assessments for urgent cases only, optimizing the noninstrumental swallowing evaluation, appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and use of telehealth when appropriate. Despite significant limitations in clinical service provision during the pandemic of COVID-19, a safe and reasonable dysphagia care pathway can still be implemented with modifications of setup and application of newer technologies.","Ku, Peter K M; Holsinger, Floyd Christopher; Chan, Jason Y K; Yeung, Zenon W C; Chan, Becky Y T; Tong, Michael C F; Starmer, Heather M",Head Neck,221,16

SARS-CoV-2 al 7 de junio, el Perú enfrenta una sobredemanda de los pacientes con COVID-19 que requieren atención en servicios de salud (Ministerio de Salud 2020) Este escenario se ve reflejado en los 9583 pacientes hospitalizados, de los cuales 1062 se encuentran en una unidad de cuidados intensivos con ventilación mecánica (Ministerio de Salud 2020) Así se deben implementar una serie de procesos de desinfección en los ambientes de los servicios de salud destinados a reducir el riesgo de contagio entre pacientes y al personal de salud considerando que la vía principal de transmisión del SARS-CoV-2 en ambientes interiores es por vía aérea a partir de los portadores del virus (Setti et al 2020) Como parte de las estrategias del sistema de salud para enfrentar al COVID-19 se expandió la oferta de camas hospitalarias y de unidades de cuidados intensivos;asimismo, se implementaron diversos ambientes para acoger a los pacientes con COVID-19 (Presidencia del Consejo de Ministros 2020) Los pacientes con COVID-19 pueden generar gotas y aerosoles al estornudar, toser y hablar que pueden diseminar al SARS-CoV-2 (World Health Organization 2020b), por lo tanto, la atención en entornos hospitalarios requiere un alto nivel de asepsia Sin embargo, la escasez de recursos y de personal de salud durante la pandemia, se ha convertido en una limitante, por lo que es necesario evaluar cuáles son las medidas más efectivas y qué otras medidas de desinfección pueden ser empleadas para este fin El 30 de marzo de 2020, el Instituto de Evaluación de Tecnologías en Salud e Investigación publicó el Reporte Breve N° 15, en el cual se evaluó el uso de luz ultravioleta como sustituto a la presión negativa en unidades de cuidados intensivos, concluyendo hasta ese momento que, no se podía establecer si la luz ultravioleta inactiva al SARS-CoV-2 y que estudios previos en otros coronavirus han mostrados resultados positivos con la luz ultravioleta tipo C (Instituto de Evaluación de Tecnologías en Salud e Investigación 2020) No obstante, es necesario evaluar si existe evidencia más actualizada y si es posible emplear la luz ultravioleta en otros ambientes hospitalarios En tal sentido, el objetivo del presente reporte breve es identificar la mejor evidencia disponible acerca de la eficacia de la luz ultravioleta para ser usada como un procedimiento desinfección contra el SARS-CoV-2 en ambientes hospitalarios y sus recomendaciones de uso MÉTODOS: Se llevó a cabo una búsqueda sistemática de la literatura el día 7 de junio de 2020 con respecto al uso de la luz ultravioleta para la desinfección de ambientes o superficies hospitalarias en el contexto de SARS-CoV-2 Para ello se emplearon las bases de datos bibliográficas: PubMed, Medline vía OVID y Embase Asimismo, se realizó una búsqueda manual avanzada en Google, y en páginas web de las principales sociedades o instituciones especializadas, tales como la World Health Organization (WHO) ((https://www who int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) y Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (https://www cdc gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index html) Se consideró la revisión de las listas de referencias de los estudios selecionado RESULTADOS: No se encontraron guías de práctica clínica, evaluaciones de tecnologías sanitarias, revisiones sistemáticas o estudios primarios en las bases de datos bibliográficas que evalúen la eficacia de la luz ultravioleta para ser usada como un procedimiento de desinfección contra el SARS-CoV-2 en ambientes hospitalarios A la fecha se han publicado una serie de experiencias acerca de medidas implementadas ante el COVID-19 y una guía de la Organización Mundial de la Salud donde se describen algunas medidas que deben implementarse en áreas de evaluación y tratamiento de pacientes COVID-19 en servicios de salud La información contenida en estos documentos sobre luz ultravioleta es muy puntual y no brinda mayores detalles técnicos acerca de las característic s de los equipos y condiciones de operatividad de los equipos CONCLUSIÓN: No se han encontrado estudios que determinen la eficacia de la luz ultravioleta para la desinfección de ambientes o superficie hospitalarios No obstante, tal como fue descrito en el Reporte Breve N° 15 del Instituto de Evaluación de Tecnologías en Salud e Investigación, existen estudios in vitro que muestran que la luz ultravioleta tiene la capacidad de inhibir el crecimiento en los coronavirus MERS y SARS, los cuales tienen un componente genético es similar al SARS-CoV-2 El uso de la luz ultravioleta en entornos hospitalarios ha sido descrito en publicaciones de experiencias realizadas en China, que reportan su uso como un procedimiento de desinfección de ambientes hospitalarios que se realiza durante 20 a 60 minutos sin tener mayores detalles sobre el tipo de luz ultravioleta empleada, fuentes de luz empleadas y área de cobertura de la fuente de luz ultravioleta según tipo de área hospitalaria Es importante mencionar que la irradiación de luz ultravioleta para la desinfección de ambientes o superficies hospitalarias requiere que las salas estén sin pacientes o personal de salud por el daño potencial que puede ocasionar la sobreexposición en piel y ojos (Yan et al 2020, Barnard, Eadie, and Wood 2020, Talbot et al 2002) Por lo tanto, con la evidencia disponible a la fecha (7 de junio de 2020), no es posible establecer si la luz ultravioleta es eficaz para inactivar al virus SARS-CoV-2;sin embargo, experiencias previas y una guía de la Organización Mundial de la Salud incluyen a la luz ultravioleta de tipo C como una media de desinfección luego de un procedimiento de limpieza manual en ambientes destinados a la atención de pacientes con COVID-19 Futuras

We find that S-specific antibodies capable of engaging FcÎ³ receptors decay over time, with S-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) activity within plasma declining accordingly. Although there is significant decay in ADCC and ADP activity, they remain readily detectable in almost all subjects at the last timepoint studied (94%) in contrast with neutralisation activity (70%).

Drawing on the job demand-control model, we proposed that a high-control job strategy (such as job crafting) alleviates the deleterious effect of customer incivility on job performance through emotional exhaustion, whereas a low-control job strategy (such as service scripts) aggravates this effect. To test the proposed moderated mediation effects, we collected three-wave data from 272 hotel employees and their 54 team leaders over a 6-month period. As predicted, job crafting and service scripts performed contrasting moderating functions. Specifically, the customer incivility-emotional exhaustion relationship was weaker for employees who engaged in job crafting more often than for those who did not. Job crafting also mitigated the negative indirect effect of customer incivility on job performance through emotional exhaustion. In contrast, the customer incivility-emotional exhaustion relationship was more pronounced among employees who used service scripts more often. Service scripts further exacerbate the negative indirect effect of customer incivility on job performance through emotional exhaustion.

Collective aeromedical evacuations (MEDEVACS) might help rebalance the demand and supply of health care. If interhospital transport of patients suffering from ARDS is relatively common, little is known about the specific challenges of collective medevac. Oxygen management in such context is crucial. We describe our experience with a focus on this resource. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the first six collective medevac performed during the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic by the French Military Health Service from March 17 to April 3, 2020. Oxygen management was compliant with international guidelines as well as aeronautical constraints and monitored throughout the flights. Presumed high O2 consumers were scheduled to board the last and disembark the first. RESULTS: Thirty-six mechanically ventilated patients were successfully transported within Europe. The duration of onboard ventilation was 185 minutes (145-198.5 minutes), including the flight, the boarding and disembarking periods. Oxygen intake was 1,650 L per patient per flight (1,350-1,950 L patient per flight) and 564 L per patient per hour (482-675 L per patient-1 per hour) and surpassed our anticipation. As anticipated, presumed high O2 consumers had a reduced ventilation duration onboard. The estimations of oxygen consumptions were frequently overshot, and only two hypoxemia episodes occurred. CONCLUSION: Oxygen consumption was higher than expected, despite anticipation and predefined oxygen management measures, and encourages to a great caution in the processing of such collective medevac missions.","Beaussac, Madeleine; Boutonnet, Mathieu; Koch, Lionel; Paris, Raphael; Di Filippo, Julia; Distinguin, Berangère; Murris, Sophie; Dupre, Henri-Louis; Muller, Violaine; Turc, Jean",Mil. med,221,24

Nevertheless, the study of single live bacteria in their aqueous environment has long remained a big challenge, due to the strong infrared absorption of water and the small size of bacteria compared to the micron-range infrared wavelengths of the probing photons. To record infrared spectra of bacteria in an aqueous environment, at different spatial resolutions, two setups were developed. A custom-built attenuated total reflection inverted microscope was coupled to a synchrotron-based FTIR spectrometer, using a germanium hemisphere. With such a setup, a projected spot size of 1 × 1 µm2 was achieved, which allowed spectral acquisition at the single-cell level in the 1800-1300 cm-1 region. The second setup used a demountable liquid micro-chamber with a thermal source-powered FTIR microscope, in transmission geometry, for probing clusters of a few thousands of live cells in the mid-IR region (4000-975 cm-1). Both setups were applied for studying two strains of a model lactic acid bacterium exhibiting different cryo-resistances. The two approaches allowed the discrimination of both strains and revealed population heterogeneity among bacteria at different spatial resolutions. The multivariate analysis of spectra indicated that the cryo-sensitive cells presented the highest cell heterogeneity and the highest content of proteins with the &#945;-helix structure.

Orthogeriatric teams input is invaluable in coordinating secondary fragility fracture prevention. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the rapid restructuring of healthcare teams and led to the redeployment of the orthogeriatricians to assist with the influx of medically unwell patients. This study explored the impact COVID-19 had on secondary fragility fracture prevention. Method A retrospective audit looking at the prescription of vitamin D/calcium supplements, bone-sparing medications, and DEXA scan requests in consecutive neck of femur fracture patients admitted to a trauma and orthopaedic unit pre- and post- UK lockdown in response to the pandemic. A re-audit was conducted following the implementation of our new mnemonic, “MRS BAD BONES”: Medication Review Rheumatology/Renal Advice Smoking Cessation Blood tests Alcohol limits DEXA scan Bone-sparing medications Orthogeriatric review Nutrition Exercise Supplements. Results Data for 50 patients was available in each phase. The orthogeriatric team reviewed 88% of patients pre-lockdown falling to 0% due to redeployment, before recovering to 38% in the post-intervention period. Upon lockdown there was a significant drop in the prescription of vitamin D/calcium supplements from 81.6% to 58.0% (p = 0.0156);of bone-sparing medications from 60.7% to 18.2% (p = 0.0037), and DEXA scan requests from 40.1% to 3.6% (p = 0.0027). Following the implementation of our mnemonic, there was a significant increase in the prescription of vitamin D/calcium supplements to 85.7% (p = 0.0034), bone-sparing medications to 72.4% (p = 0.0002) and DEXA scan requests to 60% (p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion COVID-19 had a major impact on the secondary prevention of fragility fractures in this population. The “MRS BAD BONES” mnemonic significantly improved the management and could be considered for use in a wider setting.","Stephens, A.; Rudd, H.; Stephens, E.; Ward, J.",Age and Ageing,221,33

METHODS: This analysis utilizes information on the availability of oxygen sources and delivery apparatuses to determine if a health facility is ready to deliver oxygen therapy to patients in need, and estimates how many patients can be treated with continuous oxygen flow for a 7-day period based on the available oxygen equipment at health facilities. Using GIS mapping software, the study team modeled varying travel times to oxygen-ready facilities to estimate the proportion of the population with access to care. RESULTS: 0.4% of all health facilities in Mozambique are prepared to deliver oxygen therapy to patients, for a cumulative total of 283.9 to 406.0 patients-weeks given the existing national capacity, under varying assumptions including ability to divert oxygen from a single source to multiple patients. 35% of the population in Mozambique has adequate access within one-hour driving time of an oxygen-ready health facility. This varies widely by region; 89.1% of the population of Maputo City was captured by the one-hour driving time network, as compared ot 4.4% of the population of Niassa province. CONCLUSIONS: The Mozambican health system faces the dual challenges of under-resourced health facilities and low geographic accessibility to healthcare as it prepares to confront the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis also illustrates the disparity between provinces in preparedness to deliver oxygen therapy to patient, with Cabo Delgado and Nampula being particularly under-resourced.","Denhard, Langan; Kaviany, Parisa; Chicumbe, Sérgio; Muianga, Cláudio; Laisse, Guitunga; Aune, Kyle; Sheffel, Ashley",Int J Equity Health,221,24

Although the well-known poly(ADP-ribosylating) (PARylating) PARPs primarily function in the DNA damage response, many noncanonical mono(ADP-ribosylating) (MARylating) PARPs are associated with cellular antiviral responses. We recently demonstrated robust up-regulation of several PARPs following infection with murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a model coronavirus. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection strikingly up-regulates MARylating PARPs and induces the expression of genes encoding enzymes for salvage NAD synthesis from nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinamide riboside (NR), while down-regulating other NAD biosynthetic pathways. We show that overexpression of PARP10 is sufficient to depress cellular NAD and that the activities of the transcriptionally induced enzymes PARP7, PARP10, PARP12 and PARP14 are limited by cellular NAD and can be enhanced by pharmacological activation of NAD synthesis. We further demonstrate that infection with MHV induces a severe attack on host cell NAD+ and NADP+ Finally, we show that NAMPT activation, NAM, and NR dramatically decrease the replication of an MHV that is sensitive to PARP activity. These data suggest that the antiviral activities of noncanonical PARP isozyme activities are limited by the availability of NAD and that nutritional and pharmacological interventions to enhance NAD levels may boost innate immunity to coronaviruses.","Heer, Collin D; Sanderson, Daniel J; Voth, Lynden S; Alhammad, Yousef M O; Schmidt, Mark S; Trammell, Samuel A J; Perlman, Stanley; Cohen, Michael S; Fehr, Anthony R; Brenner, Charles",J Biol Chem,221,16

Primary donor-derived infection can be associated with severe and rapidly fatal non-neoplastic disease, and diagnosis is made with high HHV-8 DNAemia. METHODS: We carried out an international survey to investigate the current approach to HHV-8 screening and management in SOT since a protocol has not been established by international guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 51 transplant centers from 15 countries filled out the survey. HHV-8-associated diseases in SOT have been diagnosed during the previous 5 years in 67% of centers. Pre-transplant serological screening is performed in 17 centers (33%) and post-transplant HHV-8 nucleic acid testing (NAT) monitoring is performed in 21 centers (41%). Performing HHV-8 NAT monitoring and serological screening were found associated with having diagnosed in the previous 5 years a non-malignant HHV-8-associated disease. CONCLUSIONS: Serological pre-transplant screening of donors and recipients and post-transplant HHV-8 NAT monitoring recommendations should be standardized. Even though serological assays are not optimal, they could contribute to increasing knowledge on epidemiology and management of HHV-8 associated diseases after SOT.

We investigated the clinical and laboratory features of recovered COVID-19 patients without pre-existing hematologic diseases at Wuhan No. 1 Hospital. Fifty-nine male and 68 female Chinese patients were included with the median age at 64 years in the present study. Eosinopenia (37.80%), monocytosis (51.97%), lymphocytopenia (25.20%), and anemia (51.97%) were the most common hematologic findings in our cohort, particularly in severe or critically ill COVID-19. The levels of changes in leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, platelets, hemoglobin levels, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) are overall associated with lung involvement, oxygen demand, and disease activity. However, changes of eosinophils (end hospitalization-baseline) (coefficients = 10.32; 95% CI = 1.03-19.60, P = 0.03) and basophils (Max - Min) (coefficients = 71.43; 95% CI = 8.55-134.31, P = 0.03) were independent predictors of delayed recovery in the hospital by the multivariate analysis in this recovered population. A variety of hematologic changes are associated with the severity and clinical outcome of recovered COVID-19 patients, which warrants further exploration of their underlying mechanisms.","Mao, Jian; Dai, Rong; Du, Rui-Chan; Zhu, Yan; Shui, Li-Ping; Luo, Xiao-Hua",Ann Hematol,221,16

While many have focused on clinical outcomes, less attention has been paid to vulnerability and risk of infection. In this study, we developed a planning tool that examines factors that affect vulnerability to COVID-19. METHODS: Across 46 variables, we defined five broad categories: 1) access to medical services, 2) underlying health conditions, 3) environmental exposures, 4) vulnerability to natural disasters, and 5) sociodemographic, behavioral, and lifestyle factors. The developed tool was validated by comparing the estimated overall vulnerability with the real-time reported normalized confirmed cases of COVID-19. ANALYSIS: A principal component analysis was undertaken to reduce the dimensions. In order to identify vulnerable census tracts, we conducted rank-based exceedance and K-means cluster analyses. RESULTS: All of the 5 vulnerability categories, as well as the overall vulnerability, showed significant (P-values <<0.05) and relatively strong correlations (0.203<&#961;<0.57) with the normalized confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the census tract level. Our study showed a total of 722,357 (~17% of the County population) people, including 171,403 between the ages of 45-65 (~4% of County's population), and 76,719 seniors (~2% of County population), are at a higher risk based on the aforementioned categories. The exceedance and K-means cluster analysis demonstrated that census tracts in the northeastern, eastern, southeastern and northwestern regions of the County are at highest risk. CONCLUSION: Policymakers can use this planning tool to identify neighborhoods at high risk for becoming hot spots; efficiently match community resources with needs, and ensure that the most vulnerable have access to equipment, personnel, and medical interventions.","Kiaghadi, Amin; Rifai, Hanadi S; Liaw, Winston",PLoS One,221,24

The specific point of interest in this research is on predictive, preventive and personalized interoperable digital healthcare solutions. This point is supported by failures from the past, where the separate design of digital health solutions has led to lack of interoperability. Hence, this review paper investigates the integration of predictive, preventive and personalized interoperable digital healthcare systems. The second point of interest is the use of new mass surveillance technologies to feed personal data from health professionals to governments, without any comprehensive studies that determine if such new technologies and data policies would address the pandemic crisis. Method: This is a review paper. Two approaches were used: A comprehensive bibliographic review with R statistical methods of the COVID-19 pandemic in PubMed literature and Web of Science Core Collection, supported with Google Scholar search. In addition, a case study review of emerging new approaches in different regions, using medical literature, academic literature, news articles and other reliable data sources. Results: Most countries’ digital responses involve big data analytics, integration of national health insurance databases, tracing travel history from individual’s location databases, code scanning and individual’s online reporting. Public responses of mistrust about privacy data misuse differ across countries, depending on the chosen public communication strategy. We propose predictive, preventive and personalized solutions for pandemic management, based on social machines and connected devices. Solutions: The proposed predictive, preventive and personalized solutions are based on the integration of IoT data, wearable device data, mobile apps data and individual data inputs from registered users, operating as a social machine with strong security and privacy protocols. We present solutions that would enable much greater speed in future responses. These solutions are enabled by the social aspect of human-computer interactions (social machines) and the increased connectivity of humans and devices (Internet of Things). Conclusion: Inadequate data for risk assessment on speed and urgency of COVID-19, combined with increased globalization of human society, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19. Despite an abundance of digital methods that could be used in slowing or stopping COVID-19 and future pandemics, the world remains unprepared, and lessons have not been learned from previous cases of pandemics. We present a summary of predictive, preventive and personalized digital methods that could be deployed fast to help with the COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Radanliev, Petar; De Roure, David; Walton, Rob; Van Kleek, Max; Montalvo, Rafael Mantilla; Santos, Omar; Maddox, La’Treall; Cannady, Stacy",EPMA J.,221,23

This prospective cohort study included 303 patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Participants were first classified according to the presence of obesity; then, they were classified according to the presence of MS. Clinical, radiologic, and analytical parameters were collected. We reported that patients with obesity presented moderate COVID-19 symptoms and pneumonia, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and needed tocilizumab more frequently. Meanwhile, patients with MS presented severe pneumonia and respiratory failure more frequently, they have a higher mortality rate, and they also showed higher creatinine and troponin levels. The main findings of this study are that IL-6 is a potential predictor of COVID-19 severity in patients with obesity, while troponin and LDH can be used as predictive biomarkers of COVID-19 severity in MS patients.

As COVID-19 progressed and the first wave diminished (relatively speaking depending on the jurisdiction), more opportunities presented for making explicit choices between COVID and non-COVID patients. Then, as the second wave surged, again decision makers were more constrained even as more information and greater understanding developed. Moving out of the pandemic to recovery, choice making becomes paramount as there are no set rules to lean back into historical patterns of resource allocation.

Serological tests can be an important complementary approach. We aimed to assess the practical performance of RT-PCR-based surveillance protocols and determine the extent of undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection in Shenzhen, China. Methods: We did a cohort study in Shenzhen, China and attempted to recruit by telephone all RT-PCR-negative close contacts (defined as those who lived in the same residence as, or shared a meal, travelled, or socially interacted with, an index case within 2 days before symptom onset) of all RT-PCR-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 detected since January, 2020, via contact tracing. We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples from RT-PCR-negative close contacts 2-15 weeks after initial virological testing by RT-PCR, using total antibody, IgG, and IgM ELISAs. In addition, we did a serosurvey of volunteers from neighbourhoods with no reported cases, and from neighbourhoods with reported cases. We assessed rates of infection undetected by RT-PCR, performance of RT-PCR over the course of infection, and characteristics of individuals who were seropositive on total antibody ELISA but RT-PCR negative. Findings: Between April 12 and May 4, 2020, we enrolled and collected serological samples from 2345 (53·0%) of 4422 RT-PCR-negative close contacts of cases of RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. 1175 (50·1%) of 2345 were close contacts of cases diagnosed in Shenzhen with contact tracing details, and of these, 880 (74·9%) had serum samples collected more than 2 weeks after exposure to an index case and were included in our analysis. 40 (4·5%) of 880 RT-PCR-negative close contacts were positive on total antibody ELISA. The seropositivity rate with total antibody ELISA among RT-PCR-negative close contacts, adjusted for assay performance, was 4·1% (95% CI 2·9-5·7), which was significantly higher than among individuals residing in neighbourhoods with no reported cases (0·0% [95% CI 0·0-1·1]). RT-PCR-positive individuals were 8·0 times (95% CI 5·3-12·7) more likely to report symptoms than those who were RT-PCR-negative but seropositive, but both groups had a similar distribution of sex, age, contact frequency, and mode of contact. RT-PCR did not detect 48 (36% [95% CI 28-44]) of 134 infected close contacts, and false-negative rates appeared to be associated with stage of infection. Interpretation: Even rigorous RT-PCR testing protocols might miss a substantial proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections, perhaps in part due to difficulties in determining the timing of testing in asymptomatic individuals for optimal sensitivity. RT-PCR-based surveillance and control protocols that include rapid contact tracing, universal RT-PCR testing, and mandatory 2-week quarantine were, nevertheless, able to contain community spread in Shenzhen, China.

We performed a systematic review to determine the demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological factors associated with severity and mortality in COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and WHO database for English language articles from inception until May 8, 2020. We included Observational studies with direct comparison of clinical characteristics between a) patients who died and those who survived or b) patients with severe disease and those without severe disease. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two authors independently. RESULTS: Among 15680 articles from the literature search, 109 articles were included in the analysis. The risk of mortality was higher in patients with increasing age, male gender (RR 1.45, 95%CI 1.23-1.71), dyspnea (RR 2.55, 95%CI 1.88-2.46), diabetes (RR 1.59, 95%CI 1.41-1.78), hypertension (RR 1.90, 95%CI 1.69-2.15). Congestive heart failure (OR 4.76, 95%CI 1.34-16.97), hilar lymphadenopathy (OR 8.34, 95%CI 2.57-27.08), bilateral lung involvement (OR 4.86, 95%CI 3.19-7.39) and reticular pattern (OR 5.54, 95%CI 1.24-24.67) were associated with severe disease.

CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the factors associated of disease severity and mortality identified in our study may assist in clinical decision-making and critical-care resource allocation for patients with COVID-19.","Chidambaram, Vignesh; Tun, Nyan Lynn; Haque, Waqas Z; Majella, Marie Gilbert; Sivakumar, Ranjith Kumar; Kumar, Amudha; Hsu, Angela Ting-Wei; Ishak, Izza A; Nur, Aqsha A; Ayeh, Samuel K; Salia, Emmanuella L; Zil-E-Ali, Ahsan; Saeed, Muhammad A; Sarena, Ayu P B; Seth, Bhavna; Ahmadzada, Muzzammil; Haque, Eman F; Neupane, Pranita; Wang, Kuang-Heng; Pu, Tzu-Miao; Ali, Syed M H; Arshad, Muhammad A; Wang, Lin; Baksh, Sheriza; Karakousis, Petros C; Galiatsatos, Panagis",PLoS One,221,16

361316,361316,361316,Modelling the fate and transport of colloidal particles in association with BPA in river water,13.769345,3.597977,2020,"As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading worldwide, there have been arguments regarding the aerosol transmission of its causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Moreover, some re-detectable positive (RP) patients have been reported. However, little attention has been given to the follow-up of recovered patients, and there is no environmental evidence to determine whether these patients continue to shed the virus after they test negative. Therefore, with an objective to test the hypothesis of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to 1) determine whether SARS-CoV-2 particles are present in the indoor air and 2) determine whether recovered patients are still shedding virus, thus providing much-needed environmental evidence for the management of COVID-19 patients during the recovery period. In this study, surface and air samples were collected from an intensive care unit (ICU) containing one ready-for-discharge patient. All surface samples tested negative, but the air samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This implies that SARS-CoV-2 particles may be shed in aerosol form for days after patients test negative. This finding may be one of the reasons for the observation of RP patients; therefore, there is a need for improved clinical and disease management guidelines for recovered COVID-19 patients.","Jin, Tingxu; Li, Jun; Yang, Jun; Li, Jiawei; Hong, Feng; Long, Hai; Deng, Qihong; Qin, Yong; Jiang, Jiajun; Zhou, Xuan; Song, Qian; Pan, Chunliu; Luo, Peng",Sustain Cities Soc,221,24

Additionally, 75% of the 20 funerals did not adhere to the 2-m SD requirement of which 80% were in rural areas. Higher SG and SD compliance in urban funerals could be partially explained by the presence of a recognized authority who enforced crowd size limits, and the heterogeneous urban community who were more likely to flag breaches than their collectivistic, homogeneous, close-knit, rural counterparts. Ultimately, health authorities need to utilize a social lens that incorporates etic and emic differences in culture to ensure maximum compliance.","Vave, Ron",Asia Pac J Public Health,221,26

There is evidence that lifestyle interventions, for example, exercise, dietary advice and smoking cessation programmes for service users with severe mental illness can be of health benefit. This review was carried out to identify the literature pertaining to physical health interventions for service users who have experienced a first-episode psychosis (FEP), to examine the nature of the interventions which were carried out and to assess these interventions in terms of feasibility and efficacy. METHODS: A narrative review was conducted in August 2019 by searching 'Pubmed' and 'Embase' electronic databases. Studies investigating the effect a physical health intervention had on service users who had experienced a FEP were included in the review. RESULTS: Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria: 12 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative. Exercise, dietary advice, smoking cessation and motivational coaching were some of the physical health interventions utilised in the identified studies. Positive effects were seen in terms of physical health markers wherever they were investigated, particularly when the intervention was delivered early. The impact on psychiatric symptoms and longer-term impacts on health were less frequently assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Physical health interventions have a positive impact on service users who have experienced a FEP. More research is warranted in this area in Ireland. These studies should include controls, have longer follow-up periods and should assess the impact on psychiatric health.","Fouhy, Fergal; Cullen, Walter; O039,; Connor, Karen",Ir J Psychol Med,221,21

Therefore, finding a vaccine for this virus became a priority for the scientific community. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been described as the keystone for viral entry into cells and effective immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 is elicited by this protein. Consequently, many commercialized vaccines focus on the spike protein and require the use of an optimal adjuvant during vaccination. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has demonstrated a powerful enhancement of acquired immunity against many pathogens when delivered in a sustained and local manner. In this context, we developed an encapsulated cell-based technology consisting of a biocompatible, semipermeable capsule for secretion of GM-CSF. In this study, we investigated whether murine GM-CSF (muGM-CSF) represents a suitable adjuvant for SARS-CoV-2 immunization, and which delivery strategy for muGM-CSF could be most beneficial. To test this, different groups of mice were immunized with intra-dermal (i.d.) electroporated spike DNA in the absence or presence of recombinant or secreted muGM-CSF. Results demonstrated that adjuvanting a spike DNA vaccine with secreted muGM-CSF resulted in enhancement of specific cellular and humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR, admitted to ICU between March and April 2020 were enrolled. At ICU admission, BALF were analyzed by flow cytometry. Univariate, multivariate and Spearman correlation analyses were performed. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were enrolled, median age of 64 years (IQR 58-69). The majority cells in the BALF were neutrophils (70%, IQR 37.5-90.5) and macrophages (27%, IQR 7-49) while a minority were lymphocytes, 1%, TCD3+ 92% (IQR 82-95). The ICU mortality was 32.8%.

The purpose of this article is to review the experiences of an integrated urban health system, exploring the strategic tactics to ensure effective communication between team members, patient and family engagement in discharge planning, establishing and maintaining trust, connecting patients to appropriate next level of care services, and providing transitional care management support. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTINGS: The Covid-19 pandemic response stimulated the rapid transformation of the acute care management model amidst the tremendous challenge of meeting the discharge planning needs of the hospitalized population in one large, urban, integrated health care system. FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: Patients transitioning to the community setting following discharge are vulnerable and at risk for adverse sequelae, and transitional care management that does not end when the patient leaves the hospital setting is integral to promoting positive patient outcomes (Naylor, Aiken, Kurtzman, Olds, & Hirschman, 2011). The care management approach during the pandemic in one health care system precipitously shifted to an entirely virtual, remote model, and the team continued to provide transitional care support for hospitalized patients to avoid the common pitfalls that are associated with unfavorable outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: The insights gleaned from one health system's experiences during the pandemic are transferable to other facets of care management in routine circumstances, with emphasis on the avoidance of the common care management snares that lead to less than optimal patient outcomes. The development and implementation of multifaceted interventions, with the goals of supporting health-promoting behavior changes and self-care capacity for at risk populations, are relevant in the current health care environment.","Chovanec, Kelli; Howard, Nicole R",Prof Case Manag,221,20

Thanks to the large number of published data, we are beginning to understand the logic of the human response to a virus adapted to bat immunity. RECENT FINDINGS: Impairment of types I and III interferon responses may facilitate the occurrence of severe COVID-19 with reduced antiviral activity associated to potent inflammation. The human T and B-cell germline repertoire contain the specificities able to react against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Although inflammation disrupts the structure of germinal centers, memory T and B cells can be found in the blood of patients after mild and severe COVID 19. SUMMARY: Further studies are indispensable to better understand the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2. The diversity of the individual reaction may contribute to explain the clinical manifestation spectrum. Immunological memory can be demonstrated in patients, convalescent from mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19, but we do not know whether asymptomatic individuals have memory of the virus.

METHODS: a systematic literature review assessing papers published in the most comprehensive databases in the field of health intended to answer the question, ""What are the effects of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, and what is the neonatal prognosis?"" RESULTS: 49 papers published in 2020 were eligible, presenting low levels of evidence.

There is, however, no evidence of vertical transmission based on what has been assessed so far, considering there are knowledge gaps concerning the care provided during and after delivery, as well as a lack of suitable biological samples for testing SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: We cannot rule out potential worsening of the clinical conditions of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2, whether the infection is associated with comorbidities or not, due to the occurrence of respiratory disorders, cardiac rhythm disturbances, and acid-base imbalance, among others.

Moreover, the psychological toll may be worsening for this health crisis due to the growing numbers of mass deaths and unemployment levels. Coronaphobia, a relatively new pandemic-related construct, has been shown to be strongly related to functional impairment and psychological distress. However, the extent to which coronaphobia is uniquely accountable for the psychological distress experienced during the COVID-19 crisis has not been systematically investigated. The current study examined this question of incremental validity using online data from 453 adult MTurk workers in the U.S. The results of a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that coronaphobia explained additional variance in depression, generalized anxiety, and death anxiety, above sociodemographics, COVID-19 factors, and the vulnerability factors of neuroticism, health anxiety, and reassurance-seeking behaviors. These findings suggest that health professionals should be aware of coronaphobia as this expression of pandemic-related stress has reliably demonstrated incremental validity in accounting for major indicators of psychological distress.","Lee, Sherman A; Jobe, Mary C; Mathis, Amanda A; Gibbons, Jeffrey A",J Anxiety Disord,221,16

As the number of children with COVID-19 gradually increases, the disease has been documented in premature babies, infants, children, and adolescents. Severe and fatal cases in children are relatively rare. The burden of disease in children has been relatively low, but the high proportions of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections in children deserve careful attention.

There are two main characteristics the models take into account, namely a network structure of interactions, which we treat by an appropriate mesoscopic description, and a different role of interacting agents. The latter differs from interactions treated in classical statistical mechanics in the sense that the agents do not have symmetric roles, but there is rather an active and a passive agent. We will demonstrate how a certain form of kinetic equations can be obtained to describe such interactions at a mesoscopic level and moreover obtain macroscopic models from monokinetics solutions of those. The derivation naturally leads to systems of nonlocal reaction-diffusion equations (or in a suitable limit local versions thereof), which can explain spatial phase separation phenomena found to emerge from the microscopic interactions. We will highlight the approach in three examples, namely the evolution and coarsening of dialects in human language, the construction of social norms, and the spread of an epidemic.","Burger, Martin",,221,1

The toll collection system (TCS) traffic volume for 2019-2020 and traffic inflow trends were analyzed using independent samples t-test and nonlinear regression, respectively. The association between TCS traffic volume and new COVID-19 cases by city was analyzed using correlation analysis. RESULTS: Traffic inflow volume in 2020 decreased 3.7% from 2019. The TCS traffic inflow trend in the 8 provinces decreased during the first COVID-19 wave, gradually increased until the second wave, decreased after the second wave, and showed a sharp decrease in the third wave. There was a positive correlation between the traffic inflow volume and new cases in Busan-Gyeongnam and Jeonbuk, but not in Daegu-Gyeongbuk or Gangwon. CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in new COVID-19 cases in the regions was associated with increased traffic inflow volume. Therefore, the Korean government can establish preventive social distancing policies by identifying increases or decreases in traffic volume.

Personal health-related issues such as mental health, self-harm and depression have been studied because users often share their stories on such platforms. Online users resort to sharing because the empathy and support from online communities are crucial in helping the affected individuals. A preliminary analysis shows how contents related to non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) proliferate on Twitter. Thus, we use Twitter to collect relevant data, analyse, and proffer ways of supporting users prone to NSSI behaviour. Our approach utilises a custom crawler to retrieve relevant tweets from self-reporting users and relevant organisations interested in combating self-harm. Through textual analysis, we identify six major categories of self-harming users consisting of inflicted, anti-self-harm, support seekers, recovered, pro-self-harm and at risk. The inflicted category dominates the collection. From an engagement perspective, we show how online users respond to the information posted by self-harm support organisations on Twitter. By noting the most engaged organisations, we apply a useful technique to uncover the organisations' strategy. The online participants show a strong inclination towards online posts associated with mental health related attributes. Our study is based on the premise that social media can be used as a tool to support proactive measures to ease the negative impact of self-harm. Consequently, we proffer ways to prevent potential users from engaging in self-harm and support affected users through a set of recommendations.

Its mortality and morbidity rate are rapidly increasing, with limited medications. The emergent outbreak of COVID-19 prompted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) keeps spreading. In this infection, a patient's immune response plays pivotal role in the pathogenesis. This inflammatory factor was shown by its mediators that, in severe cases, reach the cytokine at peaks. Hyperinflammatory state may sparks significant imbalances in transporters and drug metabolic machinery, and subsequent alteration of drug pharmacokinetics may result in unexpected therapeutic response. The present scenario has accounted for the requirement for therapeutic opportunities to relive and overcome this pandemic. Despite the diminishing developments of COVID-19, there is no drug still approved to have significant effects with no side effect on the treatment for COVID-19 patients. Based on the evidence, many antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs have been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat the COVID-19 patients even though not knowing the possible drug-drug interactions (DDI). Remdesivir, favipiravir, and molnupiravir are deemed the most hopeful antiviral agents by improving infected patient's health. Dexamethasone is the first known steroid medicine that saved the lives of seriously ill patients. Some oligopeptides and proteins have also been using. The current review summarizes medication updates to treat COVID-19 patients in an inflammatory state and their interaction with drug transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes.

Although the number of infected cases is increasing, information about its clinical characteristics in the Middle East, especially in Iran, a country which is considered to be one of the most important focal points of the disease in the world, is lacking. To date, there is no available literature on the clinical data on COVID-19 patients in Iran. METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective study, 113 hospitalized confirmed cases of COVID-19 admitted to university affiliated hospitals in Shiraz, Iran from February 20 to March 20 were entered in the study. RESULTS: The mean age was 53.75 years and 71 (62.8%) were males. The most common symptoms at onset were fatigue (75: 66.4%), cough (73: 64.6%), and fever (67: 59.3%). Laboratory data revealed significant correlation between lymphocyte count (P value = 0.003), partial thromboplastin time (P value = 0.000), international normalized ratio (P value = 0.000) with the severity of the disease. The most common abnormality in chest CT scans was ground-glass opacity (77: 93.9%), followed by consolidation (48: 58.5%). Our results revealed an overall 8% (9 out of 113 cases) mortality rate among patients, in which the majority was among patients admitted to the ICU (5: 55.6%). CONCLUSION: Evaluating the clinical data of COVID-19 patients and finding the source of infection and studying the behavior of the disease is crucial for understanding the pandemic.","Shahriarirad, Reza; Khodamoradi, Zohre; Erfani, Amirhossein; Hosseinpour, Hamidreza; Ranjbar, Keivan; Emami, Yasaman; Mirahmadizadeh, Alireza; Lotfi, Mehrzad; Shirazi Yeganeh, Babak; Dorrani Nejad, Abolfazl; Hemmati, Abdolrasool; Ebrahimi, Mostafa; Moghadami, Mohsen",BMC Infect Dis,221,20

There is considerable concern that widespread infection will result in a surge of critically ill patients that will overwhelm our present adult ICU capacity. In this setting, one proposal to add ""surge capacity"" has been the use of PICU beds and physicians to care for these critically ill adults. DESIGN: Narrative review/perspective. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENTS: Not applicable. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The virus's high infectivity and prolonged asymptomatic shedding have resulted in an exponential growth in the number of cases in the United States within the past weeks with many (up to 6%) developing acute respiratory distress syndrome mandating critical care services. Coronavirus disease 2019 critical illness appears to be primarily occurring in adults. Although pediatric intensivists are well versed in the care of acute respiratory distress syndrome from viral pneumonia, the care of differing aged adult populations presents some unique challenges. In this statement, a team of adult and pediatric-trained critical care physicians provides guidance on common ""adult"" issues that may be encountered in the care of these patients and how they can best be managed in a PICU. CONCLUSIONS: This concise scientific statement includes references to the most recent and relevant guidelines and clinical trials that shape management decisions. The intention is to assist PICUs and intensivists in rapidly preparing for care of adult coronavirus disease 2019 patients should the need arise.","Remy, Kenneth E; Verhoef, Philip A; Malone, Jay R; Ruppe, Michael D; Kaselitz, Timothy B; Lodeserto, Frank; Hirshberg, Eliotte L; Slonim, Anthony; Dezfulian, Cameron",Pediatr Crit Care Med,221,16

This study aimed to investigate the mental health status and associated factors among residents of Pakistan. An online questionnaire survey was conducted from April 3 to May 7, 2020, using convenience and snowball sampling techniques. Data regarding demographics, physical health status and contact history during the last 2 weeks were collected. Furthermore, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress scales (DASS-21) were utilized to measure the mental health of the participants. The analyses included descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Of the 1663 participants who completed this survey, 1598 met the inclusion criteria. The results revealed mild to moderate depression among 390 participants (24.4%), mild to moderate anxiety among 490 participants (30.7%) and mild to moderate stress among 52 participants (3.3%). A majority of the participants rated their health as good (n = 751, 47.0%). Moreover, students reported significantly higher scores on depression (B = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.71-1.88; p < 0.05), anxiety (B = 0.56, 95% CI = -0.06 to 1.18; p < 0.05) and stress (B = 0.56, 95% CI = -0.12 to 1.23; p < 0.05). Physical symptoms, including fever, cough and myalgia, and contact history in the last 14 days reported significant associations with depression, anxiety and stress (p < 0.05). The mental health status of the people was noted to be affected during the COVID-19 outbreak. Assessment of several factors with significant associations with depression, anxiety and stress may aid in developing psychological interventions for vulnerable groups.","Hayat, Khezar; Haq, Muhammad; Wang, Weihua; Khan, Faiz Ullah; Rehman, Anees Ur; Rasool, Muhammad; Kadirhaz, Muhtar; Omer, Sumaira; Rasheed, Usman; Fang, Yu",Psychol Health Med,221,3

Although the peak sensitivity of RT-PCR can be high, the probability of detecting an infection will vary throughout the course of an infection. The effectiveness of routine asymptomatic testing will therefore depend on testing frequency and how PCR detection varies over time. METHODS: We fitted a Bayesian statistical model to a dataset of twice weekly PCR tests of UK healthcare workers performed by self-administered nasopharyngeal swab, regardless of symptoms. We jointly estimated times of infection and the probability of a positive PCR test over time following infection; we then compared asymptomatic testing strategies by calculating the probability that a symptomatic infection is detected before symptom onset and the probability that an asymptomatic infection is detected within 7 days of infection. RESULTS: We estimated that the probability that the PCR test detected infection peaked at 77% (54-88%) 4 days after infection, decreasing to 50% (38-65%) by 10 days after infection. Our results suggest a substantially higher probability of detecting infections 1-3 days after infection than previously published estimates. We estimated that testing every other day would detect 57% (33-76%) of symptomatic cases prior to onset and 94% (75-99%) of asymptomatic cases within 7 days if test results were returned within a day. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that routine asymptomatic testing can enable detection of a high proportion of infected individuals early in their infection, provided that the testing is frequent and the time from testing to notification of results is sufficiently fast.","Hellewell, Joel; Russell, Timothy W; Beale, Rupert; Kelly, Gavin; Houlihan, Catherine; Nastouli, Eleni; Kucharski, Adam J",BMC Med,221,1

We have examined the binding modes of ebselen and its derivative in Mpro via high resolution co-crystallography and investigated their chemical reactivity via mass spectrometry. Stronger Mpro inhibition than ebselen and potent ability to rescue infected cells were observed for a number of derivatives. A free selenium atom bound with cysteine of catalytic dyad has been revealed in crystallographic structures of Mpro with ebselen and MR6-31-2 suggesting hydrolysis of the enzyme bound organoselenium covalent adduct and formation of a phenolic by-product, confirmed by mass spectrometry.

METHODS: Individual information on confirmed cases from January 21 to March 2 was collected from provincial or municipal health commissions. We identified the difference between imported and local cases in the epidemiological characteristics. Two models were established to estimate the factors associated with the time interval from symptom onset to hospitalization (TOH) and length of hospital stay (LOS), respectively. RESULTS: Among 7042 cases, 3392 (48.17%) were local cases, and 3304 (46.92%) were imported cases. Since the first intervention was adopted in Hubei on January 23, the daily reported imported cases reached a peak on January 28 and gradually decreased since then. Imported cases were on average younger (41 vs. 48) and had more males (58.66% vs. 47.53%) than local cases. Furthermore, imported cases had more contacts with other confirmed cases (2.80 ± 2.33 vs. 2.17 ± 2.10), which were mainly within family members (2.26 ± 2.18 vs. 1.57 ± 2.06). The TOH and LOS were 2.67 ± 3.69 and 18.96 ± 7.63 days, respectively, and a longer TOH was observed in elderly living in the provincial capital cities that had a higher migration intensity with Hubei. CONCLUSIONS: Measures to restrict traffic can effectively reduce imported spread. However, household transmission is still not controlled, particularly for the infection of imported cases to elderly women. It is still essential to surveil and educate patients about early admission or isolation.","Zhou, Feng; You, Chong; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Qian, Kaihuan; Hou, Yan; Gao, Yanhui; Zhou, Xiao-Hua",Int J Infect Dis,221,16

The present study investigates if unemployment increases the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization for men and women of working age in Germany. METHODS: The study uses the health insurance data from AOK Rhineland/Hamburg (from 1 January 2020 until 18 June 2020) of 1,288,745 persons aged between 18 and 65. Four employment situations are distinguished: (1) regular employment, (2) low-wage employment with social support, (3) unemployment with receipt of unemployment benefit 1, and (4) long-term unemployment with receipt of unemployment benefit 2. COVID-19 hospitalizations are measured on the basis of the ICD codes U07.1 and U07.2 reported by the hospitals. Multiple logistic regression models are calculated (adjusted for age and sex). RESULTS: During the observation period, 1521 persons had hospitalization with COVID-19 as primary or secondary diagnosis. Overall, this corresponds to a rate of 118 cases per 100,000 insured persons. Rates varied by employment situation. Compared with regularly employed persons, the odds ratio for a hospitalization was 1.94 (CI 95%: 1.74-2.15) for long-term unemployment, 1.29 (0.86-1.94) for unemployed, and 1.33 (0.98-1.82) for low-wage employment. CONCLUSION: The results are in line with earlier studies from the USA and Great Britain reporting socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 hospitalization risk. This provides the first empirical support that socioeconomic inequalities in the severity of COVID-19 also exists in Germany.","Wahrendorf, Morten; Rupprecht, Christoph J; Dortmann, Olga; Scheider, Maria; Dragano, Nico",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,221,29

However, there is limited work to determine the underlying cellular responses induced by exposure to SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. Thus, our objective was to investigate how human arterial adventitial fibroblasts inflammation, thrombosis and diabetic disease markers are altered in response to Spike, Nucleocapsid and Membrane-Envelope proteins. We hypothesized that after a short-term exposure to SARS-CoV-2 proteins, adventitial fibroblasts would have a higher expression of inflammatory, thrombotic and diabetic proteins, which would support a mechanism for altered vascular disease progression. After incubation, the expression of gC1qR, ICAM-1, tissue factor, RAGE and GLUT-4 was significantly up-regulated. In general, the extent of expression was different for each SARS-CoV-2 protein, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with cells through different mechanisms. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 protein interaction with vascular cells may regulate vascular disease responses.","Freda, Christopher Thor; Yin, Wei; Ghebrehiwet, Berhane; Rubenstein, David A",Clin Immunol,221,24

It is thought that measures introduced to stem the pandemic, such as the lockdown, contributed to this development. There are, however, conflicting data with respect to hospital referrals, delay times, and mortality. METHODS: Our systematic literature review and meta-analysis included studies reporting the number of hospital referrals of patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and/or non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) during lockdown episodes. We also collected data on delays caused by patient and system delay times, as well as on mortality. RESULTS: Data from 27 studies on a total of 81 163 patients were included in our meta-analysis. We found that the number of hospital admissions with myocardial infarction was significantly lower during the lockdown than before the pandemic (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.516, 95% CI: [0.403; 0.660], I2 = 98%). This was true both for patients with STEMI (IRR = 0.620, 95% CI: [0.514; 0.746], I2 = 96%) and for patients with NSTEMI (IRR = 0.454, 95% CI: [0.354; 0.584], I2 = 96%). We found no statistically significant difference, however, in the time from hospital admission to cardiac catheterization or on mortality, in relation to the time from the onset of symptoms to first contact with the health care system. CONCLUSION: In this study, we have shown that the lockdown due to COVID-19 was associated with a marked decline in the number of hospital admissions with myocardial infarction. As no significant effect on delay times or mortality was observed, it seems that appropriately rapid medical care continued to be delivered despite the lockdown.","Baumhardt, Michael; Dreyhaupt, Jens; Winsauer, Claudia; Stuhler, Lina; Thiessen, Kevin; Stephan, Tilman; Markovic, Sinisa; Rottbauer, Wolfgang; Imhof, Armin; Rattka, Manuel",Dtsch Arztebl Int,221,1
381566,381566,381566,On single point forecasts for fat-tailed variables,13.661232,3.5006514,2020,"BACKGROUND: On March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic. On that date, there were 134,576 reported cases and 4981 deaths worldwide. By March 26, 2020, just 2 weeks later, reported cases had increased four-fold to 531,865, and deaths increased five-fold to 24,073. Older people are both major users of telehealth services and are more likely to die as a result of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the extent that Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, during the 2 weeks following the pandemic announcement, sought to promote telehealth as a tool that could help identify COVID-19 among older people who may live alone, be frail, or be self-isolating, and give support to or facilitate the treatment of people who are or may be infected. METHODS: This paper reports, for the 2-week period previously mentioned and immediately prior, on activities and initiatives in the three countries taken by governments or their agencies (at national or state levels) together with publications or guidance issued by professional, trade, and charitable bodies. Different sources of information are drawn upon that point to the perceived likely benefits of telehealth in fighting the pandemic. It is not the purpose of this paper to draw together or analyze information that reflects growing knowledge about COVID-19, except where telehealth is seen as a component. RESULTS: The picture that emerges for the three countries, based on the sources identified, shows a number of differences. These differences center on the nature of their health services, the extent of attention given to older people (and the circumstances that can relate to them), the different geographies (notably concerned with rurality), and the changes to funding frameworks that could impact these. Common to all three countries is the value attributed to maintaining quality safeguards in the wider context of their health services but where such services are noted as sometimes having precluded significant telehealth use. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing changes and may help to establish telehealth more firmly in its aftermath. Some of the changes may not be long-lasting. However, the momentum is such that telehealth will almost certainly find a stronger place within health service frameworks for each of the three countries and is likely to have increased acceptance among both patients and health care providers.","Fisk, Malcolm; Livingstone, Anne; Pit, Sabrina Winona",J Med Internet Res,221,24

The need for specific treatments to adequately stop the inflammatory response and its sequelae is day by day more urgent and many therapeutic strategies were performed since COVID-19 burst in the last months. Statins were thought to be effective against this novel coronavirus for their anti-inflammatory properties, even if the real effects on COVID patients are still partially unexplored. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 501 adult patients, consecutively admitted to the two COVID-hospitals of Ferrara's territory, and divided them into two groups: ST = patients on statin therapy on admission and NST=patients not on statin therapy on admission. We searched for differences between groups in terms of anamnestic, clinical and laboratory data and then in terms of COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: We found significant differences between groups in terms of age, comorbidities, procalcitonin and CPK serum levels: ST patients were older, more comorbid, with lower procalcitonin and higher CPK serum levels. Male sex was, together with the Charlson Comorbidity Index, an independent predictor of needing intensification of care, while age only was a good predictor of in-hospital and 100-day mortality. Differences were also found in the survival functions between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: After a period of observation of 100 days, ST patients, despite their older age and their greater load of comorbidities, have similar survival functions to NST patients. If adjusted for age and CCI the survival functions of ST group are considerably more favourable than those of the second group.","Greco, Salvatore; D039,; Amuri, Andrea; Giorgini, Enrico; Luciani, Francesco; Lopreiato, Mariarosaria; Fortunato, Valeria; Scopa, Alessandro; Vestita, Grazia; Capatti, Eleonora; Passaro, Angelina",High blood pressure &amp; cardiovascular prevention (Online),221,30

Due to the enormous number of people who have been unaware until now, the development of COVID-19's second-wave infection has become a severe threat. The present investigation aimed to characterize the clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was carried out from all the other COVID-19 patients and confirmed by RT-PCR undergoing a specialized COVID-19 hospital. From March 1 to April 15, 2021, a total of 1326 samples were collected. Samples were only obtained from non-critical COVID-19 patients as critically ill patients required emergency intensive care medications. Then, from April 17 to May 03, 2021, SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical assessment was performed based on interim guidelines from the WHO. The diagnosis was conducted through RT-PCR. Later, identifying the symptomatic and asymptomatic patient based on checking the Clinical Observation Form (COF). The patients filled the COF form. Finally, statistical analyses were done using the SPSS 20 statistical program. RESULTS: In this investigation, a total of 326 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 positive. Among them, approximately 19.02% (n = 62) were asymptomatic, and 80.98% (n = 264) were symptomatic. Here, the finding shows that the occurrence of this infection was varied depending on age, sex, residence, occupation, smoking habit, comorbidities, etc. However, Males (60.12%) were more affected than females (39.88%), and, surprisingly, this pandemic infected both urban and rural residents almost equally (urban = 50.92%; rural = 49.08%). Approximately 19% of the asymptomatic and 62% of symptomatic cases had at least one comorbid disorder. Interestingly, an unexpected result was exhibited in the case of smokers, where non-smokers were more affected than smokers. The study indicates community transmission of COVID 19, where people were highly infected at their occupations (35.58%), at houses (23.93%) and by traveling (12.88%). Noteworthy, according to this report, a large number (19.33%) of individuals did not know exactly how they were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were most commonly treated by an antibiotic 95.09%, followed in second by corticosteroid 46.01%. Anti-viral drugs, remdesivir, and oxygenation are also needed for other patients. Among those, who were being treated, approximately 69.33% were isolated at home, 27.91% were being treated at dedicated COVID-19 hospitals. Finally, 96.63% were discharged without complications, and 0.03% has died. CONCLUSION: This investigation concludes that males became more infected than females. Interestingly, both urban and rural people became nearly equally infected. It noticed community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, where people were highly infected at their workplaces. A higher rate of silent transmission indicates that more caution is needed to identify asymptomatic patients. Most of the infected people were isolated at home whereas nearly one-fourth were treated at hospitals. Clinically, antibiotics were the most widely used treatment. However, the majority of the patients were discharged without complications. The current investigation would be helpful to understand the clinical manifestations and socio-demographic situations during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.","Ali, Md Roushan; Hasan, Md Amit; Rahman, Md Siddikur; Billah, Mutasim; Karmakar, Sumon; Shimu, Ajmeri Sultana; Hossain, Md Firose; Maruf, Md Mahmudul Hasan; Rahman, Md Sojiur; Saju, Md Saifur Rahman; Hasan, Mujtaba Rafid; Acharjee, Uzzal Kumar; Hasan, Md Faruk",J. infect. public health,221,16

The poor prognosis among patients affected with this type of cancer is associated with its high-invasiveness and the lack of successful therapies. A comprehensive understanding for the early molecular mechanisms in glioblastoma would definitely enhance the diagnosis and the treatment strategies. Deregulated expression of key genes that are known to be involved in early neurogenesis could be the instigator of brain tumorigenesis. Ras Like Without CAAX 1 (RIT1) gene that encodes an unusual ""orphan"" GTPase protein belongs to this category of critical genes that are known to be involved in controlling sequential proliferation and differentiation of adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells. In this study, we surveyed RIT1 gene expression by in-silico approaches to determine its spatio-temporal pattern in glioblastoma. Our results revealed a significant and progressive upregulation of RIT1 mRNA levels in various publicly available datasets. RIT1 expression ranked among the top upregulated genes in glioblastoma cohorts and it correlated with poor overall survival. Genetic and epigenetic analysis of RIT1 didn't reveal any significant aberration that could underlie its deregulated expression. Yet, our results highlighted the possibility of its activity to be transcriptionally controlled by STAT3, one of the main players in the onset of glioblastoma. In conclusion, our study presented for the first time a potential oncogenic role for RIT1 in glioblastoma. Knowing that the RAS superfamily of proteins has created an evolution in the cancer field, RIT1 should be added to this list through further investigations on its possible usage as a biomarker and therapeutic target in glioblastoma.","Khalil, Athar; Nemer, Georges",,221,21

They are highly attributed to its richness by alkaloids, terpenes, steroids and polyketons. This review aimed to comprehensively explore the diverse alkaloids isolated and identified from different species of genus Aspergillus that were found to be associated with different marine organisms regarding their chemistry and biology. Around 174 alkaloid metabolites were reported, 66 of which showed important biological activities with respect to the tested biological activities mainly comprising antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic, antioxidant and antifouling activities. Besides, in silico studies on different microbial proteins comprising DNA-gyrase, topoisomerase IV, dihydrofolate reductase, transcriptional regulator TcaR (protein), and aminoglycoside nucleotidyl transferase were done for sixteen alkaloids that showed anti-infective potential for better mechanistic interpretation of their probable mode of action. The inhibitory potential of compounds vs. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an important therapeutic target combating COVID-19 infection and its complication was also examined using molecular docking. Fumigatoside E showed the best fitting within the active sites of all the examined proteins. Thus, Aspergillus species isolated from marine organisms could afford bioactive entities combating infectious diseases.","Youssef, Fadia S; Alshammari, Elham; Ashour, Mohamed L",Int. j. mol. sci.

Existing work mainly focused on modeling the co-purchased relations between two items, but the compositional associations of item collections are largely unexplored. Actually, when a user chooses the complementary items for the purchased products, it is intuitive that she will consider the visual semantic coherence (such as color collocations, texture compatibilities) in addition to global impressions. Towards this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Content Attentive Neural Network (CANN) to model the comprehensive compositional coherence on both global contents and semantic contents. Specifically, we first propose a \textit{Global Coherence Learning} (GCL) module based on multi-heads attention to model the global compositional coherence. Then, we generate the semantic-focal representations from different semantic regions and design a \textit{Focal Coherence Learning} (FCL) module to learn the focal compositional coherence from different semantic-focal representations. Finally, we optimize the CANN in a novel compositional optimization strategy. Extensive experiments on the large-scale real-world data clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of CANN compared with several state-of-the-art methods.","Li, Zhi; Wu, Bo; Liu, Qi; Wu, Likang; Zhao, Hongke; Mei, Tao",,221,15

Covid-19 has fundamentally challenged the global health care system in all aspects. However, there is a growing concern for the subsequent detrimental effects of continuing delays or adjustments on time-dependent treatments for Covid-19 negative patients. Patients arriving to the ED with STEMIs and acute CVA are currently presumed to have delays due to Covid-19 related concerns. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic on non-Covid19 patients in emergency care settings. We conducted a retrospective study from February 2020 to April 2020 and compared this to a parallel period in 2019 to assess the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on three distinct non-Covid-19 ED diagnosis that require immediate intervention. Our primary outcome measures were time to primary PCI in acute STEMI, time to fibrinolysis in acute CVA, and time to femoral hip fracture correction surgery. Our secondary outcome measure included a composite outcome of length of stay in hospital and mortality. From 1 February 2020 to 30 April 2020, the total referrals to ED diagnosed with STEMI, Hip fracture and CVA of which required intervention were 197 within Covid-19 group 2020 compared to 250 in the control group 2019. Mean duration to intervention (PCI, surgery and tPA, respectively) did not differ between COVID-19 group and 2019 group. Among femoral hip fracture patients', the referral numbers to ED were significantly lower in Covid-19 era (p = 0.040) and the hospitalization stay was significantly shorter (p = 0.003). Among CVA patients', we found statistical differences among the number of referrals and the patients' age. Coping with the Covid-19 pandemic presents a challenge for the general healthcare system. Our results suggest that with proper management, despite the obstacles of isolation policies and social distancing, any negative impact on the quality of health care for the non-Covid-19 patients can be minimized in the emergency department setting.","Ben-Haim, Gal; Zabatani, Amit; Orion, David; Leshem, Eyal; Irony, Avinoah; Katorza, Eldad",Intern. emerg. med,221,1

One of the most significant challenges with CP therapy, however, both when defining its efficacy and implementing its approach clinically, is accurately and efficiently characterizing an otherwise heterogenous therapeutic treatment. Given current limitations, our goal is to leverage a SARS antibody testing platform with a newly developed automated endpoint titer analysis program to rapidly define SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in CP donors and hospitalized patients. A newly developed antibody detection platform was used to perform a serial dilution enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgM, and IgA SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Data were then analyzed using commercially available software, GraphPad Prism, or a newly developed program developed in Python called TiterScape, to analyze endpoint titers. Endpoint titer calculations and analysis times were then compared between the two analysis approaches. Serial dilution analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels revealed a high level of heterogeneity between individuals. Commercial platform analysis required significant time for manual data input and extrapolated endpoint titer values when the last serial dilution was above the endpoint cutoff, occasionally producing erroneously high results. By contrast, TiterScape processed 1008 samples for endpoint titer results in roughly 14 minutes compared with the 8 hours required for the commercial software program analysis. Equally important, results generated by TiterScape and Prism were highly similar, with differences averaging 1.26 ± 0.2 percent (mean ± SD). The pandemic has created unprecedented challenges when seeking to accurately test large numbers of individuals for SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels with a rapid turnaround time. ELISA platforms capable of serial dilution analysis coupled with a highly flexible software interface may provide a useful tool when seeking to define endpoint titers in a high-throughput manner.

Yet to our knowledge, no study has compared the antibacterial efficacy of a large collection of hand sanitizers. Using zone of growth inhibition and kill curve assays, we assessed the performance of 46 commercially available hand sanitizers that were obtained from national chain big-box stores, gasoline stations, pharmacies, and boutiques for antibacterial activity toward prototypical Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacterial pathogens. Results revealed substantial variability in the efficacy of many sanitizers evaluated. Formulations following World Health Organization-recommended ingredients (80% ethanol or 75% isopropyl alcohol) or those including benzalkonium chloride as the active principal ingredient displayed excellent antibacterial activity, whereas others exhibited modest or poor activity in the assays performed. Results also revealed that E. coli was generally more susceptible to most sanitizers in comparison to S. aureus and that there was significant strain-to-strain variability in hand sanitizer antimicrobial efficacy regardless of the organism evaluated. Further, tests of a subset of hand sanitizers toward severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) revealed no direct correlation between antibacterial and antiviral performance, with all ethyl alcohol formulations performing equally well and displaying improved activity in comparison to benzalkonium chloride-containing sanitizer. Taken together, these results indicate that there is likely to be substantial variability in the antimicrobial performance of commercially available hand sanitizers, particularly toward bacterial pathogens, and a need to evaluate the efficacy of sanitizers under development.IMPORTANCE In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, hand hygiene has taken on a prominent role in efforts to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission and infection, which has led to a radical increase in the number and types of hand sanitizers manufactured to meet public demand. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated or compared the antimicrobial performance of hand sanitizers that are being produced under COVID-19 emergency authorization. Tests of 46 commercially available hand sanitizers purchased from national chain brick-and-mortar stores revealed considerable variability in their antibacterial performance toward two bacterial pathogens of immediate health care concern, S. aureus and E. coli Expanded testing of a subset of hand sanitizers revealed no direct correlation between antibacterial performance of individual sanitizers and their activity toward SARS-CoV-2. These results indicate that as the pandemic subsides, there will be a need to validate the antimicrobial efficacy of sanitizers being produced.","Chojnacki, M; Dobrotka, C; Osborn, R; Johnson, W; Young, M; Meyer, B; Laskey, E; Wozniak, R A F; Dewhurst, S; Dunman, P M",MSphere,221,16

We performed anticoronavirus immunoglobulin G profiling of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients to better define their underlying humoral response. Design: Blood was collected at predetermined ICU days to measure immunoglobulin G with a research multiplex assay against four severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 proteins/subunits and against all six additionally known human coronaviruses. Setting: Tertiary care ICU and academic laboratory. Subjects: ICU patients suspected of being infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 had blood collected until either polymerase chain reaction testing was confirmed negative on ICU day 3 (coronavirus disease 2019 negative) or until death or discharge if the patient tested polymerase chain reaction positive (coronavirus disease 2019 positive). Interventions: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Age- and sex-matched healthy controls and ICU patients who were either coronavirus disease 2019 positive or coronavirus disease 2019 negative were enrolled. Cohorts were well-balanced with the exception that coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients had greater body mass indexes, presented with bilateral pneumonias more frequently, and suffered lower Pao2:Fio2 ratios, when compared with coronavirus disease 2019 negative patients (p < 0.05). Mortality rate for coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients was 50%. On ICU days 1-3, anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulin G was significantly elevated in coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients, as compared to both healthy control subjects and coronavirus disease 2019 negative patients (p < 0.001). Weak severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus immunoglobulin G serologic responses were also detected, but not other coronavirus subtypes. The four anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulin G were maximal by ICU day 3, with all four anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulin G providing excellent diagnostic potential (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Spike 1 protein immunoglobulin G, area under the curve 1.0, p < 0.0005; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus receptor binding domain immunoglobulin G, area under the curve, 0.93-1.0; p &#8804; 0.0001; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Spike proteins immunoglobulin G, area under the curve, 1.0; p < 0.0001; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Nucleocapsid protein immunoglobulin G area under the curve, 0.90-0.95; p &#8804; 0.0003). Anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulin G increased and/or plateaued over 10 ICU days. Conclusions: Critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients exhibited anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulin G, whereas serologic responses to non-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antigens were weak or absent. Detection of human coronavirus immunoglobulin G against the different immunogenic structural proteins/subunits with multiplex assays may be useful for pathogen identification, patient cohorting, and guiding convalescent plasma therapy.","Fraser, Douglas D; Cepinskas, Gediminas; Slessarev, Marat; Martin, Claudio M; Daley, Mark; Patel, Maitray A; Miller, Michael R; Patterson, Eric K; O039,; Gorman, David B; Gill, Sean E; Oehler, Susanne; Miholits, Markus; Webb, Brian",Crit Care Explor,221,16

However, limited research has examined the change in marijuana use among persons living with HIV (PLWH). This study aimed to investigate how marijuana use changed in a cohort of PLWH during the first year of the pandemic and identify factors associated with the change. METHOD: 222 PLWH (mean age = 50.2 ± 11.2, 50.9 % female, 14.5 % Hispanic, 64.7 % Black, 15.8 % White, 5 % other, 80.2 % persons using marijuana [at least weekly use], 19.8 % persons not using marijuana) completed a baseline survey on demographics and behavioral/health characteristics between 2018 and 2020 and a brief phone survey between May and October 2020 that assessed changes in marijuana use and overall/mental health, and perceived risks/benefits of marijuana use during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: During the pandemic, 64/222(28.8 %) of the whole sample reported increased marijuana use, 36(16.2 %) reported decreased use, and 122(55 %) reported no change. Multinomial logistic regression results indicated that: Compared to those reporting no change, increased marijuana use during the pandemic was associated with more frequent marijuana use and PTSD symptoms at baseline, worsened mental health during the pandemic, and not perceiving marijuana use as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection. More frequent marijuana use at baseline was the only factor significantly associated with decreased marijuana use during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in changes in marijuana use among a considerable proportion (45 %) of PLWH. Future research is needed to understand the temporality of the increases in marijuana use with worsening mental health.","Wang, Yan; Ibañez, Gladys E; Vaddiparti, Krishna; Stetten, Nichole E; Sajdeya, Ruba; Porges, Eric C; Cohen, Ronald A; Cook, Robert L",Drug Alcohol Depend,221,1

high burdened countries, one of which is South Africa South Africa is one of the eight countries that are said to account for the two thirds of the total new Tuberculosis cases The Tuberculosis epidemic is driven by the following reasons: firstly, poor living conditions which are a result of the wide gap between the rich and the poverty stricken among some populations;and, secondly, late presentation to health facilities Over the years, healthcare programs have made a meaningful impact in identifying patients presenting to Tuberculosis care A global Tuberculosis report shows an estimated sixty million lives were saved through Tuberculosis treatment and diagnosis between the years 2000 and 2019 This progress has encouraged the United Nations to set the health target of eradicating the Tuberculosis epidemic by 2030 For this goal to be attained, strategies to modify risk behaviour need to remain a main priority In the South African context, it would be important to note the diversity of the individuals experience which is rooted in South African socio-political history and has resulted in high levels of social inequality and disparate socio-economic status groups, as a significant factor when considering the well-being of Tuberculosis infected South Africans The aim of this research was to understand health related well-being in South Africa, by noting and comparing the diversity of life satisfaction experience between participants from different sociodemographic status groups across South Africa In this interview statistician Motladi Matatiele and

of the behavioural aspects tied to Tuberculosis infection Résumé Quatre-vingt-cinq pour cent des nouveaux cas de tuberculose dans le monde se trouvent dans trente pays, dont l’un d’eux est l’Afrique du Sud L’Afrique du Sud est un des huit pays qui, à eux seuls, regroupent les deux-tiers des nouveaux cas de tuberculose L’épidémie de tuberculose, due à de piètres conditions de vie, tant sanitaires que sociales, est le résultat d’un fossé entre les riches et les pauvres et d’une prise en charge médicale parfois trop tardive de ces derniers Toutefois, année après année, les programmes sanitaires ont eu un impact positif sur l’identification des patients souffrant de tuberculose Un rapport global sur la maladie montre que quelques soixante millions de vies ont été sauvées grâce aux diagnostics et traitements entre les années 2000 et 2019 Un tel progrès a encouragé les Nations Unies à établir comme objectif médical l’éradication de l’épidémie de tuberculose à l’horizon de 2030 Afin d’atteindre ce but, les stratégies de modifications des comportements à risques doivent rester la première priorité Dans le contexte sud-africain, il est primordial de prendre en compte la diversité des expériences individuelles qui est ancrée dans l’histoire sociopolitique du pays (l’Apartheid) et dont ont résulté de hauts niveaux d’inégalités socioéconomiques parmi les différents groupes de populations Cette histoire est un facteur des plus signifiants lorsqu’on s’intéresse à la qualité de vie des Sud-Africains atteints de tuberculose Dans cet entretien, la statisticienne Motladi Matatiele et la démographe Nancy Stiegler de l’University of the Western Cape font part de leur recherche, dont l’objectif était de comprendre la diversité des facteurs associés au bien-être des personnes souffrant de tuberculose en Afrique du Sud, considérant des patients appartenant à divers groupes et statuts socioéconomiques La discussion prend en compte les variables les plus influentes sur la qualité de vie, en utilisant les données de l’enquête « National Income Dynamic Study » de 2017 L’accent a été mis sur la sous-population souffrant de tuberculose disséminée dans les neuf provinces du pays L’échantillon consiste en quarante-quatre individus dont on a considéré les variables suivantes : l’âge, le sexe, le groupe ethnique, le lieu de résidence en 1994 (date de fin officielle du régime ségrégationniste), l’activité, l’éducation, la santé, la santé mentale, le bien-être et la cohésion sociale L’étude a employé l’Analyse des correspondances multiples pour identifier les variables associées au bien-être des individus souffrant de tuberculose Les résultats montrent que les répondants de descendance africaine rapportaient les plus bas niveaux de bien-être, suivis des participants métis, qui avaient, d’autre part, plus de chances de fumer, ce qui décroissait d’autant leur niveau ressenti de bien-être Le sexe s’est révélé être un facteur signifiant dans la mesure où les femmes ont déclaré un niveau subjectif de bien-être systématiquement plus bas que celui déclaré par leurs homologues masculins Les participants souffrant de co-infections de tuberculose et du VIH, aussi les plus touchés par la grande pauvreté, présentaient le niveau le plus bas possible de bien-être ressenti Ces derniers étaient les plus déprimés à cause des stigmates perçus, de la peur induite par leurs systèmes immunitaires affaiblis et de la prise aléatoire de leurs prescriptions pharmaceutiques L’Organisation mondiale de la santé, dans ses bulletins mensuels, a noté que l’accès aux traitements préventifs et curatifs de la tuberculose en Afrique du Sud s’est effondré de plus de cinquante pour cent entre mars et juin 2020 Il est regrettable que l’Afrique du Sud n’ait pas tenu les objectifs « 90-90-90 » fixés par son plan global d’éradication de la tuberculose en 2016 Dans le même temps, l’Organisation mondiale de la santé estime une augmentation de vingt p ur cent des cas ces dernières années Les résultats de l’étude permettent de déduire qu’une augmentation des cas de tuberculose est corrélée avec une augmentation de la pauvreté, des co-infections, d’une éducation à la santé médiocre et d’une accentuation du sentiment de rejet Il est alors possible de penser qu’entre 2017 et 2020, le degré de satisfaction et de bien-être des populations souffrant de tuberculose a décru, décroissance à laquelle l’épidémie de COVID-19 a pu largement contribuer Les institutions en charge des questions de santé publique doivent contrôler les tendances des épidémies avec la plus grande attention, dans la mesure où une réponse rapide est nécessaire pour corriger les effets néfastes de la COVID-19 sur l’éradication de la

The biologic studies show that the target receptor for the virus might be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This peptide is responsible for converting angiotensin II (Ang II), which is a profoundly active peptide, into Ang 1-7 with quite a balancing barbell function. It is emphasized that the direct target of the virus is ACE2 underlining the obvious difference with ACE. Nevertheless, we hypothesized that a back load build up effect on Ang II may usurp the ACE capacity and subsequently leave the bradykinin system unabated. We think there are clinical clues for dry cough and the presumed aggravating role of ACE inhibitors like captopril on the disease process. Thereby, we speculated that inhibition of bradykinin synthesis and/or blockade of bradykinin B2 receptor using Aprotinin/ecallantide and Icatibant, respectively, may hold therapeutic promise in severe cases and these molecules can be advanced to clinical trials.","Ghahestani, Seyed-Mohammad; Mahmoudi, Javad; Hajebrahimi, Sakineh; Sioofy-Khojine, Amir-Babak; Salehi-Pourmehr, Hanieh; Sadeghi-Ghyassi, Fatemeh; Mostafaei, Hadi",Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol,221,16

COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decrease in elective and emergency admissions in the majority of neurosurgical centers. The main hypothesis was that fear of COVID-19 may have prevented patients with critical medical or surgical emergencies from actively presenting in emergency departments and outpatient clinics. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective, observational study searching our institutional data regarding the incidence of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and compare the admissions in two different periods: the pre COVID-19 with the COVID-19 period. RESULTS: The study cohort was comprised of a total of 99 patients. The mean (SD) weekly case rate of patients with SAH was 1.1 (1.1) during the pre-COVID-19 period, compared to 1.7 (1.4) during the COVID-19 period. Analysis revealed that the volume of admitted patients with SAH was 1.5-fold higher during the COVID period compared to the pre-COVID period and this was statistically significant (ExpB = 1.5, CI 95% 1-2.3, p = 0.044). Difference in mortality did not reach any statistical significance between the two periods (p = 0.097), as well as patients' length of stay (p = 0.193). CONCLUSIONS: The presented data cover a more extended time period than so far published reports; it is reasonable that our recent experience may well be demonstrating a general realistic trend of overall increase in aneurysmal rupture rates during lockdown. Hospitalization of patients with SAH cannot afford any reductions in facilities, equipment, or personnel if optimum outcomes are desirable.","Theofanopoulos, Andreas; Fermeli, Dionysia; Boulieris, Spyros; Kalantzis, George; Kefalopoulou, Zinovia; Panagiotopoulos, Vasilios; Papadakos, Dimitrios; Constantoyannis, Constantine",Neurol. sci,221,24

Airway management for such patients during the COVID-19 pandemic including tracheal intubation, lung isolation, one-lung ventilation and flexible bronchoscopy may pose a significant risk to healthcare professionals and patients. That said, there remains a need for timely thoracic surgery for patients with lung cancer or thoracic trauma. The thoracic anaesthetic community has been confronted with the need to modify existing techniques to maximise safety for patients and healthcare professionals. With appropriate modification, aerosol generation may be mitigated against in most circumstances.

We propose four key differences based on distinct views on people centricity, the role of the people in the leadership process, the problem solving approach and the preferred leader role. Given the key function that meaning plays in leadership discourse, in particular during times of uncertainty and change, we further propose that populist leaders make use of simplistic meaning-making systems that emphasize monistic and over-simplified views around polarized options, while servant leaders in contrast use complex meaning-making systems that emphasize pluralist and reconciled views towards shared problem solving. Considering that populist leadership often makes references to serving, humility and self-sacrifice in defence of the people, we find it important to distinguish it from servant leadership. We advance, in fact, that servant leaders can function as an antidote to populism, being a genuine people centred approach with a reconciliatory and pluralist view and an adequate (but surely not perfect) response to many of our societal problems. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) MAD statement Populism is on the rise, even in well-established democracies. Driven by galloping inequality, technological disruption, growing migration, and a resurge of nationalistic sentiments, populist leaders seem to strive on an overall feeling of insecurity and resentment. The recent COVID19 crisis has contributed to this trend. Populist speeches are often infused with an apparent motivation to serve the people and leader self-sacrifice. In this article we want to dispel this apparent similarity with servant leadership and expose the contrast between the two.

Positive psychology has for several years been dealing with this concept, which is well known to the general public, but which has been the subject of major conceptual development in the field of science. It seems to us that the concept of optimism can be particularly useful in understanding and influencing the behaviour of our fellow citizens during the period of confinement that is currently imposed on everyone, in the same way that we must consider the consequences in the short, medium and long term, both economically and in terms of the moral and physical health of our fellow citizens, that is, after the period of confinement. Traditionally, being optimistic means being confident in the positive outcome of an event, whereas pessimism means expecting the worst. The uncertainty that this virus imposes on us and the new situations that it brings about, forces us to think the world in uncertain terms, which can be destabilizing. Understanding the contribution of the concept of optimism in the potential of the adaptive processes that each of us may or may not be able to mobilize to face and adapt to this unprecedented and unprecedented health crisis is essential. This will undoubtedly be a major challenge for the social sciences and psychology. This is why we believe that the concept of optimism can help to provide additional insights that will enable us to better grasp the rational (or non-rational) behaviours that we may face in the future, and in which we are already involved.","Martin-Krumm, Charles; Tarquinio, Cyril; Tarquinio, Camille",Ann. med.-psychol,221,19

Due to their effectiveness at filtering aerosols that could potentially contain viruses, the N95-type filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are frequently used by healthcare workers and first responders. However, due to a shortage of domestic N95 FFRs in the US at the beginning of the pandemic, internationally produced respirators were imported and deployed under an Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration. Due to concerns raised at the time, there was an urgent need to verify their effectiveness and usability. In this study, we summarize our characterization of the nanoparticulate filtration performances of 136 such respirators, measured between April 1 and June 30, 2020. Our results indicate that about 42% of the respirators showed filtration efficiencies better than 90% (≤10% penetration), but only 17% performed better than 95% (≤5% penetration). On the other hand, about 35% showed filtration efficiencies below 80% (≥20% penetration). A representative subset of devices was analyzed for the origin of such variations in filtration performance. We found that filtration efficiency increased with the level of electrostatic charge on the FFRs and that the poor performance of the internationally sourced FFRs could be traced to a lack of electrostatic filtration mechanisms. Furthermore, electrostatics shifted the particle size at which aerosol penetration through the FFR was maximal from around 200 nm to less than 100 nm for the highest-performing FFRs, a size range that largely goes undetected in standardized tests. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","Hao, J.; Passos De Oliveira Santos, R.; Rutledge, G.

Respondents get the nutrition information 42.9% by virtual media, 29.2% from health workers, 10% from family, 7.14% from friends, and 9.29% others did not get nutritional information. The most reliable source of information is from health workers, both delivered virtually or face to face. Most of them had difficulty recognizing the amount of energy needed, selecting a healthy diet, arranging meal plans, and managing dietary behavior challenges.

We retrospectively analyzed a COVID-19 cohort recruited during the first 40 days of the epidemic in Italy. We examined the association between obesity and 30-day mortality, admission to ICU, mortality and length of hospital stay in patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: Demographic, clinical and outcome data were retrospectively analyzed in 331 patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital between 21 February and 31 March 2020. The predictive effect of obesity on mortality was assessed using a Cox proportional-hazard regression model, its effect on ICU admission and mortality in the ICU using logistic regressions, and its effect on length of hospital stay using a linear regression. Seventy-four of 331 patients had a BMI &#8805;30 kg/m2. Among obese patients, 21 (28.4%) required admission in ICU and 25 died (33.8%). After controlling for sex, age, comorbidities and clinical data, obesity was not significantly associated with mortality, mortality in ICU and length of hospital stay. The effect of obesity on ICU admission remained significant after controlling for sex, age, interstitial lung disease, heart disease and serum C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Obese patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be admitted to ICU than non-obese patients. However, there were no significant differences in mortality between the two groups.","Biscarini, Simona; Colaneri, Marta; Ludovisi, Serena; Seminari, Elena; Pieri, Teresa C; Valsecchi, Pietro; Gallazzi, Ilaria; Giusti, Emanuele; Cammà, Calogero; Zuccaro, Valentina; Mondelli, Mario U",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,221,23

Purpose: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of anemia in Korean adolescents over the past 21 years using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Methods: We investigated the prevalence of anemia in adolescents aged 10-18 years for the period 1998-2018 according to sex, age, residential area, and household income. The effects of menarche age and menstruation were examined in female adolescents for the period 2001-2018. Results: Among the total 11,782 participants, the weighted prevalence of anemia was 4.0%. The prevalence of anemia in male participants significantly decreased (from 3.0% to 0.5%, p < 0.001), whereas that in female participants did not change significantly over time (from 7.9% to 8.5%, p = 0.054). The average age at menarche was 12.4 ± 0.0 years; the prevalence of anemia in females increased from age 13 years onward.

Due to inequalities from residential segregation, Hispanic and Black populations have challenges in meeting health expectations. However, segregated neighborhoods also support the formation of social bonds that relate to healthy behaviors. We evaluate the question of non-White distancing using social mobility data from Google on three sites: workplaces, grocery stores, and recreational locations. Employing hierarchical linear modeling and geographically weighted regression, we find the relation of race/ethnicity to COVID-19 distancing is varied across the United States. The HLM models show that compared to Black populations, Hispanic populations overall more effectively distance from recreation sites and grocery stores: each point increase in percent Hispanic was related to residents being 0.092 percent less likely (p< 0.05) to visit recreational sites and 0.127 percent less likely (p< 0.01) to visit grocery stores since the onset of COVID-19. However, the GWR models show there are places where the percent Black is locally related to recreation distancing while percent Hispanic is not. Further, these models show the association of percent Black to recreation and grocery distancing can be locally as strong as 1.057 percent (p< 0.05) and 0.989 percent (p< 0.05), respectively. Next, the HLM models identified that Black/White residential isolation was related to less distancing, with each point of isolation residents were 11.476 percent more likely (p< 0.01) to go to recreational sites and 7.493 percent more likely (p< 0.05) to visit grocery stores compared to before COVID-19. These models did not find a measurable advantage/disadvantage for Black populations in these places compared to White populations.

However, current evidence is rather based on limited measurements, losing sight of the temporal pattern of these changes. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal analysis on a prospective cohort of COVID-19 patients followed up for more than 6 months. Neutralizing activity was evaluated using HIV reporter pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein. IgG antibody titer was evaluated by ELISA against the S2 subunit, the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the nucleoprotein (NP). Statistical analyses were carried out using mixed-effects models. Findings: We found that individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection experienced an insignificant decay in neutralizing activity, which persisted six months after symptom onset or diagnosis. Hospitalized individuals showed higher neutralizing titers, which decreased following a two-phase pattern, with an initial rapid decline that significantly slowed after day 80. Despite this initial decay, neutralizing activity at six months remained higher among hospitalized individuals compared to mild symptomatic. The slow decline in neutralizing activity at mid-term contrasted with the steep slope of anti-RBD, S2 or NP antibody titers, all of them showing a constant decline over the follow-up period. Conclusions: Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the quality of the neutralizing immune response against SARS-CoV-2 evolves over the post-convalescent stage.

We examined differences over the 2 years after discharge in mortality, healthcare utilisation and frailty score between elderly survivors of ARI in the ICU and an elderly control population. METHODS: We used 2009-2017 data from 39 hospital discharge databases. Patients &#8805; 80 years old discharged alive from ICU hospitalisation for acute respiratory infection were propensity score-matched with controls (cataract surgery) discharged from the hospital at the same time and adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities present before hospitalisation. We reported 2-year mortality and compared healthcare utilisation and frailty scores in the 2-year periods before and after ICU hospitalisation. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred and twenty elderly survivors of acute respiratory infection in the ICU were discharged, and 988 were successfully matched with controls. After discharge, patients had a 10.1-fold [95% CI, 6.1-17.3] higher risk of death at 6 months and 3.6-fold [95% CI, 2.9-4.6] higher risk of death at 2 years compared with controls.

CONCLUSIONS: We observed a substantially increased rate of death in the years following ICU hospitalisation for elderly patients along with elevated healthcare resource use and accelerated age-associated decline as assessed by frailty score. These findings provide data for better informed goals-of-care discussions and may help target post-ICU discharge services.","Guillon, Antoine; Hermetet, Coralie; Barker, Kimberly A; Jouan, Youenn; Gaborit, Christophe; Ehrmann, Stephan; Le Manach, Yannick; Dequin, Pierre-François; Grammatico-Guillon, Leslie",Crit Care,221,16

Many scientific questions about SARS-CoV-2 and Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were raised and urgently need to be answered, including the susceptibility of animals to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we tested whether tree shrew, an emerging experimental animal domesticated from wild animal, is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No clinical signs were observed in SARS-CoV-2 inoculated tree shrews during this experiment except the increasing body temperature particularly in female animals. Low levels of virus shedding and replication in tissues occurred in all three age groups. Notably, young tree shrews (6 months to 12 months) showed virus shedding at the earlier stage of infection than adult (2 years to 4 years) and old (5 years to 7 years) animals that had longer duration of virus shedding comparatively. Histopathological examine revealed that pulmonary abnormalities were the main changes but mild although slight lesions were also observed in other tissues.

OBJECTIVE: The scientific community, citizens, politicians, and mass media are expressing concerns regarding data suggesting that the number of COVID-19-related deaths in Italy is significantly higher than in the rest of the world. Moreover, Italian citizens have misleading perceptions related to the number of swab tests that have actually been performed. Citizens and mass media are denouncing the coverage of COVID-19 swab testing in Italy, claiming that it is not in line with that in other countries worldwide. METHODS: In this paper, we attempt to clarify the aspects of COVID-19 fatalities and testing in Italy by performing a set of statistical analyses that highlight the actual numbers in Italy and compare them with official worldwide data. RESULTS: The analysis clearly shows that the Italian COVID-19 fatality and mortality rates are in line with the official world scenario, as are the numbers of COVID-19 tests performed in Italy and in the Lombardy region. CONCLUSIONS: This up-to-date analysis may elucidate the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy.","Tosi, Davide; Verde, Alessandro; Verde, Manuela",J Med Internet Res,221,16

A huge number of people have lost their lives due to this pandemic. Early detection of COVID-19 infection is helpful for treatment and quarantine. Therefore, many researchers have designed a deep learning model for the early diagnosis of COVID-19-infected patients. However, deep learning models suffer from overfitting and hyperparameter-tuning issues. To overcome these issues, in this paper, a metaheuristic-based deep COVID-19 screening model is proposed for X-ray images. The modified AlexNet architecture is used for feature extraction and classification of the input images. Strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm-II (SPEA-II) is used to tune the hyperparameters of modified AlexNet. The proposed model is tested on a four-class (i.e., COVID-19, tuberculosis, pneumonia, or healthy) dataset.

To conduct population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in the United States, the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) was created using the existing infrastructure of the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) (4) and the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET). This report presents age-stratified COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates for patients admitted during March 1-28, 2020, and clinical data on patients admitted during March 1-30, 2020, the first month of U.S. surveillance. Among 1,482 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 74.5% were aged &#8805;50 years, and 54.4% were male. The hospitalization rate among patients identified through COVID-NET during this 4-week period was 4.6 per 100,000 population. Rates were highest (13.8) among adults aged &#8805;65 years. Among 178 (12%) adult patients with data on underlying conditions as of March 30, 2020, 89.3% had one or more underlying conditions; the most common were hypertension (49.7%), obesity (48.3%), chronic lung disease (34.6%), diabetes mellitus (28.3%), and cardiovascular disease (27.8%). These findings suggest that older adults have elevated rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and the majority of persons hospitalized with COVID-19 have underlying medical conditions. These findings underscore the importance of preventive measures (e.g., social distancing, respiratory hygiene, and wearing face coverings in public settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain) to protect older adults and persons with underlying medical conditions, as well as the general public. In addition, older adults and persons with serious underlying medical conditions should avoid contact with persons who are ill and immediately contact their health care provider(s) if they have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) (5). Ongoing monitoring of hospitalization rates, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalized patients will be important to better understand the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 in the United States and the clinical spectrum of disease, and to help guide planning and prioritization of health care system resources.","Garg, Shikha; Kim, Lindsay; Whitaker, Michael; O039,; Halloran, Alissa; Cummings, Charisse; Holstein, Rachel; Prill, Mila; Chai, Shua J; Kirley, Pam D; Alden, Nisha B; Kawasaki, Breanna; Yousey-Hindes, Kimberly; Niccolai, Linda; Anderson, Evan J; Openo, Kyle P; Weigel, Andrew; Monroe, Maya L; Ryan, Patricia; Henderson, Justin; Kim, Sue; Como-Sabetti, Kathy; Lynfield, Ruth; Sosin, Daniel; Torres, Salina; Muse, Alison; Bennett, Nancy M; Billing, Laurie; Sutton, Melissa; West, Nicole; Schaffner, William; Talbot, H Keipp; Aquino, Clarissa; George, Andrea; Budd, Alicia; Brammer, Lynnette; Langley, Gayle; Hall, Aron J; Fry, Alicia",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,221,25

Ivermectin is among the drugs whose effectiveness in treatment has been investigated. In this study; it was aimed to investigate the presence of gene mutations that alter ivermectin metabolism and cause toxic effects in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ivermectin use in the treatment of patients without mutation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with severe COVID19 pneumonia were included in the study, which was planned as a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind phase 3 study. Two groups, the study group and the control group, took part in the study. Ivermectin 200 mcg/kg/day for 5 days in the form of a solution prepared for enteral use added to the reference treatment protocol -hydroxychloroquine + favipiravir + azithromycin- of patients included in the study group. Patients in the control group were given only reference treatment with 3 other drugs without ivermectin. The presence of mutations was investigated by performing sequence analysis in the mdr1/abcab1 gene with the Sanger method in patients included in the study group according to randomization. Patients with mutations were excluded from the study and ivermectin treatment was not continued. Patients were followed for 5 days after treatment. At the end of the treatment and follow-up period, clinical response and changes in laboratory parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 66 patients, 36 in the study group and 30 in the control group were included in the study. Mutations affecting ivermectin metabolism was detected in genetic tests of six (16.7%) patients in the study group and they were excluded from the study. At the end of the 5-day follow-up period, the rate of clinical improvement was 73.3% (22/30) in the study group and was 53.3% (16/30) in the control group (p = 0.10). At the end of the study, mortality developed in 6 patients (20%) in the study group and in 9 (30%) patients in the control group (p = 0.37). At the end of the follow-up period, the average peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) values of the study and control groups were found to be 93.5 and 93.0%, respectively. Partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/FiO2 ratios were determined as 236.3 ± 85.7 and 220.8 ± 127.3 in the study and control groups, respectively. While the blood lymphocyte count was higher in the study group compared to the control group (1698 ± 1438 and 1256 ± 710, respectively) at the end of the follow-up period (p = 0.24); reduction in serum C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer levels was more pronounced in the study group (p = 0.02, p = 0.005 and p = 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: According to the findings obtained, ivermectin can provide an increase in clinical recovery, improvement in prognostic laboratory parameters and a decrease in mortality rates even when used in patients with severe COVID-19. Consequently, ivermectin should be considered as an alternative drug that can be used in the treatment of COVID-19 disease or as an additional option to existing protocols.","Okumus, Nurullah; Demirtürk, Nese; Çetinkaya, Riza Aytaç; Güner, Rahmet; Avci, Ismail Yasar; Orhan, Semiha; Konya, Petek; Saylan, Bengü; Karalezli, Aysegül; Yamanel, Levent; Kayaaslan, Bircan; Yilmaz, Gülden; Savasçi, Ümit; Eser, Fatma; Taskin, Gürhan",BMC Infect Dis,221,31

The discovery and production of antiviral NPs remain challenging due to low abundance in their native hosts. Reconstruction of NP biosynthetic pathways in microbes is a promising solution to overcome this limitation. In this review, we surveyed 23 most prominent NPs (from more than 200 antiviral NP candidates) with distinct antiviral mode of actions and summarized the recent metabolic engineering effort to produce these compounds in various microbial hosts. We envision that the scalable and low-cost production of novel antiviral NPs, enabled by metabolic engineering, may light the hope to control and eradicate the deadliest viruses that plague our society and humanity.","Ma, Jingbo; Gu, Yang; Xu, Peng",Curr Opin Biotechnol,221,21

Its spread resulted in a pandemic, with the United Kingdom entering a period of national lockdown on 23 March 2020 to reduce disease burden on the National Health Service (NHS). King's College Hospital is a Major Trauma Centre serving an inner-city population of 700,000 with 120,000 patients attending the emergency department (ED) annually. We aimed to determine the effect of lockdown on OMFS trauma presentations and lessons learned from emergency service provision during a pandemic. All referrals to the oral and maxillofacial surgical (OMFS) team from ED during the first six weeks of the lockdown period - 23 March 2020 - 3 May 2020 - were compared with the same six-week period in 2019. A total of 111 referrals were made to OMFS during the first six weeks of the lockdown period in 2020 compared with 380 referrals in 2019. Of these, 50.5%, (n=192) were related to facial trauma in 2019 vs (63.1%, n=70) in 2020. Fewer patients were admitted under OMFS: 17.4% (n=35) in 2019 vs 2.9% (n=2) in 2020, and a greater number of patients were discharged from OMFS care directly from the ED: 63.2% (n=127) in 2019 vs 82.9% (n=58) in 2020. There was profound effect of the lockdown on referrals to OMFS from the ED, in number and type of diagnosis. This is potentially reflective of the increased availability of acute/emergency dental services in South-East London during the lockdown period. This gives us valuable insight for service planning in the event of further restrictions.","Yeung, E; Brandsma, D S; Karst, F W; Smith, C; Fan, K F M",Br. j. oral maxillofac. surg,221,16

Early isolation precautions and accurate testing are therefore crucial in preventing the spread of nosocomial infection. This case of an elderly, 80-year-old man, discusses one of the first reported cases of COVID-19 in Texas and addresses the topics of nosocomial spread due to inaccurate RT-PCR testing, underused isolation precautions, and atypical presentation in extremes of age.

The immune system has emerged as a key determinant in shaping the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is mainly the deleterious unconstrained immune response, rather than the virus itself, which leads to severe cases of COVID-19 and the associated mortality. Genetic susceptibility to dysregulated immune response is highly likely to be among the host factors for adverse disease outcome. Given that such genetic susceptibility has also been observed in autoimmune diseases (ADs), a number of critical questions remain unanswered; whether individuals with ADs have a significantly different risk for COVID-19-related complications compared to the general population, and whether studies on the genetics of ADs can shed some light on the host factors in COVID-19. In this perspective, we discuss the host genetic factors, which have been under investigation in association with COVID-19 severity. We touch upon the intricate link between autoimmunity and COVID-19 pathophysiology. We put forth a number of autoimmune susceptibility genes, which have the potential to be additional host genetic factors for modifying the severity of COVID-19 presentation. In summary, host genetics at the intersection of ADs and COVID-19 may serve as a source for understanding the heterogeneity of COVID-19 severity, and hence, potentially holds a key in achieving effective strategies in risk group identification, as well as effective treatments.","Karaderi, Tugce; Bareke, Halin; Kunter, Imge; Seytanoglu, Adil; Cagnan, Ilgin; Balci, Deniz; Barin, Burc; Hocaoglu, Mevhibe B; Rahmioglu, Nilufer; Asilmaz, Esra; Taneri, Bahar",Front Immunol,221,24

However, when a similar virus spread globally triggering the COVID-19 pandemic, we were harshly reminded that several other neglected diseases might also be waiting for the perfect opportunity to become mainstream. As climate change drives urbanization, natural selection of pathogens and their intermediate vectors and reservoirs, the risk of neglected diseases emerging within a larger susceptible pool becomes an even greater threat. Availability of a vaccine for COVID-19 is widely considered the only way to end this pandemic. Similarly, vaccines are also seen as the best tools available to control the spread of neglected (sometimes referred to as emerging or re-emerging) diseases, until the water, hygiene and sanitation infrastructure is improved in areas of their prevalence. Vaccine production is usually cost and labour intensive and thus minimal funding is directed towards controlling and eliminating neglected diseases (NDs). A customised but sustainable approach is needed to develop and deploy vaccines against NDs.

RESULTS: A total of 1549 COVID-19 cases were included (median age 69 years (IQR 55.0-81.0), 57.5% men). 78.2% had at least one underlying comorbidity, the most frequent was hypertension (55.8%). Most frequent symptoms at presentation were fever (75.3%), cough (65.7%) and dyspnoea (58.1%). 81 (5.8%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (median age 62 years (IQR 51-71); 74.1% men; median length of stay 9 days (IQR 5-19)) 82.7% of them needed invasive ventilation support. 1393 patients had an outcome at the end of the study period (case fatality ratio: 21.2% (296/1393)). The independent factors associated with fatality (OR; 95% CI): age (1.07; 1.06 to 1.09), male sex (2.86; 1.85 to 4.50), neurological disease (1.93; 1.19 to 3.13), chronic kidney disease (2.83; 1.40 to 5.71) and neoplasia (4.29; 2.40 to 7.67). The percentage of hospital beds occupied with COVID-19 almost doubled (702/361), with the number of patients in ICU quadrupling its capacity (32/8). Median length of stay was 9 days (IQR 6-14). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides clinical characteristics, complications and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 admitted to a European secondary hospital. Fatal outcomes were similar to those reported by hospitals with a higher level of complexity.","Jiménez, Eva; Fontán-Vela, Mario; Valencia, Jorge; Fernandez-Jimenez, Ines; Álvaro-Alonso, Elena Alba; Izquierdo-García, Elsa; Lazaro Cebas, Andrea; Gallego Ruiz-Elvira, Elisa; Troya, Jesús; Tebar-Martinez, Ana Josefa; Garcia-Marina, Belén; Peña-Lillo, Gabriela; Abad-Motos, Ane; Macaya, Laura; Ryan, Pablo; Pérez-Butragueño, Mario",BMJ Open,221,20

During an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the LTCF an effective screening tool is essential to identify the patients at risk for severe disease. We explored the role of interleukin 6 (IL-6) as a predictor for severe disease during the outbreak of Covid-19 in one LTCF in Slovakia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective data analysis of cases of COVID-19, diagnosed during the outbreak in one LTCF in Slovakia between April 11, 2020, and May 5, 2020. Within 24 h after the diagnosis of Covid-19, clinical and laboratory screening was performed in the LTCF to identify patients in need of hospitalization. Patients with oxygen saturation below 90% were immediately referred to the hospital. Patients staying in the LFTC were monitored daily and those that developed hypoxemia were transferred to the hospital. We analyzed the association between the IL-6 at the initial assessment and development of hypoxemia during follow up and determined the cut-off of the IL-6 able to predict the development of hypoxemia requiring oxygen therapy. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (11 men, 42 women) with diagnosed Covid-19 were included in the analysis. 19 (53%) patients developed hypoxemia during the disease. Patients with hypoxemia had significantly higher concentrations of IL-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase at initial screening. ROC analyses identified IL-6 as the most robust predictor of hypoxemia. The concentration of IL-6 > 24 pg/mL predicted the development of hypoxemia with the sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 88.9%. The positive and negative predictive values were 76.9, and 100% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The concentration of IL-6 > 24 pg/mL at initial assessment predicted the development of hypoxemia requiring hospitalization with excellent sensitivity and good specificity. IL-6 appears as a potential predictor for the development of the severe Covid-19 and might serve for early identification of patients in need of hospitalization. Further studies are needed to evaluate the robustness of the use of IL-6 as an effective screening tool for the severe course of Covid-19.","Sabaka, P; Koscálová, A; Straka, I; Hodosy, J; Lipták, R; Kmotorková, B; Kachlíková, M; Kusnírová, A",BMC Infect Dis,221,1

The objective of the present narrative review is to discuss the use of melatonin as an early treatment option on the first day of diagnosis for COVID-19. METHODS: The MeSH terms ""COVID-19"" and ""viral diseases"" were manually searched on PubMed and relevant articles were included. RESULTS: Results showed that melatonin acts to reduce reactive-oxygen-species mediated damage, cytokine-induced inflammation, and lymphopenia in viral diseases similar to COVID-19.

METHODS: We evaluated all confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University between January 10 and February 29, 2020. We divided these patients into two groups: patients with initial gastrointestinal symptoms (group A, n = 183) and patients with respiratory syndrome and/or fever (group B, n = 1228). The clinical characteristics, radiological features, and laboratory data were assessed. RESULTS: The clinical procedures of both groups underwent 1-2 weeks rising period and were downward trend at 3 weeks; less than 5% of patients progressed to critical illness. In both groups, mean leukocyte count (P = 0.354) and lymphocyte count (P = 0.386) were below normal, and C-reactive protein level was elevated (P = 0.412).

These restriction factors are constitutively expressed, but triggered upon infection by interferons. Both pre-integration and post-integration events of the HIV-1 life cycle appear to play distinct roles in the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), many of which encode antiviral restriction factors. However, HIV-1 counteracts the mechanisms mediated by these restriction factors through its encoded components. Here, we review the recent findings of pathways that lead to the induction of ISGs, and the mechanisms employed by the restriction factors such as IFITMs, APOBEC3s, MX2, and ISG15 in preventing HIV-1 replication. We also reflect on the current understanding of the counter-mechanisms employed by HIV-1 to evade innate immune responses and overcome host restriction factors. Overall, this mini-review provides recent insights into the HIV-1-host cross talk bridging the understanding between intracellular immunity and research avenues in the field of therapeutic interventions against HIV-1.","Chintala, Kumaraswami; Mohareer, Krishnaveni; Banerjee, Sharmistha",Front Immunol,221,1

Conformational information was included considering the optimised geometries and the docked structures of a series of disulfide compounds potentially useful as SARS-CoV protease inhibitors. The traditional analysis (based on flat-shape molecules) proved itself as the most effective technique, which means that, despite the undeniable importance of conformation for biomolecular behaviour, this type of information did not bring relevant contributions for MIA-QSAR modelling. Consequently, promising drug candidates were proposed on the basis of MIA-plot analyses, which account for PLS regression coefficients and variable importance in projection scores of the MIA-QSAR model.","Daré, Joyce K.; Silva, Daniela R.; Ramalho, Teodorico C.; Freitas, Matheus P.",Mol.

Many bacterial species were recently reported to exhibit several distinct swimming modes-the flagella may, for example, push the cell body or wrap around it. How do the different run modes shape the chemotaxis strategy of a multimode swimmer? Here, we investigate chemotactic motion of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida as a model organism. By simultaneously tracking the position of the cell body and the configuration of its flagella, we demonstrate that individual run modes show different chemotactic responses in nutrition gradients and, thus, constitute distinct behavioral states. On the basis of an active particle model, we demonstrate that switching between multiple run states that differ in their speed and responsiveness provides the basis for robust and efficient chemotaxis in complex natural habitats.","Alirezaeizanjani, Zahra; Großmann, Robert; Pfeifer, Veronika; Hintsche, Marius; Beta, Carsten",Sci.

Emerging evidence demonstrates that older individuals and people with underlying metabolic conditions of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality. The SARS-CoV-2 infects humans through the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) receptor. The ACE-2 receptor is a part of the dual system renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) consisting of ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis and ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis. In metabolic disorders and with increased age, it is known that there is an upregulation of ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis with a downregulation of ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis. The activated ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis leads to pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects in respiratory system, vascular dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, nephropathy, and insulin secretory defects with increased insulin resistance. On the other hand, the ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis has anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects on the respiratory system and anti-inflammatory, antioxidative stress, and protective effects on vascular function, protects against myocardial fibrosis, nephropathy, pancreatitis, and insulin resistance. In effect, the balance between these two axes may determine the prognosis. The already strained ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas in metabolic disorders is further stressed due to the use of the ACE-2 by the virus for entry, which affects the prognosis in terms of respiratory compromise. Further evidence needs to be gathered on whether modulation of the renin angiotensin system would be advantageous due to upregulation of Mas activation or harmful due to the concomitant ACE-2 receptor upregulation in the acute management of COVID-19.","Dalan, Rinkoo; Bornstein, Stefan R; El-Armouche, Ali; Rodionov, Roman N; Markov, Alexander; Wielockx, Ben; Beuschlein, Felix; Boehm, Bernhard O",Horm Metab Res,221,16

In this study, we aim to confirm whether it is necessary to do CT scans in SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infections by summarizing the longitudinal chest CT and clinical features of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. Methods: A total of 33 individuals (14 men and 19 women) with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical data of CT positive and negative groups were compared. Longitudinal chest CT scans were reviewed for CT features and analyzed for temporal change. Results: Thirty-two (97%) individuals had positive results for first RT-PCR testing. For clinical data, only monocyte count showed a significant difference between CT positive and negative groups. For first chest CT, only eighteen (54.5%) individuals had abnormal manifestations, common CT features were GGO (88.9%) and consolidation (33.3%), the median number of segments involved was 3.0 (1.0-7.5). No case in CT negative group was abnormal on the follow-up CT. Three patterns of evolution throughout series of CT were observed in CT positive group, including gradual improvement (12, 66.7%), mismatch to improvement (3, 16.7%) and mild progression to improvement (3, 16.7%). On last CT scans, most cases had radiographic improvement but residual abnormalities. Significant differences were exhibited in density, long diameter, number of lung segments involved, and percentage of consolidation between the first and last CT scans. All cases had stable conditions and finally confirmed negative for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests without developing into severe pneumonia. Conclusion: Considering poor performance of CT in screening, stable conditions during followup, and good outcomes in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, we confirm that it is unnecessary to do CT scans in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Chen, Ting; Guo, Dajing; Lu, Jianguo; Xiang, Bo; Li, Xiang; Nie, Jianghua; He, Xiaojing; Li, Kunhua",Int J Med Sci,221,16

These findings were supported by improved blood glucose, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein values. The beneficial effects of BAT were more pronounced in individuals with overweight or obesity, indicating that BAT might play a role in mitigating the deleterious effects of obesity.

Here we propose a neurophysiological account attributing these perceptual capacity limits directly to limits on cerebral cellular metabolism. We hypothesized that overall cerebral energy supply remains constant, irrespective of mental task demand, and therefore an attention mechanism is required to regulate cellular metabolism levels in line with task demands. Increased perceptual load in a task (imposing a greater demand on neural computations) should thus result in increased metabolism underlying attended processing, and reduced metabolism mediating unattended processing. We tested this prediction measuring oxidation states of cytochrome c oxidase (oxCCO), an intracellular marker of cellular metabolism. Broadband near-infrared spectroscopy was used to record oxCCO levels from human visual cortex while participants (both sexes) performed a rapid sequential visual search task under either high perceptual load (complex feature-conjunction search) or low load (feature pop-out search). A task-irrelevant, peripheral checkerboard was presented on a random half of trials. Our findings showed that oxCCO levels in visual cortex regions responsive to the attended-task stimuli were increased in high versus low perceptual load, while oxCCO levels related to unattended processing were significantly reduced. A negative temporal correlation of these load effects further supported our metabolism trade-off account. These results demonstrate an attentional compensation mechanism that regulates cellular metabolism levels according to processing demands. Moreover, they provide novel evidence for the widely-held stipulation that overall cerebral metabolism levels remain constant irrespective of mental task demand and establish a neurophysiological account for capacity limits in perception.Significance StatementWe investigated whether capacity limits in perception can be explained by the effects of attention on the allocation of limited cellular metabolic energy for perceptual processing. We measured the oxidation state of cytochrome c oxidase, an intracellular measure of metabolism, in human visual cortex during task performance. The results showed increased levels of cellular metabolism associated with attended processing and reduced levels of metabolism underlying unattended processing when the task was more demanding. A temporal correlation between these effects supported an attention-directed metabolism trade-off. These findings support an account for inattentional blindness grounded in cellular biochemistry. They also provide novel evidence for the claim that cerebral processing is limited by a constant energy supply, which thus requires attentional regulation.","Bruckmaier, Merit; Tachtsidis, Ilias; Phan, Phong; Lavie, Nilli",J. neurosci,221,26

Among 191 adults (mean age: 47 years;77.5% females), we show that social jetlag, i.e., the mismatch in sleep midpoint between work and free days, was reduced by about 17 min during the pandemic compared with the pre-pandemic state (p &lt;0.001). Concomitantly, respondents’ sleep midpoint was shifted toward morning hours during workdays (p &lt;0.001). A later daily eating midpoint accompanied the shift in sleep timing (p = 0.001).

Meanwhile, low and middle-income countries are dealing with the burden of COVID-19 under worse conditions and handling problems that are partially different, given the peripheral and dependent nature of their economies. For example, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), soon after the onset of the pandemic there was a capital flight of more than USD 100 billion from the emerging economies, a movement that led to the hiring of new debt amounting to USD 77 billion in April and May 2020, of which some USD 25 billion came from emergency IMF loans. During the G20 meeting on March 23, 2020, the World Bank Group (WBG) announced that it would provide a rapid relief package of USD 14 billion, USD 8 billion of which through the International Finance Corporation (IFC). First, the emergency relief package has been channeled through the IFC, the WBG agency that lends to the private sector. Second, the World Bank president stated that the release of financing will depend on counterpart policy measures, such as trade liberalisation and deregulation policies (that promote private health markets, for example). Since the World Bank does not exercise immediate control over national policies, it has to use indirect forms of influence in order to convince and commit governments to perform certain actions. In this dynamic, together with the money, the World Bank offers advice and technical assistance. After all, the World Bank normally cloaks proposals of a political nature with technical arguments. Technical proposals only shape public policies when they are linked to a set of conceptions, interests, and objectives that orient the government's action. That is, technical ideas and proposals do not prevail because they are necessarily superior in professional terms, but because they meet the practical needs of central actors. In conclusion, it is important to consider some key changes in global geopolitics. The last twenty years have witnessed growing competition with the World Bank by new bilateral donors (mainly China) through South-South cooperation, which tends to focus on financing projects and avoids political conditionalities.","Pereira, J.

However, rural areas (despite their low population density) may be especially vulnerable to poor outcomes from COVID-19, owing to limited healthcare infrastructure, long distances to advanced health care, and population characteristics (e.g., high tobacco use, hypertension, obesity, older age). A panel of experts who are actively engaged in treating and managing COVID-19 at a rural academic center was convened to address this topic. In this commentary, we provide readers with some specific issues faced by rural healthcare providers and offer guidance in overcoming these challenges. This guidance includes alternative ventilator strategies, personal protective equipment (PPE), and common therapeutic options.","Sharma, Sunil; Cain, James; Sakhuja, Ankit; Schaefer, Gregory; Krupica, Troy; Sarwari, Arif",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,221,1

This MTase function is associated with the nsp16 protein, which requires a cofactor, nsp10, for its proper activity. Here we show the crystal structure of the nsp10-nsp16 complex bound to the pan-MTase inhibitor sinefungin in the active site. Our structural comparisons reveal low conservation of the MTase catalytic site between Zika and SARS-CoV-2 viruses, but high conservation of the MTase active site between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV viruses; these data suggest that the preparation of MTase inhibitors targeting several coronaviruses - but not flaviviruses - should be feasible. Together, our data add to important information for structure-based drug discovery.","Krafcikova, Petra; Silhan, Jan; Nencka, Radim; Boura, Evzen",Nat Commun,221,10

However, recommendations on how and when to preserve reproductive tissues and cells during a novel severe pandemic are scanty. This paper uses a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis to identify favorable and unfavorable factors and to recognize challenges and obstacles related to the use of cryopreservation procedures during the spreading of a new virus. One of the strengths associated with the cryopreservation is represented by the availability of robust European guidelines on storage safety to prevent sample contamination or cross-contamination by pathogens. These recommendations should be deep-rooted in all ART laboratories. Weaknesses include uncertainties regarding the management of COVID-19 affected asymptomatic patients, the suboptimal accuracy of diagnostic tests for the disease, the nebulous prospective regarding the duration of the pandemic and the additional costs. The application of the strategy represents an opportunity to postpone pregnancy in order to avoid a severe infectious disease during gestation while concomitantly counteracting the possible detrimental effect of time.

SIRT2's catalytic domain has a hydrophobic tunnel where its substrate acyl groups bind. Here, we report that the fluorescent probe 1-aminoanthracene (AMA) binds within SIRT2's hydrophobic tunnel in a substrate-dependent manner. AMA's interaction with SIRT2 was characterized by its enhanced fluorescence upon protein binding (>10-fold). AMA interacted weakly with SIRT2 alone in solution (Kd = 37 µM). However, when SIRT2 was equilibrated with a decanoylated peptide substrate, AMA's affinity for SIRT2 was enhanced â¼10-fold (Kd = 4 µM). The peptide's decanoyl chain and AMA co-occupied SIRT2's hydrophobic tunnel when bound to the protein. In contrast, binding of AMA to SIRT2 was competitive with a myristoylated substrate whose longer acyl chain occluded the entire tunnel. AMA competitively inhibited SIRT2 demyristoylase activity with an IC50 of 21 µM, which was significantly more potent than its inhibition of other deacylase activities. Finally, binding and structural analysis suggests that the AMA binding site in SIRT2's hydrophobic tunnel was structurally stabilized when SIRT2 interacted with a decanoylated or 4-oxononanoylated substrate, but AMA's binding site was less stable when SIRT2 was bound to an acetylated substrate. Our use of AMA to explore changes in SIRT2's hydrophobic tunnel that are induced by interactions with specific acylated substrates has implications for developing ligands that modulate SIRT2's substrate specificity.","Bi, David; Yang, Jie; Hong, Jun Young; Parikh, Prashit; Hinds, Nicole; Infanti, Joseph; Lin, Hening; Weiser, Brian P",Biochemistry,221,24

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and glutathione disulfide (GSH) activity were also thoroughly examined. Autopsied testicular specimens of COVID-19 showed that COVID-19 infection significantly decreased the seminiferous tubule length, interstitial tissue and seminiferous tubule volume, as well as the number of testicular cells. An analysis of the results showed that the Johnsen expressed a reduction in the COVID-19 group when compared to the control group. Our data showed that the expression of ACE2, BAX and Caspase3 were remarkably increased as well as a decrease in the expression of BCL2 in COVID-19 cases. Although, no significant difference was found for TMPRSS2. Furthermore, the results signified an increase in the formation of ROS and suppression of the GSH activity as oxidative stress biomarkers. The results of immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay showed that the expression of ACE2 and the number of apoptotic cells significantly increased in the COVID-19 group. Overall, this study suggests that COVID-19 infection causes spermatogenesis disruption, probably through the oxidative stress pathway and subsequently induces apoptosis.","Moghimi, Negin; Eslami Farsani, Bahram; Ghadipasha, Masoud; Mahmoudiasl, Gholam-Reza; Piryaei, Abbas; Aliaghaei, Abbas; Abdi, Shabnam; Abbaszadeh, Hojjat-Allah; Abdollahifar, Mohammad-Amin; Forozesh, Mehdi",Apoptosis,221,7

Although the epidemiology and pathogenicity of coronaviruses have gained substantial attention, little is known about bovine coronavirus in cattle, which possesses a close relationship with human coronavirus. Bovine torovirus (BToV) is a newly identified relevant pathogen associated with cattle diarrhoea and respiratory diseases, and its epidemiology in the Chinese cattle industry remains unknown. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 461 diarrhoeic faecal samples were collected from 38 different farms in three intensive cattle farming regions and analysed. Our results demonstrated that BToV is present in China, with a low prevalence rate of 1.74% (8/461). The full-length spike genes were further cloned from eight clinical samples (five farms in Henan Province). Phylogenetic analysis showed that two different subclades of BToV strains are circulating in China. Meanwhile, the three BToV strains identified from dairy calves, 18,307, 2YY and 5YY, all contained the amino acid variants R614Q, I801T, N841S and Q885E. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to confirm the presence of BToV in beef and dairy calves in China with diarrhea, which extend our understanding of the epidemiology of BToVs worldwide.","Shi, Zhihai; Wang, Wenjia; Chen, Chaoxi; Zhang, Xiaozhan; Wang, Jing; Xu, Zhaoxue; Lan, Yali",BMC Vet Res,221,5

METHODS: A single-blinded, randomized, and parallel-group study was conducted with 104 dyads of parents and children aged between 36-60 months, recruited in preschools from (blinded). The participants were randomly allocated into control and intervention groups (1:1), stratified by eHealth literacy scores (eHEALS) of parents and caries experience of children. Each 2 weeks, text messages were sent to parents of intervention group via WhatsApp. Visible plaque index (VPI) and the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) were assessed at baseline, 3- and 6-month follow-up, while eHEALS and dietary habits were determined at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Statistical analysis was performed to intra and intergroup comparisons through Fischer´s exact and McNemar tests, and Mann-Whitney U and Friedman tests, respectively (P < 0.05). RESULTS: Despite similarities between groups, intervention increased parental eHEALS scores, influenced the reports about the children's consumption of sugar-free sweets and controlled the severity of ECC. CONCLUSION: Therefore, mobile text messages were effective to control the severity of ECC in low socioeconomic preschoolers, improving parental eHealth literacy and changing children's dietary patterns. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that parental-oriented WhatsApp messages can contribute to oral health education of socioeconomic vulnerable parents towards risk behavior changes to control ECC.","Lotto, Matheus; Strieder, Anna Paola; Ayala Aguirre, Patricia Estefania; de Oliveira, Thais Marchini; de Andrade Moreira Machado, Maria Aparecida; Rios, Daniela; Cruvinel, Thiago",J Dent,221,29

Further, remote electronic exams (E-exams) were considered as mode of assessment. Objectives: This cross-sectional study evaluated the students' experience of remote E-exams during the COVID-19 pandemic among Medical Sciences students in Jordan. Materials and Methods: A survey of 29 questions was prepared on Google forms and distributed among students at Faculties of Medical Sciences (Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Nursing and Applied Medical Sciences) at Jordan University of Science and Technology. The questions include students' demographics, stress experience, and factors contributing to stress as well as behavioral changes related to remote E-exams. Responses were analyzed using descriptive, cross tabulation and Chi-square tests. Results: Among 1019 respondents, 32% reported more stress with remote E-exams. This was associated with academic major and gender. Among students with more stress during remote E-exams, the exam duration, mode of questions navigation and technical problems (exam platform and internet connectivity) appeared as the main factors related to stress in 78%, 76% and >60%, respectively. Other factors include concern regarding the teaching methods, exam environment and students' dishonesty. Remote E-exams had negative impact on students' dietary habits (increase consumption of caffeine and high energy drinks, high sugar food, fast food), sleep (reduction in sleeping hours, more consumption of insomnia medications), physical activity (less exercises) and smoking habits (increase). Conclusion: Results suggested a negative impact of E-exams on students within Medical Faculties. Robust exam platform and remote mock E-exams are recommended to reduce students' potential stress. A stress-free environment is very essential to encourage students to adopt remote E-exams, particularly if the pandemic will take longer. Various awareness programs about students' habits related to dietary, sleep quality, physical activity and smoking are highly valuable for students' health benefits. This is of particular importance since the current students at Faculties of Medical Sciences are the future health care providers.","Elsalem, Lina; Al-Azzam, Nosayba; Jum039,; ah, Ahmad A; Obeidat, Nail; Sindiani, Amer Mahmoud; Kheirallah, Khalid A",Ann Med Surg (Lond),221,16

NLI is one of the best scenarios to test these architectures, due to the knowledge required to understand complex sentences and established relationships between a hypothesis and a premise. Nevertheless, these models suffer from incapacity to generalise to other domains or difficulties to face multilingual and interlingual scenarios. The leading pathway in the literature to address these issues involve designing and training extremely large architectures, which leads to unpredictable behaviours and to establish barriers which impede broad access and fine tuning. In this paper, we propose a new architecture called Siamese Inter-Lingual Transformer (SILT), to efficiently align multilingual embeddings for Natural Language Inference, allowing for unmatched language pairs to be processed.

Within this context, a prospective observational study was conducted to estimate the prevalence and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in different categories of workers and factors associated with positivity, through the detection of virus-specific immunoglobulin G and M (IgG/IgM) in serum samples. Enrollees were divided in low exposure and medium-high groups on the basis of their work activity. Antibody responders were re-contacted after 3 months for the follow-up. Of 2255 sampled workers, 4.8% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies, with 81.7% to IgG only. Workers who continued to go to their place of work, were healthcare workers, or experienced at least one COVID-19-related symptom were more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies prevalence was significantly higher in the medium-high risk vs. low-risk group (7.2% vs. 3.0%, p < 0.0001). At 3-month follow-up, 81.3% of subjects still had antibody response. This study provided important information of SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence among workers in northern Italy, where the impact of COVID-19 was particularly intense. The presented surveillance data give a contribution to refine current estimates of the disease burden expected from the SARS-CoV-2.","Della Valle, Paola; Fabbri, Marco; Madotto, Fabiana; Ferrara, Pietro; Cozzolino, Paolo; Calabretto, Elisabetta; D039,; Orso, Marco Italo; Longhi, Ermanno; Polosa, Riccardo; Riva, Michele Augusto; Mazzaglia, Giampiero; Sommese, Carmen; Mantovani, Lorenzo Giovanni",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),221,1

These viruses possess highly conserved viral macro domain A1pp having adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose binding and phosphatase activity sites. A1pp inhibits adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation in the host and promotes viral infection and pathogenesis. We performed in silico screening of FDA approved drugs and nucleoside analogue library against the recently reported crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 A1pp domain. Docking scores and interaction profile analyses exhibited strong binding affinity of eleven FDA approved drugs and five nucleoside analogues NA1 (-13.84), nadide (-13.65), citicholine (-13.54), NA2 (-12.42), and NA3 (-12.27). The lead compound NA1 exhibited significant hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction at the natural substrate binding site. The root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), solvent accessible surface (SASA), hydrogen bond formation, principle component analysis, and free energy landscape calculations for NA1 bound protein displayed stable complex formation in 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation, compared to unbound macro domain and natural substrate adenosine-5-diphosphoribose bound macro domain that served as a positive control. The molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area analysis of NA1 demonstrated binding free energy of -175.978 ± 0.401 kJ/mol in comparison to natural substrate which had binding free energy of -133.403 ± 14.103 kJ/mol. In silico analysis by modelling tool ADMET and prediction of biological activity of these compounds further validated them as putative therapeutic molecules against SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, this study offers NA1 as a lead SARS-CoV-2 A1pp domain inhibitor for future testing and development as therapeutics against human coronavirus.","Singh, Atul Kumar; Kushwaha, Prem Prakash; Prajapati, Kumari Sunita; Shuaib, Mohd; Gupta, Sanjay; Kumar, Shashank",Comput Biol Med,221,6

Lung protective ventilation strategies are recommended in order to minimize ventilator induced lung injury. Whether patients with COVID-19 have the same risk for complications including barotrauma is still unknown. Therefore, we investigated barotrauma in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring prolonged MV. METHODS: All patients meeting diagnosis criteria for ARDS according to the Berlin Definition, with PCR positive SARS-CoV2 infection and prolonged mechanical ventilation, defined as &#8805;2 days, treated at our ARDS referral center between March and April 2020 were included in a retrospective registry analysis. Complications were detected by manual review of all patient data including respiratory data, imaging studies, and patient files. RESULTS: A total of 20 patients with severe COVID-19 pulmonary failure (Overall characteristics: median age: 61 years, female gender 6, median duration of MV 22 days) were analyzed. Eight patients (40%) developed severe barotrauma during MV (after median 18 days, range: 1-32) including pneumothorax (5/20), pneumomediastinum (5/20), pneumopericard (1/20), and extended subcutaneous emphysema (5/20). Median respirator settings 24 hours before barotrauma were: Peak inspiratory pressure (Ppeak) 29 cm H2O (range: 27-35), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 14 cm H2O (range: 5-24), tidal volume (VT) 5.4ml/kg predicted body weight (range 0.4-8.6), plateau pressure (Pplateau) 27 cm H2O (range: 19-30). Mechanical ventilation was significantly more invasive on several occasions in patients without barotrauma. CONCLUSION: Barotrauma in COVID-19 induced respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation was found in 40% of patients included in this registry. Our data suggest that barotrauma in COVID-19 may occur even when following recommendations for lung protective MV.","Udi, Josefina; Lang, Corinna N; Zotzmann, Viviane; Krueger, Kirsten; Fluegler, Annabelle; Bamberg, Fabian; Bode, Christoph; Duerschmied, Daniel; Wengenmayer, Tobias; Staudacher, Dawid L",J Intensive Care Med,221,1

We aimed to highlight differences among suicide completers before and after the onset of Greece's serious debt crisis of 2010 based exclusively on forensic data. The sample's size permitted a further elaboration by means of a time series analysis too. Data were collected from the Piraeus Department of Forensic Medicine for the period 1992-2016. We extracted information on sociodemographic parameters, psychiatric medication and alcohol intake, suicide method, place and month of suicide. The ""after crisis onset"" group (2011-2016) was significantly older (p = 0.039)-primarily due to differences in the 55-64 age group-, had more frequently used psychiatric medications (p < 0.001), less often alcohol (p = 0.001) and died more frequently by immolation (p = 0.001). These differences were-almost exclusively-due to changes regarding male suicidal behavior. Time series analysis indicates that no strong increasing trend in total (male + female) suicide count can be observed, despite a local increase in 2009-2010. Antidepressant-positive suicides show an increase after 2010, whereas alcohol-positive suicides show a decrease. Future predicted forecasts for antidepressant-positive suicides indicate a decrease (from 5.6 per year in 2018 to 4.3 per year in 2025) whereas an increase is predicted in alcohol-positive suicides (7.7 per year in 2017, 9.36 per year in 2025). Middle-aged men, compared to middle-aged women, presumably found it harder to adjust to economic hardship after the crisis onset. Finally, comparatively more men than women who died by suicide appear to have started and/or complied with psychiatric treatment after 2010.","Paraschakis, Antonios; Karageorgiou, Vasilios; Efstathiou, Vasiliki; Douzenis, Athanassios; Boyokas, Ilias; Michopoulos, Ioannis",Soc. psychiatr. psychiatr. epidemiol,221,1

The aim of this study was to correlate the 25OH-Vitamin D serum concentrations with clinical parameters of lung involvement, in elderly patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Sixty-five consecutive COVID-19 patients (mean age 76 ± 13 years) and sixty-five sex- and age-matched control subjects (CNT) were analyzed. The following clinical parameters, including comorbidities, were collected at admission: type of pulmonary involvement, respiratory parameters (PaO2, SO2, PaCO2, PaO2/FiO2), laboratory parameters (including 25OH-vitamin D, D-dimer, C-reactive protein). Results: Significantly lower vitamin D serum levels were found in COVID-19 patients than in CNT (median 7.9 vs 16.3 ng/mL, p = 0.001). Interestingly, a statistically significant positive correlation was observed between vitamin D serum levels and PaO2 (p = 0.03), SO2 (p = 0.05), PaO2/FiO2 (p = 0.02), while a statistically significant negative correlation was found between vitamin D serum levels and D-dimer (p = 0.04), C-reactive protein (p = 0.04) and percentage of O2 in a venturi mask (p = 0.04). A negative correlation was also observed between vitamin D serum levels and severity of radiologic pulmonary involvement, evaluated by computed tomography: in particular, vitamin D was found significantly lower in COVID-19 patients with either multiple lung consolidations (p = 0.0001) or diffuse/severe interstitial lung involvement than in those with mild involvement (p = 0.05). Finally, significantly lower vitamin D serum levels were found in the elderly COVID-19 patients who died during hospitalization, compared to those who survived (median 3.0 vs 8.4 ng/mL, p = 0.046). Conclusions: This study confirms that 25OH-vitamin D serum deficiency is associated with more severe lung involvement, longer disease duration and risk of death, in elderly COVID-19 patients. The detection of low vitamin D levels also in younger COVID-19 patients with less comorbidities further suggests vitamin D deficiency as crucial risk factor at any age.","Sulli, Alberto; Gotelli, Emanuele; Casabella, Andrea; Paolino, Sabrina; Pizzorni, Carmen; Alessandri, Elisa; Grosso, Marco; Ferone, Diego; Smith, Vanessa; Cutolo, Maurizio",Nutrients,221,1

METHODS: After critical appraisal of the literature, studies were selected with particular attention being paid to meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and large prospective cohort studies. For each item of the perioperative treatment pathway, available English literature was examined and reviewed. RESULTS: Patients should be permitted to drink clear fluids up to 2 h before anaesthesia and surgery. Oral carbohydrate loading should be used routinely. All patients may have an individualized plan for fluid and haemodynamic management that matches the monitoring needs with patient and surgical risk. Minimizing the side effects of anaesthetics and analgesics using short-acting drugs with careful perioperative monitoring should be encouraged. Protective ventilation with alveolar recruitment maneuvers is required. Preventive use of a combination with 2-3 antiemetics in addition to propofol-based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) is most likely to reduce PONV. While the ideal analgesia regimen remains to be determined, it is clear that a multimodal opioid-sparing analgesic strategy has significant benefits. CONCLUSION: Careful evaluation of single patient and planning of the anesthetic care are mandatory to join the ERAS philosophy. Optimal fluid management, use of short-acting drugs, prevention of PONV, protective ventilation, and multimodal analgesia are the cornerstones of the anaesthesia management within ERAS protocols.","Pignot, Géraldine; Brun, Clément; Tourret, Maxime; Lannes, François; Fakhfakh, Sami; Rybikowski, Stanislas; Maubon, Thomas; Picini, Marion; Walz, Jochen",World j. urol,221,20

Even though the disease is often portrayed by its most apparent clinical features, given the abundance of GH receptors throughout the body, it truly is a systemic disease leading to numerous complications and comorbidities. A distinct medical issue in the context of acromegaly is diabetes: It can be a complication as a consequence of GH excess and its mediators, but it can also result from treatment of acromegaly. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of the effects of acromegaly pathophysiology on glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, it devotes an extensive section on the influence that acromegaly treatment has on glucose metabolism, including approved as well as currently investigated drugs. It also summarizes observations from the use of anti-diabetic medication in patients with acromegaly. EXPERT OPINION: Glucose imbalance is an important aspect of acromegaly comorbidity and deserves more attention. Even though numerous studies have investigated glucose homeostasis in acromegaly, there is still a clear need for more basic, translational, and also clinical research to advance the understanding of the underlying mechanisms and how to best address them.","Störmann, Sylvère; Schopohl, Jochen",Expert Opin Pharmacother,221,16

Methods: To assess coverage of wildlife and other environmental aspects, we reviewed major health security reports (including World Organisation for Animal Health Performance of Veterinary Services reports, and World Health Organization Joint External Evaluations and follow-on National Action Plans for Health Security) published by 107 countries and territories. We extracted information on stated coverage gaps, wildlife surveillance systems and priority diseases. We also searched National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans published by 125 countries to assess whether disease surveillance or prevention activities were included. Findings: We noted that the occurrence frequency of keywords indicative of wildlife, environment, biodiversity and climate factors varied with type of report and between countries. We found that more than half (57.9%, 62/107) of the reporting countries did not provide any evidence of a functional wildlife health surveillance programme. Most countries (83.2%, 89/107) indicated specific gaps in operations, coordination, scope or capacity. Only eight of the 125 countries (6.4%) publishing a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan reported tangible activities related to wildlife health or zoonotic disease.

SARS-CoV-2 binds its host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), through the viral spike (S) protein. The mortality related to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure in COVID-19 patients has been suggested to be connected with cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), an excessive immune response that severely damages healthy lung tissue. In addition, cardiac symptoms, including fulminant myocarditis, are frequent in patients in a severe state of illness. Diacerein (DAR) is an anthraquinone derivative drug whose active metabolite is rhein. Different studies have shown that this compound inhibits the IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, TNF-&#945;, NF-&#954;B and NALP3 inflammasome pathways. The antiviral activity of rhein has also been documented. This metabolite prevents hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and influenza A virus (IAV) adsorption and replication through mechanisms involving regulation of oxidative stress and alterations of the TLR4, Akt, MAPK, and NF-&#954;B signalling pathways. Importantly, rhein inhibits the interaction between the SARS-CoV S protein and ACE2 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting rhein as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of SARS-CoV infection. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that DAR is a multi-target drug useful for COVID-19 treatment. This anthraquinone may control hyperinflammatory conditions by multi-faceted cytokine inhibition and by reducing viral infection.","de Oliveira, Pedro Gonçalves; Termini, Lara; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Lepique, Ana Paula; Sposito, Andrei C; Boccardo, Enrique",Med Hypotheses,221,20

In this introduction, I suggest that the place of the ethical in phenomenology implies a certain paradoxical logic of expression, and I consider the relationship between expression and encroachment.

A major challenge of RNAi therapeutics is the endosomal entrapment of the delivered siRNA. In this study, we developed a family of delivery vehicles called Janus base nanopieces (NPs). They are rod-shaped nanoparticles formed by bundles of Janus base nanotubes (JBNTs) with RNA cargoes incorporated inside via charge interactions. JBNTs are formed by noncovalent interactions of small molecules consisting of a base component mimicking DNA bases and an amino acid side chain. NPs presented many advantages over conventional delivery materials. NPs efficiently entered cells via macropinocytosis similar to lipid nanoparticles while presenting much better endosomal escape ability than lipid nanoparticles; NPs escaped from endosomes via a ""proton sponge"" effect similar to cationic polymers while presenting significant lower cytotoxicity compared to polymers and lipids due to their noncovalent structures and DNA-mimicking chemistry. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we have shown that NPs are promising candidates for antiviral delivery applications, which may be used for conditions such as COVID-19 in the future.","Lee, Jinhyung; Sands, Ian; Zhang, Wuxia; Zhou, Libo; Chen, Yupeng",Proc.

At the time of writing this article, more than 17,500 elderly people that lived in Care Homes have died due to coronavirus, more than 66% of the deaths. The infection and mortality rates in the institutionalised population are high. This is due to the advanced age, immune system deficit, and the presence of comorbidities, as well as because there are frail, because they live with other residents and carers in a closed institution, and transmission is easy in the context of a highly contagious and virulent virus. The elderly often have more severe forms of the disease. Atypical presentations are more frequent in the elderly and can delay the diagnosis. The Polymer Chain Reaction (PCR) test in the first 7 days for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA is considered the test of reference ('Gold standard'). The criteria for referring to a hospital site from Care Homes should take into account an assessment of comorbidity, the severity, the presence of severe cognitive impairment, and the dependency or necessity of ventilatory support in seriously ill patients. The social-health centres should have contingency plans available in order to offer a response when cases of COVID-19 appear. Isolation during pandemics may have important physical and psychosocial consequences in the residents.

Majority of these scores were devised in western countries and their cross-cultural compatibilities are rarely demonstrated. The World Health Organisation quality of life (WHO QOL-BREF) questionnaire with 4 domains, is one of the best known multilingual instruments for such assessment. Its reliability has never been demonstrated for THRs and the present study was conceptualised for the same. Methods: THRs done over 6 years were followed up retrospectively. Revision THRs and hemiarthroplasties were excluded. All the cases were done by a single senior arthroplasty surgeon. Clinical examination was done and questionnaires for WHO QOL-BREF and Harris Hip scores were given to the patients. Results: The number of patients included in the study was 96 with 115 operated hips. The average age of these patients was 41.40 years ranging from 17 to 80 years. There was strong male preponderance in our series of patients with 90 THRs. The mean score of domain 1 was 70.8 (SD 21.6), domain 2: 72.4 (SD 18.8), domain 3: 74.7 (SD 16.8) and domain 4: 75.4 (SD 14.8); showed significant functional improvement post THR in domain 2 (P = 0.0001), domain 3 (P = 0.0010) and domain 4(P = 0.0001), when compared to scores of general healthy population. Similarly, the scores were significantly improved in all domains as compared to cohorts of post-operative acetabular and hip fractures. The score was found to be a reliable tool with Cronbach's alpha of 0.912 and strong correlation was present with the standard Harris hip scores (p = 0.000). Conclusion: WHO QOL-BREF is a potent tool to assess the quality of life in patients undergoing THRs. It can be used as a single index of measurement and it is simple, reproducible and reliable.","Kumar, Prasoon; Sen, Ramesh Kumar; Aggarwal, Sameer; Jindal, Karan; Rajnish, Rajesh Kumar",,221,16

As a consequence, several protective measures were urged by national governments in order to limit the spread of the pandemic. Drawing on the literature on health behaviours, in the present study, we investigated the psychological factors (i.e., attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioural control, intentions, and risk perception) that were associated with two highly recommended behaviours: frequent hand washing and social distancing (i.e., staying at home except for essential reasons). The study employed a correlational design with a follow-up. A questionnaire including measures of psychological predictors was administered via social media to a sample of 403 adults residing in Italy during the lockdown. Self-reported behaviours were assessed one week later. Findings showed that attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioural control were significantly related to hand washing and social distancing through intentions. Risk perception was a significant predictor of social distancing but not of hand washing. These findings suggest that intervention and communication strategies aimed at encouraging preventive measures during the Covid-19 pandemic should be organized taking into account multiple factors which partially differ depending on the type of behaviour considered.

This is because the construction of public discourse on inequality and inclusion is necessarily a political and social process, with social policy implications. Public discourse not only reflects the political ideals and moral standards of the nation at a given time, but also impacts the vested interests of different social groups, and their acquisition and maintenance of power.

The aim of this paper is to present the results of a systematic scientific literature search performed on papers published from April 1st to April 30th, 2020. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, PEDro, Web of Science and the main international guideline databases for articles published (including Epub), in English, from April 1st to April 30th, 2020. Papers were included if they reported on one of the following: 1) prevalence and features of the emerging disability after COVID-19; 2) rehabilitation strategies applied for COVID-19 patients, regardless of setting or stage; 3) information about rehabilitation services after COVID-19; 4) impact on diseases of rehabilitative interest; 5) complications of rehabilitative interest. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Out of 445 articles retrieved for the time frame, 50 were finally included for qualitative analysis. They consist of seven guidelines, one scoping review, one randomized controlled trial, four descriptive studies (qualitative), one case series, one case report, and 35 expert opinions. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic rapid living review showed an increasing evidence on rehabilitation needs due to COVID-19 outbreak during April 2020. The main novelties include: 1) the first appearance of epidemiological data on the likely high incidence of neurological complications/disabling sequelae in patients hospitalized for COVID-19; 2) rapid guidelines on the management of chronically disabled patients in the COVID-19 era; 3) advices to provide COVID-19 patients with early respiratory rehabilitation in the acute phase, and with telemonitoring and telerehabilitation in the post-acute phase. Although the overall quality of studies has increased, prospective cohort studies on disability course in COVID-19 pandemic and experimental studies on the effects of rehabilitation are still warranted.","de Sire, Alessandro; Andrenelli, Elisa; Negrini, Francesco; Negrini, Stefano; Ceravolo, Maria G",Eur J Phys Rehabil Med,221,16

However, less is known about how identifying something as an animate agent shapes specific inferences about its internal properties. Here, we test whether preschool children (N = 92; North American population) have specifically biological expectations about animate agents, or if they have more general expectations that animate agents should have an internal source of motion. We presented preschoolers with videos of two puppets: a ""self-propelled"" fur-covered puppet, and a fur-covered puppet that is seen to be moved by a human actor. In addition, we presented preschoolers with images of a familiar artifact (motorcycle) and familiar animal (sheep). For each item, we asked them to choose what they thought was inside each of these entities: nothing, biological insides, or mechanical insides. Preschoolers were less likely to say that a self-propelled fur-covered object was empty, compared to a fur-covered object that was moved by a human actor, which converges with past work with infants. However, preschoolers showed no specifically biological expectations about these objects, despite being able to accurately match biological insides to familiar animals and mechanical insides to familiar artifacts on the follow-up measure. These results suggest that preschoolers do not have specifically biological expectations about animate agents as a category, but rather general expectations that such agents should not be empty inside.","Kominsky, Jonathan F; Shafto, Patrick; Bonawitz, Elizabeth",PLoS One,221,31

Transplant recipients are vulnerable due to comorbidities and immunosuppressants that render them susceptible to infections. The information on COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients remains limited to small case series. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted, and 12 case series totalling 204 kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 were identified. Data were extracted, pooled and analysed. RESULTS: Most patients (74%) were men. The most frequent symptoms were fever (76%), cough (64%) and dyspnoea (43%). At admission, over 70% of the patients had abnormal radiological findings. Leukocyte counts were in the lower normal range. C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer were consistently increased. Treatments included lowering immunosuppression, hydroxychloroquine, antivirals, tocilizumab and intravenous immunoglobulins. Thirty-one percent of the patients were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), and 16% required intubation. The overall mortality was 21.2%. Patients who died were significantly older than those who survived (61 ± 12 vs. 51 ± 15, p < .01). Logistic regression revealed that the odds for death increased by 4.3% for each additional year of age (odds ratio [OR] 1.043, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.005-1.083, p value = .0265). CONCLUSIONS: No substantial conclusions could be drawn on the efficacy of any particular treatment.

METHODS: A Multicentric prospective national registry was carried out. 47 Spanish PICUs participated in the study. Features from children admitted to PICUs with confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection or fulfilling multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C) criteria were collected. RESULTS: 74 patients were included in the registry. 61% of them presented with MIS-C features. Patients not presenting with MIS-C features presented more frequently with respiratory distress (60.7% vs 13.3%, p&lt;0.001) and less frequently with shock (13.8% vs 84.4%, p&lt;0.001) or cardiac dysfunction (10.3% vs 53.3%, p=0.001) and usually had previous health conditions (48.3% vs 11.8%, p=0.005) and were younger ((3.4 years (IQR 0.4-9.4) vs. 9.4 years (IQR 5.5-11.8), p=0.002). Three patients included in the registry died, they all had previous health conditions and none presented with MIS-C features. The group presenting with MIS-C had lower mortality (0% vs 10.3%, p=0.056) and needed less frequently invasive ventilation (13.3% vs 41.4% p=0.005) than patients not presenting with MIS-C. CONCLUSIONS: Although SARS-COV-2 severe infection is much more infrequent in children than in adults, some children present with severe disease requiring PICU admission. In Spain, MIS-C was the most frequent presentation. The course in this group of patients is usually more favorable compared to those patients without MIS-C.","González, R.; García-Salido, A.; De Carlos Vicente, J.; Belda Hofheinz, S.; Balcells Ramírez, J.; Slocker, M.",Pediatric Critical Care Medicine,221,1

Some experts report that the virus may have reduced toxicity during transmission, but others say that toxicity does not change during transmission. CASE REPORT In this case series, we report clinical and imaging characteristics of 3 patients (A, B, and C) infected with COVID-19. In an exposure-tracking epidemiological investigation, we found that it is possible that Patient A transmitted the infection to her treating physician, Patient B. Patient B then likely transmitted the infection to her family member, Patient C. From the chest CT studies and clinical characteristics, we postulate that the virulence did not decrease during human-to-human transmission. In previous studies, patients with the virus infection had changes in chest CT; however, we found that during the early stages of this disease, some patients (Patient C) may have normal chest CT scans and laboratory studies. Most importantly, we found that IL-6 levels were highest and lymphocyte count was lowest in those with more severe infection. CONCLUSIONS In this case series, we report the exposure relationship of the 3 patients and found that chest CT scans may not have any changes at the beginning of this disease. Lymphopenia and elevated levels of IL-6 can be found after infection.","Huang, Jing; Li, Jie; Zou, Zhenwei; Kandathil, Asha; Liu, Jun; Qiu, Shaohong; Oz, Orhan K",Am J Case Rep,221,16

The precise origin and subsequent path of transmission have not yet been established-but like the other novel coronaviruses that it closely resembles, it appears to have evolved naturally in a bat host. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), ranges from asymptomatic, to mild self-limited illness, to progressive pneumonia, respiratory compromise, multiorgan failure, and death. In addition, a hyperinflammatory disease state occurs in a subset of patients, and may be seen either during acute infection or following recovery. The search for effective pharmacological management of COVID-19 continues, but several promising candidates have been identified, including the viral nucleoside analog remdesivir. However, despite the existence of literally thousands of clinical trials, the management of COVID-19 remains challenging, and the development of an optimal, evidence-based therapeutic approach is ongoing. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 on the biobanking world is evolving and profound-in particular, it is likely that many of mysteries surrounding COVID-19 will be solved via the availability of high-quality, large-scale collection, storage, and analysis of patient specimens. The purpose of this review article is therefore to provide a rapid, comprehensive, and relevant overview and primer on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, with attention to the epidemiology, virology, transmission, clinical features, and major therapeutic options currently existent.","Knight, Tristan E",Biopreserv. biobank.

This review describes the properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and highlights not only their anti-viral effects but also their important immune-modulatory properties and their well-known use in autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus and arthritis. Chloroquine appears to inhibit in vitro SARS virus' replication and to interfere with SARS-CoV2 receptor (ACE2). Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine impede lysosomal activity and autophagy, leading to a decrease of antigen processing and presentation. They are also known to interfere with endosomal Toll-like receptors signaling and cytosolic sensors of nucleic acids, which result in a decreased cellular activation and thereby a lower type I interferons and inflammatory cytokine secretion. Given the antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, there is a rational to use them against SARS-CoV2 infection. However, the anti-interferon properties of these molecules might be detrimental, and impaired host immune responses against the virus. This duality could explain the discrepancy with the recently published studies on CQ/HCQ treatment efficacy in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, although these treatments could be an interesting potential strategy to limit progression toward uncontrolled inflammation, they do not appear per se sufficiently potent to control the whole inflammatory process in COVID-19, and more targeted and/or potent therapies should be required at least in add-on.","Gies, Vincent; Bekaddour, Nassima; Dieudonné, Yannick; Guffroy, Aurélien; Frenger, Quentin; Gros, Frédéric; Rodero, Mathieu Paul; Herbeuval, Jean-Philippe; Korganow, Anne-Sophie",Front Immunol,221,16

In the present work, the strategies used by shrimps to cope with temperature and dissolved oxygen fluctuations during 24 days were investigated through the evaluation of oxygen consumption and heat shock proteins (HSP) gene expression. During daily fluctuations, no change in oxygen consumption in the short-term, but a significant increase in the long-term during hyperthermia conditions was registered, whereas a significant decrease during hypoxia was observed during all the bioassay. On the other hand, HSP70 and HSP90 gene expression increased in gills under thermal stress but was down-regulated under hypoxia, in both the short- and the long-term. This study highlights that to counteract environmental variations of temperature and dissolved oxygen, the shrimps use molecular compensatory mechanisms (HSP gene expression) that are different to those used under constant hypoxic conditions, suggesting that hypoxia can compromise physiological cytoprotection.","Ulaje, Sergio Alan; Lluch-Cota, Salvador E; Sicard, María Teresa; Ascencio, Felipe; Cruz-Hernández, Pedro; Racotta, Ilie S; Rojo-Arreola, Liliana",J Therm Biol,221,28

SAPDMA is a cationic surfactant that is used mostly in cosmetics, conditioning agents and has recently gained attention as a corrosion inhibitor in the sea pipelines industry. In this regard, literature concerning the ecotoxicological classification of SAPDMA on aquatic animals is lacking. This study aims to evaluate the potential ecotoxicity of SAPDMA using the aquatic zebrafish embryo model. The potential toxic effects of SAPDMA were assessed by different assays. This includes (i) mortality/survival assay to assess the median lethal concentration (LC50); (ii) teratogenicity assay to assess the no observed effect concentration (NOEC); (iii) organ-specific toxicity assays including cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity (using locomotion assay), hematopoietic toxicity (hemoglobin synthesis using o-dianisidine staining), hepatotoxicity (liver steatosis and yolk retention using Oil Red O (ORO) stain); (iv) cellular cytotoxicity (mitochondrial membrane potential) by measuring the accumulation of JC-1 dye into mitochondria. Exposure of embryos to SAPDMA caused mortality in a dose-dependent manner with a calculated LC50 of 2.3 mg/L. Thus, based on the LC50 value and according to the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Acute Toxicity Rating Scale, SAPDMA is classified as ""moderately toxic"". The No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) concerning a set of parameters including scoliosis, changes in body length, yolk, and eye sizes was 0.1 mg/L. At the same NOEC concentration (0.1 mg/L), no organ-specific toxicity was detected in fish treated with SAPDMA, except hepatomegaly with no associated liver dysfunctions. However, higher SAPDMA concentrations (0.8 mg/L) have dramatic effects on zebrafish organ development (eye, heart, and liver development). Our data recommend a re-evaluation of the SAPDMA employment in the industry setting and its strictly monitoring by environmental and public health agencies.","Al-Jamal, Ola; Al-Jighefee, Hadeel; Younes, Nadin; Abdin, Roba; Al-Asmakh, Maha A; Radwan, A Bahgat; Sliem, Mostafa H; Majdalawieh, Amin F; Pintus, Gianfranco; Yassine, Hadi M; Abdullah, Aboubakr M; Da039,; as, Sahar I; Nasrallah, Gheyath K",Sci Total Environ,221,1

Vitamin D (VitD) can upregulate ACE2 and has an antagonistic effect on Renin, which exerts a vasodilatation and anti-inflammatory effect against coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, it may also facilitate viral entry by increasing ACE2 as the main SARS-CoV-2 receptor and mediates ROS production through NADPH oxidase, as a double-edged sword effect. Lung function and the immune system are also influenced by VitD through several mechanisms, including increased natural antibiotics (Defensin and Cathelicidin) and upregulated transforming growth factor-ß. A higher IgA, Th2/Th1 ratio, and T-regulatory cells are attributable to VitD effects on the immune cells, while these changes may also be a double-edged sword in COVID-19.

There is clearly an urgent need to tackle wildlife trade that is illegal, unsustainable or carries major risks to human health, biodiversity conservation or meeting acceptable animal welfare standards. However, some of the suggested actions in these calls go far beyond tackling these risks and have the potential to undermine human rights, damage conservation incentives and harm sustainable development. There are a number of reasons for this concerns. First calls for bans on wildlife markets often include calls for bans on wet markets, but the two are not the same thing, and wet markets can be a critical underpinning of informal food systems. Second, wildlife trade generates essential resources for the world's most vulnerable people, contributing to food security for millions of people, particularly in developing countries. Third, wildlife trade bans have conservation risks including driving trade underground, making it even harder to regulate, and encouraging further livestock production. Fourth, in many cases, sustainable wildlife trade can provide key incentives for local people to actively protect species and the habitat they depend on, leading to population recoveries. Most importantly, a singular focus on wildlife trade overlooks the key driver of the emergence of infectious diseases: habitat destruction, largely driven by agricultural expansion and deforestation, and industrial livestock production. We suggest that the COVID-19 crisis provides a unique opportunity for a paradigm shift both in our global food system and also in our approach to conservation. We make specific suggestions as to what this entails, but the overriding principle is that local people must be at the heart of such policy shifts.","Roe, Dilys; Dickman, Amy; Kock, Richard; Milner-Gulland, E.

The estimated overall Kappa index was 0.991, reflecting an almost perfect concordance level between the two diagnostic tests. An initial validation test was also performed on 30 nasopharyngeal samples collected in lysis buffer, in which the Lyo-CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit detected 20/21 (95.24%; 95% CI: 76.18-99.88) positive samples and 9/9 (100%; 95% CI: 66.37-100) negative samples. The estimated Kappa index was 0.923, indicating a strong concordance between the test procedures. The Lyo-CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit was suitable for detecting a wide range of RT-qPCR-positive samples (cycle threshold range: 11.45-36.90) and dilutions of heat-inactivated virus (range: 2.5-100 copies/µL); no cross-reaction was observed with the other respiratory pathogens tested. We demonstrated that the performance of the Lyo-CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit was similar to that of commercial RT-qPCR, as the former was highly sensitive and specific, timesaving (1.5 h), inexpensive, and did not require sophisticated equipment. The use of this kit would reduce the time taken for diagnosis and facilitate molecular diagnosis in low-resource laboratories.","Curti, Lucía Ana; Primost, Ivana; Valla, Sofia; Ibañez Alegre, Daiana; Olguin Perglione, Cecilia; Repizo, Guillermo Daniel; Lara, Julia; Parcerisa, Ivana; Palacios, Antonela; Llases, María Eugenia; Rinflerch, Adriana; Barrios, Melanie; Pereyra Bonnet, Federico; Gimenez, Carla Alejandra; Marcone, Débora Natalia",Viruses,221,30

Accordingly, it has stressed health systems worldwide, leading to the cancellation of elective surgical cases and discussions regarding health care resource rationing. It is expected that rationing of surgical resources will continue even after the pandemic peak and may recur with future pandemics, creating a need for a means of triaging patients for emergent and elective spine surgery. METHODS: Using a modified Delphi technique, a cohort of 16 fellowship-trained spine surgeons from 10 academic medical centers constructed a scoring system for the triage and prioritization of emergent and elective spine surgeries. Three separate rounds of videoconferencing and written correspondence were used to reach a final scoring system. Sixteen test cases were used to optimize the scoring system so that it could categorize cases as requiring emergent, urgent, high-priority elective, or low-priority elective scheduling. RESULTS: The devised scoring system included 8 independent components: neurologic status, underlying spine stability, presentation of a high-risk postoperative complication, patient medical comorbidities, expected hospital course, expected discharge disposition, facility resource limitations, and local disease burden. The resultant calculator was deployed as a freely available Web-based calculator (https://jhuspine3.shinyapps.io/SpineUrgencyCalculator/). CONCLUSIONS: We present the first quantitative urgency scoring system for the triage and prioritizing of spine surgery cases in resource-limited settings. We believe that our scoring system, although not all encompassing, has potential value as a guide for triaging spine surgical cases during the COVID pandemic and post-COVID period.","Sciubba, Daniel M; Ehresman, Jeff; Pennington, Zach; Lubelski, Daniel; Feghali, James; Bydon, Ali; Chou, Dean; Elder, Benjamin D; Elsamadicy, Aladine A; Goodwin, C Rory; Goodwin, Matthew L; Harrop, James; Klineberg, Eric O; Laufer, Ilya; Lo, Sheng-Fu L; Neuman, Brian J; Passias, Peter G; Protopsaltis, Themistocles; Shin, John H; Theodore, Nicholas; Witham, Timothy F; Benzel, Edward C",World Neurosurg,221,31

The effect of these measures on patients was unknown. We sought to understand patients' perspectives regarding surgical care during the CoVID-19 pandemic to improve future responses. METHODS: We performed qualitative interviews with patients whose operations were postponed. Interviews explored patient responses to: 1) surgery postponement; 2) experience of surgery; 3) impacts of rescheduling/postponement on emotional/physical health; 4) identifying areas of improvement. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed through an integrated approach. RESULTS: Patient perspectives fell within the following domains: 1) reactions to surgery postponement/rescheduling; 2) experience of surgery during CoVID-19 pandemic; 3) reflections on communication; 4) patient trust in surgeons and healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: We found no patient-reported barriers to rescheduling surgery. Several areas of care which could be improved (communication).

Many countries have enforced 2 - 4 weeks' lockdown and are extending the period depending on their current disease scenario. Most probably the 14-day period of estimated communicability of COVID-19 prompted such decision. But the idea that, if the susceptible population drops below certain threshold, the infection would naturally die out in small communities after a fixed time (following the outbreak), unless the disease is reintroduced from outside, was proposed by Bartlett in 1957. This threshold was termed as Critical Community Size (CCS). Methods: We propose an SEIR model that explains COVID-19 disease dynamics. Using our model, we have calculated country-specific expected time to extinction (TTE) and CCS that would essentially determine the ideal number of lockdown days required and size of quarantined population. Findings: With the given country-wise rates of death, recovery and other parameters, we have identified that, if at a place the total number of susceptible population drops below CCS, infection will cease to exist after a period of TTE days, unless it is introduced from outside. But the disease will almost die out much sooner. We have calculated the country-specific estimate of the ideal number of lockdown days. Thus, smaller lockdown phase is sufficient to contain COVID-19. On a cautionary note, our model indicates another rise in infection almost a year later but on a lesser magnitude.","Das, Sarmistha; Ghosh, Pramit; Sen, Bandana; Mukhopadhyay, Indranil",,221,16

This disease has initially been reported in China and also now it is expeditiously spreading around the globe directly among individuals through coughing and sneezing. Since it is a newly emerging viral disease and obviously there is a lack of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic agents, it is urgently required to develop an effective anti-SARS-CoV-2-agent.Through recent advancements in computational biology and biological assays, several natural compounds and their derivatives have been reported to confirm their target specific antiviral potential against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome(SARS-CoV).These targets including an important host cell receptor, i.e., angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE2 and several viral proteins e.g. spike glycoprotein (S) containing S1 and S2 domains, SARS CoV Chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro), papain-like cysteine protease (PLpro), helicases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Due to physical, chemical, and some genetic similarities of SARS CoV-2 with SARS-COV and MERS-COV, repurposing various anti-SARS-COV or anti-MERS-COV natural therapeutic agents could be helpful for the development of anti-COVID-19 herbal medicine.

Since the onset of infections, several full-length sequences of viral genome have been made available which have been used to gain insights into viral dynamics. We utilised a meta-data driven comparative analysis tool for sequences (Meta-CATS) algorithm to identify mutations in 829 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from around the world. The algorithm predicted sixty-one mutations among SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We observed that most of the mutations were concentrated around three protein coding genes viz nsp3 (non-structural protein 3), RdRp (RNA-directed RNA polymerase) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2. We used various computational tools including normal mode analysis (NMA), C-&#945; discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) and all-atom molecular dynamic simulations (MD) to study the effect of mutations on functionality, stability and flexibility of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins including envelope (E), N and spike (S) proteins. PredictSNP predictor suggested that four mutations (L37H in E, R203K and P344S in N and D614G in S) out of seven were predicted to be neutral whilst the remaining ones (P13L, S197L and G204R in N) were predicted to be deleterious in nature thereby impacting protein functionality. NMA, C-&#945; DMD and all-atom MD suggested some mutations to have stabilizing roles (P13L, S197L and R203K in N protein) where remaining ones were predicted to destabilize mutant protein. In summary, we identified significant mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes as well as used computational approaches to further characterize the possible effect of highly significant mutations on SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The open source community mobilised solutions to combat this using 3D printing technology. One such solution was the face shield, which protects facial areas from droplet contamination when used by orthopaedic and other front line health care workers (HCWs). Objectives: To assess the efficacy of an in-house developed face shield based on feedback by HCWs and its usage in triaging zones and operation theatre in a tertiary care hospital. Methods: A protective face shield was developed and distributed among the orthopaedic surgeons and front line HCWs involved in the ICU in our hospital and neighbouring facilities. Feedback was obtained using a questionnaire utilising a Likert scale. Results: 227 face shields were distributed to the HCWs in our hospital (157) and neighbouring facilities (70). Design modifications were done as per the needs of the HCWs. 37 HCWs provided feedback giving the face shields an overall mean score of 7.92 out of 10. The poly vinyl chloride (PVC) film visors were better for airway management procedures as it can be tucked into PPE suit and visors with overhead projector (OHP) sheets were suitable for ICU and operative procedures. Conclusion: A locally developed face shield design by an inter disciplinary team in synchrony with HCWs is found to increase its acceptability and efficacy. Face shields can be made more effective in different triaging and treatment situations by varying the device setup.","Chaturvedi, Satyam; Gupta, Amartya; Krishnan S, Vimal; Bhat, Anil K.",J.

Our current study employed single-particle cryoelectron microscopy to visualize multiple states of open and closed conformations of S protein at physiological pH 7.4 and near-physiological pH 6.5 and pH 8.0. Propensities of open and closed conformations were found to differ with pH changes, whereby around 68% of S protein exists in open conformation at pH 7.4. Furthermore, we noticed a continuous movement in the N-terminal domain, receptor-binding domain (RBD), S2 domain, and stalk domain of S protein conformations at various pH values. Several key residues involving RBD-neutralizing epitopes are differentially exposed in each conformation.

An increasingly worrying aspect is the gap between the exponential disease spread and the delay in adopting preventive measures. This gap is attributed to the lack of awareness about the disease and its preventive measures. Nowadays, social media platforms (ie., Twitter) are frequently used to create awareness about major events, including COVID-19. In this paper, we use Twitter to characterize public awareness regarding COVID-19 by analyzing the information flow in the most affected countries. Towards that, we collect more than 46K trends and 622 Million tweets from the top twenty most affected countries to examine 1) the temporal evolution of COVID-19 related trends, 2) the volume of tweets and recurring topics in those trends, and 3) the user sentiment towards preventive measures. Our results show that countries with a lower pandemic spread generated a higher volume of trends and tweets to expedite the information flow and contribute to public awareness. We also observed that in those countries, the COVID-19 related trends were generated before the sharp increase in the number of cases, indicating a preemptive attempt to notify users about the potential threat. Finally, we noticed that in countries with a lower spread, users had a positive sentiment towards COVID-19 preventive measures.

By mid-March 2021, the COVID-19 almost hit all countries worldwide, with about 122 and 2.7 million confirmed cases and deaths, respectively. As a strong measure to stop the infection spread and deaths, many countries have enforced quarantine and lockdown of many activities. The shutdown of these activities has resulted in large economic losses. However, it has been widely reported that these measures have resulted in improved air quality, more specifically in highly polluted areas characterized by massive population and industrial activities. The reduced levels of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and particulate matter emissions have been reported and confirmed worldwide in association with lockdown periods. On the other hand, ozone levels in ambient air have been found to increase, mainly in response to the reduced nitrogen emissions. In addition, improved water quality in natural water resources has been reported as well.

METHODS: This study was exempted from review by institutional review board waiver. A flexible fiberoptic endoscopy was placed through stellate openings in the standard face shield and the enhanced face shield. A series of simulated coughs were created with bursts of fluorescein dye through an atomizer tip placed within the test participant's mouth. Ultraviolet lighting illuminated the test area, and areas of dye splatter were noted. RESULTS: Fluorescein dye is easily aerosolized along the lateral inferior aspect of a standard shield with significant contamination of the surrounds. The enhanced face shield maintained a barrier to the aerosolized dye. DISCUSSION: Face shields, rather than face masks, should be considered a preferred alternative for the public and for health care professionals alike, as they address many of the personal protective equipment concerns especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Otolaryngologists are at high risk from aerosol-generating procedures, such as flexible fiberoptic endoscopy, even when wearing personal protective equipment. Here we describe a uniquely designed face shield to be worn by the patient as another layer of protection for the environment and for medical personnel. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: During the course of a flexible fiberoptic endoscopy, medical personnel are safely isolated from potential infectious particles with a newly designed face shield.","Anon, Jack B; Denne, Carter; Rees, Darcy",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,221,1

The disease is known for almost 100 years, an effective vaccine or treatment is still unavailable, only proper biosecurity measures, including disinfection, are being applied, in order to prevent disease outbreaks. Eight active substances, i.e., formaldehyde, sodium hypochlorite, caustic soda, glutaraldehyde, phenol, benzalkonium chloride, potassium peroxymonosulfate and acetic acid, were tested, in order to confirm their effectiveness against African swine fever virus (ASFV). This specific selection was done based on the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)'s recommendation and previous disinfectant studies on surfaces. The result of our study shows that most of them inactivate the virus, in recommended concentrations. In order to reduce the cytotoxicity of the four substances, Microspin S-400 HR columns were applied, therefore making it possible to demonstrate four logarithms virus titer reduction. Sodium hypochlorite, glutaraldehyde, caustic soda and potassium peroxymonosulfate showed the best ASFV inactivation rates, achieving titer reductions over 5 logs. Despite microfiltration, the virucidal activity of formaldehyde was not assessable, due to its high cytotoxicity.

The aim was to describe a multidisciplinary cohort of patients with AI/IMID and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a single tertiary center and analyze sociodemographic, clinical, and therapeutic factors associated with poor outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted from the 1st of March until May 29th, 2020 in a University tertiary hospital in Barcelona, Spain. Patients with an underlying AI/IMID and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified in our local SARS-CoV-2 infection database. Controls (2:1) were selected from the same database and matched by age and gender. The primary outcome was severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was a composite endpoint including admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation (MV), and/or death. Several covariates including age, sex, and comorbidities among others were combined into a multivariate model having severe SARS-CoV-2 as the dependent variable. Also, a sensitivity analysis was performed evaluating AID and IMID separately. RESULTS: The prevalence of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of AI/IMID patients was 1.3%. Eighty-five patients with AI/IMID and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were identified, requiring hospitalization in 58 (68%) cases. A total of 175 patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 (58 with AI/IMID and 117 matched-controls) were analyzed. In logistic regression analysis, a significant inverse association between AI/IMID group and severe SARS-CoV-2 (OR 0.28; 95% CI 0.12-0.61; p = 0.001), need of MV (OR 0.20; IC 95% 0.05-0.71; p = 0.014), and ICU admission (OR 0.25; IC 95% 0.10-0.62; p = 0.003) was found. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AI/IMID who require admission for SARS-CoV-2 infection have a lower risk of developing severe disease, including the need to stay in the ICU and MV.","Sarmiento-Monroy, Juan C; Espinosa, Gerard; Londoño, Maria-Carlota; Meira, Fernanda; Caballol, Berta; Llufriu, Sara; Carrasco, Josep Lluis; Moll-Udina, Aina; Quintana, Luis F; Giavedoni, Priscila; Ramírez, Julio; Inciarte-Mundo, Jose; Solana, Elisabeth; Blanco, Yolanda; Martinez-Hernandez, Eugenia; Sepúlveda, Maria; Llorenç, Victor; Prieto-González, Sergio; Espígol-Frigolé, Georgina; Milisenda, Jose C; Cid, Maria C; Mascaró, Jose M; Blanco, Isabel; Barberá, Joan Albert; Sibila, Oriol; Gratacos-Ginès, Jordi; Adán, Alfredo; Agustí, Alvaro; Sanmartí, Raimon; Panés, Julian; Cervera, Ricard; Vila, Jordi; Soriano, Alex; Gómez-Puerta, José A",J Autoimmun,221,1

Our analyses suggest that the pressing need to restart socioeconomic activities could lead to new pandemic waves, and that substantial control efforts prove necessary throughout 2021. Using knowledge on control measures introduced in 2020, we anticipate that relaxing measures completely or to the extent as in autumn 2020 could launch a wave starting in April 2021. Additional waves could be prevented altogether if measures are relaxed as in summer 2020 or in a step-wise manner throughout 2021.

Many Asian countries are starting to vaccinate frontline workers; however, expedited vaccine development has led to hesitancy among the general population. We evaluated the willingness of healthcare workers to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: From 12 to 21 December 2020, we recruited 1720 healthcare workers from 6 countries: China, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam and Bhutan. The self-administrated survey collected information on willingness to vaccinate, perception of COVID-19, vaccine concerns, COVID-19 risk profile, stigma, pro-socialness scale, and trust in health authorities. RESULTS: More than 95% of the healthcare workers surveyed were willing to vaccinate. These respondents were more likely to perceive the pandemic as severe, consider the vaccine safe, have less financial concerns, less stigmatization regarding the vaccine, higher pro-socialness mindset and trust in health authorities. A high perceived pandemic risk index, low vaccine harm index and high pro-socialness index were independent predictors in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of healthcare workers in Asia are willing to receive COVID-19 vaccination. Perceived COVID-19 susceptibility, low potential risk of vaccine harm and pro-socialness are the main drivers.

To date, there is no proven curative treatment for this virus; as a result, prevention remains to be the best strategy to combat coronavirus infection (COVID-19). Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) has been proposed to play a role in coronavirus infection (COVID-19). However, there is no conclusive evidence on its impact on COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the present review aimed to summarize the available evidence regarding the association between Vitamin D levels and the risk of COVID-19 infection. Methods: A systematic literature search of databases (PUBMED/MEDLINE, Cochrane/Wiley library, Scopus, and SciELO) were conducted from May 15, 2020, to December 20, 2020. Studies that assessed the effect of vitamin D level on COVID-19/SARS-2 infection were considered for the review. The qualities of the included studies were evaluated using the JBI tools. Meta-analysis with a random-effects model was conducted and odds ratio with their 95%CI were reported. This systematic review and meta-analysis are reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline. Results: The electronic and supplementary searches for this review yielded 318 records from which, only 14 of them met the inclusion criteria. The qualitative synthesis indicated that vitamin D deficient individuals were at higher risk of COVID-19 infection as compared to vitamin D sufficient patients. The pooled analysis showed that individuals with Vitamin-D deficiency were 80% more likely to acquire COVID-19 infection as compared to those who have sufficient Vitamin D levels (OR = 1.80; 95%CI: 1.72, 1.88). Begg's test also revealed that there was no significant publication bias between the studies (P = 0.764). The subgroup analysis revealed that the risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection was relatively higher in the case-control study design (OR = 1.81). Conclusions: In conclusion, low serum 25 (OH) Vitamin-D level was significantly associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. The limited currently available data suggest that sufficient Vitamin D level in serum is associated with a significantly decreased risk of COVID-19 infection.","Teshome, Amare; Adane, Aynishet; Girma, Biruk; Mekonnen, Zeleke A",Front Public Health,221,16

These self-directed experiences are more often aimed at an activity/assignment level of instruction, allowing students to explore topics personally through inquiry. With the shift to online instruction caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to take student-led instruction to the curricular level. This fall semester, I employed a ?Choose your own adventure? approach to instruction, giving students the ability to tackle subjects in the order they chose to rather than the order determined by the instructor or the book. In preparing for the fall semester, I focused on redeveloping my undergraduate non-major physiology course in a way that allowed students the most flexibility- fully asynchronous presentation. The move to an asynchronous teaching model required the creation of activities and presentations that students could attend to on their own schedule. While creating these resources, I decided to make the class even more asynchronous by allowing students to choose the path of learning that they took through the course. Following a short introduction and review module, students were allowed to choose the order that they would cover material in the course during three ?blocks? of information;each with its own quizzes, activities and an exam. Following each block, I asked students why they chose that section, whether they would alter their study habits for the next block of material and a series of Likert-scale questions addressing aspects of their comfort, motivation and learning. At the end of the course, I asked students if they had approached the class differently than traditional courses, whether they would rearrange the material within each block and whether they would like to have additional courses taught in this method.","Petzold, Andrew",The FASEB Journal,221,25

Compared with the pre-pandemic period, OHCAs during the pandemic period more likely occurred at home (aOR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.24-1.75) and were witnessed (aOR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.49-1.97). They received less bystander CPR (aOR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.61-0.81) despite 65% of witnessed arrests by a family member, and waited longer for EMS (OR &#8805; 10 min: 1.71, 95% CI 1.46-2.00). Pre-hospital ROSC was less likely during the pandemic period (aOR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.53-0.84). The pandemic saw increased OHCA incidence and worse outcomes in Singapore, likely indirect effects of COVID-19.","Lim, Shir Lynn; Shahidah, Nur; Saffari, Seyed Ehsan; Ng, Qin Xiang; Ho, Andrew Fu Wah; Leong, Benjamin Sieu-Hon; Arulanandam, Shalini; Siddiqui, Fahad Javaid; Ong, Marcus Eng Hock",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),221,26

We investigated the association between receipt of tocilizumab and mortality in a large cohort of hospitalized patients. METHODS: In this cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Spain, the primary outcome was time to death and the secondary outcome time to intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. We used inverse probability weighting to fit marginal structural models adjusted for time-varying covariates to determine the causal relationship between receipt of tocilizumab and outcome. RESULTS: Data from 1229 patients were analysed, with 261 patients (61 deaths) in the tocilizumab group and 969 patients (120 deaths) in the control group. In the adjusted marginal structural models, a significant interaction between receipt of tocilizumab and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels was detected. Tocilizumab was associated with decreased risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.34, 95% confidence interval 0.16-0.72, p 0.005) and ICU admission or death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.19-0.80, p 0.011) among patients with baseline CRP >150 mg/L but not among those with CRP &#8804;150 mg/L. Exploratory subgroup analyses yielded point estimates that were consistent with these findings. CONCLUSIONS: In this large observational study, tocilizumab was associated with a lower risk of death or ICU admission or death in patients with higher CRP levels. While the results of ongoing clinical trials of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 will be important to establish its safety and efficacy, our findings have implications for the design of future clinical trials.","Martínez-Sanz, Javier; Muriel, Alfonso; Ron, Raquel; Herrera, Sabina; Pérez-Molina, José A; Moreno, Santiago; Serrano-Villar, Sergio",Clin. microbiol. infect,221,14

This study aims to elucidate the risk factors predictive of more severe outcomes in patients with diabetes by comparing the clinical characteristics of those requiring inpatient admissions with those who remain outpatient. METHODS: A retrospective review identified 832 patients-631 inpatients and 201 outpatients-with diabetes and a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result between March 1 and June 15, 2020. Comparisons between the outpatient and inpatient cohorts were conducted to identify risk factors associated with severity of disease determined by admission rate and mortality. Previous dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor use and disease outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Risk factors for increased admission included older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.04 [95% CI, 1.01-1.06]; P = .003), the presence of chronic kidney disease (OR, 2.32 [1.26-4.28]; P = .007), and a higher hemoglobin A1c at the time of admission (OR, 1.25 [1.12-1.39]; P < .001). Lower admission rates were seen in those with commercial insurance. Increased mortality was seen in individuals with older age (OR, 1.09 [1.07-1.11]; P < .001), higher body mass index number (OR, 1.04 [1.01-1.07]; P = .003), and higher hemoglobin A1c value at the time of diagnosis of COVID-19 (OR, 1.12 [1.01-1.24]; P = .028) and patients requiring hospitalization. Lower mortality was seen in those with hyperlipidemia. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor use prior to COVID-19 infection was not associated with a decreased hospitalization rate.

We examined factors associated with final malignant pathology and evaluated the postoperative course of patients with DA versus pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients with DA who underwent PD from 2008 to 2018 and assessed the accuracy rate of preoperative biopsy and factors associated with final malignant pathology. Complications for DA patients were compared with those of matched PDAC patients. RESULTS: Forty-five consecutive patients who underwent PD for DA were identified, and the preoperative biopsy false negative rate was 29. Factors associated with final malignant pathology included age over 70 years, preoperative biliary obstruction, and common bile duct diameter > 8 mm (p < 0.05). Compared with patients with PDAC (n = 302), DA patients experienced more major complications (31% vs. 15%, p < 0.01), more grade C postoperative pancreatic fistulas (9% vs. 1%, p < 0.01), and greater mortality (7% vs. 2%, p < 0.05). Propensity score matched patients with DA had more major complications following PD (32% vs. 12%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative biopsy of duodenal adenomas is associated with a high false-negative rate for malignancy, and PD for DA is associated with higher complication rates than PD for PDAC. These results aid discussion among patients and surgeons who are considering observation versus PD for DA, especially in younger patients without biliary obstruction, who are less likely to harbor malignancy.","Eng, Nina L; Mustin, Danielle E; Lovasik, Brendan P; Turgeon, Michael K; Gamboa, Adriana C; Shah, Mihir M; Cardona, Kenneth; Sarmiento, Juan M; Russell, Maria C; Maithel, Shishir K; Switchenko, Jeffrey M; Kooby, David A",Ann. surg. oncol,221,1

The pathophysiology of these lesions is still widely debated and an association with SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unconfirmed. OBJECTIVES: This paper focus on the unresolved issues about these COVID toes and in particular whether or not they are associated with COVID-19. ARGUMENTS: The temporal link between the outbreak of chilblains and the COVID-19 pandemic is a first suggests a link between the two events. Positive anti-SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 immunostaining on skin biopsy of chilblains seem to confirm the presence of the virus in the lesions, but lack specificity and must be interpreted with caution. Conversely, RT-PCR and anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology were negative in the majority of patients with chilblains. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection can be excluded, with relative certainty, even after accounting for possible lower immunization in mild/asymptomatic patients and for some differences in sensitivity/specificity between the tests used. Some authors hypothesize that chilblains could be the cutaneous expression of a strong type I interferon (IFN-I) response. High production of IFN-I is suggested to be associated with early viral control and may suppress antibody response. However, the absence of other cutaneous or extracutaneous symptoms as observed in other interferonopathies raises unanswered questions. To date, a direct link between chilblains and COVID-19 still seems impossible to confirm. A more indirect association due to lifestyle changes induced by lockdown is a possible explanation. Improvement of chilblains when protective measures were adopted and after lifting of lockdown, support this hypothesis. CONCLUSION: Conflicting current evidence highlights the need for systematic and repeated testing of larger numbers of patients and the need for valid follow-up data that take into consideration epidemic curves and evolution of lockdown measures.","Baeck, Marie; Herman, Anne",Int J Infect Dis,221,18

It was initially reported that, in patients with serious progression of COVID-19, there was an increased mortality in those that had a history of suffering arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. A proportion of these patients also had in common that they used ACE-I, which alerted the medical community on the potential risk in coexisting with COVID-19. However, in more recent case-control studies, they found that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, including ACE-I, does not increase the risk of COVID-19 or require hospital admission due to this cause. Several scientific journals have provided access to preliminary reports, leaving the use of such information at the discretion of the medical and scientific community for promoting the development of studies that might confirm these preclinical and epidemiological findings experimentally. These may finally have an impact on the clinical practice decisions, in order to benefit patients with COVID-19. In this literature review, the different effects mediated by ACE-I that could be related to the immune response during the infection and transmission of COVID-19 are examined, gathering available evidence that evaluates whether, in reality, they represent a risk or if on the other hand, they confer a protector effect.","Vallejo Ardila, Dora Lucía; Tamayo Cáceres, Yenny Rocío; Munive, Abraham Alí",Rev.

The optimal selection of interventions targeting the virus is unknown. Therefore, evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to support specific treatment against COVID-19 is urgently needed. The use of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) might have a role in the treatment and symptomatic management of patients with COVID-19. It was aimed at providing an overview of the available evidence and ongoing trials concerning the effects of CHMs for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: This is a narrative review of relevant studies. Searches were conducted to identify documents published till April 22, 2020. Electronic databases, evidence-based collections, websites of relevant organizations, and trial registries were consulted. Results: A total of 25 guidelines on the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were identified. Four guidelines provided recommendations on the use of CHMs; these guidelines were developed in China and South Korea and were based on the consensus of experts exclusively. The remaining 21 guidelines provided no guidance on CHMs. No finished RCTs of CHMs for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 was found. According to the evidence evaluated in this review, a Cochrane review of CHMs for severe acute respiratory syndrome and five uncontrolled observational studies of the effects of CHMs in patients with COVID-19, the effects of CHMs for COVID-19 are unknown. A total of 52 ongoing clinical trials of CHM interventions for the treatment of COVID-19 were found. These trials will be carried out mostly in China (n = 51). Forty (77%) of the ongoing trials will be randomized, whereas 12 (23%) have an unclear sequence generation procedure. Forty-seven trials (90%) will have a sample size <400 participants. Conclusions: To the authors' knowledge, only the Chinese and the South Korean guidelines recommend CHMs as a treatment option for patients with COVID-19. These guidelines base their recommendations on the consensus of experts. Clinical guidelines or health authorities from other countries do not provide advice on CHMs. Due to the absence of RCT, there is currently no reliable evidence on the effects of any specific CHM intervention for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A high number of clinical trials of different herbal products are being currently conducted in China.","López-Alcalde, Jesús; Yan, Yuqian; Witt, Claudia M; Barth, Jürgen",J Altern Complement Med,221,26

DESIGN: We will carry out a two-week, individually randomized, parallel group, controlled trial. Participants will be individually randomized to receive the PsyCovidApp intervention or control App intervention. METHODS: The PsyCovidApp intervention will include five modules: emotional skills, lifestyle behaviour, work stress and burnout, social support, and practical tools. Healthcare workers having attended patients with COVID-19 will be randomized to receive the PsyCovidApp intervention (intervention group) or a control App intervention (control group). A total of 440 healthcare workers will be necessary to assure statistical power. Measures will be collected telephonically by a team of psychologists at baseline and immediately after the 2 weeks intervention period. Measures will include stress, depression and anxiety (DASS-21 questionnaire-primary endpoint), insomnia (ISI), burnout (MBI-HSS), post-traumatic stress disorder (DTS), and self-efficacy (GSE). The study was funded in May 2020, and was ethically approved in June 2020. Trial participants, outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded to group allocation. DISCUSSION: Despite the increasing use of mobile health interventions to deliver mental health care, this area of research is still on its infancy. This study will help increase the scientific evidence about the effectiveness of this type of intervention on this specific population and context. IMPACT: Despite the lack of solid evidence about their effectiveness, mobile-based health interventions are already being widely implemented because of their low cost and high scalability. The findings from this study will help health services and organizations to make informed decisions in relation to the development and implementation of this type of interventions, allowing them pondering not only their attractive implementability features, but also empirical data about its benefits.

The aim of this systematic review was to appraise the quality and availability of guidelines, and whether non-invasive ventilation in the early stages of the pandemic is of importance. DESIGN AND METHOD: Databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, as well as websites of international organizations and gray literature, were searched up to June 23, 2020. The reference lists of eligible papers were also hand-searched. RESULTS: A total of 26 guidelines met the inclusion criteria. According to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument, the guidelines' methodological quality was low. Among six domains, Rigour of Development and Editorial Independence were of the lowest quality. Given the lack of evidence from randomized clinical trials and the great variation between different regions, recommendations for non-invasive ventilation have generated considerable debate regarding the early stages of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Improving the methodological quality of the guidelines should be a goal with regard to future pandemics. Additionally, better-designed randomized clinical trials are needed to resolve contradictions regarding the impact of non-invasive ventilation.

For many people, this occurred in the context of working from makeshift home offices with novel distractions. We describe the results of an online survey of mental health clinicians and staff regarding their experiences in rapidly converting to full-time TMH and work from home (WFH) during COVID-19. Methods: Fourteen clinicians and 11 administrative staff from two outpatient mental health clinics in a large academic medical center completed the survey in May 2020. Results: More than 85% of participants rated the experience of providing or supporting full-time TMH care as ""somewhat better"" or ""much better than expected."" Clinicians and administrative staff reported perceptions that most clients were satisfied with TMH services. Identified TMH challenges included difficulty providing clinical forms and difficulties with technology. Identified benefits of WFH included lack of commute, time with loved ones, opportunities for self-care, and increased flexibility. Maintaining team cohesion and communication while working remotely, and setting boundaries between work and nonwork hours were identified as challenges. Nearly all respondents indicated a preference to continue some TMH from home in the future. Conclusions: Findings suggest that rapidly adopting TMH and WFH during a pandemic were well accepted. Should the progression of the pandemic require agile movement in and out of TMH and WFH, overcommunication and extra attention to supporting employee connection and morale are especially important.","Steidtmann, Dana; McBride, Samantha; Mishkind, Matthew C",Telemed. j. e. health,221,22

Fifty five multiparous cows, stabled in the same farm, were randomly divided in three groups; cows of Group A were dressed on their back with deltamethrin, cows of Group B remained untreated within the same pen and cows of Group C remained untreated in a separate pen. Clinical records of the herd showed a history of clinical and subclinical mastitis (especially during spring and early summer) and fly infestation. Deltamethrin reduced fly population, landing on the cows of Group A, facilitating a significant decrease of S. aureus, coagulase negative staplylococci, E. coli intramammary infections and somatic cell count, throughout the study period. Consequently, there is a relationship between fly abundance and transmission of bacteria resulting in intramammary infections and mastitis in dairy cows. The use of the pyrethroid deltamethrin reduced fly abundance and therefore, the possibility of transmitting pathogenic bacteria in the mammary gland.","Arsenopoulos, Konstantinos; Triantafillou, Eleftherios; Filioussis, George; Papadopoulos, Elias",Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,221,16

For instance, Spain has experienced a gradual but steady increase in suicides since the 80’s and it is currently the leading external cause of death in the country. At the same time, the dualisation of the labor market, with a strong and persistent incidence of temporary contracts, has increased the instability of employment conditions. Both developments have a stronger incidence for individuals with lower levels of education. Therefore, in this paper we use rich administrative data in order to estimate the impact of the wide spread use of temporary contracts on suicides. In order to do that we exploit a reform that liberalised the use of fix-term contracts in Spain in 1984. Our results show strong long-term effects of the reform, which increased the suicide mortality rate of affected cohorts (those entering the labor market just after the liberalisation) by at least 25.3%. We believe that this result has important policy implications and should be taken into account in the design of the national suicide prevention plans.","Grèbol Jiménez, Ricard; Vall Castelló, Judit",PLoS One,221,20

They have been historically utilised as herbal medicine to treat various diseases. However, the comprehensive assessment of them still remains a challenge. OBJECTIVE: To develop a comprehensive method of ultra‐fast liquid chromatography‐tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UFLC‐QTRAP‐MS/MS) coupled with multivariate statistical analysis for the quality evaluation and reveal differential components of LJF and LF. METHODOLOGY: A validated UFLC‐QTRAP‐MS/MS method was established for simultaneous determination of 50 constituents, including 12 organic acids, 12 flavonoids, 6 iridoids, 3 saponins, 13 amino acids and 4 nucleosides. The obtained data were employed to multivariate statistical analysis. Principal component anlysis (PCA) and partial least squares determinant analysis (PLS‐DA) were performed to classify and reveal differential components of samples; grey relational analysis (GRA) was introduced to assess the samples according to the contents of 50 constituents by calculating the relative correlation degree of each sample. RESULTS: Fifty constituents were simultaneously determined of LJF and LF. Based on obtained data, PCA and PLS‐DA were easy to distinguish samples and the classification of the samples was related to 11 chemical constituents. GRA implied the quality of LJF was better, and that the flower buds were superior to the flowers. Moreover, organic acids are the main components of samples. CONCLUSION: This study not only established a method of simultaneous determination of multiple bioactive constituents in LJF and LF, but provided comprehensive information on the quality control of them. The developed method is conducive to distinguish orthologues or paralogues of them, and supply the support for “heterologous effects”.","Cai, Zhichen; Wang, Chengcheng; Chen, Cuihua; Zou, Lisi; Chai, Chuan; Chen, Jiali; Tan, Mengxia; Liu, Xunhong",Phytochem Anal,221,26

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study including prospectively collected information of patients admitted to 165 ICUs in a hospital network in Brazil between 2011 and 2020. Association between admission in 2020 and worse hospital outcomes was performed using different techniques, including assessment of changes in illness severity of admitted patients, a variable life-adjusted display of mortality during 2020, a multivariate mixed regression model with admission year as both fixed effect and random slope adjusted for SAPS 3 score, an analysis of trends in performance using standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and standardized resource use (SRU), and perturbation analysis. RESULTS: A total of 644,644 admissions were considered. After excluding readmissions and patients with COVID-19, 514,219 patients were available for analysis. Non-COVID-19 patients admitted in 2020 had slightly lower age and SAPS 3 score but a higher mortality (6.4%) when compared with previous years (2019: 5.6%; 2018: 6.1%). Variable-adjusted life display (VLAD) in 2020 increased but started to decrease as the number of COVID-19 cases increased; this trend reversed as number of COVID cases reduced but recurred on the second wave. After logistic regression, being admitted in 2020 was associated with higher mortality when compared to previous years from 2016 and 2019. Individual ICUs standardized mortality ratio also increased during 2020 (higher SMR) while resource use remained constant, suggesting worsening performance. A perturbation analysis further confirmed changes in ICU outcomes for non-COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Hospital outcomes of non-COVID-19 critically ill patients worsened during the pandemic in 2020, possibly resulting in an increased number of deaths in critically ill non-COVID patients.

This study combines field and satellite weather data to determine factors that influence dead fuel moisture content (FMC). It assesses the use of the Canadian forest fire weather index to determine the daily forest fire danger in a typical temperate forest in Northeastern China during autumn. Based on the Wilcoxon test for paired samples, the observed and predicted values of FMC showed similar variation in eight of eleven sampling sites (72.7%), with a p value > 0.05. Three sampling plots presented lower predicted values of FMC than observed values (27.3%), with a p value < 0.05. The calculation of fire risk using the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Rating System (CFFDRS) in Maoer Mountain forest ecosystems presented low, medium or high risk; thus, the CFFDRS is suitable for determining fire danger in our study region.

METHOD: Patients treated for laryngotracheal lesions with impending airway compromise during the active pandemic period were matched with those treated for similar lesions in the preceding years in a monocentric tertiary hospital setting. RESULTS: During the pandemic period of 55 days, 31 patients underwent 47 procedures. Seven patients (2 children, 5 adults) had open airway surgery, and one had an operation-specific complication. Twenty-four patients (10 children, 14 adults) underwent 40 endoscopic interventions without any complications. Operation specific results during and prior to the pandemic were comparable. CONCLUSION: The management strategy in patients with laryngotracheal lesions and impending airway compromise should not be altered during periods of risk from coronavirus disease 2019. Avoiding a tracheostomy by performing primary corrective surgery or proceeding with a definitive decannulation would be beneficial in these patients to reduce the risk of contagion.","Gombert, E; Ishii, A; Guilcher, P; Gorostidi, F; Cantarella, G; Pignataro, L; Sandu, K",J Laryngol Otol,221,20

Leaders need to understand the vital role of behavioral health services in a population-based, integrated healthcare framework and address the needs of the behavioral health workforce to successfully deploy services in their organizations and communities.During the ongoing national response to COVID-19, three major trends have emerged: (1) a shift to telehealth and digital care, (2) greater awareness of the impact on the workforce of the shift to digital care, and (3) an open dialogue to counteract the stigma and discrimination related to mental illness and to emphasize mental well-being instead. When they address stigma and discrimination, healthcare leaders embrace a more holistic approach that welcomes behavioral health professionals as equal, vital members of the care team. They help their organizations advance the mental well-being of all.","Merz, Stephen M",Frontiers of health services management,221,24

We initiated a clinical study based on frequent, longitudinal workplace disease surveillance to control severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission among employees and their household members. We hypothesized that the study would reduce the economic burden and loss of productivity of both individuals and small businesses resulting from standard isolation methods, while providing new insights into virus-host dynamics. Study participants (27 employees and 27 household members) consented to provide frequent nasal or oral swab samples that were analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Two study participants were found to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the study. One subject, a household member, was SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive for at least 71 days and had quantifiable serum virus-specific antibody concentrations for over 1 year. One unrelated employee became positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA over the course of the study but remained asymptomatic, with low associated viral RNA copy numbers, no detectable serum IgM and IgG concentrations, and IgA concentrations that decayed rapidly (half-life: 1.3 days). A COVID-19 infection model was used to predict that without surveillance intervention, up to 7 employees (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3 to 10) would have become infected, with at most 1 of them requiring hospitalization. Our scalable and transferable surveillance plan met its primary objectives and represents a powerful example of an innovative public health initiative dovetailed with scientific discovery. IMPORTANCE The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the associated COVID-19 has precipitated a global pandemic heavily challenging our social behavior, economy, and health care infrastructure. In the absence of widespread, worldwide access to safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics, public health measures represent a key intervention for curbing the devastating impacts from the pandemic. We are conducting an ongoing clinical study based on frequent, longitudinal workplace disease surveillance to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission among employees and their household members. Our study was successful in surveying the viral and immune response dynamics in two participants with unusual infections: one remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 for 71 days, while the other was asymptomatic, with low associated viral RNA copy numbers. A COVID-19 infection model was used to predict that without surveillance intervention, up to 7 employees would have become infected, with at most 1 of them requiring hospitalization, underscoring the importance of our program.","Gunawardana, Manjula; Breslin, Jessica; Cortez, John M.; Rivera, Sofia; Webster, Simon; Ibarrondo, F.

In this paper, we propose a mathematical model which allows us to investigate and analyse this problem. We show by means of the reproductive number, [Image: see text] that the containment measures appear to have slowed the growth of the outbreak. Nevertheless, these measures remain only effective as long as a very large fraction of population, p, greater than the critical value [Image: see text] remains confined. Using French current data, we give some simulation experiments with five scenarios including: (i) the validation of model with p estimated to 93%, (ii) the study of the effectiveness of containment measures, (iii) the study of the effectiveness of the large-scale testing, (iv) the study of the social distancing and wearing masks measures and (v) the study taking into account the combination of the large-scale test of detection of infected individuals and the social distancing with linear progressive easing of restrictions. The latter scenario was shown to be effective at overcoming the outbreak if the transmission rate decreases to 75% and the number of tests of detection is multiplied by three. We also noticed that if the measures studied in our five scenarios are taken separately then the second wave might occur at least as far as the parameter values remain unchanged.","Zongo, P.; Zorom, M.; Mophou, G.; Dorville, R.; Beaumont, C.",Epidemiol Infect,221,20

In this study we aim to understand how different factors (including virus type, surface type, time since last handwash, and direction of transfer) affect virus transfer rates, defined as the fraction of virus transferred, between fingerpads and fomites. To determine this, 360 transfer events were performed with 20 volunteers using Phi6 (a surrogate for enveloped viruses) and MS2 (a surrogate for non-enveloped viruses), and three clean surfaces (stainless steel, painted wood, and plastic). Considering all transfer events (all surfaces and both transfer directions combined), the mean transfer rates of Phi6 and MS2 were 0.17 and 0.26, respectively. Transfer of MS2 was significantly higher than Phi6 (P<0.05). Surface type was a significant factor that affected the transfer rate of Phi6: Phi6 is more easily transferred to and from stainless steel and plastic than to and from painted wood. Direction of transfer was a significant factor affecting MS2 transfer rates: MS2 is more easily transferred from surfaces to fingerpads than from fingerpads to surfaces. Data from these virus transfer events, and subsequent transfer rate distributions, provide information which can be used to refine quantitative microbial risk assessments. This study provides a large-scale data set of transfer events with a surrogate for enveloped viruses, which extends the reach of the study to the role of fomites in the transmission of human enveloped viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Importance This study created a large-scale data set for the transfer of enveloped viruses between skin and surfaces. The data set produced by this study provides information on modelling the distribution of enveloped and non-enveloped virus transfer rates, which can aid in the implementation of risk assessment models in the future. Additionally, enveloped and non-enveloped viruses were applied to experimental surfaces in an equivalent matrix to avoid matrix effects, so results between different viral species can be directly compared without confounding effects of different matrices. Our results indicating how virus type, surface type, time since last handwash, and direction of transfer affect virus transfer rates can be used in decision-making processes to lower the risk of viral infection from transmission through fomites.","Anderson, Claire E; Boehm, Alexandria B",Appl Environ Microbiol,221,1

Diabetes may increase the risk of latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (LTBI), but the magnitude of this effect is less clear. Whilst this syndemic has received considerable attention, most of the published research has focussed on screening for undiagnosed diabetes in TB patients or observational follow-up of TB treatment outcomes by diabetes status. There are thus substantial research and policy gaps, particularly with regard to prevention of TB disease in people with diabetes and management of patients with TB–diabetes, both during TB treatment and after successful completion of TB treatment, when they likely remain at high risk of TB recurrence, mortality from TB and cardiovascular disease. Potential strategies to prevent development of TB disease might include targeted vaccination programmes, screening for LTBI and preventive therapy among diabetes patients or, perhaps ideally, improved diabetes management and prevention. The cost-effectiveness of each of these, and in particular how each strategy might compare with targeted TB prevention among other population groups at higher risk of developing TB disease, is also unknown. Despite research gaps, clinicians urgently need practical management advice and more research evidence on the choice and dose of different anti-diabetes medication and effective medical therapies to reduce cardiovascular risks (statins, anti-hypertensives and aspirin). Substantial health system strengthening and integration may be needed to prevent these at risk patients being lost to care at the end of TB treatment.","van Crevel, Reinout; Critchley, Julia A.",Trop Med Infect Dis,221,20

Public intention to take a COVID-19 vaccine if offered is high in the UK, but evidence of disparities between ethnic, social and age groups has led to concern. Methods Online survey of prospective household community cohort study participants across England and Wales (Virus Watch). Vaccination intention was measured by individual participant responses to ‘Would you accept a COVID-19 vaccine if offered?’, collected in December 2020 and February 2021. Responses to a 13-item questionnaire collected in January 2021 were analysed using factor analysis to investigate psychological influences on vaccination intention. Results Survey response rate was 56% (20,785/36,998) in December 2020 and 53% (20,590/38,727) in February 2021, with 14880 adults reporting across both time points. Of participants reporting across both timepoints, 13,411 (90%) answered ‘Yes’ and 1,469 (10%) responded ‘No’ or ‘Unsure’ in December 2020. Of those answering ‘No’ or ‘Unsure’ in December 2020, 1,266 (86%) subsequently answered ‘Yes’ or ‘Already had a COVID-19 vaccine’ in February 2021. Vaccination intention increased across all ethnic groups and levels of social deprivation. Age was most strongly associated with vaccination intention, with 16–24-year-olds more likely to respond “Unsure” or “No” versus “Yes” than 65-74-year-olds in December 2020 (OR: 4.63, 95%CI: 3.42, 6.27 & OR 7.17 95%CI: 4.26, 12.07 respectively) and February 2021 (OR: 27.92 95%CI: 13.79, 56.51 & OR 17.16 95%CI: 4.12, 71.55).

It is important to know how these lockdowns affected businesses, such as restaurants, in regions that vary in terms of poverty status and geography. In this paper, we analyze the differential changes in rural and urban restaurant visits by the restaurants’ NAICS codes following the COVID-19 lockdowns. Our analysis contributes to the public policy literature and helps operational planning for food distribution during a pandemic. METHODS: Since urban and rural consumer behavior and food resources are significantly different, it is crucial to conduct a comparative analysis. Our study applies a difference-in-differences model to capture the differential effects lockdowns have on urban and rural restaurants. RESULTS: We find that restaurant visits declined significantly in both rural and urban counties after shelter-at-home orders. The decrease in total restaurant visits was almost twice as high in urban counties as in rural counties. We also find that visits to fast-food restaurants increased in rural counties during shelter-at-home orders. CONCLUSIONS: These results contribute to previous studies on the dearth of healthy food in rural and poorer regions, and inform important public policy response in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Banerjee, Tannista; Nayak, Arnab; Zhao, HaiYue",Z Gesundh Wiss,221,17

OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors on hospital admission that are predictive of severe disease or death from COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: Five hospitals in the Maryland and Washington, DC, area. PATIENTS: 832 consecutive COVID-19 admissions from 4 March to 24 April 2020, with follow-up through 27 June 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Patient trajectories and outcomes, categorized by using the World Health Organization COVID-19 disease severity scale. Primary outcomes were death and a composite of severe disease or death. RESULTS: Median patient age was 64 years (range, 1 to 108 years); 47% were women, 40% were Black, 16% were Latinx, and 21% were nursing home residents. Among all patients, 131 (16%) died and 694 (83%) were discharged (523 [63%] had mild to moderate disease and 171 [20%] had severe disease). Of deaths, 66 (50%) were nursing home residents. Of 787 patients admitted with mild to moderate disease, 302 (38%) progressed to severe disease or death: 181 (60%) by day 2 and 238 (79%) by day 4. Patients had markedly different probabilities of disease progression on the basis of age, nursing home residence, comorbid conditions, obesity, respiratory symptoms, respiratory rate, fever, absolute lymphocyte count, hypoalbuminemia, troponin level, and C-reactive protein level and the interactions among these factors. Using only factors present on admission, a model to predict in-hospital disease progression had an area under the curve of 0.85, 0.79, and 0.79, at day 2, 4, and 7, respectively.

METHODS: Two population-based UK primary care cohorts were delineated in the Aurum and GOLD datasets of the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We included data from 9,133,246 individuals aged 1–20 who contributed 117,682,651 person-years of observation time. Sex- and age-stratified annual incidence rates were estimated for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (age groups: 1–5, 6–9, 10–12, 13–16, 17–19), depression, anxiety disorders (6–9, 10–12, 13–16, 17–19), eating disorders and self-harm (10–12, 13–16, 17–19) during 2003–2018. We fitted negative binomial regressions to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) to examine change in incidence between the first (2003) and final year (2018) year of observation and to examine sex-specific incidence. RESULTS: The results indicated that the overall incidence has increased substantially in both boys and girls in between 2003 and 2018 for anxiety disorders (IRR 3.51 95% CI 3.18–3.89), depression (2.37; 2.03–2.77), ASD (2.36; 1.72–3.26), ADHD (2.3; 1.73–3.25), and self-harm (2.25; 1.82–2.79). The incidence for eating disorders also increased (IRR 1.3 95% CI 1.06–1.61), but less sharply. The incidence of anxiety disorders, depression, self-harm and eating disorders was in absolute terms higher in girls, whereas the opposite was true for the incidence of ADHD and ASD, which were higher among boys. The largest relative increases in incidence were observed for neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly among girls diagnosed with ADHD or ASD. However, in absolute terms, the incidence was much higher for depression and anxiety disorders. CONCLUSION: The number of young people seeking help for psychological distress appears to have increased in recent years. Changes to diagnostic criteria, reduced stigma, and increased awareness may partly explain our results, but we cannot rule out true increases in incidence occurring in the population. Whatever the explanation, the marked rise in demand for healthcare services means that it may be more challenging for affected young people to promptly access the care and support that they need.

As a result, surgical care was restricted to urgent cases of surgery. However, the care for trauma patients is not suitable for reduction or delayed treatment. The influence of the pandemic on the burden of disease of trauma care remains to be elucidated. METHODS: All patients with traumatic injuries that were presented to the emergency departments (ED) of the Amsterdam University Medical Center, Location Academic Medical Center (AMC) and VU medical center (VUMC) and the Northwest Clinics (NWC) between March 10, 2019 and May 10, 2019 (non-COVID) and March 10, 2020 and May 10, 2020 (COVID-19 period) were included. The primary outcome was the difference in ED admissions for trauma patients between the non-COVID and COVID-19 study period. Additionally, patient- and injury characteristics, health care consumption, and 30-day mortality were evaluated. RESULTS: A 37% reduction of ED admissions for trauma patients was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic (non-COVID n = 2423 and COVID cohort n = 1531). Hospital admission was reduced by 1.6 trauma patients per day. Fewer patients sustained car- and sports-related injuries. Injuries after high energetic trauma were more severe in the COVID-19 period (Injury Severity Score 17.3 vs. 12.0, p = 0.006). Relatively more patients were treated operatively (21.4% vs. 16.6%, p < 0.001) during the COVID-19 period. Upper-(17.6 vs. 12.5%, p = 0.002) and lower extremity injuries (30.7 vs. 23.0%, p = 0.002) mainly accounted for this difference.

Complement factors are being considered as targets for therapeutic intervention Objective We here characterize ARGX-117, a humanized inhibitory monoclonal antibody against complement C2. Methods The mode-of-action and binding characteristics of ARGX-117 were investigated in detail. Furthermore, its efficacy was analyzed in in vitro complement cytotoxicity assays. Finally, a PK/PD study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. Results Through binding to the Sushi-2 domain of C2, ARGX-117 prevents the formation of the C3 proconvertase, and inhibits classical and lectin pathway activation upstream of C3 activation. As ARGX-117 does not inhibit the alternative pathway it is expected not to affect the antimicrobial activity of this complement pathway. ARGX-117 prevents complement-mediated cytotoxicity in in vitro models for autoimmune hemolytic anemia and antibody-mediated rejection of organ transplants. ARGX-117 exhibits pH- and calcium-dependent target binding and is Fc-engineered to increase affinity at acidic pH to FcRn, and to reduce effector functions. In cynomolgus monkeys, ARGX-117 dose-dependently reduces free C2 levels and classical pathway activity. A two-dose regimen of 80 and 20 mg/kg separated by a week, resulted in profound reduction of classical pathway activity lasting for at least 7 weeks. Conclusion ARGX-117 is a promising new complement inhibitor that is uniquely positioned to target both the classical and lectin pathway while leaving the alternative pathway intact.","Van de Walle, Inge; Silence, Karen; Budding, Kevin; Van de Ven, Liesbeth; Dijkxhoorn, Kim; de Zeeuw, Elisabeth; Yildiz, Cafer; Gabriels, Sofie; Percier, Jean-Michel; Wildemann, Johanna; Meeldijk, Jan; Simons, Peter J.; Boon, Louis; Cox, Linda; Holgate, Rob; Urbanus, Rolf; Otten, Henny G.; Leusen, Jeanette H.W.; Blanchetot, Christophe; de Haard, Hans; Hack, C.

DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We included hospitalised adult patients at Northwell Health hospitals with confirmed COVID-19 infections between 1 March 2020 and 11 May 2020. We categorised changes in the FDA’s recommendation as pre-FDA approval (1 March 2020–27 March 2020), FDA approval (28 March 2020–23 April 2020), and FDA warning (24 April 2020–11 May 2020). The hydroxychloroquine-treated group received at least one dose within 48 hours of hospital admission. PRIMARY OUTCOME: A composite of intubation and inpatient death. RESULTS: The percentages of patients who were treated with hydroxychloroquine were 192/2202 (8.7%) pre-FDA approval, 2902/6741 (43.0%) FDA approval, and 176/1066 (16.5%) FDA warning period (p<0.001). Using propensity score matching, there was a higher rate of the composite outcome among patients treated with hydroxychloroquine (49/192, 25.5%) compared with no hydroxychloroquine (66/384, 17.2%) in the pre-FDA approval period (p=0.03) but not in the FDA approval period (25.5% vs 22.6%, p=0.08) or the FDA warning (21.0% vs 15.1%, p=0.11) periods. Coincidently, there was an increase in number of patients with COVID-19 and disease severity during the FDA approval period (24.1% during FDA approval vs 21.4% during pre-FDA approval period had the composite outcome). Hydroxychloroquine use was associated with increased odds of the composite outcome during the pre-FDA approval period (OR=1.65 (95% CI 1.09 to 2.51)) but not during the FDA approval (OR=1.17 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.39)) and FDA warning (OR=1.50 (95% CI 0.94 to 2.39)) periods. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine use was associated with adverse clinical outcomes only during the pre-FDA approval period but not during the FDA approval and warning periods, even after adjusting for concurrent changes in the percentage of patients with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine and the number (and disease severity) of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 infections.","Kim, Eun Ji; Coppa, Kevin; Hirsch, Jamie S; Abrahams, Sara; Johnson, Jennifer; Lesser, Martin; Davidson, Karina W; Conigliaro, Joseph",BMJ Open,221,18

Considering the positive association between narcoleptic symptoms and creativity, we aimed at exploring the psychological distress associated with COVID‐19 restrictions and its relationship with depressive symptoms and creativity in patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1). A total of 52 patients with NT1 and 50 healthy controls, who completed a previous study on creativity, were contacted during the first lockdown period to complete an online survey evaluating psychological distress related to the COVID‐19 outbreak, sleep quality, narcolepsy and depressive symptoms, and creative abilities. The patients with NT1 showed an improvement in subjective sleepiness while controls reported worsening of sleep quality during the lockdown. Depression and NT1 symptom severity proved significant predictors of COVID‐19‐related distress. Creative performance, namely generative fluency, turned out to be a favourable moderator in the relationship between depression and patients’ distress, reducing the detrimental effect of depression on the patients’ wellbeing. On the contrary, creative originality proved to be a disadvantageous moderator in the relationship between NT1 symptom severity and the distress associated with this traumatic event indicating a higher vulnerability to developing COVID‐19‐related distress, particularly evident in patients displaying higher originality. Overall, these results highlight a crucial role of creativity in patients with NT1, suggesting that creative potential could be used as a protective factor against the development of distress associated with the lockdown.","D’Anselmo, Anita; Agnoli, Sergio; Filardi, Marco; Pizza, Fabio; Mastria, Serena; Corazza, Giovanni Emanuele; Plazzi, Giuseppe",J Sleep Res,221,16

Hence, we studied the characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who presented with AMS at our hospital in rural southwest Georgia. METHODS: Data from electronic medical records of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients from March 2, 2020, to June 17, 2020, were analyzed. Patients were divided in 2 groups, those presenting with and without AMS. Primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were needed for mechanical ventilation, need for intensive care unit (ICU) care, need for dialysis, and length of stay. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 and R 3.6.0. RESULTS: Out of 710 patients, 73 (10.3%) presented with AMS. Majority of the population was African American (83.4%). Patients with AMS were older and more likely to have hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), cerebrovascular disease, and dementia. Patients with AMS were less likely to present with typical COVID-19 symptoms, including dyspnea, cough, fever, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Predictors of AMS included age ≥ 70 years, CKD, cerebrovascular disease, and dementia. After multivariable adjustment, patients with AMS had higher rates of in-hospital mortality (30.1% vs 14.8%, odds ratio (OR) 2.139, p = 0.019), ICU admission (43.8% vs 40.2%, OR 2.59, p < 0.001), and need for mechanical ventilation (27.4% vs 18.5%, OR 2.06, p = 0.023). Patients presenting with AMS had increased length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 presenting with AMS are less likely to have typical COVID-19 symptoms, and AMS is an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality, need for ICU admission, and need for mechanical ventilation.","Kenerly, Marjorie J.; Shah, Priyank; Patel, Hiten; Racine, Rilee; Jani, Yash; Owens, Caroline; George, Varghese; Linder, Daniel; Owens, Jack; Hess, David C.",Ir J Med Sci,221,16

Shortest fastest paths offer interesting insights about connectivity that were unknowable until recently. Moreover, distances and latencies tend to be computed by separate algorithms. We developed four algorithms that each compute all those values efficiently as a contribution to the literature. Two of those methods compute metrics from a fixed source temporal node. The other two, as a significant contribution to the literature, compute the metrics between all pairs of source and destination temporal nodes. The methods are also grouped by whether they work on paths with delays or not. Proofs of correctness for our algorithms are presented as well as bounds on their temporal complexities as functions of temporal network parameters. Experimental results show the algorithms presented perform well against the state of the art and terminate in decent time on real-world datasets.

Macrophages can readily recognize the virus and eliminate it. MERS-CoV infects cells via its Spike (S) glycoprotein that binds on Dipeptidyl-Peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor present on macrophages. Whether this Spike/DPP4 association affects macrophage responses remains unknown. Herein we demonstrated that infection of macrophages with lentiviral particles pseudotyped with MERS-CoV S glycoprotein results in suppression of macrophage responses since it reduced the capacity of macrophages to produce TNFa and IL-6 in naive and LPS-activated THP-1 macrophages and augmented LPS-induced production of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. MERS-CoV S glycoprotein induced the expression of the negative regulator of TLR signaling IRAK-M as well as of the transcriptional repressor PPARγ. Inhibition of DPP4 by its inhibitor sitagliptin or siRNA abrogated the effects of MERS-CoV S glycoprotein on IRAK-M, PPARγ and IL-10, confirming that its immunosuppressive effects were mediated by DPP4 receptor. The effect was observed both in THP-1 macrophages and human primary peripheral blood monocytes. These findings support a DPP4-mediated suppressive action of MERS-CoV in macrophages and suggest a potential target for effective elimination of its pathogenicity.","Al-Qahtani, Ahmed A.; Lyroni, Konstantina; Aznaourova, Marina; Tseliou, Melpomeni; Al-Anazi, Mashael R.; Al-Ahdal, Mohammed N.; Alkahtani, Saad; Sourvinos, George; Tsatsanis, Christos",Oncotarget,221,11

RESULTS: Twenty-six papers published from database inception to December 2018 were reviewed. A wide range of psychological and non-psychological outcomes were reported. There was a marked trend for isolated patients to exhibit higher levels of depression, the pooled standardised mean difference being 1.28 (95% CI 0.47 to 2.09) and anxiety 1.45 (95% CI 0.56 to 2.34), although both had high levels of heterogeneity, and worse outcomes for a range of care-related factors but with significant variation. CONCLUSION: The review indicates that isolation to contain the risk of infection has negative consequences for segregated patients. Although strength of the evidence is weak, comprising primarily single-centre convenience samples, consistency of the effects may strengthen this conclusion.

For this purpose, various samples of whole bacteria, fungi, pollen, media contaminated with viruses, and proteins were treated with an aliquot of methanolic tetramethylammonium hydroxide prior to thermal introduction into the ion source of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Molecular and fragment ions, consistent with fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and steroids (non-methylated and methylated), generated during electron ionization (70 eV) of the volatile hydrolysates were subsequently detected. The varying distributions and relative intensities of these ions were used to discriminate between the different biological samples. More specifically, it was found that polyunsaturated FAMEs and steroids could be used to differentiate eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic cells since the latter do not generally synthesize either of these lipid membrane constituents. Further discrimination of the different eukaryotic samples was made based on the detection of ergosterol for fungi, cholesterol for the viral media, and C18:3Me for pollen. Multivariate statistical analysis was employed to evaluate and compare the large set of mass spectra generated during the study and to build a trained model for predicting the class membership of test samples entered as unknowns. Of 132 different samples subjected to the model as unknowns, 131 were correctly classified into their proper biological categories. Moreover, 29 out of 30 bacteria test samples representing five species of pathogenic bacteria were correctly classified at the species level.","Madonna, Angelo J.; Voorhees, Kent J.; Hadfield, Ted L.",J Anal Appl Pyrolysis,221,20

This devastating viral infection has stimulated the urgent development of viable vaccine against COVID-19 across the research institutes around the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also confirmed that the recent pandemic is causing Public Health Emergency of International apprehension. Moreover, the earlier two pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and many others yet to be identified pose a universal menace. Here, in this piece of work, we have utilized an in silico structural biology and advanced immunoinformatic strategies to devise a multi-epitope subunit vaccine against ongoing COVID-19 infection. The engineered vaccine sequence is adjuvanted with ß-3 defensin and comprised of B-cell epitopes, HTL epitopes and CTL epitopes. This is very likely that the vaccine will be able to elicit the strong immune response. Further, specific binding of the engineered vaccine and immune cell receptor TLR3 was estimated by molecular interaction studies. Strong interaction in the binding groove as well as good docking scores affirmed the stringency of engineered vaccine. The interaction is stable with minimal deviation in root-mean square deviation and root-mean-square fluctuation was confirmed by the molecular dynamics simulation experiment. The immune-simulation by C-ImmSim server, which mimics the natural immune environment, yielded more potent immune response data of B-cells, Th cells, Tc cells and IgG for vaccine. The encouraging data obtained from the various in-silico works indicated this vaccine as an effective therapeutic against COVID-19.","Ojha, Rupal; Gupta, Nidhi; Naik, Biswajit; Singh, Satyendra; Verma, Vijay Kumar; Prusty, Dhaneswar; Prajapati, Vijay Kumar",Eur J Pharm Sci,221,24

STUDY DESIGN: A systematic search related to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), pregnancy, neonatal complications, viral and vertical transmission. The duration was from December 2019 to May 2020. RESULTS: A total of 84 studies with 862 COVID positive women were included. Two studies had ongoing pregnancies while 82 studies included 705 babies, 1 miscarriage and 1 medical termination of pregnancy (MTOP). Most publications (50/84, 59.5%), reported small numbers (<5) of positive babies. From 75 studies, 18 babies were COVID-19 positive. The first reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnostic test was done in 449 babies and 2 losses, 2nd RT-PCR was done in 82 babies, IgM tests were done in 28 babies, and IgG tests were done in 28 babies. On the first RT-PCR, 47 studies reported time of testing while 28 studies did not. Positive results in the first RT-PCR were seen in 14 babies. Earliest tested at birth and the average time of the result was 22 hours. Three babies with negative first RT-PCR became positive on the second RT-PCR at day 6, day 7 and at 24 hours which continued to be positive at 1 week. Four studies with a total of 4 placental swabs were positive demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 localised in the placenta. In 2 studies, 10 tests for amniotic fluid were positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Fourier transforming the time-domain data of infections and fatalities into the frequency domain makes the dynamics easily accessible. Defining a quantity like the case fatality as a spectral density allows a more sensible comparison between different countries and demographics during an ongoing outbreak. Such a case fatality informs not only how many of the confirmed cases end up as fatalities, but also when. For COVID-19, knowing this time and using the entire case fatality spectrum allows determining that an outbreak had entered a steady-state (most likely its end) about 14 days before this is obvious from time-domain data. The lag between confirmations and deaths also helps to estimate the effectiveness of contact management: The larger the lag, the less time the average confirmed person had to infect people before quarantine.","Krewer, K.

OBJECTIVE: The aim is to evaluate the mortality risks associated with CVD and cardiac injury among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, especially in subgroups of populations in different countries. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search was performed using 9 databases from November 1, 2019 to November 9, 2020. Meta-analyses were performed for CVD and cardiac injury between non-survivors and survivors of COVID-19. RESULTS: Although the prevalence of CVD in different populations was different, hospitalized COVID-19 patients with CVD were at a higher risk of fatal outcomes (OR = 2.72; 95% CI 2.35–3.16) than those without CVD. Separate meta-analyses of populations in four different countries also reached a similar conclusion that CVD was associated with an increase in mortality. Cardiac injury was common among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients with cardiac injury had a significantly higher mortality risk than those without cardiac injury (OR = 13.25; 95% CI: 8.56–20.52).

Scholars predict that the pandemic will continue into the coming winter and will become a seasonal epidemic in the following year. Therefore, the identification of effective control measures becomes extremely important. Although many reports have been published since the COVID-19 outbreak, no studies have identified the relative effectiveness of a combination of control measures implemented in Wuhan and other areas in China. To this end, a retrospective analysis by the collection and modeling of an unprecedented number of epidemiology records in China of the early stage of the outbreaks can be valuable. In this study, we developed a new dynamic model to describe the spread of COVID-19 and to quantify the effectiveness of control measures. The transmission rate, daily close contacts, and the average time from onset to isolation were identified as crucial factors in viral spreading. Moreover, the capacity of a local health-care system is identified as a threshold to control an outbreak in its early stage. We took these factors as controlling parameters in our model. The parameters are estimated based on epidemiological reports from national and local Center for Disease Control (CDCs). A retrospective simulation showed the effectiveness of combinations of 4 major control measures implemented in Wuhan: hospital isolation, social distancing, self-protection by wearing masks, and extensive medical testing. Further analysis indicated critical intervention conditions and times required to control an outbreak in the early stage. Our simulations showed that South Korea has kept the spread of COVID-19 at a low level through extensive medical testing. Furthermore, a predictive simulation for Italy indicated that Italy would contain the outbreak in late May under strict social distancing. In our general analysis, no single measure could contain a COVID-19 outbreak once a health-care system is overloaded. Extensive medical testing could keep viral spreading at a low level. Wearing masks functions as favorably as social distancing but with much lower socioeconomic costs.","Yang, Shuhang; Liu, Yu; Chen, Ke; Li, Tong; Huang, Yi; Chen, Xiaolei; Qi, Pengfang; Xu, Yazhi; Yu, Feifei; Yang, Yuling; Chen, Youhua",Medicine (Baltimore),221,1

Hyperactivation of this protein by human coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 has been found to contribute to aberrant complement activation in patients, leading to aggravated lung injury with potentially fatal consequences. This hyperactivation is triggered in the lungs through a conserved, direct interaction between MASP-2 and coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Blocking this interaction with monoclonal antibodies and interfering directly with the catalytic activity of MASP-2, have been found to alleviate coronavirus-induced lung injury both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, a virtual library of 8736 licensed drugs and clinical agents has been screened in silico according to two parallel strategies. The first strategy aims at identifying direct inhibitors of MASP-2 catalytic activity, while the second strategy focusses on finding protein-protein interaction inhibitors (PPIs) of MASP-2 and coronaviral N proteins. Such agents could represent promising support treatment options to prevent lung injury and reduce mortality rates of infections caused by both present and future-emerging coronaviruses. Forty-six drug repurposing candidates were purchased and, for the ones selected as potential direct inhibitors of MASP-2, a preliminary in vitro assay was conducted to assess their interference with the lectin pathway of complement activation. Some of the tested agents displayed a dose-response inhibitory activity of the lectin pathway, potentially providing the basis for a viable support strategy to prevent the severe complications of coronavirus infections.","Flude, Ben M.; Nannetti, Giulio; Mitchell, Paige; Compton, Nina; Richards, Chloe; Heurich, Meike; Brancale, Andrea; Ferla, Salvatore; Bassetto, Marcella",Viruses,221,23

METHODS: A mixed‐methods design, integrating qualitative and quantitative data analyses, was employed to explore a total of 289 patient satisfaction survey ratings and 421 comments based on care that took place in the ED during the initial phase of the COVID‐19 epidemic. This allowed for comparisons to a more typical time period in the ED along with the emergence of novel categories of influence. RESULTS: The ED census was 31% lower during 2020 (COVID‐19) than the previous year, and a significantly greater percentage of patients in 2020 indicated that they would “definitely recommend” the ED compared with 2019. Wait time was mentioned in >40% of dissatisfied patient comments in 2019 but <20% of dissatisfied patient comments in 2020. General negative comments were proportionately greater than general positive comments in 2019, whereas in 2020 the reverse pattern held. Other categories did not differ significantly across 2019 and 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The general circumstances surrounding the early stages of the COVID‐19 pandemic included a lower census in the ED and higher reported satisfaction among patients. A comparison of the content of patient comments revealed less concern about wait times and a more positive overall view toward receiving care during the first 3 months of the pandemic.","Grissom, Maureen O.; Farra, Morgan; Cruzen, Eric S.; Barlow, Erin; Gupta, Sanjey",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,221,16

It presents with the rapid development of pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and cardiogenic shock with the hallmark being microvascular leakage. We report a patient with a history of alcohol abuse and recent exposure to mice and sick kittens who presented with cough with sputum production, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and new-onset lower extremity edema. Imaging revealed bilateral infiltrates more common on the left with an unremarkable echocardiogram. Testing for COVID-19, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), influenza, bacterial pneumonia including tuberculosis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, Blastomyces, and Coccidiodes was negative. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage revealed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and were negative for acid-fast bacilli and Nocardia cultures. He was further tested for Hantavirus, Q fever, leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis, and empiric treatment with doxycycline initiated. His Hantavirus IgM antibody came back positive. Human Hantavirus infection occurs after inhalation of infected rodent excreta; fortunately, human-to-human transmission has not been documented. HCPS most commonly occurs due to the Sin Nombre virus (SNV), has a case fatality rate of 50%, and is a notifiable disease in the United States. It has 3 distinct phases, prodromal, cardiopulmonary, and convalescent/recovery. The cardiopulmonary phase occurs from increased permeability of pulmonary capillaries and in severe cases can progress to cardiogenic shock. Diagnosis is based on the presence of IgM and IgG Hantavirus antibodies. Treatment is mainly supportive; however, patients are usually treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics while workup is underway. In animal models, ribavirin and favipiravir are only effective when administered in the prodromal phase. If suspicion of Hantavirus infection exists, early mobilization to the intensive care unit for treatment is recommended. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been suggested to improve outcomes in severe HCPS with refractory shock.","Hamid, Khizar; Sathyanarayanan, Swaminathan Perinkulam; Naim, Touba; Hamza, Muhammad; Mahmood Baig, Mirza Omer; Sitta, Emad Abu",Case Rep Infect Dis,221,14

OBJECTIVE: This manuscript aims to advance knowledge on COVID-19 preventive perceptions and behaviors and their main predictors, including digital health information–seeking behavior (HISB), political party identification, and COVID-19 testing status. METHODS: Two cross-sectional online surveys of US millennials were conducted from April 10 to 14, 2020 (N=274) (ie, Study 1), and from April 27 to May 7, 2020 (N=1037) (ie, Study 2). In the regression models, dependent variables included preventive behaviors (eg, wearing a face mask and social distancing) as well as four preventive perceptions: severity (ie, a person’s conception of the seriousness of COVID-19), susceptibility (ie, a person’s conception of the likelihood of being infected with COVID-19), self-efficacy (ie, a person’s perception that he or she can wear a face mask and perform social distancing to prevent COVID-19 infection), and response efficacy (ie, a person’s perception of whether wearing a face mask and social distancing can prevent COVID-19 infection). Key independent variables included digital HISB for self, digital HISB for another person, political party identification, and COVID-19 testing status. RESULTS: Millennials reported lower levels of perceived susceptibility than the other three preventive perceptions (ie, severity, self-efficacy, and response efficacy), as well as fairly high levels of preventive behaviors. Unlike HISB for another person, digital HISB for self was positively associated with preventive perceptions and behaviors. In Study 1, respondents with higher levels of digital HISB for self had significantly higher perceptions of severity (β=.22, P<.001), self-efficacy (β=.15, P=.02), and response efficacy (β=.25, P<.001) as well as, at nearing significance, higher perceptions of susceptibility (β=.11, P=.07). In Study 2, respondents with higher levels of digital HISB for self had significantly higher perceptions of severity (β=.25, P<.001), susceptibility (β=.14, P<.001), and preventive behaviors (β=.24, P<.001). Preventive behaviors did not vary significantly according to political party identification, but preventive perceptions did. In Study 1, respondents who identified as being more Republican had significantly lower perceptions of self-efficacy (β=−.14, P=.02) and response efficacy (β=−.13, P=.03) and, at nearing significance, lower perceptions of severity (β=−.10, P=.08) and susceptibility (β=−.12, P=.06). In Study 2, respondents who identified as being more Republican had significantly lower perceptions of severity (β=−.08, P=.009). There were mixed effects of COVID-19 testing status on preventive perceptions, with respondents who had tested positive for COVID-19 having significantly higher perceptions of susceptibility in Study 1 (β=.17, P=.006) and significantly lower perceptions of severity in Study 2 (β=−.012, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: As the largest and most digitally savvy generation, US millennials saw COVID-19 as a severe threat, but one that they were less susceptible to.

Explicit teaching of the hidden curriculum is often lacking in mainstream education classes and can be a tremendous stumbling block for children with HFA. The result is often anxiety and depression which can be exacerbated or sometimes even caused by the intense demands for sociability and flexibility required in most mainstream educational settings. Remote learning, while not a legitimate option until now, has provided these children with an opportunity to flourish at home and improve not only their grades but also their mental health.

Ephedra sinica, one of the major constituent herbs of multi-component herbal formula, has been widely used to treat COVID-19 in China. However, its active components are still unclear. The objectives of this study are to screen and evaluate active components from the traditional Chinese medicine Ephedra sinica for the treatment of COVID-19. In our study, we established an ACE2/CMC bioaffinity chromatography model, and then developed an ACE2/CMC-HPLC-IT-TOF-MS system for the active compounds screening and identification from Ephedra sinica extract. We performed molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays to assess the binding characteristics (binding mode and K(D) value). We used CCK-8 staining to assess the toxicity of screened compounds, and also used SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to observe the viropexis effect of screened compounds in ACE2(h) cells. In this current work, one fraction was fished out, separated and identified as ephedrine (EP), pseudoephedrine (PEP), and methylephedrine (MEP). Binding assays showed that the three compounds could bind with ACE2 in a special way to some amino acid residues, similar to the way SARS-CoV-2 bound with ACE2. Additionally, the three compounds, especially EP, can inhibit the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus into ACE2(h) cells because they can reduce the entrance ratio of pseudovirus in the pseudovirus model. Overall, the ACE2/CMC-HPLC-IT-TOF-MS system was established and verified to be suitable for ACE2-targeted bioactive compound screening. EP, PEP, and MEP with ACE2-binding features were screened out from Ephedra sinica, and acted as blockers inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus entering ACE2(h) cells.

This study aims to determine whether SCD is a risk factor for severe COVID‐19 infection in regard to the requirement of noninvasive ventilation/high flow nasal cannula (NIV/HFNC), mechanical ventilation (MV), or death in hospitalized patients. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study included COVID‐19 patients admitted to four COVID‐19 treatment facilities in Bahrain between February 24, 2020 and July 31, 2020. All SCD patients with COVID‐19 were included and compared to a randomly selected sample of non‐SCD patients with COVID‐19. Data were collected from the medical records. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to control for confounders and estimate the effect of SCD on the outcomes. RESULTS: 1792 patients with COVID‐19 were included; 38 of whom were diagnosed with SCD as well. In the SCD group, one (2.6%) patient required NIV/HFNC, one (2.6%) required MV, and one (2.6%) death occurred. In comparison, 56 (3.2%) of the non‐SCD patients required NIV/HFNC, 47 (2.7%) required MV, and death occurred in 58 (3.3%) patients. Upon adjusting for confounders, SCD had an odds ratio of 1.847 (95% CI: 0.39–8.83; p = 0.442). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that SCD is not a risk factor for worse COVID‐19 outcomes in hospitalized patients.","Abdulrahman, Abdulkarim; Wael, Mohammed; AlAmmadi, Fajer; Almosawi, Zahra; Alsherooqi, Reem; Abduljalil, Manal; Kumar, Nitya; AlQahtani, Manaf",EJHaem,221,16

Antipsychotics are usually used for the pharmacological management of delirium, and confusion and behavioral disturbances. The concurrent use of treatments for COVID-19 and antipsychotics should consider eventual drug-drug interactions OBJECTIVE: To systematically review evidence-based available on drug-drug interactions between COVID-19 treatments and antipsychotics. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Three databases were consulted: Lexicomp® Drug Interactions, Micromedex® Solutions Drugs Interactions, and Liverpool© Drug Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies. To acquire more information on QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointes (TdP), the CredibleMeds® QTDrugs List was searched. The authors made a recommendation agreed to by consensus. Additionally, a systematic review of drug-drug interactions between antipsychotics and COVID-19 treatment was conducted. RESULTS: The main interactions between COVID-19 drugs and antipsychotics are the risk of QT-prolongation and TdP, and cytochromes P450 interactions. Remdesivir, baricinitib, and anakinra can be used concomitantly with antipsychotics without risk of drug-drug interaction (except for hematological risk with clozapine and baricinitib). Favipiravir only needs caution with chlorpromazine and quetiapine. Tocilizumab is rather safe to use in combination with antipsychotics. The most demanding COVID-19 treatments for coadministration with antipsychotics are chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir because of the risk of QT prolongation and TdP and cytochromes interactions. The systematic review provides highly probable drug interaction between lopinavir/ritonavir plus quetiapine and ritonavir/indinavir plus risperidone. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians prescribing antipsychotics should be aware of the likely risk of drug-drug interaction with COVID-19 medication and may benefit from taking into account present recommendations of use to preserve patient safety SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00213-020-05716-4.","Plasencia-García, Beatriz Oda; Rodríguez-Menéndez, Gonzalo; Rico-Rangel, María Isabel; Rubio-García, Ana; Torelló-Iserte, Jaime; Crespo-Facorro, Benedicto",Psychopharmacology (Berl),221,16

However, no data exist on the effect of LTBI on the immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 co-infected individuals. METHODS: : We examined the SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses, plasma cytokines, chemokines, acute phase proteins and growth factor levels in LTBI positive and negative individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: : Our results demonstrated that individuals with LTBI (LTBI+) and seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were associated with elevated SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies, as well as enhanced neutralization activity compared to those negative for LTBI (LTBI-) individuals. Our results also demonstrate that LTBI+ individuals exhibited significantly higher plasma levels of IFNγ, IL-2, TNFα, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17, IL-3, GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-25, IL-33, CCL3 and CXCL10 compared to LTBI- individuals. Finally, our results show that LTBI+ individuals exhibit significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein, alpha-2 macroglobulin, VEGF and TGFα compared to LTBI- individuals. CONCLUSIONS: : Thus, our data clearly demonstrates that LTBI+ individuals seropositive for SARS-CoV2 infection exhibit heightened levels of humoral, cytokine and acute phase responses compared to LTBI- individuals. Thus, LTBI is associated with modulation of antibody and cytokine responses as well as systemic inflammation in individuals seropositive for SARS-CoV2 infection.","Rajamanickam, Anuradha; Kumar, Nathella Pavan; Padmapriyadarsini, C; Nancy, Arul; Selvaraj, Nandhini; Karunanithi, Kushiyasri; Munisankar, Saravanan; BM, Shrinivasa; Renji, Rachel Mariam; Ambu, T.C; V, Vijayalakshmi; Babu, Subash",J Infect,221,16

The causal coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) binds host cells via a trimeric Spike whose receptor binding domain (RBD) recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), initiating conformational changes that drive membrane fusion. We find that monoclonal antibody CR3022 binds the RBD tightly, neutralising SARS-CoV-2 and report the crystal structure at 2.4 Å of the Fab/RBD complex. Some crystals are suitable for screening for entry-blocking inhibitors. The highly conserved, structure-stabilising, CR3022 epitope is inaccessible in the prefusion Spike, suggesting that CR3022 binding would facilitate conversion to the fusion-incompetent post-fusion state. Cryo-EM analysis confirms that incubation of Spike with CR3022 Fab leads to destruction of the prefusion trimer. Presentation of this cryptic epitope in an RBD-based vaccine might advantageously focus immune responses.

Here, we share our initial experience of head and neck cancer surgery in a COVID-19 tertiary care centre, emphasizing the evolved protocol of perioperative care when compared to pre-COVID-19 times. This was a prospective study of 21 patients with head and neck cancers undergoing surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to 193 historical controls. Changes in anaesthesia, surgery, and operating room practices were evaluated. A strict protocol was followed. One patient tested positive for COVID-19 preoperatively. There was a significant increase in pre-induction tracheostomies (28.6% vs 6.7%, P = 0.005), median hospital stay (10 vs 7 days, P = 0.001), and postponements of surgery (57.1% vs 27.5%, P = 0.01), along with a significant decrease in flap reconstructions (33.3% vs 59.6%, P = 0.03). There was no mortality and no difference in postoperative morbidity. No healthcare personnel became symptomatic for COVID-19 during this period.

This study seeks to analyze the perceptions of residency program directors (PDs) and associate program directors (APDs) regarding the current virtual format used for residency selection and interviews. METHODS: An anonymous, 30-question survey was constructed and sent to 115 neurosurgery PDs and 26 APDs to assess respondent demographics, factors used to review applicants, perceptions of applicants and applicant engagement, perceptions of standardized letters and interview questions, the effect of the virtual interview format on various stakeholders, and the future outlook for the virtual residency interview format. RESULTS: A total of 38 PDs and APDs completed this survey, constituting a response rate of 27.0%. Survey respondents received significantly more Electronic Residency Application Service applications in the 2020–2021 cycle compared with the 2019-2020 cycle (P = 0.0029).

DNA composed of 7-deaza-2′-deoxyguanosine 5′-triphosphate (c(7)dGTP), an analog of deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP), is resistant to selective restriction enzymes. This characteristic has been utilized to develop a novel strategy for target enrichment in next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: The new enrichment strategy is named target enrichment via enzymatic digestion in next-generation sequencing (TEEDseq). It combined 7-deaza-2′-deoxyguanosine 5′-triphosphate (c(7)dGTP)-involved primer extension, splinter-assisted intracellular cyclization, c(7)dGTP)-resistant enzymatic digestion, and two-phase rolling cycle amplification. We first estimated c7dGTP for its efficiency in PCR amplification and its resistance to three restriction enzymes, AluI, HaeIII, and HpyCH4V. We then evaluated TEEDseq using a serum sample spiked with a 1311-bp hepatitis B virus (HBV) fragment. TEEDseq achieved an HBV on-target rate of 3.31 ± 0.39%, which was equivalent to 454× the enrichment of direct Illumina sequencing. Therefore, the current study has provided a concept proof for TEEDseq as an alternative option for clinical viral sequencing that requires an enrichment in next-generation sequencing.","Peng, Peng; Xu, Yanjuan; Di Bisceglie, Adrian M.; Fan, Xiaofeng",BMC Res Notes,221,1

In the first half of 2020, governments limited the spread of virus by imposing diverse regulations. These regulations had a particular impact on families as parents had to manage their occupational situation and childcare in parallel. Here, we examine a variation in parents' and children's stress during the lockdowns in the first half of 2020 and detect the correlates of families' stress. Between April and June 2020, we conducted an explorative online survey among n = 422 parents of 3- to 10-year-old children residing in 17 countries. Most participants came from Germany (n = 274), Iran (n = 70), UK (n = 23), and USA (n = 23). Parents estimated their own stress, the stress of their own children, and various information on potential correlates (e.g., accommodation, family constellation, education, community size, playtime for children, contact with peers, media consumption, and physical activity). Parents also stated personal values regarding openness to change, self-transcendence, self-enhancement, and conservation. The results indicate a substantial variation in the stress levels of families and their diverse reactions to regulations. Media consumption by children commonly increased in comparison to the time before the pandemic. Parents raising both pre-school- and school-aged children were at a particular risk of experiencing stress in response to regulations. Estimated stress and reactions varied with the age of children and the personal values of parents, suggesting that such variables need to be considered when implementing and evaluating regulations and supporting young families in the current and future pandemic.","Toppe, Theo; Stengelin, Roman; Schmidt, Louisa S.; Amini, Naiera; Schuhmacher, Nils",Front Psychol,221,16

Altered zinc turnover may be also involved in depressed TTA efficiency. Zinc turnover is under the control of zinc-bound metallothioneins (Zn-MTs) synthesis. Thyroid hormones, corticosterone and nutritional zinc affect Zn-MT induction. Zn-MT releases zinc in young-adult age during transient oxidative stress for prompt immune response. In constant oxidative stress (ageing and liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy), high liver Zn-MTs, low zinc ion bioavailability and depressed TTA efficiency appear. This last finding suggested that MT might not release zinc during constant oxidative stress leading to impaired TTA efficiency. The aim of this work/study is to clarify the role of Zn-MTs (I+II) in TTA efficiency during development and ageing. The main results are (1) Old and PTU mice display high corticosterone, enhanced liver MTmRNA, low zinc and depressed TTA efficiency restored by zinc supply. Increased survival and no significant increments in basal liver Zn-MTs proteins occur in old and PTU mice after zinc supply. (2) Lot of zinc ions bound with MT in the liver from old mice than young (HPLC). (3) Young-adult Tx mice, evaluated at 15 days from thymectomy, display high MTmRNA and nutritional–endocrine–immune damage restored by zinc supply or by thymus grafts from old zinc-treated mice. (4) Young-adult Tx mice, but evaluated at 40 days from thymectomy, display natural normalisation in MTmRNA and nutritional–endocrine–immune profile with survival similar to normal mice. (5) Stressed (constant dark for 10 days) mice overexpressing MT display low zinc, depressed immunity, reduced thymic cortex, high corticosterone, altered thyroid hormones turnover showing a likeness with old mice. These findings, taken altogether, show that corticosterone is pivotal in MTs induction under stress. MTs bind preferentially zinc ions in constant oxidative stress, but with no release of zinc from MT leading to impaired TTA efficiency. Zinc supply restores the defect because zinc has no interference in affecting pre-existing Zn-MTs protein concentrations in old and PTU mice. Therefore, free zinc ions are available for TTA efficiency after zinc supply. Thymus from old zinc-treated mice induces the same restoring effect when transplanted in Tx recipients. However, Tx mice display natural normalisation in MTmRNA and in nutritional–endocrine–immune profile in the long run.

The TREC-COVID Challenge was created to evaluate information retrieval methods and systems for this quickly expanding corpus. Based on the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), several dozen research teams participated in over 5 rounds of the TREC-COVID Challenge. While previous work has compared IR techniques used on other test collections, there are no studies that have analyzed the methods used by participants in the TREC-COVID Challenge. We manually reviewed team run reports from Rounds 2 and 5, extracted features from the documented methodologies, and used a univariate and multivariate regression-based analysis to identify features associated with higher retrieval performance. We observed that fine-tuning datasets with relevance judgments, MS-MARCO, and CORD-19 document vectors was associated with improved performance in Round 2 but not in Round 5. Though the relatively decreased heterogeneity of runs in Round 5 may explain the lack of significance in that round, fine-tuning has been found to improve search performance in previous challenge evaluations by improving a system's ability to map relevant queries and phrases to documents. Furthermore, term expansion was associated with improvement in system performance, and the use of the narrative field in the TREC-COVID topics was associated with decreased system performance in both rounds. These findings emphasize the need for clear queries in search. While our study has some limitations in its generalizability and scope of techniques analyzed, we identified some IR techniques that may be useful in building search systems for COVID-19 using the TREC-COVID test collections.","Chen, J.; Hersh, W.",,221,12

Often with insufficient human and electronic resources, patients need to be checked from stable patients using vital signs, radiographic photographs, or ultrasound images. Vital signs do not often offer the right outcome, and radiographic photos have a variety of other problems. Lung ultrasound (LUS) images can provide good screening without a lot of complications. This paper suggests a model of a convolutionary neural network (CNN) that has fewer learning parameters but can achieve strong accuracy. The model has five main blocks or layers of convolution connectors. A multi-layer fusion functionality of each block is proposed to improve the efficiency of the COVID-19 screening method utilizing the proposed model. Experiments are conducted using freely accessible LUS photographs and video datasets. The proposed fusion method has 92.5% precision, 91.8% accuracy, and 93.2% retrieval using the data collection.

METHODS: We undertook a systematic review characterising the proportion and causes of severe maternal morbidity in the Asia Pacific region. We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL library and the World Health Organization Western Pacific Index database for studies in the Asia-Pacific reporting maternal morbidity/near miss using a predefined search strategy. We included cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies published in English before September 2020. A meta-analysis was performed calculating the overall proportion of near miss events by sub-region, country, near miss definition, economic status, setting and cause using a random-effects model. FINDINGS: We identified 26,232 articles, screened 24,306 and retrieved 454 full text articles. Of these, 197 studies spanning 27 countries were included. 13 countries in the region were not represented. There were 30,183,608 pregnancies and 100,011 near misses included. The total proportion of near miss events was 4•4 (95% CI 4•3-4•5) per 1000 total births. The greatest proportion of near misses were found in the Western Pacific region (around Papua New Guinea) at 11•8 per 1000 births (95% CI 6•6-17•1; I(2) 96.05%). Low-income countries displayed the greatest proportion of near misses (13•4, 95% CI 6•0-20•7), followed by lower-middle income countries (11•1; 95% CI 10•4 - 11•9). High-income countries had the lowest proportion (2•2, 95% CI 2•1-2•3). Postpartum haemorrhage was the most common near miss event (5•9, 95% CI 4•5-7•2), followed by eclampsia (2•7, 95% CI 2•4 – 2•9). INTERPRETATION: There is a high burden of severe maternal morbidity in the Asia-Pacific. LMICs are disproportionately affected. Most of the common causes are preventable. This provides an opportunity to implement targeted interventions which could have major clinical impact.","De Silva, Manarangi; Panisi, Leeanne; Lindquist, Anthea; Cluver, Catherine; Middleton, Anna; Koete, Benjamin; Vogel, Joshua P.; Walker, Susan; Tong, Stephen; Hastie, Roxanne",Lancet Reg Health West Pac,221,26

Biological plausibility for infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 exists in testis, ovaries, and placenta as they express ACE2 receptor activity. In males, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection could lead to functional abnormalities leading to spermatogenic failure and male infertility. In females, an alteration of the ACE2 cascade via SARS‐CoV‐2 infection could lead to impairment in important follicular and luteal processes. There is also evidence of significant placental pathology in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, but it is unclear what effects there may be for early pregnancy, though available data suggest less severe effects compared to other respiratory virus outbreaks.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether anxiety and fear related to COVID-19 are influenced by sociodemographics and whether specific conditions, such as positivity for COVID-19 or death among relatives and friends, can further enhance these symptoms. In this cross-sectional study, 697 Italians responded to an online survey assessing sociodemographic information, the presence/absence of positive cases, or deaths due to COVID-19 among relatives or acquaintances. The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) and Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCS-19S) were administered in order to assess the levels of anxiety and fear associated with COVID-19. The data were collected in November 2020. Anxiety and fear scores were positively correlated. Both male and female subjects with higher CAS scores also displayed higher FCS-19S scores. The CAS and FCS-19S scores tended to increase with age, with older subjects exhibiting higher scores than younger subjects. Additionally, respondents with lower educational levels demonstrated higher scores on both the CAS and FCS-19S. Similarly, respondents living with older people and/or experiencing the death of one or more relatives due to COVID-19 exhibited corresponding outcomes. This study demonstrates how the levels of anxiety and fear, measured by CAS and FCS-19S associated with COVID-19, are influenced by gender, age, cohabitation status, educational levels, and the presence of positive cases or deaths due to COVID-19.","Orrù, Graziella; Bertelloni, Davide; Diolaiuti, Francesca; Conversano, Ciro; Ciacchini, Rebecca; Gemignani, Angelo",Front Psychol,221,17

Methods We retrospectively reviewed 148 chest CT scans of oncological patients who were referred to the Radiological Unit of Policlinico S. Marco from 1 February 2020 to 30 April 2020, during the COVID-19 outbreak in Bergamo area. In parallel, we analyzed RT-PCR tests of these 148 patients. Results Among 32 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19, 17 patients were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms (53.1%), while 15 developed severe disease (46.8%). The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 22.9%, the mortality rate was 18.8%. We did not find any correlation between disease severity and age, sex, smoking, or cardiovascular comorbidities. Remarkably, patients who were on treatment for cancer developed a milder disease than patients who were not on treatment. Conclusions The acceptance of CT-defined diagnoses in COVID-19 high-incidence areas like Bergamo region highlighted a larger oncological population affected by COVID-19 than RT-PCR, in particular, asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients, because only symptomatic patients underwent nasopharyngeal swabbing at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed that patients actively treated for their cancer had a milder disease, in agreement with previous studies that suggested a protective role of immunosuppression. Admittedly, the sample of patients in our study was heterogeneous regarding the oncological disease, their prognosis, and the type of treatment; therefore, other studies are needed to confirm our data.","Martini, Francesca; D’Alessio, Andrea; Bracchi, Federico; Di Mauro, Daniela; Fargnoli, Anna; Motta, Marco; Giussani, Cristina; Meazza Prina, Marco; Gobbin, Giovanni; Taverna, Monica",J Clin Med,221,24

Aim: To conduct a preliminary study on the establishment of a temporary integrated isolation ward during the outbreak of COVID-19 and to evaluate related impact. Methods: SWOT analysis was used to analyze the advantages, disadvantages, opportunities, and risks in the establishment of the temporary integrated isolation ward, and corresponding corrective measures were made according to the analysis results. Findings: The ward has formulated more than 10 related work procedures and prevention and control measures. A total of 93 patients with 18 critically ill patients were admitted for treatment and isolation. They were all evaluated based on established procedures and protocols. Twenty-four supplementary nucleic acid tests were ordered and conducted. One new patient with COVID-19 was confirmed and was successfully transferred to the designated COVID-19 infectious control hospital. There were no missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis, no cross-infection of patients, no cluster outbreak, and no infection of medical workers during the entire process. Conclusion: SWOT analysis is helpful in guiding the establishment of a temporary integrated isolation ward and the formulation of prevention and control measures in Hebei General Hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak. It provides the guidance and reference of significance for the establishment of similar types of wards in the future.","Zhou, Ye; Bai, Lixiang; Guo, Hao; Guo, Shaowei; Han, Xiaowen; Yue, Ning J.; Li, Qingxia",Front Public Health,221,16

The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) warrants the need for a maximum coverage vaccine. Moreover, mutations that arise within the virus have a significant impact on the vaccination strategy. Here, we built a comprehensive in silico workflow pipeline to identify B-cell- and T-cell-stimulating antigens of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. Our in silico reverse vaccinology (RV) approach consisted of two parts: (1) analysis of the selected viral proteins based on annotated cellular location, antigenicity, allele coverage, epitope density, and mutation density and (2) analysis of the various aspects of the epitopes, including antigenicity, allele coverage, IFN-γ induction, toxicity, host homology, and site mutational density. After performing a mutation analysis based on the contemporary mutational amino acid substitutions observed in the viral variants, 13 potential epitopes were selected as subunit vaccine candidates. Despite mutational amino acid substitutions, most epitope sequences were predicted to retain immunogenicity without toxicity and host homology. Our RV approach using an in silico pipeline may potentially reduce the time required for effective vaccine development and can be applicable for vaccine development for other pathogenic diseases as well.","Hisham, Yasmin; Ashhab, Yaqoub; Hwang, Sang-Hyun; Kim, Dong-Eun",Viruses,221,1

During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, NYC was the first major US city to open schools for in-person learning in the 2020-2021 academic year. Several policies were implemented to reduce the risk of in-school transmission, including infection control measures (facemasks, physical distancing, enhanced indoor ventilation, cohorting of small groups, and hand hygiene), option of all-remote instruction, alternative options for how class schedules would rotate in-person and remote instruction, daily symptom screening, and testing 10-20% of students and staff weekly or monthly depending on local case rates. We sought to determine which of these policies had the greatest impact on reducing the risk of in-school transmission. Methods We evaluated the impact of each policy by referring to global benchmarks for the secondary attack rate (SAR) of SARS-CoV-2 in school settings and by simulating the potential for transmission in NYC's rotating cohort schedules, in which teachers could act as ""bridges"" across rotating cohorts. We estimated the impact of (1) infection control measures, (2) providing an option of all-remote instruction, (3) choice of class scheduling for in-person learners, (4) daily symptom screening, (5) testing to curtail transmission, and (6) testing to identify school outbreaks. Each policy was assessed independently of other policies, with the exception of symptom screening and random testing, which were assessed both independently and jointly. Results Among the policies analyzed, the greatest transmission reduction was associated with the infection control measures, followed by small class cohorts with an option for all-remote instruction, symptom screening, and finally randomly testing 10-20% of school attendees. Assuming adult staff are the primary source of within-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission, weekly testing of staff could be at least as effective as symptom screening, and potentially more so if testing days occur in the beginning of the workweek with results available by the following day. A combination of daily symptom screening and testing on the first workday of each week could reduce transmission by 70%. Conclusions Adherence to infection control is the highest priority for safe school re-opening. Further transmission reduction can be achieved through small rotating class cohorts with an option for remote learning, widespread testing at the beginning of the work week, and daily symptom screening and self-isolation. Randomly testing 10-20% of attendees weekly or monthly does not meaningfully curtail transmission and may not detect outbreaks before they have spread beyond a handful of individuals. School systems considering re-opening during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic or similarly virulent respiratory disease outbreaks should consider these relative impacts when setting policy priorities.","Bershteyn, A.; Kim, H.-Y.; McGillen, J.

This has allowed building several kinds of relationships that have promoted different emotions in human societies. The objective of this review was to identify the main emotions that humans show toward wildlife species and the impact of such emotions on animal population management. We reviewed academic databases to identify previous studies on this topic worldwide. An analysis of the emotions on wildlife and factors causing them is described in this study. We identified a controversy about these emotions. Large predators such as wolves, coyotes, bears, big felids, and reptiles, such as snakes and geckos, promote mainly anger, fear, and disgust. This is likely due to the perceptions, beliefs, and experiences that societies have historically built around them. However, in some social groups these animals have promoted emotions such as happiness due to their values for people. Likewise, sadness is an emotion expressed for the threatening situations that animals are currently facing. Furthermore, we associated the conservation status of wildlife species identified in the study with human emotions to discuss their relevance for emerging conservation strategies, particularly focused on endangered species promoting ambiguous emotions in different social groups.","Castillo-Huitrón, Nathalia M.; Naranjo, Eduardo J.; Santos-Fita, Dídac; Estrada-Lugo, Erin",Front Psychol,221,1

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed on COVID-19 patients referred to Medical Imaging Centers of Sari, Mazandaran, Iran, on March 2020 for computed tomography (CT) scan. Symptomatic patients were referred to the Medical Imaging Center for diagnosis confirmation through CT scan. In addition to age and sex, HRCT findings were collected from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) for further evaluations. RESULTS: Out of 552 patients with mean age of 51.2 ± 14.8 years, the male/female ratio was 1.38 to 1. The most common expressive findings in patients were ground-glass opacity (GGO) (87.3%), peripheral distribution (82.4%), and posterior distribution (81.5%). The most conflicting findings in patients were pleural effusion (7.6%), peribronchovascular distribution (7.6%), and lymphadenopathy (5.1%). The peripheral distribution (p = 0.034), round opacities (p = 0.02), single lobe (p = 0.003), and pleural effusion (p = 0.037) were significant in people under and over 50 years of age.

METHODS: We analyzed French national data from three networks: emergency departments (ED) of French hospitals, general practitioners (GP), and hospital laboratories. We compared the number of ED or GP visits for bronchiolitis in children <2 years of age, and the percentage of RSV positive tests in the 2020 to 2021 season with those of the two previous seasons (2018-2019 and 2019-2020). We used time series of the previous 5 years to calculate epidemic thresholds. RESULTS: During the 2020-2021 season, the epidemic begun in February (Week 05) in the Ile de France (Paris and suburbs) region, 12 weeks later compared with the previous seasons and progressively spread across all the French metropolitan regions. The highest number of bronchiolitis cases in 2021 (Week 12) occurred 10-12 weeks after the previous seasonal peaks of previous seasons, but the number of cases remained lower than in the previous seasonal peaks. CONCLUSION: We identified a delayed RSV epidemic in the period that usually corresponds at the end of the epidemic season, raising concerns for the burden of RSV in the already strained healthcare systems during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Delestrain, Céline; Danis, Kostas; Hau, Isabelle; Behillil, Sylvie; Billard, Marie-Noëlle; Krajten, Leyla; Cohen, Robert; Bont, Louis; Epaud, Ralph",Pediatr. pulmonol,221,21

Consumer-grade wearables may present a solution to detect the presence of infections in the population, but the current paradigm requires collecting physiological data continuously and for long periods of time on each individual, which poses limitations in the context of rapid screening. Technology: Here, we propose a novel paradigm based on recording the physiological responses elicited by a short (~2 minutes) sequence of activities (i.e. “snapshot”), to detect symptoms associated with COVID-19. We employed a novel body-conforming soft wearable sensor placed on the suprasternal notch to capture data on physical activity, cardio-respiratory function, and cough sounds. Results: We performed a pilot study in a cohort of individuals (n=14) who tested positive for COVID-19 and detected altered heart rate, respiration rate and heart rate variability, relative to a group of healthy individuals (n=14) with no known exposure. Logistic regression classifiers were trained on individual and combined sets of physiological features (heartbeat and respiration dynamics, walking cadence, and cough frequency spectrum) at discriminating COVID-positive participants from the healthy group. Combining features yielded an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI=[0.92, 0.96]) using a leave-one-subject-out cross validation scheme. Conclusions and Clinical Impact: These results, although preliminary, suggest that a sensor-based snapshot paradigm may be a promising approach for non-invasive and repeatable testing to alert individuals that need further screening.",,IEEE J Transl Eng Health Med,221,22

With this target, the current study traced the evolutionary route and mutational frequency of 198 Bangladesh-originated SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences available in the GISAID platform over a period of 13 weeks as of 14 July 2020. The analyses were performed using MEGA X, Swiss Model Repository, Virus Pathogen Resource and Jalview visualization. Our analysis identified that majority of the circulating strains strikingly differ from both the reference genome and the first sequenced genome from Bangladesh. Mutations in nonspecific proteins (NSP2-3, NSP-12(RdRp), NSP-13(Helicase)), S-Spike, ORF3a, and N-Nucleocapsid protein were common in the circulating strains with varying degrees and the most unique mutations (UM) were found in NSP3 (UM-18). But no or limited changes were observed in NSP9, NSP11, Envelope protein (E) and accessory factors (NSP7a, ORF 6, ORF7b) suggesting the possible conserved functions of those proteins in SARS-CoV-2 propagation. However, along with D614G mutation, more than 20 different mutations in the Spike protein were detected basically in the S2 domain. Besides, mutations in SR-rich region of N protein and P323L in RDRP were also present. However, the mutation accumulation showed a significant association (p = 0.003) with sex and age of the COVID-19-positive cases. So, identification of these mutational accumulation patterns may greatly facilitate vaccine development deciphering the age and the sex-dependent differential susceptibility to COVID-19.

Studies on temporal dynamics of its shedding suggests it peaks 1–2 days prior to any symptom onset. Therefore, a large proportion of patients are actively spreading the disease unknowingly whilst undetected. However, lengthy lockdowns and isolation leads to a host of socioeconomic issues and are impractical. Conversely, there exists no study describing this group and their clinical significance despite their key role in disease transmission. METHODS: As a result, we devised a retrospective study to look at the prevalence of presymptomatic patients with COVID-19 from data sourced via our medical records office. Subsequently, we identify early indicators of infection through demographic information, biochemical and radiological abnormalities which would allow early diagnosis and isolation. In addition, we will look into the clinical significance of this group and their outcome; if it differs from asymptomatic or symptomatic patients. Descriptive statistics were used in addition to tabulating the variables and corresponding values for reference. Variables are compared between the presymptomatic group and others via Chi-square testing and Fisher’s exact test, accepting a p value of < 0.05 as significant. RESULTS: Our analysis shows a higher proportion of presymptomatic patients with atypical symptoms like chest pain while symptomatic patients commonly present with respiratory symptoms like cough and shortness of breath. Besides that, there were more females presenting as presymptomatic patients compared to males (p = 0.019) and these group of patients were likely to receive treatment (p < 0.001). Otherwise, we were not able to identify other statistically significant markers suggesting a patient is presymptomatic. CONCLUSION: As we have little means of identifying these silent spreaders, it highlights further the importance of general measures implemented to stop COVID-19 transmission like social distancing, face mask, and widespread testing.","Tan, Juen Kiem; Leong, Dalleen; Munusamy, Hemalatha; Zenol Ariffin, Nor Hazwani; Kori, Najma; Hod, Rozita; Periyasamy, Petrick",BMC Infect Dis,221,5

Mucormycosis is a fatal fungal condition affecting immunocompromised patients caused by a group of mold mucoromycetes. Candida albicans (C. albicans) is an oral commensal present in almost 40–65% of healthy oral cavities in adults. Several cases of mucormycosis and oral candidiasis have been reported lately in COVID-19 patients, and it may elevate the associated risks of morbidity and mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles were taken from a period of 2020 to April 2021 using search sources such as Cochrane, PubMed, Fungiscope and Mycobank using keywords mucormycosis, Black fungus, oral candidiasis, white fungus, COVID-19, Sars-Cov-2. DISCUSSION: The development of oral mucocutaneous lesions, such as mucormycosis and candidiasis in COVID-19 patients could be due to inhaling spores resulting in pulmonary and/or sinus congestion and prolonged mechanical ventilation in the ICU settings and the long-term use of broad-spectrum antibiotics respectively. The onset of candidiasis after the emergence of COVID-19 clinical signs and symptoms varied considerably and is reported within 1–30 days in most of the cases reported in the literature. Biofilms present on the denture surfaces are predisposing factors to oral candidiasis. We aim to summarize the limited data available regarding diagnosis, clinical presentation, and therapeutic approaches for the management of Mucormycosis and oral candidiasis in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Careful monitoring of oral lesions should be instituted through interdisciplinary telemedicine and teleconsultation to aid in primary diagnosis, thereby avoiding personal attendance during the pandemic. Dental practitioners should be included among the interdisciplinary teams for exhaustive intraoral examination and reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality.","Nambiar, Manjusha; Varma, Sudhir Rama; Jaber, Mohamed; Sreelatha, S.

As FIP is an immune-mediated disease, treatment is mainly aimed at controlling the immune response triggered by the infection with the feline coronavirus (FCoV). Immune suppressive drugs such as prednisone or cyclophosphamide may slow disease progression but do not produce a cure. In nearly every published case report of attempted therapy for clinical FIP, glucocorticoids have been used; there are, however, no controlled studies that evaluate the effect of glucocorticoids as a therapy for FIP. Some veterinarians prescribe immune modulators to treat cats with FIP with no documented controlled evidence of efficacy. It has been suggested that these agents may benefit infected animals by restoring compromised immune function, thereby allowing the patient to control viral burden and recover from clinical signs. However, a non-specific stimulation of the immune system may be contraindicated as clinical signs develop and progress as a result of an immune-mediated response to the mutated FCoV.","Hartmann, Katrin; Ritz, Susanne",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,221,16

Here, we present, for the first time to our knowledge, evidence of cross-species infection of a virophage. We demonstrated that challenging the native population of Guarani virophage with two previously unidentified giant viruses, previously nonpermissive to this virophage, allows the selection of a mutant genotype able to infect these giant viruses. We were able to characterize the potential genetic determinant (deletion) carried by the virophage with the expanded-host range. Our study also highlights the relevant biological impact of this host adaptation by demonstrating that coinfection with the mixture containing the mutant virophage abolishes giant virus production and rescues the host cell population from lysis.","Mougari, Said; Chelkha, Nisrine; Sahmi-Bounsiar, Dehia; Di Pinto, Fabrizio; Colson, Philippe; Abrahao, Jonatas; La Scola, Bernard",Commun Biol,221,28

We investigated how prior COVID-19 affects SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and how such knowledge could facilitate frugal vaccination strategies. METHODS: In a cohort of 41 healthcare professionals with (n=14) and without (n=27) previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, we assessed the immune status before, during and after vaccination with BNT162b2. The humoral immune response was assessed by receptor binding domain ELISA and different SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays using wildtype and pseudo-typed viruses. T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 surface and nucleocapsid peptides were studied using interferon-γ release assays and intracellular flow cytometry. Vaccine-related side effects were captured. FINDINGS: Prior COVID-19 resulted in improved vaccine responses both in the B and T cell compartment. In vaccine recipients with prior COVID-19, the first vaccine dose induced high antibody concentrations comparable to seronegative vaccine recipients after two injections. This translated into more efficient neutralisation of virus particles, even more pronounced than expected from the RBD ELISA results. Furthermore, T cell responses were stronger in convalescents and particularly strong against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. INTERPRETATION: Herein, we corroborate recent findings suggesting that in convalescents a single vaccine dose is sufficient to boost adequate in vitro neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 and therefore may be sufficient to induce adequate protection against severe COVID-19. New spike mutated virus variants render the highly conserved nucleocapsid protein – eliciting strong SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell immunity – an interesting additional vaccine target.

METHODS: Data from the Understanding America Study are used to describe group differences in reports of psychological distress and somatic symptoms. Logistic and negative binomial regression models are used to examine whether these differences persist after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and prepandemic health conditions. To understand within-group differences in caregiving demands, the intensity of care provided by short-term and long-term caregivers, as well as selected patients’ health conditions are summarized. RESULTS: Adults’ mental and physical health varied substantially by caregiver status. Caregivers continued to fare worse than noncaregivers in terms of mental health and fatigue, and long-term caregivers were more likely to report headache, body aches, and abdominal discomfort than both short-term caregivers and noncaregivers, net of controls. The nature of caregiving differed between short-term and long-term caregivers, with the latter more likely to provide greater hours of care, and to be looking after patients with permanent medical conditions.

To present a methodology for the simultaneous setting of quantitative targets that reflect both an improvement in the national average of an indicator for Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3), as well as a reduction in its geographic inequality. METHODS. A five-step algorithm was developed: (a) calculate the national average annual percent change (AAPC) for an SDG3 indicator; (b) normatively define geographic strata from the subnational distribution of the indicator in a baseline year; (c) apply a proportional progressivity criterion to the AAPC to project the stratum-specific indicator value for the target year; (d) set the national target as the weighted average of the indicator in the subnational territorial units for the target year; and (e) set the inequality reduction targets by calculating the absolute and relative gaps between the bottom and top strata for the target year. RESULTS. The algorithm was applied to SDG indicator 3.1.1 (maternal mortality ratio, MMR), disaggregated by Guatemala’s 22 departments at the baseline year 2014 (MMR = 113 per 100,000 live births). By sustaining the AAPC rate attained from 2009 to 2014 (-4.3%) and focalizing its actions with territorial progressivity, by 2030 the country could reduce its MMR to 53 per 100,000 and its absolute and relative inequality gaps by 72% and 48%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. The proposed methodology allows for simultaneously setting targets for overall progress and inequality reduction in health, making explicit the primacy of the equity principle contained in the SDG commitment to leave no one behind, whose urgency takes on renewed relevance in the current pandemic scenario.","Sanhueza, Antonio; Espinosa, Isabel; Mújica, Oscar J.; da Silva Jr., Jarbas Barbosa",Rev Panam Salud Publica,221,18

The application of these approaches is usually feasible and effective when performed by healthcare professionals with specific expertise and skills and when data and resources are easily accessible. Contrariwise, in the field situation where healthcare workers or first responders from heterogeneous competences can be asked to investigate an outbreak of unknown origin, a simple and suitable tool for rapid agent identification and appropriate outbreak management is highly needed. Most especially when time is limited, available data are incomplete, and accessible infrastructure and resources are inadequate. The use of a prompt, user-friendly, and accessible tool able to rapidly recognize an infectious disease outbreak and with high sensitivity and precision may be a game-changer to support emergency response and public health investigations. Methods: This paper presents the work performed to implement and test an innovative tool for prompt identification of infectious diseases during outbreaks, called Infectious Diseases Seeker (IDS). IDS is a standalone software that runs on the most common operative systems. It has been built by integrating a database containing an interim set of 60 different disease causative agents and COVID-19 data and is able to work in an off-line mode without requiring a network connection. Results: IDS has been applied in a real and complex scenario in terms of concomitant infectious diseases (yellow fever, COVID-19, and Lassa fever), as can be in the second part of 2020 in Nigeria. The outcomes have allowed inferring that yellow fever (YF), and not Lassa fever, was affecting the area under investigation. Conclusions: Our result suggests that a tool like IDS could be valuable for the quick and easy identification and discrimination of infectious disease outbreaks even when concurrent outbreaks occur, like for the case study of YF and COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.","Baldassi, Federico; Carestia, Mariachiara; Moramarco, Stefania; Malizia, Andrea; Gaudio, Pasquale",Int J Environ Res Public Health,221,16

Deep learning (DL) has made significant advances in the medical industry, including the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, computerized tomography (CT) scans, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) to detect life-threatening diseases, including heart disease, cancer, and brain tumors. However, more advancement in the field of pathology is needed, but the main hurdle causing the slow progress is the shortage of large-labeled datasets of histopathology images to train the models.

The economic boom in the MENA region over the past decades has brought exceptionally rapid shifts in eating habits characterized by divergence from the traditional Mediterranean diet towards a more westernized unhealthy dietary pattern, thought to be leading to the dramatic rises in obesity and non-communicable diseases. Research efforts have brought a greater understanding of the different pathways through which diet and obesity may affect diabetes clinical outcomes, emphasizing the crucial role of dietary interventions and weight loss in the prevention and management of diabetes. The purpose of this review is to explore the mechanistic pathways linking obesity with diabetes and to summarize the most recent evidence on the association of the intake of different macronutrients and food groups with the risk of type 2 diabetes. We also summarize the most recent evidence on the effectiveness of different macronutrient manipulations in the prevention and management of diabetes while highlighting the possible underlying mechanisms of action and latest evidence-based recommendations.

We examined whether differences in political affiliation influences the public’s interest in infection prevention measures in the United States. State-specific data on public search interest in four key infection prevention measures (Quarantine, Social distancing, Hand washing and Masks) were obtained from Google Trends for the period 1 January 2020 to 12 December 2020. Political affiliation was ascertained based on the 2020 U.S. Presidential election results and 2017 Cook Partisan Voting Index. Spearman’s rank, partial correlation, and multiple regression analyses were conducted to compare political partisanship with public interest in infection prevention measures and overall case rate per 100 000 population. Statistical analysis was performed in R version 4.0.3. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significantly increased public interest in infection prevention measures. The greater the support for the Democratic Party, the greater the search interest in all four measures analysed. Political partisanship was most highly correlated with searches relating to Quarantine (ρ = 0.79, p < 0.001), followed by Social distancing (ρ = 0.71, p < 0.001), Hand washing (ρ = 0.69, p < 0.001), and Masks (ρ = 0.66, p < 0.001). These findings were robust to using two different partisanship measures, controlling for state-level demographic variables, different pandemic onset dates, and using exact rather than Topic search methods. This partisan divide among the American people has important health implications that must be better addressed.

The present study investigated the relationship between ASMI and the bone mineral density (BMD) categories of postmenopausal women. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study with a probabilistic sample, sociodemographic, lifestyle, menopause time, anthropometric, and physical activity variables were collected. ASMI and BMD were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Participants were grouped according to BMD values into normal density, osteopenia, and osteoporosis. Multivariate logistic regression models were applied to verify the influence of ASMI on BMD. Data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software, version 22. The significance level for all tests was set at 5%. RESULTS: Of the 114 women analyzed, most were between 60 and 69.9 years of age (62.3%), on menopause for ≤19.0 (51.8%), self-declared brown race/color (49.1%), had < 4 years of education (41.2%), never smoked (69.0%) or drank alcohol (62.8%). Of these, 52.6% were classified as sufficiently active and 52.2% had regular sun exposure. Women with osteoporosis were older (p = 0.035), on menopause for a longer time (p = 0.011), underweight (p = 0.004), had adequate waist circumference (p = 0.017), and low ASMI values (p = 0.002). There was an association between the 1st tertile of ASMI and osteoporosis. However, after adjustments for age, race/color, and body mass index, the strength of association between BMD and ASMI was not maintained. CONCLUSIONS: ASMI was not associated with the BMD of the postmenopausal women evaluated. Total body and muscle mass, in addition to bone mass, should be monitored during menopause treatment. Longitudinal studies must be conducted to elucidate the mechanisms and gaps in this relationship.","da Cruz, Geise Ferreira; Lunz, Tatiana Mion; de Jesus, Tatielle Rocha; Costa, Mariana Braga; Vidigal, Camila Vilarinho; Albergaria, Ben-Hur; Marques-Rocha, Jose Luiz; Guandalini, Valdete Regina",BMC Musculoskelet Disord,221,9

Testing remains at a premium, and criteria for testing remains reserved for those with lower respiratory infection symptoms and/or a known high-risk exposure. The role of imaging in COVID-19 is rapidly evolving; however, few algorithms include imaging criteria, and it is unclear what should be done in low-suspicion patients with positive imaging findings. METHODS: From 03/01/2020–03/20/2020, a retrospective review of all patients with suspected COVID-19 on imaging was performed. Imaging was interpreted by a board-certified, fellowship-trained radiologist. Patients were excluded if COVID-19 infection was suspected at the time of presentation, was the reason for imaging, or if any lower respiratory symptoms were present. RESULTS: Eight patients with suspected COVID-19 infection on imaging were encountered. Seven patients received testing due to suspicious imaging findings with subsequent lab-confirmed COVID-19. No patients endorsed prior exposure to COVID-19 or recent international travel. COVID-19 was suggested in six patients incidentally on abdominal CT and two on chest radiography. At the time of presentation, no patients were febrile, and seven endorsed gastrointestinal symptoms. Five COVID-19 patients eventually developed respiratory symptoms and required intubation. Two patients expired during the admission. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with imaging findings suspicious for COVID-19 warrant prompt reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing even in low clinical suspicion cases. The prevalence of disease in the population may be underestimated by the current paradigm of RT-PCR testing with the current clinical criteria of lower respiratory symptoms and exposure risk.","Xiao, Nicholas; Abboud, Samir; McCarthy, Danielle M.; Parekh, Nishant",Emerg Radiol,221,6

For this purpose, we designed a computer-aided diagnosis and severity detection method by using transfer learning and a back propagation neural network. Method: To increase the learning capability, we used data augmentation. Most of the previously done works in this area concentrate on private datasets, but we used two publicly available datasets. The first section diagnose COVID-19 from the input CT image using the transfer learning of the pre-trained network ResNet-50. We used ResNet-50 and DenseNet-201 pre-trained networks for feature extraction and trained a back propagation neural network to classify it into High, Medium, and Low severity. Results: The proposed method for COVID-19 diagnosis gave an accuracy of 98.5% compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The experimental evaluation shows that combining the ResNet-50 and DenseNet-201 features gave more accurate results with the test data. The proposed system for COVID-19 severity detection gave better average classification accuracy of 97.84% compared with the state-of-the-art methods. This enables medical practitioners to identify the resources and treatment plans correctly. Conclusions: This work is useful in the medical field as a first-line severity risk detection that is helpful for medical personnel to plan patient care and assess the need for ICU facilities and ventilator support. A computer-aided system that is helpful to make a care plan for the huge amount of patient inflow each day is sure to be an asset in these turbulent times.","Āswathy, A. L.; Hareendran, S.

Various advanced medical imaging and machine learning techniques have been presented to detect these respiratory disorders accurately. In this work, we have proposed a novel COVID-19 detection system using an exemplar and hybrid fused deep feature generator with X-ray images. The proposed Exemplar COVID-19FclNet9 comprises three basic steps: exemplar deep feature generation, iterative feature selection and classification. The novelty of this work is the feature extraction using three pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the presented feature extraction phase. The common aspects of these pre-trained CNNs are that they have three fully connected layers, and these networks are AlexNet, VGG16 and VGG19. The fully connected layer of these networks is used to generate deep features using an exemplar structure, and a nine-feature generation method is obtained. The loss values of these feature extractors are computed, and the best three extractors are selected. The features of the top three fully connected features are merged. An iterative selector is used to select the most informative features. The chosen features are classified using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed COVID-19FclNet9 applied nine deep feature extraction methods by using three deep networks together. The most appropriate deep feature generation model selection and iterative feature selection have been employed to utilise their advantages together. By using these techniques, the image classification ability of the used three deep networks has been improved. The presented model is developed using four X-ray image corpora (DB1, DB2, DB3 and DB4) with two, three and four classes. The proposed Exemplar COVID-19FclNet9 achieved a classification accuracy of 97.60%, 89.96%, 98.84% and 99.64% using the SVM classifier with 10-fold cross-validation for four datasets, respectively.

Periodontitis, the most prevalent disease that leads to tooth loss, is caused by infection by periodontopathic bacteria. Periodontitis is also a risk factor for pneumonia and the exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, presumably because of the aspiration of saliva contaminated with periodontopathic bacteria into the lower respiratory tract. Patients with these diseases have increased rates of COVID-19 aggravation and mortality. Because periodontopathic bacteria have been isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with COVID-19, periodontitis may be a risk factor for COVID-19 aggravation. However, the molecular links between periodontitis and COVID-19 have not been clarified. In this study, we found that the culture supernatant of the periodontopathic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum (CSF) upregulated the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in A549 alveolar epithelial cells. In addition, CSF induced interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 production by both A549 and primary alveolar epithelial cells. CSF also strongly induced IL-6 and IL-8 expression by BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells and Detroit 562 pharyngeal epithelial cells. These results suggest that when patients with mild COVID-19 frequently aspirate periodontopathic bacteria, SARS-CoV-2 infection is promoted, and inflammation in the lower respiratory tract may become severe in the presence of viral pneumonia.","Takahashi, Yuwa; Watanabe, Norihisa; Kamio, Noriaki; Yokoe, Sho; Suzuki, Ryuta; Sato, Shuichi; Iinuma, Toshimitsu; Imai, Kenichi",Int J Mol Sci,221,16

Healthcare personnel are highly exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Therefore, we decided to offer them ivermectin as a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) method. Purpose: Primary outcome was to measure the number of healthcare workers with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID-19 test in the ivermectin group and in the control group. Secondary outcome was to measure the number of sick healthcare workers with a positive RT-PCR COVID-19 test whose condition deteriorated and required hospitalization and/or an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), or who died, in the ivermectin group and in the control group. Material and methods: This observational and retrospective cohort study was carried out in two medical centers, Centro Medico Bournigal (CMBO) in Puerto Plata and Centro Medico Punta Cana (CMPC) in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. The study began on June 29, 2020, and ended on July 26, 2020.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study of general practitioner (GP), nurse and paramedic primary care consultations in 21 practices in South-West England covering 123 947 patients. The models compared potential cancer indicators reported in April–July 2019 with April–July 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Potential indicators of cancer were identified using code lists for symptoms, signs, test results and diagnoses listed in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suspected cancer referral guidance (NG12). RESULTS: During April–July 2019, 17% of registered patients aged 50+ years reported a potential cancer indicator in a consultation with a GP or nurse. During April–July 2020, this reduced to 11% (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.67, p<0.001). Reductions in potential cancer indicators were stable across age group, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation quintile and shielding status, but less marked in patients with mental health conditions than without (IRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.79, interaction p<0.001). Proportions of GP consultations with potential indicators of cancer reduced between 2019 and 2020 for face-to-face consultations (IRR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92, p<0.001) and increased for remote consultations (IRR 1.17, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.29, p=0.001), although it remained lower in remote consulting than face-to-face in April–July 2020. This difference was greater for nurse/paramedic consultations (face-to-face: IRR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.83, p=0.002; remote: IRR 1.60, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.333, p=0.014). CONCLUSION: The number of patients consulting with presentations that could potentially indicate cancer reduced during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients should be encouraged to continue contacting primary care for persistent signs and symptoms, and GPs and nurses should be encouraged to probe patients for further information during remote consulting, in the absence of non-verbal cues.","Scott, Lauren J; Murphy, Mairead; Price, Sarah; Lewis, Rhys; Denholm, Rachel; Horwood, Jeremy; Palmer, Tom; Salisbury, Chris",BMJ Open,221,24

Human activities that increase exposure to bats will likely increase the opportunity for infections to spill over in the future. Ecological drivers of pathogen spillover and emergence in novel hosts, including humans, involve a complex mixture of processes, and understanding these complexities may aid in predicting spillover. In particular, only once the pathogen and host ecologies are known can the impacts of anthropogenic changes be fully appreciated. Cross-disciplinary approaches are required to understand how host and pathogen ecology interact. Bats differ from other sylvatic disease reservoirs because of their unique and diverse lifestyles, including their ability to fly, often highly gregarious social structures, long lifespans and low fecundity rates. We highlight how these traits may affect infection dynamics and how both host and pathogen traits may interact to affect infection dynamics. We identify key questions relating to the ecology of infectious diseases in bats and propose that a combination of field and laboratory studies are needed to create data-driven mechanistic models to elucidate those aspects of bat ecology that are most critical to the dynamics of emerging bat viruses. If commonalities can be found, then predicting the dynamics of newly emerging diseases may be possible. This modelling approach will be particularly important in scenarios when population surveillance data are unavailable and when it is unclear which aspects of host ecology are driving infection dynamics.","Hayman, D T S; Bowen, R A; Cryan, P M; McCracken, G F; O’Shea, T J; Peel, A J; Gilbert, A; Webb, C T; Wood, J L N",Zoonoses Public Health,221,1

In the current study, we used the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) to assess the response to fear within health staff in Mexico. This was a cross-sectional survey study in which we administered the Spanish version of the FCV-19S to hospital staff. The FCV-19S is a seven-item questionnaire that assesses the severity of fear caused by COVID-19. A total of 2860 participants—1641 female and 1218 male personnel from three hospitals—were included in the study. The internal reliability of the scale was good, with Cronbach’s alpha of .902. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted on the seven items of the FCV-19S, showing good model fit (χ(2) (7) = 29.40, p < .001; CFI = .99; TLI = .99; RMSEA = .03; SRMR = .010; AIC = 71.40). We found a global FCV-19S mean score of 19.3 ± 6.9, with a significant difference in scores between women and men. Our survey shows a significantly higher level of fear in nursing and administrative personnel, which may be explained by the nursing staff being in close contact with infected patients and the administrative staff lacking understanding of the possible implications of the infection, compared with nonclinical hospital personnel. Our results are consistent with those of other researchers. We must remember that fear is a reaction and that we must be courageous enough to trust validated infection prevention practices to provide the highest standard of care, in the safest environment that we can, for as long as we can.","García-Reyna, Benjamín; Castillo-García, Gilberto Daniel; Barbosa-Camacho, Francisco José; Cervantes-Cardona, Guillermo Alonso; Cervantes-Pérez, Enrique; Torres-Mendoza, Blanca Miriam; Fuentes-Orozco, Clotilde; Pintor-Belmontes, Kevin Josue; Guzmán-Ramírez, Bertha Georgina; Hernández-Bernal, Aldo; González-Ojeda, Alejandro; Cervantes-Guevara, Gabino",Int J Ment Health Addict,221,1

This question is important in engineering problems, particularly in problems of prolongation of the guaranteed service life. The discussion here is restricted by the longevity evaluation only at the post-processing stage of unidirectional loaded machine parts. It means the realizations might be recorded. Some experimental and speculative evidence of preferable use the Rainflow method is shown. Taking into account the huge computer's power nowadays, the question of the irrelevance of appellation to the calculation accelerating using the spectral methods is specially discussed. There are areas, where the spectral methods are really necessary. There is only a need to recommend the restriction of their application scope to these special situations. It seems there is no need in inventing new spectral complicated algorithms only to stress out at the end, that their result coincides with the Rainflow outcome. That might be confusing for the practicing engineers. Currently, the main attention among supporters of spectral methods is focused on non-stationary and non-Gaussian random processes. (to estimate the spectral density is impossible for non-stationary processes, according to definition). These researchers seem to have forgotten, that even for these complicated situations the decision has already existed: that is the Rainflow and its analogues. The paper shows extensive laboratory experiment results of random fatigue testing of aluminum flat specimens under regular (to build the fatigue curve) and irregular (random) loading. The fatigue life curve (Gassner curve) has been built. These results allowed to compare the existing computation methods of longevity estimation. In the particular situation of narrow-band process, the methods seem to provide comparative results. Considered are methodological issues related to the assessment of the necessary and sufficient realization length, the influence of RMS, cycle counting methods and some possibilities of computing resources saving when using the Rainflow method. The stability of the Rainflow estimates is confirmed. Some problems with the choice of parameters during the longevity assessment by the Dirlik method were noted.","Gadolina, I. V.; Makhutov, N.

Diagnostic methods have until recently been available only for a limited number of these viruses. With the objective to achieve sensitive assays for all respiratory viruses, a rational workflow in the laboratory, and a short turn‐around time, a real‐time PCR diagnostic platform for daily rapid detection of 15 respiratory viruses was developed. The system was evaluated on 585 stored nasopharyngeal aspirates from hospitalized children. Previous analysis by immunofluorescence and virus isolation identified viruses in 37% of the samples while the new PCR diagnostic panel detected 57% virus positive samples. The new platform was introduced in the laboratory in October 2007 and has then fully replaced the standard immunofluorescence assay for rapid detection of viruses and virus isolation. J. Med.

DESIGN: Real-world prospective observational study. SETTING: VH remote assessment service in West Hertfordshire NHS Trust, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with suspected COVID-19 illness enrolled directly from the community (postaccident and emergency (A&E) or medical intake assessment) or postinpatient admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death or (re-)admission to inpatient hospital care during VH follow-up and for 2 weeks post-VH discharge. RESULTS: 900 patients with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 (455 referred from A&E or medical intake and 445 postinpatient) were included in the analysis. 76 (8.4%) of these experienced clinical deterioration (15 deaths in admitted patients, 3 deaths in patients not admitted and 58 additional inpatient admissions). Predictors of clinical deterioration were increase in age (OR 1.04 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.06) per year of age), history of cancer (OR 2.87 (95% CI 1.41 to 5.82)), history of mental health problems (OR 1.76 (95% CI 1.02 to 3.04)), severely impaired renal function (OR for eGFR <30=9.09 (95% CI 2.01 to 41.09)) and having a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result (OR 2.0 (95% CI 1.11 to 3.60)). CONCLUSIONS: These predictors may help direct intensity of monitoring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who are being remotely monitored by primary or secondary care services. Further research is needed to confirm our findings and identify the reasons for increased risk of clinical deterioration associated with cancer and mental health problems.","Francis, Nick A; Stuart, Beth; Knight, Matthew; Vancheeswaran, Rama; Oliver, Charles; Willcox, Merlin; Barlow, Andrew; Moore, Michael",BMJ Open,221,24
