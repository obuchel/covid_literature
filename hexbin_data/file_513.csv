14380,"Structure of human endo-α-1,2-mannosidase (MANEA), an antiviral host-glycosylation target",2020-11-24,"RNAi technology has significant potential as a future therapeutic and could theoretically be used to knock down disease-specific RNAs. However, due to frequent off-target effects, low efficiency, and limited accessibility of nuclear transcripts, the clinical application of the technology remains challenging. In this study, we first assessed the stability of Cas13a mRNA and guide RNA. Next, we titrated Cas13a and guide RNA vectors to achieve effective knockdown of firefly luciferase (FLuc) RNA, used as a target transcript. The interference specificity of Cas13a on guide RNA design was next explored. Subsequently, we targeted the EML4-ALK v1 transcript in H3122 lung cancer cells. As determined by FLuc assay, Cas13a exhibited activity only toward the orientation of the crRNA–guide RNA complex residing at the 5′ of the crRNA. The activity of Cas13a was maximal for guide RNAs 24–30 bp in length, with relatively low mismatch tolerance. After knockdown of the EML4-ALK transcript, cell viability was decreased up to 50%. Cas13a could effectively knock down FLuc luminescence (70–76%), mCherry fluorescence (72%), and EML4-ALK at the protein (>80%) and transcript levels (26%). Thus, Cas13a has strong potential for use in RNA regulation and therapeutics, and could contribute to the development of personalized medicine.",", Saifullah; Sakari, Matomo; Suzuki, Takeshi; Yano, Seiji; Tsukahara, Toshifumi",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7727695/,513
51856,"HIV/AIDS: Current Updates on the Disease, Treatment and Prevention",2021-04-23,"Many educational institutions have adopted e-learning under COVID-19 pandemic to maintain school teaching activities. Most teachers were encouraged to use online instruction in early February 2020. Thus, whether online learning changes students’ learning habits and replaces traditional physical teaching methods, online learning has become a keen topic. Based on the push–pull–mooring model, we proposed a comprehensive research model and explored the impact of online learning during COVID-19 pandemic on students’ attitude and behavioral intention. We found that push effects (perceived security risk, learning convenience, and service quality), pull effects (usefulness, ease of use, teacher’s teaching attitude, task-technology fit), and mooring effects (switching cost, habit) had significantly influence the switching intentions of users from physical course to online learning platforms. The findings of this study will bring more insights into e-learning during an epidemic crisis.","Lin, Chien-Liang; Jin, Yuan Qing; Zhao, Qun; Yu, Sung-Wen; Su, Yu-Sheng",Asia-Pacific Edu Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8054856/,513

59729,Role of troponin in COVID-19 pandemic: a review of literature.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm is a rare but serious complication from myocardial infarction and cardiac surgery. Although standard treatment is surgical intervention, percutaneous closure of left ventricular pseudoaneurysm has become an option for high-risk surgical candidates. Experience with percutaneous treatment is limited to a few single case reports. This is the first series of percutaneous treatment of the left ventricular pseudoaneurysms. METHODS AND RESULTS This is a retrospective analysis of 9 procedures of percutaneous repair of left ventricular pseudoaneurysm in 7 consecutive patients (ages 51 to 83 years, 6 men) completed in our Structural Heart Disease center from June 2008 to December 2010. All patients were considered as a high risk for surgery because of multiple comorbidities. Multiple imaging modalities were used before, during, and after the procedures to improve success and efficacy. The left ventricular pseudoaneurysms of all 7 patients were successfully repaired. Fluoroscopy time on average was 36.5±24.0 minutes (range, 12.4 to 75.7 minutes). All patients were followed up for a period ranging from 3 to 32 months after the procedure. Each patient improved by at least 1 New York Heart Association functional class, and 4 patients improved by 2 classes. CONCLUSIONS Transcatheter closure of the left ventricular pseudoaneurysm is a feasible alternative for high-risk surgical candidates. The use of multiple imaging modalities is required for a detail planning and execution of the procedure.","Dudiy, Yuriy; Jelnin, Vladimir; Einhorn, Bryce N; Kronzon, Itzhak; Cohen, Howard A; Ruiz, Carlos E",Circulation.

The performance of these devices has been dramatically improved through the advent of new materials and micro-/nanofabrication technologies. This is especially true for micro-/nanosized cantilever sensors, which undergo a change in mechanical properties upon the specific binding of biomolecules. In this review, we introduce the basic principles of cantilever biosensors in static and dynamic modes. We also summarize a range of approaches to cantilever design, fabrication, and instrumentation according to their applications. More specifically, we describe cantilever-based detections of proteins, DNA molecules, bacteria, and viruses and discuss current challenges related to the targets' biophysical characteristics.","Hwang, Kyo Seon; Lee, Sang-Myung; Kim, Sang Kyung; Lee, Jeong Hoon; Kim, Tae Song",Annual review of analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-anchem-060908-155232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20636054/,513

We present our experience in single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy by using a grasper directly without using a trocar in five patients. Methods and Results. The technique involves the use of Karl Storz 27290F grasper in order to perform gallbladder retraction in single port cholecystectomy. The grasper was introduced directly into the skin through abdominal wall without using any trocar and used to mobilize gallbladder whenever needed during surgery without causing any perforation or leakage of the gallbladder. There were no intraoperative and postoperative complications in 5 patients with the advantages of shorter operation time and almost invisible postoperative skin scar formation. Conclusion. We claim that the use of this instrument in SILS surgery might be advantageous than the conventional placement of sutures for the gallbladder mobilization.,"Gulpinar, Kamil; Ozdemir, Suleyman; Ozis, S Erpulat; Aydin, Turgut; Korkmaz, Atila","HPB surgery : a world journal of hepatic, pancreatic and biliary surgery",https://doi.org/10.1155/2011/761315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21915161/,513

METHODS We performed a retrospective review of a prospective database of all patients undergoing robotic-assisted intracorporeal urinary diversion with stentless ureteroenteric anastomosis between March 2014 and July 2016. Diversions were performed at the time of either robotic-assisted laparoscopic cystectomy for bladder cancer or urinary diversion for other indications. RESULTS A total of 10 patients underwent implantation of 20 ureters into the intestine via a robotic-assisted approach with intentional omission of stents. Median body mass index was 29.57 (first quartile 23.68, third quartile 34.69). Median American Society of Anesthesiologists score was 3 (range 2-3). Seven patients had intracorporeal ileal conduit reconstruction and 3 patients had an intracorporeal neobladder creation. There were no patients who developed a stricture of the ureter nor did any patient develop a leak at the ureteroenteric anastomosis. All patients had normal serum creatinine at least 4 weeks after surgery, and all patients had follow-up computed tomography of the kidneys, which were normal. The median follow-up was 8 months (first quartile = 3 months, third quartile = 17 months). CONCLUSION Robotic intracorporeal urinary diversion with intentional omission of ureteral stents is a safe and feasible option when establishing continuity of the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts.","Tan, Wei Phin; Whelan, Patrick; Deane, Leslie A",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2017.01.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28111222/,513
64161,Early combination treatment with existing HIV antivirals: an effective treatment for COVID-19?,2021-03-01,"The Warburg effect is characterised by increased glucose uptake and lactate secretion in cancer cells resulting from metabolic transformation in tumour tissue. The corresponding molecular pathways switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, due to changes in glucose degradation mechanisms known as the 'Warburg reprogramming' of cancer cells. Key glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporters and transcription factors involved in the Warburg transformation are frequently dysregulated during carcinogenesis considered as promising diagnostic and prognostic markers as well as treatment targets. Flavonoids are molecules with pleiotropic activities. The metabolism-regulating anticancer effects of flavonoids are broadly demonstrated in preclinical studies. Flavonoids modulate key pathways involved in the Warburg phenotype including but not limited to PKM2, HK2, GLUT1 and HIF-1. The corresponding molecular mechanisms and clinical relevance of 'anti-Warburg' effects of flavonoids are discussed in this review article. The most prominent examples are provided for the potential application of targeted 'anti-Warburg' measures in cancer management. Individualised profiling and patient stratification are presented as powerful tools for implementing targeted 'anti-Warburg' measures in the context of predictive, preventive and personalised medicine.","Samec, Marek; Liskova, Alena; Koklesova, Lenka; Samuel, Samson Mathews; Zhai, Kevin; Buhrmann, Constanze; Varghese, Elizabeth; Abotaleb, Mariam; Qaradakhi, Tawar; Zulli, Anthony; Kello, Martin; Mojzis, Jan; Zubor, Pavol; Kwon, Taeg Kyu; Shakibaei, Mehdi; Büsselberg, Dietrich; Sarria, Gustavo R; Golubnitschaja, Olga; Kubatka, Peter",The EPMA journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13167-020-00217-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32843908/,513

A true-experimental research design was conducted at nursing college, Najran University, KSA. A comprehensive sampling was followed to include all female students at the colleges (164 students). The sample was divided randomly into intervention (82) and control group (82). The educational intervention was designed and conducted based on the HBM through four sequential phases: assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluation. The current study results indicated no statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups concerning their demographic characteristic, awareness, and health beliefs before intervention. After intervention, significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between intervention and control groups in their awareness and all HBM constructs regarding COVID19. There were positive, statistically significant correlations (P < 0.05) between participants' total HBM score and their total awareness score. This study concluded that HBM is effective in increasing nursing students' awareness regarding COVID-19. It also increases their perceived susceptibility, severity, and benefits. Besides, it may increase their self-efficacy to overcome perceived barriers to practice protective and preventive actions while dealing with COVID-19.","Elgzar, Wafaa T; Al-Qahtani, Awad M; Elfeki, Nahid K; Ibrahim, Heba A",African journal of reproductive health,https://doi.org/10.29063/ajrh2020/v24i2s.12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34077057/,513

In this study, ORF3b homologues were identified from three bat SL-CoV strains. These ORF3b homologues were C-terminally truncated and lacked the C-terminal NLS of SARS-CoV. IFN antagonist activities analysis demonstrated that one SL-CoV ORF3b still possessed IFN antagonist and IRF3-modulating activities. These results indicate that different ORF3b proteins display different IFN antagonist activities and this function is independent of the protein's nuclear localization, suggesting a potential link between bat SL-CoV ORF3b function and viral pathogenesis.","Zhou, Peng; Li, Hongxia; Wang, Hanzhong; Wang, Lin-Fa; Shi, Zhengli",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.033589-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22012463/,513

This renders the goal of active immunization of the population through vaccination a worldwide public health priority. In fact, only when efficient vaccination programs will be successfully implemented, a return to pre-pandemic normality can be considered. The scientific community has made a tremendous effort to blow the lid off the pathogenesis of the disease, and unprecedented efforts are ongoing with governments, private organizations, and academics working together to expeditiously develop safe and efficacious vaccines. Previous research efforts in the development of vaccines for other coronaviruses (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) as well other emerging viruses have opened the door for exploiting several strategies to design a new vaccine against the pandemic virus. Indeed, in a few months, a stunning number of vaccines have been proposed, and almost 50 putative vaccine candidates have entered clinical trials. The different vaccine candidates use different vaccine development platforms, from inactivated whole virus vaccine to subunit vaccine, nucleic acid, and vectored vaccines.

Measuring OAS1 levels in 504 individuals, we found that higher plasma OAS1 levels in a non-infectious state were associated with reduced COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Further analyses suggested that a Neanderthal isoform of OAS1 in individuals of European ancestry affords this protection.

Exceptionally small plating systems for these birds are required, which are relatively expensive and difficult to insert. To study avian fracture healing after repair using miniplates, we evaluated 2 steel miniplate systems in 27 pigeons ( Columba livia ) divided into 4 groups. In each pigeon, the left ulna and radius were transected and the ulna was repaired with a bone plate. In groups A and B, a 1.3-mm adaption plate was applied without and with a figure-of-eight bandage; in groups C and D, a 1.0-mm compression plate was applied without and with a bandage, respectively. Healing was evaluated with radiographs after 3, 14, and 28 days; flight tests were conducted after 14, 21, and 28 days; and the wing was macroscopically examined after euthanasia of birds on day 28. Fractures healed without bending or distortion of the plate in all 27 birds, and no significant differences in healing were found between treatment groups. At the end of the study, 23 pigeons (85.2%) showed good or very good flight ability. Results show the 1.3-mm adaption plate and the 1.0-mm compression plate meet the requirements for avian osteosynthesis and can be recommended for fracture repair of the ulna or other long bones in birds weighing less than 500 g.

METHODS Novel series of 8-(proline/pyrazole)-substituted xanthine analogs has been synthesized. The affinity and selectivity of compounds to adenosine receptors have been assessed by radioligand binding studies. The synthesized compounds also showed good bronchospasmolytic properties (increased onset of bronchospasm; decreased duration of jerks) with 100% survival of animals in comparison to the standard drug. Besides, compound 8f & 9f showed good binding affinity in comparison to other synthesized compounds in the micromolar range. RESULTS The maximum binding affinity of these compounds was observed for A2B receptors, which is ~ 7 or 10 times higher as compared to A1, A2A and A3 receptors. The newly synthesized derivatives 8f, 9a-f, 17g-m, and 18g-m displayed significant protection against histamine aerosol induced bronchospasm in guinea pigs. CONCLUSION Newly synthesized proline/pyrazole based xanthines compounds showed a satisfactory binding affinity for adenosine receptor subtypes. Replacement or variation of substituted proline ring with substituted pyrazole scaffold at 8thposition of xanthine moiety resulted in the reduction of adenosine binding affinity and bronchospasmolytic effects.","Singh, Sneha; Ojha, Madhwi; Yadav, Divya; Kachler, Sonja; Klotz, Karl-Norbert; Yadav, Rakesh",Current drug discovery technologies,https://doi.org/10.2174/1570163817666200922121005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962622/,513

Outcome measures included changes in number of prescriptions issued for Schedule II long-acting or short-acting (SA) opioids and the MPEs involving these medications. Requiring a security form was associated with a sustained prescribing increase for SA hydromorphone, meperidine, and SA oxycodone; no prescribing changes were found for SA fentanyl, methadone, and SA morphine, or for any long-acting opioids. The same policy change, however, increased MPEs involving all opioids. Further effort is required to determine how California's PMP can continue to ensure availability of prescription opioids for medical use while better mitigating their diversion. PERSPECTIVE Statistical model-building was used to evaluate the influence of changes to California's prescription monitoring program. The extent that practitioners prescribe Schedule II opioids and the incidence of people receiving prescriptions from multiple providers were measured. Such research illustrates the viability of evaluating drug control program impact on prescribing practice and potential diversion behaviors.","Gilson, Aaron M; Fishman, Scott M; Wilsey, Barth L; Casamalhuapa, Carlos; Baxi, Hassan",The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpain.2011.09.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22112420/,513
80810,Case report of COVID-19 in an elderly patient: could SARS-CoV2 trigger myositis?,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND Compared to an equivalent sized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) double-lumen tube (DLT), a silicone DLT has a shorter endobronchial segment. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of clinically significant displacement of left-sided PVC and silicone DLTs after a positional change to a lateral position from a supine position and determine its effect on the need for DLT repositioning for successful lung separation in patients undergoing thoracic surgery. METHODS One hundred eight adult patients requiring one-lung ventilation were randomly divided into group P (PVC DLT, n = 54) and group S (Silicone DLT, n = 54). The position of the DLT was observed before and after lateral positioning to assess the effect of the position change. The incidence of clinically significant displacement (> 10 mm) of DLT was compared between the groups. RESULTS DLTs were clinically significantly displaced in group P (17/48, 35.4%) and group S (18/52, 34.6%) after lateral positioning (P = 0.933). A proximal displacement (31.3% [group P] and 25.0% [group S]) was more common than distal displacement (4.2% [group P] and 9.6% [group S]), with no significant intergroup difference (P = 0.494). After lateral positioning, critical malposition of DLT with bronchial herniation to the right main bronchus was 8.3% (group P) and 7.9% (group S, P = 0.906). CONCLUSIONS Left-sided PVC and silicone DLTs produced comparable incidences of clinically significant displacement and, consequently, required similar rates of repositioning for successful lung separation after lateral positioning.","Kwon, Nyeong Keon; Jung, Sung Mee; Park, Sang-Jin; Han, Yonghee",Korean journal of anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.4097/kja.d.18.00012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29921088/,513

In nonpregnant populations, physical exercise has shown to be an effective adjunctive therapy option for substance use disorders. Given the known positive maternal and fetal physiological and mental health benefits associated with prenatal exercise, perhaps exercise during pregnancy may also be a viable adjuvant therapy option for women with substance use disorders. The purpose of this scoping review was to summarize the available literature that has assessed the relationship between prenatal exercise and substance use disorders. METHODS A search strategy was developed combining the terms pregnancy, exercise/physical activity, and substance use. A systematic search was completed in the following databases: Medline/PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and ProQuest. Substances eligible for inclusion included illicit drugs, alcohol, and cannabis. Retrieved data were categorized as animal or human model studies, and were summarized narratively. RESULTS Eight studies were included in this review (five human studies, three animal model studies). Studies in humans suggest that pregnant women with substance use disorders are interested in engaging in physical activity interventions; however, known acute metabolic and physiological responses to prenatal exercise may be impaired in this population. Rodent models show preliminary evidence for improved mental health outcomes following prenatal exercise for substance use disorders. CONCLUSION The findings from this review may inform the development of future clinical trials to test the effect of structured exercise programs as an adjunctive treatment option for pregnant women with substance use disorders.","Nagpal, Taniya S; Bhattacharjee, Jayonta; da Silva, Danilo F; Souza, Sara C S; Mohammad, Shuhiba; Puranda, Jessica L; Abu-Dieh, Anas; Cook, Jocelynn; Adamo, Kristi B",Birth defects research,https://doi.org/10.1002/bdr2.1803; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32940021/,513

To address these gaps in the literature, we carried out two studies to develop and validate a new Mating Effort Questionnaire (MEQ). In Study 1, we report a pilot study in which participants' responses to an item pool were submitted to exploratory factor analysis. In Study 2, we replicated the structure found in Study 1 using confirmatory factor analysis in an independent sample. A three-factor solution yielded the best fit. The three factors reflected respondents' allocation of energy to attracting high mate value partners when already mated, seeking out romantic partners when single, and investing in their current romantic partner and relationships. Strong partial measurement invariance held across the sexes, implying that observed scores may be used to compare them. We also found evidence of concurrent validity via associations between the MEQ and constructs such as sociosexual orientation, K-factor, mate retention behaviors, and respondents' sexual behavior. These findings suggest that the MEQ is a valid and novel measure of individual differences in mating effort which is well suited to complement existing mating effort measures.","Albert, Graham; Richardson, George B; Arnocky, Steven; Senveli, Zeynep; Hodges-Simeon, Carolyn R",Archives of sexual behavior,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-020-01799-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839933/,513
82782,"Randomized clinical trial ""olfactory dysfunction after COVID-19: olfactory rehabilitation therapy vs. intervention treatment with Palmitoylethanolamide and Luteolin"": preliminary results.",2021-06-01,"INTRODUCTION In order to be eligible for consultant appointments within the NHS, orthodontists can undertake higher specialty training after their Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training (CCST). These training posts are known as Post-CCST positions and orthodontists must be eligible for inclusion on the General Dental Council's (GDC) specialist list for orthodontics before applying. There has been a decline in the number of applicants and the number of filled Post-CCST positions in recent years, leading to concerns over a potential shortage of appropriately trained consultant orthodontists to provide a secondary care service in the near future. This survey was undertaken to identify barriers to applying for Post-CCST training and assess potential options for increasing trainee numbers. METHODS An online survey was distributed, by email, to current orthodontic trainees and those that had recently completed training in the last six months via the British Orthodontic Society Training Grades Group. Reminder emails were sent at two and four weeks. A total of 201 trainees were invited to complete the survey. RESULTS Eighty-nine trainees completed the survey (response rate of 44.3%). Regarding applying to Post-CCST training, 32.6% and 47.7% of respondents, respectively, either wanted to or were considering applying for Post-CCST training. The South East was the most preferred region for Post-CCST training (38.0%). Reasons for not wishing to complete Post-CCST training included salary (71.9%), lack of consultant posts in desired regions (64.1%) and inability/unwillingness to relocate (63.5%). Part-time training (91.0%) and a higher salary during training (86.0%) were most likely to incentivise application for Post-CCST training. CONCLUSION Financial, family and geographical concerns appear to be the main reasons why trainees might not consider Post-CCST training. Part-time and run-through training options may encourage trainees to apply for Post-CCST training.","Quach, Stacey; Mittal, Tarun; Bell, Gavin",Journal of orthodontics,https://doi.org/10.1177/1465312520963397; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33118473/,513
83275,The effects of COVID-19 pandemic on elective post-bariatric surgery waiting list: a single Plastic Surgery Center investigation.,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited disorders that result in haemoglobin abnormalities and other complications. Injury to the spleen, among other factors, contribute to persons with SCD being particularly susceptible to infection. Infants and very young children are especially vulnerable. The 'Co-operative Study of Sickle Cell Disease' observed an incidence rate for pneumococcal septicaemia of 10 per 100 person-years in children under the age of three years. Vaccines, including customary pneumococcal vaccines, may be of limited use in this age group. Therefore, prophylactic penicillin regimens may be advisable for this population. This is an update of a Cochrane Review which was first published in 2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2017. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis against pneumococcus in children with SCD receiving antibiotic prophylaxis compared to those without in relation to: 1. incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection; 2. mortality (as reported in the included studies); 3. drug-related adverse events (as reported in the included studies) to the individual and the community; 4. the impact of discontinuing at various ages on incidence of infection and mortality. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and also two clinical trials registries: ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Registry Platform (not in 2020 given access issues relating to Covid-19 pandemic). Additionally, we carried out hand searching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 25 January 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic antibiotics to prevent pneumococcal infection in children with SCD with placebo, no treatment or a comparator drug. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS The standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane were used. Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS Six trials were identified by the searches, of which three trials were eligible for inclusion. A total of 880 children, who were between three months to five years of age at randomization were included. The included studies were conducted in centres in the USA and in Kingston, Jamaica. In trials that investigated initiation of penicillin on risk of pneumococcal infection, the odds ratio was 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.86) (two trials, 457 children) (low-certainty evidence), while for withdrawal the odds ratio was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 2.71) (one trial, 400 children) (low-certainty evidence). Adverse drug effects were rare and minor. Rates of pneumococcal infection were found to be relatively low in children over the age of five years. Overall, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was judged to be low. The results from the risk of bias assessment undertaken identified two domains in which the risk of bias was considered to be high, these were incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) (two trials) and allocation concealment (selection bias) (one trial). Domains considered to have a low risk of bias for all three trials were selective reporting (reporting bias) and blinding (performance and detection bias). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The evidence examined was determined to be of low certainty and suggests that prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous SCD, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin.","Rankine-Mullings, Angela E; Owusu-Ofori, Shirley",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd003427.pub5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33724440/,513

84286,Metformin doses and body mass index: clinical outcomes in insulin resistant polycystic ovary syndrome women.,2020-08-01,"SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) is a novel virus that has caused over 28 million cases worldwide and over 900,000 deaths since early 2020, rightfully being classified as a pandemic. COVID-19 is diagnosed via PCR testing which looks at cycle threshold values of two genes, N2 and E. This study examined cycle threshold values of COVID-positive patients at the VA hospital in Reno as well as other lab values and co-morbidities to determine if any could aid clinicians in predicting the need for hospitalization and higher levels of care. Multiple variables, including N2 cycle threshold (CT) value, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), D-dimer, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen and ferritin were evaluated for potential associations with N2 CT value as well as required level of care (based on WHO ordinal score). The results suggest that patients with a N2 cycle threshold value less than 34 are 4 times more likely to have WHO ordinal scores of 4-8 (p=0.0021) while controlling for age and comorbidities (DM, cardiac, kidney and lung disease). Patients of age of 55 or greater were 15.18 times more likely to have WHO ordinal scores of 4-8 (p=0.012) controlling for N2 CT value and co-morbidities. Furthermore, patients with ALC less than 1 were 5.88 times more likely to have WHO ordinal score of 4-8 (p= 0.00024). N2 cycle threshold values also appear to be associated with many commonly obtained markers such as absolute lymphocyte count, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein and D-dimer. Patients with N2 CT values less than 34 were 3.49 times more likely to have ALC values less than 1, controlling for age and comorbidities (p=0.0072) while patients 55 or older were 6.66 times more likely to have ALC less than 1 (p=0.027). Finally, this study confirms previous conclusions that patients with advanced age had more severe infections and thus will likely require higher levels of care.

Here in, a series of 2-(4-[4-acetylpiperazine-1-carbonyl]phenyl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-4-carboxamide derivatives have been designed, synthesized, and successful characterization as novel and effective poly ADP-ribose polymerases (PARP)-1 inhibitors to improve the structure-activity relationships about the substituents in the hydrophobic pocket. These derivatives were evaluated for their PARP-1 inhibitory activity and cellular inhibitory against BRCA-1 deficient cells (MDA-MB-436) and wild cells (MCF-7) using PARP kit assay and MTT method. The results indicated that compared with other heterocyclic compounds, furan ring-substituted derivatives 14n-14q showed better PARP-1 inhibitory activity. Among this derivatives, compound 14p displayed the strongest inhibitory effects on PARP-1 enzyme (IC50 = 0.023 μM), which was close to that of Olaparib. 14p (IC50 = 43.56 ± 0.69 μM) and 14q (IC50 = 36.69 ± 0.83 μM) displayed good antiproliferation activity on MDA-MB-436 cells and inactivity on MCF-7 cells, indicating that 14p and 14q have high selectivity and targeting. The molecular docking method was used to explore the binding mode of compound 14p and PARP-1, and implied that the formation of hydrogen bond was essential for PARP-1 inhibition activities. This study also showed that in the hydrophobic pocket (AD binding sites), the introduction of strong electronegative groups (furan ring, e.g.) or halogen atoms in the side chain of benzimidazole might improve its inhibitory activity and this strategy could be applied in further research.","Chen, Miaojia; Huang, Honglin; Wu, Kaiyue; Liu, Yunfan; Jiang, Lizhi; Li, Yang; Tang, Guotao; Peng, Junmei; Cao, Xuan",Drug development research,https://doi.org/10.1002/ddr.21843; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151456/,513

While decades of research have established a negativity bias in processing in depression, there is still a gap in our understanding of how depression severity impacts sensitivity to detecting differences in emotional faces. METHODS We examined emotion sensitivity (ES), or the ability to to detect subtle differences in emotional faces, in a large, geographically and culturally diverse, web-based sample (N = 6598, age range = 18-96, 56.50% female, 66% Caucasian). Participants completed ES tasks (fear, anger, or happiness) and a Beck Depression Inventory-II, to determine depression severity. RESULTS Depression severity was correlated with overall ES performance as well as ES performance for individual emotions. Higher depression scores were associated with poorer performance in detecting happiness, fear, and anger (ps < .001). Examining performance by region, Eastern countries showed significantly poorer ES performance compared to Western countries, and were significantly more depressed. LIMITATIONS Our sample is non-clinical and self-selected. CONCLUSIONS This study is an extension of existing research on emotional facial processing, with an approach that takes into consideration the heterogeneity of depression symptoms and corrects psychometric confounds of traditional emotion face processing paradigms. Overall, factors related to severity, task reliability, and facial stimuli should be considered in determining the potential mechanism of facial emotion processing in the onset and course of depression.","Rutter, Lauren A; Passell, Eliza; Scheuer, Luke; Germine, Laura",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734904/,513
87386,The first case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) triggered by COVID-19 infection.,2020-09-01,"Infection-induced aversion against enteropathogens is a conserved sickness behaviour that can promote host survival1,2. The aetiology of this behaviour remains poorly understood, but studies in Drosophila have linked olfactory and gustatory perception to avoidance behaviours against toxic microorganisms3-5. Whether and how enteric infections directly influence sensory perception to induce or modulate such behaviours remains unknown. Here we show that enteropathogen infection in Drosophila can modulate olfaction through metabolic reprogramming of ensheathing glia of the antennal lobe. Infection-induced unpaired cytokine expression in the intestine activates JAK-STAT signalling in ensheathing glia, inducing the expression of glial monocarboxylate transporters and the apolipoprotein glial lazarillo (GLaz), and affecting metabolic coupling of glia and neurons at the antennal lobe. This modulates olfactory discrimination, promotes the avoidance of bacteria-laced food and increases fly survival. Although transient in young flies, gut-induced metabolic reprogramming of ensheathing glia becomes constitutive in old flies owing to age-related intestinal inflammation, which contributes to an age-related decline in olfactory discrimination. Our findings identify adaptive glial metabolic reprogramming by gut-derived cytokines as a mechanism that causes lasting changes in a sensory system in ageing flies.","Cai, Xiaoyu Tracy; Li, Hongjie; Borch Jensen, Martin; Maksoud, Elie; Borneo, Jovencio; Liang, Yuxin; Quake, Stephen R; Luo, Liqun; Haghighi, Pejmun; Jasper, Heinrich",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03756-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34290404/,513

Recent studies on organ reengineering for orthotopic transplantation have provided a new avenue for isolating purified native matrix to use for growing cells. Whether human lung cancer cells grown in a decellularized rat lung matrix would create perfusable human lung cancer nodules was tested. METHODS Rat lungs were harvested and native cells were removed using sodium dodecyl sulfate and Triton X-100 in a decellularization chamber to create a decellularized rat lung matrix. Human A549, H460, or H1299 lung cancer cells were placed into the decellularized rat lung matrix and grown in a customized bioreactor with perfusion of oxygenated media for 7 to 14 days. RESULTS Decellularized rat lung matrix showed preservation of matrix architecture devoid of all rat cells. All three human lung cancer cell lines grown in the bioreactor developed tumor nodules with intact vasculature. Moreover, the lung cancer cells developed a pattern of growth similar to the original human lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS Overall, this study shows that human lung cancer cells form perfusable tumor nodules in a customized bioreactor on a decellularized rat lung matrix created by a customized decellularization chamber. The lung cancer cells grown in the matrix had features similar to the original human lung cancer. This ex vivo model can be used potentially to gain a deeper understanding of the biologic processes involved in human lung cancer.","Mishra, Dhruva K; Thrall, Michael J; Baird, Brandi N; Ott, Harald C; Blackmon, Shanda H; Kurie, Jonathan M; Kim, Min P",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2012.01.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22385822/,513

Using specific PCR, SealAV was identified in lung tissue from two of five animals involved in the 2000 mortality event, as well as one of 20 harbor seal samples examined post-mortem in 2008. The identification of SealAV in multiple years demonstrates that this virus is persistent in the harbor seal population. SealAV is the second anellovirus reported in the lungs of pinnipeds, suggesting that anellovirus infections may be common amongst marine mammals and that more research is needed to understand the roles of these viruses in marine mammal health and disease.","Ng, Terry Fei Fan; Wheeler, Elizabeth; Greig, Denise; Waltzek, Thomas B; Gulland, Frances; Breitbart, Mya",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.029678-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21402596/,513

Although a causative agent has not been formally demonstrated, the leading candidate is a novel avian bornavirus (ABV) detected in post-mortem tissue samples of psittacids with PDD from the USA, Israel and, recently, Germany. Here we describe the presence of ABV in a parrot with PDD as well as in clinically normal birds exposed to birds with PDD. In two ABV-positive post-mortem cases, the tissue distribution of ABV was investigated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Viraemia was observed in a PDD-affected bird whereas a restriction of ABV to nerve tissue was found in the non-PDD-affected bird. Healthy birds from the same aviary as the affected birds were also found to harbour the virus; 19/59 (32.2%) birds tested positive for ABV RNA in cloacal swabs, providing the first evidence of ABV in clinically healthy birds. In contrast, 39 birds from the same geographic area, but from two different aviaries without PDD cases in recent years, had negative cloacal swabs. ABV RNA-positive, clinically healthy birds demonstrated the same serological response as the animal with confirmed PDD. These results indicate that ABV infection may occur without clinical evidence of PDD and suggest that cloacal swabs can enable the non-invasive detection of ABV infection.","Lierz, Michael; Hafez, Hafez M; Honkavuori, Kirsi S; Gruber, Achim D; Olias, Philipp; Abdelwhab, Elsayed M; Kohls, Andrea; Lipkin, W Ian; Briese, Thomas; Hauck, Ruediger",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079450903349238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19937538/,513
91693,Progress in research on the detection of the novel coronavirus in human samples of different groups.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Stroke disproportionately affects people in low-income and middle-income countries. Although improvements in stroke care and outcomes have been reported in high-income countries, little is known about practice and outcomes in low and middle-income countries. We aimed to compare patterns of care available and their association with patient outcomes across countries at different economic levels. METHODS We studied the patterns and effect of practice variations (ie, treatments used and access to services) among participants in the INTERSTROKE study, an international observational study that enrolled 13 447 stroke patients from 142 clinical sites in 32 countries between Jan 11, 2007, and Aug 8, 2015. We supplemented patient data with a questionnaire about health-care and stroke service facilities at all participating hospitals. Using univariate and multivariate regression analyses to account for patient casemix and service clustering, we estimated the association between services available, treatments given, and patient outcomes (death or dependency) at 1 month. FINDINGS We obtained full information for 12 342 (92%) of 13 447 INTERSTROKE patients, from 108 hospitals in 28 countries; 2576 from 38 hospitals in ten high-income countries and 9766 from 70 hospitals in 18 low and middle-income countries. Patients in low-income and middle-income countries more often had severe strokes, intracerebral haemorrhage, poorer access to services, and used fewer investigations and treatments (p<0·0001) than those in high-income countries, although only differences in patient characteristics explained the poorer clinical outcomes in low and middle-income countries. However across all countries, irrespective of economic level, access to a stroke unit was associated with improved use of investigations and treatments, access to other rehabilitation services, and improved survival without severe dependency (odds ratio [OR] 1·29; 95% CI 1·14-1·44; all p<0·0001), which was independent of patient casemix characteristics and other measures of care. Use of acute antiplatelet treatment was associated with improved survival (1·39; 1·12-1·72) irrespective of other patient and service characteristics. INTERPRETATION Evidence-based treatments, diagnostics, and stroke units were less commonly available or used in low and middle-income countries. Access to stroke units and appropriate use of antiplatelet treatment were associated with improved recovery. Improved care and facilities in low-income and middle-income countries are essential to improve outcomes.

We report a cluster of COVID-19 cases among the Maya in Alameda County, California, most of whom were misclassified in public health data as nonindigenous Spanish-speaking people. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all COVID-19 tests performed from April 1 through May 31, 2020, at Alameda Health System. A total of 1561 tests from 1533 patients were performed, with an overall test positivity rate of 17.0% (N = 265). We used the language field from the electronic health record to identify 29 patients as speaking an indigenous Mayan language; by medical record review, we identified 52 additional Maya patients. Maya patients had a test positivity rate of 72.8% as compared with 27.1% (P < .001) for nonindigenous Latinx patients and 8.2% (P < .001) for all other patients. In our sample, 39.6% of patients who had a positive test result for COVID-19 were hospitalized, 11.3% required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 4.9% died of COVID-19. Maya patients had lower rates of hospitalization, ICU admission, and 30-day in-hospital mortality than non-Maya patients. We shared our data with the county health department to inform responses for education, testing, and isolation for Maya patients in Alameda County. Ongoing COVID-19 public health efforts should assess the community prevalence of COVID-19 in the Maya community and other indigenous communities and implement interventions that are linguistically and culturally appropriate.","Foo, Patricia K; Perez, Berenice; Gupta, Neha; Lorenzo, Gerardo Jeronimo; Misa, Nana-Yaa; Gutierrez, Brissa Santacruz; Madison, Olivia; B Swift, U Mini; Anderson, Erik S",Public health reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/0033354921990370; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33593141/,513

OBJECTIVE We aimed to examine anxiety, depression, and musculoskeletal complaints that may occur in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Data were cross-sectional, collected by the online questionnaire method consisted of demographic questions, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Nordic Musculoskeletal System Query (NMQ), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). RESULTS Among the groups, the number of doctors in the frontline group, the fear of being infected, the number of tests performed, and personal protective equipment were higher than the second-line group (p < 0.05). It was found that 73.4%of the participants had anxiety, 83.5%had depression, and 94.9%had musculoskeletal pain. It was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the applied scale scores between the groups (p > 0.05). About musculoskeletal system complaints of the participants, neck pain presence was determined as 73.4%in the last 12 months, and upper back pain was the highest with 61.4%in the last week. Neck (p < 0.005) and upper back pain (p = 0.04) parameters in the last seven days of the NMQ scale applied to the participants were found to be statistically significantly higher in the contact group. CONCLUSIONS Anxiety, depression, and musculoskeletal pain of healthcare workers were found to be high. While neck and back pain was the most common in musculoskeletal complaints, it was found that these pains were higher in the frontline group. In this regard, healthcare professionals can be given psychological support and exercise training.","Arca, Muhammed; Dönmezdil, Süleyman; Durmaz, Elif Dilara",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-205014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34024799/,513

An understanding of SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics in children would enable data-driven public health guidance. METHODS Respiratory swabs were collected from children with COVID-19. Viral load was quantified by RT-PCR; viral culture was assessed by direct observation of cytopathic effects and semiquantitative viral titers. Correlations with age, symptom duration, and disease severity were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences were compared with contemporaneous sequences. RESULTS 110 children with COVID-19 (median age 10 years, range 2 weeks-21 years) were included in this study. Age did not impact SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Children were most infectious within the first five days of illness, and severe disease did not correlate with increased viral loads. Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 sequences were representative of those in the community and novel variants were identified. CONCLUSIONS Symptomatic and asymptomatic children can carry high quantities of live, replicating SARS-CoV-2, creating a potential reservoir for transmission and evolution of genetic variants. As guidance around social distancing and masking evolves following vaccine uptake in older populations, a clear understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in children is critical for rational development of public health policies and vaccination strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.","Yonker, Lael M; Boucau, Julie; Regan, James; Choudhary, Manish C; Burns, Madeleine D; Young, Nicola; Farkas, Eva J; Davis, Jameson P; Moschovis, Peter P; Kinane, T Bernard; Fasano, Alessio; Neilan, Anne M; Li, Jonathan Z; Barczak, Amy K",The Journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34647601/,513

We describe our initial experience using SILS for the management of colorectal disease and present preliminary short-term results. Between February 2010 and April 2011, 7 patients (4 females and 3 males, mean age 55 years, range 32–74) underwent SILS for either benign or malignant colorectal disease. Preoperative diagnosis was diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon in two patients, malignant polyps of the sigmoid colon in two other patients and large villous tumor of the right colon in three patients. Surgical procedures, 4 anterior resections of the rectum and 3 right hemicolectomies, were performed through a 3 cm single umbilical incision using a SILS multi port device with conventional or articulated laparoscopic instruments. There were no intraoperative complications or conversions in the standard laparoscopic procedure. The mean operative time for anterior resections was 160.0 ± 10.6 min, whereas it was 160.6 ± 20 for right hemicolectomies. Blood loss was minimal. No postoperative complications were reported in any of the patients. The overall mean hospital stay was 4.8 ± 0.2 days (range 4–5). For the subset of patients with malignant or pre-malignant disease, the mean number of retrieved lymph nodes was 15.6 ± 4.4 (range 6–31). Cosmetic results were considered excellent by all the patients after 15 days. In conclusion, our preliminary experience shows that SILS for colorectal disease is feasible and safe with potential reproducible oncologic results.","Cianchi, Fabio; Qirici, Etleva; Trallori, Giacomo; Mallardi, Beatrice; Badii, Benedetta; Perigli, Giuliano",Updates in surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13304-011-0112-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21976113/,513

METHODS A scoping review and a review of current guidance and guidelines provided by professional bodies, representing relevant discipline groups for cancer supportive care, were conducted. RESULTS We identified 19 papers and 23 telehealth guidance documents. The results highlight how the characteristics of patient group and healthcare provider influence the acceptability and utility of the service and establish a minimum set of preconditions. The reviews primarily examined patient-focused difficulties or issues with acceptability and efficacy, with only a minority highlighting how provider issues might also be implicated. By contrast, the guidance and guidelines described a need to address skills gaps in providing and receiving support through telehealth. CONCLUSION The capacity and willingness of services to adapt, in the context of COVID-19, is reassuring. It is important that the impact of the move to telehealth on service quality is assessed and systems put in place to ensure sustainability, acceptability, and adaptability.

To contain the diffusion of infection, several governments have enforced restrictions on outdoor activities on the population. Today, we are witnessing the so-called ""second wave"" COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) with an increasing number of cases similar to the one reported at the beginning of the current year. It is plausible that further restrictions will be applied to contain the ""second wave"" of infections. The present commentary evaluated the effects of stress on lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic in women. We briefly suggest practical recommendations for women to reduce stress and recovery for a healthy lifestyle after quarantine. Quarantine is associated with stress and depression, which lead to unhealthy lifestyle, including unhealthy diet, smoking, alcohol, and reduced physical activity. Women are more likely to suffer from depression and stress and quarantine has acted as a trigger.

Such a collective decision emerges from the competition between pheromone trails leading to different resources but also between the recruiting stimuli emitted by successful foragers at nest entrances. In this study, we investigated how an additional nest entrance influences the ability of Myrmica rubra ant colonies to exploit two food sources of different quality (1M and 0.1M sucrose solution) and to select the most rewarding one. We found that the mobilisation of workers doubled in two-entrance nests compared to one-entrance nests but that ants were less likely to reach a food source once they exited the nest. Moreover, the collective selection of the most rewarding food source was less marked in two-entrance nests, with foragers distributing themselves evenly between the two feeders. Ultimately, multiple nest entrances reduced the foraging efficiency of ant colonies that consumed significantly less sugar out of the two available resources. Our results highlight that the nest structure, more specifically the number of nest entrances, can impede the ant's ability to process information about environmental opportunities and to select the most rewarding resource. This study opens new insights on how the physical interface between the nest interior and the outside environment can act upon collective decision-making and foraging efficiency in self-organized insect societies.","Lehue, Marine; Detrain, Claire",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609769/,513

However, the relationship between aerosol characteristics and wastewater treatment process remains poorly understood. In this study, aerosols were collected over a 24-month period from a WWTP using a modified anaerobic-anoxic-oxic process. The aerated tank (AerT) was characterized by the highest respiratory fraction (RF) concentrations (861-1525 CFU/m3) and proportions (50.76%-65.96%) of aerosol particles. Fourteen core potential pathogens and 15 toxic metal(loid)s were identified in aerosols. Mycobacterium was the genus that aerosolized most easily in fine grid, pre-anoxic tank, and AerT. High wastewater treatment efficiency may increase the emission of RF and core potential pathogens. The median size of activated sludge, richness of core potential pathogens in wastewater, and total suspended particulates were the most influential factors directly related to the RF proportions, core community of potential pathogens, and composition of toxic metal(loid)s in WWTP aerosols, respectively. Relative humidity, temperature, input and removal of biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, and mixed liquor suspended solids could also directly or indirectly affect the aerosol characteristics. This study enhances the mechanistic understanding of linking aerosol characteristics to treatment processes and has important implications for targeted manipulation.","Yang, Tang; Jiang, Lu; Han, Yunping; Liu, Jianwei; Wang, Xiaodong; Yan, Xu; Liu, Junxin",Environmental pollution,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114741; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32402711/,513

One of the most popular is the transanal approach for rectal lesions. The aims of this study were to report how we standardized NOTES technique for transanal mesorectal excision without abdominal assistance, discuss the difficulties and surgical outcomes of this technique and report its feasibility in a small group of selected patients. METHODS Three consecutive female patients underwent transanal NOTES rectal resection without transabdominal laparoscopic assistance for rectal lesions. Functional results were assessed with the Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life scale and the Wexner score. RESULTS The technical steps are described in details and complemented with a video. All procedures were completed without transabdominal laparoscopic help. The mesorectal plane was entirely dissected without any disruption, and distal and circumferential margins were tumor-free. No major complications were observed. Functional results show a significant impairment after surgery with improvement at 6 months to levels near those of the preoperative period. CONCLUSIONS The performance and publication of NOTES procedures are subject to much discussion. Despite the small number of patients, this procedure appears feasible and can be accomplished maintaining fecal continence and respecting oncologic principles.","Leão, P; Goulart, A; Veiga, C; Cristino, H; Marcos, N; Correia-Pinto, J; Rodrigues, M; Moreno-Sanz, C",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-015-1343-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26194921/,513

We aimed at evaluating its prognostic role. METHODS We retrospectively collected data of COVID patients admitted to our ED between March 16th and April 22nd, 2020. The Novara-COVID score was systematically applied to all COVID patients since its introduction in clinical practice and adopted to decide patients' destination. The ability of the Novara-COVID score to predict in-hospital clinical stability and in-hospital mortality were evaluated through multivariable logistic regression and Cox Regression Hazard models, respectively. RESULTS Among the 480 COVID patients admitted to the ED, 338 were hospitalized: the Novara-COVID score was 0-1 in 49.7%, 2 in 24.6%, 3 in 15.4% and 4-5 in 10.3% of patients. Novara-COVID score values of 3 and 4-5 were associated with lower clinical stability with adjusted odds ratios of 0.28 [0.13-0.59] and 0.03 [0.01-0.12], respectively. When in-hospital mortality was evaluated, a significant difference emerged between scores of 0-1 and 2 vs. 3 and 4-5. In particular, the death adjusted Hazard Ratio for Novara-COVID scores of 3 and 4-5 were 2.6 [1.4-4.8] and 8.4 [4.7-15.2], respectively.

106011,Possible prognostic biomarkers of periodontitis in saliva.,2021-04-01,"UNLABELLED A variety of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs have been developed for targeting of somatostatin receptor (sst)-positive tumors. Bicyclic somatostatin-based radiopeptides have not been studied yet. Hypothesizing that the introduction of conformational constraints may lead to receptor subtype selectivity or may help to delineate structural features determining pansomatostatin potency, we developed and evaluated first examples of this new class of potential radiotracers for imaging or therapy of neuroendocrine tumors. METHODS The bicyclic peptides were synthesized by standard solid-phase peptide synthesis. DOTA was coupled to the resin-assembled peptide for labeling with (177)Lu and (68)Ga. Binding affinity and receptor subtype profile were determined using human ssts. Ca(2+) flux, internalization, and efflux were studied in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-sst(2) and HEK-sst(3) cell lines. Biodistribution and PET/CT studies were performed in corresponding nude mice models. RESULTS Some of the new analogs showed high affinity for sst(2) and sst(3) and moderate affinity for sst(1), sst(4), and sst(5), while exhibiting agonistic properties. The analog AM3, comprising an octreotide ring and a head-to-tail-coupled Arg-diaminobutyric acid(DOTA) cycle, showed the highest receptor affinity and agonist potency. (177)Lu-AM3 showed high and receptor-mediated uptake in vivo in sst(2) and sst(3) tumors with low background. Kidneys were the only other tissue accumulating radioactivity that could be reduced by a preinjection of lysine. PET/CT studies of (68)Ga-AM3 at 1 h after injection were characterized by clear localization of the tumor, visualization of the kidneys, and negligible background. CONCLUSION The high rigidity of these new bicyclic somatostatin-based radiopeptides led to agonistic ligands with good affinity for all 5 ssts. The pharmacokinetic data of (177)Lu/(68)Ga-AM3 make this peptide an excellent candidate as an imaging--and especially as a PET--radiotracer.","Fani, Melpomeni; Mueller, Andreas; Tamma, Maria-Luisa; Nicolas, Guillaume; Rink, Hans R; Cescato, Renzo; Reubi, Jean Claude; Maecke, Helmut R","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.110.076695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20956465/,513
106839,Therapeutic potential of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in preventing cytokine storm in COVID-19: review of current evidence.,2021-03-01,"The effectiveness of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) for rehabilitation is proportional to the evoked torque. The progressive increase in torque (extra torque) that may develop in response to low intensity wide-pulse high-frequency (WPHF) NMES holds great promise for rehabilitation as it overcomes the main limitation of NMES, namely discomfort. WPHF NMES extra torque is thought to result from reflexively recruited motor units at the spinal level. However, whether WPHF NMES evoked force can be modulated is unknown. Therefore, we examined the effect of two interventions known to change the state of spinal circuitry in opposite ways on evoked torque and motor unit recruitment by WPHF NMES. The interventions were high-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and anodal transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS). We show that TENS performed before a bout of WPHF NMES results in lower evoked torque (median change in torque time-integral: - 56%) indicating that WPHF NMES-evoked torque might be modulated. In contrast, the anodal tsDCS protocol used had no effect on any measured parameter. Our results demonstrate that WPHF NMES extra torque can be modulated and although the TENS intervention blunted extra torque production, the finding that central contribution to WPHF NMES-evoked torques can be modulated opens new avenues for designing interventions to enhance WPHF NMES.","Donnelly, Chris; Stegmüller, Jonathan; Blazevich, Anthony J; Crettaz von Roten, Fabienne; Kayser, Bengt; Neyroud, Daria; Place, Nicolas",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85645-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737664/,513

To be effective, their atmospheric lifetimes must be sufficient that these signals can be delivered to their numerous recipients. We investigate the atmospheric loss processes for methyl salicylate (MeSA), a widely emitted plant volatile. Simulation chambers were used to determine gas-phase reaction rates with OH, NO3, Cl and O3; photolysis rates; and deposition rates of gas-phase MeSA onto organic aerosols. Room temperature rate coefficients are determined (in units of cm3 molecule-1 s-1) to be (3.20 ± 0.46) × 10-12, (4.19 ± 0.92) × 10-15, (1.65 ± 0.44) × 10-12 and (3.33 ± 2.01) × 10-19 for the reactions with OH, NO3, Cl and O3 respectively. Photolysis is negligible in the actinic range, despite having a large reported near-UV chromophore. Conversely, aerosol uptake can be competitive with oxidation under humid conditions, suggesting that this compound has a high affinity for hydrated surfaces. A total lifetime of gas-phase MeSA of 1-4 days was estimated based on all these loss processes. The competing sinks of MeSA demonstrate the need to assess lifetimes of semiochemicals holistically, and we gain understanding of how atmospheric sinks influence natural communication channels within complex multitrophic interactions. This approach can be extended to other compounds that play vital roles in ecosystems, such as insect pheromones, which may be similarly affected during atmospheric transport.","Ren, Yangang; McGillen, Max R; Daële, Véronique; Casas, Jérôme; Mellouki, Abdelwahid",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818857/,513

Globally, there has been a rapid proliferation of research studies and clinical trials assessing risks, infectivity and treatment. METHODS This review assesses the opportunities and challenges in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region to engage in the conduct of high quality clinical trials during the Covid-19 pandemic. RESULTS Opportunities are abundant for conducting clinical trials in MENA countries, including substantial cost savings, academic health centers, integrated health information systems, international accreditation, and international collaborations. Yet, the MENA region has missed out on opportunities to advance patient research during prior infectious disease outbreaks caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Ebola, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, as evidenced by the lack of concerted research and clinical trials from the region. A large vulnerable population, especially the poor expatriate work force, the current isolation of the health centers, and the lack of an expert network or field trained task force, all contribute to challenges preventing the formation of a pan Arab research enterprise for epidemics. CONCLUSION Quality clinical research is critical during public health emergencies to identify treatments and solutions.

110534,Short Report - Medical nutrition therapy for critically ill patients with COVID-19.,2020-04-01,"Multiple signaling pathways are engaged by the type I and II IFN receptors, but their specific roles and possible coordination in the generation of IFN-mediated biological responses remain unknown. We provide evidence that activation of Akt kinases is required for IFN-inducible engagement of the mTOR/p70 S6 kinase pathway. Our data establish that Akt activity is essential for up-regulation of key IFN-alpha- and IFN-gamma-inducible proteins, which have important functional consequences in the induction of IFN responses. Such effects of the Akt pathway are unrelated to regulatory activities on IFN-dependent STAT phosphorylation/activation or transcriptional regulation. By contrast, they reflect regulatory activities on mRNA translation via direct control of the mTOR pathway. In studies using Akt1 and Akt2 double knockout cells, we found that the absence of Akt kinases results in dramatic reduction in IFN-induced antiviral responses, establishing a critical role of the Akt pathway in IFN signaling. Thus, activation of the Akt pathway by the IFN receptors complements the function of IFN-activated JAK-STAT pathways, by allowing mRNA translation of IFN-stimulated genes and, ultimately, the induction of the biological effects of IFNs.","Kaur, Surinder; Sassano, Antonella; Dolniak, Blazej; Joshi, Sonali; Majchrzak-Kita, Beata; Baker, Darren P; Hay, Nissim; Fish, Eleanor N; Platanias, Leonidas C",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0710907105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18339807/,513

With many scientific and humanitarian efforts ongoing to develop diagnostic tests, vaccines, and treatments for COVID-19, and to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, mass spectrometry research, including proteomics, is playing a role in determining the biology of this viral infection. Proteomics studies are starting to lead to an understanding of the roles of viral and host proteins during SARS-CoV-2 infection, their protein-protein interactions, and post-translational modifications. This is beginning to provide insights into potential therapeutic targets or diagnostic strategies that can be used to reduce the long-term burden of the pandemic. However, the extraordinary situation caused by the global pandemic is also highlighting the need to improve mass spectrometry data and workflow sharing. We therefore describe freely available data and computational resources that can facilitate and assist the mass spectrometry-based analysis of SARS-CoV-2. We exemplify this by reanalyzing a virus-host interactome data set to detect protein-protein interactions and identify host proteins that could potentially be used as targets for drug repurposing.","Bittremieux, Wout; Adams, Charlotte; Laukens, Kris; Dorrestein, Pieter C; Bandeira, Nuno",Journal of proteome research,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00929; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33605735/,513

The EGSnrc Monte Carlo software modules, BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc, were used to generate whole brain radiotherapy plans for a pediatric patient using two lateral opposing 40-MeV electron beams. Electron beam phase space files were simulated using a model of a diverging beam with a diameter of 10 cm at 50 cm SAD (defined at brain midline). The electron beams were collimated using a 10-cm-thick block composed of 5 cm of aluminum oxide and 5 cm of tungsten. For comparison, a 6-MV photon plan was calculated with the Varian AAA algorithm. Electron beam parameters were based on a novel linear accelerator designed for the PHASER system and powered by a commercial 6-MW klystron. Calculations of the linear accelerator's performance indicated an average beam current of at least 6.25 μA, providing a dose rate of 115 Gy/s at isocenter, high enough for cognition-sparing FLASH effects. The electron plan was less homogenous with a homogeneity index of 0.133 compared to the photon plan's index of 0.087. Overall, the dosimetric characteristics of the 40-MeV electron plan were suitable for treatment. In conclusion, Monte Carlo simulations performed in this work indicate that two lateral opposing 40-MeV electron beams can be used for pediatric whole brain irradiation at FLASH dose rates of 115 Gy/s and serve as motivation for a practical clinical FLASH radiotherapy system, which can be implemented in the near future.","Breitkreutz, Dylan Yamabe; Shumail, Muhammad; Bush, Karl K; Tantawi, Sami G; Maxim, Peter G; Loo, Billy W",Radiation research,https://doi.org/10.1667/rade-20-00069.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991725/,513

DESIGN A repeated-measures design was used to evaluate the auditory-visual recognition of sentences recorded in background noise with transparent and opaque face masks, and without a mask (N=154). In a smaller follow-up study (N=29), the same files were presented via auditory-only presentation to determine if differences observed in the transparent and opaque mask conditions were attributable to additional visual cues or to acoustic differences between the recordings of the two mask types. Listeners completed the 40-minute online session on a computer, laptop, or tablet in a quiet room via their personal listening devices (earbuds or hearing assistive device). The adult volunteers who used English as their first language were recruited through social media links and email and categorized into three groups: normal hearing and confirmed or suspected hearing loss either with or without the use of assistive listening devices. RESULTS Auditory-visual recognition of sentences recorded with the transparent mask was significantly better (M=68.9%) than for sentences recorded with the opaque mask (M=58.9%) for all participants. There was a trend for those who used hearing assistive technology to score lower than the other two groups who had similar performance across all conditions regardless of mask type. Subjective ratings of confidence and concentration followed the expected pattern based on objective scores. Results of the auditory-only presentation of the sentences to listeners with normal hearing suggested that the transparent-mask benefits were not attributable to an acoustic advantage but rather to the addition of the visual cues of the talker's face available through the transparent mask. In fact, performance in the auditory-only presentation was significantly lower with the transparent mask (M=40.7%) compared to the opaque mask (M=58.2%). CONCLUSIONS Use of transparent masks can significantly facilitate speech recognition in noise even for persons with normal hearing and thus may reduce stressful communication challenges experienced in medical, employment, and educational settings during the global pandemic. To mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and facilitate communication, safety-approved transparent masks are strongly encouraged over opaque masks.","Thibodeau, Linda M; Thibodeau-Nielsen, Rachel B; Tran, Chi Mai Quynh; de Souza Jacob, Regina Tangerino",Ear and hearing,https://doi.org/10.1097/aud.0000000000001065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33813522/,513

An improvement of the volatile suspended solids (VSS) solubilization along with an increase in protein, carbohydrate, reducing sugar and nitrogen concentrations were demonstrated after alkali and thermo-alkali hydrolysis. In contrast, the application of acidic and thermo-acidic pretreatments reduced the organic matter hydrolysis. Compared to untreated wastewater, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) solubilization and the heavy metal concentration, except manganese, were enhanced in all the chemically pretreated wastewaters. Although its low contribution in the solubilization of the wastewater organic matter, the acidic-pretreated wastewater showed the highest performance in supporting P. temperata biopesticide production. Indeed, using the acidic-pretreated wastewater as a fermentation medium decreased the lag phase, enhanced the growth of the strain K122 to reach a final biomass production of 20 × 108 cells/mL, increased culturable cell count to 262 × 106 cells/mL and improved oral toxicity against Ephestia kuehniella larvae by 68.4%.

OBJECTIVE To describe the technique and report the surgical outcomes of LESS radical nephrectomy (RN) in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS LESS-RN was performed in 33 patients with renal tumours. The indications to perform a LESS-RN were represented by renal tumours not greater than T2 and without evidence of lymphadenopathy or renal vein involvement. SURGICAL PROCEDURE The Endocone (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) was inserted through a transumbilical incision. A combination of standard laparoscopic instruments and bent grasper and scissors was used. The sequence of steps of LESS-RN was comparable to standard laparoscopic RN. MEASUREMENTS Demographic data and perioperative and postoperative variables were recorded and analysed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The mean operative time was 143.7±24.3 min, with a mean estimated blood loss of 122.3±34.1 ml and a mean hospital stay of 3.8±0.8 d. The mean length of skin incision was 4.1±0.6 cm and all patients were discharged from hospital with minimal discomfort, as demonstrated by their pain assessment scores (visual analogue scale: 1.9±0.8). The definitive pathologic results revealed a renal cell carcinoma in all cases and a stage distribution of four T1a, 27 T1b, and 2 T2 tumours. All patients were very satisfied with the appearance of the scars, and at a median follow-up period of 13.2±3.9 mo, all patients were alive without evidence of tumour recurrence or port-site metastasis. CONCLUSIONS LESS is a safe and feasible surgical procedure for RN in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and has excellent cosmetic results.","Greco, Francesco; Veneziano, Domenico; Wagner, Sigrid; Kawan, Felix; Mohammed, Nasreldin; Hoda, M Raschid; Fornara, Paolo",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2011.10.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22030118/,513

For this reason, rapid analytical methods to seize heroin samples in the field are of paramount importance to hinder drug trafficking, and thus prevent the availability of heroin in the drug market. The present work reports on the enriched electrochemical fingerprint of heroin, allowing its selective detection in street samples, based on the use of electrochemical pretreated screen printed electrodes (p-SPE). The voltammetric identification is built on two oxidation peaks of both heroin and its degradation product 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM), generated in alkaline conditions. Interestingly, an anodic pretreatment of the screen printed electrodes (SPE) shifts the peak potential of paracetamol (the most encountered cutting agent in heroin seizures), allowing the detection of 6-MAM peak, overlapping with the paracetamol signal in the case of untreated SPE. Subsequently, the characterization of the p-SPE with scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is provided to demonstrate local changes on the surface of the electrode. From an analytical perspective, p-SPE provide higher sensitivity (0.019 μA μM-1), excellent reproducibility (6-MAM, RSD = 2.85%, and heroin RSD = 0.91%, n = 5) and lower limits of detection (LOD) (5.2 μM) in comparison to untreated SPE. The proposed protocol which integrates a tailor-made script is interrogated against common cutting agents, and finally, validated with the screening of 14 street samples, also analyzed by standard methods. Besides, a comparison with portable spectroscopic techniques on the confiscated samples shows the better performance of the electrochemical strategy. Overall, this sensing approach offers promising results for the rapid on-site profiling of suspicious heroin samples, also in the presence of paracetamol.","Felipe Montiel, Noelia; Parrilla, Marc; Beltrán, Victoria; Nuyts, Gert; Van Durme, Filip; De Wael, Karolien",Talanta,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.122005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33676638/,513

The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of robot-assisted resection in patients with Stage IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or carcinoid tumours in the series as a whole and in different subgroups according to adjuvant treatment. METHODS This was a retrospective multicentre study of consecutive patients with clinically evident or occult N2 disease (210 NSCLC and 13 carcinoid) who, in 2007-2016, underwent robot-assisted resection at 7 high-volume centres. Perioperative outcomes, recurrences and overall survival were assessed. RESULTS N2 disease was diagnosed preoperatively in 72 (32%) patients and intraoperatively in 151 (68%) patients. Surgical margins were negative in 98.4% of cases with available data. Thirty-four (15.2%) patients received neoadjuvant treatment, 140 (63%) patients received postoperative treatment, and 49 (22%) patients underwent surgery only. There were 22 (9.9%) conversions to thoracotomy, 23 (10.3%) had serious (Grades III-IV) postoperative morbidity and the mean hospital stay was 5.3 days. Complications and outcomes did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Of the 34 patients who were given neoadjuvant chemotherapy, all had R0 resection, 5 (15%) patients required conversion but none required conversion because of bleeding and 4 (12%) patients had Grade III or IV postoperative complications. After a median of 18 (interquartile range 8-33) months, 3-year overall survival in NSCLC patients was 61.2% and 60.3% (P = 0.6) of patients in the subgroup were given induction treatment. However, overall survival was significantly better (P = 0.012) in NSCLC patients with ≤2 positive nodes (vs >2). Nineteen (8.5%) patients developed local recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Robot-assisted lobectomy is safe and effective in patients with Stage III NSCLC or carcinoid tumours with low conversions and complications.

126275,Different approaches to the analysis of causes of death during the COVID-19 epidemic.,2021-05-01,"In patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) referred for lung scintigraphy for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), there has been an ongoing debate within the nuclear medicine community as to whether and when the ventilation study should be performed. Indeed, while PE diagnosis typically relies on the recognition of ventilation/perfusion (V/P) mismatched defects, the ventilation procedure potentially increases the risk of contamination to the healthcare workers. The primary aim of this study was to assess the role of ventilation imaging when performing lung scintigraphy for suspected PE in COVID-19 patients. The secondary aim was to describe practices and imaging findings in this specific population. Methods: A national registry was created in collaboration with the French Society of Nuclear Medicine to collect lung scans performed in COVID-19 patients for suspected PE. Practices of departments were assessed regarding imaging protocols and aerosol precautions. A retrospective review of V/P SPECT/CT scans was then conducted. Two physicians blinded to clinical information reviewed each case by sequentially using P SPECT, P SPECT/CT and V/P SPECT/CT images. Scans were classified in one of the four following categories: patients for whom PE could reasonably be excluded based on 1) perfusion SPECT only, 2) P SPECT/CT, 3) V/P SPECT/CT; or 4) patients with mismatched defects suggestive of PE according to the EANM criteria. Results: Data from 12 French nuclear medicine departments were collected. Lung scans were performed between 03/2020 and 04/2021. Personal protective equipment and dedicated cleaning procedures were used in all departments. Out of the 145 V/Q SPECT/CT included in the central review, PE could be excluded using only P SPECT, P SPECT/CT and V/P SPECT/CT in 27 (19%), 55 (38%) and 45 (31%) patients, respectively. V/P SPECT/CT was positive for PE in 18 (12%) patients, including 12 (67%) with a low burden of PE (≤10%). Conclusion: In this population of COVID-19 patients assessed with lung scintigraphy, PE could be confidently excluded without ventilation in only 57% of patients. Ventilation imaging was required to confidently rule out PE in 31% of patients. Overall, the prevalence of PE was low (12%).","Le Roux, Pierre-Yves; Bonnefoy, Pierre-Benoit; Bahloul, Achraf; Denizot, Benoit; Barres, Bertrand; Moreau-Triby, Caroline; Girma, Astrid; Pallardy, Amandine; Ceyrat, Quentin; Sarda-Mantel, Laure; Razzouk-Cadet, Micheline; Zsigmond, Reka; Florent, Cachin; Karcher, Gilles; Salaun, Pierre-Yves","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.121.262955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34649944/,513

FBoV was detected by PCR in 7.2, 0.3, 1.6, 2.0 and 0.8% of faecal, nasal, urine, kidney and blood samples, respectively, from 364 cats, while CBoV was detected in 4.6, 5.1, 6.3 and 0.3% of faecal, nasal, urine and blood samples, respectively, from 351 dogs. Three FBoV genomes sequenced revealed the presence of three ORFs characteristic of bocaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that FBoVs were related only distantly to other bocaviruses, forming a distinct cluster within the genus, with ≤ 5.7% nucleotide identities to the genome of minute virus of canines. The four CBoV genomes sequenced shared 87.4-89.2% nucleotide identities with that of CBoV strain Con-161. In addition to the three bocavirus ORFs, they encoded an additional ORF, ORF4, immediately downstream of the ORF for non-structural protein 1 (NS1), which was not found in other bocaviruses including CBoV strain Con-161. They also possessed a putative second exon encoding the C-terminal region of NS1 and conserved RNA-splicing signals, previously described in human bocaviruses. Partial VP1/VP2 sequence analysis of 23 FBoV and 25 CBoV strains demonstrated inter-host genetic diversity, with two potential genetic groups of FBoV and a novel CBoV group, CBoV-HK, distinct from the three groups, CBoV-A to -C, found in the USA. Although the pathogenicity of FBoV and CBoV remains to be determined, their presence in different host tissues suggested wide tissue tropism.","Lau, Susanna K P; Woo, Patrick C Y; Yeung, Hazel C; Teng, Jade L L; Wu, Ying; Bai, Ru; Fan, Rachel Y Y; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.042531-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22495233/,513

MATERIAL AND METHODS 302 patients with end-stage osteoarthritis scheduled for primary non-complex TKA were randomly divided into two prospective groups: in group I (N=102) the capsule of the knee joint and subcutaneous fat tissues were closed by continuous braided suture while in group II (N=200) by bidirectional knotless barbed sutures. The skin in both groups was closed by non-absorbable monofilament polycaproamide uninterrupted suture. RESULTS The time of the surgery was significantly shorter in group II (65,25±11,9 min) than in group I (72,5±14,7 min) (p<0.05). The volume of hidden blood loss was similar in both groups. The number of patients with superficial infection during the first two week after surgery did not differ significantly (1,9% (I) and 1% (II)): they all healed successfully after skin debridement and additional closure. There were no cases of deep periprosthetic infection (PPI). At 3-month follow-up no difference found regarding pain level and knee function (Knee Society Score). CONCLUSION The use of bidirectional knotless barbed sutures in TKA reduces the time of surgery, does not affect the volume of hidden blood loss or PPI occurrence.","Chugaev, D V; Kornilov, N N; Lasunskii, S A",Khirurgiia,https://doi.org/10.17116/hirurgia20171258-65; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29286032/,513

Despite treatment, the disease often progresses, causing severe morbidity and mortality, making novel treatment strategies necessary. Due to the regenerative actions of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), they have been proposed as a treatment for NIDCM. This systematic review aims to evaluate efficacy and mode of action (MoA) of MSC-based therapies in NIDCM. A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline (Pubmed) and Embase. A total of 27 studies were included (3 clinical trials and 24 preclinical studies). MSCs from different tissues and routes of delivery were reported, with bone marrow-derived MSCs and direct intramyocardial injections being the most frequent. All included clinical trials and 22 preclinical trials reported an improvement in cardiac function following MSC treatment. Furthermore, preclinical studies demonstrated alterations in tissue structure, gene, and protein expression patterns, primarily related to fibrosis and angiogenesis. Consequently, MSC treatment can improve cardiac function in NIDCM patients. The MoA underlying this effect involves anti-fibrosis, angiogenesis, immunomodulation, and anti-apoptosis, though these processes seem to be interdependent. These encouraging results calls for larger confirmatory clinical studies, as well as preclinical studies utilizing unbiased investigation of the potential MoA.","Hoeeg, Cecilie; Frljak, Sabina; Qayyum, Abbas Ali; Vrtovec, Bojan; Kastrup, Jens; Ekblond, Annette; Follin, Bjarke",Biomedicines,https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines8120570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33291410/,513

Microfluidics can generate LNPs with precisely defined properties, but have been limited by challenges in scaling throughput. To address this challenge, we present a scalable, parallelized microfluidic device (PMD) that incorporates an array of 128 mixing channels that operate simultaneously. The PMD achieves a >100× production rate compared to single microfluidic channels, without sacrificing desirable LNP physical properties and potency typical of microfluidic-generated LNPs. In mice, we show superior delivery of LNPs encapsulating either Factor VII siRNA or luciferase-encoding mRNA generated using a PMD compared to conventional mixing, with a 4-fold increase in hepatic gene silencing and 5-fold increase in luciferase expression, respectively. These results suggest that this PMD can generate scalable and reproducible LNP formulations needed for emerging clinical applications, including RNA therapeutics and vaccines.","Shepherd, Sarah J; Warzecha, Claude C; Yadavali, Sagar; El-Mayta, Rakan; Alameh, Mohamad-Gabriel; Wang, Lili; Weissman, Drew; Wilson, James M; Issadore, David; Mitchell, Michael J",Nano letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c01353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34189917/,513

Therefore, the increased request for support and assistance represents a critical challenge for clinicians requiring a reorganization of care systems. In this regard, online counselling has been identified as a useful tool in providing psychological assistance and support. Thus, the main purpose of the current study was to investigate the clinical usefulness of a single online counselling session in reducing psychopathological symptoms (i.e., state anxiety and negative affect) and increasing individual well-being and positive affect during the first Italian lockdown. Fifty-three subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive an online counselling session (Online Counselling Group; OCG= 26) or to act as controls (Waiting List Group; WLG= 27). In the post-assessment, compared to WLG, the OCG showed a significant decrease in negative affect (18.04±6.30 vs 30.26±8.61; F1:47 = 29.448; p< .001; dppc2 = .92) and state anxiety (36.65±8.35 vs 48.04±11.51; F1:47 = 17.857; p< .001; dppc2 = .49).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The livers of 28 rats underwent US-guided RF ablation. In four animals, contrast-enhanced US was performed during ablation and 2 hours and 2, 7, 14, and 21 days after ablation. The unenhanced zone area on US images was measured. DiI-labeled microbubbles were administered during ablation at 2, 4, and 6 minutes or at 2 hours and 2, 7, 14, and 21 days after ablation in the remaining 24 animals (n = 3 at each time point). One minute later, the animal was euthanized, and the ablated liver was harvested. Tissue samples were imaged to quantify total fluorescence, and NADH staining was performed on the same slice. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was also performed. The findings on fluorescence images, NADH-stained images, and hematoxylin-eosin-stained images were compared. The areas of DiI bubble-negative zones, NADH-negative zones, and lightly NADH-staining zones were measured. Data were analyzed by using one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS The area of the unenhanced zone on contrast-enhanced US images increased during RF ablation and reached a maximum within 2 days after ablation. At histopathologic examination, a transition zone manifested adjacent to the coagulation zone until 2 days after ablation. The DiI-bubble negative zone on fluorescence images and the damaged zone (transition zone plus coagulation zone) on NADH-stained images increased rapidly within 2 hours after ablation, then slowly reached the maximum on day 2. The ratios of the mean areas of these two zones at hour 2 to those at day 2 were 94.6% and 95.6%, respectively. High uniformity between the damaged zone on NADH-stained images and the DiI bubble-negative zone on fluorescence images was noted at all time points. CONCLUSION The temporary transition zone in NADH staining is partially damaged and should transition to nonviability 2 days after ablation. These results demonstrate that contrast-enhanced US can help delineate the maximum area of cell damage (to within 5% of the maximum) as early as 2 hours after ablation. Contrast-enhanced US may be a simple and accurate tool for monitoring the effects of RF ablation and quantifying the size of thermal damage after treatment.","Wu, Hanping; Wilkins, Luke R; Ziats, Nicholas P; Haaga, John R; Exner, Agata A",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.13121999; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23912621/,513

OBJECTIVE We aimed to iteratively devise protocols and processes that minimized HCW exposure while safely and effectively caring for children who may require unanticipated aerosol-generating procedures. METHODS As part of our PED's initiative to optimize clinical care and HCW safety during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, regular multidisciplinary systems and process simulation sessions were conducted. These sessions allowed us to evaluate and reorganize patient flow, test and improve communication modalities, alter the process for consultation in resuscitations, and teach and reinforce the appropriate donning and use of personal protective equipment. RESULTS Simulation was a highly effective method to disseminate new practices to PED staff. Numerous workflow modifications were implemented as a result of our in situ systems and process simulations. Total number of persons in the resuscitation room was minimized, use of a ""command post"" with remote providers was initiated, communication devices and strategies were trialed and adopted, and personal protective equipment standards that optimized HCW safety and communication were enacted. CONCLUSIONS Simulation can be an effective and agile tool in restructuring patient workflow and care of the most critically ill or injured patients in a PED during a novel pandemic.","Lavoie, Megan E; Tay, Khoon-Yen; Good, Grace; Buchhalter, Lillian; Abbadessa, Mary Kate; Gaines, Shannon; Myers, Sage",Pediatric emergency care,https://doi.org/10.1097/pec.0000000000002384; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33903290/,513
133983,Post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis: therapeutic efficacy using with mesenchymal stem cells - How the lung heals.,2021-03-01,"The molecular mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis remains obscure. Life and/or environmental events, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), high-fat diet (HFD), and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), are proposed exogenous risk factors for AD. BDNF/TrkB, an essential neurotrophic signaling for synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, are reduced in the aged brain and in AD patients. Here, we show that environmental factors activate C/EBPβ, an inflammatory transcription factor, which subsequently up-regulates δ-secretase that simultaneously cleaves both APP and Tau, triggering AD neuropathological changes. These adverse effects are additively exacerbated in BDNF+/- or TrkB+/- mice. Strikingly, TBI provokes both senile plaque deposit and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) formation in TrkB+/- mice, associated with augmented neuroinflammation and extensive neuronal loss, leading to cognitive deficits. Depletion of C/EBPβ inhibits TBI-induced AD-like pathologies in these mice. Remarkably, amyloid aggregates and NFT are tempospatially distributed in TrkB+/- mice brains after TBI, providing insight into their spreading in the progression of AD-like pathologies. Hence, our study revealed the roles of exogenous (TBI, HFD, and CCH) and endogenous (TrkB/BDNF) risk factors in the onset of AD-associated pathologies.","Wu, Zhourui; Chen, Chun; Kang, Seong Su; Liu, Xia; Gu, Xiaohuan; Yu, Shan Ping; Keene, C Dirk; Cheng, Liming; Ye, Keqiang",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2100986118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140411/,513

ALSPAC has followed these women, their partners (Generation 0; G0) and their offspring (Generation 1; G1) ever since. From 2012, ALSPAC has identified G1 participants who were pregnant (or their partner was) or had become parents, and enrolled them, their partners, and children in the ALSPAC-Generation 2 (ALSPAC-G2) study, providing a unique multi-generational cohort. At present, approximately 1,100 G2 children (excluding those in utero) from 810 G1 participants have been enrolled. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, ALSPAC rapidly deployed two online questionnaires; one during the initial lockdown phase in 2020 (9 th April-15 th May), and another when national lockdown restrictions were eased (26 th May-5 th July). As part of this second questionnaire, G1 parents completed a questionnaire about each of their G2 children. This covered: parental reports of children's feelings and behaviour since lockdown, school attendance, contact patterns, and health. A total of 289 G1 participants completed this questionnaire on behalf of 411 G2 children. This COVID-19 G2 questionnaire data can be combined with pre-pandemic ALSPAC-G2 data, plus ALSPAC-G1 and -G0 data, to understand how children's health and behaviour has been affected by the pandemic and its management. Data from this questionnaire will be complemented with linkage to health records and results of biological testing as they become available. Prospective studies are necessary to understand the impact of this pandemic on children's health and development, yet few relevant studies exist; this resource will aid these efforts.

QoL outcomes from the phase III PointBreak trial are reported. METHODS Chemonaive patients (n = 939) with stage IIIB/IV nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 1 were randomized (1:1) to pemetrexed-carboplatin-bevacizumab (pemetrexed arm) or paclitaxel-carboplatin-bevacizumab (paclitaxel arm). Patients without progressive disease received maintenance pemetrexed-bevacizumab (pemetrexed arm) or bevacizumab (paclitaxel arm). QoL was assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-General (FACT-G), FACT-Lung (FACT-L), and FACT/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (FACT-Ntx) instruments. Subscale scores, total scores, and trial outcome indices were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. Post hoc analyses examined the association between baseline FACT scores and overall survival (OS). RESULTS Mean score differences in change from baseline significantly favored the pemetrexed arm for the neurotoxicity subscale score, FACT-Ntx total scores, and FACT-Ntx trial outcome index. They occurred at cycle 2 (p < 0.001) and persisted through induction cycles 2 to 4 and six maintenance cycles. Investigator-assessed, qualitative, drug-related differences in grade 2 (1.6% versus 10.6%) and grade 3 (0.0% versus 4.1%) sensory neuropathy and grade 3/4 fatigue (10.9% versus 5.0%, p = 0.0012) were observed between the pemetrexed and paclitaxel arms. Baseline FACT-G, FACT-L, and FACT-Ntx scores were significant prognostic factors for OS (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Randomized patients reported similar changes in QoL, except for less change from baseline in neurotoxicity on the pemetrexed arm; investigators reported greater neurotoxicity on the paclitaxel arm and greater fatigue on the pemetrexed arm.

Yet the ability to characterize immune mechanisms of viral tolerance and to quantify infection dynamics in wild bats is often limited by small sample volumes and few species-specific reagents. Here, we demonstrate how proteomics can overcome these limitations by using data-independent acquisition-based shotgun proteomics to survey the serum proteome of 17 vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) from Belize. Using just 2 μL of sample and relatively short separations of undepleted serum digests, we identified 361 proteins across 5 orders of magnitude. Levels of immunological proteins in vampire bat serum were then compared to human plasma via published databases. Of particular interest were antiviral and antibacterial components, circulating 20S proteasome complex and proteins involved in redox activity. Lastly, we used known virus proteomes to putatively identify Rh186 from Macacine herpesvirus 3 and ORF1a from Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, indicating that mass spectrometry-based techniques show promise for pathogen detection. Overall, these results can be used to design targeted mass-spectrometry assays to quantify immunological markers and detect pathogens. More broadly, our findings also highlight the application of proteomics in advancing wildlife immunology and pathogen surveillance.","Neely, Benjamin A; Janech, Michael G; Fenton, M Brock; Simmons, Nancy B; Bland, Alison M; Becker, Daniel J",Journal of proteome research,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00995; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33840197/,513

AIM The aim of this publication is to present early outcomes of minimally invasive surgical management of pleural empyema. Patients were subjected to a single, complex procedure, consisting of the laparoscopic mobilization of the greater omentum and its transposition via the diaphragm into the pleural cavity to fill in the empyema cavity with the consecutive pleuro-cutaneous fistuloplasty (thoracoplasty). MATERIAL AND METHODS Between May 2011 and April 2013, 8 patients were qualified to undergo the procedure. The mean age was 61 years (range: 46-77 years). Presence of bronchopleural fistula was confirmed in 3 cases. The median time of treatment with thoracostomy was 14.5 months. RESULTS The mean operative time was 125 min. The mean duration of post-operative hospital stay was 13.5 days (range: 7-31 days). In 6 patients (75%) the objective of permanent resolution of pleural empyema was achieved. In total, 4 patients had complications: pleural empyema recurrence (2 patients), splenic injury, hiatal hernia, gastrointestinal bleed. Two patients with empyema recurrence had Staphylococcus aureus infections prior to surgery. They were successfully managed both with prolonged thoracic drainage and antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS Use of the greater omentum that was laparoscopically mobilized and transpositioned into the pleural cavity allows simultaneous management of the pleural empyema cavity and thoracostomy. The procedure is safe, with few direct complications. It is well tolerated and has at least a satisfactory cosmetic effect. The minimally invasive approach allows faster recovery and return to daily activities in comparison to the fully open technique.","Żurek, Wojciech; Makarewicz, Wojciech; Bobowicz, Maciej; Sawicka, Wioletta; Rzyman, Witold",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2014.45129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25561992/,513

The recent development of single incision laparoscopic surgery remains a relatively novel technique, and has had mixed reviews as to whether it has been associated with lower pain scores, shorter hospital stays, and higher satisfaction levels among patients undergoing procedures through cosmetically-appeasing single incisions. However, due to technical difficulties that arise from the clustering of laparoscopic instruments through a confined working space, such as loss of instrument triangulation, poor surgical exposure, and instrument clashing, uptake by surgeons without a specific interest and expertise in cutting-edge minimally invasive approaches has been limited. The parallel use of robotic surgery with single-port platforms, however, appears to counteract technical issues associated with single incision laparoscopic surgery through significant ergonomic improvements, including enhanced instrument triangulation, organ retraction, and camera localization within the surgical field. By combining the use of the robot with the single incision platform, the recognized challenges of single incision laparoscopic surgery are simplified, while maintaining potential advantages of the single-incision minimally invasive approach.

Time, temperature, dosage of KOH, and ratio of H2SO4/AC were the predictor variables with 3 levels each, at a significance level of α = .05. A significant yield variation portion of AC was explained by the experimental factors (R2 = .891, F (3, 23) = 62.9, p < .0001), as did the yield of CAT (R2 = .960, F (3, 23) = 185.7, p < .0001), density of SO3H (R2 = .969, F (3, 23) = 242.2, p < .0001), and total acidity (R2 = .973, F (3, 23) = 280.6, p < .0001). Levels of time (p = .001) and KOH dosage (p = .006) were significant to the yield of AC, and temperature levels were not influent on density of SO3H (p = .731) or total acidity (p = .762). CAT showed a SBET of 249 m2 g-1, Vpore of 0.104 cm3 g-1, low crystallinity, high thermal stability, and a mesoporous amorphous structure.

The clinico-radiological data on admission were retrospectively collected and compared between the two groups. The optimal clinico-radiological features were determined based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression analysis, and a predictive nomogram model was established by five-fold cross-validation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were conducted, and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of the nomogram model, quantitative CT parameters that were significant in univariate analysis, and pneumonia severity index (PSI) were compared. Results In comparison with the non-severe group (151 patients), the severe group (45 patients) had a higher PSI (P<0.001). DL-based quantitative CT indicated that the mass of infection (MOICT) and the percentage of infection (POICT) in the whole lung were higher in the severe group (both P<0.001). The nomogram model was based on MOICT and clinical features, including age, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T cell count, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The AUC values of the model, MOICT, POICT, and PSI scores were 0.900, 0.813, 0.805, and 0.751, respectively. The nomogram model performed significantly better than the other three parameters in predicting severity (P=0.003, P=0.001, and P<0.001, respectively). Conclusions Although quantitative CT parameters and the PSI can well predict the severity of COVID-19, the DL-based quantitative CT model is more efficient.","Shi, Weiya; Peng, Xueqing; Liu, Tiefu; Cheng, Zenghui; Lu, Hongzhou; Yang, Shuyi; Zhang, Jiulong; Wang, Mei; Gao, Yaozong; Shi, Yuxin; Zhang, Zhiyong; Shan, Fei",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-2464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33708843/,513

STUDY DESIGN Descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Sakarya University Education and Training Hospital, Sakarya, Turkey, between April 1 and 30, 2020. METHODOLOGY The study included 55 patients who were admitted with diagnosis of COVID-19, and whose illnesses showed a critical course that leads to AKI. The variables were studied as per objective. RESULTS During the follow-up, 43 out of 55 patients (78.2%) died and 12 (21.8%) were discharged with recovery. The mortality was higher in patients at stage 3 (88.9% mortality) compared to stage 2 (53.8% mortality) (p=0.014). In the nonsurvivor group, RDW (red cell distribution width) and albumin levels were lower at admission; whereas, the LDH levels and CRP/albumin ratios were higher. On regression analysis, low albumin level (OR: 12.793, p = 0.010), high LDH level (OR: 8.454, p = 0.026), and presence of stage 3 AKI (OR: 10.268, p = 0.020) were found as independent risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 patients, who developed AKI. CONCLUSION In critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, who developed AKI, it was seen that the presence of low albumin, high LDH, and stage 3 AKI at the time of admission could be used as predictors of mortality. Moreover,, it was shown for the first time that in these patients, the high CRP/albumin ratio and low RDW could be associated with mortality.

147857,The effects of psychological intervention on anxiety symptoms of COVID19-positive patients isolated in hospital wards.,2021-01-01,"INTRODUCTION Portugal took early action to control the COVID-19 epidemic, initiating lockdown measures on March 16th when it recorded only 62 cases of COVID-19 per million inhabitants and reported no deaths. The Portuguese public complied quickly, reducing their overall mobility by 80%. The aim of this study was to estimate the initial impact of the lockdown in Portugal in terms of the reduction of the burden on the healthcare system. MATERIAL AND METHODS We forecasted epidemic curves for: Cases, hospital inpatients (overall and in intensive care), and deaths without lockdown, assuming that the impact of containment measures would start 14 days after initial lockdown was implemented. We used exponential smoothing models for deaths, intensive care and hospitalizations and an ARIMA model for number of cases. Models were selected considering fitness to the observed data up to the 31st March 2020. We then compared observed (with intervention) and forecasted curves (without intervention). RESULTS Between April 1st and April 15th, there were 146 fewer deaths (-25%), 5568 fewer cases (-23%) and, as of April 15th, there were 519 fewer intensive care inpatients (-69%) than forecasted without the lockdown. On April 15th, the number of intensive care inpatients could have reached 748, three times higher than the observed value (229) if the intervention had been delayed. DISCUSSION If the lockdown had not been implemented in mid-March, Portugal intensive care capacity (528 beds) would have likely been breached during the first half of April. The lockdown seems to have been effective in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, serious COVID-19 disease, and associated mortality, thus decreasing demand on health services. CONCLUSION An early lockdown allowed time for the National Health Service to mobilize resources and acquire personal protective equipment, increase testing, contact tracing and hospital and intensive care capacity and to promote broad prevention and control measures. When lifting more stringent measures, strong surveillance and communication strategies that mobilize individual prevention efforts are necessary.","Ricoca Peixoto, Vasco; Vieira, André; Aguiar, Pedro; Carvalho, Carlos; Rhys Thomas, Daniel; Abrantes, Alexandre",Acta medica portuguesa,https://doi.org/10.20344/amp.14129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33160423/,513
148710,Immunomodulatory agents as potential therapeutic or preventive strategies for COVID-19.,2021-06-01,"The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a major multimodal association cortex implicated in a variety of higher order cognitive functions, such as visuospatial perception, spatial attention, categorization, and decision-making. The PPC is known to receive inputs from a collection of sensory cortices as well as various subcortical areas and integrate those inputs to facilitate the execution of functions that require diverse information. Although many recent works have been performed with the mouse as a model system, a comprehensive understanding of long-range connectivity of the mouse PPC is scarce, preventing integrative interpretation of the rapidly accumulating functional data. In this study, we conducted a detailed neuroanatomic and bioinformatic analysis of the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas data to summarize afferent and efferent connections to/from the PPC. Then, we analyzed variability between subregions of the PPC, functional/anatomical modalities, and species, and summarized the organizational principle of the mouse PPC. Finally, we confirmed key results by using additional neurotracers. A comprehensive survey of the connectivity will provide an important future reference to comprehend the function of the PPC and allow effective paths forward to various studies using mice as a model system.","Oh, Seung Wook; Son, Sook Jin; Morris, John A; Choi, Joon Ho; Lee, Changkyu; Rah, Jong-Cheol",Cerebral cortex,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhaa230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901251/,513

Objective To describe the technical and clinical performance of a closed loop system for total intravenous anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil, using the SEDLineTM monitor. Design Multicentric prospective cohort study. Setting Surgery room. Patients ASA I-II undergoing elective surgery. Measurements The authors designed a closed loop system that implements a control algorithm based on anesthetic depth monitoring and the Patient State Index (PSITM) of the SEDLine monitor for propofol, and on hemodynamic variables for remifentanil. The measurement of clinical performance was made based on the percentage of PSITM maintenance time in the range 20-50. Precision analysis was evaluated by measuring median performance error (MDPE) can be defined as the median difference between actual and desired values, which refers to the degree of precision in which the controller is able to maintain the control variable within the objective set by the anesthesiologist; it represents the direction (over-prediction or under-prediction) of performance error (PE) rather than size of errors, which is represented by MDAPE, median absolute percentage error, Wobble index, which is used for measuring the intrasubject variability in performance error. Results Data were obtained from 93 patients in three healthcare centers. The percentage of PSITM maintenance time in the 20-50 range was 92% (80.7-97.0). MDPE was 10.7 (- 11.0-18.0), MDAPE 21.0 (14.2-26.8) and wobble 10.7 (7.0-16.9). No adverse surgical or anesthetic events were found. Conclusions The closed loop total intravenous anesthesia system with SEDLine developed by the authors was used without major complication and appear to be feasible its use in clinical performance.","Castellanos Peñaranda, Claudia; Casas Arroyave, Fabián D; Gómez, Francisco J; Pinzón Corredor, Paola A; Fernández, Juan M; Velez Botero, Marcela; Bohórquez Bedoya, Juan D; Marulanda Toro, Carlos",Perioperative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13741-019-0130-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31921411/,513

Methods The study sample was a group of 199 consecutive patients over 60 (average age 71.41 ± 6.99; 40.2% women) with AF who were hospitalized in order to perform electrical cardioversion. The Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI) was used to assess frailty before cardioversion. The six-month visit after the electrical cardioversion was a follow-up. The follow-up period for the maintenance of sinus rhythm after electrical cardioversion was 180 ± 14 days. Results Patients in whom cardioversion was effective had a statistically significantly lower severity of frailty syndrome (3.44 ± 1.83 vs 5.87 ± 1.12; p=0.000) and its components: physical components (2.14 ± 1.33 vs 3.62 ± 1.05 p=0.000); emotional components (0.92 ± 0.79 vs 1.29 ± 0.86 p=0.037) and social components (0.37 ± 0.56 vs 0.96 ± 0.46; p=0.000) compared to those patients in which cardioversion was ineffective. In the logistic regression, frailty (OR: 0.65, 95% CI:0.5010-0.8330; p=0.000) was observed to be an independent predictor for maintaining sinus rhythm. Conclusion Frailty is a novel, independent factor that can be used to predict the effectiveness of electrical cardioversion and the maintenance of sinus rhythm in the elderly population. Modifying the level of recognition in the Tilburg Frailty Indicator to a 4 improved the prediction of the effectiveness of electrical cardioversion as well as the maintenance of sinus rhythm.","Mlynarska, Agnieszka; Mlynarski, Rafal; Marcisz, Czeslaw; Golba, Krzysztof S",Clinical interventions in aging,https://doi.org/10.2147/cia.s255853; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764905/,513

However, the high variability in cellphone image data acquisition and the common need for large amounts of specialist-annotated images for traditional DL model training may preclude generalizability of smartphone-based diagnostics. Here, we employed adversarial neural networks with conditioning to develop an easily reconfigurable virus diagnostic platform that leverages a dataset of smartphone-taken microfluidic chip photos to rapidly generate image classifiers for different target pathogens on-demand. Adversarial learning was also used to augment this real image dataset by generating 16,000 realistic synthetic microchip images, through style generative adversarial networks (StyleGAN). We used this platform, termed smartphone-based pathogen detection resource multiplier using adversarial networks (SPyDERMAN), to accurately detect different intact viruses in clinical samples and to detect viral nucleic acids through integration with CRISPR diagnostics. We evaluated the performance of the system in detecting five different virus targets using 179 patient samples. The generalizability of the system was confirmed by rapid reconfiguration to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens in nasal swab samples (n = 62) with 100% accuracy. Overall, the SPyDERMAN system may contribute to epidemic preparedness strategies by providing a platform for smartphone-based diagnostics that can be adapted to a given emerging viral agent within days of work.","Shokr, Ahmed; Pacheco, Luis G C; Thirumalaraju, Prudhvi; Kanakasabapathy, Manoj Kumar; Gandhi, Jahnavi; Kartik, Deeksha; Silva, Filipe S R; Erdogmus, Eda; Kandula, Hemanth; Luo, Shenglin; Yu, Xu G; Chung, Raymond T; Li, Jonathan Z; Kuritzkes, Daniel R; Shafiee, Hadi",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c06807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33226787/,513

153581,Our mind-body reactions to COVID-19.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND The objective was to evaluate patterns of pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 testing in a large health system throughout the pandemic, before and after school reopening. METHODS This was a cross-sectional time-series study of clinical virology results from children tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in Southern Connecticut and areas of New York and Rhode Island. Data collected include demographics, hospital admission, changes in percent positive tests over time, detection intervals in persistently positive children and cycle threshold values. The setting was the Yale New Haven Health System has 6 hospitals at 4 Connecticut locations, 1 hospital in Rhode Island and ambulatory locations in Connecticut, Rhode Island and New York. Participants included twenty-three-thousand one-hundred thirty-seven children ≤ 18 years of age, tested for coronavirus disease 2019 at an ambulatory testing site, the emergency department or on an inpatient unit within the Yale New Haven Health System. RESULTS Among all tests, 3.2% were positive. Older children consistently made up the larger portion of positive pediatric cases, regardless of community prevalence. Increased pediatric cases later in the pandemic when prevalence in adults was relatively low correlates with a higher number of tests performed in children and not with an increased positivity rate. No significant changes in trends of positivity were detected after the reopening of schools. Symptomatic and asymptomatic children had similar cycle threshold values regardless of age, and a subset of children demonstrated persistent viral detection, some for as long as 6 weeks. CONCLUSION An increase in pediatric cases documented in the late summer was predominately due to increased access to testing for children. The percent positivity in children did not change in the first 3 weeks after school opened. A subset of children has detectable severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract for weeks after the initial infection.","Peaper, David R; Murdzek, Christina; Oliveira, Carlos R; Murray, Thomas S",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000003024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33399431/,513

In this retrospective case series, a total of 10 female dogs (median age 7 years, range 5.5-10.5 years; median weight 37.0 kg, range 12.9-64.0 kg) with pyometra were included. A multiaccess port was created from a surgical glove attached to an Alexis wound retractor and placed in the ventral midline between the middle and caudal third of the distance between umbilicus and pubic rim. A vessel sealing device was used for transection of the ovarian pedicle. The port size was selected on the basis of maximum uterine diameter determined by ultrasound. Median incision length was 5.0 cm (range 3.1-7.7 cm) for a maximum uterine diameter of 4.0 cm (range 2.0-7.0 cm). Median surgical time was 57 minutes (range 48-65 minutes). No case had to be converted to open celiotomy. Complications included one case of minor, self-limiting splenic trauma by the endoscope. In eight dogs, the distended uterine horns endangered safe access to the ovarian pedicle, and the vessel sealing device was inserted through a second cannula placed periumbilically. Extension of the original incision was necessary to exteriorize organs in two dogs. All dogs recovered quickly and were discharged either on the day of surgery or 1 day thereafter. In conclusion, a surgical glove port technique in combination with an Alexis wound retractor is feasible for surgical laparoscopic treatment of canine pyometra up to a diameter of 7 cm.","Becher-Deichsel, Anja; Aurich, Jörg E; Schrammel, Nadine; Dupré, Gilles",Theriogenology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2016.02.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27039076/,513

In order to elucidate the exact role of Toll-like receptor (TLR) or RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling on immunogenicity and protective efficacy against influenza A virus infection (A/PR/8/34 [PR8]; H1N1), we adapted several innate signal-deficient mice (e.g., TRIF(-/-), MyD88(-/-), MyD88(-/-) TRIF(-/-), TLR3(-/-) TLR7(-/-), and IPS-1(-/-)). In this study, we found that MyD88 signaling was required for recruitment of CD11b(+) granulocytes, production of early inflammatory cytokines, optimal proliferation of CD4 T cells, and production of Th1 cytokines by T cells. However, PR8 virus-specific IgG and IgA antibody levels in both systemic and mucosal compartments were normal in TLR- and RLR-deficient mice. To further assess the susceptibility of these mice to influenza virus infection, protective efficacy was determined after primary or secondary lethal challenge. We found that MyD88(-/-) and MyD88(-/-) TRIF(-/-) mice were more susceptible to primary influenza virus infection than the B6 mice but were fully protected against homologous (H1N1) and heterosubtypic (H5N2) secondary infection when primed with a nonlethal dose of PR8 virus. Taken together, these results show that MyD88 signaling plays an important role for resisting primary influenza virus infection but is dispensable for protection against a secondary lethal challenge.","Seo, Sang-Uk; Kwon, Hyung-Joon; Song, Joo-Hye; Byun, Young-Ho; Seong, Baik Lin; Kawai, Taro; Akira, Shizuo; Kweon, Mi-Na",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01675-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20943980/,513

No direct comparison exists comparing dual antiplatelet therapy regimens-namely, Ticagrelor and Aspirin versus Clopidogrel and Aspirin. This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) will examine the efficacy of these two different antiplatelet regimens in preventing recurrent stroke and mortality up to 30 days. METHODS AND ANALYSIS MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) will be searched with the assistance of a medical information specialist. Two independent reviewers will screen studies for inclusion; eligible studies will include randomized controlled trials that enrolled adults presenting with acute minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and compared one or more of the interventions against each other and/or a control. The primary outcomes will be recurrent ischemic stroke up to 30 days from symptom onset. Secondary outcomes will include safety outcomes (I.e. major bleeding and mortality), functional disability, and outcomes up to 90 days from symptom onset. A Bayesian approach to NMA will be implemented using the BUGSnet function in R Software. Between group comparisons for time-to-event (TTE) and dichotomous outcomes will be presented in terms of hazard ratios and odds ratios with 95% credible intervals, respectively. Secondary effect measures of treatment ranking will also be estimated. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No formal research ethics approval are necessary. We will disseminate our findings through scientific conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and social media/the press.

Substantial investment has been made to develop biomarkers for cancer detection, but few have reached routine clinical practice. We aimed to identify novel biomarkers for upper GI cancers which have been sufficiently validated to be ready for evaluation in low-prevalence populations. METHODS We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, and Web of Science for studies published in English from January 2000 to October 2019 (PROSPERO registration CRD42020165005). Reference lists of included studies were assessed. Studies had to report on second measures of diagnostic performance (beyond discovery phase) for biomarkers (single or in panels) used to detect pancreatic, oesophageal, gastric, and biliary tract cancers. We included all designs and excluded studies with less than 50 cases/controls. Data were extracted on types of biomarkers, populations and outcomes. Heterogeneity prevented pooling of outcomes. RESULTS We identified 149 eligible studies, involving 22,264 cancer cases and 49,474 controls. A total of 431 biomarkers were identified (183 microRNAs and other RNAs, 79 autoantibodies and other immunological markers, 119 other proteins, 36 metabolic markers, 6 circulating tumour DNA and 8 other). Over half (n = 231) were reported in pancreatic cancer studies. Only 35 biomarkers had been investigated in at least two studies, with reported outcomes for that individual marker for the same tumour type. Apolipoproteins (apoAII-AT and apoAII-ATQ), and pepsinogens (PGI and PGII) were the most promising biomarkers for pancreatic and gastric cancer, respectively. CONCLUSION Most novel biomarkers for the early detection of upper GI cancers are still at an early stage of matureness. Further evidence is needed on biomarker performance in low-prevalence populations, in addition to implementation and health economic studies, before extensive adoption into clinical practice can be recommended.","Calanzani, Natalia; Druce, Paige E; Snudden, Claudia; Milley, Kristi M; Boscott, Rachel; Behiyat, Dawnya; Saji, Smiji; Martinez-Gutierrez, Javiera; Oberoi, Jasmeen; Funston, Garth; Messenger, Mike; Emery, Jon; Walter, Fiona M",Advances in therapy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-020-01571-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33306189/,513

Newer integrated monitoring, with sophisticated hardware and software, has the potential to minimise artefacts. However, monitoring issues continue to occur, with the potential for critical incidents and unnecessary and harmful interventions. We describe the root cause analysis of a series of apparent ECG flatline asystolic events that appeared in the operating room shortly after the introduction of new intra-operative monitoring systems. Clinical events and biomedical laboratory testing revealed complete loss of ECG signal with increasing resistance. The new ECG systems had incorporated both software and hardware changes to improve the fidelity of signal acquisition and display, but had become much more sensitive to impedance changes. After we alerted the manufacturer, they added software and hardware updates that resulted in resolution of all incidents of ECG loss-of-signal.","Cowie, B; Baker, L; Shoghi, B; Worner, M; Scott, D",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.14250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29520908/,513

Blood parameters, such as lymphocytes, C reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, or D-dimer, are associated with severity and prognosis of SARS CoV-2 patients. This study aims to identify blood-related predictors of severe hospitalization in patients diagnosed with SARS CoV-2. METHODS: Observational retrospective study of all rt-PCR and blood-test positive (at 48 hours of hospitalization) SARS CoV-2 diagnosed inpatients between March-May 2020. Deceased and/or ICU inpatients were considered as severe cases, whereas those patients after hospital discharge were considered as non-severe. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of severity, based on bivariate contrast between severe and mild inpatients. RESULTS: The overall sample comprised 540 patients, with 374 mild cases (69.26%), and 166 severe cases (30.75%). The multivariate logistic regression model for predicting SARS CoV-2 severity included lymphocytes, C reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, total protein levels, glucose and aspartate aminotransferase as predictors, showing an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.895 at a threshold of 0.29, with 81.5% of sensitivity and 81% of specificity. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that our predictive model allows identifying and stratifying SARS CoV-2 patients in risk of developing severe medical complications based on blood-test parameters easily measured at hospital admission, improving health-care resources management and distribution.","Gómez, Laura Criado; Curto, Santiago Villanueva; Sebastian, Maria Belén Pérez; Jiménez, Begoña Fernández; Duniol, Melisa Duque",EJIFCC,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8343039/,513
190003,"Synthesis, antiviral and cytotoxic investigation of 2-phenyl-3-substituted quinazolin-4(3H)-ones.",2011,"Lewis and Brown Norway (BN) rats which are susceptible or resistant to autoimmune reactions against brain antigen, respectively, were inoculated intracerebrally with a neurotropic measles virus. Suckling rats died from a rapidly fatal acute encephalopathy (AE). With increasing age Lewis rats developed a subacute measles encephalomyelitis (SAME) whereas BN rats showed a clinically silent encephalitis (CSE). Infectious virus could occasionally be recovered from SAME animals using cocultivation techniques but not from BN rats with CSE. With monoclonal antibodies against measles virus, viral proteins were localized in brain tissue. Nucleocapsid and phosphoprotein were detected in infected brain cells of all animals with AE, SAME and CSE, whereas measles virus haemagglutinin, fusion and matrix proteins were either reduced or absent, suggesting a restricted synthesis of measles virus envelope proteins. These data suggest that the different diseases of the two rat strains are related to the immunogenetic background rather than to the replication of measles virus in the central nervous system. This animal model provides the opportunity to investigate further the events occurring during establishment of measles virus persistence in the brain, and the genetic control of associated immunological and immunopathological reactions.","Liebert, U G; ter Meulen, V",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3495633/,513

OBJECTIVES To analyze sub-populations of lymphocytes at hospital admission in survivors and deceased from severe pneumonia due to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study of healthcare workers confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 in convalescents (control group) and healthy controls (HC) diagnosed with severe COVID-19. Serum samples were taken at hospital admission and after recovery. Serum samples ≥ 25 days after onset of symptoms were analyzed for lymphocyte subpopulations through flow cytometry. Descriptive statistics, Kruskall-Wallis test, receiver operating characteristic curve, calculation of sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and Kaplan-Meier analysis were performed. RESULTS We included 337 patients: 120 HC, 127 convalescents, and 90 severe COVID-19 disease patients (50 survivors, 40 deceased). For T cells, total lymphocytes ≥ 800/μL, CD3+ ≥ 400/μL, CD4+ ≥ 180/μL, CD8+ ≥ 150/μL, B cells CD19+ ≥ 80/μL, and NK ≥ 34/μL subsets were associated with survival in severe COVID-19 disease patients. All subtypes of lymphocytes had higher concentrations in survivors than deceased, but similar between HC and convalescents. Leukocytes ≥ 10.150/μL or neutrophils ≥ 10,000/μL were associated with increased mortality. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) ≥ 8.5 increased the probability of death in severe COVID-19 (odds ratio 11.68). CONCLUSIONS Total lymphocytes; NLR; and levels of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and NK cells are useful as biomarkers of survival or mortality in severe COVID-19 disease and commonly reach normal levels in convalescents.","Montiel-Cervantes, Laura A; Medina, Gabriela; Pilar Cruz-Domínguez, Maria; Pérez-Tapia, Sonia-Mayra; Jiménez-Martínez, Maria C; Arrieta-Oliva, Hugo-Iván; Carballo-Uicab, Gregorio; López-Pelcastre, Laura; Camacho-Sandoval, Rosa",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33734627/,513

By developing an understanding of the skills students perceive to be necessary for their careers following the COVID-19 pandemic, comparisons can be drawn with industry perspectives to determine whether these perspectives align and, more importantly, support students’ successful development of skills as sought by the industry. An online survey of current undergraduate tertiary aviation students at Australian universities was conducted to determine the perceived impediments, additional skills required, post-graduation plans and how university courses should evolve post-COVID-19. The results show that students are cognisant of the current oversupply of aviation professionals due to the downturn in the industry and are seeking further support with the development of non-technical skills to better prepare themselves to be competitive following graduation. These findings have implications for both undergraduate aviation students and universities offering an undergraduate aviation program. By considering these findings universities can adapt their programs to better prepare students and support the development of skilled aviation professionals, equipped to deal with challenges of the post-COVID-19 aviation industry.","Miani, Peter Kille Tarryn Lee Seung-Yong Zhang Yahua Bates Paul Raymond",Journal of Air Transport Management,,513
215123,Early combination treatment with existing HIV antivirals: an effective treatment for COVID-19?,2021,"Pharmaceuticals enhance our quality of life; consequently, their consumption is growing as a result of the need to treat ageing-related and chronic diseases and changes in the clinical practice. The market revenues also show an historic growth worldwide motivated by the increase on the drug demand. However, this positivism on the market is fogged because the discharge of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites into the environment, including water, also increases due to their inappropriate management, treatment and disposal; now, worldwide, this fact is recognized as an environmental concern and human health risk. Intriguingly, researchers have studied the most effective methods for pharmaceutical removal in wastewater; however, the types of pharmaceuticals investigated in most of these studies do not reflect the most produced and consumed pharmaceuticals on the market. Hence, an attempt was done to analyze the pharmaceutical market, drugs consumption trends and the pharmaceutical research interests worldwide. Notwithstanding, the intensive research work done in different pharmaceutical research fronts such as disposal and fate, environmental impacts and concerns, human health risks, removal, degradation and development of treatment technologies, found that such research is not totally aligned with the market trends and consumption patterns. There are other drivers and interests that promote the pharmaceutical research. Thus, this review is an important contribution to those that are interested not only on the pharmaceutical market and drugs consumption, but also on the links, the drivers and interests that motivate and determine the research work on certain groups of pharmaceuticals on water and wastewater.","González Peña, Omar Israel; López Zavala, Miguel Ángel; Cabral Ruelas, Héctor",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,513
221352,Therapy for Argentine hemorrhagic fever in nonhuman primates with a humanized monoclonal antibody,2021,"[Background] A pulmonary artery to ascending aorta ratio (PA:Ao) is helpful for detecting pulmonary hypertension. Few studies have revealed the characteristics of PA:Ao in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of the present study is to clarify the significance of the PA:Ao in patients with COVID-19. [Material and Methods]We retrospectively analyzed 373 patients who had an outpatient visit or admission to our hospital and underwent chest CT from February to October 2020. The patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of lung lesions. The diameter of the PA was measured at the subjective bifurcation. The diameter of the Ao was measured at the same CT slice, then PA/Ao ratio was calculated. These imaging analyses were performed by two pulmologists.[Results]The number of COVID-19 group (hereafter group C) and non COVID-19 group (hereafter group non-C) were 274 and 99. Mean age of group C/group non-C = 49.1 ± 19.4/58.0 ± 20.9 years. Male: female in group C/group non-C = 179:95/68:31. Lung lesions on CT in group C : presence/absence = 220/54;non-C group: presence/absence = 34/65 patients. The mean PA diameter/A diameter was 27.5±4.1 mm /30.6±5.2 mm in group C and 26.2±4.6 mm /34.1±5.2 mm in group non-C. The mean PA/Ao ratio of group C and group non-C were 0.91 vs. 0.79. The PA/Ao ratio was significantly increased in group C(p&lt;0.05). Regarding the group without lung lesions on CT, the mean PA/A diameter was 27.6±4.1 mm/30.6±5.2 mm in group C and 25.9±4.3 mm/34.1±5.3 mm in group non-C. The mean PA/Ao ratio of group C and group non-C were 0.93 vs 0.78(p&lt;0.05). The PA/Ao ratio is significantly increased in the group C(p&lt;0.05). This indicates that the PA/A ratio is elevated in COVID-19 patients with or without lung lesions on CT. [Conclusion]An elevation in PA/Ao ration in COVID-19 were found with or without lung lesions on CT.This may suggest the presence of potential pulmonary hypertension in COVID-19 patients.","Nishimura, M.; Ohta, S.; Hirouchi, T.; Shinada, K.; Morikawa, M.; Shinoda, M.; Shinkai, M.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,513

248206,Predicting an epidemic trajectory is difficult,2020,"BACKGROUND: When initiating the Danish vaccination program against COVID-19, the incidence of anaphylaxis was estimated to be 10 times higher compared to other virus-based vaccines. In this study, we present data on patients referred with suspected allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines. The main purpose of the study is to investigate the incidence and severity of the allergic reactions, and to evaluate the safety of revaccination. METHODS: All patients in the region of Southern Denmark with case histories of allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines in a defined period are included in this study. Diagnostic work up consisted of a detailed case history, evaluation of Brighton level of diagnostic certainty and World Allergy Organization grade of anaphylaxis and skin prick testing- and basophil histamine release testing with COVID-19 vaccines and relevant drug excipients. Patients were revaccinated at the Allergy Center when possible. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients are included in this study. In 199,377 doses administered, nine patients fulfilled the criteria of anaphylaxis when using the Brighton Criteria (incidence being 45 per million). Of 55 patients with reactions to the first dose, 52 patients were revaccinated without adverse reactions. We found no proven cases of immediate anaphylaxis due to COVID-19 vaccines. By skin prick test, we diagnosed three patients with drug excipient allergy and further a patient with mastocytosis was found. CONCLUSIONS: Anaphylactic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines are rare and the incidence is similar to what is seen with other virus-based vaccines. Revaccination is safe in the majority of patients; however, allergological evaluation is important since some prove to have drug excipient allergy.","Rasmussen, Trine Holm; Mortz, Charlotte Gotthard; Georgsen, Torbjorn Kabel; Rasmussen, Helene Marlies; Kjaer, Henrik Fomsgaard; Bindslev-Jensen, Carsten",Clin Transl Allergy,,513

While the COVID-19 pandemic has been increasingly affecting the world, the occurrence of disasters resulted in complex emergencies. The present review is aimed to identify the literature focused on health system response to coincidence of COVID-19 and disasters as well as describing their finding, implications and lessons-learned. METHODS: This study was conducted and reported based on PRISMA guideline. The databases of Web of Sciences, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and World Health Organization Library were searched. The inclusion criteria were all forms of published articles which investigated the coincidence of disasters and COVID-19 pandemic. Using the title and abstract screening, the selections of studies were performed by two researchers. Once, the relevant papers were finalized, the analysis was done in two parts of descriptive analysis and implications for health systems. RESULTS: Out of 1245 studies generated by initial search, a number of 13 articles was selected for final analysis. Earthquake was the most frequent disaster which its coincidence with COVID-19 was studied by researchers (31%). The implications of researchers for healthcare system were explained in three sections of climatic events, earthquakes and all hazard approach in relation to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Extracting the lessons learned from the regions affected by disasters at the time of COVID-19 pandemic can be helpful for healthcare professionals and policy-makers to improve their preparedness and response during disasters and a serious pandemic such as COVID-19. Further research is needed to identify the factors which strengthen the preparedness of health system for the dual risk of natural hazards and pandemics.","Sohrabizadeh, Sanaz; Yousefian, Shiva; Bahramzadeh, Amirhosein; Vaziri, Mohammad Hossein",BMC Public Health,,513

We investigated the influence of personal protective equipment on out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. METHODS: Randomised controlled non-inferiority triple-crossover study. Forty-eight emergency medical service providers, randomized into teams of two, performed 12â¯min of basic life support (BLS) on a manikin after climbing 3 flights of stairs. Three scenarios were completed in a randomised order: Without personal protective equipment, with personal protective equipment including a filtering face piece (FFP) 2 mask with valve, and with personal protective equipment including an FFP2 mask without valve. The primary outcome was mean depth of chest compressions with a pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 3.5â¯mm. Secondary outcomes included other measurements of CPR quality, providers' subjective exhaustion levels, and providers' vital signs, including end-tidal CO2. RESULTS: Differences regarding the primary outcome were well below the pre-defined non-inferiority margins for both control vs. personal protective equipment without valve (absolute difference 1â¯mm, 95% CI [-1, 2]) and control vs. personal protective equipment with valve (absolute difference 1â¯mm, [-0.2, 2]). This was also true for secondary outcomes regarding quality of chest compressions and providers' vital signs including etCO2. Subjective physical strain after BLS was higher in the personal protective equipment groups (Borg 4 (SD 3) without valve, 4 (SD 2) with valve) than in the control group (Borg 3 (SD 2)).

The temporal expression and distribution of cell-specific and tissue-specific mtDNA heteroplasmy in healthy individuals may be functionally associated with intracellular mitochondrial signaling pathways and nuclear DNA gene expression. The maintenance of endogenously regulated tissue-specific copy numbers of heteroplasmic mtDNA may represent a sensitive biomarker of homeostasis of mitochondrial dynamics, metabolic integrity, and immune competence. Myeloid cells, monocytes, macrophages, and antigen-presenting dendritic cells undergo programmed changes in mitochondrial metabolism according to innate and adaptive immunological processes. In the central nervous system (CNS), the polarization of activated microglial cells is dependent on strategically programmed changes in mitochondrial function. Therefore, variations in heteroplasmic mtDNA copy numbers may have functional consequences in metabolically competent mitochondria in innate and adaptive immune processes involving the CNS. Recently, altered mitochondrial function has been demonstrated in the progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Accordingly, our review is organized to present convergent lines of empirical evidence that potentially link expression of mtDNA heteroplasmy by functionally interactive CNS cell types to the extent and severity of acute and chronic post-COVID-19 neurological disorders.","Stefano, George B; Kream, Richard M",Cell. mol. neurobiol,,513

427099,Ranking the risk of animal-to-human spillover for newly discovered viruses,2021,"Extreme Learning Machine is a powerful classification method very competitive existing classification methods. It is extremely fast at training. Nevertheless, it cannot perform face verification tasks properly because face verification tasks require comparison of facial images of two individuals at the same time and decide whether the two faces identify the same person. The structure of Extreme Leaning Machine was not designed to feed two input data streams simultaneously, thus, in 2-input scenarios Extreme Learning Machine methods are normally applied using concatenated inputs. However, this setup consumes two times more computational resources and it is not optimized for recognition tasks where learning a separable distance metric is critical. For these reasons, we propose and develop a Siamese Extreme Learning Machine (SELM). SELM was designed to be fed with two data streams in parallel simultaneously. It utilizes a dual-stream Siamese condition in the extra Siamese layer to transform the data before passing it along to the hidden layer. Moreover, we propose a Gender-Ethnicity-Dependent triplet feature exclusively trained on a variety of specific demographic groups. This feature enables learning and extracting of useful facial features of each group. Experiments were conducted to evaluate and compare the performances of SELM, Extreme Learning Machine, and DCNN. The experimental results showed that the proposed feature was able to perform correct classification at 97.87% accuracy and 99.45% AUC. They also showed that using SELM in conjunction with the proposed feature provided 98.31% accuracy and 99.72% AUC. They outperformed the well-known DCNN and Extreme Leaning Machine methods by a wide margin.","Kudisthalert, Wasu; Pasupa, Kitsuchart; Morales, Aythami; Fierrez, Julian",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03140v1.pdf,513

496622,In silico screening of natural compounds against COVID-19 by targeting Mpro and ACE2 using molecular docking,2020,"BACKGROUND: The mortality rate from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is high among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hence, risk evaluation tools are required to immediately identify high-risk patients upon admission for early intervention. METHODS: A cohort of 220 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. To analyze the risk factors of ARDS, data obtained from approximately 70% of the participants were randomly selected and used as training dataset to establish a logistic regression model. Meanwhile, data obtained from the remaining 30% of the participants were used as test dataset to validate the effect of the model. RESULTS: Lactate dehydrogenase, blood urea nitrogen, D-dimer, procalcitonin, and ferritin levels were included in the risk score system and were assigned a score of 25, 15, 34, 20, and 24, respectively. The cutoff value for the total score was > 35, with a sensitivity of 100.00% and specificity of 81.20%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test were 0.967 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.925-0.989) and 0.437(P Value = 0.437). The model had excellent discrimination and calibration during internal validation. CONCLUSIONS: The novel risk score may be a valuable risk evaluation tool for screening patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk of ARDS.","Liang, Mengyuan; He, Miao; Tang, Jian; He, Xinliang; Liu, Zhijun; Feng, Siwei; Chen, Ping; Li, Hui; Xue, Yu039; Bai, Tao; Ma, Yanling; Zhang, Jianchu",BMC Infect Dis,,513

Anxiety about COVID-19 is more than simply worry about infection. Research provides evidence of a COVID Stress Syndrome characterized by (1) worry about the dangers of COVID-19 and worry about coming into contact with coronavirus contaminated objects or surfaces, (2) worry about the personal socioeconomic impact of COVID-19, (3) xenophobic worries that foreigners are spreading COVID-19, (4) COVID-19-related traumatic stress symptoms (e.g., nightmares), and (5) COVID-19-related compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking. These form a network of interrelated nodes. Research also provides evidence of another constellation or “syndrome”, characterized by (1) belief that one has robust physical health against COVID-19, (2) belief that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated, and (3) disregard for social distancing. These also form a network of nodes known as a COVID-19 Disregard Syndrome. The present study, based on a population-representative sample of 3075 American and Canadian adults, sought to investigate how these syndromes are related to substance use and abuse. We found substantial COVID-19-related increases in alcohol and drug use. Network analyses indicated that although the two syndromes are negatively correlated with one another, they both have positive links to alcohol and drug abuse. More specifically, COVID-19-related traumatic stress symptoms and the tendency to disregard social distancing were both linked to substance abuse.

Building upon the scholarship on transnational migration and transnational social protection, we argue that understanding how immigrants manage moments of crisis requires a cross-border optic. As we show, transnational connections can be translated into valuable material and immaterial resources. However, such protections are contingent upon the reception of their local receiving communities. The perceived hierarchy between the sending and receiving society, coupled with the U.S.' lack of experience with infectious disease outbreaks, limits the extent to which immigrants could put their transnational knowledge and resources to use. Our analyses shed new light upon the circumstances that empower and constrain immigrants as the global pandemic unsettles their daily routines.","Cao, Xuemei; Sun, Ken Chih-Yan",Soc Sci Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34530216/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953621007103; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953621007103,513

For that purpose, an online questionnaire, based on 44 items including socio-demographic data, Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) Adherence Screener (MEDAS) as a reference of a healthy diet, processed foods intake, changes in their usual food choices and weight gain was distributed using social media and snowball sampling. A total of 7514 participants (37% aged below 35 years, 70.6% female, 77.9% university-level education or higher) from all the Spanish territory completed the questionnaire. Results outlined healthier dietary behaviours during the confinement when compared to previous habits. Overall, the MEDAS score (ranging from 0 to 14, whereby higher a scoring reflects greater adherence to the MedDiet) increased significantly from 6.53 ± 2 to 7.34 ± 1.93 during the confinement. Multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for age, gender, region and other variables, showed a statistically significant higher likelihood of changing the adherence to the MedDiet (towards an increase in adherence) in those persons who decreased the intake of fried foods, snacks, fast foods, red meat, pastries or sweet beverages, but increased MedDiet-related foods such as olive oil, vegetables, fruits or legumes during the confinement. COVID-19 confinement in Spain has led to the adoption of healthier dietary habits/behaviours in the studied population, as reflected by a higher adherence to the MedDiet. This improvement, if sustained in the long-term, could have a positive impact on the prevention of chronic diseases and COVID-19-related complications.","Rodríguez-Pérez, Celia; Molina-Montes, Esther; Verardo, Vito; Artacho, Reyes; García-Villanova, Belén; Guerra-Hernández, Eduardo Jesús; Ruíz-López, María Dolores",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12061730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32531892/,513

Cardiac arrhythmias are more common in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The potential mechanisms that could result in arrhythmogenesis among COVID-19 patients includes hypoxia caused by direct viral tissue involvement of lungs, myocarditis, abnormal host immune response, myocardial ischemia, myocardial strain, electrolyte derangements, intravascular volume imbalances and drug sides effects. To manage these arrhythmias, it is imperative to increase the awareness of potential drug-drug interactions, to monitor QTc prolongation while receiving COVID therapy and provide special considerations for patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes. It is also crucial to minimize exposure to COVID-19 infection by stratifying the need for intervention and using telemedicine. As COVID-19 infection continues to prevail with a potential for future surges, more data is required to better understand pathophysiology and to validate management strategies.","Dherange, Parinita; Lang, Joshua; Qian, Pierre; Oberfeld, Blake; Sauer, William H.; Koplan, Bruce; Tedrow, Usha",JACC Clin Electrophysiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405500X20306952; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405500X20306952?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32972561/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacep.2020.08.002,513

649484,"Bioefficacy of Lemongrass and Tea Tree Essential Oils Against House Fly, Musca domestica",2021-02-18,"Background: In many parts of the world, livestock production is undergoing a process of rapid intensification. The health implications of this development are uncertain. Intensification creates cheaper products, allowing more people to access animal-based foods. However, some practices associated with intensification may contribute to zoonotic disease emergence and spread: for example, the sustained use of antibiotics, concentration of animals in confined units, and long distances and frequent movement of livestock. Objectives: Here we present the diverse range of ecological, biological, and socioeconomic factors likely to enhance or reduce zoonotic risk, and identify ways in which a comprehensive risk analysis may be conducted by using an interdisciplinary approach. We also offer a conceptual framework to guide systematic research on this problem. Discussion: We recommend that interdisciplinary work on zoonotic risk should take into account the complexity of risk environments, rather than limiting studies to simple linear causal relations between risk drivers and disease emergence and/or spread. In addition, interdisciplinary integration is needed at different levels of analysis, from the study of risk environments to the identification of policy options for risk management. Conclusion: Given rapid changes in livestock production systems and their potential health implications at the local and global level, the problem we analyze here is of great importance for environmental health and development. Although we offer a systematic interdisciplinary approach to understand and address these implications, we recognize that further research is needed to clarify methodological and practical questions arising from the integration of the natural and social sciences.","Liverani, Marco; Waage, Jeff; Barnett, Tony; Pfeiffer, Dirk U.; Rushton, Jonathan; Rudge, James W.; Loevinsohn, Michael E.; Scoones, Ian; Smith, Richard D.; Cooper, Ben S.; White, Lisa J.; Goh, Shan; Horby, Peter; Wren, Brendan; Gundogdu, Ozan; Woods, Abigail; Coker, Richard J.",Environ Health Perspect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23665854/; https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1206001,513
649658,Rapid and Real-time Detection of Human Viral Infections: Current Trends and Future Perspectives,2012-01-18,"This paper investigates the impact of corporate governance and culture background on firms’ environmental performance and CSR disclosure from a global perspective. It also provides evidence of a positive relationship between performance and CSR disclosure, supporting the voluntary disclosure theory. We find that common internal corporate governance best practices (such as CEO non-duality, board with ESG committee and gender diversified board) are associated with better environmental performance and more disclosure of CSR related information. Debt is an effective internal governance vehicle and positively affects firms’ environmental performance and CSR disclosure. Cross-listed firms perform better environmentally and disclose more CSR information. Firms residing in countries with stronger legal systems have less voluntary CSR disclosure, implying that external governance is functional and may partially serve as a substitute for internal governance. In terms of culture influence, we find that firms in countries with low power distance, individualism, femininity, high uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation perform better environmentally. Firms in low power distance, collectivistic, feminine, long-term oriented, high uncertainty avoidance and restrained countries disclose more CSR information.","Lu, Jing; Wang, Jun",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1042443120301487; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1042443120301487?v=s5,513

This paper provides an urgent appeal to the medical community to include the issue of religious or spiritual interventions for the living and the dead. However, a question is raised: what kind and form of spiritual or religious interventions can the religious leaders come up with? The most immediate need is to provide care for those infected by the COVID-19, providing assistance in their healing process and giving spiritual support to the bereaved family members.","Corpuz, Jeff Clyde G",J Public Health (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32930714/; https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa167,513
665053,The first step in the success or failure of emerging pathogens,2020-11-24,"The soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins are small and abundant membrane-bound proteins, whose specific interactions mediate membrane fusion during cell fusion or cellular trafficking. In this study, we report the use of a label-free method, called imaging ellipsometer to analyze the interactions among three SNAREs, namely Sec22p, Ykt6p and Sso2p. The SNAREs were immobilized on the silicon wafer and then analyzed in a pairwise mode with microfluidic array, leading us to discover the interactions between Ykt6p and Sso2p, Sec22p and Sso2p. Moreover, by using the real-time function of the imaging ellipsometer, we were able to obtain their association constants (K(A)) of about 10(4) M(−1). We argue that the use of imaging ellipsometer coupled with microfluidic device will deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying membrane fusion process.","Qi, Cai; Zhang, Hong; Liu, Li; Yang, Yinke; Kang, Tengfei; Hao, Wenxin; Jin, Gang; Jiang, Taijiao",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24938428/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep05341,513

Regarding prevalence, indeed, growing literature yields a variable frequency of loss of smell (LOS) in Covid‐19 patients, that may be hypothetically due to differences in the location and amount of viral load, to the different immune response between younger mild‐symptomatic outpatients (higher prevalence) and more severely affected inpatients (lower prevalence)(1,2), and to the variable methods of measurement.","Beltrán‐Corbellini, Álvaro; Chico‐García, Juan Luís; Martínez‐Poles, Javier; Rodríguez‐Jorge, Fernando; Alonso‐Cánovas, Araceli",Eur J Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32449247/,513
671257,Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever: Current Scenario in India,2013-06-26,"BACKGROUND: Pandemics of infectious diseases have long been regarded as societal challenges. This study aimed to summarize the theories of Persian medicine for controlling respiratory disease-related pandemics and to compare these theories with the findings of modern medicine. METHODS: We searched the classic medical reference books of the 9th to 19th centuries for the terms ‘polluted air’ and ‘pandemic’, and we searched 4 databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Scopus) with the keywords ‘COVID-19’, ‘pandemic’, ‘history’, and ‘prevention programs’. The results were collected and subjected to content analysis. RESULTS: From the point of view of traditional Iranian physicians, disease prevention is primarily possible by avoiding pathogenic factors. As a secondary solution, reducing one's susceptibility to the disease is crucial; this can be achieved through cleansing the body and strengthening the mood, reducing food intake, decreasing the internal humidity, disinfecting the house with herbal fumigation, and making use of pleasant aromas. Some of these recommendations are reaffirmed by modern research. CONCLUSION: Persian medicine techniques may be preventive during respiratory, influenza-like disease pandemics. However, rigorous studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.","Iranzadasl, Maryam; Karimi, Yasin; Moadeli, Fatemeh; Pasalar, Mehdi",Integr Med Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imr.2020.100483; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213422020301153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32802742/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213422020301153?v=s5,513
