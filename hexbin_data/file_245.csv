905,"Predictors and outcome of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by miliary tuberculosis: a retrospective study in Chongqing, China",2012-05-20,"BACKGROUND: Miliary tuberculosis (TB) is an uncommon cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a high mortality. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics, predictors and outcome of patients with ARDS caused by miliary TB. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted among patients with a diagnosis of ARDS with miliary TB in four hospitals from 2006 to 2010. Medical records and laboratory examinations of these patients were taken during the first 24 h of admission. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients with miliary TB developed ARDS, 45 of whom survived (52.9%). The median age was 36.6 ± 12.5 years with 38 males (44.7%). Diabetes mellitus (DM) was the most common underlying disease (18.8%).ICU mortality was 47.1%. The time from admission to anti-tuberculosis therapy was 4.5 ± 2.0 days. Mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 8.5 ± 3.0 days in all patients. Duration of time to diagnosis, time from diagnosis to mechanical ventilation, and time to anti-tuberculosis therapy were significantly shorter in survivors than those in non-survivors. Diabetes mellitus (OR 5.431, 95%CI 1.471-20.049; P = 0.005), ALT (70-100U/L, OR 10.029, 95%CI 2.764-36.389; P = 0.001), AST (>94U/L,OR 8.034, 95%CI 2.200-29.341; P = 0.002), D-dimer (>1.6mg/L, OR 3.167, 95%CI 0.896-11.187; P = 0.042), hemoglobin (<90g/L, OR 14.824, 95%CI 3.713-59.179; P = 0.001), albumin (<25g/L, OR 15.896, 95%CI 3.975-63.566; P = 0.001) were independent predictors of ARDS development in the setting of miliary TB. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate diagnosis, early initiation of anti-tuberculosis therapy and mechanical ventilation are important for the outcome of patients with ARDS caused by miliary TB. DM, ALT, AST, D-dimer, hemoglobin, and albumin are independent predictors of ARDS development in patients with miliary TB.","Deng, Wang; Yu, Min; Ma, Hilary; Hu, Liang An; Chen, Gang; Wang, Yong; Deng, Jia; Li, ChangYi; Tong, Jin; Wang, Dao Xin",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3407496/,245
6027,"Thrombozytentransfusion: Klinik, Kontrollen und Komplikationen",1991,"It is assumed that a timely mass administration of antiviral drugs, backed by quarantines and social distancing, could contain a nascent influenza epidemic at its source, provided that the first clusters of cases were localized within a short time. However, effective routine surveillance may be impossible in countries lacking basic public health resources. For a global containment strategy to be successful, low-cost, easy-to-use handheld units that permit decentralized testing would be vital. Here we present a microfluidic platform that can detect the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 in a throat swab sample by using magnetic forces to manipulate a free droplet containing superparamagnetic particles. In a sequential process, the viral RNA is isolated, purified, preconcentrated by 50,000% and subjected to ultrafast real-time RT-PCR. Compared to commercially available tests, the bioassay is equally sensitive and is 440% faster and 2,000–5,000% cheaper.

11875,Pediatric Coronavirus Disease-2019–Associated Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome,2020-05-22,"OBJECTIVE: To perform antiviral susceptibility monitoring of treated individuals in the community during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in England. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 200 and 400 patients were enrolled daily through the National Pandemic Flu Service (NPFS) and issued with a self-sampling kit. Initially, only persons aged 16 and over were eligible, but from 12 November (week 45), self-sampling was extended to include school-age children (5 years and older). All samples received were screened for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 as well as seasonal influenza [A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and influenza B] by a combination of RT–PCR and virus isolation methods. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 RT–PCR-positive samples were screened for the oseltamivir resistance-inducing H275Y substitution, and a subset of samples also underwent phenotypic antiviral susceptibility testing by enzyme inhibition assay. RESULTS: We were able to detect virus by RT–PCR in self-taken samples and recovered infectious virus enabling further virological characterization. The majority of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 RT–PCR-positive NPFS samples (n = 1273) were taken after oseltamivir treatment had begun. No reduction in phenotypic susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors was detected, but five cases with minority quasi-species of oseltamivir-resistant virus (an H275Y amino acid substitution in neuraminidase) were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Self-sampling is a useful tool for community surveillance, particularly for the follow-up of drug-treated patients. The virological study of self-taken samples from the NPFS provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the emergence of oseltamivir resistance in treated individuals with mild illness in the community, a target population that may not be captured by traditional sentinel surveillance schemes.","Lackenby, Angie; Elliot, Alex J.; Powers, Cassandra; Andrews, Nick; Ellis, Joanna; Bermingham, Alison; Thompson, Catherine; Galiano, Monica; Large, Shirley; Durnall, Hayley; Fleming, Douglas; Smith, Gillian; Zambon, Maria",J Antimicrob Chemother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7313964/,245
14914,Post-Streptococcus mitis infection polyserositis,2021-01-20,"OBJECTIVE: The first observational study to investigate the impact of early supported discharge (ESD) on length of hospital stay in real-world conditions. DESIGN: Using historical prospective Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) data (1 January 2013–31 December 2016) and multilevel modelling, cross-sectional (2015–2016; 30 791 patients nested within 55 hospitals) and repeated cross-sectional (2013–2014 vs 2015–2016; 49 266 patients nested within 41 hospitals) analyses were undertaken. SETTING: Hospitals were sampled across a large geographical area of England covering the West and East Midlands, the East of England and the North of England. PARTICIPANTS: Stroke patients whose data were entered into the SSNAP database by hospital teams. INTERVENTIONS: Receiving ESD along the patient care pathway. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Length of hospital stay. RESULTS: When adjusted for important case-mix variables, patients who received ESD on their stroke care pathway spent longer in hospital, compared with those who did not receive ESD. The percentage increase was 15.8% (95% CI 12.3% to 19.4%) for the 2015–2016 cross-sectional analysis and 18.8% (95% CI 13.9% to 24.0%) for the 2013–2014 versus 2015–2016 repeated cross-sectional analysis. On average, the increased length of hospital stay was approximately 1 day. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that by comparing ESD and non-ESD patient groups matched for important patient characteristics, receiving ESD resulted in a 1-day increase in length of hospital stay. The large reduction in length of hospital stay overall, since original trials were conducted, may explain why a reduction was not observed. The longer term benefits of accessing ESD need to be investigated further.

19570,Early Empirical Tuberculosis Treatment in HIV-Positive Patients Admitted to Hospital in South Africa: An Observational Cohort Study,2021-03-31,"BACKGROUND: ‘Indirect’ causes of maternal death including concomitant illnesses such as infectious and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), accounted for 23% of maternal deaths in Indonesia in 2010. Reproductive-age women in Indonesia face a “double burden” of disease with increasing rates of NCDs and persisting rates of infectious disease. However, there is a lack of data on the burden of these diseases in pregnancy. The aim of this study was to estimate incidence of concomitant illnesses among pregnant women in Indonesia from 1990–2030. METHODS: Publicly available data was accessed including incidence of concomitant illnesses in Indonesian reproductive-age women, population data and crude birth rate data from 1990–2019, and formed basis for projections to 2030. A dataset of estimates for all variables was generated for each year and sampled from a binomial distribution. Using these estimates, pregnancy estimates and incidence in pregnant women were calculated. A cubic splines model was fitted to generate estimates of incidence of concomitant illnesses in pregnancy. FINDINGS: Past trends to 2019 show a decline in incident cases of infectious diseases except for HIV/AIDs, and an increase in most NCDs. In 2019, the most common disease was sexually transmitted infections. From 2020–2030, incidences of diabetes and lower respiratory infections are estimated to continue to increase. INTERPRETATION: With an increasing incidence of NCDs and high-incidence of infectious diseases in pregnancy, Indonesian policymakers and stakeholders should consider what evidence-based strategies and interventions are best to reduce potential impacts of concomitant illnesses on pregnancy outcomes.

23736,"Sickle Cell Disease and Acute Chest Syndrome: Epidemiology, Diagnosis, Management, Outcomes",2016-06-11,"Congenital malaria is rare and usually indolent but can be fatal. Mortality risk is high in newborns with Plasmodium falciparum born to nonimmune women, who typically present at birth or soon thereafter. Semi-immune women are less likely to transmit malaria, and their children often become ill weeks after delivery with less severe symptoms. Cases in the USA usually trace to semi-immune immigrant mothers whose last exposure to malaria may have preceded the pregnancy, leading to misdiagnoses. Congenital malaria may be under-recognized in malaria-endemic areas since parasitemia occurring after the first week of life is usually attributed to mosquito transmission. Malaria prophylaxis and the absence of fever during pregnancy do not preclude congenital malaria in a newborn. Quinine plus clindamycin is commonly used to treat P. falciparum congenital malaria, and chloroquine is used to treat other malaria parasites, such as Plasmodium vivax. Severe cases should be managed with intravenous quinine (available as its enantiomer quinidine in the USA) or with intravenous artesunate, which was recently approved for investigational use by the US FDA. Primaquine is not required for infants with congenital P. vivax or Plasmodium ovale, but should be offered to their mothers after excluding G6PD deficiency.","Harrington, Whitney E; Duffy, Patrick E",Ped Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117599/,245

However, their treatment effects remain limited due to the compromised accumulation of both drugs and inhibitors in certain tumor tissues. Herein, a new poly (acrylamide-co-acrylonitrile-co-vinylimidazole-co-bis(2-methacryloyl) oxyethyl disulfide) (PAAVB) polymer-based intelligent platform with controllable upper critical solution temperature (UCST) was used for the simultaneous delivery of paclitaxel (PTX) and curcumin (CUR). Additionally, a hyaluronic acid (HA) layer was coated on the surface of PAAVB NPs to target the CD44-overexpressed tumor cells. The proposed nanomedicine demonstrated a gratifying accumulation in tumor tissue and uptake by cancer cells. Then, the acidic microenvironment and high level of glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells could spontaneously decrease the UCST of polymer, leading to the disassembly of the NPs and rapid drug release at body temperature without extra-stimuli. Significantly, the released PTX and CUR could induce the immunogenic cell death (ICD) to promote adaptive anti-tumor immunogenicity and inhibit immunosuppression through suppressing the activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) enzyme respectively. Therefore, the synergism of this intelligent nanomedicine can suppress primary breast tumor growth and inhibit their lung metastasis.","Wang, Ying; Gao, Di; Liu, Yan; Guo, Xiaoqing; Chen, Shuojia; Zeng, Li; Ma, Jinxuan; Zhang, Xingcai; Tian, Zhongmin; Yang, Zhe",Bioact Mater,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7689277/,245

This study aims to assess the impact of TTS after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) on long-term and short-term outcomes in LAGC patients. METHODS: Data were collected from patients with LAGC who underwent NACT between January 2007 and January 2018 at our institution. Outcomes assessed were long-term survival, pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: This cohort of 426 patients was divided into five groups by weeks of TTS.

Familial Cluster of COVID-19 Cases Associated with High Prevalence of Anosmia, Ageusia, and Gastrointestinal Symptoms",2020-12-31,"The year 2020 marks the start of the implementation of the Renewable Portfolio Standards in the Philippines. To raise the country’s renewable energy (RE) share to 35% by 2030 (aspirational target), an annual minimum incremental RE of 1% has been imposed to all mandated participants. This local-level policy implementation has allowed the assessment of RE resource adequacy to be carried out on a smaller geographical scale (i.e., province level). The case for grid-connected island provinces, such as our study area, can be more interesting because of the opportunity to self-sustainable energy production. In this paper, we assess the adequacy of domestic RE resources of Bohol province to reach this target by estimating the technical potential of solar, wind, biomass, and hydropower using spatio-temporal datasets. Then, for every identified potential RE project, we calculate the busbar levelized cost. We also evaluate the province's base RE share to assess the extent to which the technical potential can improve its RE penetration in four distinct domestic and imported energy generation scenarios. With 20 different scenarios of additional RE capacity, we generate RE portfolios for the minimum target RE share (35%), as well as the 50% and maximum. The results revealed that, when the country’s RE penetration continues, Bohol’s hydropower potential is not enough to meet the 35% target. Seasonal renewables are also insufficient for a 50% target. In several scenarios, the province’s energy self-sustainability can be possible at reasonable costs when variable RE technologies are included in the portfolio.","Pojadas, Dave J.; Abundo, Michael Lochinvar Sim",Int J Energy Environ Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7775798/,245

In this context, deliberative democratic concepts, especially “mini-publics,” are gaining attention. Generally, mini-publics are conducted with randomly selected lay citizens who provide sufficient information to deliberate on issues and form final recommendations. Evaluations are conducted by practitioner researchers and independent researchers, but the results are not standardized. In this study, a systematic review of existing research regarding practices and outcomes of mini-publics was conducted. To analyze 29 papers, the evaluation methodologies were divided into 4 categories of a matrix between the evaluator and evaluated data. The evaluated cases mainly focused on the following two points: (1) how to maintain deliberation quality, and (2) the feasibility of mini-publics. To create a new path to the political decision-making process through mini-publics, it must be demonstrated that mini-publics can contribute to the decision-making process and good-quality deliberations are of concern to policy-makers and experts. Mini-publics are feasible if they can contribute to the political decision-making process and practitioners can evaluate and understand the advantages of mini-publics for each case. For future research, it is important to combine practical case studies and academic research, because few studies have been evaluated by independent researchers.","Ayano, Takeuchi",Asia-Pac J Reg Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7775829/,245

Tocilizumab in the Treatment of Critical COVID-19 Pneumonia,2020-12-31,"Infections due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB), especially when carbapenem resistant, have been very difficult to manage in the last fifteen years, owing to the paucity of dependable therapeutic options. Cefiderocol is a siderophore cephalosporin recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) that may have the potential to fill some of the remaining gaps in the treatment of MDR-GNB infections. Among others, cefiderocol demonstrated in vitro activity against carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and metallo-β-lactamases producers. Clinical data from both registrative studies and post-marketing experiences are essential to confirm whether these promises from in vitro studies could readily translate into clinical practice, as well as to delineate the precise place in therapy for cefiderocol for the treatment of MDR-GNB in the near future. Because of its unique potential, it is essential to provide both randomized controlled trials (RCT) and real-life data to improve the ability of clinicians to exploit its benefit in both empirical and targeted treatment of MDR-GNB infections. In this narrative review, we discuss the emerging data from pivotal RCT and initial real-life experiences on the use of cefiderocol for the treatment of MDR-GNB infections.","Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; Ciacco, Eugenio; Girmenia, Corrado; Pea, Federico; Rossolini, Gian Maria; Sotgiu, Giovanni; Tascini, Carlo; Tumbarello, Mario; Viale, Pierluigi; Bassetti, Matteo",Infect Drug Resist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7778378/,245

Describing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV care in Latin America,2020-12-31,"Metallization of polyethylene (PE) using thermal spray techniques has proved difficult due to its low melting point and softness. In this study, metallic coatings were applied on porous polyethylene substrates using a twin wire-arc spray process. Commercially available polyethylene sheets, 3 mm in thickness, were used as substrates. Copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), and zinc (Zn) were successfully deposited on the porous polymer, without prior surface preparation, to form coatings with thickness of about 400 µm. Coating surface morphology and cross-sections were examined using a scanning electron microscope. Individual metal splats on the porous and non-porous substrates were observed to study the differences in the bonding mechanisms. The adhesion strength and electrical resistivity of the coatings on porous PE were evaluated. It was found that the bond strength of all three metallic coatings was found to be higher than the ultimate fracture strength of the porous. These results suggest that porosity in the polymer helps to overcome the challenges of metallizing polyethylene and provides a significant reduction in the weight of the polymer. Therefore, all these properties aided in fabricating an extremely lightweight, composite material with potential use in thermal management applications.","Devaraj, S.; McDonald, A.; Chandra, S.",J Therm Spray Tech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7778840/,245

Nd: YAG laser with the wavelength of 1064 nm was employed to perform the laser ablation in pure water and Pometia pinnata (P. pinnata) leaf extract, with the leaf, were extracted in pure water and some concentration of ethanol. ZnO nanoparticles can be obtained via laser ablation in pure water, while the usage of P. pinnata leaf extract as the solution has caused the appearance of the bi-phase Zn/ZnO nanostructure. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern indicates the appearance of Zn peaks alongside with ZnO peaks with the inclusion of P. pinnata leaf extract. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images show the change of shape from the rod-like shape into a spherical shape and smaller size spherical shape of Zn/ZnO nanoparticles in comparison with ZnO.

Learner Driven Call Center to increase Convalescent Plasma Donation in COVID-19,2020-12-31,"In this paper, a methodology for design of Kalman filter, using interval type-2 fuzzy systems, in discrete time domain, via spectral decomposition of experimental data, is proposed. The adopted methodology consists of recursive parametric estimation of local state space linear submodels of interval type-2 fuzzy Kalman filter for tracking and forecasting of the dynamics inherited to experimental data, using an interval type-2 fuzzy version of Observer/Kalman Filter Identification (OKID) algorithm. The partitioning of the experimental data is performed by interval type-2 fuzzy Gustafson–Kessel clustering algorithm. The interval Kalman gains in the consequent proposition of interval type-2 fuzzy Kalman filter are updated according to unobservable components computed by recursive spectral decomposition of experimental data. Results illustrate the efficiency of proposed methodology, as compared to other approach widely cited in the literature, for filtering and tracking the state variables of Lorenz’s chaotic attractor in a noisy environment, and its applicability for adaptive and real-time forecasting the dynamic spread behavior of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in state of Maranhão and Brazil.","dos Santos Gomes, Daiana Caroline; de Oliveira Serra, Ginalber Luiz",J Control Autom Electr Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7778872/,245

PMS forms were collected from 284 patients (182 with HL, 101 with sALCL and one with another lymphoma) treated between April and September 2014. The median age was 62 (range 14–93) years and the median number of treatment cycles was 5.5 for HL and 4 for sALCL. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported in 74.3% of patients. The most commonly observed ADRs included peripheral sensory neuropathy (39.1%; grade ≥ 3, 6.3%), neutropenia (34.5%; grade ≥ 3, 22.2%) and lymphopenia (7.0%; grade ≥ 3, 5.3%). Ten patients had fatal ADRs including interstitial lung disease (n = 3). This study showed that BV has an acceptable safety profile in Japanese patients with R/R HL and R/R sALCL in the clinical practice setting. However, close monitoring rare, but potentially fatal, ADRs such as pulmonary toxicity may be warranted, especially in patients with prior or ongoing pulmonary disorders.

43928,431. Geospatial prediction model of COVID-19 outbreak in New York State,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a crucial risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its underlying mechanism remains understudied. METHODS: Microarray analysis was conducted to compare the genes and miRNAs in liver tissue from HBV-positive and HBV-negative HCC patients. Biological functions of these biomarkers in HBV-related HCC were validated via in vitro and in vivo experiments. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of HBV on the proliferation and migration of tumor cells in HBV-positive HCC tissue. Bioinformatics analysis was then performed to validate the clinical value of the biomarkers in a large HCC cohort. RESULTS: We found that a gene, MINPP1 from the glycolytic bypass metabolic pathway, has an important biological function in the development of HBV-positive HCC. MINPP1 is down-regulated in HBV-positive HCC and could inhibit the proliferation and migration of the tumor cells. Meanwhile, miRNA-30b-5p was found to be a stimulator for the proliferation of tumor cell through glycolytic bypass in HBV-positive HCC. More importantly, miRNA-30b-5p could significantly downregulate MINPP1 expression. Metabolic experiments showed that the miRNA-30b-5p/MINPP1 axis is able to accelerate the conversion of glucose to lactate and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG). In the HBV-negative HCC cells, miRNA-30b-5p/MINPP1 could not regulate the glycolytic bypass to promote the tumorigenesis. However, once HBV was introduced into these cells, miRNA-30b-5p/MINPP1 significantly enhanced the proliferation, migration of tumor cells, and promoted the glycolytic bypass. We further revealed that HBV infection promoted the expression of miRNA-30b-5p through the interaction of HBV protein P (HBp) with FOXO3. Bioinformatics analysis on a large cohort dataset showed that high expression of MINPP1 was associated with favorable survival of HBV-positive HCC patients, which could lead to a slower progress of this disease. CONCLUSION: Our study found that the HBp/FOXO3/miRNA-30b-5p/MINPP1 axis contributes to the development of HBV-positive HCC cells through the glycolytic bypass. We also presented miRNA-30b-5p/MINPP1 as a novel biomarker for HBV-positive HCC early diagnosis and a potential pharmaceutical target for antitumor therapy.

Characteristics and Outcomes of COVID-19 Patients with Fungal Infections,2020-12-31,"ABSTRACT: Streptomyces is one of the most versatile genera for biotechnological applications, widely employed as platform in the production of drugs. Although streptomycetes have a complex life cycle and metabolism that would need multidisciplinary approaches, review papers have generally reported only studies on single aspects like the isolation of new strains and metabolites, morphology investigations, and genetic or metabolic studies. Besides, even if streptomycetes are extensively used in industry, very few review papers have focused their attention on the technical aspects of biotechnological processes of drug production and bioconversion and on the key parameters that have to be set up. This mini-review extensively illustrates the most innovative developments and progresses in biotechnological production and bioconversion processes of antibiotics, immunosuppressant, anticancer, steroidal drugs, and anthelmintic agents by streptomycetes, focusing on the process development aspects, describing the different approaches and technologies used in order to improve the production yields. The influence of nutrients and oxygen on streptomycetes metabolism, new fed-batch fermentation strategies, innovative precursor supplementation approaches, and specific bioreactor design as well as biotechnological strategies coupled with metabolic engineering and genetic tools for strain improvement is described. The use of whole, free, and immobilized cells on unusual supports was also reported for bioconversion processes of drugs. The most outstanding thirty investigations published in the last 8 years are here reported while future trends and perspectives of biotechnological research in the field have been illustrated. KEY POINTS: • Updated Streptomyces biotechnological processes for drug production are reported. • Innovative approaches for Streptomyces-based biotransformation of drugs are reviewed. • News about fermentation and genome systems to enhance secondary metabolite production.","Barbuto Ferraiuolo, Simona; Cammarota, Marcella; Schiraldi, Chiara; Restaino, Odile Francesca",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7780072/,245

Prevalence of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic COVID-19 Infection in Pregnant Women and Their Infants in an Urban Hospital,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to explore the relationship between the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the early clinical outcomes in children with congenital heart disease (CHD) associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) after cardiac surgery. METHODS: A retrospective observational study involving 190 children from January 2013 to August 2019 was conducted. Perioperative clinical and biochemical data were collected. RESULTS: We found that pre-operative NLR was significantly correlated with AST, STB, CR and UA (P < 0.05), while post-operative NLR was significantly correlated with ALT, AST, BUN (P < 0.05). Increased post-operative neutrophil count and NLR as well as decreased lymphocyte count could be observed after cardiac surgery (P < 0.05). Level of pre-operative NLR was significantly correlated with mechanical ventilation time, ICU stay time and total length of stay (P < 0.05), while level of post-operative NLR was only significantly correlated to the first two (P < 0.05). By using ROC curve analysis, relevant areas under the curve for predicting prolonged mechanical ventilation time beyond 24 h, 48 h and 72 h by NLR were statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: For patients with CHD-PAH, NLR was closely related to early post-operative complications and clinical outcomes, and could act as a novel marker to predict the occurrence of prolonged mechanical ventilation.","Yin, Xiaoqiang; Xin, Mei; Ding, Sheng; Gao, Feng; Wu, Fan; Wang, Jian; Chen, Jie; Jiang, Li; Wu, Xiaochen; Wang, Xianying; Liu, Jingzhen; Zhang, Jinbao; He, Siyi",BMC Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7780205/,245

Here, we characterized the function of mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 from Oryza officinalis Wall. ex Watt encoded by OrMKK3. Different alternative splicing variants occurred in OrMKK3. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)–OrMKK3 fusion proteins localized to the cell membrane and nuclei of rice protoplasts. Overexpression of OrMKK3 influenced the expression levels of the grain size-related genes SMG1, GW8, GL3, GW2, and DEP3. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OrMKK3 is well conserved in plants while showing large amounts of variation between indica, japonica, and wild rice. In addition, OrMKK3 slightly influenced brassinosteroid (BR) responses and the expression levels of BR-related genes. Our findings thus identify a new gene, OrMKK3, influencing morphology and grain size and that represents a possible link between mitogen-activated protein kinase and BR response pathways in grain growth.

43972,429. County-level predictors of COVID-19 testing across the 62 counties in New York State: A comparison across machine learning algorithms,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The term ‘life limiting conditions’ refers to premature death following decline from chronic conditions, which is a common circumstance in which occupational therapists work with people at the end of life. The challenges for clinicians of working with these patients have long been recognised, and may have a significant impact on their professional self-care. This study aimed to evaluate a multidimensional workplace strategy to improve the professional self-care of occupational therapists working with people living with a life limiting condition. METHODS: A pre and post mixed methods survey approach were utilised, with baseline data collection prior to the implementation of a multidimensional workplace strategy. The strategy included professional resilience education, targeted supervision prompts, changes to departmental culture and the promotion of self-care services across multiple organisational levels. Follow up data collection was undertaken after the strategy had been in place for 2 years. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively, while qualitative data were subjected to thematic analysis. RESULTS: One hundred three occupational therapists responded (n = 55 pre, n = 48 post) across multiple service settings. Complex emotional responses and lived experiences were identified by participants working with patients with life limiting conditions, which were not influenced by the workplace strategy. Working with these patients was acknowledged to challenge the traditional focus of occupational therapy on rehabilitation and recovery. Participants were confident about their ability to access self-care support, and supervision emerged as a key medium. While the strategy increased the proportion of occupational therapists undertaking targeted training, around half identified ongoing unmet need around professional self-care with this patient group. Demographic factors (e.g. practice setting, years of experience) also had a significant impact on the experience and needs of participants. CONCLUSIONS: The multidimensional workplace strategy resulted in some improvements in professional self-care for occupational therapists, particularly around their use of supervision and awareness of available support resources. However, it did not impact upon their lived experience of working with people with life limiting conditions, and there remain significant gaps in our knowledge of support strategies for self-care of occupational therapist working with this patient group.","Apostol, Courtney; Cranwell, Kathryn; Hitch, Danielle",BMC Palliat Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7781397/,245

There are only two studies which investigated the association of Rh blood groups in addition to ABO with COVID-19; however, in the statistical analysis ABO and Rh blood groups have been considered separately. Therefore, the present case-control study was performed to determine the association of COVID-19 with ABO blood groups considering the Rh blood groups simultaneously. The study was conducted in Kunduz COVID-19 treatment specific center, Spin-Zar Hospital (Kunduz Province, North East Afghanistan). A total of 301 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1039 healthy blood donors as control group were included in the study. RESULTS: The Rh(−) phenotype strongly increased the risk of COVID-19 (OR = 2.97, 95% CI 1.86–3.89, P < 0.001). Although blood group A increased the risk of developing COVID-19, the association did not reach statistical significance. In analysis of the combination phenotypes, the A(−) blood group remarkably increased the risk of COVID-19 (OR = 7.24, 95% CI 3.62–14.4, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that the interaction of Rh and ABO is significant (P < 0.013).

We aimed to assess the incidence of PE in patients with COVID-19 infection and to evaluate the relationship between the CT severity of the disease and the laboratory indicators. This was a retrospective study conducted on 96 patients with COVID-19 infection proved by positive PCR who underwent CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) with a calculation of the CT severity of COVID-19 infection. Available patients’ complaint and laboratory data at the time of CTPA were correlated with PE presence and disease severity. RESULTS: Forty patients (41.7%) showed positive PE with the median time for the incidence of PE which was 12 days after onset of the disease. No significant correlation was found between the incidence of PE and the patients’ age, sex, laboratory results, and the CT severity of COVID-19. A statistically significant relation was found between the incidence of PE and the patients’ desaturation, hemoptysis, and chest pain. A highly significant correlation was found between the incidence of PE and the rising in the D-dimer level as well as the progressive CT findings when compared to the previous one. CONCLUSION: CT progression and the rising in D-dimer level are considered the most important parameters suggesting underlying PE in patients with positive COVID-19 infection which is commonly seen during the second week of infection and alert the use of CT pulmonary angiography to exclude or confirm PE.

44023,LB-6. Increased Diagnoses of Acute HIV Infection through Routine ED Screening and Rapid Linkage to Care and initiation of HAART During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-12-31,"In this paper I aim to show why pediatric suffering must be understood as a judgment or evaluation, rather than a mental state. To accomplish this task, first I analyze the various ways that the label of suffering is used in pediatric practice. Out of this analysis emerge what I call the twin poles of pediatric suffering. At one pole sits the belief that infants and children with severe cognitive impairment cannot suffer because they are nonverbal or lack subjective life experience. At the other pole exists the idea that once child suffering reaches some threshold it is ethical to eliminate the sufferer. Concerningly, at both poles, any particular child vanishes from view. Second, in an attempt to identify a theory of suffering inclusive of children, I examine two prominent so-called experiential accounts of suffering. I find them both wanting on account of their absurd entailments and their flawed assumptions regarding the subjective experiences of people who cannot communicate expressively. Finally, I extend arguments found in Alastair MacIntyre’s Dependent Rational Animals to argue that child suffering can be understood only as a set of absences—absences of conditions such as love, warmth, and freedom from pain. An evaluation of these absences reveals the exquisite dependency of children. It also discloses why pediatric suffering is necessarily a social and political event. Unlike adults, children will never be either the authors or the mitigators of their own suffering. Rather, children must rely wholly on others in order to resist suffering, grow, and flourish.","Tate, Tyler",Theor Med Bioeth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7784220/,245

Also, some of radiation dose reduction techniques in CT would be mentioned, because using these techniques or low-dose protocol can decrease the radiation burden on the population. MAIN BODY: Chest CT scan can play a key diagnostic role in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, it can be useful to monitor imaging changes during treatment. However, CT scan overuse during the COVID-19 pandemic raises concerns about radiation-induced adverse effects, both in patients and healthcare workers. CONCLUSION: By evaluating the CT scanning parameters used in several studies, one can find the necessity for optimizing these parameters. It has been found that chest CT scan taken using low-dose CT protocol is a reliable diagnostic tool to detect COVID-19 pneumonia in daily practice. Moreover, the low-dose chest CT protocol results in a remarkable reduction (up to 89%) in the radiation dose compared to the standard-dose protocol, not lowering diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19-induced pneumonia in CT images. Therefore, its employment in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly recommended.","Azadbakht, Javid; Khoramian, Daryoush; Lajevardi, Zahra Sadat; Elikaii, Fateme; Aflatoonian, Amir Hossein; Farhood, Bagher; Najafi, Masoud; Bagheri, Hamed",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7784224/,245

However, the incidence of nosocomial Covid-19 infection in U.S. acute care hospitals is unknown. METHODS: We conducted an observational study of all patients admitted to Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts between March 7 (when the first Covid-19 patient was admitted) and May 30, 2020. During this period, a comprehensive infection control program was implemented including dedicated Covid-19 units with airborne infection isolation rooms, personal protective equipment (PPE) in accordance with CDC recommendations, PPE donning and doffing monitors, universal masking, restriction of visitors, and liberal RT-PCR testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. We reviewed the medical records of all patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR on hospital day 3 or later or within 14 days of hospital discharge to determine whether infection was community or hospital-acquired based on timing of RT-PCR tests, clinical course, and exposures. RESULTS: Over the 12-week period, 9,149 patients were admitted, in whom 7,394 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were performed and 697 Covid-19 cases were confirmed, translating into a total 8,656 days of Covid-19-related care (Figure). The inpatient Covid-19 census peaked at 171 on April 21. Twelve of the 697 Covid-19 patients (1.7%) were first diagnosed by RT-PCR on hospital day 3 or later (median 4 days, range 3–15 days). Of these, only one was deemed hospital-acquired and was most likely acquired from his pre-symptomatic spouse who was visiting daily and diagnosed with Covid-19 before visitor restrictions were implemented. Amongst 8,370 non-Covid-19 patients discharged through June 17, 11 (0.1%) subsequently tested positive within 14 days (median time to diagnosis 6 days, range 1–14).

Comparison of Viral Loads in Individuals With or Without Symptoms At Time of COVID-19 Testing Among 32,480 Residents and Staff of Nursing Homes and Assisted Living Facilities in Massachusetts",2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, tenofovir (TAF/TDF) was identified as a potential agent for SARS-CoV-2 due to binding to RNA-dependent RNA polymerase similarly to remdesivir. This led to the hypothesis that TAF/TDF may be lessening the severity and improving outcomes of COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 Severity [Image: see text] COVID-19 Infection Outcomes [Image: see text] METHODS: Patients were identified by searching for HIV infection and SARS-CoV2 PCR testing. Type of antiretroviral therapy (ART), CD4+ cell count, HIV viral load (VL), comorbidities, presenting symptoms, severity of COVID infection, and outcomes were analyzed. COVID disease was classified as mild, moderate, severe, or critical based on World Health Organization criteria. We primarily sought to determine the effect of TAF/TDF on the severity of COVID infection. The secondary endpoint was to determine the effect of low CD4 count and HIV VL on the severity of infection. RESULTS: 39 HIV+ patients were tested at least once for SARS-CoV2 by PCR at VA NJ Health Care System. 18 of 39 patients were PCR positive. In those, common presenting symptoms included: fever (15/18), cough (7/18), and lethargy/fatigue (6/18). 16 of the 39 HIV+ patients’ ART included TAF/TDF; 8 of 18 COVID+ and 8 of 21 COVID-. In the COVID- group, 2 patients had CD4 count < 200 cells/mm(3), 3 patients had HIV VL >200, and 19 of 21 had at least 1 comorbidity. In the COVID+ group, 3 had CD4 count < 200 cells/mm(3), none had detectible HIV viremia, and all but one had comorbidities. Of COVID+ infections, 7 were mild, 3 moderate, 8 severe, and 5 patients died. 4 of the 5 patients that did not survive were in non-TAF/TDF group. All 3 patients with CD4 count < 200 cells/mm(3) had severe disease. 6 out of 8 patients developed mild disease in TAF/TDF group vs. 1 out of 10 patients in non-TAF/TDF group. 1 out of 8 and 7 out of 10 patients had severe or critical disease in TAF/TDF vs non-TAF/TDF groups respectively. CONCLUSION: In this sample of 18 HIV+ patients with COVID-19 infection, patients receiving TAF/TDF were more likely to develop mild disease and have full recovery than those who were on TAF/TDF-free regimens (75% vs. 10% and 87.5% vs. 50%, respectively). Patients not on TAF/TDF-based regimens had a higher rate of developing severe and critical COVID-19 disease (40% vs. 0% and 30% vs. 12.5%, respectively).

44050,531. COVID-19 infection outcome in African American Renal Transplant recipients: Detroit Medical Center experience,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCW) are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Infection prevention and control methods to prevent HCWs from bringing the virus home are lacking. We aimed to describe the various isolation practices of COVID positive (+) physicians and advanced practice providers to mitigate transmission risk to family members (FM) and understand HCW stress during this pandemic. METHODS: Survey responses were collected from 5/19/2020 - 6/12/2020 using a convenience sampling of HCW. Solicitations were done through email, listservs, institutional websites, and Facebook groups without geographic restriction. We collected data on demographics, details about HCW illness, health of FM, preventive measures taken, and HCW stress. RESULTS: The survey has so far been completed by 51 COVID+ respondents with FM in the home (Table 1). Half (55%) work in outpatient, 31% inpatient, and 8% in ER setting. Most HCW (83%) were diagnosed by PCR test; others were presumptive positive due to symptoms and exposure (14%). 64% had mild disease and 33% had moderate disease. Most common preventive measures were immediate showering after reaching home (59%) and changing clothes prior to going home (35%); 22% took no precautions. About 55% of FM developed symptoms of COVID. There were no significant differences between preventive measures taken by HCW whose FM remained asymptomatic. However, we noted that HCW whose FM remained symptom-free were more likely to sleep in a separate room (17% vs. 7%), refrain from physical contact with FM (22% vs.14%) and intimate contact with partners (22% vs. 11%). Over 88% reported increased stress level, many identifying health concerns and safety (26%) and impact on FM (28%) as the greatest source of stress. There was no difference in reported stress level between HCW whose FM became infected and those who were not. HCW with symptom-free FM were more concerned about transmission to their partner (p = 0.02). Table 1 [Image: see text] Table 2 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: This is the first survey of its kind which, although limited by total respondents, indicates that HCW are taking a variety of approaches to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to their FM. We did not find a significant impact of individual preventive measures on the risk of transmission. Regardless of the FM illness, most HCW have increased stress due to impact of COVID.

44053,479. Mobility Restrictions and COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak Control,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 transmission is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Respiratory protection devices, when properly fitted and used, can prevent this type of illness transmission. METHODS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) within the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is responsible for the certification and approval of respirators for use in occupational settings. NPPTL maintains webpages with information on respiratory protection devices. We monitored the number of webpage views for several NPPTL webpages from January 1, 2020 to May 8, 2020. The number of webpage visits was then compared to significant events during the COVID-19 outbreak as well as the previous year’s webpage visits. RESULTS: The landing page for NIOSH-approved N95 respirators received the most visits. This page received a total of 1,637,250 webpage visits with a peak of 63,715 on February 26, 2020, a 38,989% increase from the average daily page visits for that same month in 2019. This occurred on the same day as the White House gave its first televised briefing on COVID-19. The page providing general information on filtering facepiece respirators, including N95 respirators received 834,186 webpage visits with a peak of 20,520 on April 3, 2020, a 13,659% increase from the average daily webpage visits for that same month in 2019. This occurred on the same date as new CDC recommendations were provided for using cloth face masks in public places. The counterfeit respirator page maintained a steady, but small number of webpage visits, but increased from 4,261 on March 27, 2020 to 68,145 on March 29, 2020. This occurred as the first reports of fraudulent respirators were being published in the media. It then fell to 18,562 on March 30, 2020 and 13,093 on March 31, 2020. While most webpage visits were from the United States, visits from China, and Canada were higher than previous years. CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 there was a large increase in the number of webpage visits for respiratory protection information which coincided with major events and media reports. Accurate, accessible respiratory protection information is an important resource during public health emergencies.

44063,522. The Simple and Novel SAS Score to Predict Mortality at Presentation in 2541 Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on medical student education. As the pandemic spread nationwide, numerous universities shut down with only days’ notice, and medical students were removed from all patient care settings and restricted from campuses. Yet, the need and curiosity of these future physicians to understand this new disease was great, including how to interpret and integrate rapidly evolving information on the underlying viral and immune mechanisms, pathophysiology, and epidemiology. Time students spent away from patient care settings presented an opportunity to rapidly develop and deliver new curriculum covering SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. METHODS: A team of students and faculty at Indiana University developed a Fundamentals of COVID-19 course that included up-to-date information on the virology, immunology, and pathophysiology of COVID-19. The course was delivered online, with both synchronous and asynchronous activities. Virology and immunology of the coronavirus family, including current knowledge to-date of SARS-CoV-2, were delivered using a series of readings and brief videos, followed by a small group exercise that required students to choose and present to their peers a paper from the scientific literature on COVID-19. A similar approach was used to deliver content about the pathophysiology of COVID-19. To place the COVID-19 experience in context of other pandemics, students researched and educated their small group cohort on another historical pandemic. RESULTS: To measure course effectiveness, we administered a pre-course survey gauging students’ self-confidence in their knowledge of these topics; the same survey was administered after completion of the course. Surveys from 645 (89% of enrolled) 3(rd) and 4(th) year medical students who completed both surveys were analyzed. Results showed that the course elicited a 57% increase (p< 0.001) in students’ confidence in their knowledge of COVID-19 virology and immunology and a 64% increase (p< 0.001) in knowledge of the pathophysiology. CONCLUSION: Data showed that the asynchronous content and group activities were successful in engaging and educating the students on foundational knowledge of COVID-19 and were an effective approach to rapidly evolving information when faced with a novel disease.

44072,551. Convalescent plasma early in disease course improves survival in COVID-19,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Most diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, are RT-PCR based. This method is sensitive but cannot distinguish replicating from non-replicating virus. RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values are inversely correlated with viral load, and higher Ct values have been correlated with lower in vitro viral infectivity. However, relatively few data exist on the association between Ct values and patients’ duration of symptoms remains unclear. We thus evaluated Ct values and symptom duration in a cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: We assessed all patients admitted to San Francisco General Hospital between April 1 and May 18, 2020 with confirmed COVID-19 infection based on RT-PCR testing (Abbott m2000 platform). We included patients having diagnostic testing for suspected COVID-19 and patients having asymptomatic testing per hospital policy. For symptomatic patients, date of symptom onset was abstracted from hospital records, and time from symptom onset to test date was calculated. RT-PCR Ct values were manually extracted. Median Ct and IQR were calculated for patients with < 10 days of symptoms, ≥10 days of symptoms, and asymptomatic disease. Between-group comparisons were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: Among 61 patients with positive RT-PCR tests, 40 patients reported < 10 days of symptoms at the time of testing, 15 reported ≥10 days of symptoms, and 6 were asymptomatic. The median Ct value was 14.2 cycles (IQR, 10.2, 18.3) among patients reporting < 10 days of symptoms, 19.7 cycles (IQR, 15.3, 23.9) among patients reporting ≥10 days of symptoms, and 26.3 (IQR, 25.0, 29.1) among asymptomatic patients. Ct values were significantly lower among patients with < 10 days of symptoms compared to patients with >=10 days of symptoms (p=0.01) and when compared to asymptomatic patients (p=0.0002) [Figure]. Cycle threshold (Ct) by days of symptoms at time of testing [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR cycle threshold values were higher (indicating lower viral load) in patients with longer symptom duration and were highest in asymptomatic patients. These results add to emerging data suggesting that strategies for optimal isolation of patients in both community and hospital settings could be informed by a combination of symptom duration and RT-PCR Ct values.

44076,181. Antimicrobial Use in the Time of COVID-19 – Data from 84 VA Facilities,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus-19-disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread to >200 countries and surpassed 7 million cases. There is a broad range of COVID-19 illness, ranging from milder disease to a rapidly progressive respiratory disease and ARDS. The causes of this different clinical course and the drivers for severe disease are currently unknown. A fulminant increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines is thought to play a role in causing a rapid disease evolution, however the immune correlates of severe COVID-19 remain unclear. METHODS: To gain insight into relationship between immune responses and disease severity we built a longitudinal cohort of 40 adult patients with known COVID-19. Samples were collected at diagnosis and every 7 days until hospital discharge or death. As controls we also included a group of convalescent patients, and subjects who tested negative for COVID-19 by PCR. Clinical and laboratory data and were also collected. Multicolor flow cytometry was used to determine the presence and phenotype of B, T and natural killer (NK) cells. We also identified specific sub-populations (Tfh, activated/cytotoxic CD8 and NK) and assessed lymphoid exhaustion of different cell types such as naïve, memory T cells, or NK over time. Anti-Sars-CoV2 IgG and IgM antibody were detected using lateral flow method. RESULTS: We found that the absolute number of lymphocytes and monocytes was decreased starting at diagnosis and correlated with disease severity. Disease severity correlated with decreased NK and T cell. In severe COVID-19 cases, NK cell populations were strongly decreased over time in intubated patients while they recovered in patients who improved and were discharged. CD8+ were also decreased at disease onset and seemed to correlate with disease severity. A high percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed an exhausted phenotype. All patients tested at admission had IgM antibody responses irrespective of the course of the disease. Further analyses are ongoing. CONCLUSION: The characterization and role of the immune responses in COVID-19 evolution is still under investigation. Further characterization of viral and immune factors will help in identifying subjects at high risk of severe disease and targets for intervention.

44077,75. Systemic Anticoagulation Use Is Independently Associated with Lower Mortality in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients with D-dimer Level Higher Than 5 Mcg/ml,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: As of June 3(rd), 2020, the number of confirmed cases of novel SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, was approximately 6,538,456, with 386,503 deaths globally. Individuals with pre-existing conditions are particularly susceptible to and more likely to die from Covid-19. However, individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are unique due to their use of antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitors, which have been used to treat COVID-19. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis exploring the prevalence and prevalence of HIV in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and delineating the mortality rates. METHODS: MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library databases and medrxiv.org were searched from January 1st, 2020, to June 15th, 2020. Studies reporting on the prevalence of HIV among hospitalized COVID-19 patients among and outcome of mortality were extracted. Two reviewers independently extracted appropriate data of interest and assessed the risk of bias. All analyses were performed using random-effects models on log-transformed proportions and risk ratio estimates, and heterogeneity was quantified. RESULTS: A total of 144,795 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were identified from 14 studies (United States 8, Spain 3, China 1, Italy1, and Germany 1). The pooled prevalence of HIV in COVID-19 patients was 1.22 % [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61%-2.43%)] translating to a 2-fold increase compared to the respective local-level pooled HIV prevalence in the general population of 0.65% (95% CI: 0.48%-0.89%. When we stratified the analysis by country, pooled HIV prevalence among COVID-19 patients in United States (1.43%, 95% CI: 0.98% -2.07%) was significantly higher compared to Spain (0.26%, 95% CI: 0.23%-0.29%) but not different from China (0.99 %, 95% CI: 0.25 %-3.85%). The pooled mortality rates in HIV-positive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was 14.1 % 95% CI: 5.78%-30.50% and was substantially higher in the United States compared to other countries. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HIV among COVID-19 patients may be higher compared to the general population, suggesting higher susceptibility to COVID-19. The mortality rates are high but vary significantly across countries.

44082,56. Could Maturation Effect Contribute to In-hospital Mortality Improvement During COVID-19 Pandemic?,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people living with HIV (PWH) are unknown. Beyond SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, the pandemic may have devastating consequences for HIV care delivery. Understanding these is crucial as reduced antiretroviral therapy (ART) availability alone could lead to ≥500,000 AIDS-related deaths in 2020–2021. With Latin America now a focal point in the pandemic, we sought to describe the impact of COVID-19 on HIV care at Latin American clinical sites. METHODS: Caribbean, Central and South America network for HIV epidemiology (CCASAnet) and additional Brazilian HIV care sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, and Peru were included. An electronic survey of COVID-19 effects on HIV clinic operations was administered in Spanish or English via phone and email, April 28-June 2, 2020. We also compared national COVID-19 case, mortality, and policy data from public sources. RESULTS: Brazil’s and Mexico’s epidemics appear most pronounced, with >10,000 confirmed COVID-19-related deaths (Figure 1); countries implemented “social distancing” policies at different times after initial cases, with Haiti earliest and Mexico latest (Figure 2). Nearly all 13 sites reported decreased hours and providers for HIV care. Twelve of 13 reported increased use of telehealth, suspension/postponements of routine HIV appointments, and/or suspension of HIV research. Eleven of 13 reported initiation of new COVID-19 research but suspension of community HIV testing, and nearly half provided additional ART supplies. Nearly 70% reported impacts on HIV viral load testing and nearly 40% reported personal protective equipment stock-outs (Table). All 13 sites experienced changes in resources/services in tandem with national policies; there was wide variation, however, in the number of economic and health supports implemented thus far (e.g., quarantines, tax deferrals, interest rate reductions, etc.), from 172 COVID-19-related policies in Brazil to only 30 in Mexico.

44085,487. Patient Outcomes of Contact Tracing for COVID-19 in a Pediatric Hospital,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric providers have been caring for two new and similar respiratory illnesses: E-cigarette or vaping use associated lung injury (EVALI) beginning in 2019 and Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) in 2020. Similarities include prodrome, presentation, imaging, and laboratory testing. While EVALI often improves with steroid treatment, steroids can be detrimental early in the course of COVID-19. Although a positive SARS CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is helpful, this result does not definitively identify SARS CoV-2 as the primary cause of symptoms in patients with a history of vaping, as both processes may be coexistent. Coinfection with other infectious agents is commonly found in children with COVID-19 infection, and the majority of children with PCR positive SARS CoV-2 are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. METHODS: In hopes of better defining EVALI versus COVID-19 clinical syndromes, we reviewed charts of pediatric patients admitted to a freestanding children’s hospital in Texas diagnosed with EVALI over a year period from June 1, 2019 and June 1, 2020. Cases were identified through a local patient registry. We compared findings in these cases with literature regarding pediatric patients with acute COVID-19 and EVALI. Variables included presenting symptoms, timing of symptoms, vital signs, imaging, and laboratory results. RESULTS: Twelve patients with EVALI diagnosis were included. Clinical presentation, imaging, and laboratory findings were similar to those described with acute COVID-19 and are included in figures 1 and 2. Repeated interviewing regarding vaping revealed a history of vaping in all EVALI cases; frequency reported varied from multiple times daily to remote use. Some cases with EVALI also had a significant psychiatric history, positive urine drug screen, or significant weight loss prior to hospitalization. Cases with EVALI and steroid treatment improved within days of treatment. In a review of literature, BAL sampling often reveals lipoid pneumonia in EVALI cases, which would not be expected in COVID-19. Of note, the single case in our group tested did not have lipoid pneumonia on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytology. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Presence of prolonged preceding weight loss, or BAL cytology could help differentiate these clinical states.

44087,396. Relationship Between Patient Characteristics and Critical Illness in Patients Admitted for CoVID-19,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has emerged as a global public health emergency and has been the main cause of intensive care admission during the pandemic. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) superinfection has been reported in case series of critically ill patients. Mexico has been widely affected by SARS-CoV-2. We present a case series of COVID-19-associated IPA at a teaching hospital in Mexico City. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ABC Medical Center from March 13 to June 1, 2020. Only those with severe or critical COVID-19 were hospitalized. Patients with a diagnosis of putative IPA were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 was diagnosed by Real-Time PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Aspergillus antigen testing in tracheal aspirate and serum was done with Aspergillus-specific galactomannoprotein (GP) ELISA (Euroimmun Medizinische Labordiagnostika).The study was approved by the hospital ethics committee. RESULTS: Among the 47 admitted patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), we identified seven (14.9%) cases of IPA. The mean age was 59.7 ± 17.8 years and five were male. All our patients had comorbidities, but none were under previous immunosuppressive treatment. All had critical COVID-19 pneumonia requiring IMV. All but one patient received corticosteroids, and five patients were treated with tocilizumab before IPA diagnosis. Putative IPA was diagnosed in six cases (86%) by a positive GP in tracheal aspirate, additionally in one of these, the tracheal aspirate culture also grew Aspergillus niger. The remaining one (14%) had a positive serum GP. The median time from COVID-19 to IPA diagnosis was 10 days. There were five bacterial co-infections, three with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and one with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Six patients were treated with isavuconazole and one voriconazole. As of June 17, 2020, three patients had died, two patients had been discharged, and two were still in the intensive care unit receiving IMV. Aspergillus niger isolated from a tracheal aspirate of a critically-ill COVID-19 patient [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: COVID-19-associated IPA had a lower prevalence than previously reported in other series. However, it appears to be linked to high mortality and could be associated with other bacterial coinfections.

44088,381. HIV Patients with COVID-19 Hospitalized in a Tertiary Care Center in Mexico City,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: As only few studies have analyzed viral kinetics between the incubation and symptomatic periods of COVID-19 patients, we investigated the viral kinetics and compared viral loads between patients with mild and severe COVID-19. METHODS: We determined the viral kinetics of 10 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at Chosun University Hospital. Six patients were classified into the “mild” group and 4 into the “severe” group according to supplemental oxygen use during admission. Samples were collected via nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum specimens. SARS-CoV-2 was detected using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Chest radiograph scores during hospitalization were obtained RESULTS: Ct values of the upper respiratory tract specimens were low during the early stages after symptom onset but gradually increased over time in both groups. The severe group had lower Ct values than the mild group. The Ct values of the RdRP and E genes on day 6 after symptom onset were significantly lower in the severe group than in the mild group (p < 0.05). Three of 6 patients had positive results on RT-PCR even before symptom onset; 2 of them had the lowest Ct values. The chest radiograph scores were higher in the severe group than in the mild group, and the score in the severe group was the highest at approximately 3 weeks after symptom onset. Ct values when the RdRP gene and E gene were targeted to detect SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the days after symptom onset in all the patients [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Viral load and chest radiograph scores were significantly different between the severe and mild groups of COVID-19 patients.

44102,53. Incidence of Bloodstream Infections and Outcomes in Patients with Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The use of disposable or single-use filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), like N95s, are an important component of personal protective equipment for healthcare personnel in treating patients with a respiratory virus and not approved for reuse. The current pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in the limited availability of respirators. As a result, the decontamination of FFRs is a potential solution for reuse in order to conserve supplies. However, the efficacy of disinfection for a contaminated FFR needs to be evaluated. This experiment examined the effectiveness of a targeted ultraviolet C (UVC) device for the decontamination of a single-use respirator. METHODS: To mimic an aerosolized droplet contaminating a cellulose based respirator, a 6 mm cotton disk was inoculated with a 10 μL aliquot of Bacillus subtilis endospores. The disks were placed directly under the UVC light with 6 inches between the bulb and disk. The samples were then exposed for 90 seconds, 3 minutes, 5 minutes, and 10 minutes, respectively. After specified exposure time, the disks were turned over, and the other side was exposed for the same time interval as the previous side. Disks were placed in a 10 mL nutrient broth and incubated at 30°C for 48 hours. Lastly, the serially diluted specimens were plated onto nutrient agar, incubated for 48 hours, and the log(10) colony forming units (CFU) reductions were enumerated by comparing disks after decontamination versus untreated controls. RESULTS: The log(10) CFU reduction of B. subtilis spores over all time intervals were significant when compared to controls. The mean reduction of spores on the cotton disks were 2.5 log after 90 seconds, 4 log after 3 minutes, and >6 log for both 5 and 10 minutes with no measurable recovery of spores for the last two exposures. CONCLUSION: The use of targeted UVC was very successful in reducing the B. subtilis spores from a cotton disk within 90 seconds, and the 100% elimination of the spores after 5 minutes. Even though a pandemic virus was not used, the sporicidal efficacy suggests this device could be effective at inactivating SARS-CoV-2. Based upon these findings, a targeted UVC device could be utilized for the decontamination of a single-use respirator needed during times of shortages.

Increased Need for Antimicrobial Stewardship during a COVID-19 Outbreak in New York City,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare personnel (HCP) may be at increased risk for COVID-19, but differences in risk by work activities are poorly defined. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends cohorting hospitalized patients with COVID-19 to reduce in-hospital transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but it is unknown if occupational and non-occupational behaviors differ based on exposure to COVID-19 units. METHODS: We analyzed a subset of HCP from an ongoing CDC-funded SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance study. HCP were recruited from four Atlanta hospitals of different sizes and patient populations. All HCP completed a baseline REDCap survey. We used logistic regression to compare occupational activities and infection prevention practices among HCP stratified by exposure to COVID-19 units: low (0% of shifts), medium (1–49% of shifts) or high (≥50% of shifts). RESULTS: Of 211 HCP enrolled (36% emergency department [ED] providers, 35% inpatient RNs, 17% inpatient MDs/APPs, 7% radiology technicians and 6% respiratory therapists [RTs]), the majority (79%) were female and the median age was 35 years. Nearly half of the inpatient MD/APPs (46%) and RNs (47%) and over two-thirds of the RTs (67%) worked primarily in the ICU. Aerosol generating procedures were common among RNs, MD/APPs, and RTs (26–58% performed ≥1), but rare among ED providers (0–13% performed ≥1). Compared to HCP with low exposure to COVID-19 units, those with medium or high exposure spent a similar proportion of shifts directly at the bedside and were about as likely to practice universal masking. Being able to consistently social distance from co-workers was rare (33%); HCP with high exposure to COVID-19 units were less likely to report social distancing in the workplace compared to those with low exposure; however, this was not significantly different (OR 0.6; 95% CI: 0.3, 1.1). Concerns about personal protective equipment in COVID-19 units were similar across levels of exposure (Table 1). Table 1: Occupational activities and infection prevention behaviors of healthcare personnel stratified by level of exposure to COVID-19 units [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The proportion of time spent in dedicated COVID-19 units did not appear to influence time HCP spend directly at the bedside or infection prevention practices (social distancing and universal masking) in the workplace. Risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCP may depend more on factors acting at the individual level rather than those related to location of work.

44112,72. Remdesivir vs Standard Care in Patients with Moderate covid-19,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a significant impact on the work force in hospital settings. Despite rigorous screening practices implemented at many institutions, reports have documented transmission from asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals in community environments. Evidence of nosocomial transmission between healthcare workers and patients in the early phase of the pandemic has further compounded the fears of safety in the workplace. We sought to determine the asymptomatic carriage rate of employees to inform messaging and response in the context of universal masking and eye protection. METHODS: We conducted a period prevalence study in asymptomatic hospital employees at a quaternary pediatric hospital during April to June 2020. Eligible employees included clinical staff, administrative staff, food services workers, and environmental services workers who had passed the temperature and symptom screening evaluation on entry to the campus. Samples were obtained from both nares of consenting individuals and ran daily on a validated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform. RESULTS: A total of 1394 employees consented to participate by June 15, 2020 and none of them had a positive result for COVID-19. Thus, the prevalence rate among asymptomatic employees was zero during this period (95%CI 0%-0.26%). Thirteen employees developed symptoms after initial enrollment and testing of which 1 tested positive for COVID-19. Based on these data, we estimate a monthly incidence rate of 0.8 new COVID-19 cases per 1000 asymptomatic employees (95%CI 0.2 - 4.4 per 1000). Of note, at the time of submission the R(0) for our region was 1.4, and the prevalence of COVID-19 infection among symptomatic employees was 9.9% (68/686 tested in our system, 95%CI: 7.8%-12.3%). CONCLUSION: We did not identify any COVID-19-positive asymptomatic hospital employees who passed screening measures. This suggests very low risk of nosocomial transmission to other employees, patients, and families. Along with low community prevalence and capture of COVID-19-positive symptomatic employees, we could confidently advise staff that universal surgical masking and eye protection were likely adequate to prevent significant exposure.

44113,472. The Utility of Infectious Diseases E-consults in the Era of COVID-19,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Individual States of the USA have ethnic, economic, community health and education differences that influence the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 infection. We hypothesized that Statewide differences in the prevalence and fatality rates of COVID-19 infections are dependent on factors that may be determined by mathematical modeling. METHODS: Two separate statistical regression models were developed using COVID-19 case prevalence and case fatality rates functioning as dependent variables. We obtained data from the prevalence and deaths from COVID-19 cases for each state in the USA that was posted at 4 PM Central Standard Time on April 29, 2020 from the Worldometer website. Publicly available databases were utilized to obtain data for the independent variables in the model. RESULTS: Models are represented as follows: Statewide COVID-19 Prevalence Model Log (Statewide COVID_19 case prevalence) = 1.847* (100–250 individuals/mile2) +3.0025*(250+ individuals/mile2) + 1.021* (% African American population) +1.029* (% Hispanic American population +2.164 *(% adults aged 85+) Model results are shown in Table 1. Statewide COVID-19 Case Fatality Rate Model Log (Statewide COVID_19 case fatality rate) =2.194* (100–250 individuals/mile2) +2.758* (250+ individuals/mile2) +1.031* (% African American population) + 1.032* (% Hispanic American population) + 0.942 (% Native American population)+ 1.108 (% Asian American population) + 2.275 (% adults aged 85+) Model results are shown in Table 2. Table 1: COVID-19 Statewide Prevalence Model [Image: see text] Table 2: COVID-19 Statewide Case Fatality Model [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Higher State population density (See Figure 1 and Figure 2) and higher State populations of elderly persons correspond to increased prevalence and case-fatality rates of COVID-19 infections. Statewide data also shows health disparities for COVID-19 infections in Hispanic Americans, African Americans, and Asian Americans. Paradoxically, States with larger populations of Native Americans who have known poor outcomes from COVID-19 infection demonstrate a decrease in case-fatality rates, suggesting a large effect of healthcare inequality in this population.

44117,95. CAUTI and CLABSI in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Mathematical models can provide insights on the spread of infectious diseases, such as the novel SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). This work applied a SEIR epidemiological compartmental model (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered) with k phases to predict the actual spread of the COVID-19 virus. Fig. 1 – SEIR model for COVID-19. [Image: see text] METHODS: Four parameters of the SEIR model were obtained by international experiences: the incubation period = 3.7 in days, the proportion of critical cases = 0.05, the overall case-fatality rate = 0.023, and the asymptomatic proportion of COVID-19 = 0.18. The critical step in the prediction of COVID-19 by the model is the value of R0 (the basic reproduction number) and T_infectious (the infectious period, in days). R0 and T_infectious for each phase of the curve are calculated by mathematical constrained optimization, a numerical method. Differently from a statistical modelling, a numerical method is a type of mathematical modelling that is not dependent on a probability distribution. The objective function that measures the model error is minimized with respect to R0 and T_infectious in the presence of constraints on those variables. For R0, constraints are valid range of values (0.5 ≤ R0 ≤ 20). For T_infectious, constraints also are related to its range of values (2 ≤ T_infectious ≤ 14). A Solver from Excel or NEOS Server, for example, can be used for finding numerically minimum of a function Z, that represents the sum of absolute value of errors between COVID-19 new cases observed in one day, and COVID-19 cases predicted by the SEIR model (Fig. 2 and 3). Fig. 2 - Mathematical Modeling of COVID-19 transmission by a SEIR model wiht three phases. [Image: see text] Fig.3 - Algorithm for the SEIR model applied to COVID-19 (calculation of new COVID-19 cases day-by-day). [Image: see text] RESULTS: The ECDC has registered 8,142,129 COVID-19 in the world on Jun/17/2020. R0 and T_infectious calculated for a three phases curve in USA, with a stabilized scenario (Fig. 4: R0_1=1.0; T_infectious_1=2; R0_2=17.4; T_infectious_2=2; R0_3=1.0; T_infectious_3=14), a two phases curve in Brazil (Fig. 5: R0_1=8.0; T_infectious_1=9; R0_2=1.3; T_infectious_2=6), and a three phases model for France (Fig. 6: R0_1=4.3; T_infectious_1=11; R0_2=9.3; T_infectious_2=11; R0_3=0.5; T_infectious_3=12).

44122,68. Active Monitoring of a Healthcare Worker Cohort During the COVID-19 Epidemic,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an emerging pathogen that has caused a global pandemic, with New York City as one of its epicenters. Data are still forthcoming if pregnant women are more vulnerable to COVID-19, as they are with influenza. Additionally, it is not known if infants born to COVID-19 positive women are at risk of being infected at birth. METHODS: In March 2020, our hospital instituted a policy of testing all pregnant women presenting for active labor and scheduled C-section or induction of labor, with a nasopharyngeal swab that was sent for RT-PCR qualitative SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche Cobas® 6800). Upon birth, infants were also tested, unless the parent did not give consent. We retrospectively reviewed the COVID-19 test results of all pregnant women and their infants, from March 23 through May 31, 2020 using our infection control surveillance system (VigiLanz®). We also reviewed the electronic medical record (EPIC®) for documentation of any symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection either prior to hospitalization or during the hospital stay. RESULTS: A total of 415 women and 72 infants were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Of the 415 women tested, 41 (9.9%) were positive. Of the 72 infants tested, 2 (2.8%) were positive and concordant with their birth parent. Only 1 (2.4%) of the women who tested positive was symptomatic. The remaining 40 (97.6%) women did not report any symptoms of COVID-19 during labor. Neither of the two positive infants displayed any signs or symptoms of COVID-19. Of the 41 women who were positive, 5 did not consent to have their infant tested. The one symptomatic woman who tested positive for COVID-19 had an infant who tested negative by PCR. CONCLUSION: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, we found 9.9% (41/415) of pregnant women presenting for labor tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among the 41 women who tested positive, only 1 (2.4%) had symptoms on presentation and only 2 newborn infants tested positive. Our data suggests that pregnant women may not be at increased risk for complications from COVID-19 disease and are not likely to transmit the disease to their infants during labor.

44123,"55. Diabetes, Obesity and COVID-19 Disease: An Observational Study of Outcomes Among Hospitalized Patients in Boston, Massachusetts",2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) has been reported in critically ill patients without pre-existing immunocompromising conditions. However, there are scant data on pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of pharmacy records of antifungal use during 3/21-4/22, 2020, and collect longitudinal clinical data. Cases were then classified by the clinical algorithm for IPA in the ICU (AspICU). RESULTS: 7 out of 18 (39%) patients who received antifungal therapy had Aspergillus fumigatus in tracheal aspirate specimens while mechanically ventilated in the ICU. None of the patients had EORTC/MSG host factors. Median time from admission to the date of positive respiratory culture was 9 days (range: 2-15). High-dose glucocorticoids were started a mean of 5.6 days (range 3-8) before the positive respiratory culture in 5 and on the day of the culture in 2. Six received 583-1000 mg equivalent of prednisone. Two received Tocilizumab. By AspICU criteria, 4 had putative IPA. Radiographic abnormalities included cavitary pneumonia, opacities with dense consolidation, worsening infiltrates, and diffuse interstitial and patchy hazy opacities. Compatible signs included worsening respiratory failure in 3 and fever after 3 days of antibacterial agents in 1. Associated findings were leukocytosis in 4, > 1 positive cultures in 3, high procalcitonin in 2, and positive serum galactomannan in 1. The remaining three were classified as colonization as they lacked compatible signs. One had concomitant Klebsiella aerogenes pneumonia with bacteremia, and two later developed Candidemia and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia pneumonia, respectively. All 3 had fever with leukocytosis. One had elevated procalcitonin. Six received antifungal therapy; one did not due to goals of care. All 7 patients expired despite ICU care. CONCLUSION: The critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 in whom respiratory culture grew Aspergillus fumigatus showed very high mortality despite antifungal treatment. By AspICU algorithm, 4 patients had putative IPA. Further data on risk factors and clinical predictors of IPA in COVID-19 are needed.

44129,403. Study of early and late readmissions with COVID-19: A retrospective analysis,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Detailed descriptions of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections and transmission chains in healthcare settings are crucial to controlling outbreaks and improving patient safety. However, such reports are scarce. We sought to determine origins and factors associated with nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a 528-bed teaching hospital in Western New York. METHODS: The index patient, who had mental illness, wandered throughout the ward, would not wear a facemask, and was often kept seated at the nursing station, developed COVID-19 on day- 22 of hospitalization. A case-control approach was used, wherein all patients, staff, and 128 randomly selected environmental surfaces on the outbreak unit (case), and randomly selected patients, staff, and environmental surfaces on designated COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 units (control), were tested for SARS-COV-2 by RT-PCR and IgG SARS-COV-2 antibodies (SAR-Ab). Compliance with hand hygiene (HH) and COVID-specific personal protective equipment (PPE) was assessed. RESULTS: 145 staff and 26 patients were potentially exposed resulting in 25 secondary cases (14 staff and 11 patients). 4/14 (29%) of the staff and 7/11 (64%) of the patients who tested positive, and later became ill, were asymptomatic at the time of testing (Figures 1–2). There was no difference in mean cycle threshold for SARS-COV-2 gene targets between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. 0/32 randomly selected staff from the positive and negative control wards tested positive. PPE compliance based on 354 observations was not significantly different between wards. Environmental surface contamination with SARS-COV-2 RNA was not different between outbreak and control wards. Mean monthly HH compliance, based on 20,146 observations, was lower on the outbreak ward (p < 0.006) (Figure 3). 142 staff volunteered for serologic testing. The proportion staff with detectable SAR-Ab was higher on the outbreak ward (OR 3.78: CI 1.01–14.25). Figure 1 [Image: see text] Figure 2 [Image: see text] Figure 3 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The risk of staff exposure was higher in an outbreak setting than on a dedicated COVID-19 unit (Figure 4). Noncompliant patient behavior, decreased hand hygiene, and pre-symptomatic transmission can contribute to nosocomial spread and are important considerations for ongoing infection control efforts.

44134,467. Spatial-Temporal Prediction Model of COVID-19 Mortality across 62 Counties in New York State,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Transmission of a novel coronavirus (SARS-COV2) from China has caused a global pandemic, resulting in an unprecedented burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Frontline healthcare workers face considerable risk due to the potential for repeated exposure to infected individuals, many of whom may be asymptomatic given the lengthy incubation period of 5–10 days. With rising incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates, appropriate training and support is paramount in safeguarding the wellbeing of NHS staff and patients. Foundation doctors are among frontline staff being redeployed to areas of need. They are a vital resource within the NHS; and are uniquely positioned to support and staff medical teams. METHODS: A 24 question digital survey with a mix of open-ended, multiple-choice, and rating-scale questions was distributed to the 18 UK Foundation Schools. Questions established trainee demographics and the quantity of COVID-19 training received; with focused questions relating to personal safety and support for vulnerable individuals. RESULTS: 714 doctors completed the survey; 55% in FY2, 43% in FY1, and 2% above FY2 level. 74% of respondents reported receiving no formal training on COVID-19. Mean confidence was 84% in diagnosing COVID-19, and 56% in managing it. 75% did not receive formal training on the requisite safety precautions for suspected COVID-19 cases. 67% had not been fit tested and 75% of those who failed their fit test were not provided with alternative equipment. 30 doctors reported being pregnant and none had received additional support regarding protective measures. 47 doctors reported being immunocompromised and 42 of them had received no additional support in view of their increased risk. 93% of doctors had not received definitive guidance regarding the impact of this on their ARCP sign-off and progression of training. CONCLUSION: Alarming proportions of Foundation trainees are not currently being provided with formal training or support for their personal safety during the COVID-19 outbreak. This is remediable through the urgent implementation of formal COVID-19 training, standardised across NHS trusts to ensure a consistent standard of care for the protection of trainees and patients.

Methods: UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS technology was used to analyze the ingredients of PG and the potential LC targets were obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database, and the Analysis Platform (TCMSP), GeneCards and other databases. The interaction network of the drug-disease targets was constructed with the additional use of STRING 11.0. The pathway enrichment analysis was carried out using Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) in Metascape, and then the “Drug-Ingredients-Targets-Pathways-Disease” (D-I-T-P-D) network was constructed using Cytoscape v3.7.1. Finally, the Discovery Studio 2016 (DS) software was used to evaluate the molecular docking. Results: Forty-seven compounds in PG, including triterpenoid saponins, steroidal saponins and flavonoids, were identified and nine main bioactive components including platycodin D were screened. According to the method of data mining, 545 potential drug targets and 2,664 disease-related targets were collected. The results of topological analysis revealed 20 core targets including caspase 3 (CASP3) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) suggesting that the potential signaling pathway potentially involved in the treatment of LC included MAPK signaling pathway and P13K-AKT signaling pathway. The results of molecular docking proved that the bound of the ingredients with potential key targets was excellent. Conclusion: The results in this study provided a novel insight in the exploration of the mechanism of action of PG against LC.","Deng, Yaling; Ye, Xianwen; Chen, Yufan; Ren, Hongmin; Xia, Lanting; Liu, Ying; Liu, Minmin; Liu, Haiping; Zhang, Huangang; Wang, Kairui; Zhang, Jinlian; Zhang, Zhongwei",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7906976/,245

56725,Predictors of Readmission Following Discharge of Patients With Gram-Negative Bacteremia: A Retrospective Cohort Study,2021-07-12,"INTRODUCTION: Respiratory syncytial virus infection is gaining interest in the elderly due to its growing morbidity and mortality. We present a Case of respiratory syncytial virus infection presenting as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that was highly responsive to systemic corticosteroid in an elderly patient. CASE PRESENTATION: An 82-year old man was admitted to the intensive care unit with worsening hypoxic respiratory failure. Chest radiograph showed non-homogeneous air space opacities. Bronchoalveolar lavage showed a finding of alveolar hemorrhage. The diagnosis of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was made and high-dose systemic corticosteroid was given. However, concomitant respiratory syncytial virus infection was later confirmed. Therefore, ribavirin and human immunoglobulin were added. During the course of his treatment, the steroid was stopped and restarted. Interestingly, the clinical course was highly responsive to systemic corticosteroid. CONCLUSION: It appears that diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in this patient may have been due to an immunological process caused by respiratory syncytial virus. Therefore, corticosteroid therapy was highly effective in improving the patient's hemoptysis and hypoxic respiratory failure. We suggest that further studies are required on the use of steroid in this subset of patients with respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infection.","Nam, Kyung Hun; Kang, Junho; Koh, Younsuck",Respir Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8348909/,245

METHODS Seven children aged 7.9 months to 3.7 years with femur fractures treated with the LLCPB at a single institution were retrospectively studied. All children were casted in the emergency department under conscious sedation. Radiographic and subjective outcomes were recorded. RESULTS All 7 children achieved acceptable reduction of their fractures without the need for re-reduction or cast wedging. Five of the 7 children were discharged from the emergency department; 1 child required 1 night of hospitalization and another child required 2 nights of hospitalization. There were no complications. The cost of placing an LLCPB at our institution was $430.46. The cost of placing a spica cast in the operating room was $5427.54 to $6465.00. CONCLUSIONS The long leg cast with a pelvic band seems to be an acceptable treatment for children aged 8 months to 4 years with spiral femur fractures. This technique has significant advantages over traditional and modified spica casts including allowing for uninhibited toileting, weight bearing on the unaffected leg, adjustment of hip flexion at any point after placement, and easier access to the perineum, abdomen, and chest for hygienic and medical purposes. Furthermore, treatment with an LLCPB presents significant potential for cost savings.","Pidgeon, Tyler S; Schiller, Jonathan",Pediatric emergency care,https://doi.org/10.1097/pec.0000000000000508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26414633/,245

It is a real test for all health authorities including Arab countries. In this review, we aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 in the Arab world. In addition, to compare the findings of this study with other top affected countries. METHODOLOGY We searched for official websites from the Ministries of Health and other official sources in all 22 Arab countries. Medline, Science Direct and Google Scholar websites were also used to search for COVID-19, 2019 novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus. The time period was from 1 January 2020 to 31 May 2020. RESULTS As of May 31, 2020, COVID-19 has caused 290,428 confirmed cases, 3,696 deaths and 157,886 cured cases in all Arab countries. In terms of confirmed cases, Saudi Arabia followed by Qatar, UAE, Kuwait and Egypt have the highest reported cases. However, the total number of deaths was dominant in Egypt, followed by Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and UAE. In comparison to other non-Arab countries and confirmed cases, Arab countries come fourth after USA, Brazil and Russia. In terms of death, the Arab world is not listed as the top ten affected countries as only scored eight deaths per million have been recorded. CONCLUSIONS Most Arab countries took some serious early steps to minimize the outbreak of COVID-19. At the moment, controlling the source of infection, the route of transmission and taking care of infected patients are the main challenges for health authorities in all Arab countries.","Alwahaibi, Nasar; Al-Maskari, Muna; Al-Dhahli, Buthaina; Al-Issaei, Halima; Al-Bahlani, Shadia",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.13270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33296334/,245

There is a need to compile and summarize QI availability, feasibility, and global compliance in real-world registries. METHODS AND RESULTS A systematic review of PubMed and Web of Science was conducted including all original articles reporting the use of the ESC QIs in AMI patients. Methods and reporting follow the guidelines of the PRISMA Statement and the protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020190541). Among the 220 screened citations, 9 studies met the inclusion criteria after full-text review. Among these 9 studies, there were 11 different cohorts. Patients were recruited from three different continents (31 countries). The number of QIs assessed ranged from 6 to 20, with 5 studies (56%) reporting data for at least 75% of the 20 QIs. There were room for improvement in terms of data availability (i.e. domain 6 measuring patient's satisfaction), feasibility (i.e. difficulties to find all data for composite QIs in domain 7), and attainment (i.e. high levels of compliance with the percentage of reperfused ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients, but low levels for a timely reperfusion). CONCLUSIONS Our systematic review has shown that it is possible to measure most QIs in existing registries, and that there is room for improvement in terms of data availability, feasibility, and levels of attainment to QIs. Our findings may influence the design of future registries to capture this information and help in QIs definition updates.","Rossello, Xavier; Massó-van Roessel, Albert; Perelló-Bordoy, Antoni; Mas-Lladó, Caterina; Ramis-Barceló, Maria F; Vives-Borrás, Miquel; Pons, Jaume; Peral, Vicente",European heart journal.

Our group has built two versions of a novel aneurysm intrasaccular occlusion device (AIOD) to address the drawbacks associated with current occlusion devices. The objective of the present study was to perform pilot proof of concept in vivo testing of this new AIOD in swine and canines. METHODS Two configurations of the AIOD, termed 'coil-in-shell' and 'gel-in-shell', were implanted in surgically created sidewall aneurysms (n=4) in swine for acute occlusion studies, as well as sidewall (n=8) and bifurcation aneurysms (n=3) in canines to assess long term occlusion efficacy. Occlusion at all time points (immediate, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks) was evaluated by angiography. Neointimal healing at 12 weeks post-implantation in canines was examined histologically. RESULTS Angiographic analysis showed that both the coil-in-shell and gel-in-shell devices achieved complete aneurysm occlusion immediately following device delivery in sidewall aneurysms in swine. In longer term canine studies, initial occlusion ranged from 71.3% to 100%, which was stable with no recurrence in any of the sidewall aneurysms at 6 or 12 weeks. Histological analysis at 12 weeks showed mature fibromuscular tissue at the neck of all aneurysms and no significant inflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS The AIOD tested in this study showed promise in terms of acute and chronic occlusion of aneurysms. Our findings suggest that these devices have the potential to promote robust tissue healing at the aneurysm neck, which may minimize aneurysm recurrence. Although proof of principle has been shown, further work is needed to deliver this device through an endovascular route.","Moftakhar, Roham; Xu, Fangmin; Aagaard-Kienitz, Beverly; Consigny, Daniel W; Grinde, Julie R; Hart, Kevin; Flanagan, Claire E; Crone, Wendy C; Masters, Kristyn S",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24891454/,245

One of the commonly used methods is the inside-out double arm needle technique. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE We have developed a vertical mattress absorbable suture technique. It is easy to perform with a small sized skin incision for knot tying. This technique just necessitates 1 or 2 spinal needles for repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between March 2010 and February 2012, 20 menisci were treated by this technique, a modified method of the outside-in vertical meniscal repair using a spinal needle and No. 2 PDS absorbable suture material. Evaluation of clinical results was done using the Lysholm score. RESULTS The mean preoperative Lysholm score was 63.9 and the mean postoperative score was 97.3.

For treatment, the choice between surgical or endovascular is still debated. The aim of this study was to identify factors that determine the selection of treatment. This study included 307 ALI patients (209 with thrombosis). Patient details, factors affecting the procedure choice, and outcomes were analyzed. The majority of patients were operated on (52.4%). Surgery was more frequent in embolic patients with embolus (odds ratio (OR) 33.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.22-184.19, p < 0.0001), severe ischemia (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.2-2.66, p = 0.0041), and active cancer (OR 4.99; 95% CI 1.26-19.72, p = 0.02). Tibial arteries involvement was negatively related to surgery (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.06-0.95, p = 0.04). The complications and amputation rates were comparable. Reinterventions were more common in the endovascular group (19 (20.2%) vs. 17 (8.9%), p = 0.007). The six-month mortality was higher in the operated patients (12.6% vs. 3.2%, respectively, p = 0.001). The determinants of the treatment path are ischemia severity, concurrent cancer, embolus, and peripheral lesion location.

Controversy in this conundrum stems from the scarcity of ontogenetic data from extant lobe-finned fishes. We report the patterning of an autopod-like domain by hoxa13 during fin development of the Australian lungfish, the most closely related extant fish relative of tetrapods. Differences from tetrapod limbs include the absence of digit-specific expansion of hoxd13 and hand2 and distal limitation of alx4 and pax9, which potentially evolved through an enhanced response to shh signaling in limbs. These developmental patterns indicate that the digit program originated in postaxial fin radials and later expanded anteriorly inside of a preexisting autopod-like domain during the evolution of limbs. Our findings provide a genetic framework for the transition of fins into limbs that supports the significance of classical models proposing a bending of the tetrapod metapterygial axis.","Woltering, Joost M; Irisarri, Iker; Ericsson, Rolf; Joss, Jean M P; Sordino, Paolo; Meyer, Axel",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abc3510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32875118/,245

108715,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children in the United States.,2020-10-21,"OPINION STATEMENT Femoropopliteal (FP) disease is a common presentation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and a challenging anatomic region for durable treatment. Surgical bypass has historically been the primary therapeutic modality, but has been supplanted in the last decade by endovascular therapy, even with the most complex presentation of disease. Endovascular therapy has the advantage of a more favorable and rapid recovery, while preserving future treatment options. Endovascular management of FP disease, initially with ""Plain Old"" balloon angioplasty (POBA) has yielded over the years to bare metal stents (BMS), and more recently, to technologies seeking to limit BMS use due to difficult-to-treat patterns of in-stent restenosis (ISR). Despite a myriad number of endovascular devices and strategies, the approach to FP intervention lends itself to an algorithmic schema largely predicated on lesion length, severity of calcification, recanalization method, and clinical goals based upon individual patient status. In addition, treatment costs are a growing consideration in device selection. These criteria can be summarized into what we have termed as a ""CADENCE"" approach to treatment, an acronym representing the following factors: Clinical scenario, Anatomy, Device performance specifications, Experience/Ease, Novelty, Cost, and Evidence-base (Fig. 1). While the individual components of the CADENCE strategy are not always hierarchical, they combine to give a framework for reasonable interventional strategies for a given patient presentation and lesion appearance. Since there is a notable lack of prospective data for FP interventions, most notably with regard to direct device comparisons, actual practice is often experiential, and further data to guide optimal patient care are needed.","Rundback, John H; Herman, Kevin Chaim; Patel, Amish",Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11936-015-0400-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26265117/,245

Since then, there have been some regulatory changes, along a decline in antibiotics usage: antibiotics are (supposedly) no longer sold without prescription, generic drugs (supposedly) have to demonstrate bioequivalence, and antibiotic usage has drop, from about 13 defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day, to 7. While these changes may sound encouraging, an analysis show that regulatory changes are incomplete at best, and usage decline may be the consequence of factors such as growing poverty. The assessment of resistance continues to be haphazard, without an organized network of laboratories providing a coherent picture. However, judging from a few nationwide reports, it appears that resistance among some nosocomial pathogens (MRSA, enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) is declining, as it is among pneumococci and enteropathogens; but it is rising among community-acquired, uropathogenic Escherichia coli. Resistance to colistin is slowly increasing; and worrisome resistance determinants, such as blaNDM-1 and mcr-1, appeared in Mexico shortly after their first report elsewhere. After four years from the United Nations General Assembly high-level meeting on antibiotic resistance, Mexico is yet to deploy the basic measures to assess and control antibiotic resistance.

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted in the gynecological EDs of Modena (Emilia-Romagna), Sassari and Cagliari (Sardinia) regarding all admissions to gynecological EDs during November 1 to 30, 2019, and March 11 to April 9, 2020 (lockdown period). RESULTS A total of 691 women (mean age 38.3±14.3 years) who were admitted to the gynecological EDs were included. The relative decrease in women evaluated from March 11 to April 9, 2020, was -56.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 52.2-61.1). Time spent in the ED was also significantly shorter during this period (P=0.02) in comparison to November 1 to 30, 2019. The most evident decrease was observed for pelvic pain (-68.9% [95% CI 60.3-76.7]; -91 cases). The management of women suggests a more effective use of the ED, with higher rates of hospitalization (P=0.001) and recourse to emergent surgeries (P=0.005) and lower rates of discharge to home (P=0.03). CONCLUSION The COVID-19 lockdown greatly reduced the rate of admission to gynecological EDs, but the real emergencies were filtered from the more deferrable ones.","Grandi, Giovanni; Del Savio, Maria C; Caroli, Martina; Capobianco, Giampiero; Dessole, Francesco; Tupponi, Giulio; Petrillo, Marco; Succu, Claudia; Paoletti, Anna M; Facchinetti, Fabio",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602939/,245

These viruses differ based on sequence analysis of the capsid gene. Poults were inoculated at 2 days of age and examined during 14 days for clinical signs and virus shedding. All inoculated poults presented signs of enteric disease including diarrhoea and growth depression. Virus presence and shedding was detected by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from intestinal contents and cloacal swabs collected at 3, 7 and 14 days post-inoculation. Viraemia was also confirmed by this method. Common lesions observed at necropsy were dehydration; distended intestines filled with watery contents and undigested feed, and dilated caeca with foamy contents. Microscopic lesions present in the intestines consisted of mild crypt hyperplasia, villous atrophy and lymphocytic infiltration, and were most common in the jejunum. Presence of the viruses was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and by in situ hybridization in both villi and crypt enterocytes in the jejunum and, less frequently, the duodenum, ileum and caeca. Mild lesions consisting mainly of lymphocytic infiltration were also observed in other organs including the pancreas, liver, spleen and kidneys. Mild to moderate bursal atrophy occurred in all TAstV-2-infected poults examined; however, no specific viral staining was observed in this organ or any other tissues examined apart from the intestines. In conclusion, TAstV-2 viruses with variant capsids produce a similar enteric disease in young turkeys and may also affect the immune system of the birds by causing bursal lymphoid depletion.","Pantin-Jackwood, Mary J; Spackman, Erica; Day, J Michael",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079450801932200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18393099/,245

The successful development of biosensor to achieve an efficient detection of glioma cells at low concentration remains a great challenge for the personalized glioma therapy. Herein, an ultrasensitive pulse induced electrochemically impedimetric biosensor for glioma cells detection has been successfully fabricated. The 4-11 nm sulfur-doped graphene quantum dots (S-GQDs) are homogeneously deposited onto gold nanoparticles decorated carbon nanospheres (Au-CNS) by Au-thiol linkage to form S-GQDs@Au-CNS nanocomposite which acts as dual functional probe for enhancing the electrochemical activity as well as conjugating the angiopep-2 (Ang-2) for glioma cell detection. Moreover, the application of an externally electrical pulse at +0.6 V expend the surface of glioma cells to accelerate the attachment of glioma cells onto the Ang-2-conjugated S-GQDs@Au-CNS nanocomposite, resulting in the enhanced sensitivity toward glioma cell detection. An ultrasensitive impedimetric detection of glioma cells with a wide linear range of 100-100,000 cells mL-1 and a limit of detection of 40 cells mL-1 is observed. Moreover, the superior selectivity with long-term stability of the developed biosensor in human serum matrix corroborates the feasibility of using S-GQDs@Au-CNS based nanomaterials as the promising sensing probe for practical application to facilitate the ultrasensitive and highly selective detection of cancer cells.","Ganganboina, Akhilesh Babu; Dega, Naresh Kumar; Tran, Hai Linh; Darmonto, Win; Doong, Ruey-An",Biosensors & bioelectronics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.113151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740543/,245

In particular, the role of transmembrane regions, if any, in target recognition remains an open question. Here, we describe how Ssh4, a yeast E3 ligase adaptor, recognizes the PQ-loop lysine transporter Ypq1 only after lysine starvation. We show evidence of an interaction between two transmembrane helices of Ypq1 (TM5 and TM7) and the single transmembrane helix of Ssh4. This interaction is regulated by the conserved PQ motif. Strikingly, recent structural studies of the PQ-loop family have suggested that TM5 and TM7 undergo major conformational changes during substrate transport, implying that transport-associated conformational changes may determine the selectivity. These findings thus provide critical information concerning the regulatory mechanism through which transmembrane domains can be specifically recognized in response to changing environmental conditions.","Arines, Felichi Mae; Hamlin, Aaron Jeremy; Yang, Xi; Liu, Yun-Yu Jennifer; Li, Ming",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202001116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33351099/,245

The impact of the virus has worsened the difficulties already confronting residents of the fast-growing cities of the developing world already suffering from many challenges, such as inadequate housing, growing poverty, poor urban environmental management, and high levels of unemployment and underemployment. As authorities introduced restrictive measures to curb the spread of the virus, the low-income people appear to be affected by the measures more than the high-income groups. One of the interventions municipal and national leaders have introduced are limitations to movements, commonly known as lock downs. Together with these lock downs has been closures of spaces where low-income vendors and other informal traders operate. How are low-income urban residents being affected by these restrictive measures? Using field observations, newspaper reports and interviews with traders as well as key informants the article examines the changing typology of informal trade under the lockdown conditions. A key finding of the study is that under a restricted trading environment, the means for carrying bulky stock and a quick get-away is giving advantage to traders on wheels. Bringing wares to sites and traveling back home now requires own transport. The well-to-do traders are replacing poor vendors. © 2021 The Author(s).

Strategies that reduce enhanced permeability and vascular inflammation are promising therapeutic targets. Activation of the Angiopoietin-1 (Angpt1)-Tie2 tyrosine kinase signaling pathway is an important regulator of vascular quiescence. Here we describe the design and construction of a new soluble ANGPT1 mimetic that is a potent activator of endothelial Tie2 in vitro and in vivo. Using a chimeric fusion strategy, we replaced the extracellular matrix (ECM) binding and oligomerization domain of ANGPT1 with a heptameric scaffold derived from the C-terminus of serum complement protein C4-binding protein α (C4BP). We refer to this new fusion protein biologic as C4BP-ANG1, which forms a stable heptamer and induces TIE2 phosphorylation in cultured cells, and in the lung following i.v. injection of mice. Injection of C4BP-ANG1 ameliorates VEGF- and lipopolysaccharide-induced vascular leakage, in keeping with the known functions of Angpt1-Tie2 in maintaining quiescent vascular stability, and therefore is a promising candidate treatment for inflammatory endothelial dysfunction.","Liu, Pan; Ryczko, Michael; Xie, Xinfang; Taiyab, Aftab; Sheardown, Heather; Quaggin, Susan E.; Jin, Jing",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.016147,245

Vitamin D may play an important role in inhibiting inflammatory cytokines. Vitamin D deficiency is related to several lung problems, including respiratory distress syndrome, alveolar inflammation, epithelial damage, and hypoxia. Few studies have evaluated the benefits of vitamin D in preventing inflammation in alveolar cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS We developed a cell inflammation model induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. The effects of vitamin D on LPS-induced inflammation in A549 cells were examined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and the anti-inflammatory mechanism of vitamin D was evaluated using western blot analysis. RESULTS Our results indicated that vitamin D promoted A549 cell survival following LPS-induced inflammation by downregulating nuclear factor nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-6, and IL-12.

201461,Reply to Alizazgar J. Dangers of the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination in COVID-19 patients,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak that began in 2019 and spread rapidly across the globe has been observed to cause acute lung injury and multiorgan system failure. While common symptoms are flu-like, this population has been observed to decompensate at an alarmingly rapid rate to severe hypoxia. SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by targeting the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is present on endothelial cells in the lung, heart, kidney, and gastrointestinal tissue. The pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in SARS-CoV-2 infection has a component of lung perfusion dysregulation and is described as a ""cytokine storm"" that causes increased vascular permeability and disease severity. Older adults and those with comorbid conditions, particularly hypertension, diabetes, and history of ischemic heart disease, are especially vulnerable. These high-risk populations are often on angiotensin-modulating therapies, which are theorized to increase ACE2 expressivity, but current evidence for or against discontinuation is equivocal. The standard for SARS-CoV-2 testing is through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, which has presented problems due to low sensitivity and possible co-infection with other pathogens. Treatment for ARDS in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 should follow pre-established goals of care and the wishes of the patient and family members or caregivers and consider the high risk for polypharmacy, cognitive decline, malnutrition, and depression, particularly in older adults. Treatment recommendations have outlined ventilation goals to minimize further lung injury. Compassionate use of pharmacologic therapies such as remdesivir has shown promise, and further clinical trials of anticytokine agents are underway.","Cai, Alice; McClafferty, Brendan; Benson, Jamal; Ramgobin, Devyani; Kalayanamitra, Ricci; Shahid, Zainab; Groff, Andrew; Aggarwal, Chander Shekher; Patel, Ravi; Polimera, Hyma; Vunnam, Ramarao; Golamari, Reshma; Sahu, Nitasa; Bhatt, Dhirisha; Jain, Rohit",South Dakota medicine : the journal of the South Dakota State Medical Association,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32580257/,245

204885,Thymosin alpha 1 (Talpha1) reduces the mortality of severe COVID-19 by restoration of lymphocytopenia and reversion of exhausted T cells,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 threatens health systems worldwide, but Venezuela's system is particularly vulnerable. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, individuals must adopt preventive behaviors. However, to encourage behavior change, we must first understand current knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) that inform response to this health threat. METHODS: We explored KAPs among Venezuelans using a cross-sectional, internet-based questionnaire. The questionnaire explored individuals' knowledge about COVID-19; their attitudes toward the world's and the Venezuelan authorities' abilities to control it; and their self-reported practices. We also collected demographic data. Binomial logistic regression analyses were used to predict the adoption of preventive behaviors based on demographic variables, individual knowledge level, and individual attitudes. RESULTS: 3122 individuals completed the questionnaire. Participants had a high level of knowledge about COVID-19. They expressed high levels of optimism that the world would eventually control COVID-19, but they were very pessimistic about the public authorities in Venezuela. Most participants adopted preventive practices. Binomial regression suggests younger people, less educated people, and manual laborers hold lower levels of knowledge, and these groups, as well as men, were less likely to adopt preventive practices. Knowledge, by itself, had no association with optimism and little association with self-reported practices. CONCLUSIONS: As other KAP studies in Latin America found, knowledge is not sufficient to prompt behavior change. Venezuelans' pessimism about their own country's ability should be explored in greater depth. Health promotion in Venezuela may wish to target the most at risk groups: men, younger people, less educated people, and manual laborers.","Bates, Benjamin R; Tami, Adriana; Carvajal, Ana; Grijalva, Mario J",PLoS One,,245

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR were retrospectively analysed. Clinical data, the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and imaging features were recorded. Lung features included ground-glass opacities (GGO), areas of consolidation and crazy paving patterns. The COVID19-LDCT score was calculated by summing the score of each segment from 0 (no involvement) to 10 (severe impairment). Univariate analysis was performed to explore predictive factor of high COVID19-LDCT score. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used to compare groups and a Spearman correlation used with p<0.05 for significance. RESULTS: Eighty patients with positive RT-PCR were analysed. The mean age was 55 years ± 16, with 42 males (53%). The most frequent symptoms were fever (60/80, 75%) and cough (59/80, 74%), the mean NEWS was 1.7±2.3. All LDCT could be analysed and 23/80 (28%) were normal. The major imaging finding was GGOs in 56 cases (67%). The COVID19-LDCT score (mean value = 19±29) was correlated with NEWS (r = 0.48, p<0.0001). No symptoms were risk factor to have pulmonary involvement. Univariate analysis shown that dyspnea, high respiratory rate, hypertension and diabetes are associated to a COVID19-LDCT score superior to 50. CONCLUSIONS: COVID19-LDCT score did correlate with NEWS. It was significantly different in the clinical low-risk and high-risk groups.

209197,A national consensus management pathway for paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 (PIMS-TS): results of a national Delphi process,2020,"Galactic nuclei are promising sites for stellar origin black hole (BH) mergers, as part of merger hierarchies in deep potential wells. We show that binary black hole (BBH) merger rates in active galactic nuclei (AGN) should always exceed merger rates in quiescent galactic nuclei (nuclear star clusters, NSCs) around supermassive BHs (SMBHs) without accretion disks. This is primarily due to average binary lifetimes in AGN that are significantly shorter than in NSCs. The lifetime difference comes from rapid hardening of BBHs in AGN, such that their semi-major axes are smaller than the hard-soft boundary of their parent NSC; this contrasts with the large average lifetime to merger for BBHs in NSCs around SMBHs, due to binary ionization mechanisms. Secondarily, merger rates in AGNs are enhanced by gas-driven binary formation mechanisms. Formation of new BHs in AGN disks are a minor contributor to the rate differences. With the gravitational wave detection of several BBHs with at least one progenitor in the upper mass gap, and signatures of dynamical formation channels in the $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution, we argue that AGN could contribute $\sim 25\%-80\%$ of the LIGO-Virgo measured rate of $\sim 24 \rm{Gpc}^{-3} \rm{yr}^{-1}$.","Ford, K.

214894,The COVID-19 outbreak: The issue of face masks,2020,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Severe asthma management during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenge and will continue to be, at least in the next few months, as herd immunity is still a mirage. A lot has to be learned about how COVID-19 affects underlying diseases, and severe asthma is no exception. METHODS: Narrative review of papers available until February 2021 in PubMed and Google Scholar, relating severe asthma and COVID-19. Four main research topics were reviewed: SARS-CoV-2 infection: immunology and respiratory pathology; interrelationship of severe asthma endotypes and COVID-19 disease mechanisms; severe asthma epidemiology and COVID-19; and biologics for severe asthma in the context of COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 disease mechanisms start with upper respiratory cell infection, and afterwards several immunological facets are activated, contributing to disease severity, namely cell-mediated immunity and antibody production. Although infrequent in the COVID-19 course some patients develop a cytokine storm that causes organ damage and may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome or multiorgan failure. Regarding severe asthma endotypes, type2-high might have a protective role both in infection risk and disease course. There is conflicting data regarding the epidemiological relationship between COVID-19 among severe asthma patients, with some studies reporting increased risk of infection and disease course, whereas others the other way round. Biologics for severe asthma do not seem to increase the risk of infection and severe COVID-19, although further evidence is needed.

Data sources: Medline, Embase, Cinahl and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched electronically utilizing combinations of word variants for ""coronavirus"" or ""severe acute respiratory syndrome"" or ""SARS"" or ""Middle East respiratory syndrome"" or ""MERS"" or ""COVID-19"" and ""pregnancy"". The search and selection criteria were restricted to English language. Study eligibility criteria: Inclusion criteria were pregnant women with a confirmed Coronavirus related illness, defined as either SARS, MERS or COVID-19. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: We used meta-analyses of proportions to combine data and reported pooled proportions. The pregnancy outcomes observed included miscarriage, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, fetal growth restriction, and mode of delivery. The perinatal outcomes observed were fetal distress, Apgar score < 7 at five minutes, neonatal asphyxia, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, perinatal death, and evidence of vertical transmission. Results: 19 studies including 79 women were eligible for this systematic review: 41 pregnancies (51.9%) affected by COVID-19, 12 (15.2%) by MERS, and 26 (32.9%) by SARS. An overt diagnosis of pneumonia was made in 91.8% and the most common symptoms were fever (82.6%), cough (57.1%) and dyspnea (27.0%). For all CoV infections, the rate of miscarriage was 39.1% (95% CI 20.2-59.8); the rate of preterm birth < 37 weeks was 24.3% (95% CI 12.5-38.6); premature prelabor rupture of membranes occurred in 20.7% (95% CI 9.5-34.9), preeclampsia in 16.2% (95% CI 4.2-34.1), and fetal growth restriction in 11.7% (95% CI 3.2-24.4); 84% were delivered by cesarean; the rate of perinatal death was 11.1% (95% CI 84.8-19.6) and 57.2% (95% CI 3.6-99.8) of newborns were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. When focusing on COVID-19, the most common adverse pregnancy outcome was preterm birth < 37 weeks, occurring in 41.1% (95% CI 25.6-57.6) of cases, while the rate of perinatal death was 7.0% (95% CI 1.4-16.3). None of the 41 newborns assessed showed clinical signs of vertical transmission. Conclusion: In mothers infected with coronavirus infections, including COVID-19, >90% of whom also had pneumonia, PTB is the most common adverse pregnancy outcome. Miscarriage, preeclampsia, cesarean, and perinatal death (7-11%) were also more common than in the general population. There have been no published cases of clinical evidence of vertical transmission. Evidence is accumulating rapidly, so these data may need to be updated soon. The findings from this study can guide and enhance prenatal counseling of women with COVID-19 infection occurring during pregnancy.","Di Mascio, Daniele; Khalil, Asma; Saccone, Gabriele; Rizzo, Giuseppe; Buca, Danilo; Liberati, Marco; Vecchiet, Jacopo; Nappi, Luigi; Scambia, Giovanni; Berghella, Vincenzo; D039,; Antonio, Francesco",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,,245

To diagnose promptly and accurately is the vital step to effectively control its pandemic. Dynamic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies which are important for diagnosis of infection have not been fully demonstrated. In this retrospective, single-center, observational study, we enrolled the initial 131 confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Jin-Yin-Tan Hospital who had at least one-time antibody tested during their hospitalization. The dynamic changes of IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in 226 serum samples were detected by ELISA. The sensitivities of IgM and IgG ELISA detection were analyzed. Result showed that the sensitivity of the IgG ELISA detection (92.5%) was significantly higher than that of the IgM (70.8%) (P < 0.001). The meantimes of seroconversion for IgM and IgG were 6 days and 3 days, respectively. The IgM and IgG antibody levels peaked at around 18 days and 23 days, and then IgM fell to below the baseline level at about day 36, whereas IgG maintained at a relatively high level. In conclusion, antibodies should be detected to aid in diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. IgG could be a sensitive indicator for retrospective diagnosis and contact tracing, while IgM could be an indicator of early infection.","Shu, Huaqing; Wang, Shuzhen; Ruan, Shunan; Wang, Yaxin; Zhang, Jiancheng; Yuan, Yin; Liu, Hong; Wu, Yongran; Li, Ruiting; Pan, Shangwen; Ouyang, Yaqi; Yuan, Shiying; Zhou, Peng; Shang, You",Virol. sin.

219069,"Hospital infection and COVID-19: Do not put all your eggs on the ""swab"" tests",2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the global health emergency. Here, we explore the diverse mechanisms of SARS-CoV-induced inflammation. We presume that SARS-CoV-2 likely contributes analogous inflammatory responses. Possible therapeutic mechanisms for reducing SARS-CoV-2-mediated inflammatory responses comprise FcR inactivation. Currently, there is no specific remedy available against the SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, recognizing efficacious antiviral leads to combat the virus is crucially desired. The coronavirus (CoV) main protease (Mpro also called 3CLpro), which plays an indispensable role in viral replication and transcription, is an interesting target for drug design. This review compiles the latest advances in biological and structural research, along with development of inhibitors targeting CoV Mpros. It is anticipated that inhibitors targeting CoV Mpros could be advanced into wide-spectrum antiviral drugs in case of COVID-19 and other CoV-related diseases. The crystal structural and docking results have shown that Ebselen, N3, TDZD-8 and &#945;-ketoamide (13b) inhibitors can bind to the substrate-binding pocket of COVID-19 Mpro. &#945;-ketoamide-based inhibitor 13b inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human Calu3 lung cells. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that the treatment with Ebselen, TDZD-8 and N3 reduced the amounts of SARS-CoV-2, respectively, 20.3-, 10.19- and 8.4-fold compared to the treatment in the absence of inhibitor. Moreover, repurposing of already present drugs to treat COVID-19 serves as one of the competent and economic therapeutic strategies. Several anti-malarial, anti-HIV and anti-inflammatory drugs as mentioned in Table 2 were found effective for the COVID-19 treatment. Further, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was found more potent than chloroquine (CQ) in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Furthermore, convalescent plasma from patients who have recuperated from viral infections can be employed as a therapy without the appearance of severe adverse events. Hence, it might be valuable to examine the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma transfusion in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.","Tripathi, Neetu; Tripathi, Neeraj; Goshisht, Manoj Kumar",Mol. divers,,245

Aim: To present a rare case of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Adult (MIS-A). Case Report: The patient presented with 5 days of fever, profuse sweating, vomiting and loose stools. Patient was otherwise healthy with no prior medical illness and was never a diagnosed case of COVID 19. At the time of admission, patient was found to be in shock with leukocytosis, conjunctivitis, acute kidney injury, cardiac dysfunction, acute hepatitis with both COVID antigen and RTPCR negative. The patient required ICU admission with ventilatory and vasopressor support. MIS-A secondary to COVID19 was suspected on the basis of his clinical presentation and a positive COVID Antibody report. Patient improved clinically with IV steroids, IVIG, heparin, and Critical Care management and support. Conclusion: A small portion of patients present with late onset complications following asymptomatic COVID 19 infection. This Stage includes Multiorgan dysfunction in the setting of severe inflammation. MIS-C has become a recognized syndrome whereas a parallel syndrome in adults has not been well defined. So MIS-A should be considered in adults presenting with features compatible with MIS-C like illness, including shock and cardiac dysfunction.Y","Baruah, R.; Gupta, R.",Annals of Medical and Health Sciences Research,,245

219795,The effects of arrival quarantine on subsequent COVID-19 testing in a cohort of military basic trainees,2020,"In this paper, an SIR model with spatial dependence is studied, and results regarding its stability and numerical approximation are presented. SIR models have been used to describe epidemic propagation phenomena, and one of the first models is derived by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927. In such models, the population is spit into three classes: $S$ being the group of healthy individuals, who are susceptible to infection; $I$ is the compartment of the ill species, which can infect other individuals; and $R$ being the class in which recovered species are. We consider a generalization of the original Kermack and McKendrick model in which the size of the populations differs in space. The use of local spatial dependence yields a system of integro-differential equations. The uniqueness and qualitatively properties of the continuous model are analyzed. Furthermore, different choices of spatial and temporal discretizations are deployed, and step-size restrictions for population conservation, positivity and monotonicity preservation of the discrete model are investigated. We provide sufficient conditions under which high order numerical schemes preserve the discrete properties of the model. Computational experiments verify the convergence and accuracy of the numerical methods.","Tak'acs, B'alint; Hadjimichael, Yiannis",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01330v1.pdf,245

Once the virus entered the prisons, key actions and inaction by Michigan Department of Corrections and Governor Gretchen Whitmer allowed COVID-19 to flourish unabated, resulting in unnecessary infection and death;a form of cruel and unusual punishment. The callous neglect of the human rights of prisoners during the pandemic is not new, but rather the result of decades of punitive sentencing policies that disproportionately target people of colour. Through a case study examination of early coronavirus outbreaks in Michigan prisons, this paper will consider how Truth in Sentencing legislation, increasingly long prison sentences and declining parole rates, helped set the stage for coronavirus to spread, disproportionately harming Black and elderly prisoners.

To gain insight into how the viral spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) might evolve in response to common antibody responses, we studied mutations occurring during virus evolution in a persistently infected immunocompromised individual. We use antibody Fab/RBD structures to predict, and pseudotypes to confirm, that mutations found in late-stage evolved S variants confer resistance to a common class of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies we isolated from a healthy COVID-19 convalescent donor. Resistance extends to the polyclonal serum immunoglobulins of four out of four healthy convalescent donors we tested and to monoclonal antibodies in clinical use. We further show that affinity maturation is unimportant for wild-type virus neutralization but is critical to neutralization breadth. Because the mutations we studied foreshadowed emerging variants that are now circulating across the globe, our results have implications to the long-term efficacy of S-directed countermeasures.","Clark, Sarah A; Clark, Lars E; Pan, Junhua; Coscia, Adrian; McKay, Lindsay G A; Shankar, Sundaresh; Johnson, Rebecca I; Brusic, Vesna; Choudhary, Manish C; Regan, James; Li, Jonathan Z; Griffiths, Anthony; Abraham, Jonathan",Cell,,245

223703,The Role of Procalcitonin in Antibiotic Decision-Making in Covid-19 Infection,2021,"BACKGROUND: Although guidelines recommend systemic therapy even in patients with limited extrahepatic metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a few recent studies suggested a potential benefit for resection of extrahepatic metastases. However, the benefit of adrenal resection (AR) for adrenal-only metastases (AOM) from HCC was not proved yet. This is the first study to compare long-term outcomes of AR to those of sorafenib in patients with AOM from HCC. METHODS: The patients with adrenal metastases (AM) from HCC were identified from the electronic records of the institution between January 2002 and December 2018. Those who presented AM and other sites of extrahepatic disease were excluded. Furthermore, the patients with AOM who received other therapies than AR or sorafenib were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 34 patients with AM from HCC were treated. Out of these, 22 patients had AOM, 6 receiving other treatment than AR or sorafenib. Eventually, 8 patients with AOM underwent AR (AR group), while 8 patients were treated with sorafenib (SOR group). The baseline characteristics of the two groups were not significantly different in terms of age, sex, number and size of the primary tumor, timing of AM diagnosis, Child-Pugh and ECOG status. After a median follow-up of 15.5 months, in the AR group, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates (85.7%, 42.9%, and 0%, respectively) were significantly higher than those achieved in the SOR group (62.5%, 0% and 0% at 1-, 3- and 5-year, respectively) (P = 0.009). The median progression-free survival after AR (14 months) was significantly longer than that after sorafenib therapy (6 months, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AOM from HCC, AR was associated with significantly higher overall and progression-free survival rates than systemic therapy with sorafenib. These results could represent a starting-point for future phase II/III clinical trials.","Alexandrescu, Sorin T; Croitoru, Adina E; Grigorie, Razvan T; Tomescu, Dana R; Droc, Gabriela; Grasu, Mugur C; Popescu, Irinel",Hepatobiliary pancreat. dis. int,,245

We identified a phenotype in individuals with extremely high viral load who could act as super-spreaders. METHODS: Data were analyzed from individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 18 through August 15, 2020. Outcomes were compared using contingency table and quantile regression to test the equality of medians between the pandemic waves and by viral load groups. RESULTS: Of the 11,564 samples tested, 1,319 (11.4%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. An increase in weekly median viral load occurred in the second wave of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. This population was more likely to be women, outpatients, symptomatic and have an extremely high or high viral load. In patients with multiple RT-PCR positive tests, the duration of viral shedding was comparable between individuals with asymptomatic/mild and mild/moderate illness severity. CONCLUSIONS: We detected a small group of individuals with extremely high SARS-CoV-2 viral load with mild illness.

226684,"Correlation between Chest CT Findings and Clinical Features of 211 COVID-19 Suspected Patients in Wuhan, China",2020,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to study interreader agreement of the RSNA-STR-ACR (Radiological Society of North America/Society of Thoracic Radiology/American College of Radiology) consensus statement on reporting chest computed tomography (CT) findings related to COVID-19 on a sample of consecutive patients confirmed with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This institutional review board-approved retrospective study included 240 cases with a mean age of 47.6 ± 15.9 years, ranging from 20 to 90 years, who had a chest CT and RT-PCR performed. Computed tomography images were independently analyzed by 2 thoracic radiologists to identify patterns defined by the RSNA-STR-ACR consensus statement, and concordance was determined with weighted &#954; tests. Also, CT findings and CT severity scores were tabulated and compared. RESULTS: Of the 240 cases, 118 had findings on CT. The most frequent on the RT-PCR-positive group were areas of ground-glass opacities (80.5%), crazy-paving pattern (32.2%), and rounded pseudonodular ground-glass opacities (22.9%). Regarding the CT patterns, the most frequent in the RT-PCR-positive group was typical in 75.9%, followed by negative in 17.1%. The interreader agreement was 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.80-0.96) in this group. The CT severity score had a mean difference of -0.07 (95% confidence interval, -0.48 to 0.34) among the readers, showing no significant differences regarding visual estimation. CONCLUSIONS: The RSNA-STR-ACR consensus statement on reporting chest CT patterns for COVID-19 presents a high interreader agreement, with the typical pattern being more frequently associated with RT-PCR-positive examinations.","Silva, Claudio F; Alegria, Julia; Ramos, Cristobal; Verdugo, Jaime; Diaz, Juan-Carlos; Varela, Cristian; Barbe, Mario",J Comput Assist Tomogr,,245
226892,Utility of asymptomatic inpatient testing for COVID-19 in a low-prevalence setting: A multicenter point-prevalence study,2020,"With the spread and development of new epidemics, it is of great reference value to identify the changing trends of epidemics in public emotions. We designed and implemented the COVID-19 public opinion monitoring system based on time series thermal new word mining. A new word structure discovery scheme based on the timing explosion of network topics and a Chinese sentiment analysis method for the COVID-19 public opinion environment is proposed. Establish a""Scrapy-Redis-Bloomfilter""distributed crawler framework to collect data. The system can judge the positive and negative emotions of the reviewer based on the comments, and can also reflect the depth of the seven emotions such as Hopeful, Happy, and Depressed. Finally, we improved the sentiment discriminant model of this system and compared the sentiment discriminant error of COVID-19 related comments with the Jiagu deep learning model. The results show that our model has better generalization ability and smaller discriminant error. We designed a large data visualization screen, which can clearly show the trend of public emotions, the proportion of various emotion categories, keywords, hot topics, etc., and fully and intuitively reflect the development of public opinion.","Zhang, Yixian; Chen, Jieren; Liu, Boyi; Yang, Yifan; Li, Haocheng; Zheng, Xinyi; Chen, Xi; Ren, Tenglong; Xiong, Naixue",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11458v1.pdf,245

A Modified Early Warning Score Predicts Decompensation in COVID-19 Patients,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The COVID-19 epidemic is affecting almost all individuals worldwide, and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnesic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are particularly at risk due to their characteristics and age. We analysed the impact of the pandemic on these patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms and their quality of life after 5 weeks of lockdown in Spain. METHODS: A total of 40 patients with a diagnosis of MCI (n = 20) or mild AD (n = 20) from the Cognitive Stimulation Program of the Cognitive Disorders Unit were evaluated. All patients had undergone a previous evaluation during the month before the lockdown, and were re-evaluated after 5 weeks of lockdown. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and EuroQol-5D questionnaire (EQ-5D) were used to assess neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients and the quality of life in patients as well in caregivers. RESULTS: The mean (SD) total baseline NPI score was 33.75 (22.28), compared with 39.05 (27.96) after confinement (P = 0.028). The most frequently affected neuropsychiatric symptoms were apathy [4.15 (3.78) vs. 5.75 (4.02); P = 0.002] and anxiety [3.95 (3.73) vs. 5.30 (4.01); P = 0.006] in patients with MCI, and apathy [2.35 (2.70) vs. 3.75 (3.78); P = 0.036], agitation [0.45 (1.14) vs. 1.50 (2.66); P = 0.029] and aberrant motor behaviour [1.25 (2.86) vs. 2.00 (2.93); P = 0.044] in patients with AD. We did not observe differences in EQ-5D scores during the re-evaluation. The 30% of patients and 40% of caregivers reported a worsening of the patients' health status during confinement. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show the worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with AD and MCI during 5 weeks of lockdown, with agitation, apathy and aberrant motor activity being the most affected symptoms.","Lara, B; Carnes, A; Dakterzada, F; Benitez, I; Piñol-Ripoll, G",Eur. j. neurol,,245

We describe a case of a 36-year-old coronavirus-positive patient that was admitted on emergency basis; his clinical presentation included neurological symptoms such as drowsiness and mild confusion. Imaging revealed findings consistent with meningoencephalitis complicated by intracerebral hematoma and subdural hematoma. The latter was surgically evacuated after it became chronic and evidence of coronavirus was found in the fluid. Our experience confirms that neurological complications might be a likely event in COVID-19. Although uncommon, the possible occurrence of meningoencephalitis should be kept in mind by physicians involved in the management of COVID-19 patients. Early recognition of brain involvement may provide better prognosis, preventing evolution into intracerebral hemorrhagic events.","Al-Olama, Mohammad; Rashid, Anas; Garozzo, Debora",Acta Neurochir (Wien),,245
230487,"Tocilizumab for the treatment of severe COVID-19: A retrospective, multi-center, case-matched series",2020,"COVID-19 is without any doubt the worst pandemic we have faced since the H1N1 virus outbreak. Even if vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection is becoming increasingly available, a more feasible approach for COVID-19 prevention and therapy is still needed. Evidence of a pathological link between metabolic diseases and severe forms of COVID-19 has stimulated critical reflection and new considerations. In particular, an abnormal immune response observed in certain patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection suggested possible common predisposing risk factors with autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Correct supplementation with dietary factors may be key to preventing and counteracting both the underlying metabolic impairment and the complications of COVID-19. A set of agents may inhibit the cytokine storm and hypercoagulability that characterize severe COVID-19 infection: vitamin D3, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols like pterostilbene, polydatin and honokiol, which can activate anti-inflammatory and antioxidant sirtuins pathways, quercetin, vitamin C, zinc, melatonin, lactoferrin and glutathione. These agents could be highly beneficial for subjects who have altered immune responses. In this review, we discuss the antiviral and metabolic effects of these dietary factors and propose their combination for potential applications in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Rigorous studies will be fundamental for validating preventive and therapeutic protocols that could be of assistance to mitigate disease progression following SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ricordi, Camillo; Pacifici, Francesca; Lanzoni, Giacomo; Palamara, Anna Teresa; Garaci, Enrico; Della-Morte, David",Int. j. mol. sci.

230643,Decreased seasonal influenza during the COVID-19 pandemic in temperate countries,2021,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to characterize changes in the total operative cases logged by general surgery residents across three residency programs. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. De-identified case logs, divided by institution and post graduate year (PGY) level, were obtained from the general surgery training programs at three academic hospitals. Total cases logged were calculated over the pandemic period (start: beginning of residency, end: May 31st, 2020) and the control period (start: beginning of residency, end: May 31st, 2019). SETTING: Three academic tertiary hospitals (Mayo Clinic - Arizona, Mayo Clinic - Florida, and Mayo Clinic - Rochester) PARTICIPANTS: All general surgery residents at these three hospitals, including 25 residents at Mayo Clinic - Arizona in both the pandemic and control period, 16 and 15 residents at Mayo Clinic - Florida in the control and pandemic period, respectively, and 81 and 77 residents at Mayo Clinic - Rochester in the control and pandemic period, respectively. RESULTS: Only PGY 4 general surgery residents at Mayo Clinic - Rochester had a decrease in operative cases logged in the pandemic period (759 cases on average compared to 1010 cases, pâ¯=â¯0.005), with no other changes in operative cases logged noted. CONCLUSIONS: While elective cases were postponed secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic for around 1 month in the spring of 2020, the decrease in elective cases did not greatly impact overall resident operative cases logged for residents in three general surgery residency programs.","Lund, Sarah; Hinduja, Pranav; Stulak, John; Elli, Enrique; Mishra, Nitin; Farres, Houssam; Rivera, Mariela",J. surg. educ,,245

When modeled, persistence in their behavior and reaction to new information suggested to adopt an autoregressive-type framework. The Multiplicative Error Model (MEM) is borne of an extension of the popular GARCH approach for modeling and forecasting conditional volatility of asset returns. It is obtained by multiplicatively combining the conditional expectation of a process (deterministically dependent upon an information set at a previous time period) with a random disturbance representing unpredictable news: MEMs have proved to parsimoniously achieve their task of producing good performing forecasts. In this paper we discuss various aspects of model specification and inference both for the univariate and the multivariate case. The applications are illustrative examples of how the presence of a slow moving low-frequency component can improve the properties of the estimated models.","Cipollini, Fabrizio; Gallo, Giampiero M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.05923v1.pdf,245

Recent evidence points towards modulation of mTOR in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We discuss the current literature on mTOR in SARS-CoV-2 and highlight evidence in support of a role for mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019.","Karam, Basil S; Morris, Rachel S; Bramante, Carolyn T; Puskarich, Michael; Zolfaghari, Emily J; Lotfi-Emran, Sahar; Ingraham, Nicholas E; Charles, Anthony; Odde, David J; Tignanelli, Christopher J",J. med. virol,,245

SARS-CoV-2 elicited an approximately two-fold higher stimulation of the innate immune response compared to SARS-CoV in the human epithelial cell line Calu-3, including induction of miRNA-155. Single-cell RNA sequencing of infected cells showed that genes induced by virus infections were broadly upregulated, whereas interferon beta/lambda genes an pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 were expressed only in small subsets of infected cells. Temporal analysis suggested that transcriptional activities of interferon regulatory factors precede those of nuclear factor &#954;B. Lastly, we identified heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) as a protein relevant for the infection. Inhibition of the HSP90 activity resulted in a reduction of viral replication and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in primary human airway epithelial cells.","Emanuel, Wyler; Kirstin, Mösbauer; Vedran, Franke; Asija, Diag; Theresa, Gottula Lina; Roberto, Arsiè; Filippos, Klironomos; David, Koppstein; Katja, Hönzke; Salah, Ayoub; Christopher, Buccitelli; Karen, Hoffmann; Anja, Richter; Ivano, Legnini; Andranik, Ivanov; Tommaso, Mari; Simone, Del Giudice; Jan, Papies; Samantha, Praktiknjo; Meyer Thomas, F; Alexander, Müller Marcel; Daniela, Niemeyer; Andreas, Hocke; Matthias, Selbach; Altuna, Akalin; Nikolaus, Rajewsky; Christian, Drosten; Markus, Landthaler",iScience,,245

Respiratory Coinfections with COVID-19 in Veterans Health Administration (VA), 2020",2020,"Thrombin, the ligand of the protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), is a well-known stimulator of proangiogenic responses in vascular endothelial cells (ECs), which are mediated through the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, the transcriptional events underlying this thrombin-induced VEGF induction and angiogenic response are less well understood at present. As reported here, we conducted detailed promotor activation and signal transduction pathway studies in human microvascular ECs, to decipher the transcription factors and the intracellular signaling events underlying the thrombin and PAR-1-induced endothelial VEGF induction. We found that c-FOS is a key transcription factor controlling thrombin-induced EC VEGF synthesis and angiogenesis. Upon the binding and internalization of its G-protein-coupled PAR-1 receptor, thrombin triggers ERK1/2 signaling and activation of the nuclear AP-1/c-FOS transcription factor complex, which then leads to VEGF transcription, extracellular secretion, and concomitant proangiogenic responses of ECs. In conclusion, exposure of human microvascular ECs to thrombin triggers signaling through the PAR-1-ERK1/2-AP-1/c-FOS axis to control VEGF gene transcription and VEGF-induced angiogenesis. These observations offer a greater understanding of endothelial responses to thromboinflammation, which may help to interpret the results of clinical trials tackling the conditions associated with endothelial injury and thrombosis.","Catar, Rusan; Moll, Guido; Hosp, Isa; Simon, Michele; Luecht, Christian; Zhao, Hongfan; Wu, Dashan; Chen, Lei; Kamhieh-Milz, Julian; Korybalska, Katarzyna; Zickler, Daniel; Witowski, Janusz",,,245

The current systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to estimate the prevalence and incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) among COVID-19 patients. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis . METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and MedRxiv databases were searched from December 1, 2019, up to July 27, 2020. Two independent co-authors completed the screening process, data extraction, and quality assessment of the retrieved records. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to determine the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) of AKI among COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Out of 2,332 unique identified records, 51 studies were included in the review. Overall, the studies were carried out on 25,600 patients. A total of 6,505 patients (in 18 cross-sectional studies) were included to estimate the pooled prevalence of AKI, and 18,934 patients (in 27 cohort studies) were included to determine the pooled incidence of AKI. The pooled prevalence of AKI was estimated as 10.08% (95% CI: 4.59, 17.32; I2=98.56%; P<0.001). Furthermore, the pooled incidence of AKI was 12.78% (95% CI: 7.38, 19.36; I2=99.27%; P<0.001). The mean (95% CI) values of serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), potassium, and sodium were 76.10 (69.36, 82.84), 4.60 (4.04, 5.30), 3.94 (3.78, 4.11), and 139.30 (138.26, 140.36) mmol/L, respectively. CONCLUSION: The AKI is a considerable complication among COVID-19 patients and should be screened for on clinical examinations.

The consequence of these practices may bode poorly in the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Alternatively, the CDC recommends the use of disposable stethoscopes. However, these instruments have poor acoustic properties, and misdiagnoses have been documented. They may also serve as pathogen vectors among staff sharing them.

247211,First submicroscopic inversion of the OPA1 gene identified in dominant optic atrophy - a case report,2020,"AIMS: Open reduction in developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is regularly performed despite screening programmes, due to failure of treatment or late presentation. A protocol for open reduction of DDH has been refined through collaboration between surgical, anaesthetic, and nursing teams to allow same day discharge. The objective of this study was to determine the safety and feasibility of performing open reduction of DDH as a day case. METHODS: A prospectively collected departmental database was visited. All consecutive surgical cases of DDH between June 2015 and March 2020 were collected. Closed reductions, bilateral cases, cases requiring corrective osteotomy, and children with comorbidities were excluded. Data collected included demographics, safety outcome measures (blood loss, complications, readmission, reduction confirmation), and feasibility for discharge according to the Face Legs Activity Cry Consolidability (FLACC) pain scale. A satisfaction questionnaire was filled by the carers. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis. RESULTS: Out of 168 consecutive DDH cases, 16 patients fit the inclusion criteria (age range 10 to 26 months, 13 female). Intraoperative blood loss ranged from ""minimal"" to 120 ml, and there were no complications or readmissions. The FLACC score was 0 for all patients. The carers satisfaction questionnaire expressed high satisfaction from the experience with adequate information and support provided. CONCLUSION: Open reduction in DDH, without corrective osteotomy, is safe and feasible to be managed as a day case procedure. It requires a clear treatment pathway, analgesia, sufficient counselling, and communication with carers. It is even more important during the COVID-19 pandemic when reduced length of hospital stay is likely to be safer for both patient and their parents.

247490,Body Identity Search: The Suspended Body,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is widely understood to have contributed to mental health problems. In Australia, young people (18-24 years) have been disproportionately affected. To date, research has predominantly focused on the presence or absence of mental illness symptoms, while aspects of mental well-being have been overlooked. We aimed to explore associations between potential risk and protective factors and mental health more comprehensively, using the Complete State Model of Mental Health. An online survey of 1004 young Australians (55% female; M age = 21.23) was undertaken. Assessment of both mental illness and mental well-being enabled participants to be cross-classified into four mental health states. Those with 'Floundering' (13%) or 'Struggling' (47.5%) mental health reported symptoms of mental illness; a 'Languishing' group (25.5%) did not report symptoms of mental illness but mental well-being was compromised relative to those who were 'Flourishing' (14%) with high mental well-being. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to examine associations, adjusting for socio-demographic confounders. Protective factors associated with Flourishing mental health included being in secure employment, using screen time to connect with others, and reporting high levels of hope. Both incidental and purposive contact with nature were also associated with Flourishing, while a lack of green/bluespace within walking distance was associated with Languishing, absence of outdoor residential space was associated with Floundering, and lower neighbourhood greenness was associated with all three suboptimal mental health states. Precarious employment, financial stress, living alone, reporting decreased screen time during lockdowns, lower levels of hope, and high disruption of core beliefs were also associated with Struggling and Floundering mental health. Those who were Languishing reported somewhat less hardship and little disruption to core beliefs, but lower levels of hope compared to young people who were Flourishing. This study highlights that young adults require dedicated mental health services to deal with current burden, but should also be supported through a range of preventive strategies which target mental health risk factors, like precarious employment, and enhance protective factors, such as urban green infrastructure.","Oswald, Tassia K; Rumbold, Alice R; Kedzior, Sophie G E; Kohler, Mark; Moore, Vivienne M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,245

Families are under considerable stress, and parents may experience greater psychological distress and disruptions in the parent- child relationship. Some parents may be particularly vulnerable to recent stressors, including those with preexisting psychological disorders and family dysfunction. In the United States, military veterans are one such at-risk population. Recent challenges may exacerbate preexisting conditions and heighten parenting stress, thereby negatively impacting child and family functioning. In this article, we share our experiences developing and piloting a telepsychotherapy parenting skills program for military veterans. The intervention, Online Parenting Pro-Tips (OPPT), combined web-based educational modules addressing child development and positive parenting with live coaching (via videoconferencing link) of parenting skills. Forty-one veterans with a child between the ages of 3 and 9 years enrolled in this trial and 22 completed the 6-session intervention. Veterans who completed the intervention experienced significant reductions in depression, parenting stress, and family dysfunction, with medium to large effect sizes (Cohen's d ranged from .53 to .98). Veterans also reported significant improvements in their child's behaviors. These findings have important implications pertaining to the feasibility and effectiveness of telepsychotherapy interventions to support at-risk families and promote positive parent- child interactions and family functioning during the COVID-19 crisis and beyond. At a practical level, OPPT and similar telepsychotherapy interventions for families could be modified to be delivered via smartphone to increase accessibility and cost-effectiveness for families worldwide.","Riegler, Lindsay James; Raj, Stacey P.; Moscato, Emily L.; Narad, Megan E.; Kincaid, Amberly; Wade, Shari L.",J.

It remains uncertain as to how long this should be implemented, what variables to follow and who would be the ideal candidates for this adjunctive therapy. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients admitted from April to August 2020 within our institution with multifocal pneumonia and hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 who underwent awake-proning for at least 3 hours was conducted. RESULTS: Improvement in respiratory parameters including ROX (SpO2/Fio2/ Respiratory Rate) indices and inflammatory markers within 4 days of institution of awake proning predicted a higher chance for success of this strategy in preventing need for mechanical ventilation. Moreover, benefits of awake proning were limited to patients with mild to moderate ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: Awake prone positioning can be safely performed with improvement in oxygenation. However, its institution may be beneficial only in patients with mild to moderate ARDS and requires careful evaluation of respiratory parameters and serum inflammatory markers to avoid a delay in endotracheal intubation and consequent increase in mortality rates.","Cherian, Sujith V; Li, Chang; Roche, Brad; Reyes, Stephan A; Karanth, Siddharth; Lal, Aditya P; Aisenberg, Gabriel M; Estrada-Y-Martin, Rosa M",Respir Med,,245

During March 29-May 22, 2020, we collected serum samples and associated clinical data from 177 persons in London, UK, who had SARS-CoV-2 infection. We measured IgG against SARS-CoV-2 and compared antibody levels with patient outcomes, demographic information, and laboratory characteristics. We found that 2.0%-8.5% of persons did not seroconvert 3-6 weeks after infection. Persons who seroconverted were older, were more likely to have concurrent conditions, and had higher levels of inflammatory markers. Non-White persons had higher antibody concentrations than those who identified as White; these concentrations did not decline during follow-up. Serologic assay results correlated with disease outcome, race, and other risk factors for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serologic assays can be used in surveillance to clarify the duration and protective nature of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Staines, Henry M; Kirwan, Daniela E; Clark, David J; Adams, Emily R; Augustin, Yolanda; Byrne, Rachel L; Cocozza, Michael; Cubas-Atienzar, Ana I; Cuevas, Luis E; Cusinato, Martina; Davies, Benedict M O; Davis, Mark; Davis, Paul; Duvoix, Annelyse; Eckersley, Nicholas M; Forton, Daniel; Fraser, Alice J; Garrod, Gala; Hadcocks, Linda; Hu, Qinxue; Johnson, Michael; Kay, Grant A; Klekotko, Kesja; Lewis, Zawditu; Macallan, Derek C; Mensah-Kane, Josephine; Menzies, Stefanie; Monahan, Irene; Moore, Catherine M; Nebe-von-Caron, Gerhard; Owen, Sophie I; Sainter, Chris; Sall, Amadou A; Schouten, James; Williams, Christopher T; Wilkins, John; Woolston, Kevin; Fitchett, Joseph R A; Krishna, Sanjeev; Planche, Tim",Emerg. infect. dis,,245

METHODS: Recent findings about SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 infection it causes are reviewed. In addition to international databases and in the absence of hard scientific data, literature search included reports published online from scientific societies and other institutions. RESULTS: The role of anosmia as a COVID-19-related symptom is presented. Further, considerations about steroid administration in ENT-related conditions are also discussed. Due to the close work with mucosa surfaces of the upper aerodigestive tract, otolaryngologists and surrounding staff are considered high risk for coronavirus transmission. Hence, staff protection measures for ENT examinations, surgeries and other procedures during COVID-19 pandemic are recommended. CONCLUSION: Knowledge and evidence about the impact of COVID-19 infection on otolaryngology clinical practice are accumulating rapidly. Additionally to patient's management, safety of health care professionals should be a main goal right now by following strict safety guidelines.","Anagiotos, Andreas; Petrikkos, Georgios",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,245

267503,Seasons of Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is still threatening humankind. Despite first successes in vaccine development and approval, no antiviral treatment is available for COVID-19 patients. The success is further tarnished by the emergence and spreading of mutation variants of SARS-CoV-2, for which some vaccines have lower efficacy. This highlights the urgent need for antiviral therapies even more. This article describes how the genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of the host-virus interaction of human alveolar macrophages and SARS-CoV-2 was refined by incorporating the latest information about the virus's structural proteins and the mutant variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.28, B.1.427/B.1.429, and B.1.617. We confirmed the initially identified guanylate kinase as a potential antiviral target with this refined model and identified further potential targets from the purine and pyrimidine metabolism. The model was further extended by incorporating the virus' lipid requirements. This opened new perspectives for potential antiviral targets in the altered lipid metabolism. Especially the phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis seems to play a pivotal role in viral replication. The guanylate kinase is even a robust target in all investigated mutation variants currently spreading worldwide. These new insights can guide laboratory experiments for the validation of identified potential antiviral targets. Only the combination of vaccines and antiviral therapies will effectively defeat this ongoing pandemic.","Renz, Alina; Widerspick, Lina; Dräger, Andreas",,,245

SARS CoV2 enters host cells via the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 receptor, that is also expressed in adipose tissue. Moreover, adipose tissue is also a source of many proinflammatory mediators and adipokines that might enhance the characteristic COVID-19 cytokine storm due to a chronic low-grade inflammatory preconditioning. Further obesity-dependent thoracic mechanical constraints may also incise negatively into the prognosis of obese subjects with COVID-19.

They do not know where to start to drive change as increased complexity makes it difficult. Leaders lack time to reflect and end up acting too quickly or acting too late as they get stuck in analysis paralysis. They are far removed from the source and are forced to act with a limited understanding of events and their meanings. The role and type of leadership are being tested as we are trying to come out of this crisis. Leaders cannot predict the future but need to make sense of it in order to thrive.

Subjects serologically and/or molecularly (by nasal/throat swab) positives at basal for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded. Primary endpoint was to compare titers of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and seroprotection rates among the cohorts at 3 and 5 weeks from first dose. METHODS: Titration was done using LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test, a quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassay approved by FDA on the basis of robust evidences of concordance (94.4%) between the test at cutoff of 15 AU/mL and the Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test 90% at 1:40 ratio. Cutoff of 15 AU/mL was assumed to discriminate responders to vaccination with a protective titer. Cohorts were compared using Fisher' exact test and the Mann-Whitney test as appropriated. Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), geometric mean ratios and response rates after 1st and 2nd dose were compared in each cohort by Wilcoxon and McNemar tests, respectively.

Expression pattern analysis in situ, however, is mostly lacking in salmon. We examine the embryonic developmental expression of six6, a candidate gene previously identified to be associated with spawning ecotypes and age at sexual maturity, in Atlantic salmon. Six6 is a member of the sine oculis homeobox family of transcription factors and is known to regulate eye and brain development in other vertebrates. We assay the expression of this gene in embryonic Atlantic salmon Salmo salar by whole-mount in situ hybridization. In line with earlier studies in other vertebrate species, we find conserved expression in the developing brain and sensory organs, including optic and olfactory primordia. However, we also find previously unreported domains of expression that suggest additional roles in axial and appendicular development, cardiovascular, intestinal, and sensory organogenesis. Each of these systems are important in the sensory ecology of Atlantic salmon, suggesting it is plausible that six6 may have pleiotropic roles in this complex phenotype.","Moustakas-Verho, Jacqueline Emmanuel; Kurko, Johanna; House, Andrew H; Erkinaro, Jaakko; Debes, Paul; Primmer, Craig Robert",Gene Expr Patterns,,245

RESULTS: Weight (&#916;: 2.51 ± 1.94 kg), height (&#916;: 0.03 ± 0.04 cm), BMI (&#916;: 0.82 ± 1.4), BMI percentile (&#916;: 9.72 ± 16.40), BMI z-score (&#916;: 0.33 ± 1.03), triglyceride (&#916;: 1.50 ± 23.97 mg/dl), very low density lipoprotein (&#916;: 2.99 ± 4.76 mg/dl), insulin (&#916;: 3.07 ± 3.38 mIU/ml), and leptin (&#916;: 3.02 ± 4.69 ng/ml) were significantly increased (p < .05). CONCLUSION: The metabolic side effects of risperidone must be carefully monitored in prepubertal children.","Alan, Burcu Ersoz; Cengel Kultur, S Ebru",Child Adolesc Ment Health,,245

It has been a show of unprecedented global health policies ranging from the legal requirement for public facemask use to the use of tough movement restrictions that has bought the world's economy to its knees. Here, we observe the impact of national lockdowns, facemask usage, and their effect on infection rates. It is clear that healthcare policies alone cannot tackle a pandemic. There is a huge pressure to develop personal protective equipment that not only has the capacity to prevent transmission but also has the ergonomics to be worn for long durations. In this work, we reveal our views and thoughts on the healthcare policies and developing materials and technology strategies that have contributed to reduce the damage of the pandemic, coming from the perspectives of materials scientists and a UK National Health Service consultant doctor.","Ahmed, Jubair; Alenezi, Hussain; Edirisinghe, Ursula; Edirisinghe, Mohan",Emergent Mater,,245

A definition of public management failure is proffered, and both public management frameworks are found to have polarized and opposing views on whether process or outcome should have priority in crisis. We question whether the two major seminal theories in our field are still generalizable when their assumptions about the dichotomy and political neutrality are challenged in times of crises. The polarized perspectives were found to contribute to the public management failures. Ultimately, both frameworks were found to minimize the political influences that public administration and public management operate under, leaving a need for a more holistic and realistic framework.","Young, Sarah L.; Wiley, Kimberly K.; Searing, Elizabeth A.

The CI was able to detect numerous bubbles forming in meme stocks, but had difficulty in significantly predicting social media-induced exogenous rallies.

PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the performance of CT in differentiating COVID-19 from other viral infections using a standardized reporting classification. METHODS: A total of 175 consecutive patients were retrospectively identified from a single tertiary-care medical center from March 15 to March 24, 2020, including 87 with positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 and 88 with negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test, but positive respiratory pathogen panel. Two thoracic radiologists, who were blinded to RT-PCR and respiratory pathogen panel results, reviewed chest CT images independently and classified the imaging findings under 4 categories: ""typical"" appearance, ""indeterminate,"" ""atypical,"" and ""negative"" for pneumonia. The final classification was based on consensus between the readers. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 were older than patients with other viral infections (P=0.038). The inter-rater agreement of CT categories between the readers ranged from good to excellent, &#954;=0.80 (0.73 to 0.87). Final CT categories were statistically different among COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups (P<0.001). CT ""typical"" appearance was more prevalent in the COVID-19 group (64/87, 73.6%) than in the non-COVID-19 group (2/88, 2.3%). When considering CT ""typical"" appearance as a positive test, a sensitivity of 73.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 63%-82.4%), specificity of 97.7% (95% CI: 92%-99.7%), positive predictive value of 97% (95% CI: 89.5%-99.6%), and negative predictive value of 78.9% (95% CI: 70%-86.1%) were observed. CONCLUSION: The standardized chest CT classification demonstrated high specificity and positive predictive value in differentiating COVID-19 from other viral infections when presenting a ""typical"" appearance in a high pretest probability environment. Good to excellent inter-rater agreement was found regarding the CT standardized categories between the readers.","Borges da Silva Teles, Gustavo; Kaiser Uruhary Nunes Fonseca, Eduardo; Yokoo, Patricia; Marques Almeida Silva, Murilo; Yanata, Elaine; Shoji, Hamilton; Bastos Duarte Passos, Rodrigo; Caruso Chate, Rodrigo; Szarf, Gilberto",J. thorac imaging,,245

289120,Invasive aspergillosis as an under-recognized superinfection in COVID-19,2020,"The geriatric population constitutes a large slice of the population of Western countries and a class of fragile patients, with greater deaths due to COVID-19. The patterns of healthcare utilization change during pandemic disease outbreaks. Identifying the patterns of changes of this particular fragile subpopulation is important for future preparedness and response. Overcrowding in the emergency department (ED) can occur because of the volume of patients waiting to be seen, delays in patient assessment or treatment in the ED, or impediments to leaving the ED once the treatment has been completed. Overcrowding has become a serious and growing issue globally, which represents a serious impediment to healthcare utilization. To estimate the rate of ED visits attributable to the outbreak and guide the planning of strategies for managing ED access or after the outbreak of transmittable respiratory diseases. This observational study was based on a retrospective review of the epidemiological and clinical records of patients aged > 75 years who visited the Foundation IRCCS Policlinic San Matteo during the first wave of COVID-19 outbreak (February 21 to May 1, 2020; pandemic group). The analysis methods included estimation of the changes in the epidemiological and clinical data from the annual baseline data after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcome measures and analysis: Primary objective is the evaluation of ED admission rate change and ED overcrowding. Secondary objectives are the evaluation of modes of ED access by reason and triage code, access types, clinical outcomes (such as admission and mortality rates). During the pandemic, ED crowding increased dramatically, although the overall number of patients decreased, in the face of a percentage increase in those with high-acuity conditions, because of changes in patient management that have prolonged length of stay (LOS) and increased rates of access block. Overcrowding during the COVID-19 pandemic can be attributed to the Access Block. Access Block solutions are hence required to prevent a recurrence of crowding to any new viral wave or new epidemic in the future.","Savioli, Gabriele; Ceresa, Iride Francesca; Novelli, Viola; Ricevuti, Giovanni; Bressan, Maria Antonietta; Oddone, Enrico",Intern. emerg. med,,245

Caring for patients with dementia suffering from COVID-19 is challenging due to unclear symptom presentation, delirium, and maintaining isolation procedures. CASE PRESENTATION: A man in his sixties with dementia, hospitalised in a psychogeriatric ward, presented with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms and recovered within 24 hours. Ten days later he developed more severe symptoms. PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Over the following two months his clinical state fluctuated, from almost symptom-free days to being bedridden and assessed as potentially terminal. After the initial positive test, he had three consecutive negative tests, before he again tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Uncertainty as to whether the patient remained contagious resulted in isolation of the patient for over two months. INTERPRETATION: PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2 does not differentiate between intact virus and remnants thereof, and patients may test positive for a long time. This along with a fluctuating clinical course makes it difficult for clinicians to decide when to end isolation of COVID-19 patients.","Aakhus, Eivind; Finbråten, Elena H; Finnes, Trine; Dons, Tine Smedsund; Borza, Tom",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,,245

ACE2 plays an important physiological role, practically in all the organs and systems. Also, ACE2 exerts protective functions in various models of pathologies with acute and chronic inflammation. While ACE2 downregulation by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein leads to an overactivation of Angiotensin (Ang) II/AT1R axis and the deleterious effects of Ang II may explain the multiorgan dysfunction seen in patients. Specifically, the role of Ang II leading to the appearance of Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) and the cytokine storm in COVID-19 is discussed below.

Knowledge on the role of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was not available. Methods: The study included all the cases reported from March 8 - May 31, 2020. Individuals with a history of international or domestic travel from high burden states, Influenza-like Illness or Severe Acute Respiratory Illness and high-risk contacts of COVID-19 cases were included. Detailed analysis based on contact tracing data available from the line-list of state surveillance unit was performed using cluster network analysis software. Findings: Amongst the 3404 COVID-19 positive cases, 3096 (91%) were asymptomatic while 308 (9%) were symptomatic. Majority of asymptomatic cases were in the age range of 16 and 45 years while symptomatic cases were between 31 and 65 years. Mortality rate was especially higher among middle-aged and elderly cases with co-morbidities, 34/38 (89·4%). Cluster network analysis of 822 cases indicated that the secondary attack rate, size of the cluster and superspreading events were higher when the source case was symptomatic as compared to an asymptomatic. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that both asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases transmit the infection, although symptomatic cases were the main driving force within the state during the beginning of the pandemic. Considering the large proportion of asymptomatic cases, their ability to spread infection cannot be overlooked. Notwithstanding the limitations and bias in identifying asymptomatic cases, the findings have major implications for testing policies. Active search, early testing and treatment of symptomatic elderly patients with comorbidities should be prioritized for containing the spread of COVID-19 and reducing mortality.

The rarity of these case poses therapeutic dilemmas about their further management. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 61 year old gentleman who had covid19 infection 2 months back, presented with new onset myasthenia gravis and an anterior mediastinal mass. He was diagnosed as a case of anti acetyl choline receptor antibody positive thymomatous myasthenia gravis. The patient was posted for video assisted thoracoscopic excision of thymoma. The procedure was uneventful and patient was discharged with improvement in myasthenic symptoms. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of WHO Type A Spindle cell thymoma. DISCUSSION: SARS CoV19 infection is associated with an array of autoimmune disorders due to various proposed phenomenon including molecular mimicry and loss of immune tolerance. Post infectious thymomatous myasthenia gravis is extremely uncommon, and can be managed with open, minimally invasive or robotic approach. CONCLUSION: This is the first documented case of post covid19 infection thymomatous myasthenia gravis to the best of our knowledge, managed with minimally invasive thoracoscopic surgery.

We compare the resulting pulmonary complications, need for intensive care and in-hospital mortality depending on respiratory history and virus. RESULTS: In the 89â530 COVID-19 cases, 16.03% had at least one CRD, which was significantly less frequently than in the 45â819 seasonal influenza patients. Patients suffering from chronic respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension were underrepresented, contrary to those with lung cancer, sleep apnea, emphysema, and interstitial pulmonary diseases (ILD). COVID-19 patients with CRD developed significantly more ventilator-associated pneumonia and pulmonary embolism than influenza patients. They needed intensive care significantly more often and had a higher mortality rate (except for asthma) when compared to patients with COVID-19 but without CRD, or patients with influenza. CONCLUSION: Patients with prior respiratory diseases were globally less likely to be hospitalised for COVID-19 than for influenza but were at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 and had a higher mortality rate compared to influenza patients and patients without a history of respiratory illness.Our data suggest that these patients should have priority access to SARS-CoV2 vaccination.","Beltramo, Guillaume; Cottenet, Jonathan; Mariet, Anne-Sophie; Georges, Marjolaine; Piroth, Lionel; Tubert-Bitter, Pascale; Bonniaud, Philippe; Quantin, Catherine",Eur. respir. j,,245

Guidelines for treatment of acne were last published in 2016. The pathogenesis of acne is multifactorial: follicular hyperkeratinization, bacteria, sebum production, androgens, and inflammation all play a role. The gram-positive microaerophilic bacteria Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes) promote development of acne lesions by secreting chemotactic factors that attract leukocytes to the follicle, causing inflammation.","Anonymous,",Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics,,245

During this containment phase, an influx of COVID-19 patients requiring surgical interventions is expected. To combat the situation, every health care staff must implement and adhere to various infection prevention and control measures. In this article, we have addressed the importance of basic infection prevention and control practices required for handling COVID-19 cases, especially, those requiring acute surgical care. On one hand, certain non-emergency procedures need to be delayed, on the other hand, all surgeries during this period need to be proactively performed with appropriate infection control precautions regardless of the COVID-19 status of the patient. Prudent decisions and a conservative approach while making the best choices regarding surgeries will not only ensure personal protection but will also preserve important resources, manpower, hospital beds, and equipment for repurposing during this urgent crisis.","Garg, Rahul; Das, Arghya; Banerjee, Tuhina",J.

304000,COVID-19 pandemic and international travel: Turkey's experience,2021,"BACKGROUND: In 1918 an unknown infectious agent spread around the world infecting over one-third of the general population and killing almost 50 million people. Many countries were at war, the First World War. Since Spain was a neutral country and Spanish press could report about the infection without censorship, this condition is commonly remembered as ""Spanish influenza"". This review examines several aspects during the 1918 influenza pandemic to bring out evidences which might be useful to imagine the possible magnitude of the present coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: In the first part of this review we will examine the origin of the SARS-Coronavirus-2 and 1918 Spanish Influenza Virus and the role played by host and environment in its diffusion. We will also include in our analysis an evaluation of different approaches utilized to restrain the spread of pandemic and to treat infected patients. In the second part, we will try to imagine the magnitude of the present COVID-19 pandemic and the possible measures able to restrain in the present environment its spread. RESULTS: Several factors characterize the outcome in a viral pandemic infection. They include the complete knowledge of the virus, the complete knowledge of the host and of the environment where the host lives and the pandemic develops. CONCLUSION: By comparing the situation seen in 1918 with the current one, we are now in a more favourable position. The experience of the past teaches us that their success is linked to a rapid, constant and lasting application. Then, rather than coercion, awareness of the need to observe such prevention measures works better.","Scarpa, Raffaele; Caso, Francesco; Costa, Luisa; Passavanti, Saverio; Vitale, Maria Grazia; Trojaniello, Claudia; Del Puente, Antonio; Ascierto, Paolo A",J Transl Med,,245

Data covering about 2 months (March-April 2020) were retrieved from public databases. Infection risk was defined as the ratio between infected and infectious. In a separate sensitivity analysis different models were applied to estimate the number of infectious people per day. The impact of air pollution was assessed through a linear regression on the natural logarithm of infection risk. Risk of COVID-19 mortality was estimated by Poisson regression. Both pollutants were positively correlated with the risk of infection with the coefficient for NO2 being 0.032 and for PM10 0.014. That association was significant for the irritant gas (pâ¯= 0.012) but not for particles (pâ¯= 0.22). Pollutants did not affect COVID-19-related mortality.

308541,"Reply to ""Mortality-related immune features and COVID-19""",2021,"The effects of COVID-19 extend beyond the pandemic and are expected to transform healthcare in various ways, many of which remain unknown. With social distancing, telemedicine may become the preferred communication channel between caregivers and patients. Implications for cerebral palsy (CP) children are that this will pose a challenge within this transformation. CP, as a discreet entity, is not considered a risk factor. However, specific comorbidities in individuals with CP, such as chronic lung disease, are known as COVID-19 risk factors. The overall risk for the CP population is probably a factor of age and comorbidities. Staying at home for CP children is both a challenge and an opportunity. Escalation of behavioral conflicts or improved participation and equality within the household may emerge. Interestingly, restricted mobility for the general population narrows existing gaps of ambulation. Telemedicine is the primary way of providing services for chronic conditions during the pandemic and is expected to expand beyond pre-Coronavirus era use. The advantages of telemedicine vary, more so during pandemic times, according to severity, restrictions, and availably of telemedicine. A multidisciplinary therapeutic presence is more accessible with telemedicine, bringing together various specialties and approaches to the child's natural environment. Accessible, continuous care is expected to lower comorbidities, as demonstrated for other chronic conditions. Enhanced monitoring is crucial for younger children as devastating complications, such as hip dysplasia, could be minimized.

METHODS: We conducted a comparative model-based analysis using three independent NCI Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network cervical models to quantify the impact of eight alternative COVID-19-related screening disruption scenarios compared to a scenario of no disruptions. Scenarios varied by the duration of the disruption (6 or 24 months), steps in the screening process being disrupted (primary screening, surveillance, colposcopy, excisional treatment), and primary screening modality (cytology alone or cytology plus human papillomavirus ""cotesting""). RESULTS: The models consistently showed that COVID-19-related disruptions yield small net increases in cervical cancer cases by 2027, which are greater for women previously screened with cytology compared with cotesting. When disruptions affected all four steps in the screening process under cytology-based screening, there were an additional 5-7 and 38-45 cases per one million screened for 6- and 24-month disruptions, respectively. In contrast, under cotesting, there were additional 4-5 and 35-45 cases per one million screened for 6- and 24-month disruptions, respectively. The majority (58-79%) of the projected increases in cases under cotesting were due to disruptions to surveillance, colposcopies, or excisional treatment, rather than to primary screening. CONCLUSIONS: Women in need of surveillance, colposcopies, or excisional treatment, or whose last primary screen did not involve human papillomavirus testing, may comprise priority groups for reintroductions.","Burger, Emily A; Jansen, Erik El; Killen, James; Kok, Inge McM de; Smith, Megan A; Sy, Stephen; Dunnewind, Niels; G Campos, Nicole; Haas, Jennifer S; Kobrin, Sarah; Kamineni, Aruna; Canfell, Karen; Kim, Jane J",J Med Screen,,245

Here we compared the epidemiological characteristics of laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases with COVID-19 in Wuhan. METHODS: Demographics, case severity and outcomes of 29,886 confirmed cases and 21,960 clinically diagnosed cases reported between December 2019 and February 24, 2020, were compared. The risk factors were estimated, and the effective reproduction number (Rt) of SARS-CoV-2 was also calculated. RESULTS: The age and occupation distribution of confirmed cases and clinically diagnosed cases were consistent, and their sex ratio were 1.0 and 0.9, respectively. The epidemic curve of clinical diagnosis cases was similar to that of confirmed cases, and the city centers had more cumulative cases and higher incidence density than suburbs in both of two groups. The proportion of severe and critical cases (21.5 % vs. 14.0 %, P < 0.0001) and case fatality rates (5.2 % vs. 1.2 %, P < 0.0001) of confirmed cases were all higher than those of clinically diagnosed cases. Risk factors for death we observed in both of two groups were older age, male, severe or critical cases. Rt showed the same trend in two groups, it dropped below 1.0 on February 6 among confirmed cases, and February 8 among clinically diagnosed cases. CONCLUSIONS: The demographic characteristics and spatiotemporal distributions of confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases are roughly similar, but the disease severity and clinical outcome of clinically diagnosed cases are better than those of confirmed cases.

319524,Why multisystem lammatory syndrome in children has been less commonly described in Asia?,2020,"Scenario studies of energy transition generally point to the central role of electricity. This notion is ambiguous as its interpretation can range from an electricity-only policy to portfolios of different energy vectors with a dominance of electricity. This ambiguity adds to the uncertainty that already pervades today’s investment environment. This paper examines the centrality of electricity through a so-called “variational scenario” analysis with policies obtained by a mix of electricity-only and green gas penetration while maintaining constant decarbonization objectives. Electricity is a complex product that can only be further complicated by the high penetration of renewables and its interaction with the production and use of synthetic fuels. The variational scenario analysis is conducted with sufficiently fine (hourly) granularity to produce an adequate representation of these phenomena. It shows that tilting the central role of electricity to a mix of electricity and green gas offers several advantages in terms of efficiency, flexibility of investment strategies, and robustness with respect to major uncertainties. It shows that the variational scenario analysis can be extended to more complex mixes of policies.","Gauthier de Maere, d’Aertrycke Smeers Yves de Peufeilhoux Hugues Pierre-Laurent Lucille",Energies,,245
319600,Running a virtual allergy division and training program in the time of COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between antibody status and cycle threshold (Ct) values, the prognostic value of the latter for COVID-19 patients, and the inter-assay comparability of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values. METHODS: In 347 COVID-19 inpatients, SARS-CoV-2 Ct values (via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction) on admission were compared between 2 assays and correlated with the antibody response (in the course of the disease), the clinical course and the time since onset of symptoms. RESULTS: Ct values for 2 of 3 target genes showed significant differences between the 2 assays used (P=0.012 and P<0.0001). Ct values were significantly higher for antibody positive patients (P<0.0001) and positively correlated with the amount of time since onset of symptoms (R: 0.332-0.363; P<0.001). Patients with fatal outcomes showed higher viral loads than survivors (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Ct values depend strongly on assay used and target gene examined and should not be used as quantitative values to guide therapeutic or diagnostic decisions. The inverse association between antibody status and viral load suggests that antibodies contribute to the elimination of the virus, independent of the outcome, which is influenced by the viral load on admission and might depend more strongly on other parts of the immune response.","Markewitz, Robert; Torge, Antje; Wandinger, Klaus-Peter; Pauli, Daniela; Dargvainiene, Justina; Franke, Andre; Bujanda, Luis; Marimón, José Maria; Banales, Jesus M; Gutierrez-Stampa, María A; Nafría, Beatriz; Junker, Ralf",Int J Infect Dis,,245
319601,Running a virtual allergy division and training program in the time of COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: In response to supply shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs or ""masks""), which are typically single-use devices in healthcare settings, are routinely being used for prolonged periods and in some cases decontaminated under ""reuse"" and ""extended use"" policies. However, the reusability of N95 masks is limited by degradation of fit. Possible substitutes, such as KN95 masks meeting Chinese standards, frequently fail fit testing even when new. The purpose of this study was to develop an inexpensive frame for damaged and poorly fitting masks using readily available materials and 3D printing. RESULTS: An iterative design process yielded a mask frame consisting of two 3D printed side pieces, malleable wire links that users press against their face, and cut lengths of elastic material that go around the head to hold the frame and mask in place. Volunteers (n = 45;average BMI = 25.4), underwent qualitative fit testing with and without mask frames wearing one or more of four different brands of FFRs conforming to US N95 or Chinese KN95 standards. Masks passed qualitative fit testing in the absence of a frame at rates varying from 48 to 94 % (depending on mask model). For individuals who underwent testing using respirators with broken or defective straps, 80-100 % (average 85 %) passed fit testing with mask frames. Among individuals who failed fit testing with a KN95, ~ 50 % passed testing by using a frame. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that mask frames can prolong the lifespan of N95 and KN95 masks by serving as a substitute for broken or defective bands without adversely affecting fit. Use of frames made it possible for ~ 73 % of the test population to achieve a good fit based on qualitative and quantitative testing criteria, approaching the 85-90 % success rate observed for intact N95 masks. Frames therefore represent a simple and inexpensive way of expanding access to PPE and extending their useful life. For clinicians and institutions interested in mask frames, designs and specifications are provided without restriction for use or modification. To ensure adequate performance in clinical settings, fit testing with user-specific masks and PanFab frames is required.","McAvoy, M.; Bui, A. N.; Hansen, C.; Plana, D.; Said, J.

325206,"More Data on Risks and Outcomes of COVID-19 in Asthma, COPD, and Bronchiectasis",2021,"INTRODUCTION: Early studies suggest that acute cerebrovascular events may be common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and may be associated with a high mortality rate. Most cerebrovascular events described have been ischemic strokes, but both intracerebral hemorrhage and rarely cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) have also been reported. The diagnosis of CVST can be elusive, with wide-ranging and nonspecific presenting symptoms that can include headache or altered sensorium alone. OBJECTIVE: To describe the presentation, barriers to diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of CVST in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We abstracted data on all patients diagnosed with CVST and COVID-19 from March 1 to August 9, 2020 at Boston Medical Center. Subsequently, we reviewed the literature and extracted all published cases of CVST in patients with COVID-19 from January 1, 2020 through August 9, 2020 and included all studies with case descriptions. RESULTS: We describe the clinical features and management of CVST in 3 women with COVID-19 who developed CVST days to months after initial COVID-19 symptoms. Two patients presented with encephalopathy and without focal neurologic deficits, while one presented with visual symptoms. All patients were treated with intravenous hydration and anticoagulation. None suffered hemorrhagic complications, and all were discharged home. We identified 12 other patients with CVST in the setting of COVID-19 via literature search. There was a female predominance (54.5%), most patients presented with altered sensorium (54.5%), and there was a high mortality rate (36.4%). CONCLUSIONS: During this pandemic, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for CVST in patients with a recent history of COVID-19 presenting with non-specific neurological symptoms such as headache to provide expedient management and prevent complications. The limited data suggests that CVST in COVID-19 is more prevalent in females and may be associated with high mortality.","Nwajei, Felix; Anand, Pria; Abdalkader, Mohamad; Andreu Arasa, Vanesa C; Aparicio, Hugo J; Behbahani, Siavash; Curiale, Gioacchino; Daneshmand, Ali; Dasenbrock, Hormuzdiyar; Mayo, Thomas; Mian, Asim; Nguyen, Thanh; Ong, Charlene; Romero, J Rafael; Sakai, Osamu; Takahashi, Courtney; Cervantes-Arslanian, Anna M",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,245

328759,Trends in hospitalizations for asthma during the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan,2020,"The outbreak of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a worldwide threat to public health. COVID-19 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can develop clinical symptoms that are often confused with the infections of other respiratory pathogens. Sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 with the ability to discriminate from other viruses is urgently needed for COVID-19 diagnosis. Herein, we streamlined a highly efficient CRISPR-Cas12a-based nucleic acid detection platform, termed Cas12a-linked beam unlocking reaction (CALIBURN). We show that CALIBURN could detect SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses and influenza viruses with little cross-reactivity. Importantly, CALIBURN allowed accurate diagnosis of clinical samples with extremely low viral loads, which is a major obstacle for the clinical applications of existing CRISPR diagnostic platforms. When tested on the specimens from SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative donors, CALIBURN exhibited 73.0% positive and 19.0% presumptive positive rates and 100% specificity. Moreover, unlike existing CRISPR detection methods that were mainly restricted to respiratory specimens, CALIBURN displayed consistent performance across both respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens, suggesting its broad specimen compatibility. Finally, using a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we demonstrated that CALIBURN allowed detection of coexisting pathogens without cross-reactivity from a single tissue specimen. Our results suggest that CALIBURN can serve as a versatile platform for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and other respiratory infectious diseases.","Wang, Yu; Liu, Donglan; Lin, Huihuang; Chen, Dingbin; Sun, Jing; Xie, Yusang; Wang, Xinjie; Ma, Peixiang; Nie, Yan; Mei, Hong; Zhao, Baihui; Huang, Xingxu; Jiang, Ge; Jiang, Xianxing; Qu, Jieming; Zhao, Jincun; Liu, Jia",ACS Chem Biol,,245
329867,COVID-19 pandemic in Malawi: Did public sociopolitical events gatherings contribute to its first-wave local transmission?,2021,"Cartilage wear particles are released into the synovial fluid by mechanical and chemical degradation of the articular surfaces during osteoarthritis and attach to the synovial membrane. Accumulation of wear particles could alter key tissue-level mechanical properties of the synovium, hindering its characteristically low-friction interactions with underlying articular surfaces in the synovial joint. The present study employs a custom loading device to further the characterization of native synovium friction properties, while investigating the hypothesis that attachment of cartilage wear particles increases friction coefficient. Juvenile bovine synovium demonstrated characteristically low friction coefficients in sliding contact with glass, in agreement with historical measurements. Friction coefficient increased with higher normal load in saline, while lubrication with native synovial fluid maintained low friction coefficients at higher loads. Cartilage wear particles generated from juvenile bovine cartilage attached directly to synovium explants in static culture, with incorporation onto the tissue denoted by cell migration onto the particle surface. In dilute synovial fluid mimicking the decreased lubricating properties during osteoarthritis, wear particle attachment significantly increased friction coefficient against glass, and native cartilage and synovium. In addition to providing a novel characterization of synovial joint tribology this work highlights a potential mechanism for cartilage wear particles to perpetuate the degradative environment of osteoarthritis by modulating tissue-level properties of the synovium that could impact macroscopic wear as well as mechanical stimuli transmitted to resident cells.","Estell, Eben G; Murphy, Lance A; Gangi, Lianna R; Shah, Roshan P; Ateshian, Gerard A; Hung, Clark T",J Biomech,,245

However, in the more industrialized countries, physical activity rates are declining, and the emerging COVID-19 pandemic may amplify this scenario. Thus, this study aimed to report the Italian population's physical activity profile living in the North-western regions during the national lockdown. Methods: Physical activity was assessed using the official Italian short form of IPAQ, intended for Social Networking Services (SNS). Participation was voluntary, and people could fill the questionnaire simply by clicking on a specific link. Results: The final sample size was 612 Italians, male and female, equally distributed (49.1% male and 50.9% female). Data showed a percentage of 15.4% of inactive subjects (MET < 700), 61.8% of moderate-active (MET 700-2500), and 22.9% of active people (MET > 2500). Women were more inactive than men (p < 0.01; 57.4% vs 42.6%). Furthermore, participants were classified into four classes of age: 18-29; 30-44; 45-59; and 60-79. Class 18-29 was prevalent (p < 0.01, 68.3%) and showed higher levels of physical activity (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Italians living in North-western regions maintained a moderate amount of physical activity during the quarantine.

The aim of this paper is to review studies on the course of mental health problems during and after the first lockdown phase. METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of multi-wave studies in general populations with time points during and after the first lockdown phase. Repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that utilised validated instruments were included. The main outcome was whether indicators of mental health problems have changed during and after the first lockdown phase. The study was registered with PROSPERO No. CRD42020218640. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies with 56 indicators were included in the qualitative review. Studies that reported data from pre-pandemic assessments through lockdown indicated an increase in mental health problems. During lockdown, no uniform trend could be identified. After lockdown, mental health problems decreased slightly. CONCLUSIONS: As mental health care utilisation indicators and data on suicides do not suggest an increase in demand during the first lockdown phase, we regard the increase in mental health problems as general distress that is to be expected during a global health crisis. Several methodological, pandemic-related, response-related and health policy-related factors need to be considered when trying to gain a broader perspective on the impact of the first wave of the pandemic and the first phase of lockdown on general populations' mental health.","Richter, Dirk; Riedel-Heller, Steffi; Zürcher, Simeon Joel",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,,245

We conducted a convergent mixed method analysis of audience responses to actor Tom Hanks' March 11, 2020 disclosure of his COVID-19 diagnosis via social media. We collected our data within 24 hours of his announcement, allowing us to quickly capture emotional and cognitive responses to the announcement and to assess both demographic and psychosocial differences in types of people who heard the news in this time frame and those who had not. In our study, 587 participants had heard the news of Hanks' disclosure while 95 had not. Participants who had heard responded to an open-ended prompt asking if the disclosure affected them at all. Those who had not heard were funneled into a field intervention to test how random assignment to seeing Hanks' disclosure post or not would affect audiences' COVID-19-related emotions, cognitions, and willingness to enact prevention behaviors. The results of this mixed methods study revealed differences in responses to Hanks' disclosure based on health information source trust and involvement with Hanks as well as effects of the intervention on efficacy for dealing with COVID-19.

The results showed that the risk of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in AIIRs was low (1.62%, 25/1544) due to the directional airflow and strong environmental hygiene procedures. However, we detected viral RNA on the surface of foot-operated openers and bathroom sinks in AIIRs (viral load: 55.00-3154.50 copies/mL). This might be a source of contamination to connecting corridors and object surfaces through the footwear and gloves used by HCWs.

This study is a prospective collection and review of all cases with a myocarditis/pericarditis diagnosis over a 2-month period at an academic medical center. MethodsProspective case series from 1st June 2021 until 31st July 2021. Patients were identified by admission and discharge diagnoses which included myocarditis or pericarditis. Inclusion criteria: in receipt of mRNA vaccine within one month prior to presentation; The CMR protocol included cine imaging, native T1 and T2 mapping, late gadolinium enhancement and post contrast T1 mapping. All CMR studies were read in consensus by two experienced readers. Diagnosis was based on clinical presentation, ECG/echo findings and serial troponins and was confirmed in each case by CMR. Incidence was estimated from total doses of mRNA vaccine administered in the Ottawa region for the matching time-period. This data was obtained from the Public Health Agency of Ottawa. Results32 patients were identified over the period of interest. Eighteen patients were diagnosed with myocarditis; 12 with myopericarditis; and 2 with pericarditis alone. The median age was 33 years (18-65 years). The sex ratio was 2 females to 29 males. In 5 cases, symptoms developed after only a single dose of mRNA vaccine. In 27 patients, symptoms developed after their second dose of. Median time between vaccine dose and symptoms was 1.5 days (1-26 days). Chest pain was the commonest symptom, but many others were reported. Non-syncopal non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was seen in only a single case. Median LV ejection fraction (EF) was 57% (44-66%). Nine patients had an LVEF below the normal threshold of 55%. Incidence of myopericarditis overall was approximately 10 cases for every 10,000 inoculations. Summary and ConclusionsThis is the largest series in the literature to clearly relate the temporal relationship between mRNA COVID vaccination, symptoms and CMR findings. In most patients, symptom onset began within the first few days after vaccination with corresponding abnormalities in biomarkers and on ECG. Cardiac MRI confirmed acute myocardial and pericardial changes with the presence of edema demonstrated with both tissue mapping and late gadolinium enhancement. Symptoms settled quickly with standard therapy and patients were discharged within a few days. No major adverse cardiac events and no significant arrythmias were noted during inpatient stay. Further follow up will be required to ascertain the longer-term outcomes of this patient group.","Kafil, Tahir; Lamacie, Mariana M; Chenier, Sophie; Taggart, Heather; Ghosh, Nina; Dick, Alexander; Small, Gary; Liu, Peter; Beanlands, Rob S; Mielniczuk, Lisa; Birnie, David; Crean, Andrew M",,,245

This paper aims to provide insight into shifts in alcohol consumption and associated factors during the epidemic. DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional convenience sample of 2307 Australians aged 18 and over who drank at least monthly was recruited through social media. Respondents were asked about their alcohol consumption and purchasing in 2019 prior to the epidemic plus similar questions about their experiences in the month prior to being surveyed between 29 April and 16 May 2020. RESULTS: Reports of average consumption before (3.53 drinks per day [3.36, 3.71 95% confidence interval]) and during (3.52 [3.34, 3.69]) the pandemic were stable. However, young men and those who drank more outside the home in 2019 reported decreased consumption during the pandemic, and people with high levels of stress and those who bulk-bought alcohol when restrictions were announced reported an increase in consumption relative to those who did not. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: A reported increase in consumption among those experiencing more stress suggests that some people may have been drinking to cope during the epidemic. Conversely, the reported decrease in consumption among those who drank more outside of their home in 2019 suggests that closing all on-trade sales did not result in complete substitution of on-premise drinking with home drinking in this group. Monitoring of relevant subgroups to assess long-term changes in consumption in the aftermath of the epidemic is recommended.","Callinan, Sarah; Mojica-Perez, Yvette; Wright, Cassandra J C; Livingston, Michael; Kuntsche, Sandra; Laslett, Anne-Marie; Room, Robin; Kuntsche, Emmanuel",Drug alcohol rev,,245

341795,Bacterial and fungal coinfections in COVID-19 patients hospitalized during the New York City pandemic surge,2020,"I propose a smartphone app that will allow people to participate in the management of their own safety during an epidemic or pandemic such as COVID-19 by enabling them to view, in advance, the risks they would take if they visit some given venue (a cafe, the gym, the workplace, the park,...) and, furthermore, track the accumulation of such risks during the course of any given day or week. This idea can be presented to users of the app as counting points. One point represents some constant probability, $p_\text{point}$, of infection. Then the app would work in a similar way to a calorie counting app (instead of counting calories we count probability increments of being infected). Government could set a maximum recommended number of daily (or weekly) points available to each user in accord with its objectives (bringing the disease under control, allowing essential workers to work, protecting vulnerable individuals, ...). It is posited that this, along with other proposed""levers""would allow government to manage a gradual transition to normalcy. I discuss a circuit framework with wires running between boxes. In this framework the wires represent possible sources of infection, namely individuals and the venues themselves (through deposits of pathogens left at the venue). The boxes represent interactions of these sources (when individuals visit a venue). This circuit framework allows (i) calculation of points cost for visiting venues and (ii) probabilistic contact tracing. The points systems proposed here could complement existing contact tracing apps by adding functionality to permit users to participate in decision making up front.","Hardy, Lucien",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11244v1.pdf,245

Risk Factors for Death, Intubation and Cardiac Arrest among COVID-19 Patients Hospitalized in Eastern North Carolina",2020,"Nidoviruses and arenaviruses are the only known RNA viruses encoding a 3'-5' exonuclease domain (ExoN). The proofreading activity of the ExoN domain has played a key role in the growth of nidoviral genomes, while in arenaviruses this domain partakes in the suppression of the host innate immune signaling. Sequence and structural homology analyses suggest that these proteins have been hijacked from cellular hosts many times. Analysis of the available nidoviral ExoN sequences reveals a high conservation level comparable to that of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp), which are the most conserved viral proteins. Two highly preserved zinc fingers are present in all nidoviral exonucleases, while in the arenaviral protein only one zinc finger can be identified. This is in sharp contrast with the reported lack of zinc fingers in cellular ExoNs, and opens the possibility of therapeutic strategies in the struggle against COVID-19.","Cruz-González, Adrián; Muñoz-Velasco, Israel; Cottom-Salas, Wolfgang; Becerra, Arturo; Campillo-Balderas, José A; Hernández-Morales, Ricardo; Vázquez-Salazar, Alberto; Jácome, Rodrigo; Lazcano, Antonio",PLoS One,,245

344431,"COVID-19 outbreak in a personal service setting in Kingston, Ontario, 2020",2021,"BACKGROUND: On December 12th 2019, a new coronavirus (SARS-Cov2) emerged in Wuhan, China, sparking a pandemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans (COVID-19). On the 24th of April 2020, the number of COVID-19 deaths in the world, according to the COVID-Case Tracker by Johns Hopkins University, was 195,313, and the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases was 2,783,512. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a massive impact on human health, causing sudden lifestyle changes, through social distancing and isolation at home, with social and economic consequences. Optimizing public health during this pandemic requires not only knowledge from the medical and biological sciences, but also of all human sciences related to lifestyle, social and behavioural studies, including dietary habits and lifestyle. METHODS: Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating habits and lifestyle changes among the Italian population aged &#8805; 12 years. The study comprised a structured questionnaire packet that inquired demographic information (age, gender, place of residence, current employment); anthropometric data (reported weight and height); dietary habits information (adherence to the Mediterranean diet, daily intake of certain foods, food frequency, and number of meals/day); lifestyle habits information (grocery shopping, habit of smoking, sleep quality and physical activity). The survey was conducted from the 5th to the 24th of April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 3533 respondents have been included in the study, aged between 12 and 86 years (76.1% females). The perception of weight gain was observed in 48.6% of the population; 3.3% of smokers decided to quit smoking; a slight increased physical activity has been reported, especially for bodyweight training, in 38.3% of respondents; the population group aged 18-30 years resulted in having a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet when compared to the younger and the elderly population (p < 0.001; p < 0.001, respectively); 15% of respondents turned to farmers or organic, purchasing fruits and vegetables, especially in the North and Center of Italy, where BMI values were lower. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we have provided for the first time data on the Italian population lifestyle, eating habits and adherence to the Mediterranean Diet pattern during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, our data need to be confirmed and investigated in future more extensive population studies.","Di Renzo, Laura; Gualtieri, Paola; Pivari, Francesca; Soldati, Laura; Attinà, Alda; Cinelli, Giulia; Leggeri, Claudia; Caparello, Giovanna; Barrea, Luigi; Scerbo, Francesco; Esposito, Ernesto; De Lorenzo, Antonino",J Transl Med,,245

346692,Inside China and COVID-19: Questions and answers,2020,"Introduction: To explore the involvement of the cardiovascular system in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we investigated whether myocardial injury occurred in COVID-19 patients and assessed the performance of serum high-sensitivity cardiac Troponin I (hs-cTnI) levels in predicting disease severity and 30-day in-hospital fatality. Methods: We included 244 COVID-19 patients, who were admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University with no preexisting cardiovascular disease or renal dysfunction. We analyzed the data including patients' clinical characteristics, cardiac biomarkers, severity of medical conditions, and 30-day in-hospital fatality. We performed multivariable Cox regressions and the receiver operating characteristic analysis to assess the association of cardiac biomarkers on admission with disease severity and prognosis. Results: In this retrospective observational study, 11% of COVID-19 patients had increased hs-cTnI levels (>40 ng/L) on admission. Of note, serum hs-cTnI levels were positively associated with the severity of medical conditions (median [interquartile range (IQR)]: 6.00 [6.00-6.00] ng/L in 91 patients with moderate conditions, 6.00 [6.00-18.00] ng/L in 107 patients with severe conditions, and 11.00 [6.00-56.75] ng/L in 46 patients with critical conditions, P for trend=0.001). Moreover, compared with those with normal cTnI levels, patients with increased hs-cTnI levels had higher in-hospital fatality (adjusted hazard ratio [95% CI]: 4.79 [1.46-15.69]). The receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis suggested that the inclusion of hs-cTnI levels into a panel of empirical prognostic factors substantially improved the prediction performance for severe or critical conditions (area under the curve (AUC): 0.71 (95% CI: 0.65-0.78) vs. 0.65 (0.58-0.72), P=0.01), as well as for 30-day fatality (AUC: 0.91 (0.85-0.96) vs. 0.77 (0.62-0.91), P=0.04). A cutoff value of 20 ng/L of hs-cTnI level led to the best prediction to 30-day fatality. Conclusions: In COVID-19 patients with no preexisting cardiovascular disease, 11% had increased hs-cTnI levels. Besides empirical prognostic factors, serum hs-cTnI levels upon admission provided independent prediction to both the severity of the medical condition and 30-day in-hospital fatality. These findings may shed important light on the clinical management of COVID-19.","Cao, Jiatian; Zheng, Yan; Luo, Zhe; Mei, Zhendong; Yao, Yumeng; Liu, Zilong; Liang, Chao; Yang, Hongbo; Song, Yanan; Yu, Kaihuan; Gao, Yan; Zhu, Chouwen; Huang, Zheyong; Qian, Juying; Ge, Junbo",Theranostics,,245

353444,Effective Containment of a COVID-19 Subregional Outbreak in Italy Through Strict Quarantine and Rearrangement of Local Health Care Services,2021,"PURPOSE: Mast cells, historically known for their effector function in the induction of allergic diseases, reside in all vascularized tissues of the body in particular proximity to blood and lymphatic vessels. As neighboring sentinel cells to blood vessels, mast cells have been associated with angiogenesis. Here we assess the direct contribution of mast cells to neovascularization at the ocular surface. METHODS: Corneal neovascularization was induced by placing a single figure-of-eight intrastromal suture 1â¯mm from the limbus in mast cell-deficient (cKitW-sh), C57BL/6, and Balb/c mice. Corneas were harvested at 6â¯h post-suture to quantify cKit+FcÎµR1+ mast cells using flow cytometry and tear wash was collected within 6â¯h to measure ß-hexosaminidase and tryptase. Neovascularization was assessed using slit-lamp biomicroscope and immunohistochemistry analysis of corneas harvested on day 4 post-suture. To investigate the effects of mast cells on blood vessel growth, mast cells were co-cultured with vascular endothelial cells (VECs), and tube formation and proliferation of VECs were measured. 2% cromolyn was administered locally to inhibit mast cell activation in vivo. RESULTS: Placement of corneal suture activates ocular surface mast cells which infiltrate into the cornea adjacent to new vessels. Mast cell-deficient mice develop significantly fewer new vessels following suture placement. Mast cells directly promote VEC proliferation and tube formation, partly through secreting high levels of VEGF-A. Pharmacological inhibition of mast cell activation results in significantly less corneal neovascularization. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that ocular surface mast cells are critical to corneal neovascularization, suggesting mast cells as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of corneal neovascularization.","Cho, WonKyung; Mittal, Sharad K; Elbasiony, Elsayed; Chauhan, Sunil K",Ocular surf,,245

354287,Atrioventricular Block in Children With Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome,2020,"Due to the urgent need of a therapeutic treatment for coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, a number of FDA-approved/repurposed drugs have been suggested as antiviral candidates at clinics, without sufficient information. Furthermore, there have been extensive debates over antiviral candidates for their effectiveness and safety against severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2), suggesting that rapid preclinical animal studies are required to identify potential antiviral candidates for human trials. To this end, the antiviral efficacies of lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and emtricitabine-tenofovir for SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed in the ferret infection model. While the lopinavir-ritonavir-, hydroxychloroquine sulfate-, or emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group exhibited lower overall clinical scores than the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated control group, the virus titers in nasal washes, stool specimens, and respiratory tissues were similar between all three antiviral-candidate-treated groups and the PBS-treated control group. Only the emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group showed lower virus titers in nasal washes at 8 days postinfection (dpi) than the PBS-treated control group. To further explore the effect of immune suppression on viral infection and clinical outcome, ferrets were treated with azathioprine, an immunosuppressive drug. Compared to the PBS-treated control group, azathioprine-immunosuppressed ferrets exhibited a longer period of clinical illness, higher virus titers in nasal turbinate, delayed virus clearance, and significantly lower serum neutralization (SN) antibody titers. Taken together, all antiviral drugs tested marginally reduced the overall clinical scores of infected ferrets but did not significantly affect in vivo virus titers. Despite the potential discrepancy of drug efficacies between animals and humans, these preclinical ferret data should be highly informative to future therapeutic treatment of COVID-19 patients.IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to spread worldwide, with rapidly increasing numbers of mortalities, placing increasing strain on health care systems. Despite serious public health concerns, no effective vaccines or therapeutics have been approved by regulatory agencies. In this study, we tested the FDA-approved drugs lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and emtricitabine-tenofovir against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a highly susceptible ferret infection model. While most of the drug treatments marginally reduced clinical symptoms, they did not reduce virus titers, with the exception of emtricitabine-tenofovir treatment, which led to diminished virus titers in nasal washes at 8 dpi. Further, the azathioprine-treated immunosuppressed ferrets showed delayed virus clearance and low SN titers, resulting in a prolonged infection. As several FDA-approved or repurposed drugs are being tested as antiviral candidates at clinics without sufficient information, rapid preclinical animal studies should proceed to identify therapeutic drug candidates with strong antiviral potential and high safety prior to a human efficacy trial.","Park, Su-Jin; Yu, Kwang-Min; Kim, Young-Il; Kim, Se-Mi; Kim, Eun-Ha; Kim, Seong-Gyu; Kim, Eun Ji; Casel, Mark Anthony B; Rollon, Rare; Jang, Seung-Gyu; Lee, Min-Hyeok; Chang, Jae-Hyung; Song, Min-Suk; Jeong, Hye Won; Choi, Younho; Chen, Weiqiang; Shin, Woo-Jin; Jung, Jae U; Choi, Young Ki",mBio (Online),,245

A decision-maker must accept or reject each value when it is presented, and may accept at most $k$ values in total. The objective is to maximize the expected sum of accepted values. We study the performance of static threshold policies, which accept the first $k$ values exceeding a fixed threshold (or all such values, if fewer than $k$ exist). We show that using an optimal threshold guarantees a $\gamma_k = 1 - e^{-k}k^k/k!$ fraction of the offline optimal solution, and provide an example demonstrating that this guarantee is tight. We also provide simple algorithms that achieve this guarantee. The first sets a threshold such that the expected number of values exceeding the threshold is equal to $k$, and offers a guarantee of $\gamma_k$ if $k \geq 5$. The second sets a threshold so that $k \cdot \gamma_k$ values are accepted in expectation, and offers a guarantee of $\gamma_k$ for all $k$. To establish these guarantees, we prove a result about sums of independent Bernoulli random variables, which extends a classical result of Hoeffding (1956) and is of general interest. Finally, we note that our algorithms can be implemented in settings with restricted information about agents' values. This makes them practical in settings such as the allocation of COVID-19 vaccines.","Arnosti, Nick; Ma, Will",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12893v1.pdf,245

Based on a risk management perspective, this study explores the mechanism of the risk perception effect on social distancing in order to improve individual physical distancing behavior. The data for this study were collected from 317 Chinese residents in May 2020 using an internet-based survey. A structural equation model (SEM) and hierarchical linear regression (HLR) analyses were conducted to examine all the considered research hypotheses. The results show that risk perception significantly affects perceived understanding and social distancing behaviors in a positive way. Perceived understanding has a significant positive correlation with social distancing behaviors and plays a mediating role in the relationship between risk perception and social distancing behaviors. Furthermore, safety climate positively predicts social distancing behaviors but lessens the positive correlation between risk perception and social distancing. Hence, these findings suggest effective management guidelines for successful implementation of the social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic by emphasizing the critical role of risk perception, perceived understanding, and safety climate.","Xie, Kefan; Liang, Benbu; Dulebenets, Maxim A; Mei, Yanlan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,245

To quickly respond to the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a nucleic acid-based vaccine is a novel option, beyond the traditional inactivated virus vaccine or recombinant protein vaccine. Here, we report a DNA vaccine containing the spike gene for delivery via electroporation. The spike genes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were codon optimized for mammalian cell expression and then cloned into mammalian cell expression vectors, called pSARS-S and pSARS2-S, respectively. Spike protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting after transient expression in HEK293T cells. After immunization, sera were collected for antigen-specific antibody and neutralizing antibody titer analyses. We found that both pSARS-S and pSARS2-S immunization induced similar levels of antibodies against S2 of SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, only pSARS2-S immunization induced antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. We further found that pSARS2-S immunization, but not pSARS-S immunization, could induce very high titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We further analyzed SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific T cell responses and found that the immune responses were biased toward Th1. Importantly, pSARS2-S immunization in hamsters could induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in vivo. These data suggest that DNA vaccination could be a promising approach for protecting against COVID-19.","Chai, Kit Man; Tzeng, Tsai-Teng; Shen, Kuan-Yin; Liao, Hung-Chun; Lin, Jhe-Jhih; Chen, Mei-Yu; Yu, Guann-Yi; Dou, Horng-Yunn; Liao, Ching-Len; Chen, Hsin-Wei; Liu, Shih-Jen",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,245
364008,Debating the Role of Vitamin D in COVID-19 – An interview with Dr. David Meltzer,2021,"The coronavirus pandemic could be the most threatening outbreak in the twenty-first century. According to the latest records of world health organization, more than 130 millions have been infected by COVID-19, with more than 2.9 million reported deaths. Yet, there is no magic cure for treatment of COVID-19. The concept of drug repurposing has been introduced as a fast, life-saving approach for drug discovery. Drug repurposing infers investigating already approved drugs for new indications, using the available information about pathophysiology of diseases and pharmacodynamics of drugs. In a recent work, more than 3000 FDA approved drugs were tested using virtual screening as potential antiviral agents for COVID-19. In this work, the top ranked five hits from the previous docking results together with drugs of similar chemical feature and/or mechanistic destinations were further tested using AutoDock Vina. The results showed that anti-HCV combinations could be potential therapeutic regimens for COVID-19 infections.

Understanding their effect is important, particularly in the context of standard epidemiological models, which require estimates for parameters such as $R_0$. In this letter, we show that the effective value of $R_0$ in super-spreader situations is significantly large, of the order of hundreds, suggesting a delta-function-like behavior during the event. Use of a well-mixed room model supports these findings. They elucidate infection kinetic modeling in enclosed environments, which differ from the standard SIR model, and provide expressions for $R_0$ in terms of physical and operational parameters. The overall impact of super-spreader events can be significant, depending on the state of the epidemic and how the infections generated by the event subsequently spread in the community.","Ramaswamy, Harisankar; Oberai, Assad A; Luhar, Mitul; Yortsos, Yannis C",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.02648v1.pdf,245

Each nurse has a story, and while these stories may have similar themes, they are all different. It is important to reflect on our stories, identify the myriad of emotions we are experiencing, and find ways to work through our feelings. Ignoring, denying, or suppressing feelings does not serve us well in the long run. Stifling negative emotions does not make them go away.

As the coronavirus outbreak began spreading, hospitals were forced to relocate resources to treat the growing number of COVID-19 patients. As a consequence, doctors across the country canceled tens of thousands of nonurgent surgeries. However, recognizing that the COVID-19 situation may be highly variable and fluid in different communities across the country, elective surgery could be still allowed in some centers for patients included in the high-priority class. The majority of endocrine disorders requiring surgical treatment in patients identifiable as first-priority class, or needing hospitalization within 30 days, are generally represented by malignant thyroid tumors, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and some adrenal disorders. The need for urgent intervention is evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to the severity of the symptoms, the likelihood of progression, and global clinical judgment. On the basis of the above indications, during the last 4 weeks, we performed 18 planned surgical treatments in patients with thyroid cancer (total thyroidectomies, plus lymph node dissection if needed) or multinodular toxic goiter. In no case, postoperative ventilatory support was needed, and the average hospital stay was 3 days. The negative COVID-19 status for all the treated patients was appropriately evaluated beforehand. Nobody knows how long the current COVID-19 pandemic will be lasting. Certainly, we will be requested in the next future to incrementally offer surgical services for endocrine disorders that have been deferred for the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lombardi, Celestino Pio; D039,; Amore, Annamaria; Grani, Giorgio; Ramundo, Valeria; Boscherini, Mauro; Gordini, Luca; Marzi, Federica; Tedesco, Silvia; Bocale, Raffaella",Endocrine,,245

Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test has been described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the standard test method for the diagnosis of the disease. However, considering that the results of this test are obtained between a few hours and two days, it is very important to apply another diagnostic method as an alternative to this test. The fact that RT-PCR test kits are limited in number, the test results are obtained in a long time, and the high probability of healthcare personnel becoming infected with the disease during the test, necessitates the use of other diagnostic methods as an alternative to these test kits. In this study, a hybrid model consisting of two-dimensional (2D) curvelet transformation, chaotic salp swarm algorithm (CSSA) and deep learning technique is developed in order to determine the patient infected with coronavirus pneumonia from X-ray images. In the proposed model, 2D Curvelet transformation is applied to the images obtained from the patient's chest X-ray radiographs and a feature matrix is formed using the obtained coefficients. The coefficients in the feature matrix are optimized with the help of the CSSA and COVID-19 disease is diagnosed by the EfficientNet-B0 model, which is one of the deep learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid model can diagnose COVID-19 disease with high accuracy from chest X-ray images.","Altan, Aytaç; Karasu, Seçkin",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,245

381148,Learner Driven Call Center to increase Convalescent Plasma Donation in COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Lab companies developed serology tests for antibody detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) with United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization. Antibody detection uses purified proteins of SARS-CoV-2 to determine antibody binding via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), or colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic assay. With the advent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), nucleic acid amplification technology (NAAT) SARS-CoV-2 testing for active infection was not widely available to healthy, active-duty Soldiers. The purpose of this surveillance survey was to determine the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms of COVID-19 within a mechanized infantry brigade. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Active-duty military Servicemembers (= 18 years) from a mechanized infantry brigade provided serum samples for testing for the Elecsys R Anti-SARS-CoV-2 qualitative antibody test from June to September 2020 at Joint Base Lewis McChord (JBLM). In addition, participants filled out a questionnaire for symptoms and exposure to COVID-19 from January to September 2020. The surveillance team collected and analyzed antibody testing results and questionnaires from participants for antibody positivity rates and symptom prevalence. RESULTS: A total of 264 participants were tested, with one (0.4%) participant testing positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody. On the questionnaire, 144 of 264 (54.5%) endorsed symptoms of COVID-19 from January to September 2020. The most common symptoms were headache (35%), rhinorrhea (34%), cough (35%), and sore throat (31%). A total of 31 respondents (12%) had been quarantined as a trace contact to a COVID-19 positive patient. CONCLUSIONS: While there are limitations inherent to SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and the survey, prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is low. In this sample, symptoms for COVID-19 were prevalent with significant days of duty lost. Prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in this sample may be generalizable to the larger brigade. Prevalence of symptoms of possible COVID-19 are not generalizable to the larger brigade. There is utility to further studies of SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in military populations for purposes of vaccination triaging and deployment readiness.","Koo, A. Y.; Rodgers, D. K.; Johnson, K.

Such patients are usually treated with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive agents, which may tamper with the organism's normal response to infections. Currently, no consensus has been reached on how to manage MS and NMOSD patients during the pandemic. Objective: To discuss strategies to manage those patients. Methods: We focus on how to 1) reduce COVID-19 infection risk, such as social distancing, telemedicine, and wider interval between laboratory testing/imaging; 2) manage relapses, such as avoiding treatment of mild relapse and using oral steroids; 3) manage disease-modifying therapies, such as preference for drugs associated with lower infection risk (interferons, glatiramer, teriflunomide, and natalizumab) and extended-interval dosing of natalizumab, when safe; 4) individualize the chosen MS induction-therapy (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, alemtuzumab, and cladribine); 5) manage NMOSD preventive therapies, including initial therapy selection and current treatment maintenance; 6) manage MS/NMOSD patients infected with COVID-19.

Objetivo: Estudiar la relación de la letalidad y mortalidad con variables sociales, demográficas, económicas y de salud más relevantes durante los primeros 90 días de la pandemia en 60 países del mundo de los cuatro continentes. Material y métodos : Estudio transversal descriptivo y analítico de casos. Los casos lo conformaron 60 países seleccionados según la magnitud de su afectación por Covid 19. La mortalidad y la letalidad fueron estratificadas y se contrastaron con las variables de los países seleccionados mediante comparación de medias. Resultados: Se encontró una fuerte correlación entre la mortalidad y letalidad (r=0,70). El día en que se inició la enfermedad en un país y su crecimiento de infectados mostraron diferencias entre países: aquellos con mejores indicadores económicos e índice de desarrollo humano, tuvieron menos letalidad al inicio de la enfermedad. Al aumentar la incidencia, estas diferencias desaparecieron. Conclusión: Los resultados sugieren que al inicio de la enfermedad en un país, los mejores servicios son importantes, pero luego cuando la enfermedad ya se expandió, la incidencia es la variable más importante. Este resultado mostró que no hay recursos sanitarios que puedan disminuir la letalidad, independiente de cualquier otra característica del país afectado.","Zevallos, Javier Cieza; Uriol Lescano, Celene",Rev. méd. hered,,245

The Misappropriation of COVID-19 Related TV Ad Expenditures,2020,This study investigates whether a machine-learning-based system can predict the rate of cognitive-decline in mildly cognitively impaired (MCI) patients by processing only the clinical and imaging data collected at the initial visit. We build a predictive model based on a supervised hybrid neural network utilizing a 3-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network to perform volume analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and integration of non-imaging clinical data at the fully connected layer of the architecture. The analysis is performed on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Experimental results confirm that there is a correlation between cognitive decline and the data obtained at the first visit. The system achieved an area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 66.6% for cognitive decline class prediction.,"Candemir, Sema; Nguyen, Xuan V.; Prevedello, Luciano M.; Bigelow, Matthew T.; D.White, Richard; Erdal, Barbaros S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10034v1.pdf,245

Methods: Due to time constraints and the acute nature of the pandemic, we searched only PubMed/Medline from inception until January 28, 2021. We analyzed the level of evidence and risk of bias in each category and made suggestions accordingly. Results: The virus was traced from its potential origin via possible ways of transmission to the last host. Symptomatic human-to-human transmission remains the driver of the epidemic, but asymptomatic transmission can potentially contribute in a substantial manner. Feces and fomites have both been found to contain viable virus;even though transmission through these routes has not been documented, their contribution cannot be ruled out. Finally, transmission from pregnant women to their children has been found to be low (up to 3%). Conclusion: Even though robust outcomes cannot be easily assessed, medical personnel must maintain awareness of the main routes of transmission (via droplets and aerosols from even asymptomatic patients). This is the first attempt to systematically review the existing knowledge to produce a paper with a potentially significant clinical impact.","Mourmouris, P.; Tzelves, L.; Roidi, C.; Fotsali, A.",Osong Public Health &amp; Research Perspectives,,245

BACKGROUND: During the COVID19-pandemic, both media, politicians and the public have supported and cheered on the frontline healthcare workers around the world. We have found the hero narrative to be potentially problematic for both nurses and other healthcare workers. This paper presents an analysis and discussion of the consequences of being proclaimed a hero. DESIGN: Hospital ethnography including fieldwork and focus groups. METHOD: Empirical data was collected in a newly opened COVID19-ward in a university hospital in the urban site of Copenhagen, Denmark. Fieldwork was performed from April until the ward closed in the end of May 2020. Succeeding focus group interviews with nursing staff who worked in the COVID19-ward were conducted in June 2020. The data were abductively analysed. RESULTS: The nursing staff rejected the hero narrative in ways that show how the hero narrative leads to predefined characteristics, ideas of being invincible and self-sacrificing, knowingly and willingly working in risk, transcending duties and imbodying a boundless identity. Being proclaimed as a hero inhibits important discussions of rights and boundaries. CONCLUSION: The hero narrative strips the responsibility of the politicians and imposes it onto the hospitals and the individual heroic health care worker. IMPACT: It is our agenda to show how the hero narrative detaches the connection between the politicians, society and healthcare system despite being a political apparatus. When reassessing contingency plans, it is important to incorporate the experiences from the health care workers and include their rights and boundaries. Finally, we urge the media to cover a long-lasting pandemic without having the hero narrative as the reigning filter.","Halberg, Nina; Jensen, Pia Søe; Larsen, Trine Schifter",J Adv Nurs,,245

A few studies discussed the outcome of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients. This short series demonstrates our experience in managing COVID-19 disease in renal transplant patients in the absence of strong evidence. We report 8 cases of kidney transplant recipients infected with COVID-19 (median age = 48.5 years; range = 21-71 years), including 4 males and 4 females. The most frequently associated comorbidity was hypertension. The most common presenting features were fever and cough. The main radiological investigation was a portable chest X-ray. Other common features included lymphopenia, high C-reactive protein, and a very high ferritin level. Overall, 1 patient was managed as an outpatient, the remaining 7 required hospital admission, 1 of them referred to the intensive therapy unit. Management included supportive treatment (intravenous fluid therapy, monitoring renal function, and symptomatic treatment with or without ward-based oxygen therapy depending on oxygen saturation) and discontinuation of the antiproliferative immunosuppressive drugs. Seven patients recovered and discharged home to self-isolate. One patient required intensive care treatment and mechanical ventilation. Supportive treatment could be sufficient for the management or to be tried first. We also found that short hospital stay with self-isolation on discharge reduces the burden on the health service and protect the staff and the public.","Elhadedy, Muhammed Ahmed; Marie, Yazin; Halawa, Ahmed",Nephron,,245

This achievement is not attainable, however, particularly after the 2020 pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019. Consequently, the more realistic objective of eliminating HCV from population segments for which targeted strategies of prevention and treatment are easily attained has been promoted in Europe, as a valid alternative. The underlying idea is that micro-elimination will ultimately lead to macro-elimination. The micro-elimination strategy may target different specific populations and at-risk groups. Different settings, including prisons and hospitals, have also been identified as micro-elimination scenarios. In addition, dedicated micro-elimination strategies have been designed that are tailored at the geographical level according to HCV epidemiology and individual country's income. The main elements of a valid and successful micro-elimination project are reliable epidemiological data and active involvement of all the stakeholders.

RESULTS: 73 out of 334 program directors responded. 49.3% were located in the Northeast, 16.4% in the Southeast, 16.4% in the Midwest, 12.3% in the Southwest, and 5.5% in the Pacific. Community programs made up 16.4% of respondents, while academic programs made up 76.7%. 6.8% identified as ""other"". 98.6% agreed with the provided definition of HCD. 83.6% agreed or strongly agreed that HCD present an obstacle to providing imaging care. 74.0% agreed or strongly agreed that HCD education is an essential component of residency training. However, 74.0% agreed or strongly agreed that HCD education is difficult to implement due to competing educational requirements. Only 16.4% agreed or strongly agreed that they had sufficient material on HCD to train residents. CONCLUSION: Although many radiology residency programs agree that HCD education is essential in residency training, the majority feel that a curriculum is difficult to implement and that they lack sufficient resources. This study confirms the need to address this gap with a standardized curriculum which has been developed and is discussed.","Song, Alexander; Americo, Lisa; Myers, Hannah; DeBenedectis, Carolynn; Slanetz, Priscilla J; Sarkany, David",Acad. radiol,,245
397737,COVID-19 in hospitalized adults with HIV,2020,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 has caused tremendous suffering and huge economic losses. We hypothesized that extreme measures of partial-to-total shutdown might have influenced the quality of the global environment because of decreased emissions of atmospheric pollutants. We tested this hypothesis using satellite imagery, climatic datasets (temperature, and absolute humidity), and COVID-19 cases available in the public domain. While the majority of the cases were recorded from Western countries, where mortality rates were strongly positively correlated with age, the number of cases in tropical regions was relatively lower than European and North American regions, possibly attributed to faster human-to-human transmission. There was a substantial reduction in the level of nitrogen dioxide (NO2: 0.00002 mol m-2), a low reduction in CO (<0.03 mol m-2), and a low-to-moderate reduction in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD: ~0.1-0.2) in the major hotspots of COVID-19 outbreak during February-March 2020, which may be attributed to the mass lockdowns. Our study projects an increasing coverage of high COVID-19 hazard at absolute humidity levels ranging from 4 to 9 g m-3 across a large part of the globe during April-July 2020 due to a high prospective meteorological suitability for COVID-19 spread. Our findings suggest that there is ample scope for restoring the global environment from the ill-effects of anthropogenic activities through temporary shutdown measures.","Lal, Preet; Kumar, Amit; Kumar, Shubham; Kumari, Sheetal; Saikia, Purabi; Dayanandan, Arun; Adhikari, Dibyendu; Khan, M L",Sci Total Environ,,245

However, the infection spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 and its comprehensive protein-level interactions with hosts remain unclear. There is a massive amount of under-utilized data and knowledge about RNA viruses highly relevant to SARS-CoV-2 and proteins of their hosts. More in-depth and more comprehensive analyses of that knowledge and data can shed new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the COVID-19 pandemic and reveal potential risks. In this work, we constructed a multi-layer virus-host interaction network to incorporate these data and knowledge. We developed a machine learning-based method to predict virus-host interactions at both protein and organism levels. Our approach revealed five potential infection targets of SARS-CoV-2 and 19 highly possible interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins in the innate immune pathway.","Du, Hangyu; Chen, Feng; Liu, Hongfu; Hong, Pengyu",Patterns (N Y),,245
398022,Intracranial Hypertension in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children,2021,"The world continues in the grip of COVID-19 with devastated tourism industries and global economies. In a previous paper, it was noted that a country's failure to dampen a first wave of infection or the recurrence of a second wave would serve as disincentives for greatly needed tourists in summer 2020 and would further significantly reduce tourism revenues and potentially accelerate job losses and bankruptcies in affected countries. Countries in the first wave of infection would need to restrain COVID-19 spread swiftly in order to benefit from summer 2020 tourism. Countries that had controlled COVID-19 and who experienced second waves would manifest the same negative effects. In the case of Malta, up to the beginning of July, the country had the lowest COVID-19 numbers in Europe but this ended abruptly when two mass events took place. In a fortnight, the steep escalation of cases led to a downgrade of the country's status to a high-risk destination, with a host of European countries enacting quarantine measures. The Maltese government re-imposed restrictions and COVID-19 numbers slowly started to temporarily decline. As an economy, Malta is highly dependent on the tourism industry, with approximately 17% of GDP reliant on this sector, directly and indirectly. Malta's red listing wrought a heavy toll on the industry. The World Health Organisation has mandated clear criteria for the release of restrictions and this sequence of events should serve as a cautionary tale: heed the advice of our public health colleagues.","Grech, Victor; Cuschieri, Sarah; Balzan, Martin; Grech, Peter; Fabri, Stephanie; Gauci, Charmaine",Early Hum Dev,,245

The CAS was translated into the Bangla language following the International Test Commission's guidelines for this adaptation study and placed in an online survey (N = 737, with a mean age of 26.55 (SD = 7.166 years) to assess the psychometric properties of the Bangla version of the scale. Results suggested that all items had a good item discrimination index and single-factor structure with good factor loadings. The CAS Bangla version was found to have good internal consistency reliabilities, test-retest reliability, and composite reliability (&#8805; 0.7). The measurement invariance suggested invariances across age groups and gender. The CAS Bangla version showed a high correlation to the anxiety subscale of the short form of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) and a moderate correlation to the depression subscale of the DASS-21 and the COVID-19 Worry Scale.

407243,Mobility and COVID-19 mortality across Scandinavia: A modeling study,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection has drastically impacted the transplant communities. Remdesivir (RDV) has shown some promising results in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) albeit with low certainty. Data in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) are still lacking. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort of 57 moderate to severe COVID-19 positive KTR in a single center who received RDV as a part of COVID-19 management. No dose adjustments were done. The outcomes were measured as acute kidney injury (AKI) recovery; liver function tests abnormalities; other side effects; graft loss and death. RESULTS: The median (inter-quartile range) age of presentation was 44 (31-51) years. The duration from onset of symptoms to RDV initiation was 6 (5-7) days. Thirty-two (56%) cases received RDV on the day of admission. Forty-six (81%) cases were on oxygen support upon initiation of RDV. Thirty-eight (66.6%) cases had acute kidney injury on admission. The median baseline, admission, and 28-day follow-up serum creatinine of the cohort were 1.59 (1.1-2.1), 2.13 (1.3-3.1), and 1.58 (1.05-2.1) mg/dl, respectively. A total of 8(14%) cases died in the study with 1 (1.7%) graft loss. All those cases that died were on oxygen therapy at the time of initiation of RDV. No liver function derangements or any other major adverse events with the drug were reported. CONCLUSION: RDV therapy is safe and clinically feasible in renal transplant recipients as seen in our cohort. Larger clinical registries and randomized clinical trials should be conducted to further explore the efficacy in transplant recipients.","Meshram, Hari S; Kute, Vivek B; Patel, Himanshu; Banerjee, Subho; Navadiya, Vijay; Desai, Sudeep; Rizvi, Syed J; Mishra, Vineet; Chauhan, Sanshriti",Transpl Infect Dis,,245

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Three merged data sources from a large United States health plan: a large national administrative claims database, an outpatient laboratory testing database, and an inpatient hospital admissions database. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 18-65 with continuous enrollment in the health plan from January 2019 to the date of a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three comparator groups, matched by propensity score, to individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2: a 2020 comparator group, an historical 2019 comparator group, and an historical comparator group with viral lower respiratory tract illness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: More than 50 clinical sequelae after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection (defined as the date of first SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (index date) plus 21 days) were identified using ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) codes. Excess risk in the four months after acute infection and hazard ratios with Bonferroni corrected 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: 14% of adults aged &#8804;65 who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (27 074 of 193 113) had at least one new type of clinical sequelae that required medical care after the acute phase of the illness, which was 4.95% higher than in the 2020 comparator group. The risk for specific new sequelae attributable to SARS-Cov-2 infection after the acute phase, including chronic respiratory failure, cardiac arrythmia, hypercoagulability, encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, amnesia (memory difficulty), diabetes, liver test abnormalities, myocarditis, anxiety, and fatigue, was significantly greater than in the three comparator groups (2020, 2019, and viral lower respiratory tract illness groups) (all P<0.001). Significant risk differences because of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from 0.02 to 2.26 per 100 people (all P<0.001), and hazard ratios ranged from 1.24 to 25.65 compared with the 2020 comparator group. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the excess risk of developing new clinical sequelae after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including specific types of sequelae less commonly seen in other viral illnesses. Although individuals who were older, had pre-existing conditions, and were admitted to hospital because of covid-19 were at greatest excess risk, younger adults (aged &#8804;50), those with no pre-existing conditions, or those not admitted to hospital for covid-19 also had an increased risk of developing new clinical sequelae. The greater risk for incident sequelae after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection is relevant for healthcare planning.","Daugherty, Sarah E; Guo, Yinglong; Heath, Kevin; Dasmariñas, Micah C; Jubilo, Karol Giuseppe; Samranvedhya, Jirapat; Lipsitch, Marc; Cohen, Ken",BMJ,,245

418814,476. Gilead Sciences’ Commitment to the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"By collecting photons scattered out of the therapy beam, scatter imaging creates images of the treated volume. Two phantoms were used to assess the possible application of scatter imaging for markerless tracking of lung tumors during stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatment. A scatter-imaging camera was assembled with a CsI flat-panel detector and a 5 mm diameter pinhole collimator. Scatter images were collected during the irradiation of phantoms with megavoltage photons. To assess scatter image quality, spherical phantom lung tumors of 2.1 - 2.8 cm diameters were placed inside a static, anthropomorphic phantom. To show the efficacy of the technique with a moving target (3 cm diameter), the position of a simulated tumor was tracked in scatter images during sinusoidal motion (15 mm amplitude, 0.25 Hz frequency) in a dynamic lung phantom in open-field, dynamic conformal arc (DCA), and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) deliveries. Anatomical features are identifiable on static phantom scatter images collected with 10 MU of delivered dose (2.1 cm diameter lung tumor contrast-to-noise ratio of 4.4). The contrast-to-noise ratio increases with tumor size and delivered dose. During dynamic motion, the position of the 3.0 cm diameter lung tumor was identified with a root-mean-square error of 0.8, 1.2, and 2.9 mm for open field (0.3 s frame integration), DCA (0.5 s), and VMAT (0.5 s), respectively. Based on phantom studies, scatter imaging is a potential technique for markerless lung tumor tracking during SBRT without additional imaging dose. Quality scatter images may be collected at low, clinically relevant doses (10 MU). Scatter images are capable of sub-millimeter tracking precision, but modulation decreases accuracy.","Jones, Kevin C; Turian, Julius V; Redler, Gage; Cifter, Gizem; Strologas, John; Templeton, Alistair; Bernard, Damian; Chu, James C H",Phys. med. biol,,245

To examine this phenomenon, this study compared the sedentary behavior (SB) of Thai adults before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. The 2019 and 2020 datasets of Thailand's Surveillance on Physical Activity (SPA) were employed. A total of 5379 (SPA2019) and 6531 (SPA202020) persons age 18-64 years who had access to the Internet were included in the analysis. Measures imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19 infection were significantly associated with lower opportunity of Thai adults for work-related physical movement, and that increased their SB, particularly with the shift from onsite to online working platforms. Cumulative SB increased from 824 (before the pandemic) to 875 min/day during the pandemic. The odds of accumulating &gt;13 h/day of SB was highest among females, young adults, those who completed post-secondary education, unemployed or working in the non-agriculture sector, having a chronic disease/condition, residing in an urban area, and living in a 'higher-risk' pandemic zone. The insignificant association of physical activity (PA) and the Fit from Home (FFH) intervention in reducing SB during the pandemic suggests that PA is not directly associated with SB, and that the FFH intervention was insufficient to prevent SB.","Katewongsa, P.; Potharin, D.; Rasri, N.; Palakai, R.; Widyastari, D.

Methods: We conducted an online sociodemographic and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) survey during the second phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Mexico to evaluate the presence of psychological distress, signs of post-traumatic stress, and to identify the groups at highest risk in the sample. Results: Prevalence of psychological distress at moderate or severe levels in the sample were as follows: 943 (22%) intrusive thoughts, 933 (22.3%) avoidance, and 515 (12.2%) hyperarousal. Furthermore, we found the symptoms of clinically significant post-traumatic stress in 1160 (27.7%) of the participants. The variables positively correlated with higher psychological distress were as follows: age (younger), sex (female), employment (employed), relationship status (single), in social isolation, number of days in isolation, the number of people in the household (3-5), and a perception of a high risk of contracting COVID-19, change in routine, engaging in less activity, and loss of income. Conclusion: During phase 2 of the COVID-19 outbreak in Mexico, we observed the presence of psychological distress and post-traumatic stress symptoms in over a quarter of the population. This investigation may guide mental health interventions and policies towards the groups that are most vulnerable to the impacts of the social and lifestyle changes taking place in Mexico due to COVID-19.","González Ramírez, Leivy Patricia; Martínez Arriaga, Reyna Jazmín; Hernández-Gonzalez, Martha Alicia; De la Roca-Chiapas, José María",Psychol Res Behav Manag,,245

423702,Epidemic Management with Admissible and Robust Invariant Sets,2021-09-13,"OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this revision is to summarize the current existing evidence of the potential adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the male reproductive system and provide the recommendations of the Asociación Española de Andrología, Medicina Sexual y Reproductiva (ASESA) concerning the implications of COVID-19 infection in the management of male infertilty patients and testicular endocrine dysfunction. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search of the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Medline, Cochrane and MedRxiv, was carried out. RESULTS: The presence of orchitis as a potential complication of the infection by SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed. One study reported that 19% of males with COVID-19 infection had scrotal symptoms suggestive of viral orchitis which could not be confirmed. It is possible that the virus, rather than infecting the testes directly, may induce a secondary autoimmune response leading to autoimmune orchitis. COVID-19 has been associated with coagulation disorders and thus the orchitis could be the result of segmental vasculitis. Existing data concerning the presence of the virus in semen are contradictory. Only one study reported the presence of RNA in 15.8% of patients with COVID-19. However, the presence of nucleic acid or antigen in semen is not synonyms of viral replication capacity and infectivity. It has been reported an increase in serum levels of LH in males with COVID-19 and a significant reduction in the T/LH and FSH/LH ratios, consistent with subclinical hypogonadism. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of recent reports related to the potential effects of COVID-19 infection on the male reproductive system are based on poorly designed, small sample size studies that provide inconclusive, contradictory results. Since there still exists a theoretical possibility of testicular damage and male infertilty as a result of the infection by COVID-19, males of reproductive age should be evaluated for gonadal function and semen analysis. With regard to the sexual transmission of the virus, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend asymptomatic couples to abstein from having sex in order to protect themselves from being infected by the virus. Additional studies are needed to understand the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproductive function, including male fertility potential and endocrine testicular function.","José, Ferran García; González, Juan G Álvarez; Molina, Juan Manuel Corral; Arnau, Lluis Bassas; Iribarren, Ignacio Moncada; Jabaloyas, José Maria Martínez; Rico, Fernando Meijide; García-Baquero, Rodrigo; Gayá, Mariano Rosselló; García, Enrique Lledó; López, Carmen Luque; Castro, Rafael Prieto; Salamanca, Juan Ignacio Martinez",Rev Int Androl,,245

A national cross-sectional survey among 1205 adults was conducted in April 2020 in Greece. Multivariable ordered logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between COVID-19 related attitudes and knowledge and adoption of preventive behaviors, controlling for socioeconomic and health-related characteristics. A total of 923 individuals fully completed the survey. Individuals who believed that the virus is out of control, is transmitted through the air, and is not similar to the common flu were more likely to adopt public health preventive behaviors more frequently, particularly wearing masks in public spaces, washing their hands, and spending fewer hours out of their homes. Uncertainty about the virus symptomatology was associated with less frequent mask-wearing and handwashing. Increased social support, frequent media use for COVID-19 updates, trust to authorities, older age, worse health status, female gender and being a healthcare professional were also associated with uptake of some preventive health behaviors. Attitudinal and socioeconomic determinants critically affect public engagement in preventive behaviors. Health policy initiatives should focus on community outreach approaches to raise awareness and to strengthen social support mechanisms by integrating multiple stakeholders.","Souliotis, Kyriakos; Giannouchos, Theodoros V; Peppou, Lily E; Samara, Myrto T; Nimatoudis, John; Papageorgiou, Charalambos; Economou, Marina",Inquiry,,245
427634,Impact of Rapid Transition to Telemedicine-Based Delivery on Allergy/Immunology Care During COVID-19,2021,"The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a candidate vaccine antigen that binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), leading to virus entry. Here, it is shown that rapid conversion of recombinant RBD into particulate form via admixing with liposomes containing cobalt-porphyrin-phospholipid (CoPoP) potently enhances the functional antibody response. Antigen binding via His-tag insertion into the CoPoP bilayer results in a serum-stable and conformationally intact display of the RBD on the liposome surface. Compared to other vaccine formulations, immunization using CoPoP liposomes admixed with recombinant RBD induces multiple orders of magnitude higher levels of antibody titers in mice that neutralize pseudovirus cell entry, block RBD interaction with ACE2, and inhibit live virus replication. Enhanced immunogenicity can be accounted for by greater RBD uptake into antigen-presenting cells in particulate form and improved immune cell infiltration in draining lymph nodes. QS-21 inclusion in the liposomes results in an enhanced antigen-specific polyfunctional T cell response. In mice, high dose immunization results in minimal local reactogenicity, is well-tolerated, and does not elevate serum cobalt levels. Taken together, these results confirm that particulate presentation strategies for the RBD immunogen should be considered for inducing strongly neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2.","Huang, Wei-Chiao; Zhou, Shiqi; He, Xuedan; Chiem, Kevin; Mabrouk, Moustafa T; Nissly, Ruth H; Bird, Ian M; Strauss, Mike; Sambhara, Suryaprakash; Ortega, Joaquin; Wohlfert, Elizabeth A; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; Kuchipudi, Suresh V; Davidson, Bruce A; Lovell, Jonathan F",Adv Mater,,245

Historical evidence suggests that Lupus patients have a higher incidence of several viral infections. This is likely due to a combination of immune dysfunction, immunosuppressive therapy and excess co-morbidities. In this context there has been concern that Lupus patients may be at a higher risk of developing COVID-19 and suffering a severe disease course. As a result, many Lupus patients have been advised to 'shield' by isolating from social contact in the hope that this will reduce the likelihood of infection. Early clinical data does not appear to show that the incidence of COVID-19 is higher in Lupus patients. Reassuringly, the clinical course of COVID-19 in Lupus does not generally seem to be more severe than in the general population. There has been huge interest in repurposing existing drugs as potential treatments, including several used to treat Lupus. Of these, corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine are the most well researched so far. The current evidence suggests that the corticosteroid dexamethasone improves outcome for the sickest COVID-19 patients requiring respiratory support. Initial reports suggested that hydroxychloroquine could have a positive impact on the course of COVID-19, however larger prospective studies have not supported this. Janus kinase inhibitors, currently being investigated for efficacy in lupus, have been shown to have anti-viral effects in vitro and inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway may dampen down the host hyper-inflammatory response. Several trials are ongoing to assess the outcome of the use of JAK inhibitors in COVID-19 positive patients. For most patients continuing with their existing therapies to prevent a lupus flare or adverse events associated with sudden corticosteroid withdrawal is important whilst an Individualised risk assessment remains vital.","Mason, Alice; Rose, Emily; Edwards, Christopher J",Lupus,,245

Microbiologic Characterization and Antibacterial Use in Hospitalized Adults with covid-19 Infection,2020,"The new pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a wide range of clinical consequences, from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory failure and it is very heterogeneous. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is well recognized as a key regulating system in circulatory homeostasis that play prominent roles in pathophysiological processes in abnormal activation for instance renal and cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and stroke. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2) as a component of the RAS system. However, unlike the ACE, its activity is not inhibited by the ACE inhibitors. The major product of ACE2 is Ang1-7, known as a vasodilator peptide and part of the depressant arm of the RAS. There are two form of ACE2. Coronavirus cover with some proteins in order to help viral attachment to the cell membrane ACE2 as a receptor and then fuse and enter the cells. ACE2 was expressed in oral Cavity, salivary glands of the mouth, esophagus, myocardial cells, kidney, and enterocytes, along all the respiratory tract, intestine, and blood vessels. In this article, we explain the renin-angiotensin system and its components. Also, we shortly explain the organs involved in COVID-19 disease and we will talk about the possible causes of damage to these organs. We also reviewed the probable mechanism of using ACE2 in viral attachment and the probable treatment processes will also be discussed based on the surface proteins of the virus and ACE2. In addition, we briefly discuss the anti-angiotensin drugs and why patients with chronic disease are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection and show worse progression.","Kenarkoohi, Azra; Maleki, Maryam; Safari, Tahereh; Kafashian, Mohamadreza; Saljoughi, Fateme; Sohrabipour, Shahla",Current hypertension reviews (Online),,245
437114,Navigating hospitals safely through the COVID-19 epidemic tide: predicting case load for adjusting bed capacity,2020,"Plants are a rich source of new antiviral, pharmacologically active agents. The naturally occurring plant alkaloid berberine (BBR) is one of the phytochemicals with a broad range of biological activity, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity. BBR targets different steps in the viral life cycle and is thus a good candidate for use in novel antiviral drugs and therapies. It has been shown that BBR reduces virus replication and targets specific interactions between the virus and its host. BBR intercalates into DNA and inhibits DNA synthesis and reverse transcriptase activity. It inhibits replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This isoquinoline alkaloid has the ability to regulate the MEK-ERK, AMPK/mTOR, and NF-&#954;B signaling pathways, which are necessary for viral replication. Furthermore, it has been reported that BBR supports the host immune response, thus leading to viral clearance. In this short review, we focus on the most recent studies on the antiviral properties of berberine and its derivatives, which might be promising agents to be considered in future studies in the fight against the current pandemic SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.","Warowicka, Alicja; Nawrot, Robert; Gozdzicka-Józefiak, Anna",Arch Virol,,245

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the early results and feasibility of surgeries for bone sarcomas during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: Our prospectively collected orthopaedic oncological database was reviewed to include two groups of patients- those who underwent surgery in the immediate 4 weeks before lockdown (non-lockdown group) and those operated in the first 4 weeks of lockdown (lockdown group). All patients were followed-up clinically and telephonically to collect the outcome data. RESULTS: Out of the 91 patients who qualified for inclusion, fifty were classified into the non-lockdown group while 41 patients formed the lockdown group. Both the groups were comparable with respect to baseline demographic parameters. However, during the lockdown period 37 patients (90%) had undergone a major surgical intervention as against 24 patients (48%) in the non-lockdown group (P < .001). There was no significant difference in type of anaesthesia, median estimated blood loss and procedure duration. None of the patients/health care workers had evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 infection at 15 days follow-up.

We investigated the safety and feasibility of fluoroscopy-guided nasojejunal (NJ) feeding tube placement in the prone position. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent fluoroscopic placement of NJ feeding tubes at a single institution between March 2020 and December 2020. Primary end points were success rate and number of attempts. Chi-squared and Fischer exact tests were used to compare prone and supine groups. RESULTS: A total of 210 patients were included in the study: 53 patients received NJ feeding tubes while prone and 157 while supine. All but one patient in the prone group had ARDS secondary to COVID-19, whereas 47 (30.3%) had COVID-19 in the supine group. The rate of successful placement was 94.3% in the prone group and 100% in the supine group. Mean number of attempts was 1.1 (SD, ±0.4) in the prone and 1.0 (SD, ±0.1) in the supine group (P = .14). Prone patients had a longer median fluoroscopy time (69 s, interquartile range [IQR] = 92; vs 48 s, IQR = 43; P < .001) and received a higher radiation dose during the procedure (47 mGy, IQR = 50; vs 25 mGy, IQR = 33; P = .004). No procedural complications were reported. CONCLUSION: Fluoroscopy-guided NJ feeding tube placement in prone patients is feasible and safe.

Owing to the side effects of chemical disinfectants, there is an increasing need for knowledge on the use of virucidal compounds, especially those of a natural origin. Climacostol is a molecule produced by a freshwater ciliate and it exhibits activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens. We thus also speculated that there might be an effect on viral viability, which has never been tested. To evaluate such activity, we chose human adenovirus (HAdV), which is representative of waterborne viruses. We conducted experiments using HAdV serotype 5, whose titer was determined by infecting HeLa cell cultures. HAdV5 was shown to be sensitive to climacostol at a concentration of 0.0002 mg/mL, with an approximate 3 Log10 reduction when the initial titer of HAdV5 was approximately 104 and 103 TCID50/mL. These preliminary results could be an important starting point for further research aimed at improving the characterization of climacostol activity under different experimental conditions and against various viruses, including enveloped ones (i.e., the coronavirus). The production of climacostol by a protist living in fresh water also suggests a possible application in the activated sludge of wastewater treatment plants.","Verani, Marco; Di Giuseppe, Graziano; Federigi, Ileana; Buonanno, Federico; Ortenzi, Claudio; Carducci, Annalaura",Viruses,,245

Such rapid spread is predominantly attributed to the poor diagnosis and its asymptomatic transmission. In the absence of treatment regime, timely diagnosis is the best available remedy that can restrict its spread. An early diagnosis of COVID-19 is critical for determining the line of treatment and preventing long term complications in the infected subject. Unfortunately, available rapid antigen and antibody kits are known to be erroneous whereas RT-PCR based tests are expensive, viral load dependent and at times inconclusive. In current scenario, the false-negative results imposed a major risk to the individual patient care and also to the efforts for containing the spread at the population level, where as false positives are traumatic for families and can lead to improper treatment resulting in severe complications.

Numerous studies have evaluated bitcoin's safe-haven properties during the COVID-19; however, the present study considered gold as a potential safe-haven for investors of renowned stock markets of Asia, Europe, and the US. The present investigation computed the ratio of gold to bitcoin (Gold_Bitcoin) and compared the safe-haven properties of gold in contrast to bitcoin. The present study analysed the Morlet Wavelet approach and found that most of the time during the COVID-19, gold investments proved to be more beneficial than bitcoin. Remarkably, the findings highlighted that the Gold_Bitcoin ratio increased in higher and lower frequencies combined with CAC40. In the long run, the return on investments in gold increased in contrast to bitcoin returns pooled with DAX30. Also, the Gold_Bitcoin ratio of the US stock market increased during the one-week and one-month cycles of January and August. Likewise, the Hang Seng Index caused the Gold_Bitcoin ratio to rise at a much higher frequency (i.e., the second half of January, the first half of February and April, and the first half of June and August), whereas IBEX35 surged Gold_Bitcoin at a lower frequency (i.e., during January, February, and August). In higher frequency bands, LSE increased the Gold_Bitcoin ratio (i.e., in February and March); nevertheless, Gold_Bitcoin showed a positive connection with FTSEMIB in the one-to-two month's frequency band (i.e., throughout January, February, and August).

Carer themes included: 1. concern over provision of professional support for patients; 2. increased practical demands placed on carers in lockdown; 3. managing new challenges around patient wellbeing; 4. new opportunities. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced access to ED services, loss of routine and heightened anxieties and ED symptoms resulting from COVID-19 and lockdown measures presented challenges for patients and carers. Increased remote support by ED services enabled the continuation of treatment and self-management resources and strategies promoted self-efficacy in both groups.","Clark Bryan, Danielle; Macdonald, Pamela; Ambwani, Suman; Cardi, Valentina; Rowlands, Katie; Willmott, Daniel; Treasure, Janet",,,245

465935,Exercise and Fitness in the Age of Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Using the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (\textsc{Flares}) we explore the dust driven properties of massive high-redshift galaxies at $z\in[5,10]$. By post-processing the galaxy sample using the radiative transfer code \textsc{skirt} we obtain the full spectral energy distribution. We explore the resultant luminosity functions, IRX-$\beta$ relations as well as the luminosity-weighted dust temperatures in the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR). We find that most of our results are in agreement with the current set of observations, but under-predict the number densities of bright IR galaxies, which are extremely biased towards the most overdense regions. We see that the \textsc{Flares} IRX-$\beta$ relation (for $5\le z\le8$) predominantly follows the local starburst relation. The IRX shows an increase with stellar mass, plateauing at the high-mass end ($\sim10^{10}$M$_{\odot}$) and shows no evolution in the median normalisation with redshift. We also look at the dependence of the peak dust temperature (T$_{\mathrm{peak}}$) on various galaxy properties including the stellar mass, IR luminosity and sSFR, finding the correlation to be strongest with sSFR. The luminosity-weighted dust temperatures increase towards higher redshifts, with the slope of the T$_{\mathrm{peak}}$ - redshift relation showing a higher slope than the lower redshift relations obtained from previous observational and theoretical works. The results from \textsc{Flares}, which is able to provide a better statistical sample of high-redshift galaxies compared to other simulations, provides a distinct vantage point for the high-redshift Universe.","Vijayan, Aswin P.; Wilkins, Stephen M.; Lovell, Christopher C.; Thomas, Peter A.; Camps, Peter; Baes, Maarten; Trayford, James; Kuusisto, Jussi; Roper, William J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.00830v1.pdf,245

Malta has one large acute general hospital, Mater Dei (MDH). This study retrospectively analysed these declines since soft lockdown commencing on the 13th March 2020 in a population-based study, the first of its kind. METHODS: Data was obtained as anonymised totals from MDH Clinical Performance Unit. Poisson regression was used to model the counts of weekly A&E attendances and hospital admissions. RESULTS: Outpatient attendances declined in March, stabilised in April 2020 and started to climb in May. April attendances fell to 18.8% in paediatrics and 23.4% in adults of the average of the previous January and February. A&E attendances showed the same pattern, down to 22.5% and all specialities registered a decline, paediatric > adult. Attendances dropped from circa 2600 to 588/month/100,000 population. These declines were abrupt after the second week of March. MDH admissions showed the same patterns, down from circa 1800 to 757/month/100,000 population. All declines were statistically significant. DISCUSSION: Many factors played a role in this unwilling experiment but the reduction in travel and physical human contact of all sorts (including school) contributed to a reduction in contagious diseases.

469601,Faecal calprotectin in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome: A pilot case-control study,2021,"Introduction and importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease that spread rapidly throughout the world and became a major public health concern. Approximately 5-12% of COVID-19 patients require admission to the intensive-care unit (ICU), where they often require oxygen therapy and prolonged intubation. Post-intubation laryngotracheal stenosis (PILS) is a complication that occurs in 10-22% of non-COVID-19 patients after prolonged intubation, while the rate of COVID-19 related PILS remains unknown. Additionally, there is still no consensus in the literature regarding the management modalities for PILS following COVID-19. Case presentation: Here we report two cases of tracheal stenosis after prolonged intubation due to severe COVID-19 infection. The first patient was admitted to the ICU and intubated for 21 days;3 months after discharge, he developed a 3 cm long tracheal stenosis that narrowed 70% of the lumen. The second patient was intubated for 2 months and, 4 months after discharge, developed a 2.5 cm long tracheal stenosis that narrowed 80% of the lumen. Clinical discussion: In both cases, the diagnosis was confirmed by CT scan and Rigid bronchoscopy;then, they were managed successfully with tracheal resection and reconstruction by end-to-end anastomosis. Conclusion: In conclusion, we would like to highlight the importance of suspecting PILS in recovered COVID-19 patients re-presenting with breathing difficulties following weaning from mechanical ventilation;therefore, careful follow-up in such patients is required. Moreover, we would like to point out that the management of tracheal stenosis after COVID-19 appears to be similar to that of tracheal stenosis in general.","Alturk, A.; Bara, A.; Darwish, B.",Annals of Medicine &amp; Surgery,,245

The lack of vaccines and antivirals prevents clinical strategies against the disease, creating an emerging need for the development of safe and effective treatments. Strategies for vaccine development include complete vaccines against viruses, subunits, and nucleic acids, but are still in their early stages. Studies carried out to date on possible SARS-CoV2 drug targets highlight glycoprotein S, Mpro (main protease or protease type 3C), and a member of the transmembrane serine protease II families (TMPRSS2). However, due to the pandemic state, priority is given to marketed drugs. These include chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), nitazoxanide, remdesivir, Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV / r), in addition to treatment with convalescent plasma. But, therapeutic specific effects against SARS-CoV2 have not yet been verified. Most of the information obtained about treatment is based on preliminary and limited studies. We conclude that, at this time of emergency, the search for new therapies is more urgent due to the need to save lives. Thus, we point out as interesting targets for future more specific research: glycoprotein S, Mpro, and TMPRSS2.","Campos, D.M.O.; Oliveira, C.B.S.; Andrade, J.M.A.; Oliveira, J.I.N.",Braz. J.

METHODS: Case-control study for comparing the percentage of excess weight lost (%EWL) and the percentage of total weight lost (%TWL) of patients that underwent a VG during the last year, so they were affected by lockdown in April and part of March 2020 (group 1), to the %EWL and %TWL of a control group (group 2), obtained from our previous series. RESULTS: The mean %EWL in group 1 is 47,37±18,59 and in group 2 is 51,13±17,59, being p=0,438. Meanwhile, the mean %TWL in group 1 is 21,14±8,17 and in group 2 is 24,67±8,01, with p=0,115. CONCLUSIONS: Population lockdown by COVID-19 did not get worse short-term results of vertical gastrectomy. More studies with a larger number of patients are necessary to draw firm conclusions.","Ruiz de Angulo, David; Balaguer Román, Andrés; Munitiz Ruiz, Vicente; Gil Vázquez, Pedro José; Ruiz Merino, Guadalupe; Ortiz Escandell, M Ángeles; Martínez de Haro, Luisa F; Parrilla Paricio, Pascual",Cir Esp,,245

482637,The utility of paired upper and lower COVID-19 sampling in patients with artificial airways,2020,"BACKGROUND: To combat the global COVID-19 pandemic, contact tracing apps have been discussed as digital health solutions to track infection chains and provide appropriate information. However, observational studies point to low acceptance in most countries, and few studies have yet examined theory-based predictors of app use in the general population to guide health communication efforts. OBJECTIVE: This study utilizes established health behavior change and technology acceptance models to predict adoption intentions and frequency of current app use. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey between May and July 2020 in a German convenience sample (N=349; mean age 35.62 years; n=226, 65.3% female). To inspect the incremental validity of model constructs as well as additional variables (privacy concerns, personalization), hierarchical regression models were applied, controlling for covariates. RESULTS: The theory of planned behavior and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology predicted adoption intentions (R2=56%-63%) and frequency of current app use (R2=33%-37%). A combined model only marginally increased the predictive value by about 5%, but lower privacy concerns and higher threat appraisals (ie, anticipatory anxiety) significantly predicted app use when included as additional variables. Moreover, the impact of perceived usefulness was positive for adoption intentions but negative for frequency of current app use. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several theory-based predictors of contact tracing app use. However, few constructs, such as social norms, have a consistent positive effect across models and outcomes. Further research is required to replicate these observations, and to examine the interconnectedness of these constructs and their impact throughout the pandemic. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that promulgating affirmative social norms and positive emotional effects of app use, as well as addressing health concerns, might be promising strategies to foster adoption intentions and app use in the general population.","Tomczyk, Samuel; Barth, Simon; Schmidt, Silke; Muehlan, Holger",J Med Internet Res,,245

484825,111. Outcomes Related to COVID-19 Among People Living with HIV: Cohort from a Large Academic Center,2020,"INTRODUCTION: May-Thurner Syndrome (MTS) is the extrinsic compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery against the lumbar vertebrae. While most MTS patients are asymptomatic, some develop deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from venous flow obstruction. Incidence and prevalence are unknown but estimated to occur in 2-5% of patients with lower extremity venous disease. Symptomatic MTS commonly presents in patients 20-40 years-old and rarely occurs in geriatric patients. CASE: An 82-year-old female with past medical history of hypertension, former smoker (quit 50 years prior) presented with acute left lower extremity (LLE) swelling and pain. No prior history of thrombosis, recent travel or surgery, hormone use, trauma or malignancy. Patient lived alone and was functionally independent. Upon admission, patient was afebrile and in no respiratory distress. COVID-19 testing negative. Physical exam notable for unilateral LLE 2+ pitting edema with erythema and mild tenderness. LLE ultrasound revealed extensive femoropopliteal, peroneal and posterior tibial DVT extending into the external iliac vein. CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed compression of the proximal left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery. Initially treated with heparin drip. Later underwent left iliofemoral pharmacomechanical thrombectomy with placement of bare metal stents resulting in successful restoration of blood flow. Patient was discharged on dual antiplatelet therapy and enoxaparin with plan to transition to rivaroxaban. DISCUSSION: Symptomatic MTS commonly presents in women and risk factors include hypercoagulable states, scoliosis, dehydration, cancer and radiation exposure. MTS can be treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis, venoplasty and/or stent placement. Post-thrombotic syndrome develops in 60% of iliofemoral DVTs within the first 5 years. While the decision to pursue thrombolysis and stenting is straight-forward in the typical MTS patient, this was not as obvious in our patient due to her geriatric age and uncertainty of benefit. Given her independence and few comorbidities, intervention was elected. Our case demonstrates that symptomatic MTS can present for the first time in a geriatric patient and that careful consideration is warranted in developing a treatment plan.","McAvoy, K.

The purpose of this study is to examine the role of digital infrastructure in supporting compliance with travel restrictions. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world have issued “stay-at-home” orders and curtailed a variety of economic activities. As countries have adopted aggressive policies to limit the spread of COVID-19, varying levels of national infrastructure to provide internet access have limited some nations’ ability to reduce travel requirements. As national policies struggle to address public health issues, location analytics enabled by big data provide unique insights regarding the efficacy of digital infrastructure. These insights can provide valuable tools to public health officials and regulators in understanding how health recommendations are implemented within an economy. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzes mobile phone movement data during the first half of 2020 and finds that countries that provided greater access to internet capabilities were better able to reduce work-related mobility. Findings: This study’s findings indicate that greater levels of digital infrastructure may better prepare countries to adapt to societal disruptions such as COVID-19. Practical implications: This study’s findings demonstrate that public health controls regarding movement and person-to-person interaction are less likely to be effective in nations with weaker digital infrastructure, even after accounting for variation attributable to gross domestic product (GDP) and pandemic severity. This could limit public health options in developing countries when faced with future socially disruptive events and encourage national investment in digital infrastructure. Social implications: This study’s findings highlight positive externalities associated with reducing the digital divide. Developing better digital business infrastructure globally may reduce human exposure to future pandemic risks. Originality/value: This research demonstrates the practical development implications of analysis of aggregate data widely available through mobile technology. As institutions develop techniques to ethically and effectively analyze this data, greater opportunities to support economic development may be revealed. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Taylor, J.; Taylor, R.",International Journal of Development Issues,,245

490896,Incidence of Healthcare-Associated COVID-19 During Universal Testing of Medical and Surgical Admissions in a Large US Health System,2020,"IntroductionThe aim of this study was to investigate how age and underlying medical conditions affect the risk of severe outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection and how they should be weighed while prioritising vaccinations against COVID-19. MethodsThis population-based register study includes all SARS-CoV-2 PCR-test-positive cases until 24 Feb 2021, based on the Finnish National Infectious Diseases Register. The cases were linked to other registers to identify presence of comorbidities and severe outcomes (hospitalisation, intensive care treatment, death). The odds of severe outcomes were compared in those with and without the pre-specified comorbidities using logistic regression. Furthermore, population-based rates were compared between those with a given comorbidity and those without any of the specified comorbidities using negative binomial regression. ResultsAge and various comorbidities were found to be predictors of severe COVID-19. Compared to 60-69-year-olds, the odds ratio (OR) of death was 7.1 for 70-79-year-olds, 26.7 for 80-89-year-olds, and 55.8 for [≥]90-year-olds. Among the 20-69-year-olds, chronic renal disease (OR 9.4), malignant neoplasms (5.8), hematologic malignancy (5.6), chronic pulmonary disease (5.4), and cerebral palsy or other paralytic syndromes (4.6) were strongly associated with COVID-19 mortality; severe disorders of the immune system (8.0), organ or stem cell transplant (7.2), chronic renal disease (6.7), and diseases of myoneural junction and muscle (5.5) were strongly associated with COVID-19 hospitalisation. Type 2 diabetes and asthma, two very common comorbidities, were associated with all three outcomes, with ORs from 2.1 to 4.3. The population-based rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased with age. Taking the 60-69-year-olds as reference, the rate ratio was highest (3.0) for 20-29-year-olds but <1 for 70-79-year-olds and 80-89-year-olds. ConclusionComorbidities predispose for severe COVID-19 among younger ages. In vaccine prioritisation both the risk of infection and the risk of severe outcomes, if infected, should be combined.","Salo, Heini; Lehtonen, Toni; Auranen, Kari; Baum, Ulrike; Leino, Tuija",,,245

494862,Unique pattern of COVID-19 infection in the State of Hawai'i,2020,"Biomarkers of low-grade inflammation have been associated with susceptibility to a severe infectious disease course, even when measured prior to disease onset. We investigated whether metabolic biomarkers measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy could be associated with susceptibility to severe pneumonia (2507 hospitalised or fatal cases) and severe COVID-19 (652 hospitalised cases) in 105,146 generally healthy individuals from UK Biobank, with blood samples collected 2007-2010. The overall signature of metabolic biomarker associations was similar for the risk of severe pneumonia and severe COVID-19. A multi-biomarker score, comprised of 25 proteins, fatty acids, amino acids and lipids, was associated equally strongly with enhanced susceptibility to severe COVID-19 (odds ratio 2.9 [95%CI 2.1-3.8] for highest vs lowest quintile) and severe pneumonia events occurring 7-11 years after blood sampling (2.6 [1.7-3.9]). However, the risk for severe pneumonia occurring during the first 2 years after blood sampling for people with elevated levels of the multi-biomarker score was over four times higher than for long-term risk (8.0 [4.1-15.6]). If these hypothesis generating findings on increased susceptibility to severe pneumonia during the first few years after blood sampling extend to severe COVID-19, metabolic biomarker profiling could potentially complement existing tools for identifying individuals at high risk. These results provide novel molecular understanding on how metabolic biomarkers reflect the susceptibility to severe COVID-19 and other infections in the general population.","Julkunen, Heli; Cichonska, Anna; Slagboom, P Eline; Würtz, Peter",eLife (Cambridge),,245

The severity of the illness can also extend from mild disease to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 infection can also affect the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreatic functions, leading to gastrointestinal symptoms. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 can cause central and peripheral neurological manifestations, affect the cardiovascular system and promote renal dysfunction. Epidemiological data have indicated that cancer patients are at a higher risk of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Considering the multitude of clinical symptoms of COVID-19, the objective of the present review was to summarize their pathophysiology in previously healthy patients, as well as in those with comorbidities. The present review summarizes the current, though admittedly fluid knowledge on the pathophysiology and symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Although unclear issues still remain, the present study contributes to a more complete understanding of the disease, and may drive the direction of new research. The recognition of the severity of the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 is crucial for the specific therapeutic management of affected patients.","Tsatsakis, Aristides; Calina, Daniela; Falzone, Luca; Petrakis, Dimitrios; Mitrut, Radu; Siokas, Vasileios; Pennisi, Manuela; Lanza, Giuseppe; Libra, Massimo; Doukas, Sotirios G; Doukas, Panagiotis G; Kavali, Leena; Bukhari, Amar; Gadiparthi, Chiranjeevi; Vageli, Dimitra P; Kofteridis, Diamantis P; Spandidos, Demetrios A; Paoliello, Monica M B; Aschner, Michael; Docea, Anca Oana",Food Chem Toxicol,,245
496289,Tocilizumab use in COVID-19: Act(EMRA) to inhibit intubation and decompensation,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) that first occurred in Wuhan, China, is currently spreading throughout China. The majority of infected patients either traveled to Wuhan or came into contact with an infected person from Wuhan. Investigating members of the public with a travel history to Wuhan became the primary focus of the Chinese government's epidemic prevention and control measures, but several instances of withheld histories were uncovered as localized clusters of infections broke out. This study investigated the public's willingness and beliefs associated with reporting travel history to high-risk epidemic regions, to provide effective suggestions and measures for encouraging travel reporting. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted online between February 12 and 19, 2020. Descriptive analysis, chi-squared test, and Fisher's exact test were used to identify socio-demographic factors and beliefs associated with reporting, as well as their impact on the willingness to report on travel history to high-risk epidemic regions. RESULTS: Of the 1344 respondents, 91 (6.77%) expressed an inclination to deliberately withhold travel history. Those who understood the benefits of reporting and the legal consequences for deliberately withholding information, showed greater willingness to report their history (P < 0.05); conversely, those who believed reporting would stigmatize them and feared being quarantined after reporting showed less willingness to report (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: As any incident of withheld history can have unpredictable outcomes, the proportion of people who deliberately withhold information deserves attention. Appropriate public risk communication and public advocacy strategies should be implemented to strengthen the understanding that reporting on travel history facilitates infection screening and prompt treatment, and to decrease the fear of potentially becoming quarantined after reporting. Additionally, social support and policies should be established, and measures should be taken to alleviate stigmatization and discrimination against potential patients and reporters of travel history. Reinforcing the legal accountability of withholding travel history and strengthening systematic community monitoring are the measures that China is currently taking to encourage reporting on travel history to high-risk epidemic regions. These non-pharmaceutical interventions are relevant for countries that are currently facing the spread of the epidemic and those at risk of its potential spread.","Wei, Lifeng; Sha, Zhuowa; Wang, Ying; Zhang, Gangyu; Jia, Haonan; Zhou, Shuang; Li, Yuanheng; Wang, Yameng; Liu, Chao; Jiao, Mingli; Sun, Shufan; Wu, Qunhong",BMC Public Health,,245

496928,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in an Adult,2021,"This study aimed at an experimental design of response surface methodology (RSM) in the optimization of the dominant volatile fraction of Greek thyme honey using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For this purpose, a multiple response optimization was employed using desirability functions, which demand a search for optimal conditions for a set of responses simultaneously. A test set of eighty thyme honey samples were analyzed under the optimum conditions for validation of the proposed model. The optimized combination of isolation conditions was the temperature (60 °C), equilibration time (15 min), extraction time (30 min), magnetic stirrer speed (700 rpm), sample volume (6 mL), water: honey ratio (1:3 v/w) with total desirability over 0.50. It was found that the magnetic stirrer speed, which has not been evaluated before, had a positive effect, especially in combination with other factors. The above-developed methodology proved to be effective in the optimization of isolation of specific volatile compounds from a difficult matrix, like honey.

497857,"Prevalence of COVID-19 in children, adolescents and adults in remote education situations in the city of Fortaleza, Brazil",2021,"A growing number of interventions incorporate digital and social technologies (eg, social media, mobile phone apps, and wearable devices) into their design for behavior change. However, because of a number of factors, including changing trends in the use of technology over time, results on the efficacy of these interventions have been mixed. An updated framework is needed to help researchers better plan behavioral technology interventions by anticipating the needed resources and potential changes in trends that may affect interventions over time. Focusing on the domain of health interventions as a use case, we present the Adaptive Behavioral Components (ABC) model for technology-based behavioral interventions. ABC is composed of five components: basic behavior change; intervention, or problem-focused characteristics; population, social, and behavioral characteristics; individual-level and personality characteristics; and technology characteristics. ABC was designed with the goals of (1) guiding high-level development for digital technology-based interventions; (2) helping interventionists consider, plan for, and adapt to potential barriers that may arise during longitudinal interventions; and (3) providing a framework to potentially help increase the consistency of findings among digital technology intervention studies. We describe the planning of an HIV prevention intervention as a case study for how to implement ABC into intervention design. Using the ABC model to plan future interventions might help to improve the design of and adherence to longitudinal behavior change intervention protocols; allow these interventions to adapt, anticipate, and prepare for changes that may arise over time; and help to potentially improve intervention behavior change outcomes. Additional research is needed on the influence of each of ABC's components to help improve intervention design and implementation.","Young, Sean D",J Med Internet Res,,245
498745,The largest epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Vietnam,2020,"Similar to other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 must (1) enter a target/host cell, (2) reprogram it to ensure its replication, (3) exit the host cell, and (4) repeat this cycle for exponential growth. During the exit step, the virus hijacks the sophisticated machineries that host cells employ to correctly fold, assemble, and transport proteins along the exocytic pathway. Therefore, secretory pathway-mediated assemblage and excretion of infective particles represent appealing targets to reduce the efficacy of virus biogenesis, if not to block it completely. Here, we analyze and discuss the contribution of the molecular machines operating in the early secretory pathway in the biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and their relevance for potential antiviral targeting. The fact that these molecular machines are conserved throughout evolution, together with the redundancy and tissue specificity of their components, provides opportunities in the search for unique proteins essential for SARS-CoV-2 biology that could also be targeted with therapeutic objectives. Finally, we provide an overview of recent evidence implicating proteins of the early secretory pathway as potential antiviral targets with effective therapeutic applications.","Sicari, Daria; Chatziioannou, Aristotelis; Koutsandreas, Theodoros; Sitia, Roberto; Chevet, Eric",J. cell. biol,,245
499709,A comparative study of immunoglobulin only and immunoglobulin with methylprednisolone for treating children with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome,2021,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, so ACE2-expressing cells can act as target cells and are susceptible to infection. ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the oral cavity, so this may be a potential high-risk route for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the virus can be detected in saliva, even before COVID-19 symptoms appear, with the consequent high risk of virus transmission in asymptomatic/presymptomatic patients. Reducing oral viral load could lead to a lower risk of transmission via salivary droplets or aerosols and therefore contribute to the control of the pandemic. Our aim was to evaluate the available evidence testing the in-vitro and in-vivo effects of oral antiseptics to inactivate or eradicate coronaviruses. The criteria used were those described in the PRISMA declaration for performing systematic reviews. An electronic search was conducted in Medline (via PubMed) and in Web of Sciences, using the MeSH terms: 'mouthwash' OR 'oral rinse' OR 'mouth rinse' OR 'povidone iodine' OR 'hydrogen peroxide' OR 'cetylpyridinium chloride' AND 'COVID-19' OR 'SARS-CoV-2' OR 'coronavirus' OR 'SARS' OR 'MERS'. The initial search strategy identified 619 articles on two electronic databases. Seventeen articles were included assessing the virucidal efficacy of oral antiseptics against coronaviruses. In conclusion, there is sufficient in-vitro evidence to support the use of antiseptics to potentially reduce the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. However, in-vivo evidence for most oral antiseptics is limited. Randomized clinical trials with a control group are needed to demonstrate its clinical efficacy.","Mateos-Moreno, M V; Mira, A; Ausina-Márquez, V; Ferrer, M D",J Hosp Infect,,245

501766,Asthma prolongs intubation in COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare facilities in Ethiopia are responsible for collecting samples for testing and treating COVID-19 patients, providing COVID-19 information to staff, establishment of response teams, and provision of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). Working at the frontlines against the pandemic, health care providers' level of knowledge about COVID-19, attitude towards their work, and confidence in the preparedness of their facilities are essential factors in mounting a successful response. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the knowledge level of HCP in Ethiopia on this novel coronavirus, and their perspectives on whether their workplaces have sufficient preparedness to handle this disease. METHODS: A self-administered online survey was conducted. RESULTS: The knowledge related to COVID-19 among HCPs was high, with an overall average of 91.5%. The majority of our respondents were supportive to the government's measures to minimize disease transmission, but most of them were also frustrated by how COVID affected their day to day lives. The majority of them were worried about contracting COVID at work and transmitting the infection to their families. Most respondents did not feel safe going to work (P<0.001). Apart from providing adequate information on COVID-19, most workplaces did not have sufficient PPE (P<000.1) and medical supplies (P<0.001). Close to 50% of respondents agreed and disagreed that their workplaces had clear protocols for handling COVID-19 (P = 0.144). Those who handled known COVID patients were more likely to agree their workplaces had clear protocols (OR = 2.69, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Improving supplies of PPEs and establishing a clear communicating protocol in handling COVID patients are highly recommended.","Gebreselassie, Agazi Fitsum; Bekele, Abebe; Tatere, Heaven Yeshaneh; Wong, Rex",PLoS One,,245
502262,Significantly Lower Case-fatality Ratio of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong-A Territory-Wide Cohort Study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Therapies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its life-threatening respiratory infection coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been evaluated, including COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP). Multiple large reports of CCP treatment in adults exist. Pediatric data on CCP safety and efficacy are limited. METHODS: Single-center prospective, open-label trial looking at safety, antibody kinetics and outcomes of CCP (10 mL/kg, max 1 unit) treatment for COVID-19 in hospitalized pediatric patients with moderate to severe disease or at high risk for serious illness. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled. No infusion-related adverse events occurred. No hematological or metabolic adverse events were noted during hospitalization or at 3-weeks. Ten patients had clinical improvement by day 7 (WHO eight-category ordinal severity scale for COVID-19). Following CCP, anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid IgG increased significantly at 24 hours and high levels were sustained at 7- and 21-days. Transient IgM response was noted. Twelve patients (92.3%) were discharged home, 9 (75%) by day 7 post-CCP. One remained on invasive ventilatory support 42 days after CCP and was eventually discharged to an intermediate care facility. The single patient death was retrospectively confirmed to have had brain death before CCP. CONCLUSION: CCP was well tolerated in pediatric patients, resulted in rapid antibody increase, and did not appear to interfere with immune responses measured at 21 days. More pediatric data are necessary to establish the efficacy of CCP, but our data suggest benefit in moderate to severe COVID-19 when used early. Other immunological or antiviral interventions may be added as supported by emerging data.","Arrieta, Antonio; Galvis, Alvaro E; Morphew, Tricia; Ehwerhemuepha, Louis; Osborne, Stephanie; Enriquez, Claudia; Imfeld, Karen; Hoang, Janet; Nieves, Delma; Ashouri, Negar; Singh, Jasjit; Nugent, Diane",Pediatr. infect. dis. j,,245

Some countries have considered the use of immunity certification as a strategy to relax these measures for people who have recovered from the infection by issuing these individuals a document, commonly called an immunity passport. This document certifies them as having protective immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. The World Health Organization has advised against the implementation of immunity certification at present because of uncertainty about whether long-term immunity truly exists for those who have recovered from COVID-19 and concerns over the reliability of the proposed serological test method for determining immunity. Immunity certification can only be considered if scientific thresholds for assuring immunity are met, whether based on antibodies or other criteria. However, even if immunity certification became well supported by science, it has many ethical issues in terms of different restrictions on individual liberties and its implementation process. We examine the main considerations for the ethical acceptability of immunity certification to exempt individuals from restrictive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. As well as needing to meet robust scientific criteria, the ethical acceptability of immunity certification depends on its uses and policy objectives and the measures in place to reduce potential harms, and prevent disproportionate burdens on non-certified individuals and violation of individual liberties and rights.","Voo, Teck Chuan; Reis, Andreas A; Thomé, Beatriz; Ho, Calvin Wl; Tam, Clarence C; Kelly-Cirino, Cassandra; Emanuel, Ezekiel; Beca, Juan P; Littler, Katherine; Smith, Maxwell J; Parker, Michael; Kass, Nancy; Gobat, Nina; Lei, Ruipeng; Upshur, Ross; Hurst, Samia; Munsaka, Sody",Bull World Health Organ,,245

Many of the alternatives available to hospitals have not been certified, leaving uncertainty about their ability to properly protect healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 transmission. OBJECTIVE: For situations where regulatory methods are not accessible, we present experimental methods to evaluate mask filtration and breathability quickly via cost-effective approaches (e.g., ~$2000 USD) that could be replicated in communities of need without extensive infrastructure. We demonstrate the need for screening by evaluating an existing diverse inventory of masks/respirators from a local hospital. METHODS: Two experimental approaches are presented to examine both aerosol filtration and flow impedance (i.e., breathability). For one of the approaches (""quick assessment""), screening for appropriate filtration could be performed under 10 min per mask, on average. Mask fit tests were conducted in tandem but are not the focus of this study. RESULTS: Tests conducted of 47 nonregulation masks reveal variable performance. A number of commercially available masks in hospital inventories perform similarly to N95 masks for aerosol filtration of 0.2 µm and above, but there is a range of masks with relatively lower filtration efficiencies (e.g., <90%) and a subset with poorer filtration (e.g., <70%). All masks functioned acceptably for breathability, and impedance was not correlated with filtration efficiency. SIGNIFICANCE: With simplified tests, organizations with mask/respirator shortages and uncertain inventories can make informed decisions about use and procurement.","Schilling, Katherine; Gentner, Drew R; Wilen, Lawrence; Medina, Antonio; Buehler, Colby; Perez-Lorenzo, Luis J; Pollitt, Krystal J Godri; Bergemann, Reza; Bernardo, Nick; Peccia, Jordan; Wilczynski, Vincent; Lattanza, Lisa",J. expo. sci. environ. epidemiol,,245

Case reports of intracerebral hemorrhages in ventilated COVID-19 patients warrant precaution. It is unclear, however, if COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with or without veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy (VV-ECMO) have more intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) compared to other ARDS patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational single-center study enrolling all patients with ARDS from 01/2018 to 05/2020. PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 patients with ARDS were allocated to the COVID-19 group. Propensity score matching was performed for age, VV-ECMO, and bleeding risk. RESULTS: A total of 163 patients with moderate or severe ARDS were identified, 47 (28.8%) in the COVID-19 group, and 116 (71.2%) in the non-COVID-19 group. In 63/163 cases (38.7%), VV-ECMO therapy was required. The ICU survival was 52.8%. COVID-19 patients were older, more often male, and exhibited a lower SOFA score, but the groups showed similar rates of VV-ECMO therapy. Treatments with antiplatelet agents (p = 0.043) and therapeutic anticoagulation (p = 0.028) were significantly more frequent in the COVID-19 patients. ICH was detected in 22 patients (13.5%) with no statistical difference between the groups (11.2 vs. 19.1% without and with SARS-CoV-2, respectively, p = 0.21). Propensity score matching confirmed similar rates of ICH in both groups (12.8 vs. 19.1% without and with SARS-CoV-2, respectively, p = 0.57), thus leveling out possible confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Intracerebral hemorrhage was detected in every tenth patient with ARDS. Despite statistically higher rates of antiplatelet therapy and therapeutic anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients, we found a similar rate of ICH in patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 compared to other causes of ARDS.","Lang, Corinna N; Dettinger, Johanna S; Berchtold-Herz, Michael; Utzolino, Stefan; Bemtgen, Xavier; Zotzmann, Viviane; Schmid, Bonaventura; Biever, Paul M; Bode, Christoph; Müller-Peltzer, Katharina; Duerschmied, Daniel; Wengenmayer, Tobias; Niesen, Wolf-Dirk; Staudacher, Dawid L",Neurocritical care,,245

METHODS: We measured IgG, IgM, and IgA to the receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in mildly symptomatic (n = 108) and asymptomatic (n = 63) on days 1, 7, 14, and 30 following RT-PCR confirmation in Bangladesh and when compared with pre-pandemic samples, including healthy controls (n = 73) and individuals infected with other viruses (n = 79). RESULTS: Mildly symptomatic individuals developed IgM and IgA responses by day 14 in 72% and 83% of individuals, respectively, while 95% of individuals developed IgG response, and rose to 100% by day 30. In contrast, individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 but who remained asymptomatic developed antibody responses significantly less frequently, with only 20% positive for IgA and 22% positive for IgM by day 14, and 45% positive for IgG by day 30 after infection. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm immune responses are generated following COVID-19 who develop mildly symptomatic illness.

The daily positivity rate increased over the study period, from 5.4% during the first week to a peak of 47.4%. (P-trend <0.001). Patients with fever (aOR: 1.7; 95% CI 1.3, 2.3) or cough (aOR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1, 1.9) and those with known contact with someone with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (aOR: 1.6; 95% CI 1.0, 2.4.) were more likely have a positive test, but these features were not-highly discriminating. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of mildly symptomatic or well children and adolescents referred to a community drive-through/walk-up SARS-CoV-2 testing site because of risk of exposure or clinical illness, one in four patients had a positive test. Children and young adults represent a considerable burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assessment of their role in transmission is essential to implementing appropriate control measures.","Simpson, Joelle N; Goyal, Monika K; Cohen, Joanna S; Badolato, Gia M; McGuire, Mark; Ralph, Abigail; Boyle, Meleah D; Hamburger, Ellen K; Gorman, Kathleen C; Cora-Bramble, Denice; Delaney, Meghan",J. pediatr.

In a retrospective study of 41 patients with COVID-19, most patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection developed mild symptoms, whereas some patients later developed aggravated disease symptoms, and eventually passed away because of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), as a consequence of a severe cytokine storm. Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected pneumonia were first published January 30th, 2020; these guidelines recommended for the first time that cytokine monitoring should be applied in severely ill patients to reduce pneumonia related mortality. The cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 illness is also an important component of mortality in other viral diseases, including SARS, MERS and influenza. In view of the severe morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia, we review the current understanding of treatment of human coronavirus infections from the perspective of a dysregulated cytokine and immune response.","Sun, Xinjuan; Wang, Tianyuan; Cai, Dayong; Hu, Zhiwei; Chen, Jin039; an,; Liao, Hui; Zhi, Liming; Wei, Hongxia; Zhang, Zhihong; Qiu, Yuying; Wang, Jing; Wang, Aiping",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,,245

The study was designed to detect circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor single cell genes by applying microfluidic chip technology. It was used to explore the clinical application value in breast cancer. METHODS: We have developed a size-based CTCs sorting microfluidic chip, which contains a hexagonal array and a micro-pipe channel array to isolate and confirm both single CTCs and CTCs clusters. The sorting performance of the as-fabricated chip was tested by analyzing the clinical samples collected from 129 breast cancer patients and 50 healthy persons. RESULTS: In this study, the chip can detect different immunophenotypes of CTCs in breast cancer patients. It was found that the new microfluidic device had high sensitivity (73.6%) and specificity (82.0%) in detecting CTCs. By detecting the blood samples of 129 breast cancer patients and 50 healthy blood donors, it was found that the number of CTCs was not associated with clinical factors such as age, gender, pathological type, and tumor size of breast cancer patients (P > 0.05), but was associated with TNM staging of breast cancer, with or without metastasis (P < 0.005). There was a statistically significant difference in the number of CTCs between luminal A (ER+/PR+/HER2-) and HER-2+ (ER-/PR-/HER2+) (P < 0.05). The best cut-off level distinguished by CTC between the breast cancer patients and the healthy persons was 3.5 cells/mL, with 0.845 for AUC-ROC, 0.790-0.901 for 95% CI, 73.6% for sensitivity, and 82% for specificity (Pâ¯=â¯0.000). The combination of CTC, CEA, CA125 and CA153 can provide more effective breast cancer screening. CONCLUSIONS: The CTCs analysis method presented here doesn't rely on the specific antibody, such as anti-EpCAM, which would avoid the missed inspection caused by antibody-relied methods and offer more comprehensive biological information for clinical breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.","Zhang, Xiaofen; Lu, Xu; Gao, Wanlei; Wang, Yanmin; Jia, Chunping; Cong, Hui",Transl Oncol,,245

Six of these patients were intubated for mechanical ventilation, 2 of whom had to be extubated. We prepared a clear vinyl sheet in the shape of a tent to place over the patient, and 2 staff members, both well experienced in airway management, stood outside the tent on either side of the patient. Before extubation, we confirmed that the patient's consciousness level was good and the patient had no distress by adjusting the dose of sedative drugs. After extubation, a surgical mask was placed on the patient's face.

590350,Disparities in Susceptibility to Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children,2021,"Background and objectives: In addition to conventional healthcare, Ebola survivors are known to seek traditional and complementary healthcare (T&CM) options to meet their healthcare needs. However, little is known about the general beliefs of Ebola survivors regarding T&CM and the impact of these beliefs in influencing their decisions around T&CM use. This study examines Ebola survivors’ attitudes towards T&CM use in Sierra Leone. Materials and Methods: We conducted a nationwide quantitative cross-sectional study of 358 Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone between January and August 2018. We used descriptive analysis, chi-square tests and backward stepwise binary logistic regression for data analysis. Results: Close to half of the survivors (n = 163, 45.5%) had used T&CM since their discharge from an Ebola treatment centre. Survivors who viewed T&CM as boosting their immune system/resistance were 3.89 times (95%CI: 1.57–9.63, p = 0.003) more likely to use T&CM than those who did not view T&CM as boosting their immune system/resistance. Additionally, survivors who viewed T&CM as having fewer side effects than conventional medicine were more likely to use T&CM [OR = 5.03 (95%CI: 1.92–13.19, p = 0.001)]. Ebola survivors were more influenced to use T&CM based on their personal experience of the effectiveness of T&CM than by clinical evidence [OR = 13.72 (95%CI: 6.10–30.84, P < 0.001)]. Ebola survivors who perceived T&CM as providing them with more control than conventional medicine over their health/body were more likely to use T&CM [OR = 4.15 (95%CI: 1.74–9.89, p = 0.001)] as opposed to those who did not perceive T&CM in this way. Conclusions: Considering the widespread use of T&CM, an understanding of Ebola survivors’ attitudes/beliefs towards T&CM is useful to healthcare providers and policymakers with regard to public education and practitioner–survivors communication, T&CM regulation and research in Sierra Leone. Ebola survivors appear to turn to T&CM not only for treatment, but also to fill gaps in conventional health care services.","James, Peter Bai; Wardle, Jon; Steel, Amie; Adams, Jon",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31323758/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina55070387,245

Yet, MMT’s use of restrictive take-home dose policies that force most patients to attend their clinic on a daily, or near-daily, basis may be unpopular with many patients and lead to low rates of treatment uptake and retention. In response, this article examines how clinics’ take-home dosing policies have affected patients’ experiences of treatment and lives in general. METHODS: This article is based on semi-structured, qualitative interviews with a variety of stakeholders in MMT. Interviews explored: reasons for engaging with, or not engaging with MMT; how MMT is conceptualized by patients and treatment providers (e.g., as harm reduction or route to abstinence and/or recovery); experiences with MMT; perception of barriers to MMT (e.g., organizational/regulatory, social) and how MMT might be improved to support peoples’ substance use treatment needs and goals. RESULTS: Nearly all of the patients with past or present MMT use were highly critical of the limited access to take-home doses and consequent need for daily or near daily clinic attendance. Participants described how the use of restrictive take-home dose policies negatively impacted their ability to meet day-to-day responsibilities and also cited the need for daily attendance as a reason for quitting or avoiding OAT. Responses also demonstrate how such policies contribute to an environment of cruelty and stigma within many clinics that exposes this already-stigmatized population to additional trauma. CONCLUSIONS: Take-home dose policies in MMT are not working for a substantial number of patients and are reasonably seen by participants as degrading and dehumanizing. Revision of MMT regulations and policies regarding take home doses are essential to improve patient satisfaction and the quality and effectiveness of MMT as a key evidence-based treatment and harm reduction strategy.","Frank, David; Mateu-Gelabert, Pedro; Perlman, David C.; Walters, Suzan M.; Curran, Laura; Guarino, Honoria",Harm Reduct J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34391436/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-021-00535-y,245

However, little is known about what Americans think of getting immunized with a COVID-19 vaccine. Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive and systematic national assessment of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in a community-based sample of the American adult population. A multi‐item valid and reliable questionnaire was deployed online via mTurk and social media sites to recruit U.S. adults from the general population. A total of 1878 individuals participated in the study where the majority were: females (52%), Whites (74%), non-Hispanic (81%), married (56%), employed full time (68%), and with a bachelor’s degree or higher (77%). The likelihood of getting a COVID-19 immunization in the study population was: very likely (52%), somewhat likely (27%), not likely (15%), definitely not (7%), with individuals who had lower education, income, or perceived threat of getting infected being more likely to report that they were not likely/definitely not going to get COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., vaccine hesitancy). In unadjusted group comparisons, compared to their counterparts, vaccine hesitancy was higher among African-Americans (34%), Hispanics (29%), those who had children at home (25%), rural dwellers (29%), people in the northeastern U.S. (25%), and those who identified as Republicans (29%). In multiple regression analyses, vaccine hesitancy was predicted significantly by sex, education, employment, income, having children at home, political affiliation, and the perceived threat of getting infected with COVID-19 in the next 1 year. Given the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, evidence-based communication, mass media strategies, and policy measures will have to be implemented across the U.S. to convert vaccines into vaccinations and mass immunization with special attention to the groups identified in this study.","Khubchandani, Jagdish; Sharma, Sushil; Price, James H.; Wiblishauser, Michael J.; Sharma, Manoj; Webb, Fern J.",J Community Health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-020-00958-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33389421/,245

So, a robust engine with capability to administer useful information is desired to achieve the success. The forecasting effectiveness of stock market is improved in this paper by integrating a modified crow search algorithm (CSA) and extreme learning machine (ELM). The effectiveness of proposed modified CSA entitled as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based Group oriented CSA (PGCSA) to outperform other existing algorithms is observed by solving 12 benchmark problems. PGCSA algorithm is used to achieve relevant weights and biases of ELM to improve the effectiveness of conventional ELM. The impact of hybrid PGCSA ELM model to predict next day closing price of seven different stock indices is observed by using performance measures, technical indicators and hypothesis test (paired t-test). The seven stock indices are considered by incorporating data during COVID-19 outbreak. This model is tested by comparing with existing techniques proposed in published works.

In this article, six recent advances in exposure characterization by sampling and analysis are reviewed as tools in the occupational exposure assessment of aerosols. Three advances discussed in detail are (1) recognition and inclusion of sampler wall deposits; (2) development of a new sampling and analytical procedure for respirable crystalline silica that allows non-destructive field analysis at the end of the sampling period; and (3) development of a new sampler to collect the portion of sub-300 nm aerodynamic diameter particles that would deposit in human airways. Three additional developments are described briefly: (4) a size-selective aerosol sampler that allows the collection of multiple physiologically-relevant size fractions; (5) a miniaturized pump and versatile sampling head to meet multiple size-selective sampling criteria; and (6) a novel method of sampling bioaerosols including viruses while maintaining viability. These recent developments are placed in the context of the historical evolution in sampling and analytical developments from 1900 to the present day. While these are not the only advances in exposure characterization, or exposure assessment techniques, they provide an illustration of how technological advances are adding more tools to our toolkit. The review concludes with a number of recommended areas for future research, including expansion of real-time and end-of-shift on-site measurement, development of samplers that operate at higher flow-rates to ensure measurement at lowered limit values, and development of procedures that accurately distinguish aerosol and vapor phases of semi-volatile substances.","Harper, Martin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962023/,245

DESIGN: The group of subjects consisted of 1800 hospital practitioners and 73 quarantined patients undergoing hemodialysis. The Impact of Events Scale–Revised (IES-R) was administered to the practitioners twice, once during the hospital shutdown and again one month after the shutdown. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were administered to patients undergoing hemodialysis. RESULTS: During the initial stages of the MERS outbreak, healthcare workers who performed MERS-related tasks scored significantly higher on the total IES-R and its subscales. In the second assessment of the high-risk group, the sleep and numbness subscale scores from the IES-R differed depending on the implementation of home quarantine, and the intrusion subscale scores differed depending on the performance of MERS-related tasks. CONCLUSION: Medical staff that performed MERS-related tasks showed the highest risk for post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms even after time had elapsed.

Dangers of the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination in COVID-19 patients,2021-02-05,"OBJECTIVES: Outbreaks and containment measures implemented to control them can increase stress in affected populations. The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on perceived stress levels in the Jordanian population is unknown. The aim of the study was to determine the perceived stress level and factors associated with it in the Jordanian population during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Required data, such as those from the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and possible predictors of perceived stress, were collected through a Web-based survey. Statistical analysis was conducted through SPSS. RESULTS: The mean (SD) of perceived stress score was 19.8 (6.7). Regression analysis revealed that stress was increased in females, young adults, usually being stressed more than others by a health problem, increased perceived severity of the disease, increased overall worry score, and student’s worry regarding their studies/graduation. Perceived stress was decreased if participants’ self-rated health status score increased. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of increasing public health preparedness, the results of this study can be used in designing interventions to alleviate stress in susceptible segments of the Jordanian community.","Abdel Jalil, Mariam H.; Alsous, Mervat M.; Hammad, Eman A.; Mousa, Rimal; Saleh, Mais M.; Abu Hammour, Khawla",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32900410/,245

We aimed to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of calcium fortified foods on calcium intake and related health, or economic outcomes. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis involving participants of any age or gender, drawn from the general population. We searched PubMed, Agricola, EMBASE, CINAHL, Global Health, EconLit, the FAO website and Google until June 2019, without language restrictions. Pair of reviewers independently selected, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies using Covidence software. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. We performed meta-analyses using RevMan 5.4 and subgroup analyses by study design, age group, and fortification levels. We included 20 studies of which 15 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), three were non-randomised studies and two were economic evaluations. Most RCTs had high risk of bias on randomization or blinding. Most represented groups were women and children from 1 to 72 months, most common intervention vehicles were milk and bakery products with a fortification levels between 96 and 1200 mg per 100 g of food. Calcium intake increased in the intervention groups between 460 mg (children) and 1200 mg (postmenopausal women). Most marked effects were seen in children. Compared to controls, height increased 0.83 cm (95% CI 0.00; 1.65), plasma parathyroid hormone decreased -1.51 pmol/L, (-2.37; -0.65), urine:calcium creatinine ratio decreased -0.05, (-0.07; -0.03), femoral neck and hip bone mineral density increased 0.02 g/cm2 (0.01; 0.04) and 0.03 g/cm2 (0.00; 0.06), respectively. The largest cost savings (43%) reported from calcium fortification programs came from prevented hip fractures in older women from Germany. Our study highlights that calcium fortification leads to a higher calcium intake, small benefits in children's height and bone health and also important evidence gaps for other outcomes and populations that could be solved with high quality experimental or quasi-experimental studies in relevant groups, especially as some evidence of calcium supplementation show controversial results on the bone health benefit on older adults.","Cormick, Gabriela; Betran, Ana Pilar; Romero, Iris Beatriz; Cormick, Maria Sol; Belizán, José M; Bardach, Ariel; Ciapponi, Agustín",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33499250/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020316,245

Understanding 2-1-1 PrEP facilitators and barriers, especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, may guide researchers and healthcare providers in future studies and clinical preparedness. We conducted a national cross-sectional study of MSM in the US who had taken 2-1-1 PrEP to examine facilitators and barriers of this on-demand PrEP dosing option. With the shelter-in-place orders in March 2020, this study was adapted to include questions on how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affected participants’ PrEP use. A total of 140 individuals participated in the survey, 106 of which completed questions pertaining to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The most common reasons for switching from once-daily to 2-1-1 PrEP included having sex less frequently (63.6%) and wanting to take fewer pills (46.4%). Participants reported high medication adherence based on each component of 2-1-1 PrEP dosing (>84%). The most common barriers with 2-1-1 PrEP dosing included unplanned sexual encounters resulting in missing the double-dose pre-sex (43.6%) and trouble remembering doses post-sex (29.3%). Facilitators of the 2-1-1 PrEP dosing strategy included reductions in sexual encounters (63.6%), preference to take fewer pills (46.4%), need to reduce cost (22.1%), and desire to reduce side effects (19.3%). Challenges to receiving PrEP services during the pandemic included obtaining laboratory testing (25.5%) and PrEP refills (either receipt of a refill authorization from a healthcare provider or processing of a refill from the pharmacy) (18.9%). 2-1-1 PrEP is an effective HIV prevention method; therefore, understanding facilitators and barriers of this dosing strategy can result in continuous provision of HIV prevention efforts, particularly during a pandemic.","Camp, Christina; Saberi, Parya",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34014998/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251917,245

Although a subject of controversy and a considerable scientific literature, we think that a solid understanding of ME/CFS pathogenesis is emerging. In this study, we compiled recent findings and placed them in the context of the clinical picture and natural history of the disease. A pattern emerged, giving rise to an explanatory model. ME/CFS often starts after or during an infection. A logical explanation is that the infection initiates an autoreactive process, which affects several functions, including brain and energy metabolism. According to our model for ME/CFS pathogenesis, patients with a genetic predisposition and dysbiosis experience a gradual development of B cell clones prone to autoreactivity. Under normal circumstances these B cell offsprings would have led to tolerance. Subsequent exogenous microbial exposition (triggering) can lead to comorbidities such as fibromyalgia, thyroid disorder, and orthostatic hypotension. A decisive infectious trigger may then lead to immunization against autoantigens involved in aerobic energy production and/or hormone receptors and ion channel proteins, producing postexertional malaise and ME/CFS, affecting both muscle and brain. In principle, cloning and sequencing of immunoglobulin variable domains could reveal the evolution of pathogenic clones. Although evidence consistent with the model accumulated in recent years, there are several missing links in it. Hopefully, the hypothesis generates testable propositions that can augment the understanding of the pathogenesis of ME/CFS.","Blomberg, Jonas; Gottfries, Carl-Gerhard; Elfaitouri, Amal; Rizwan, Muhammad; Rosén, Anders",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29497420/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.00229,245

L’admission au REB peut altérer la qualité des soins et avoir un impact sur l’anxiété et l’insatisfaction des patients et des professionnels de la santé (PS). Matériels et méthodes Le service des maladies infectieuses abrite une unité REB de 7 chambres, avec sas et système de ventilation à pression d’air négative. Nous avons mené une étude qualitative basée sur des entretiens individuels semi-dirigés pour évaluer les perceptions des patients et des PS. L’analyse a été faite en identifiant les thèmes et sous-thèmes. Résultats Quatorze patients séjournant au moins trois jours et 16 PS travaillant régulièrement dans l’unité REB ont été interrogés. Respectivement 8/8 et 1/6 patients avec ou sans précautions d’isolement (pour différentes raisons), ont exprimé une représentation négative de la chambre, avec un sentiment d’emprisonnement, de stigmatisation et de méfiance. Ils ont également signalé un manque d’informations de la part du PS et un besoin de divertissement, d’activités et de visites de proches.

The present study investigated blood metabolites in order to elucidate how infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can lead to such a variety of pathologies and what common ground they share. COVID-19 patient blood samples were taken at hospital admission in two Belgian patient cohorts, and a third cohort that included longitudinal samples was used for additional validation (total n=581). A total of 251 blood metabolite measures and ratios were assessed using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and tested for association to disease severity. In line with the varied effects of severe COVID-19, the range of severity-associated biomarkers was equally broad and included increased inflammatory markers (glycoprotein acetylation), amino acid concentrations (increased leucine and phenylalanine), increased lipoprotein particle concentrations (except those of very low density lipoprotein, VLDL), decreased cholesterol levels (except in large HDL and VLDL), increased triglyceride levels (only in IDL and LDL), fatty acid levels (decreased poly-unsaturated fatty acid, increased mono-unsaturated fatty acid) and decreased choline concentration, with association sizes comparable to those of routine clinical chemistry metrics of acute inflammation.

Study 1 (n = 383) yielded evidence in favour of the absence of an association between mask‐wearing and face‐touching (defined as touches of face or mask), and Study 2 (n = 421) replicated this result. Secondary outcome analysis of the two studies—analysed separately and with pooled data sets—evidenced a negative association between mask‐wearing and hand contact with the face and its t‐zone (i.e. eyes, nose and mouth).

Although people are aware of these diseases, they do not seem to adopt prophylactic methods to prevent them. Here, we propose to investigate the influence of religiosity/spirituality (R/S) on the frequency of the adoption of prophylactic behaviors and the perception of risk of vulnerability to the disease. We used dengue, which is a seasonal arboviral disease in Brazil, as a model. To measure the dimensions of religiosity/spirituality, we used the Portuguese version of the Brief Multidimensional Measure of Religiosity/Spirituality questionnaire. All data were obtained through a structured questionnaire that was answered online by 204 volunteers living throughout Brazil. Our results indicate that R/S is predictive of the frequency of prophylactic behaviors (p = 0.0222, R(2) = 0.025) and the perception of risk of vulnerability (p < 0.05, R(2) = 0.07). We argue that the effect of R/S on health occurs through the promotion of salutogenic mechanisms promoted by socialization in religious environments.

618687,SARS Cov2 infection in a renal transplanted patients. A case report,2020,"People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are at risk for infections that can result in amplification of baseline symptoms and possibly trigger clinical relapses. Vaccination can prevent infection through the activation of humoral and cellular immune responses. This is particularly pertinent in the era of emerging novel vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MS disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), which affect the immune system, may impact immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines in people with MS. The objective of this article is to provide information on immune system responses to vaccinations and review previous studies of vaccine responses in people with MS to support the safety and importance of receiving currently available and emerging COVID-19 vaccines. Immunological studies have shown that coordinated interactions between T and B lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system are key to successful generation of immunological memory and production of neutralizing antibodies following recognition of vaccine antigens by innate immune cells. CD4(+) T cells are essential to facilitate CD8(+) T cell and B cell activation, while B cells drive and sustain T cell memory. Data suggest that some classes of DMT, including type 1 interferons and glatiramer acetate, may not significantly impair the response to vaccination. DMTs—such as sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators, which sequester lymphocytes from circulation; alemtuzumab; and anti-CD20 therapies, which rely on depleting populations of immune cells—have been shown to attenuate responses to conventional vaccines. Currently, three COVID-19 vaccines have been granted emergency use authorization in the USA on the basis of promising interim findings of ongoing trials. Because analyses of these vaccines in people with MS are not available, decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccination and DMT choice should be informed by data and expert consensus, and personalized with considerations for disease burden, risk of infection, and other factors.","Coyle, Patricia K.; Gocke, Anne; Vignos, Megan; Newsome, Scott D.",Adv Ther,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-021-01761-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075554/,245

Les patients traités pour un cancer apparaissent d’autant plus à risque de SSPT qu’ils doivent faire face à la fois à leur pathologie grave et à la peur de développer une forme sévère de COVID-19 dans un contexte social peu favorable pour les soutenir. Dans le cadre de l’étude COVIPACT, notre objectif était de décrire au cours du temps la prévalence des symptômes de SSPT chez les patients atteints de cancer, en lien avec des caractéristiques cliniques (date de diagnostic de cancer, traitements, adaptations de prise en charge liées à la pandémie COVID-19) et des mesures d’état de santé auto-déclarées (qualité de vie, insomnie et cognition). Méthodes L’étude COVIPACT (NCT04366154) a inclus 734 patients traités pour un cancer solide ou hématologique et reçus en hôpital de jour pendant la première période de confinement dans les deux Centres de lutte contre le cancer de Normandie. Les données cliniques ont été recueillies dans les dossiers médicaux. Des questionnaires validés ont permis de mesurer le stress post-traumatique (défini par un score à l’échelle IES-R ≥33), la qualité de vie (FACT-G, échelle 0-108), l’insomnie (ISI, échelle 0-28) et la cognition (FACT-Cog PCI, échelle 0-72) à l’inclusion (pendant le premier confinement, avril/mai 2020), à trois mois (déconfinement, juillet/août 2020) et à six mois (pendant le deuxième confinement, octobre/novembre 2020). Les facteurs associés au SSPT à l’inclusion et à son évolution au cours du temps ont été recherchés par des modèles de régression logistique à effets fixes et mixtes (prenant en compte la corrélation intra-individuelle entre mesures répétées). Résultats Les 578 (79 %) patients COVIPACT ayant répondu aux questionnaires à l’inclusion avaient en médiane 64 ans et 72 % étaient des femmes. Près de 95 % des patients présentaient une tumeur solide, dont la localisation primitive était principalement le sein (44 %), les poumons, la tête et le cou (20 %), le système digestif (17 %) et l’appareil génital féminin (11 %) et dont 59 % avaient un cancer métastatique. Un SSPT a été observé chez 21,3 % des patients au premier confinement (n =120/565), 13,6 % des patients au moment du déconfinement (n =46/339) et 23,5 % des patients durant le deuxième confinement (n =76/322 ; p <0,001 pour effet du temps sur SSPT). Les femmes et les patients dont la prise en charge avait été adaptée face à la pandémie COVID-19 (ex : report/interruption de cures, télé/visio consultations…) présentaient plus fréquemment un SSPT à l’inclusion (OR [IC 95 %]=2,08 [1,26-3,56] et 1,75 [1,12-2,70], respectivement), mais pas au cours du suivi. Aucune autre variable clinique n’était associée au SSPT ou à son évolution. A tous les temps, les patients exprimant un SSPT avaient aussi plus d’insomnie (ISI médian chez les patients avec versus sans SSPT =15 versus 7 à l’inclusion, 15 versus 8 à trois mois, 16 versus 8 à six mois), une moindre qualité de vie (FACT-G médian=61 versus 79, 63 versus 79, 60 versus 80) et une moindre cognition perçue (FACT-Cog PCI=52 versus 66, 55 versus 63, 47 versus 65 à l’inclusion, trois mois et six mois respectivement).

In total, 114 surface and 62 air samples were collected. Bacterial contamination was very low (<1 cfu/cm(2)) on surfaces, whereas the ‘medium’ detected value in air was 282 cfu/m(3). Overall, 19 (16.7%) surface samples tested positive for viral nucleic acids: one for norovirus, one for human adenovirus and 17 (14.9%) for torque teno virus (TTV). Only this latter virus was directly detected in 10 air samples (16.1%). Haemoglobin was found on two surfaces. No relationship was found between viral, biochemical or bacterial indicators. The data obtained confirm the difficulty of assessing viral contamination using bacterial indicators.

Résultats À l’admission, elle avait une dyspnée et des œdèmes des membres inférieurs. Sa pression artérielle était à 120/70mmHg. Au labstix : protéinurie ++ hématurie ++. À la biologie, on a noté une créatinine sérique (Cr) à 1295μmol/L, une anémie avec hémoglobine à 6,5g/dL, protéinurie de 24h à 1,62g, une acidose métabolique sans hypoxémie. Les anticorps anti-membranes basales glomérulaires étaient positifs. L’échographie rénale avait montré deux reins de taille normale. Au scanner pulmonaire : absence de signes d’hémorragie intra-alvéolaire ni de séquelles d’infection. À la PBR : prolifération extracapillaire fibrocellulaire associés à<5 % de fibrose interstitielle et des lésions d’artériosclérose. Le diagnostic de MGP avec atteinte limitée aux reins a été retenu. La patiente a reçu 3 boli IV de solumédrol soit 1g/j pendant 3 jours relayés par une corticothérapie orale à 1mg/kg/jour et cyclophosphamide en bolus IV/15 jours avec des séances d’HD. Deux mois après : reprise de la diurèse, régression des œdèmes et de l’Hm avec amélioration de la fonction rénale (Cr=250μmol/L). Conclusion Certains facteurs environnementaux notamment les infections virales ont été considérés comme associés à la MGP. La surveillance attentive de la fonction rénale au cours et au décours de l’infection par COVID-19, s’avère nécessaire afin de dépister et de traiter à temps toute atteinte rénale selon son étiologie.","Hajji, M.; Dardour, G.; Kharrat, E.; Hedri, H.; Barbouch, S.; Ben Hamida, F.; Gorsane, I.; Abderrahim, E.",Néphrologie & Thérapeutique,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nephro.2021.07.203; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1769725521003667; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1769725521003667,245

China—as both a developing and a transitional economy—represents an important case. This paper uses an international comparative perspective to examine how the health of China’s population and other aspects of health system performance changed during the reform era. We draw on standard public finance and health economics theory, as well as the more recent incomplete-contracting theory of property rights, to summarize the comparative advantages of government and market for financing and delivery of health services, particularly in developing and transitional economies. We then describe and analyze against this theoretical background the transformation of China’s health sector and recent commitment of government funds to move toward universal coverage.","Eggleston, Karen; Wang, Jian; Rao, Keqin",J Asian Econ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049007808000869; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1049007808000869; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asieco.2008.09.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288456/,245

The incidence and clinical impact of coronavirus (CoV) infection in elderly persons and those with underlying cardiopulmonary disease over a long duration is not well described. We determined the incidence and clinical impact of 229E and OC43 CoV in this population during 4 consecutive winters, and compared illnesses to influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus. Methods. CoV 229E and OC43 were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and serology in 4 adult populations under surveillance for acute respiratory illness during the winters of 1999–2003. Cohorts included healthy young adults, healthy elderly adults, high-risk adults with underlying cardiopulmonary disease, and a hospitalized group. Results. Three hundred ninety-eight CoV infections were identified, with annual infection rates ranging from 2.8% to 26% in prospective cohorts, and prevalence ranging from 3.3% to 11.1% in the hospitalized cohort. The incidence of infections with each strain was similar, although asymptomatic infection and viral coinfection was significantly more common with 229E than OC43 infection. Although the incidence and clinical manifestations were similar for each strain, OC43-infected subjects tended to seek more medical care, as OC43 was twice as common as 229E among the hospitalized cohort. Conclusions. CoV infections in the elderly are frequent, likely causing substantial medical disease burden.","Walsh, Edward E.; Shin, Jae Hyun; Falsey, Ann R.",Journal of Infectious Diseases,https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/208/10/1634/2502185/jit393.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23922367/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jit393,245

To assess the validity of the app’s game-based hearing test to estimate changes in hearing levels between audiology appointments. METHOD: This evaluation examined 60 children aged 2–8 with and without OME, attending Cambridge Community Audiology clinics. Children’s performance in the app’s hearing test was compared to their pure tone average (PTA) obtained in clinic. Children and caregivers completed questionnaires after their first interaction with the app, and after one week of using it at home. 18 clinicians completed anonymous questionnaires after trialling the app. RESULTS: Results from the app’s hearing test show a significant correlation with clinic PTA values ([Formula: see text]). 73.1% of caregivers supported their child using the app regularly and 85% thought it enabled them to give more accurate reports to clinicians. After one week, 87.0% of families downloaded and used the app at home, and 85.7% of these felt it provided strategies to help their child. 100% of children liked the app and 93.3% found it easy to use. 77.8% of clinicians supported patients using the app regularly. CONCLUSIONS: Hear Glue Ear is acceptable to children, caregivers and clinicians as part of OME management. The app’s hearing test provides a valid estimate of fluctuating hearing levels.

METHODS: We enrolled 2433 COVID-19 patients and used LASSO regression and multivariable cause-specific Cox proportional hazard models to identify the risk factors for disease progression and fatality. RESULTS: The median time for progression from mild-to-moderate, moderate-to-severe, severe-to-critical, and critical-to-death were 3.0 (interquartile range: 1.8–5.5), 3.0 (1.0–7.0), 3.0 (1.0–8.0), and 6.5 (4.0–16.3) days, respectively. Among 1,758 mild or moderate patients at admission, 474 (27.0%) progressed to a severe or critical stage. Age above 60 years, elevated levels of blood glucose, respiratory rate, fever, chest tightness, c-reaction protein, lactate dehydrogenase, direct bilirubin, and low albumin and lymphocyte count were significant risk factors for progression. Of 675 severe or critical patients at admission, 41 (6.1%) died. Age above 74 years, elevated levels of blood glucose, fibrinogen and creatine kinase-MB, and low plateleta count were significant risk factors for fatality. Patients with elevated blood glucose level were 58% more likely to progress and 3.22 times more likely to die of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Older age, elevated glucose level, and clinical indicators related to systemic inflammatory responses and multiple organ failures, predict both the disease progression and the fatality of COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Wenjun; Shen, Mingwang; Tao, Yusha; Fairley, Christopher K.; Zhong, Qin; Li, Zongren; Chen, Hui; Ong, Jason J.; Zhang, Dawei; Zhang, Kai; Xing, Ning; Guo, Huayuan; Qin, Enqiang; Guan, Xizhou; Yang, Feifei; Zhang, Sibing; Zhang, Lei; He, Kunlun",BMC Pulm Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-021-01413-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33627118/,245

633869,The Clinical Course of COVID-19 in the Outpatient Setting: A Prospective Cohort Study,2021-01-05,"BACKGROUND: In follow-up studies, the occurrence of the intermediate event may influence the risk of the outcome of interest. Existing methods estimate the effect of the intermediate event by including a time-varying covariate in the outcome model. However, the insusceptible fraction to the intermediate event in the study population has not been considered in the literature, leading to effect estimation bias due to the inaccurate dataset. METHODS: In this paper, we propose a new effect estimation method, in which the susceptible subpopulation is identified firstly so that the estimation could be conducted in the right population. Then, the effect is estimated via the extended Cox regression and landmark methods in the identified susceptible subpopulation. For susceptibility identification, patients with observed intermediate event time are classified as susceptible. Based on the mixture cure model fitted the incidence and time of the intermediate event, the susceptibility of the patient with censored intermediate event time is predicted by the residual intermediate event time imputation. The effect estimation performance of the new method was investigated in various scenarios via Monte-Carlo simulations with the performance of existing methods serving as the comparison. The application of the proposed method to mycosis fungoides data has been reported as an example. RESULTS: The simulation results show that the estimation bias of the proposed method is smaller than that of the existing methods, especially in the case of a large insusceptible fraction. The results hold for small sample sizes. Besides, the estimation bias of the new method decreases with the increase of the covariates, especially continuous covariates, in the mixture cure model. The heterogeneity of the effect of covariates on the outcome in the insusceptible and susceptible subpopulation, as well as the landmark time, does not affect the estimation performance of the new method. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the pre-identification of the susceptible, the proposed new method could improve the effect estimation accuracy of the intermediate event on the outcome when there is an insusceptible fraction to the intermediate event in the study population.

Highlights of the progresses include uncovering the modular organization, determining the structures of the structural domains, realizing the roles of protein disorder in protein–protein and protein–nucleic acid interactions, and visualizing the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) structure inside the virions. It was also demonstrated that N-protein binds to nucleic acid at multiple sites with a coupled-allostery manner.

Besides, to evaluate the effects of the activities carried out by the operators participating in the CCM on clinical care. BACKGROUND: Italy is the second country globally for longevity, with 21.4% of citizens over 65 and 6.4% over 80. The CCM fits into this context, a care model aimed primarily at patients suffering from chronic diseases, especially in emergencies, as the recent COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cinahl, and Cochrane Library scientific databases were consulted, and the records selected as relevant by title and abstract by nine independent scholars, and disagreements were resolved through discussion. Finally, the studies included in this review were selected based on the eligibility criteria. RESULTS: Twenty potentially relevant studies were selected, and after applying the eligibility criteria and screening by the Critical Appraisal Skills Program tool, eight included in this review. The studies showed the effectiveness of CCM for managing patients with heart failure in primary care settings and significant improvements in clinical outcomes, the reduction of inappropriate emergency room access for chronic patients, and the improvement of patients’ overall health with diabetes. The CCM organizational model is effective in improving the management of metabolic control and the main cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, this modality also allows doctors to dedicate more space to patients in the disease’s acute phase. CONCLUSION: The CCM, with its fundamental pillars of empowering self-management of care, could represent a valid alternative to health management. The managers of health services, especially territorial ones, could consider the CCM for the improvement of the treatments offered.","Petrelli, Fabio; Cangelosi, Giovanni; Nittari, Giulio; Pantanetti, Paola; Debernardi, Giulia; Scuri, Stefania; Sagaro, Getu Gamo; Nguyen, Cuc Thi Thu; Grappasonni, Iolanda",Prim Health Care Res Dev,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1463423621000268,245

Studies showed that this mutation results in an open conformation of the S glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD), and increased angiotensin 1-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding and fusion, which result in an increase in SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and infectivity. Dynamic tracking of SARS-CoV-2 showed that the D614G variant became predominant after emergence in Europe and North America, but not in China. The current absence of selective pressures from antiviral treatment suggests that the driving force for viral evolution could be variations in human population genetics. Results show that ACE2 expression is higher in Asian populations than that in European, North American, and African populations. This supports the idea that lower ACE2 expression is a driving force in the positive selection for the D614G mutation. This study suggests that the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutation during the early-to-mid pandemic is associated with enhanced transmission efficiency in populations with lower ACE2 expression.

636258,Predicting severe outcomes in COVID-19,2020-06-29,"The high proportion of transmission events derived from asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections make SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent in COVID-19, difficult to control through the traditional non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) of symptom-based isolation and contact tracing. As a consequence, many US universities have developed asymptomatic surveillance testing labs, to augment existing NPIs and control outbreaks on campus. We built a stochastic branching process model of COVID-19 dynamics to advise optimal control strategies in a university environment. Our model combines behavioral interventions in the form of group size limits to deter superspreading, symptom-based isolation, and contact tracing, with asymptomatic surveillance testing. We find that behavioral interventions offer a cost-effective means of epidemic control: group size limits of six or fewer greatly reduce superspreading, and rapid isolation of symptomatic infections can halt rising epidemics, depending on the frequency of asymptomatic transmission in the population. Surveillance testing can overcome uncertainty surrounding asymptomatic infections, with the most effective approaches prioritizing frequent testing with rapid turnaround time to isolation over test sensitivity. Importantly, contact tracing amplifies population-level impacts of all infection isolations, making even delayed interventions effective. Combination of behavior-based NPIs and asymptomatic surveillance also reduces variation in daily case counts to produce more predictable epidemics. Furthermore, targeted, intensive testing of a minority of high transmission risk individuals can effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic for the surrounding population. We offer this blueprint and easy-to-implement modeling tool to other academic or professional communities navigating optimal return-to-work strategies for the 2021 year.","Brook, Cara E.; Northrup, Graham R.; Ehrenberg, Alexander J.; Doudna, Jennifer A.; Boots, Mike",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.12.20230870v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.12.20230870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33442708/,245

It has already taken an enormous number of human lives and had a substantial negative economic impact. Traditional compartmental epidemiological models demonstrated limited ability to predict the scale and dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic in different countries. In order to gain a deeper understanding of its behavior, we turn to chaotic dynamics, which proved fruitful in analyzing previous diseases such as measles. We hypothesize that the unpredictability of the pandemic could be a fundamental property if the disease spread is a chaotic dynamical system. Our mathematical examination of COVID-19 epidemic data in different countries reveals similarity of this dynamic to the chaotic behavior of many dynamics systems, such as logistic maps. We conclude that the data does suggest that the COVID-19 epidemic demonstrates chaotic behavior, which should be taken into account by public policy makers. Furthermore, the scale and behavior of the epidemic may be essentially unpredictable due to the properties of chaotic systems, rather than due to the limited data available for model parameterization.","Andrew, Jones; Nikolay, Strigul",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920307700; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100605/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920307700?v=s5,245
641644,Secondary bacterial infections in critical ill patients of COVID-19,2020-06-05,"A pandemic has developed, so physicians worldwide are particularly interested in the experiences of their Chinese Colleagues which are frequently cited. To assess the long-term pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic, and psychiatric consequences after COVID-19, the outcome of patients included in the early publications and the association with baseline findings is of particular interest. Thus, we review the methods of early Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) publications. Reports published before March 19th 2020, comprising >40 patients were included, considering especially cardiologic aspects. It remains unclear whether patients were described several times, or they were different patients. Only patients with confirmed COVID-19 were described, and no differences in findings of patients with initially suspected and later confirmed, or excluded infection. It remains unclear in how many cases information was missing, since missing values were not reported. Medication before hospital admission, level of education and occupation, household size and composition, weight or body mass index are lacking. No details about electrocardiographic findings are given. Patients still in follow-up, constituting the major part of observations, were excluded. The data should be re-analyzed. A comparison between confirmed and excluded cases could be carried out. By now, in November 2020, the reported patients will most probably have recovered. Thus, it would be possible to differentiate prognostic indicators more precisely. Laboratory tests and electrocardiograms could be analyzed in more detail to shed light on the spectrum of this disease and to solve some of the unanswered questions related with COVID-19.","Stöllberger, Claudia; Winkler-Dworak, Maria",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33425943/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.594623,245

Lung cancer is a heterogenous disease with a wide variety of therapeutic options. Oncologists have to determine the risks and benefits of modifying the treatment plans of patients especially in situation where the disease biology and treatment are complex. Health care visits carry a risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the similarities of COVID-19 symptoms and lung cancer manifestations represent a dominant problem. Efforts to modify treatment of lung cancer during the current pandemic have been adapted by many healthcare institutes to reduce exposure of lung cancer patients to SARS-CoV-2.

644194,The BAS²IC score: a useful tool to identify patients at high risk of early progression to severe COVID-19,2020-09-01,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was caused by a newly identified coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) in 2003. To detect early SARS‐CoV infection, a one‐step, real‐time quantitative reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) assay was developed that could simultaneously detect nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and spike (S) genes of SARS‐CoV with the same PCR condition using either Applied Biosystems (ABI) Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System or Roche LightCycler. The sensitivity of this assay was evaluated using cell culture‐derived viruses, in vitro transcribed viral RNA, and clinical specimens. The SARS‐S, ‐M, and ‐N primer/probe sets described in this paper could detect one to ten copies of in vitro transcribed S, M, and N RNA per test using both the ABI and Roche assay systems. The relative sensitivities for detecting cell culture‐derived SARS‐CoV were 0.01, 0.01, and 0.001 PFU/test, respectively. It showed that SARS‐N has comparable detection efficiencies to SARS2 and SARS3 which are primers sets designed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, SARS‐S and SARS‐M also demonstrated equivalent sensitivity to the commercially available RealArt HPA‐Coronavirus reagents (Artus). The relative sensitivity of these primer/probe sets was also examined using human sera spiked viruses and clinical specimens from four confirmed SARS patients. Similar results as above were obtained. Specificity tests and sequence alignment showed that these primer/probe sets annealed perfectly to 31 isolates of SARS‐CoV; and there was no cross detection with other coronaviruses and human respiratory tract‐associated viruses. Therefore, not only is it compatible with the ABI and Roche systems, this multiple‐gene detection assay also has the merit of being a rapid, safe, sensitive, and specific tool for accurate diagnosis of SARS‐CoV infection.

To find out the location of corona virus mutations of one type to another, DNA sequences can be aligned using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. Corona virus data was taken from Genbank National Center for Biotechnology Information from 1985-1992. The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a global alignment algorithm in which alignment is performed to all sequences with the complexity of O (mn) and is capable of producing optimal alignment. An important step in this reserach is the sequence alignment of two corona viruses using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. Second, identification of the location of mutations from the DNA of the virus. The result of this reserach is an alignment and the location of mutations of both sequences. The results of identification DNA mutation can be used to find out other viruses mutation corona virus as well as can be used in the field of health as a reference for the manufacture of drugs for corona virus mutation outcome.","Isa Irawan, Mohammad; Mukhlash, Imam; Rizky, Abduh; Ririsati Dewi, Alfiana",J Phys Conf Ser,https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1218/1/012031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288776/,245

However, whether obesity is a risk factor for contracting COVID-19 has been hardly investigated so far. METHODS: We examined the association between BMI level and the risk of COVID-19 infection in a nationwide case-control study comprised of 3,788 case patients confirmed with COVID-19 between January 24 and April 9, 2020 and 15,152 controls matched by age and sex, who were aged 20 years or more and underwent National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) health examinations between 2015−2017, using data from the Korean NHIS with linkage to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Our primary exposure of interest was BMI level categorized into four groups; &18.5 (underweight), 18.5-22.9 (normal weight), 23-24.9 (overweight), and ≥25 kg/m (2) (obese). RESULTS: Of the entire 18,940 study population, 11,755 (62.1%) were women, and the mean (SD) age of the study participants was 53.7 (13.8) years. In multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic, comorbidity, laboratory and medication data, there was a graded association between higher BMI levels and higher risk of COVID-19 infection; compared to normal weight individuals, the adjusted ORs in the overweight and obese individuals were 1.13 (95% CI, 1.03-1.25) and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.15-1.39), respectively. This association was robust across age and sex subgroups.

Methods and materials We have undertaken a rapid review of published literature on the role of radiotherapy in the multimodality treatment of paediatric cancers governing the European practice of paediatric radiotherapy. The derived data has been discussed with expert paediatric radiation oncologists to derive a hierarchy of recommendations. Results The general recommendations to mitigate the potential detriment of an unexpected shortage of radiotherapy facilities include: (1) maintain current standards of care as long as possible (2) refer to another specialist paediatric radiotherapy department with similar level of expertise (3) prioritise use of existing radiotherapy resources to treat patients with tumours where radiotherapy has the most effect on clinical outcome (4) use chemotherapy to defer the start of radiotherapy where timing of radiotherapy is not expected to be detrimental (5) active surveillance for low-grade tumours if appropriate and (6) consider iso-effective hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens only for selected patients with predicted poor prognosis. The effectiveness of radiotherapy and recommendations for prioritisation of its use for common and challenging paediatric tumours are discussed. Conclusion This review provides evidence-based treatment recommendations during unexpected shortage of paediatric radiotherapy facilities. It has wider applications for the optimal utilization of facilities, to improve clinical outcome in low- and middle-income countries, where limited resources continue to be a challenge.","Janssens, Geert O.; Mandeville, Henry C.; Timmermann, Beate; Maduro, John H.; Alapetite, Claire; Padovani, Laetitia; Horan, Gail; Lassen-Ramshad, Yasmin; Dieckmann, Karin; Ruebe, Christian; Thorp, Nicky; Gandola, Lorenza; Ajithkumar, Thankamma; Boterberg, Tom",Radiother Oncol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167814020302164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32342872/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167814020302164?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2020.04.035,245

Overall, 599 people participated (320 female, median age 53 years) and most had experienced an acute COVID-19 with mild illness (409, 68.3%). The majority were hesitant or undecided towards influenza (327, 54.6%) and SARS-CoV-2 (353, 59.2%) vaccines. Older age, public work exposure, and previous 2019 flu shots were the main factors associated with a positive attitude toward both vaccinations (p < 0.05). Being hospitalized during the acute COVID-19 phase was associated with the willingness to get a flu shot (94/272, 34.5%) but not SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (70/244, 28.7%).

Using county-level data, 42 negative binomial mixed models were used to evaluate the impact of social determinants on COVID-19 outcome. First, to identify proper controls, the effect of 24 high-risk factors on COVID-19 mortality rate was quantified. Then, the high-risk terms found to be significant were controlled for in an association study between 41 social determinants and COVID-19 mortality rates. The results describe that ethnic minorities, immigrants, socioeconomic inequalities, and early exposure to COVID-19 are associated with increased COVID-19 mortality, while the prevalence of asthma, suicide, and excessive drinking is associated with decreased mortality. Overall, we recognize that social inequality places disadvantaged groups at risk, which must be addressed through future policies and pro-grams. Additionally, we reveal possible relationships between lung disease, mental health, and COVID-19 that need to be explored on a clinical level.","Debopadhaya, Shayom; Sprague, Ariella D; Mou, Hongxi; Benavides, Tiburon L; Ahn, Sarah M; Reschke, Cole A; Erickson, John S; Bennett, Kristin P",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.28.20183848; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.28.20183848v1?rss=1,245

The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity. We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model. However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs. Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC(50)) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC(50). The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model. Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging CoVs.","Agostini, Maria L.; Andres, Erica L.; Sims, Amy C.; Graham, Rachel L.; Sheahan, Timothy P.; Lu, Xiaotao; Smith, Everett Clinton; Case, James Brett; Feng, Joy Y.; Jordan, Robert; Ray, Adrian S.; Cihlar, Tomas; Siegel, Dustin; Mackman, Richard L.; Clarke, Michael O.; Baric, Ralph S.; Denison, Mark R.",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00221-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29511076/,245

(2013) Amaryllidaceae alkaloids inhibit nuclear‐to‐cytoplasmic export of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 7(6), 922–931. Background Few drugs are currently licensed to treat influenza A infection, and new therapies are needed, especially for highly pathogenic strains. Traditional medicinal plants, such as Lycoris radiata, are a potential source of new antiviral agents. Objective To test 15 Amaryllidaceae alkaloids isolated from the bulbs of L. radiata in vitro for antiviral activities against influenza virus type A, A/Chicken/GuangDong/178/2004 (H5N1, 178). Methods Antiviral activities of the compounds were tested in time‐of‐addition assays, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays, neuraminidase (NA) activity assays, and viral entry inhibition assays using H5N1‐HIV pseudoviruses. Effects of the compounds on localization and activity of the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) were determined by immunofluorescence and an RNP minigenome assay, respectively. Results Among the alkaloids, lycorine (AA1), hippeastrine (AA2), hemanthamine (AA3) and 11‐hydroxy vittatine (AA4) exhibited antiviral activities, with EC(90) values of 0·52, 82·07, 4·15, and 13·45 μm, respectively. These compounds did not affect the function of the outer membrane proteins or the viral entry process and viral RNP activity. As AA1 and AA3 exhibited stronger antiviral activities, they were further analyzed. Intracellular nucleoprotein (NP) localization showed that AA1 and AA3 inhibited the RNP complex in the nucleus at an early stage of a single‐round and multi‐round of replication. Conclusion Four Amaryllidaceae alkaloids were first determined that could exert anti‐influenza activities after virus entry into cells. Furthermore, AA1 and AA3 could inhibit nuclear‐to‐cytoplasmic export of the RNP complex of virus replication. Thus, these compounds may be developed further as anti‐influenza drug candidates.","He, Jun; Qi, Wen‐Bao; Wang, Lei; Tian, Jin; Jiao, Pei‐Rong; Liu, Guo‐Qian; Ye, Wen‐Cai; Liao, Ming",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23136954/,245

Several studies have investigated cellular immune responses in COVID‐19‐infected patients during disease but little is known regarding a possible protracted impact of COVID‐19 on the adaptive and innate immune system in COVID‐19 convalescent patients. METHODS: We used multiparametric flow cytometry to analyze whole peripheral blood samples and determined SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific antibody levels against the S‐protein, its RBD‐subunit, and viral nucleocapsid in a cohort of COVID‐19 convalescent patients who had mild disease ~10 weeks after infection (n = 109) and healthy control subjects (n = 98). Furthermore, we correlated immunological changes with clinical and demographic parameters. RESULTS: Even ten weeks after disease COVID‐19 convalescent patients had fewer neutrophils, while their cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells were activated, reflected as higher HLA‐DR and CD38 expression. Multiparametric regression analyses showed that in COVID‐19‐infected patients both CD3(+)CD4(+) and CD3(+)CD8(+) effector memory cells were higher, while CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells were lower. In addition, both transitional B cell and plasmablast levels were significantly elevated in COVID‐19‐infected patients. Fever (duration, level) correlated with numbers of central memory CD4(+) T cells and anti‐S and anti‐RBD, but not anti‐NC antibody levels.

It is a low-cost beneficial intervention that is vital in improving quality of care during labour and delivery. LOCAL PROBLEM: Despite the available evidence on benefits of birth companion, there was no policy on allowing birth companion at our hospital in the past. METHODS AND INTERVENTIONS: We aimed to establish the practice of allowing birth companions in all eligible women in labour ward from existing 0% to 50% in 6 weeks’ duration. This study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. A quality improvement (QI) team was formed, and after obtaining the baseline data, problems were analysed using fish bone chart. A new policy of allowing birth companion was made and efforts made to sensitise and train the doctors and nurses posted in labour ward. Changed ideas were executed in multiple plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles. Simple interventions such as dress code for birth companions, curtains for ensuring privacy, display of posters and frequent reminders on WhatsApp groups were planned. RESULTS: The median value of women accompanied by birth companion marginally increased to 25% after the first PDSA cycle. Implementation of further changed ideas led to increase in median, which reached 66.6%. Thereafter, there was a decline, but by the end of 6 months, it was possible to attain the goal and sustain it. CONCLUSIONS: Simple steps of QI methodology can be used to address the prevalent problems in our healthcare. Implementation of any new practice comes with major challenges, but we could achieve our goal because of a motivated team working together on multiple changed ideas applied sequentially in PDSA cycles.","Bharti, Juhi; Kumari, Aprajita; Zangmo, Rinchen; Mathew, Sonia; Kumar, Sunesh; Sharma, Aparna K",BMJ Open Qual,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34344753/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2021-001409,245

METHODS: An open-label, randomized, and controlled trial was conducted on patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. The 55 patients of the control group receiving hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir / ritonavir were compared with the 56 patients of the case group who in addition to the same regimen were also receiving azithromycin. Patients with prior cardiac disease were excluded from the study. Furthermore, patients from the case group were assessed for cardiac arrythmia risk based on the American college of cardiology (ACC) risk assessment for use of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. The main outcome measures were vital signs, SpO2 levels, duration of hospitalization, need for and length of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality rates, and results of 30-day follow-up after discharge. RESULTS: Initially, there was no significant difference between the general conditions and vital signs of the two groups. The SpO2 levels at discharge were significantly higher, the respiratory rate was lower, and the duration of admission was shorter in the case group. There was no significant difference in the mortality rate between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Patients who received azithromycin in addition to the hydroxychloroquine and Kaletra regimen had a better general condition. he hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination may be beneficial for individuals who are known to have a very low underlying risk for cardiac arrhythmias based on the ACC criteria.","Sekhavati, Ehsan; Jafari, Fatemeh; SeyedAlinaghi, SeyedAhmad; Siahkali, Saeidreza Jamali Moghadam; Sadr, Sara; Tabarestani, Mohammad; Pirhayati, Mohammad; Zendehdel, Abolfazl; Manafi, Navid; Hajiabdolbaghi, Mahboubeh; Ahmadinejad, Zahra; Kouchak, Hamid Emadi; Jafari, Sirous; Khalili, Hosein; Salehi, Mohamadreza; Seifi, Arash; Golestan, Fereshteh Shahmari; Ghiasvand, Fereshteh",Int J Antimicrob Agents,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920303411?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106143; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857920303411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32853672/,245

664818,Host genetics of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children,2021,"BACKGROUND: As a new emerging infectious disease pandemic, there is an urgent need to understand the dynamics of COVID-19 in each country to inform planning of emergency measures to contain its spread. It is essential that appropriate disease control activities are planned and implemented in a timely manner. Thailand was one of the first countries outside China to be affected with subsequent importation and domestic spread in most provinces in the country. METHOD: A key ingredient to guide planning and implementation of public health measures is a metric of transmissibility which represents the infectiousness of a disease. Ongoing policies can utilize this information to plan appropriately with updated estimates of disease transmissibility. Therefore we present descriptive analyses and preliminary statistical estimation of reproduction numbers over time and space to facilitate disease control activities in Thailand. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproduction number for COVID-19 during the study ranged from 2.23–5.90, with a mean of 3.75. We also tracked disease dynamics over time using temporal and spatiotemporal reproduction numbers. The results suggest that the outbreak was under control since the middle of April. After the boxing stadium and entertainment venues, the numbers of new cases had increased and spread across the country. DISCUSSION: Although various scenarios about assumptions were explored in this study, the real situation was difficult to determine given the limited data. More thorough mathematical modelling would be helpful to improve the estimation of transmissibility metrics for emergency preparedness as more epidemiological and clinical information about this new infection becomes available. However, the results can be used to guide interventions directly and to help parameterize models to predict the impact of these interventions.","Rotejanaprasert, Chawarat; Lawpoolsri, Saranath; Pan-ngum, Wirichada; Maude, Richard J.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32970773/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239645,245

Here, we used publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences from both humans and minks collected in Denmark and Netherlands, and combined phylogenetic analysis with Bayesian inference under an epidemiological model to trace the possibility of person-to-person transmission. The results showed that at least 12.5% of all people being infected with dominated mink-derived SARS-CoV-2 variants in Denmark and Netherlands were caused by human-to-human transmission, indicating this “back-to-human” SARS-CoV-2 variant has already caused human-to-human transmission. Our study also indicated the need for monitoring this mink-derived and other animal source “back-to-human” SARS-CoV-2 in future and that prevention and control measures should be tailored to avoid large-scale community transmission caused by the virus jumped between animals and humans.","Wang, Liang; Didelot, Xavier; Bi, Yuhai; Gao, George F.",Innovation (N Y),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666675821000539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34124706/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666675821000539?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xinn.2021.100128,245

At present, the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is made through a nasopharyngeal swab based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. However, some recent studies suggested the possible role of oral fluids and saliva in the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The purpose of this scoping review is evaluating the available evidence regarding the efficacy of saliva as a diagnostic specimen in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic literature review of six databases (PubMed, Scopus, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL], Science Direct, Web of Science and Google scholar) was carried out without any restrictions on date of publication to identify the reliability of saliva as a diagnostic specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in suspected patients. RESULTS: Nine eligible articles were included in this review based on our described method. All the included studies are based on clinical surveys among patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most of studies included in this review, reported that there is no statistically significant difference between nasopharyngeal or sputum specimens and saliva samples regarding viral load.

To address the rising STI rates in the Denver Metro Area (DMA), leaders at the Denver Prevention Training Center (DPTC), Denver Public Health, and the Colorado Department of Health and Environment (CDPHE) supported the establishment of the Denver Metro STI Coalition (DMSC), a collective impact group. Collective impact groups have a history of success in aiding public health crises, most notably the HIV epidemic, but have not been extensively used to address the ongoing U.S. STI epidemic. We discuss the development of an STI collective impact group to increase local communication and collaboration to support high quality, accessible STI care and reduce STI health disparities in our jurisdiction. Approach DMSC members were recruited from health care and community-based organizations engaged in STI services in DMA. This report summarizes DMSC progress from its initial meeting on 11/2019 to 3/2021. Outcomes/Impact DMSC participation has included 106 individuals from 20 health care and community-based organizations. DMSC has conducted four quarterly general assembly meetings. DMSC has facilitated member education through its quarterly meetings, group emails, and DMSC Groupsite shared documents. Shared education and resources have included information on STI epidemiology, STI testing shortages, CDC STI updates, and local STI health alerts. DMSC workgroups have developed products including a one-page congenital syphilis infographic highlighting jurisdictional epidemiology and treatment algorithms, including state specific recommendations for universal third trimester syphilis screening during pregnancy and a provider counseling guide for safe sex during COVID-19. Innovation The DMSC has provided a structure for leveraging local partnerships, sharing information, expanding healthcare provider STI knowledge and improving STI infrastructure in the metropolitan area.

DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective cohort study. SETTING: One Level 1 trauma center and one orthopaedic specialty hospital in New York City. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-nine consecutive patients (average age 85 years, range: 65–100 years) treated for a hip fracture (OTA/AO 31, 32.1) over a 5-week period, March 20, 2020, to April 24, 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 crisis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: COVID-19 infection status was used to stratify patients. The primary outcome was inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes were admission to the intensive care unit, unexpected intubation, pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, urinary tract infection, and transfusion. Baseline demographics, comorbidities, treatment characteristics, and COVID-related symptomatology were also evaluated. RESULTS: Ten patients (15%) tested positive for COVID-19 (COVID+) (n = 9; 7 preoperatively and 2 postoperatively) or were presumed positive (n = 1), 40 (68%) patients tested negative, and 9 (15%) patients were not tested in the primary hospitalization. American Society of Anesthesiologists' scores were higher in the COVID+ group (d = −0.83; P = 0.04); however, the Charlson Comorbidity Index was similar between the study groups (d = −0.17; P = 0.63). Inpatient mortality was significantly increased in the COVID+ cohort (56% vs. 4%; odds ratio 30.0, 95% confidence interval 4.3–207; P = 0.001).

The preventive effects of these bioactive ingredients against various diseases have been well investigated. Functional foods are consumed across various diverse cultures, in some form or the other, which provide benefits greater than the basic nutritional needs. Novel functional foods are being developed using novel bioactive ingredients such as probiotics, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and various phytoconstituents, which have a range of immunomodulatory properties. Apart from immunomodulation, these ingredients also affect immunity by their antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. The global pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 has forced the scientific community to race against time to find a proper and effective drug or a vaccine. In this review, various non-pharmacological interventions using nutraceuticals and functional foods have been discussed. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Despite a plethora of research being undertaken to understand the immunity boosting properties of the various bioactive present in food, the findings are not translating to nutraceutical products in the market. Immunity has proved to be one of the most important factors for the health and well-being of an individual, especially when the world has been under the grip of the novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2. The anti-inflammatory properties of various nutraceuticals can come out as potential inhibitors of the various inflammatory processes such as cytokine storms, usually being observed in COVID 19. This review gives an insight into how various nutraceuticals can help in the prevention of various diseases through different mechanisms. The lack of awareness and proper clinical trials pose a challenge to the nutraceutical industry. This review will help and encourage researchers to further design and develop various functional foods, which might help in building immunity.","Basak, Somnath; Gokhale, Jyoti",J Food Biochem,https://doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.13902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34467553/,245

We investigated the feasibility of undertaking CPET and the relationship between CPET and quality of life measurements in a well-defined population of mild and moderate IPF patients. METHODS: A prospective, single-centre observational study. RESULTS: Thirty-two IPF patients (mild n = 23, moderate n = 9) participated in the study, n = 13 mild patients attended for repeat CPET testing at 12 months. At baseline, total K-BILD scores and total IPF-PROM scores significantly correlated with 6MWT distance, but not with baseline FVC % predicted, TLco % predicted, baseline or minimum SpO(2). VO(2) peak/kg at AT positively correlated with total scores, breathlessness/activity and chest domains of the K-BILD questionnaire (p < 0.05). VO(2) peak significantly correlated with total IPF PROM scores and wellbeing domains (p < 0.05), with a trend towards statistical significance for total IPF-PROM and VO(2) peak/kg at anaerobic threshold (p = 0.06). There was a statistically significant reduction in FVC% predicted at 12 months follow up, although the mean absolute decline was < 10% (p < 0.05). During this period VO(2) peak significantly reduced (21.6 ml/kg/min ± 2.9 vs 19.1 ± 2.8; p = 0.017), with corresponding reductions in total K-BILD and breathlessness/activity domains that exceeded the MCID for responsiveness. Lower baseline VO(2) peak/kg at anaerobic threshold correlated with greater declines in total K-BILD scores (r = − 0.62, 0.024) at 12 months. Whilst baseline FVC% predicted or TLco % predicted did not predict change in health status, CONCLUSION: We have shown that it is feasible to undertake CPET in patients with mild to moderate IPF. CPET measures of VO(2) peak correlated with both baseline and change in K-BILD measurements at 1 year, despite relatively stable standard lung function (declines of < 10% in FVC), suggesting its potential sensitivity to detect physiological changes underlying health status.

Reverse vaccinology (RV) is a state-of-the-art technique to predict vaccine candidates from pathogen's genome(s). To promote vaccine development, we updated Vaxign2, the first web-based vaccine design program using reverse vaccinology with machine learning. Vaxign2 is a comprehensive web server for rational vaccine design, consisting of predictive and computational workflow components. The predictive part includes the original Vaxign filtering-based method and a new machine learning-based method, Vaxign-ML. The benchmarking results using a validation dataset showed that Vaxign-ML had superior prediction performance compared to other RV tools. Besides the prediction component, Vaxign2 implemented various post-prediction analyses to significantly enhance users’ capability to refine the prediction results based on different vaccine design rationales and considerably reduce user time to analyze the Vaxign/Vaxign-ML prediction results. Users provide proteome sequences as input data, select candidates based on Vaxign outputs and Vaxign-ML scores, and perform post-prediction analysis. Vaxign2 also includes precomputed results from approximately 1 million proteins in 398 proteomes of 36 pathogens. As a demonstration, Vaxign2 was used to effectively analyse SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus causing COVID-19. The comprehensive framework of Vaxign2 can support better and more rational vaccine design.

Although considerable research has focused on this important pathogen, little is known about the function of most PRRSV proteins. To examine characteristics of putative nonstructural proteins (nsp) encoded in ORF1b, which have been identified by nucleotide similarity to domains of equine arteritis virus, defined genomic regions were cloned and expressed in the pRSET expression system. One region, nsp10, encoded a protein with a putative helicase domain and was further examined for functional helicase-like activities. PRRSV nsp10 was found to possess a thermolabile and pH-sensitive NTPase activity that was modulated by polynucleotides and to unwind dsRNA in a 5′ to 3′ polarity. These results provide the first evidence of the functional properties of PRRSV helicase and further support the finding that nidovirus helicases possess properties that distinguish them from other viral helicases.","Bautista, Elida M.; Faaberg, Kay S.; Mickelson, Dan; McGruder, Edward D.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12127789/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682202914959; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682202914959,245

674321,"A Case of Steroid-Responsive, COVID-19 Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome Following the Use of Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor",2020-08-17,"The COVID‐19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented demand for real‐time surveillance data in order to inform critical decision makers regarding the management of the pandemic. The aim of this review was to describe how the Danish national microbiology database, MiBa, served as a cornerstone for providing data to the real‐time surveillance system by linkage to other nationwide health registries. The surveillance system was established on an existing IT health infrastructure and a close network between clinical microbiologists, information technology experts, and public health officials. In 2020, testing capacity for SARS‐CoV‐2 was ramped up from none to over 10,000 weekly PCR tests per 100,000 population. The crude incidence data mirrored this increase in testing. Real‐time access to denominator data and patient registries enabled adjustments for fluctuations testing activity, providing robust data on crude SARS‐CoV‐2 incidence during the changing diagnostic and management strategies. The use of the same data for different purposes, for example, final laboratory reports, information to the public, contact tracing, public health, and science, has been a critical asset for the pandemic response. It has also raised issues concerning data protection and critical capacity of the underlying technical systems and key resources. However, even with these limitations, the setup has enabled decision makers to adopt timely interventions. The experiences from COVID‐19 may motivate a transformation from traditional indicator‐based public health surveillance to an all‐encompassing information system based on access to a comprehensive set of data sources, including diagnostic and reference microbiology.","Schønning, Kristian; Dessau, Ram Benny; Jensen, Thøger Gorm; Thorsen, Nicklas Myrthue; Wiuff, Camilla; Nielsen, Lene; Gubbels, Sophie; Denwood, Matt; Thygesen, Uffe Høgsbro; Christensen, Lasse Engbo; Møller, Camilla Holten; Møller, Jens Kjølseth; Ellermann‐Eriksen, Svend; Østergaard, Christian; Lam, Janni Uyen Hoa; Abushalleeh, Nour; Meaidi, Marianna; Olsen, Stefan; Mølbak, Kåre; Voldstedlund, Marianne",APMIS,https://doi.org/10.1111/apm.13140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33949007/,245

Influenza studies have shown that influenza viruses survive longer on surfaces or in droplets in cold and dry air, thus increasing the likelihood of subsequent transmission. A similar hypothesis has been postulated for the transmission of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is important to propose methodologies to understand the effects of environmental factors on this ongoing outbreak to support decision-making pertaining to disease control. Here, we examine the spatial variability of the basic reproductive numbers of COVID-19 across provinces and cities in China and show that environmental variables alone cannot explain this variability. Our findings suggest that changes in weather (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the Northern Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in case counts without the implementation of drastic public health interventions.","Poirier, Canelle; Luo, Wei; Majumder, Maimuna S.; Liu, Dianbo; Mandl, Kenneth D.; Mooring, Todd A.; Santillana, Mauricio",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74089-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33046802/,245

Whereas, a large amount of evidence on harm to children from conventional cigarette exposure is available, data on health effects in this population throughout different vulnerability windows are still a matter of concern. Exposure to EC during pregnancy may compromise placental function, resulting in fetal structural abnormalities. Specifically, this may cause physio-pathologic changes in the developing lung, which in turn may impair respiratory health later in life. Furthermore, there is evidence that using EC can cause both short- and long-term respiratory problems in the pediatric population and there is great concern for future young people with nicotine addiction. The low parental perception of the risks connected to EC exposure for children increases their susceptibility to harmful effects from passive vaping. This minireview aims to summarize the current evidence focusing on: (i) prenatal effects of EC passive exposure; (ii) post-natal respiratory effects of EC exposure in youth; (iii) parental attitudes toward EC use and perception of children's health risks connected to EC exposure; and (iv) addressing gaps in our current evidence.","Mescolo, Federica; Ferrante, Giuliana; La Grutta, Stefania",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34513764/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.711573,245

Given its health benefits, there is a need to explore strategies to increase PA rates during this period. Video-conferencing platforms can be used to deliver live, online, group PA sessions. However, there are only few established PA protocols on how to use such platforms. Hence, the purposes of this study were to (a) design an online PA protocol and (b) explore its feasibility among older adults during a quarantine. A group of exercise specialists developed a PA protocol while accounting for challenges that may arise when using a video-conferencing platform (“Zoom”). A special focus was placed on safety, individualization, and motivational aspects. Then, 31 community dwelling older adults (71.5 ± 4 years) were recruited via social media to follow this protocol twice a week for 8 weeks. Outcome measures included adverse events, adherence rates, and satisfaction with the protocol, its delivery, and technological aspects. Twenty-eight participants completed the protocol. No adverse events occurred, and adherence rates were high (90%). Most participants (97%) indicated they would participate in such a program in the future and highly rated all aspects of the protocol (median score >6 in 1–7 Likert scales). The PA protocol delivered live via a video-conferencing platform was found to be safe and feasible with this cohort. It can therefore be implemented in practice, and in future studies planning to utilize home-based PA sessions for older adults.","Schwartz, Hadar; Har-Nir, Itai; Wenhoda, Tamar; Halperin, Israel",Transl Behav Med,https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibaa141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33447852/,245

Existing treatments that can be repurposed as prophylactic and therapeutic agents may reduce the pandemic’s devastation. Emerging evidence of potential applications in other therapeutic contexts has led to the investigation of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals for COVID-19. Such products include vitamin C, vitamin D, omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, probiotics, and zinc, all of which are currently under clinical investigation. In this review, we critically appraise the evidence surrounding dietary supplements and nutraceuticals for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. Overall, further study is required before evidence-based recommendations can be formulated, but nutritional status plays a significant role in patient outcomes, and these products may help alleviate deficiencies. For example, evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with a greater incidence of infection and severity of COVID-19, suggesting that vitamin D supplementation may hold prophylactic or therapeutic value. A growing number of scientific organizations are now considering recommending vitamin D supplementation to those at high risk of COVID-19. Because research in vitamin D and other nutraceuticals and supplements is preliminary, here we evaluate the extent to which these nutraceutical and dietary supplements hold potential in the COVID-19 crisis. IMPORTANCE Sales of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals have increased during the pandemic due to their perceived “immune-boosting” effects. However, little is known about the efficacy of these dietary supplements and nutraceuticals against the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) or the disease that it causes, CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review provides a critical overview of the potential prophylactic and therapeutic value of various dietary supplements and nutraceuticals from the evidence available to date. These include vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc, which are often perceived by the public as treating respiratory infections or supporting immune health. Consumers need to be aware of misinformation and false promises surrounding some supplements, which may be subject to limited regulation by authorities. However, considerably more research is required to determine whether dietary supplements and nutraceuticals exhibit prophylactic and therapeutic value against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. This review provides perspective on which nutraceuticals and supplements are involved in biological processes that are relevant to recovery from or prevention of COVID-19.","Lordan, Ronan; Rando, Halie M.; Greene, Casey S.",mSystems,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02250v1.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1128/msystems.00122-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33947804/,245

The aim of the workshop was to discuss the latest trends in using high-throughput sequencing, bioinformatics, and allied technologies to analyze immune and pathogen repertoires and their interplay within the host, bringing together key international players in the field and Singapore-based researchers and clinician-scientists. The focus was in particular on the application of these technologies for the improvement of patient diagnosis, prognosis and treatment, and for other broad public health outcomes. The presentations by scientists and clinicians showed the potential of deep sequencing technology to capture the coevolution of adaptive immunity and pathogens. For clinical applications, some key challenges remain, such as the long turnaround time and relatively high cost of deep sequencing for pathogen identification and characterization and the lack of international standardization in immune repertoire analysis.","Burkholder, William F.; Newell, Evan W.; Poidinger, Michael; Chen, Swaine; Fink, Katja",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28620372/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00593,245

COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with a range of clinical symptoms, including cough, fever, chills, headache, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, and a loss of smell or taste. Aged individuals with compromised immunity are highly susceptible to COVID-19 and the likelihood of mortality increases with age and the presence of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 highjacks mitochondria of immune cells, replicates within mitochondrial structures, and impairs mitochondrial dynamics leading to cell death. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell and are largely involved in maintaining cell immunity, homeostasis, and cell survival/death. Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondria from COVID-19 infected cells are highly vulnerable, and vulnerability increases with age. The purpose of our article is to summarize the role of various age-related comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, and neurological diseases in increasing mortality rates amongst the elderly with COVID-19. Our article also highlights the interaction between coronavirus and mitochondrial dynamics in immune cells. We also highlight the current treatments, lifestyles, and safety measures that can help protect against COVID-19. Further research is urgently needed to understand the molecular mechanisms between the mitochondrial virus and disease progression in COVID-19 patients.","Ganji, Riya; Reddy, P.

683402,Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Mimicking Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated With COVID-19: A Diagnostic Challenge,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The SARS-CoV2 infection is associated with high mortality for individuals who undergo emergency surgery. The United Kingdom surgical associations and Colleges of Surgeons collectively recommended the addition of CT Thorax to all emergency CT abdomen/pelvis imaging in order to help identify possible COVID-19 patients. Early identification of these patients would lead to optimal treatment strategies for the patient and protection for staff members. However, an extension of CT would be associated with increased irradiation doses for the patient, and its diagnostic relevance was unclear. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational review looking at all surgical admissions that required a CT Thorax/Abdomen/Pelvis across 7 weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic, across four Scottish Hospitals. CT thorax investigations (of non-surgical patients) were also re-assessed by a single radiologist to assess the extent of pathology identified at the lung bases (and therefore would be included in a standard CT abdomen and pelvis). RESULTS: Of 216 patients identified who had a CT thorax/Abdomen/Pelvis during the timeframe, 5 were diagnosed with COVID-19. During this timeframe, 77 patients underwent solely CT thorax. Across the entire cohort, 98% of COVID pathology was identified at the lung bases. The estimated sensitivity and specificity of CT thorax was 60 and 86.4% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In a region with relatively low prevalence of SARS-COV2 infection, inclusion of CT Thorax in surgical admission imaging does not significantly contribute to identification and management of SARS-COV2 patients. We therefore suggest that imaging the lung bases can be sufficient to raise clinical suspicion of COVID-19. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This paper adds further evidence to that from other single UK centres that the addition of CT chest for all patients does not yield any further diagnostic information regarding coronavirus. Additionally, rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing in the UK (which is currently widely available) further demonstrates that inclusion of the entire chest during CT examination of the acute abdomen is not required.","Brennan, Christopher Anthony; Morrissey, Brian; Dubois-Marshall, Sylvie; McAteer, Dympna; Qadir, Abdul; Ramsay, George",BJR Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33367199/; https://doi.org/10.1259/bjro.20200044,245
684222,Does asthma affect morbidity or severity of Covid-19?,2020-05-26,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus (DENV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) belong to the family Flaviviridae. Their viral particles have the envelope composed of viral proteins and a lipid bilayer acquired from budding through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The phospholipid content of the ER membrane differs from that of the plasma membrane (PM). The phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) superfamily consists of a large number of members that specifically catalyse the hydrolysis of phospholipids at a particular position. Here we show that the CM-II isoform of secreted PLA(2) obtained from Naja mossambica mossambica snake venom (CM-II-sPLA(2)) possesses potent virucidal (neutralising) activity against HCV, DENV and JEV, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of 0.036, 0.31 and 1.34 ng/ml, respectively. In contrast, the IC(50) values of CM-II-sPLA(2) against viruses that bud through the PM (Sindbis virus, influenza virus and Sendai virus) or trans-Golgi network (TGN) (herpes simplex virus) were >10,000 ng/ml. Moreover, the 50% cytotoxic (CC(50)) and haemolytic (HC(50)) concentrations of CM-II-sPLA(2) were >10,000 ng/ml, implying that CM-II-sPLA(2) did not significantly damage the PM. These results suggest that CM-II-sPLA(2) and its derivatives are good candidates for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that target viral envelope lipid bilayers derived from the ER membrane.","Chen, Ming; Aoki-Utsubo, Chie; Kameoka, Masanori; Deng, Lin; Terada, Yutaka; Kamitani, Wataru; Sato, Kei; Koyanagi, Yoshio; Hijikata, Makoto; Shindo, Keiko; Noda, Takeshi; Kohara, Michinori; Hotta, Hak",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29162867/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-16130-w,245

The first clinical trials have been testing repurposed drugs that show promising anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 effects in cultured cells. Although more than 2400 clinical trials are already under way, the actual number of tested compounds is still limited to approximately 20, alone or in combination. In addition, knowledge on their mode of action (MoA) is currently insufficient. Their first results reveal some inconsistencies and contradictory results and suggest that cohort size and quality of the control arm are two key issues for obtaining rigorous and conclusive results. Moreover, the observed discrepancies might also result from differences in the clinical inclusion criteria, including the possibility of early treatment that may be essential for therapy efficacy in patients with Covid‐19. Importantly, efforts should also be made to test new compounds with a documented MoA against SARS‐CoV‐2 in clinical trials. Successful treatment will probably be based on multitherapies with antiviral compounds that target different steps of the virus life cycle. Moreover, a multidisciplinary approach that combines artificial intelligence, compound docking, and robust in vitro and in vivo assays will accelerate the development of new antiviral molecules. Finally, large retrospective studies on hospitalized patients are needed to evaluate the different treatments with robust statistical tools and to identify the best treatment for each Covid‐19 stage.

One of the major reasons attributed to this variation is genetic mutation. Therefore, we aimed to predict the mutations in the spike protein (S) of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes available worldwide and analyze its impact on the antigenicity. Materials and Methods Several research groups have generated whole genome sequencing data which are available in the public repositories. A total of 1,604 spike proteins were extracted from 1,325 complete genome and 279 partial spike coding sequences of SARS-CoV-2 available in NCBI till May 1, 2020 and subjected to multiple sequence alignment to find the mutations corresponding to the reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genomic study. Further, the antigenicity of the predicted mutations inferred, and the epitopes were superimposed on the structure of the spike protein. Results The sequence analysis resulted in high SNPs frequency. The significant variations in the predicted epitopes showing high antigenicity were A348V, V367F and A419S in receptor binding domain (RBD). Other mutations observed within RBD exhibiting low antigenicity were T323I, A344S, R408I, G476S, V483A, H519Q, A520S, A522S and K529E. The RBD T323I, A344S, V367F, A419S, A522S and K529E are novel mutations reported first time in this study. Moreover, A930V and D936Y mutations were observed in the heptad repeat domain and one mutation D1168H was noted in heptad repeat domain 2. Conclusion S protein is the major target for vaccine development, but several mutations were predicted in the antigenic epitopes of S protein across all genomes available globally. The emergence of various mutations within a short period might result in the conformational changes of the protein structure, which suggests that developing a universal vaccine may be a challenging task.","Singh, Praveen Kumar; Kulsum, Umay; Rufai, Syed Beenish; Mudliar, S.

Rares études ont évalué la réponse anticorpale anti-SARS-CoV-2 dans cette population, qui a une diminution attendue des réponses immunitaires humorales et cellulaires due à l’immunosénescence. Matériels et méthodes Nous décrivons les caractéristiques cliniques et sérologiques de patients âgés hospitalisés dans cinq unités de soins de longue durée d’un CHU, touchés par deux grandes flambées épidémiques de COVID-19, en mars et novembre 2020. Dans un contexte d’urgence hospitalière, des tests sérologiques ont été réalisés pour le dépistage, le diagnostic et la réorganisation des services. Quatre-vingt-onze patients infectés en mars-avril ont été inclus rétrospectivement et suivis, cliniquement et par sérologies, pendant 12 mois. La réponse anticorpale a été évaluée 3, 6, 9 et 12 mois après l’infection, en utilisant le test Roche Elecsys pour détecter les anticorps anti-Spike et le test GenScript cPass comme test de neutralisation du virus. Résultats L’âge moyen des 91 patients était 86±7 ans, 68 % étaient des femmes. Les comorbidités les plus fréquentes étaient le diabète (23 %), l’hypertension artérielle (67 %), la coronaropathie (13%) ou le cancer (3%). La médiane d’indice de Charlson était 7 [6–8]. Tous les patients étaient fortement dépendants avec des ADL<2. L’infection à SARS-CoV-2 était diagnostiquée par une RT-qPCR nasopharyngée chez 75 d’eux ou par une sérologie positive. 85 % d’eux étaient symtpomatiques et 25 % nécessitaient d’une oxygénothérapie. À trois, 6 et 9 mois le titre moyen d’anti-Spike était respectivement de 207±84, 189±90, 181±93U/mL et la moyenne du pourcentage d’inhibition de la cPass était respectivement de 86±15, 77±20, 71±24 %. Les résultats sérologiques à 12 mois sont en cours d’analyse. Le titre d’anti-Spike et le pourcentage d’inhibition étaient fortement corrélés (r =0,85, p <0,0001). À 9 mois, tous les patients avaient des anti-Spike détectables, mais seulement 5 patients (5 %) avaient des titres inférieurs au seuil d’inhibition de 30% du test cPass. Aucun n’a développé de réinfection après la réexposition au SARS-CoV2 lors de la deuxième flambée épidémique. Conclusion Cette étude montre que, chez les personnes âgées, les anticorps neutralisants, évalués avec le test de neutralisation cPass, persistent au moins 9 mois après l’infection et semblent protéger contre une réinfection. À la lumière de ces données et dans un contexte global de pénurie de vaccins, un suivi sérologique pourrait être proposé pour évaluer la protection des personnes âgées précédemment infectées et économiser des doses de vaccins.","Collarino, R.; Vauloup-Fellous, C.; Allemang-Trivalle, A.; Mouna, L.; Duron, E.; Neiss, M.; Trikha, Z.; Guichardon, M.; Roque, A.; Trivalle, C.",Infectious Diseases Now,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666991921001214; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666991921001214,245

The cloned HP gene was placed in a plasmid under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and in vitro translation of transcripts generated in vitro yielded a 9.1-kDa protein that was immunoprecipitable with porcine hyperimmune anti-TGEV serum. Antiserum raised in rabbits against a 31 amino acid synthetic polypeptide that represented the central hydrophilic region of HP specifically immunoprecipitated HP from TGEV-infected cells. HP was further shown to become associated with microsomal membranes during synthesis in vitro and was found to be closely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and cell surface membranes in infected cells. The intracellular location of HP suggests that it may play a role in the membrane association of replication complexes or in virion assembly.","Tung, Frank Y.T.; Abraham, Sushma; Sethna, Manjiri; Hung, Shan-Ling; Sethna, Phiroze; Hogue, Brenda G.; Brian, David A.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1310191/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229290034M; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229290034M,245
