243,243,243,Inhibition of Lassa Virus Glycoprotein Cleavage and Multicycle Replication by Site 1 Protease-Adapted α(1)-Antitrypsin Variants,8.345352,8.164722,2009-06-02,"BACKGROUND: Proteolytic processing of the Lassa virus envelope glycoprotein precursor GP-C by the host proprotein convertase site 1 protease (S1P) is a prerequisite for the incorporation of the subunits GP-1 and GP-2 into viral particles and, hence, essential for infectivity and virus spread. Therefore, we tested in this study the concept of using S1P as a target to block efficient virus replication. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: We demonstrate that stable cell lines inducibly expressing S1P-adapted α(1)-antitrypsin variants inhibit the proteolytic maturation of GP-C. Introduction of the S1P recognition motifs RRIL and RRLL into the reactive center loop of α(1)-antitrypsin resulted in abrogation of GP-C processing by endogenous S1P to a similar level observed in S1P-deficient cells. Moreover, S1P-specific α(1)-antitrypsins significantly inhibited replication and spread of a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the Lassa virus glycoprotein GP as well as authentic Lassa virus. Inhibition of viral replication correlated with the ability of the different α(1)-antitrypsin variants to inhibit the processing of the Lassa virus glycoprotein precursor. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest that glycoprotein cleavage by S1P is a promising target for the development of novel anti-arenaviral strategies.","Maisa, Anna; Ströher, Ute; Klenk, Hans-Dieter; Garten, Wolfgang; Strecker, Thomas",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,119,28
290,290,290,Emerging Technologies for the Detection of Rabies Virus: Challenges and Hopes in the 21st Century,8.005919,8.212657,2009-09-29,"The diagnosis of rabies is routinely based on clinical and epidemiological information, especially when exposures are reported in rabies-endemic countries. Diagnostic tests using conventional assays that appear to be negative, even when undertaken late in the disease and despite the clinical diagnosis, have a tendency, at times, to be unreliable. These tests are rarely optimal and entirely dependent on the nature and quality of the sample supplied. In the course of the past three decades, the application of molecular biology has aided in the development of tests that result in a more rapid detection of rabies virus. These tests enable viral strain identification from clinical specimens. Currently, there are a number of molecular tests that can be used to complement conventional tests in rabies diagnosis. Indeed the challenges in the 21st century for the development of rabies diagnostics are not of a technical nature; these tests are available now. The challenges in the 21st century for diagnostic test developers are two-fold: firstly, to achieve internationally accepted validation of a test that will then lead to its acceptance by organisations globally. Secondly, the areas of the world where such tests are needed are mainly in developing regions where financial and logistical barriers prevent their implementation. Although developing countries with a poor healthcare infrastructure recognise that molecular-based diagnostic assays will be unaffordable for routine use, the cost/benefit ratio should still be measured. Adoption of rapid and affordable rabies diagnostic tests for use in developing countries highlights the importance of sharing and transferring technology through laboratory twinning between the developed and the developing countries. Importantly for developing countries, the benefit of molecular methods as tools is the capability for a differential diagnosis of human diseases that present with similar clinical symptoms. Antemortem testing for human rabies is now possible using molecular techniques. These barriers are not insurmountable and it is our expectation that if such tests are accepted and implemented where they are most needed, they will provide substantial improvements for rabies diagnosis and surveillance. The advent of molecular biology and new technological initiatives that combine advances in biology with other disciplines will support the development of techniques capable of high throughput testing with a low turnaround time for rabies diagnosis.","Fooks, Anthony R.; Johnson, Nicholas; Freuling, Conrad M.; Wakeley, Philip R.; Banyard, Ashley C.; McElhinney, Lorraine M.; Marston, Denise A.; Dastjerdi, Akbar; Wright, Edward; Weiss, Robin A.; Müller, Thomas",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,119,28
461,461,461,Antiviral and Neuroprotective Role of Octaguanidinium Dendrimer-Conjugated Morpholino Oligomers in Japanese Encephalitis,8.377473,8.095472,2010-11-23,"BACKGROUND: Japanese encephalitis (JE), caused by a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is endemic to the entire south-east Asian and adjoining regions. Currently no therapeutic interventions are available for JE, thereby making it one of the most dreaded encephalitides in the world. An effective way to counter the virus would be to inhibit viral replication by using anti-sense molecules directed against the viral genome. Octaguanidinium dendrimer-conjugated Morpholino (or Vivo-Morpholino) are uncharged anti-sense oligomers that can enter cells of living organisms by endocytosis and subsequently escape from endosomes into the cytosol/nuclear compartment of cells. We hypothesize that Vivo-Morpholinos generated against specific regions of 3′ or 5′ untranslated regions of JEV genome, when administered in an experimental model of JE, will have significant antiviral and neuroprotective effect. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mice were infected with JEV (GP78 strain) followed by intraperitoneal administration of Morpholinos (5 mg/kg body weight) daily for up to five treatments. Survivability of the animals was monitored for 15 days (or until death) following which they were sacrificed and their brains were processed either for immunohistochemical staining or protein extraction. Plaque assay and immunoblot analysis performed from brain homogenates showed reduced viral load and viral protein expression, resulting in greater survival of infected animals. Neuroprotective effect was observed by thionin staining of brain sections. Cytokine bead array showed reduction in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in brain following Morpholino treatment, which were elevated after infection. This corresponded to reduced microglial activation in brain. Oxidative stress was reduced and certain stress-related signaling molecules were found to be positively modulated following Morpholino treatment. In vitro studies also showed that there was decrease in infective viral particle production following Morpholino treatment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Administration of Vivo-Morpholino effectively resulted in increased survival of animals and neuroprotection in a murine model of JE. Hence, these oligomers represent a potential antiviral agent that merits further evaluation.","Nazmi, Arshed; Dutta, Kallol; Basu, Anirban",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,119,1

652,652,652,Ebola Virion Attachment and Entry into Human Macrophages Profoundly Effects Early Cellular Gene Expression,8.042511,8.2783985,2011-10-18,"Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) infections are associated with high lethality in primates. ZEBOV primarily targets mononuclear phagocytes, which are activated upon infection and secrete mediators believed to trigger initial stages of pathogenesis. The characterization of the responses of target cells to ZEBOV infection may therefore not only further understanding of pathogenesis but also suggest possible points of therapeutic intervention. Gene expression profiles of primary human macrophages exposed to ZEBOV were determined using DNA microarrays and quantitative PCR to gain insight into the cellular response immediately after cell entry. Significant changes in mRNA concentrations encoding for 88 cellular proteins were observed. Most of these proteins have not yet been implicated in ZEBOV infection. Some, however, are inflammatory mediators known to be elevated during the acute phase of disease in the blood of ZEBOV-infected humans. Interestingly, the cellular response occurred within the first hour of Ebola virion exposure, i.e. prior to virus gene expression. This observation supports the hypothesis that virion binding or entry mediated by the spike glycoprotein (GP(1,2)) is the primary stimulus for an initial response. Indeed, ZEBOV virions, LPS, and virus-like particles consisting of only the ZEBOV matrix protein VP40 and GP(1,2) (VLP(VP40-GP)) triggered comparable responses in macrophages, including pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic signals. In contrast, VLP(VP40) (particles lacking GP(1,2)) caused an aberrant response. This suggests that GP(1,2) binding to macrophages plays an important role in the immediate cellular response.","Wahl-Jensen, Victoria; Kurz, Sabine; Feldmann, Friedericke; Buehler, Lukas K.; Kindrachuk, Jason; DeFilippis, Victor; da Silva Correia, Jean; Früh, Klaus; Kuhn, Jens H.; Burton, Dennis R.; Feldmann, Heinz",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,119,11
751,751,751,Virus Identification in Unknown Tropical Febrile Illness Cases Using Deep Sequencing,8.1634865,8.316241,2012-02-07,"Dengue virus is an emerging infectious agent that infects an estimated 50–100 million people annually worldwide, yet current diagnostic practices cannot detect an etiologic pathogen in ∼40% of dengue-like illnesses. Metagenomic approaches to pathogen detection, such as viral microarrays and deep sequencing, are promising tools to address emerging and non-diagnosable disease challenges. In this study, we used the Virochip microarray and deep sequencing to characterize the spectrum of viruses present in human sera from 123 Nicaraguan patients presenting with dengue-like symptoms but testing negative for dengue virus. We utilized a barcoding strategy to simultaneously deep sequence multiple serum specimens, generating on average over 1 million reads per sample. We then implemented a stepwise bioinformatic filtering pipeline to remove the majority of human and low-quality sequences to improve the speed and accuracy of subsequent unbiased database searches. By deep sequencing, we were able to detect virus sequence in 37% (45/123) of previously negative cases. These included 13 cases with Human Herpesvirus 6 sequences. Other samples contained sequences with similarity to sequences from viruses in the Herpesviridae, Flaviviridae, Circoviridae, Anelloviridae, Asfarviridae, and Parvoviridae families. In some cases, the putative viral sequences were virtually identical to known viruses, and in others they diverged, suggesting that they may derive from novel viruses. These results demonstrate the utility of unbiased metagenomic approaches in the detection of known and divergent viruses in the study of tropical febrile illness.","Yozwiak, Nathan L.; Skewes-Cox, Peter; Stenglein, Mark D.; Balmaseda, Angel; Harris, Eva; DeRisi, Joseph L.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,119,28

Although the first isolates were from Nigeria and other Congo basin countries, all reports over the past 20 years have been from southern Africa. Previous phylogenetic studies analyzed few isolates or used partial gene sequence for analysis since limited sequence information is available for MOKV and the isolates were distributed among various laboratories. The complete nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrix and glycoprotein genes of 18 MOKV isolates in various laboratories were sequenced either using partial or full genome sequencing using pyrosequencing and a phylogenetic analysis was undertaken. The results indicated that MOKV isolates from the Republic of South Africa, Zimbabwe, Central African Republic and Nigeria clustered according to geographic origin irrespective of the genes used for phylogenetic analysis, similar to that observed with Lagos bat virus. A Bayesian Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo- (MCMC) analysis revealed the age of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of MOKV to be between 279 and 2034 years depending on the genes used. Generally, all MOKV isolates showed a similar pattern at the amino acid sites considered influential for viral properties.","Kgaladi, Joe; Wright, Nicolette; Coertse, Jessica; Markotter, Wanda; Marston, Denise; Fooks, Anthony R.; Freuling, Conrad M.; Müller, Thomas F.; Sabeta, Claude T.; Nel, Louis H.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,119,28
1683,1683,1683,Using Modelling to Disentangle the Relative Contributions of Zoonotic and Anthroponotic Transmission: The Case of Lassa Fever,7.863675,7.9817333,2015-01-08,"BACKGROUND: Zoonotic infections, which transmit from animals to humans, form the majority of new human pathogens. Following zoonotic transmission, the pathogen may already have, or may acquire, the ability to transmit from human to human. With infections such as Lassa fever (LF), an often fatal, rodent-borne, hemorrhagic fever common in areas of West Africa, rodent-to-rodent, rodent-to-human, human-to-human and even human-to-rodent transmission patterns are possible. Indeed, large hospital-related outbreaks have been reported. Estimating the proportion of transmission due to human-to-human routes and related patterns (e.g. existence of super-spreaders), in these scenarios is challenging, but essential for planned interventions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we make use of an innovative modeling approach to analyze data from published outbreaks and the number of LF hospitalized patients to Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone to estimate the likely contribution of human-to-human transmission. The analyses show that almost [Image: see text] of the cases at KGH are secondary cases arising from human-to-human transmission. However, we found much of this transmission is associated with a disproportionally large impact of a few individuals (‘super-spreaders’), as we found only [Image: see text] of human cases result in an effective reproduction number (i.e. the average number of secondary cases per infectious case) [Image: see text], with a maximum value up to [Image: see text]. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This work explains the discrepancy between the sizes of reported LF outbreaks and a clinical perception that human-to-human transmission is low. Future assessment of risks of LF and infection control guidelines should take into account the potentially large impact of super-spreaders in human-to-human transmission. Our work highlights several neglected topics in LF research, the occurrence and nature of super-spreading events and aspects of social behavior in transmission and detection.","Lo Iacono, Giovanni; Cunningham, Andrew A.; Fichet-Calvet, Elisabeth; Garry, Robert F.; Grant, Donald S.; Khan, Sheik Humarr; Leach, Melissa; Moses, Lina M.; Schieffelin, John S.; Shaffer, Jeffrey G.; Webb, Colleen T.; Wood, James L.

However, 10–20% affected individuals develop persistent arthralgia which contributes to considerable morbidity. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying these manifestations are not well understood. The present study investigated the possible occurrence of molecular mimicry between CHIKV E1 glycoprotein and host human components. METHODOLOGY: Bioinformatic tools were used to identify peptides of CHIKV E1 exhibiting similarity to host components. Two peptides (A&B) were identified using several bioinformatic tools, synthesised and used to validate the results obtained in silico. An ELISA was designed to assess the immunoreactivity of serum samples from CHIKV patients to these peptides. Further, experiments were conducted in a C57BL/6J experimental mouse model to investigate if peptide A and peptide B were indeed capable of inducing pathology. FINDINGS: The serum samples showed reactivity of varying degrees, indicating that these peptides are indeed being recognized by the host immune system during CHIKV infection. Further, these peptides when injected into C57BL/6J mice were able to induce significant inflammation in the muscles of C57BL/6J mice, similar to that observed in animals that were injected with CHIKV alone. Additionally, animals that were primed initially with CHIKV followed by a subsequent injection of the CHIKV peptides exhibited enhanced inflammatory pathology in the skeletal muscles as compared to animals that were injected with peptides or virus alone. Collectively these observations validate the hypothesis that molecular mimicry between CHIKV E1 protein and host proteins does contribute to pathology in CHIKV infection.","Reddy, Vijayalakshmi; Desai, Anita; Krishna, Shankar Susarla; Vasanthapuram, Ravi",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,119,28
2604,2604,2604,Mosquito cell-derived West Nile virus replicon particles mimic arbovirus inoculum and have reduced spread in mice,8.219097,8.160839,2017-02-10,"Half of the human population is at risk of infection by an arthropod-borne virus. Many of these arboviruses, such as West Nile, dengue, and Zika viruses, infect humans by way of a bite from an infected mosquito. This infectious inoculum is insect cell-derived giving the virus particles distinct qualities not present in secondary infectious virus particles produced by infected vertebrate host cells. The insect cell-derived particles differ in the glycosylation of virus structural proteins and the lipid content of the envelope, as well as their induction of cytokines. Thus, in order to accurately mimic the inoculum delivered by arthropods, arboviruses should be derived from arthropod cells. Previous studies have packaged replicon genome in mammalian cells to produce replicon particles, which undergo only one round of infection, but no studies exist packaging replicon particles in mosquito cells. Here we optimized the packaging of West Nile virus replicon genome in mosquito cells and produced replicon particles at high concentration, allowing us to mimic mosquito cell-derived viral inoculum. These particles were mature with similar genome equivalents-to-infectious units as full-length West Nile virus. We then compared the mosquito cell-derived particles to mammalian cell-derived particles in mice. Both replicon particles infected skin at the inoculation site and the draining lymph node by 3 hours post-inoculation. The mammalian cell-derived replicon particles spread from the site of inoculation to the spleen and contralateral lymph nodes significantly more than the particles derived from mosquito cells. This in vivo difference in spread of West Nile replicons in the inoculum demonstrates the importance of using arthropod cell-derived particles to model early events in arboviral infection and highlights the value of these novel arthropod cell-derived replicon particles for studying the earliest virus-host interactions for arboviruses.","Boylan, Brendan T.; Moreira, Fernando R.; Carlson, Tim W.; Bernard, Kristen A.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,119,28
3226,3226,3226,Improving early epidemiological assessment of emerging Aedes-transmitted epidemics using historical data,7.884443,7.9459577,2018-06-04,"Model-based epidemiological assessment is useful to support decision-making at the beginning of an emerging Aedes-transmitted outbreak. However, early forecasts are generally unreliable as little information is available in the first few incidence data points. Here, we show how past Aedes-transmitted epidemics help improve these predictions. The approach was applied to the 2015–2017 Zika virus epidemics in three islands of the French West Indies, with historical data including other Aedes-transmitted diseases (chikungunya and Zika) in the same and other locations. Hierarchical models were used to build informative a priori distributions on the reproduction ratio and the reporting rates. The accuracy and sharpness of forecasts improved substantially when these a priori distributions were used in models for prediction. For example, early forecasts of final epidemic size obtained without historical information were 3.3 times too high on average (range: 0.2 to 5.8) with respect to the eventual size, but were far closer (1.1 times the real value on average, range: 0.4 to 1.5) using information on past CHIKV epidemics in the same places. Likewise, the 97.5% upper bound for maximal incidence was 15.3 times (range: 2.0 to 63.1) the actual peak incidence, and became much sharper at 2.4 times (range: 1.3 to 3.9) the actual peak incidence with informative a priori distributions. Improvements were more limited for the date of peak incidence and the total duration of the epidemic. The framework can adapt to all forecasting models at the early stages of emerging Aedes-transmitted outbreaks.","Riou, Julien; Poletto, Chiara; Boëlle, Pierre-Yves",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,119,1

3572,3572,3572,Robustness of the reproductive number estimates in vector-borne disease systems,7.9477553,8.162573,2018-12-17,"BACKGROUND: The required efforts, feasibility and predicted success of an intervention strategy against an infectious disease are partially determined by its basic reproduction number, R(0). In its simplest form R(0) can be understood as the product of the infectious period, the number of infectious contacts and the per-contact transmission probability, which in the case of vector-transmitted diseases necessarily extend to the vector stages. As vectors do not usually recover from infection, they remain infectious for life, which places high significance on the vector’s life expectancy. Current methods for estimating the R(0) for a vector-borne disease are mostly derived from compartmental modelling frameworks assuming constant vector mortality rates. We hypothesised that some of the assumptions underlying these models can lead to unrealistic high vector life expectancies with important repercussions for R(0) estimates. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we used a stochastic, individual-based model which allowed us to directly measure the number of secondary infections arising from one index case under different assumptions about vector mortality. Our results confirm that formulas based on age-independent mortality rates can overestimate R(0) by nearly 100% compared to our own estimate derived from first principles. We further provide a correction factor that can be used with a standard R(0) formula and adjusts for the discrepancies due to erroneous vector age distributions. CONCLUSION: Vector mortality rates play a crucial role for the success and general epidemiology of vector-transmitted diseases. Many modelling efforts intrinsically assume these to be age-independent, which, as clearly demonstrated here, can lead to severe over-estimation of the disease’s reproduction number. Our results thus re-emphasise the importance of obtaining field-relevant and species-dependent vector mortality rates, which in turn would facilitate more realistic intervention impact predictions.","Tennant, Warren; Recker, Mario",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,119,17

TIM-1 expression has been implicated in Ebola virus (EBOV) pathogenesis; however, it remains unclear whether this is due to TIM-1 serving as a filovirus receptor in vivo or, as others have suggested, TIM-1 induces a cytokine storm elicited by T cell/virion interactions. Here, we use a BSL2 model virus that expresses EBOV glycoprotein to demonstrate the importance of TIM-1 as a virus receptor late during in vivo infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Infectious, GFP-expressing recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus encoding either full length EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV GP/rVSV) or mucin domain deleted EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV GPΔO/rVSV) was used to assess the role of TIM-1 during in vivo infection. GFP-expressing rVSV encoding its native glycoprotein G (G/rVSV) served as a control. TIM-1-sufficient or TIM-1-deficient BALB/c interferon α/β receptor(-/-) mice were challenged with these viruses. While G/rVSV caused profound morbidity and mortality in both mouse strains, TIM-1-deficient mice had significantly better survival than TIM-1-expressing mice following EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV GPΔO/rVSV challenge. EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV GPΔO/rVSV in spleen of infected animals was high and unaffected by expression of TIM-1. However, infectious virus in serum, liver, kidney and adrenal gland was reduced late in infection in the TIM-1-deficient mice, suggesting that virus entry via this receptor contributes to virus load. Consistent with higher virus loads, proinflammatory chemokines trended higher in organs from infected TIM-1-sufficient mice compared to the TIM-1-deficient mice, but proinflammatory cytokines were more modestly affected. To assess the role of T cells in EBOV GP/rVSV pathogenesis, T cells were depleted in TIM-1-sufficient and -deficient mice and the mice were challenged with virus. Depletion of T cells did not alter the pathogenic consequences of virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies provide evidence that at late times during EBOV GP/rVSV infection, TIM-1 increased virus load and associated mortality, consistent with an important role of this receptor in virus entry. This work suggests that inhibitors which block TIM-1/virus interaction may serve as effective antivirals, reducing virus load at late times during EBOV infection.","Brunton, Bethany; Rogers, Kai; Phillips, Elisabeth K.; Brouillette, Rachel B.; Bouls, Ruayda; Butler, Noah S.; Maury, Wendy",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,119,28

Intestinal infection with Y. pseudotuberculosis, particularly of serotype III, was found to be especially prevalent in weaned calves, yearlings and young adult cattle. Clinically affected cattle had a profuse liquid diarrhoea and many were systemically ill. Haematological changes suggestive of infection were present in 38 of 49 of these cattle. At least 35 cattle died and characteristic microabscesses were demonstrated in the intestinal mucosa of 20 of 26 examined histologically. Y. pseudotuberculosis was sensitive to tetracyclines in vitro and this drug produced a rapid bacteriological cure. Yersiniosis occurred during the winter, spring and early summer. Challenge of adult cattle with Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype III did not result in intestinal colonisation or clinical disease. Intestinal infection was, however, established in 4 weaned calves and haematological changes and antibody production were demonstrated in them. Intestinal microabscesses were seen in three calves killed on days 8, 14 and 18 after challenge. The fourth calf eliminated infection by day 18 and no lesions were demonstrated when it was killed on day 72. There is a very high prevalence of antibodies reacting with Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype III in adult cattle. It is concluded that cattle are a common host for this bacterium, infection being frequent, with clinical and fatal disease occurring occasionally. The factors leading to clinical disease are unknown.","SLEE, KJ; BRIGHTLING, P; SEILER, RJ",Aust Vet J,119,1

It is often being used in combination with other substances, such as cannabis. CASE SUMMARY: A young adult attended the emergency room because of chest pain after recreational use of very high-dose nitrous oxide in combination with cannabis. Electrocardiography demonstrated ST-elevation in the anterior leads. Coronary angiography showed thrombus in the proximal and thrombotic occlusion of the distal left anterior descending coronary artery for which primary percutaneous coronary intervention was attempted. Thrombus aspiration was unsuccessful and the patient was further treated with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in addition to dual platelet therapy. Blood results showed low vitamin B12 and folic acid status with concomitant hyperhomocysteinaemia, a known cause of hypercoagulation. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Three months later, an improvement in LVEF and no recurrent angina or symptoms of heart failure were noticed. DISCUSSION: We report a case of acute myocardial infarction secondary to very high-dose nitrous oxide abuse in combination with cannabis and possible hypoxia. We propose that severe hyperhomocysteinaemia secondary to nitrous oxide-induced vitamin B12 deficiency together with the vasoconstrictive effects of cannabis might pose a seriously increased risk for intracoronary, among others, thrombus formation. In conclusion, we contest the safety and innocence of recreational nitrous oxide (ab)use, notably in the context of other factors increasing the risk of coagulation.","Oomens, Thomas; Riezebos, Robert K; Amoroso, Giovanni; Kuipers, Remko S",Eur Heart J Case Rep,119,11

Although there are many V-ATPase structures reported, the molecular basis of specific inhibitors on V-ATPase remains unknown. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of bafilomycin A1 bound intact bovine V-ATPase at an overall resolution of 3.6-Å. The structure reveals six bafilomycin A1 molecules bound to the c-ring. One bafilomycin A1 molecule engages with two c subunits and disrupts the interactions between the c-ring and subunit a, thereby preventing proton translocation. Structural and sequence analyses demonstrate that the bafilomycin A1-binding residues are conserved in yeast and mammalian species and the 7’-hydroxyl group of bafilomycin A1 acts as a unique feature recognized by subunit c.","Wang, Rong; Wang, Jin; Hassan, Abdirahman; Lee, Chia-Hsueh; Xie, Xiao-Song; Li, Xiaochun",Nat Commun,119,28

As revealed by their wide host range (more than 420 plant species), worldwide distribution, and effective vector transmission, begomoviruses are highly adaptive. Still, the genetic factors that facilitate their adaptation to a diverse array of hosts and vectors remain poorly understood. Mutations in the virus genome may confer a selective advantage for essential functions, such as transmission, replication, evading host responses, and movement within the host. Therefore, genetic variation is vital to virus evolution and, in response to selection pressure, is demonstrated as the emergence of new strains and species adapted to diverse hosts or with unique pathogenicity. The combination of variation and selection forms a genetic imprint on the genome. This review focuses on factors that contribute to the evolution of Begomovirus and their global spread, for which an unforeseen diversity and dispersal has been recognized and continues to expand.","Nigam, Deepti",Plants (Basel),119,11

The aims of this study were (1) to assess ecotoxicity effects over time to soil fauna, posed by Lorsban® 480 BR (Chlorpyrifos) and Dithane® NT (Mancozeb) residues when disposed of in a biobed system compared with two subtropical soils, and (2) to assess ecotoxicity effects over time to soil fauna simulating an accidental spillage with Lorsban® 480 BR at the biobed. A semi-field experiment was conducted for 420 days in southern Brazil, testing continuous disposal of washing pulverization tanks in biobeds, Typic Haploperox or Typic Hapludults. In addition, different biobeds received a single dose (1 L) of Lorsban® 480 BR to simulate an accidental spillage. Chronic ecotoxicity tests were performed using Folsomia candida, Eisenia andrei, and Enchytraeus crypticus in different sampling times for both experiments. F. candida was the most sensitive species. The biobed system was able to eliminate effects from residues of both pesticides over time in all species, which did not happen in both natural soils. In accidental spillage simulation, even 420 days after contamination, F. candida did not show reproduction. The biobeds can be a feasible alternative for the disposal and treatment residues of pesticides, also for handling and washing pesticides activities. The system was efficient in promoting degradation and reducing ecotoxicity effects posed by Lorsban® 480 BR and Dithane® NT for soil fauna. It is a safe alternative to avoid soil contamination.","Carniel, Letícia Scopel Camargo; Niemeyer, Julia Carina; de Oliveira Filho, Luís Carlos Iuñes; Alexandre, Douglas; Gebler, Luciano; Klauberg-Filho, Osmar",Ecotoxicology,119,26

The most feared complication after LSG is staple line leak. METHODS Eight bariatric centers in Israel participated in this study. A retrospective analysis was performed by querying all the LSG cases performed between June 2006 and June 2010. The data collected included patient demographics, anthropometrics, and operative and perioperative parameters. RESULTS Among the 2,834 patients who underwent LSG, 44 (1.5%) with gastric leaks were identified. Of these 44 patients, 30 (68%) were women. The patients had a mean age of 41.5 years and a body mass index (BMI) of 45.4 kg/m(2). Intraoperative leak tests and routine postoperative swallow studies were performed with 33 patients, and all but one patient (3%) failed to detect the leaks. Leaks were diagnosed at a median of 7 days postoperatively: early (0-2 days) in nine cases (20%), intermediately (3-14 days) in 32 cases (73%), and late (>14 days) in three cases (7%). For 38 patients (86%), there was clinical suspicion, later confirmed by imaging or operative findings. Computed tomography, swallow studies, and methylene blue tests were performed for 37, 21, and 15 patients, respectively, and the results were positive, respectively, for 31 (84%), 11 (50%), and 9 (60%) of these patients. Reoperation was performed for 27 of the patients (61%). Other treatment methods included percutaneous drainage (n = 28, 63.6%), endoscopic placement of stents (n = 11, 25%), clips (n = 1, 2.3%), and fibrin glue (n = 1, 2.3%). In 33 of the patients (75%), the leak site was found in the upper sleeve near the gastroesophageal junction. The median time to leak closure was 40 days (range, 2-270 days), and the overall leak-related mortality rate was 0.14% (4/2,834). CONCLUSION Gastric leak is the most common cause of major morbidity and mortality after LSG. Routine tests to rule out leaks seem to be superfluous. Rather, selective utilization is recommended. Management options vary, depending mainly on patient disposition. An accepted algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of gastric leak has yet to be proposed.","Sakran, Nasser; Goitein, David; Raziel, Asnat; Keidar, Andrei; Beglaibter, Nahum; Grinbaum, Ronit; Matter, Ibrahim; Alfici, Ricardo; Mahajna, Ahmad; Waksman, Igor; Shimonov, Mordechai; Assalia, Ahmad",Surgical endoscopy,119,1

Further, little research is done on how affect moderates the sleep-pain relationship after sleep fragmentation. The present study sought to clarify the relationship between pain, sleep and positive and negative affect. Methods: In an experimental counterbalanced crossover design, 35 healthy young adults were subjected to several pain measures after one night of fragmented sleep, compared to one control night of normal sleep, both conducted in their own homes, and respectively, positive and negative affect induction using validated film clips and facial feedback procedures. Sleep was monitored using sleep diaries. Results: Increased pain sensitivity after one night of experimentally induced sleep fragmentation was found, compared to after one control night of undisturbed sleep. No main effects of induced affect on pain were found, and sleep x induced affect interaction was not significant. Conclusion: The present study supports the adverse effect of sleep fragmentation on pain sensitivity, however, affect was not found to be a moderator in the sleep-pain relationship. The results underline the need for further research within this field.","Rosseland, Ragna; Pallesen, Ståle; Nordhus, Inger Hilde; Matre, Dagfinn; Blågestad, Tone",Frontiers in psychology,119,24

Mental depression is a common disorder that affects most individuals at one time or another. During depression, there are changes in mood and behavior, accompanied by feelings of defeat, hopelessness, or even suicidal thoughts. Depression has a direct or indirect relation with a number of other diseases including Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. In addition, antidepressant drugs have several side effects including sedation, increased weight, indigestion, sexual dysfunction, or a decrease in blood pressure. Stopping medication may cause a relapse of the symptoms of depression and pose a risk of attempted suicide. The pandemic of COVID-19 has affected the mental health of individuals, including patients, individuals contacting patients and medical staff with a number of mental disorders that may adversely affect the immune ability of their bodies. Some of the drugs currently included in the protocols for treating COVID-19 may negatively affect the mental health of patients. Evidence accumulated over the years indicates that serotonin (5HT) deficiencies and norepinephrine (NE) in the brain can lead to mental depression. Drugs that increase levels of NE and 5HT are commonly used in the treatment of depression. The common reason for mood disorders, including mania and bipolar disease are not clearly understood. It is assumed that hyperactivity in specific parts of the brain and excessive activity of neurotransmitters may be involved. Early diagnosis and developing new treatment strategies are essential for the prevention of the severe consequences of depression. In addition, extensive research should be directed towards the investigation of the mental health disturbances occurring during and/or after COVID-19 infection. This may lead to the incorporation of a suitable antidepressant into the current treatment protocols.","Abdel-Bakky, Mohamed S; Amin, Elham; Faris, Tarek M; Abdellatif, Ahmed A H",Molecular medicine reports,119,25

There are still limited data about distribution of acute viral respiratory infections in children with cancer. OBJECTIVE The first aim of this study was to evaluate the viral etiology and seasonality of acute viral respiratory infection in pediatric patients with cancer in a 3-year study. Our second aim was to evaluate the impact of viral infections on delaying the patients' chemotherapy or radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2014 to July 2017. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed in patients younger than 21 years with acute respiratory infections. Patients were treated in the Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Department of Dr. Behçet Uz Children's Hospital with real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Data were analyzed to determine the frequency and seasonality of infections. The χ or the Fisher exact tests were used. RESULTS A total of 219 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirates and blood were analyzed. The mean patient age was 76.8±59.3 months, with 46.3% female and 53.7% male children in a total of 108 patients. Of this total, 55% (60/108 cases) had multiple acute respiratory infections. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (48.1%) was the most prevalent disease. The 3 most prevalent viruses were human rhinovirus (HRV) (33.1%), parainfluenza (PI) (18.7%), and coronavirus (CoV) (14.8%). In terms of the seasonal distribution of viruses, PI was most common in winter 2014, HRV in spring 2014, HRV in fall 2014, PI in winter 2015 and summer 2015, CoV in spring 2015, HRV in fall 2015, both influenza and HRV in winter 2016, both human metapneumovirus and bocavirus in spring 2016, HRV in summer 2016, both HRV and PI in fall 2016, both respiratory syncytial virus and influenza in winter 2017, HRV in spring 2017, and both HRV and adenovirus in summer 2017. The mean duration of neutropenia for patients with viral respiratory infection was 17.1±13.8 (range: 2 to 90) days. The mean duration of symptoms of viral respiratory infection was 6.8±4.2 (range: 2 to 31) days. A delay in chemotherapy treatment owing to viral respiratory infection was detected in 73 (33.3%) patients. The mean duration of delay in chemotherapy treatment was 9.6±5.4 (range: 3 to 31) days.

A mixed model analysis of total applicant rating with crossed effects of applicants and interviewers was used. A total of 94 applicants were interviewed by 27 panel members, with between two and four panel members per interview, giving a total of 329 applicant ratings. The random effect of applicants accounted for 45.8% of total variance in ratings (95% confidence intervals (CI) for intraclass correlation (ICC) 35.8%-57.2%) while interviewer effects accounted for 13.4% of total variance (95% CI for ICC 5.3%-30.0%).

We hypothesized there are no differences in the force needed to dislodge mesh from tissue using barbed and nonbarbed sutures of similar size. METHODS Using the rectus fascia of three unembalmed cadavers, a 6 × 3 cm strip of polypropylene mesh was anchored to the fascia with sutures. The barbed sutures investigated were 2-0 V-Loc 180 (nine trials) and 3-0 bidirectional Quill™ SRS PDO (five trials). The nonbarbed sutures included 2-0 PDS (nine trials), CV-2 GORE-TEX (nine trials) and 2-0 Prolene (nine trials). The free-end of the mesh was anchored to a pulley system fixed to a tensiometer to measure the peak force applied at the moment of mesh dislodgement (termed the pull-out force). The pull-out force was recorded. Continuous variables are presented as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). Analysis of variance was used to compare the forces across the suture types. RESULTS The highest pull-out force observed was with GORE-TEX (median 65.14 N, IQR 53.37-68.77 N) followed by Prolene (median 58.98 N, IQR 54.64-62.59 N), V-Loc (median 55.23 N, IQR 51.60-58.57 N), PDS (53.96 N, IQR 51.60-57.88 N), and Quill (44.44 N, IQR 17.27-47.38 N). All 2-0 and CV-2 caliber sutures had greater pull-out forces than 3-0 Quill sutures (p < 0.01). No significant differences in pull-out forces were observed between 2-0 and CV-2 caliber sutures (p > 0.05). In 35 of the 41 trials (85%), the mesh sheared from the tissue. CONCLUSION CV-2 ad 2-0 barbed and nonbarbed sutures had similar pull-out forces in an assessment of mesh fixation strength.","Pilkinton, Marjorie L; Levine, Gregory C; Bennett, Laura; Winkler, Harvey A; Shalom, Dara F; Finamore, Peter S",International urogynecology journal,119,1

It formulates a professional educational relationship between a staff nurse (preceptor) and student nurse and is based on the provision of providing patient care. Preceptorship is widely acknowledged in the literature as a positive pedagogical approach in clinical nursing education in terms of knowledge and skill acquisition, confidence, and professional socialisation of undergraduate nursing students. However, the literature also widely reports negative interpersonal experiences within this professional educational relationship resulting in negative educational experiences and in some cases, negative patient experiences. Therefore, the authors set out to examine what teaching strategies are being implemented by nurse educators to encourage the development of interpersonal and communication skills in facilitating positive interpersonal relationships between the preceptor, nursing student and patient.

Secondary HLH is always caused by autoimmune disease, infections, or cancer. The first-line therapy for secondary HLH is the HLH 2004 protocol, including dexamethasone, etoposide, and supportive therapy. However, up to 30% of patients, especially pediatric patients, remain unresponsive to first-line treatment, and the mortality rate reaches 50% in children with HLH. Furthermore, some children who have special conditions, such as an active virus infection, are not suitable for immunosuppressants treatment. Recently, several HLH-promoting cytokines have been identified, including interferon-γ, interleukin-2, and interleukin-6. Janus kinase 1 and 2 control the signaling of many cytokines, notably interferon-γ, interleukin-2, and interleukin-6. Janus kinase 1 and 2 inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, have been successfully used to treat HLH in mice. Here, we report that a boy, diagnosed with HLH and high titer of hepatitis B virus-DNA copies, improved quickly, and the cytokine storm of HLH was alleviated after receiving ruxolitinib. Five days after ruxolitinib treatment, entecavir was introduced and serum titer results of hepatitis B virus-DNA returned negative. With 3 months of ruxolitinib treatment and following-up 1 year, the boy's situation maintained sustained remission. In this study, it is suggested that ruxolitinib might be a first-line drug, which could alleviate the cytokine storm of HLH. This treatment may be ushering in the age of glucocorticosteroid-free HLH treatment, which is particularly meaningful for children because it avoids the side effects of glucocorticosteroid.","Jianguo, Li; Zhixuan, Zhou; Rong, Liu; Xiaodong, Shi",Pediatrics,119,5

To date, only a few studies have investigated the differences between these two wound closure methods in TKA. Accordingly, this study aimed to compare cosmetic outcome and patient satisfaction between staples and subcuticular suture for post-TKA wound closure. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective randomized controlled trial included patients scheduled to undergo TKA at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery of Siriraj Hospital (Bangkok, Thailand) during June 2018-March 2019. Patients were randomized into the staples or subcuticular suture groups. Hollander Wound Evaluation Scale (HWES), cosmetic-visual analogue scale (VAS), and patient satisfaction-VAS were evaluated at the 6-week and 3-month follow-ups. Functional outcome by the modified Knee Society Knee Scoring System and wound complications were also assessed. RESULTS Sixty-two patients (31 per group) were included. There were no significant differences in the HWES, cosmetic-VAS, patient satisfaction-VAS, or wound complication rate between groups at the 6-week or 3-month follow-ups. Wound closure time was significantly shorter in the staples group (p < 0.001), but the total operative time was not significantly different between groups. Modified knee score was significantly better in the suture group at 6 weeks (p = 0.024), but there was no significant difference between groups at 3 months. Significant association was observed between patient satisfaction-VAS and cosmetic-VAS at the 6-week (p = 0.03) and 3-month (p = 0.021) follow-ups. CONCLUSION Subcuticular suture and staples were found to be comparable wound-closure options after TKA relative to cosmetic outcome, patient satisfaction, functional outcome, and wound complication rate at 3-months post-operation.","Nepal, Sarthak; Ruangsomboon, Pakpoom; Udomkiat, Pacharapol; Unnanuntana, Aasis",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,119,17

A total of 6888 articles were screened, 34 met the inclusion criteria. Maladaptive eating behaviours (MEB), preoperative weight loss (PWL), and tobacco use were reported 21, 18, and 3 times respectively. Physical activity and substance abuse were each reported once. Most articles on PWL (72.2%) and MEB (52.4%) reported no association. Positive associations were reported in 22.2% and 14.3% of articles for PWL and MEB respectively. Negative associations were reported in 5.6% and 33.3% of articles for PWL and MEB, respectively. Marked heterogeneity in outcome reporting hindered quantitative synthesis. The current paucity of evidence amenable to synthesis leads to ongoing uncertainty regarding the size and direction of association between PWL and MEB with outcomes following bariatric surgery.

One prominent phospholipid shuttling process concerns the biogenesis of APOB-containing lipoproteins within the ER lumen, which may require bulk trans-bilayer movement of phospholipids from the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER bilayer. Here, we show that TMEM41B, present in the lipoprotein export machinery, encodes a previously conceptualized ER lipid scramblase mediating trans-bilayer shuttling of bulk phospholipids. Loss of hepatic TMEM41B eliminates plasma lipids, due to complete absence of mature lipoproteins within the ER, but paradoxically also activates lipid production. Mechanistically, scramblase deficiency triggers unique ER morphological changes and unsuppressed activation of SREBPs, which potently promotes lipid synthesis despite stalled secretion. Together, this response induces full-blown nonalcoholic hepatosteatosis in the TMEM41B-deficient mice within weeks. Collectively, our data uncovered a fundamental mechanism safe-guarding ER function and integrity, dysfunction of which disrupts lipid homeostasis.","Huang, Dong; Xu, Bolin; Liu, Lu; Wu, Lingzhi; Zhu, Yuangang; Ghanbarpour, Alireza; Wang, Yawei; Chen, Feng-Jung; Lyu, Jia; Hu, Yating; Kang, Yunlu; Zhou, Wenjing; Wang, Xiao; Ding, Wanqiu; Li, Xin; Jiang, Zhaodi; Chen, Jizheng; Zhang, Xu; Zhou, Hongwen; Li, John Zhong; Guo, Chunguang; Zheng, Wen; Zhang, Xiuqin; Li, Peng; Melia, Thomas; Reinisch, Karin; Chen, Xiao-Wei",Cell metabolism,119,1

The active electrode and its cord emit radiofrequency energy that couples (or transfers) to nearby conductive material without direct contact. This phenomenon is increased when the active electrode cord is oriented parallel to another wire/cord. The parallel orientation of the ""Bovie"" and laparoscopic camera cords cause transfer of energy to the camera cord resulting in cutaneous burns at the camera trocar incision. We hypothesized that separating the active electrode/camera cords would reduce thermal injury occurring at the camera trocar incision in comparison to parallel oriented active electrode/camera cords. METHODS In this prospective, blinded, randomized controlled trial, patients undergoing standardized laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized to separated active electrode/camera cords or parallel oriented active electrode/camera cords. The primary outcome variable was thermal injury determined by histology from skin biopsied at the camera trocar incision. RESULTS Eighty-four patients participated. Baseline demographics were similar in the groups for age, sex, preoperative diagnosis, operative time, and blood loss. Thermal injury at the camera trocar incision was lower in the separated versus parallel group (31% vs 57%; P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS Separation of the laparoscopic camera cord from the active electrode cord decreases thermal injury from antenna coupling at the camera trocar incision in comparison to the parallel orientation of these cords. Therefore, parallel orientation of these cords (an arrangement promoted by integrated operating rooms) should be abandoned. The findings of this study should influence the operating room setup for all laparoscopic cases.","Robinson, Thomas N; Jones, Edward L; Dunn, Christina L; Dunne, Bruce; Johnson, Elizabeth; Townsend, Nicole T; Paniccia, Alessandro; Stiegmann, Greg V",Annals of surgery,119,1

BPA can contaminate food, beverage, air, and soil. It accumulates in several human tissues and organs and is potentially harmful to human health through different molecular mechanisms. Due to its hormone-like properties, BPA may bind to estrogen receptors, thereby affecting both body weight and tumorigenesis. BPA may also affect metabolism and cancer progression, by interacting with GPR30, and may impair male reproductive function, by binding to androgen receptors. Several transcription factors, including PPARγ, C/EBP, Nrf2, HOX, and HAND2, are involved in BPA action on fat and liver homeostasis, the cardiovascular system, and cancer. Finally, epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, histones modification, and changes in microRNAs expression contribute to BPA pathological effects. This review aims to provide an extensive and comprehensive analysis of the most recent evidence about the potential mechanisms by which BPA affects human health.","Cimmino, Ilaria; Fiory, Francesca; Perruolo, Giuseppe; Miele, Claudia; Beguinot, Francesco; Formisano, Pietro; Oriente, Francesco",International journal of molecular sciences,119,10

METHODS We conducted a literature search on the MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases in addition to Google Scholar and grey literature to identify studies in the period January 2008 to January 2020. All were English studies of registries and databases on female adults undergoing surgery for pelvic floor disorders including stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Studies were assessed on demographic and clinical patient characteristics, procedure or treatment type, health-related quality of life, adverse events and safety outcomes, captured by pelvic floor procedure registries or databases that have been established to date. RESULTS From 1662 studies, 29 publications describing 22 different pelvic floor registries and databases were included for analysis, 12 (55%) of which were multicentre. Six (27%) registries and databases involved solely SUI, eight (36%) were regarding POP, and the remaining eight (36%) focussed on both conditions. The majority of registries and databases captured similar details on patient characteristics, comorbidities and other clinical features, procedure or treatment type, health-related quality of life, adverse events, safety and efficacy. CONCLUSION The findings of this scoping review will assist in determining the MDS for the APFPR, an initiative of the Australian government, to improve health and quality of life outcomes of women who undergo pelvic floor reconstructive procedures.","Ruseckaite, Rasa; Daly, Justin O; Dean, Joanne; Ahern, Susannah",International urogynecology journal,119,0

This study estimated, from the payer's perspective, the lifetime costs among patients diagnosed with UC according to stage at diagnosis. Methods This retrospective analysis of the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database identified patients ≥66 years with newly diagnosed UC from 2004-2013. Patients were followed from UC diagnosis to death or last follow-up to estimate lifetime costs. Costs were allocated to 3 phases: diagnosis (≤3 months after diagnosis), terminal (≤3 months before death), and continuation (months between diagnosis and terminal phases). Survival-adjusted lifetime costs (total and major UC-related) were estimated for patients with UC based on stage at diagnosis (stages 0 through IV) and in a subgroup of patients receiving ≥1 systemic line of chemotherapy (LOC). Results The sample included 15,588 patients: 3,446 stage 0 (8% ≥1 LOC; median [IQR] follow-up in months: 44 [23-71]); 3,902 stage I (12% ≥1 LOC; 33 [15-62]); 4,301 stage II (26% ≥1 LOC; 17 [7-39]); 1,612 stage III (25% ≥1 LOC; 17 [7-42]); and 2,327 stage IV (33% ≥1 LOC; 8 [3-18]). Median age was 78 years and 72% were male. Mean lifetime costs were lowest for stage IV patients (stage 0, $151,626; stage 1, $150,123; stage II, $149,728; stage III, $190,996; stage IV, $117,503). Hospitalizations not involving a cystectomy contributed about half of lifetime costs across all stages. Cystectomy contributed 2-13% of the total lifetime UC costs ($3,356 stage 0; $7,011 stage I; $11,855 stage II; $25,509 stage III; $11,693 stage IV). UC-related office visits contributed 8-15% of lifetime costs ($11,717 stage 0; $14,611 stage I; $19,882 stage II; $21,480 stage III; $17,820 stage IV). Conclusion UC continues to be a costly cancer with stage III patients having highest lifetime costs. Hospitalizations drive most of the lifetime costs across all stages; most of these hospitalizations did not involve costs related to cystectomy. Treatment plans requiring shorter and fewer hospitalizations may lessen the economic burden of UC.","Aly, Abdalla; Johnson, Courtney; Doleh, Yunes; Chirikov, Viktor; Botteman, Marc; Shenolikar, Rahul; Hussain, Arif",Journal of clinical pathways : the foundation of value-based care,119,16

Both conventional and deep-sequencing results consistently showed population changes occurred during adaptation to CEK cells. Specifically, 13 amino acid (aa) positions seemed to be targets of selection when comparing the vaccine genome prior to and after seven passages in CEK (CEKp7). Amino acid changes occurred at four positions in the spike (S) gene and, at two positions in the S gene, large shifts in frequencies of aa encoding were observed. CEK adaptation shifted the virus population towards homogeneity in S. The changes achieved in the S1 gene in CEKp7 were maintained after a back-passage in ECE. Outside the S gene, aa changes at three positions and large shifts in frequencies at four positions were observed. Synonymous nucleotide changes and changes in noncoding regions of the genome were observed at eight genome positions. Inoculation of early CEK passages into chickens induced higher antibody levels and CEKp4 induced increased respiratory signs compared to CEKp7. From an applied perspective, the fact that CEK adaptation of embryo-attenuated Ark vaccines reduces population heterogeneity, and that changes do not revert after one replication cycle in ECE or in chickens, provides an opportunity to improve commercial ArkDPI-derived vaccines.","Ghetas, A M; Thaxton, G E; Breedlove, C; van Santen, V L; Toro, H",Avian diseases,119,22

However, this positivism on the market is fogged because the discharge of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites into the environment, including water, also increases due to their inappropriate management, treatment and disposal; now, worldwide, this fact is recognized as an environmental concern and human health risk. Intriguingly, researchers have studied the most effective methods for pharmaceutical removal in wastewater; however, the types of pharmaceuticals investigated in most of these studies do not reflect the most produced and consumed pharmaceuticals on the market. Hence, an attempt was done to analyze the pharmaceutical market, drugs consumption trends and the pharmaceutical research interests worldwide. Notwithstanding, the intensive research work done in different pharmaceutical research fronts such as disposal and fate, environmental impacts and concerns, human health risks, removal, degradation and development of treatment technologies, found that such research is not totally aligned with the market trends and consumption patterns.

Wrist-worn fitness wearable devices record heart beats 24/7 having a complete overview of users' heart status. Due to motion artefacts affecting QRS complexes recording, and the different nature of the heart rate sensor used on wearable devices compared to ECG, traditionally used to compute SDNN24, the estimation of this important Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metric has never been performed from wearable data. We propose an innovative approach to estimate SDNN24 only exploiting the Heart Rate (HR) that is normally available on wearable fitness trackers and less affected by data noise. The standard deviation of inter-beats intervals (SDNN24) and the standard deviation of the Average inter-beats intervals (ANN) derived from the HR (obtained in a time window with defined duration, i.e., 1, 5, 10, 30 and 60 min), i.e., ANN=60HR (SDANNHR24), were calculated over 24 h. Power spectrum analysis using the Lomb-Scargle Peridogram was performed to assess frequency domain HRV parameters (Ultra Low Frequency, Very Low Frequency, Low Frequency, and High Frequency). Due to the fact that SDNN24 reflects the total power of the power of the HRV spectrum, the values estimated from HR measures (SDANNHR24) underestimate the real values because of the high frequencies that are missing. Subjects with low and high cardiovascular risk show different power spectra. In particular, differences are detected in Ultra Low and Very Low frequencies, while similar results are shown in Low and High frequencies. For this reason, we found that HR measures contain enough information to discriminate cardiovascular risk. Semi-continuous measures of HR throughout 24 h, as measured by most wrist-worn fitness wearable devices, should be sufficient to estimate SDNN24 and cardiovascular risk.","Morelli, Davide; Rossi, Alessio; Bartoloni, Leonardo; Cairo, Massimo; Clifton, David A",Sensors (Basel),119,6

We aimed at understanding the perceptions, context and attitudes of individuals with chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic to clarify their potential risk of infection. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was nested in ComPaRe, an e-cohort of adults with chronic conditions, in France. It assessed participants' perception of their risk of severe illness with COVID-19; their context (i.e., work, household, contacts with external people); and their attitudes in situations involving frequent or occasional contacts with symptomatic or asymptomatic people. Data were collected from March 23 to April 2, 2020, during the lockdown in France. Analyses were weighted to represent the demographic characteristics of French patients with chronic conditions. The subgroup of participants at high risk according to the recommendations of the French High Council for Public Health was examined. RESULTS: Among the 7169 recruited participants, 63% patients felt at risk because of severe illness. About one quarter (23.7%) were at risk of infection because they worked outside home, had a household member working outside home or had regular visits from external contacts. Less than 20% participants refused contact with symptomatic people and <20% used masks when in contact with asymptomatic people. Among patients considered at high risk according to the recommendations of the French High Council for Public Health, 20% did not feel at risk, which led to incautious attitudes. CONCLUSION: Individuals with chronic conditions have distorted perceptions of their risk of severe illness with COVID-19. In addition, they are exposed to COVID-19 due to their context or attitudes.","Tran, Viet-Thi; Ravaud, Philippe",PLoS One,119,6

Herein, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to find the association between COVID-19 and cardiovascular complications. We conducted a systematic literature search of the PubMed and Embase databases from 01 December 2019 to 30 November 2020. We then statistically analyzed the incidence of cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients. We included 3044 confirmed COVID-19 cases from 12 studies. The most common cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients were myocardial injury (21.2%, 95% CI 12.3-30.0%) and arrhythmia (15.3%, 95% CI 8.4-22.3%), followed by heart failure (14.4%, 95% CI 5.7-23.1%) and acute coronary syndrome (1.0%, 95% CI 0.5-1.5%). The pooled incidence of heart failure, arrhythmia and myocardial injury in non-survivors were 47.8% (95% CI 41.4-54.2%), 40.3% (95% CI 1.6-78.9%) and 61.7% (95% CI 46.8-76.6%), respectively. Also, the data separately showed significantly higher incidence of heart failure and cardiac injury in non-survivors (relative risks = 5.13, 95% CI 2.46-10.7, Z = 4.36, P = 0.017) and (relative risks = 6.91, 95% CI 3.19-14.95, Z = 4.91, P = 0.009). Myocardial injury and arrhythmia were the most common complications in COVID-19 patients. Myocardial injury and heart failure were more common in patients who died, regardless of a history of cardiovascular disease. The incidence of heart failure and myocardial injury were higher in non-survivors compared to the survivors. Accordingly, in addition to basic support, cardiac reactions of patients with confirmed COVID-19 with or without underlying cardiovascular diseases should be closely monitored.","Zhao, Yu-Hao; Zhao, Lei; Yang, Xin-Chun; Wang, Pan",Rev Cardiovasc Med,119,1

Après avoir défini les grandes caractéristiques de la fonction, à partir de notre expérience clinique, nous chercherons à dégager les invariants devant être conservés dans une situation telle. Parmi quelques mécanismes, le renforcement des assises narcissiques, l’observation de certains comportements prenant le masque de la dépression ou encore la crise identitaire nous permettront de définir des objectifs. Summary The arrival of Covid 19 in nursing homes gave rise to a very specific situation. The appearance of an unknown and frightening pathology in a climate of isolation, with residents confined to their rooms, can only fuel concern and imagination among residents. In the light of the emergence of new needs, and also of upheavals in institutional organization, the aim of this study was to define a functional framework for the psychologist. On the basis of clinical experience, after having defined the main characteristics of the psychologist’s role, we identify conditions that should be maintained in situations of this sort. Among other mechanisms, the strengthening narcissistic foundations, the observation of certain behaviors that could mask depression or again the detection of identity crises could enable the definition of relevant objectives.","Brossard, F.",NPG Neurologie - Psychiatrie - Gériatrie,119,1

ALYN-Pediatric Rehabilitation Hospital in Jerusalem, Israel, responded with alacrity by providing a broad range of rehabilitation services to young people via online therapy during the first 5 months of the pandemic. The objectives of this naturalistic study were: (1) to monitor usage and user experience of online rehabilitation provided to young people receiving out-patient sessions of physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and psychology and (2) to consider the advantages and disadvantages of retaining this model of online treatment in full or in part post-COVID-19. The online rehabilitation treatment program was provided to 147 young people, aged 3 months to 20 years (mean 8.5 y; SD 5.3), and monitored and evaluated via data from the medical records as well as interviews, questionnaires and focus groups. The results use descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze data on the types and frequencies of therapy provided to 147 young people. Over a five month-period, 2392 therapy sessions were provided, 61 therapists from four disciplines were involved and 56.4% of the young people received two or more types of therapies via online rehabilitation. A repeated measures ANOVA showed significant differences over time per therapy. Feedback and recommendations about the process from therapists, parents and young people were collected during two focus groups of the professional staff (n = 12), parents and young people (parents n = 5, young people n = 3). Tele-rehabilitation services were perceived to be beneficial and effective by the great majority of young people, their parents and the healthcare professionals. The results are discussed within the context of conventional therapy as well as in comparison to reports of other online services for similar populations. We conclude that a hybrid approach in which in-person therapy sessions are coordinated with synchronous, online sessions, will provide a best-case fit for young people with chronic disabilities.","Gefen, Naomi; Steinhart, Shoshana; Beeri, Maurit; Weiss, Patrice L",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),119,26
260258,260258,260258,A perspective on early detection systems models for COVID-19 spreading,7.953747,8.254206,2020,"BACKGROUND: Medicines for the treatment of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections are urgently needed. However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those institutions without such facilities or 2019-nCoV. This study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV-related coronavirus model. METHODS: A 2019-nCoV-related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/Guangxi was described. Whether GX_P2V uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of ACE2. The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by GX_P2V infection. The anti-viral activities and anti-viral mechanisms of potential drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay, respectively. RESULTS: The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and uses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three drugs, including cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin, and mefloquine hydrochloride, exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 µmol/L. CEP demonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [EC50] of 0.98 µmol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 µmol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48â±â0.02]â×â10vs. 1.00â±â0.12, tâ=â150.38, Pâ<â0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.). Plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media containing 10 µmol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. Furthermore, we found CEP had potent anti-viral activities against both viral entry (0.46â±â0.12, vs.1.00â±â0.37, tâ=â2.42, Pâ<â0.05) and viral replication ([6.18â±â0.95]â×â10vs. 1.00â±â0.43, tâ=â3.98, Pâ<â0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable model for 2019-nCoV research. CEP, selamectin, and mefloquine hydrochloride are potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Our results strongly suggest that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and further study of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted.","Fan, Hua-Hao; Wang, Li-Qin; Liu, Wen-Li; An, Xiao-Ping; Liu, Zhen-Dong; He, Xiao-Qi; Song, Li-Hua; Tong, Yi-Gang",Chin Med J (Engl),119,21

Their mean age was 56.43 years (range 17-83) and gender ratio (male/female) was 43:45. We tested SARS-CoV-2 RNA with commercial kits, investigated the level of serologic IgM and IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using magnetic particle chemiluminescence immunoassays, and compared the results of serologic tests and nucleic acid test (NAT). Among 88 patients, 95.45% were confirmed as positive by the combination of NAT and antibody test, which was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than by single nucleic acid test (73.86%) or serologic test (65.91%). Then the correlation between temporal profile and the level of antibody response was analyzed. It showed that seroconversion started on day 5 after disease onset and IgG level was rose earlier than IgM. Comparison between patients with different disease severity suggested early seroconversion and high antibody titer were linked with less severe clinical symptoms. These results supported the combination of serologic testing and NAT in routine COVID-19 diagnosis and provided evidence on the temporal profile of antibody response in patients with different disease severity.","Kong, Wen-Hua; Zhao, Rong; Zhou, Jun-Bo; Wang, Fang; Kong, De-Guang; Sun, Jian-Bin; Ruan, Qiong-Fang; Liu, Man-Qing",Virol Sin,119,16

Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 antagonist, has shown to salvage patients with cytokine release storm. In this study, we aim to evaluate therapeutic response of Tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients. A single-arm retrospective review of 40 patients with COVID-19, admitted to The Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi, from March 2020 to May 2020 was performed. Selection of patients for use of Tocilizumab was based on severity of disease, rapid clinical deterioration, presence of CRS and absence of any absolute contraindication to Tocilizumab. Improvement after Tocilizumab was defined as improvement in oxygen requirement and inflammatory parameters. Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines like C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase levels were monitored before and after administering Tocilizumab. Mean age was 62.4 years and 33 (82.5%) were male. 19 (47.5%) patients were critically sick, 18 (45%) were severely sick and 3 (7.5%) were moderately sick. 29 (77.5%) patients showed significant improvement in oxygen requirement, inflammatory parameters and chest x-rays, out of which 28 patients were discharged home. The mean duration between administration of Tocilizumab and overall improvement was 4.3 ± 3.2 days. Hence, Tocilizumab can be used as a possible treatment option in patients with COVID-19 induced CRS but needs monitoring for its adverse effects.","Zain Mushtaq, Muhammad; Bin Zafar Mahmood, Saad; Jamil, Bushra; Aziz, Adil; Ali, Syed Ahsan",Int Immunopharmacol,119,16

The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes embedded in RT practice in the COVID-19 era and to recommend proactive measures to protect RT practice in future pandemics. Materials and Methods: The study was initiated by the ESTRO Radiation Oncology Safety and Quality Committee (ROSQC). A survey consisting of multiple choice, open ended and Likert scale questions was created to analyse the extent of changes embedded in RT practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic under the four domains: patient care, RTT workflow, remote working and RT practice. This online survey was distributed globally in May 2020. Results: 229 respondents across 27 countries completed the survey. 60% of respondents reported continuing/commencing RT in COVID-19 patients. Routine testing of patients and RTTs was not common. Split teams' procedures, hot linacs and separate entrances were implemented by 50% of respondents. Remote working was implemented for RT team members where face to face patient contact was not essential. Lack of staff, connectivity issues and lack of confirmed positive cases in the department were the main reasons cited for not implementing recommended measures. Conclusion: It is suggested that RT departments have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and implemented certain changes in RT practice.

We aimed to measure the impact of the 2020 national COVID-19 lockdown on HIV testing and treatment in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where 1·7 million people are living with HIV. METHODS: In this interrupted time series analysis, we analysed anonymised programmatic data from 65 primary care clinics in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. We included data from people testing for HIV, initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), and collecting ART at participating clinics during the study period, with no age restrictions. We used descriptive statistics to summarise demographic and clinical data, and present crude summaries of the main outcomes of numbers of HIV tests per month, ART initiations per week, and ART collection visits per week, before and after the national lockdown that began on March 27, 2020. We used Poisson segmented regression models to estimate the immediate impact of the lockdown on these outcomes, as well as post-lockdown trends. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2018, and July 31, 2020, we recorded 1â315â439 HIV tests. Between Jan 1, 2018, and June 15, 2020, we recorded 71â142 ART initiations and 2â319â992 ART collection visits. We recorded a median of 41â926 HIV tests per month before lockdown (January, 2018, to March, 2020; IQR 37â838-51â069) and a median of 38â911 HIV tests per month after lockdown (April, 2020, to July, 2020; IQR 32â699-42â756). In the Poisson regression model, taking into account long-term trends, lockdown was associated with an estimated 47·6% decrease in HIV testing in April, 2020 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·524, 95% CI 0·446-0·615). ART initiations decreased from a median of 571 per week before lockdown (IQR 498-678), to 375 per week after lockdown (331-399), with an estimated 46·2% decrease in the Poisson regression model in the first week of lockdown (March 30, 2020, to April 5, 2020; IRR 0·538, 0·459-0·630). There was no marked change in the number of ART collection visits (median 18â519 visits per week before lockdown [IQR 17â074-19â922] vs 17â863 visits per week after lockdown [17â509-18â995]; estimated effect in the first week of lockdown IRR 0·932, 95% CI 0·794-1·093). As restrictions eased, HIV testing and ART initiations gradually improved towards pre-lockdown levels (slope change 1·183/month, 95% CI 1·113-1·256 for HIV testing; 1·156/month, 1·085-1·230 for ART initiations).

The internet has been critical in mediating their personal relationships and their understanding of daily life. Emerging adults are also at unique risk of experiencing intimate partner and sexual violence (IPV & SV) Given the increasing infusion of information communication technology (ICT) into anti-violence advocacy, and the broad use of ICT among college-attending emerging adults, this study aimed to explore how both survivors and advocates are leveraging technology for support. Using a QUAL + qual methodology (Morse and Niehaus, 2009), data were collected as part of an evaluation of campus-based advocacy as implemented in five programs. Interviews took place with 23 campus and community-based advocates, and 25 survivors of interpersonal violence who had accessed campus-based advocacy services. Additionally, 63 survivors who engaged in campus-based advocacy services responded to an online survey. Key domains identified were: 1) technology as a means of informing potential clients about services; 2) the role of technology in help-seeking, including its role in tailoring and extending the reach of services; and 3) the importance of recognizing technology facilitated abuse in the advocacy and education process with emerging adults. As advocacy programs are rapidly shifting to technology facilitated services in the wake of COVID-19, this study provides data on advocate and survivor experiences with technology, which can inform these changes across the spectrum of IPV & SV services.","Voth Schrag, Rachel; Hairston, Dixie; Brown, Megan L; Wood, Leila",J Fam Violence,119,1

Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools. We performed risk of bias evaluation of all included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Results: 2178 articles were retrieved and 11 studies were included. Five cohort studies reported a combined 22 student and 21 staff index cases that exposed 3345 contacts with 18 transmissions (overall infection attack rate (IAR): 0.08%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.00%-0.86%). IARs for students and school staff were 0.15% (95% CI = 0.00%-0.93%) and 0.70% (95% CI = 0.00%-3.56%) respectively. Six cross-sectional studies reported 639 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in 6682 study participants tested [overall SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate: 8.00% (95% CI = 2.17%-16.95%). SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was estimated to be 8.74% (95% CI = 2.34%-18.53%) among students, compared to 13.68% (95% CI = 1.68%-33.89%) among school staff. Gender differences were not found for secondary infection (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 0.50-4.14, P = 0.49) and SARS-CoV-2 positivity (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.72-1.13, P = 0.36) in schools. Fever, cough, dyspnea, ageusia, anosmia, rhinitis, sore throat, headache, myalgia, asthenia, and diarrhoea were all associated with the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (based on two studies). Overall, study quality was judged to be poor with risk of performance and attrition bias, limiting the confidence in the results. Conclusions: There is limited high-quality evidence available to quantify the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools or to compare it to community transmission. Emerging evidence suggests lower IAR and SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate in students compared to school staff. Future prospective and adequately controlled cohort studies are necessary to confirm this finding.","Xu, Wei; Li, Xue; Dozier, Marshall; He, Yazhou; Kirolos, Amir; Lang, Zhongyu; Mathews, Catherine; Siegfried, Nandi; Theodoratou, Evropi",J Glob Health,119,1

Upon viral infection, host cells initiate the innate antiviral response, which primarily involves type I interferons (I-IFNs), to enable rapid elimination of the invading virus. Previous studies revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection limits the expression of I-IFNs in vitro and in vivo, but the underlying mechanism remains incompletely elucidated. In the present study, we performed data mining and longitudinal data analysis using SARS-CoV-2-infected normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and ferrets, and the results confirmed the strong inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the induction of I-IFNs. Moreover, we identified genes that are negatively correlated with IFNB1 expression in vitro and in vivo based on Pearson correlation analysis. We found that SARS-CoV-2 activates numerous intrinsic pathways, such as the circadian rhythm, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, peroxisome, and TNF signaling pathways, to inhibit I-IFNs. These intrinsic inhibitory pathways jointly facilitate the successful immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2. Our study elucidates the underlying mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 evades the host innate antiviral response in vitro and in vivo, providing theoretical evidence for targeting these immune evasion-associated pathways to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Luo, Weisheng; Huang, Lianzhou; Wang, Xiaohui; Ma, Yuying; Xiao, Ji; Song, Xiaowei; Liu, Ping; Wang, Yifei; Wang, Yiliang; Ren, Zhe",Int J Med Sci,119,1

Our assumption is that the visual prediction of a garment's shapes and weights is possible via a neural network that learns the dynamic changes of garments from video sequences. Continuous perception is leveraged during training by inputting consecutive frames, of which the network learns how a garment deforms. To evaluate our hypothesis, we captured a dataset of 40K RGB and 40K depth video sequences while a garment is being manipulated. We also conducted ablation studies to understand whether the neural network learns the physical and dynamic properties of garments. Our findings suggest that a modified AlexNet-LSTM architecture has the best classification performance for the garment's shape and weights. To further provide evidence that continuous perception facilitates the prediction of the garment's shapes and weights, we evaluated our network on unseen video sequences and computed the 'Moving Average' over a sequence of predictions. We found that our network has a classification accuracy of 48% and 60% for shapes and weights of garments, respectively.","Duan, Li; Aragon-Camarasa, Gerardo",,119,14

Concerns have been raised about the quality of this evidence. The aim of this review was to map the nature, scope and quality of evidence syntheses on COVID-19 and to explore the relationship between review quality and the extent of researcher, policy and media interest. DESIGN AND SETTING: A meta-research: systematic review of reviews. INFORMATION SOURCES: PubMed, Epistemonikos COVID-19 evidence, the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection and the WHO COVID-19 database, searched between 10 June 2020 and 15 June 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Any peer-reviewed article reported as a systematic review, rapid review, overview, meta-analysis or qualitative evidence synthesis in the title or abstract addressing a research question relating to COVID-19. Articles described as meta-analyses but not undertaken as part of a systematic or rapid review were excluded. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Abstract and full text screening were undertaken by two independent reviewers. Descriptive information on review type, purpose, population, size, citation and attention metrics were extracted along with whether the review met the definition of a systematic review according to six key methodological criteria. For those meeting all criteria, additional data on methods and publication metrics were extracted. RISK OF BIAS: For articles meeting all six criteria required to meet the definition of a systematic review, AMSTAR-2 ((A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews, version 2.0) was used to assess the quality of the reported methods. RESULTS: 2334 articles were screened, resulting in 280 reviews being included: 232 systematic reviews, 46 rapid reviews and 2 overviews. Less than half reported undertaking critical appraisal and a third had no reproducible search strategy. There was considerable overlap in topics, with discordant findings. Eighty-eight of the 280 reviews met all six systematic review criteria. Of these, just 3 were rated as of moderate or high quality on AMSTAR-2, with the majority having critical flaws: only a third reported registering a protocol, and less than one in five searched named COVID-19 databases. Review conduct and publication were rapid, with 52 of the 88 systematic reviews reported as being conducted within 3 weeks, and a half published within 3 weeks of submission. Researcher and media interest, as measured by altmetrics and citations, was high, and was not correlated with quality. DISCUSSION: This meta-research of early published COVID-19 evidence syntheses found low-quality reviews being published at pace, often with short publication turnarounds. Despite being of low quality and many lacking robust methods, the reviews received substantial attention across both academic and public platforms, and the attention was not related to the quality of review methods. INTERPRETATION: Flaws in systematic review methods limit the validity of a review and the generalisability of its findings. Yet, by being reported as 'systematic reviews', many readers may well regard them as high-quality evidence, irrespective of the actual methods undertaken. The challenge especially in times such as this pandemic is to provide indications of trustworthiness in evidence that is available in 'real time'.

Governments have taken drastic measures to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and the development of safe and efficacious vaccine candidates is being accelerated. The possibility of vaccine-mediated disease enhancement with coronavirus vaccines has been flagged as a potential safety concern, and, despite the urgent need, should be thoroughly assessed as vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are being tested. AREA COVERED: We review the in vivo evidence suggesting a theoretical risk of disease enhancement after vaccination with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccine candidates. We also identify knowledge gaps that need to be filled to maximize the chance of developing a safe vaccine and minimize the risk of encountering disease enhancement in vaccinated individuals after exposure to SARS-CoV-2. EXPERT OPINION: We compile and propose avenues to investigate the risk of vaccine-mediated disease enhancement both during pre-clinical and early clinical development. While the pressing need for a vaccine against COVID-19 (and future epidemic coronaviruses) cannot be ignored, we advocate to keep safety at the center of the debate. Protecting individuals with effective and safe vaccines should be a priority, even during extraordinary times like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zellweger, Raphaël M; Wartel, T Anh; Marks, Florian; Song, Manki; Kim, Jerome H",Expert Rev Vaccines,119,16

Global regulators have highlighted the key role of HCPs in fostering confidence in COVID-19 vaccines. Objective This study aims to gain insight into the views and experiences of HCPs on providing vaccines information to patients. Setting Primary care general practice surgeries and community pharmacies in Ireland. Methods Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 HCPs (five General practitioners [GPs], four practice nurses and five community pharmacists) identified through purposive and convenience sampling. The interviews were analysed by inductive thematic analysis. Main outcome measure Participants' views and experiences of providing vaccines information to patients. Results Five key themes were identified: roles and responsibilities, perception of risk, perception of the public, building a relationship, and emotion. HCPs were motivated by duty and care for their patients. They respected patient autonomy and were driven by their concern for public health. HCPs were influenced by their perception of risk and their perceptions of the public. HCPs practiced patient-centred care by providing tailored vaccines information. They favoured an approach of providing patients with information and support to make their own decision. The topic was emotive; HCPs empathised with patients but were also frustrated by their perceived inability to change some patients' views. Conclusion The provision of vaccines information by HCPs to patients is multifactorial with participants mindful of patient autonomy and the HCP role to support vaccinations as a public health priority. Participants suggested that education and support on vaccines communication would enable them to support the vaccines uptake in their practice.","Loftus, Ruth; Sahm, Laura J; Fleming, Aoife",Int. j. clin. pharm,119,24

METHODS: A web-based survey (Google forms questionnaire) spread via professional and scientific associations, professional WhatsApp and email lists, following a snowball technique was used. Data were collected from May 11th and May 31st, 2020 RESULTS: : A total of 1407 subjects were included in final analyses. 24.7% (348 out of 1407) of HCWs reported symptoms of acute stress (SARS-Q measurement) and 53.6% (754 out of 1407) reported symptoms related to poorer general health (GHQ-28 measurement). A higher risk of having an acute stress disorder was associated to being female, not having access to protective material, and several subjects´ perceived risks. Additionally, poorer overall general health (GHQ>24) was related to being female, working in a geographical area with a high incidence of infection, not being listened to by your co-workers, having a greater perception of stress at work and being able to transmit the infection to others. LIMITATIONS: We must consider a likely memory bias. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of affective and general health symptoms among the HCWs and the critical influence of organizational issues and subjects´ perceived risk should lead health authorities to design future strategies to protect health professional force for facing a potential upcoming epidemiological crisis.","Gonzalo, Rodriguez-Menéndez; Ana, Rubio-García; Patricia, Conde-Alvarez; Laura, Armesto-Luque; Nathalia, Garrido-Torres; Luis, Capitan; Asuncion, Luque; Miguel, Ruiz-Veguilla; Benedicto, Crespo-Facorro",J Affect Disord,119,16

Biologics currently approved for the treatment of psoriasis include tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, interleukin (IL)-17 inhibitors, ustekinumab (an IL-12/23 inhibitor), and IL-23 inhibitors. Data from clinical trials and studies of the safety and efficacy of biologics provide essential information for the personalization of patient care. We discuss the benefits and disadvantages of biologics as a first-line treatment choice, update treatment recommendations according to current evidence, and propose psoriasis treatment algorithms. Our discussion includes the following comorbid conditions: psoriatic arthritis, multiple sclerosis, congestive heart failure, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis B, nonmelanoma skin cancer, lymphoma, and latent tuberculosis. We make evidence-based treatment recommendations for special populations, including pediatric patients, patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and pregnant and breastfeeding patients with psoriasis. Ultimately, individualized recommendations that consider patient preferences, disease severity, comorbid conditions, and additional risk factors should be offered to patients and updated as new trial data emerges.","Thatiparthi, Akshitha; Martin, Amylee; Liu, Jeffrey; Egeberg, Alexander; Wu, Jashin J",Am. j. clin. dermatol,119,29

Underlying diseases predispose the patients to a more severe disease and to a higher mortality rate. However, little evidence exists about COVID-19 outcomes in the pediatric population with congenital heart disease (CHD). Here, we report nine children with COVID-19 and concomitant CHD. METHODS: Our study included nine children with COVID-19 and concomitant CHD who were admitted to Children Medical Center Hospital during March and April 2020. The patients were classified based on the final outcome (death), and their clinical sign and symptoms, type of CHD, and drugs administered were compared. RESULTS: Among the nine patients, two died and we compared different characteristics, laboratory results and clinical findings of these cases based on the mortality. The deceased patients had severe types of CHD, worse arterial blood gases, severe clinical symptoms, higher mean level of partial thromboplastin time and C-reactive protein, and required more medications. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that the general consideration of mild COVID-19 in children does not include patients with CHD and that it is necessary to pay greater attention to children with CHD to determine guidelines for treatment of COVID-19 in these children. Owing to the scarcity of CHD and COVID-19, we reported only nine cases. However, further studies are highly required in this regard.","Haji Esmaeil Memar, Elmira; Pourakbari, Babak; Gorgi, Mojtaba; Sharifzadeh Ekbatani, Meisam; Navaeian, Amene; Khodabandeh, Mahmoud; Mahmoudi, Shima; Mamishi, Setareh",World J Pediatr,119,1

Nevertheless, previous studies reported institutional or individual reluctance of departments or anatomists, respectively, due to an expectation of adverse publicity. This study aimed to investigate whether the official websites of Turkish anatomy departments provided information on body donation and analyzed the content of these websites. Websites of anatomy departments at 100 medical faculties were evaluated. Only 12 departments (12%) provided information on body donation with varying content. A thematic analysis of the information provided revealed five main themes. These were (1) legal aspects, (2) significance, (3) acceptance/rejection criteria, (4) availability, and (5) redirection. All departments (n = 12, 100%) outlined the legal aspects of body donation, 7 departments (58%) highlighted the significance of body donation, 7 departments (58%) provided contact information for potential donors, 5 departments (41%) covered acceptance/rejection criteria, and 3 departments (25%) provided a link to the official website of the Turkish Society of Anatomy and Clinical Anatomy. Thus Turkish anatomy departments were reluctant to provide information on body donation, and the content of provided information varied greatly among departments. This lack information coordination and participation in existing awareness activities for body donation in anatomy department websites may be contributing to low numbers of body donations and donor registrations seen nationally.","Ok, Fatma; Gürses, Ilke Ali",,119,26

This is an observational and cross-sectional study. All patients were asked to fill the clinical assessment form and Beck depression and anxiety inventory. Also, the last two laboratory evaluations during this period were examined. A total of 123 patients performing PD were included. None of the patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. In the total study population, parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum albumin, phosphorus and ferritin levels significantly elevated at the end of 97 ± 31 days. PTH and phosphorus levels remained stable in remote monitoring automated PD (RM-APD) group (p = 0.4 and p = 0.5), they tended to increase in continuous ambulatory PD group and significantly increased in automated PD group (p = 0.09 and p = 0.01 for PTH and p = 0.06 and p = 0.001 for phosphorus, respectively). Moderate to severe depression was associated with dyspnoea, weight gain more than 5 kg, fatigue, palpitation and increased anxiety. PD is a reliable and successful form of dialysis and can be safely administered even if hospital access is restricted. Also, RM-APD may be a better choice because of providing more stable bone-mineral metabolism.

The present review will focus on the repurposing efficacy of the currently used drugs against COVID-19 and their mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, dosing, safety, and their future perspective. Relevant articles with experimental studies conducted in-silico, in-vitro, in-vivo, clinical trials in humans, case reports, and news archives were selected for the review. Number of drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, arbidol, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab and interferons have shown inhibitory effects against the SARS-CoV2 in-vitro as well as in clinical conditions. These drugs either act through virus-related targets such as RNA genome, polypeptide packing and uptake pathways or target host-related pathways involving angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors and inflammatory pathways. Using the basic knowledge of viral pathogenesis and pharmacodynamics of drugs as well as using computational tools, many drugs are currently in pipeline to be repurposed.

This study aims to investigate the spread of diseases among individuals over contact networks by exploring the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in Korea. We present several distinct features of MERS transmission by employing a comprehensive approach in network research to examine both the traced relationship matrix of infected individuals and their bipartite transmission routes among healthcare facilities visited for treatment. The results indicate that a few super-spreaders were more likely to hold certain structural advantages by linking to an exceptional number of other individuals, causing several ongoing transmission events in neighbourhoods without the aid of any intermediary. Thus, the infectious contact network exhibited small-world dynamics characterised by locally clustered contacts exposed to transmission paths via short path lengths. In addition, nosocomial infection analysis shows the pattern of a common-source outbreak followed by secondary person-to-person transmission of the disease. Based on the results, we suggest policy implications related to the redesign of prevention and control strategies against the spread of epidemics.","Yang, Chang Hoon; Jung, Hyejin",Sci Rep,119,24

This article presents a model of cyberchondria during public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The factors that contribute to cyberchondria at this time include (a) a heightened perception of threat and fear of a newly identified and poorly understood disease; (b) difficulty in coping with uncertainty associated with the pandemic; (c) lack of authoritative and trustworthy sources of relevant health information; (d) difficulty in coping with abundance of information that is often confusing, conflicting, unverified and constantly updated, along with a decreased ability to filter out unnecessary information; and (e) inability of excessive online health information seeking to provide the necessary information and deliver reassurance. These factors amplify fear and distress, which increases the perception of threat and uncertainty and perpetuates further online health searches. Cyberchondria has significant public health implications because of the associated distress or functional impairment and effects on health behaviors. Cyberchondria should be addressed by targeting a heightened perception of threat, improving management of uncertainty and online health information and promoting an ability to critically appraise the results of online health searches. This should contribute to a better online health information literacy.

This is interesting for two reasons. First, most studies regarding the accuracy of the B-S formulas have been done under regular or normal market conditions (granted, a fuzzy concept), not under conditions of severe market stress. And second, these two crises are quite different in nature. The subprime crisis was generated within a specific segment of the capital markets and affected only some sectors of the economy;the Covid-19 crisis was due to an external shock and still continues to have a much wider impact. We find, in agreement with previous studies under different circumstances, that the accuracy of these formulas is very poor. Moreover, we find that the degree of mispricing, which is significant and in many cases exceed 100%, is manifest in both crises, and in all scenarios analyzed.","Redroban, Shirley Cifuentes Arturo",Journal of Corporate Accounting &amp; Finance,119,21

METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted at a tertiary rheumatology department in Israel. Consecutive patients completed a questionnaire and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleoprotein IgG (N-IgG). If this was positive, an anti-S1/S2 spike IgG (S-IgG) test was done. If both were positive, the patient was considered seropositive. Seropositive patients were retested after 3 months. RESULTS: The study included 572 AIIRD patients. Thirty patients were found seropositive, for a seroprevalence of 5.24%. The seropositive rate was significantly lower for patients treated with immunosuppressive medications (3.55%, p<=0.01), and specifically for patients treated with biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) (2.7%, p<=0.05). These associations remained significant in the multivariate regressions adjusting for age, sex and exposure to a known COVID-19 patient. A second serology test 3 months later was collected in 21 of the 30 seropositive patients. In a mean+/-standard deviation (SD) of 166.63+/-40.76 days between PCR and second serology, 85% were still positive for N-IgG, and 100% were still positive for S-IgG, with a higher mean+/-SD titre compared to the first S-IgG (166.77+/-108.77 vs. 132.44+/-91.18, respectively, p<=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 in AIIRD patients may be affected be immunosuppressive treatment, especially bDMARDs. In patients with AIIRD, titres of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, especially N-IgG antibodies, fade with time, while S-IgG antibodies persist.","Eviatar, T.; Furer, V.; Polachek, A.; Levartovsky, D.; Elalouf, O.; Zisapel, M.; Halperin, T.; Turner, D.; Paran, D.; Pel, S.; Nevo, S.; Elkayam, O.",Clinical & Experimental Rheumatology,119,22

As a vulnerable population, university students are at high risk during the epidemic, as they have high mobility and often overlook the severity of the disease because they receive incomplete information about the epidemic. In addition to the risk of death from infection, the epidemic has placed substantial psychological pressure on the public. In this respect, university students are more prone to psychological problems induced by the epidemic compared to the general population because for most students, university life is their first time outside the structure of the family, and their mental development is still immature. Internal and external expectations and academic stress lead to excessive pressure on students, and unhealthy lifestyles also deteriorate their mental health. The outbreak of COVID-19 was a significant social event, and it could potentially have a great impact on the life and the mental health of university students. Therefore, it is of importance to investigate university students' mental health status during the outbreak of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The principal objective of this study was to investigate the influencing factors of the psychological responses of Chinese university students during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This study used data from a survey conducted in China between February 21 and 24, 2020, and the data set contains demographic information and psychological measures including the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, the Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the compulsive behaviors portion of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. A total of 2284 questionnaires were returned, and 2270 of them were valid and were used for analysis. The Mann-Whitney U test for two independent samples and binary logistic regression models were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Our study surveyed 563 medical students and 1707 nonmedical students. Among them, 251/2270 students (11.06%) had mental health issues. The results showed that contact history of similar infectious disease (odds ratio [OR] 3.363, P=.02), past medical history (OR 3.282, P<.001), and compulsive behaviors (OR 3.525, P<.001) contributed to the risk of mental health issues. Older students (OR 0.928, P=.02), regular daily life during the epidemic outbreak (OR 0.410, P<.001), exercise during the epidemic outbreak (OR 0.456, P<.001), and concern related to COVID-19 (OR 0.638, P=.002) were protective factors for mental health issues. CONCLUSIONS: According to the study results, mental health issues have seriously affected university students, and our results are beneficial for identifying groups of university students who are at risk for possible mental health issues so that universities and families can prevent or intervene in the development of potential mental health issues at the early stage of their development.","Zhang, Xudong; Shi, Xin; Wang, Yang; Jing, Huiquan; Zhai, Qingqing; Li, Kunhang; Zhao, Dan; Zhong, Shiyu; Song, Yuequn; Zhang, Feng; Bao, Yijun",J Med Internet Res,119,1

We analyze a diversity of publicly available modern preparedness plans against the context of a historically-based fictional outbreak control strategy described in Defoe's A Journal of the Plague Year (published 1720). We identify themes in preparedness planning that remain unchanged from historical settings even though they continue to be actively evaluated in planning efforts. More importantly, we isolate critical modern challenges in preparedness planning that remain predominantly unsolved. These modern, unsolved issues offer best avenues for meaningful improvement.

However, their efforts and health status have not been well documented. We aimed to investigate the working conditions and health status of front line public health workers in China during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: Between 18 February and 1 March 2020, we conducted an online cross-sectional survey of 2,313 CDC workers and 4,004 PHI workers in five provinces across China experiencing different scales of COVID-19 epidemic. We surveyed all participants about their work conditions, roles, burdens, perceptions, mental health, and self-rated health using a self-constructed questionnaire and standardised measurements (i.e., Patient Health Questionnaire and General Anxiety Disorder scale). To examine the independent associations between working conditions and health outcomes, we used multivariate regression models controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and poor self-rated health was 21.3, 19.0, and 9.8%, respectively, among public health workers (27.1, 20.6, and 15.0% among CDC workers and 17.5, 17.9, and 6.8% among PHI workers). The majority (71.6%) made immense efforts in both field and non-field work. Nearly 20.0% have worked all night for more than 3 days, and 45.3% had worked throughout the Chinese New Year holiday. Three risk factors and two protective factors were found to be independently associated with all three health outcomes in our final multivariate models: working all night for >3 days (multivariate odds ratio [ORm]=1.67~1.75, p<0.001), concerns about infection at work (ORm=1.46~1.89, p<0.001), perceived troubles at work (ORm=1.10~1.28, p<0.001), initiating COVID-19 prevention work after January 23 (ORm=0.78~0.82, p=0.002~0.008), and ability to persist for > 1 month at the current work intensity (ORm=0.44~0.55, p<0.001).

Given this situation the modeling of the transmission of the disease is still the subject of research with the ultimate goal of understanding the dynamics of the disease and assessing the efficacy of different mitigation strategies undertaken by the affected countries. We propose a mathematical model for COVID-19 transmission. The model is structured upon five classes: an individual can be susceptible, exposed, infectious, quarantined or removed. The model is based on a nonlinear incidence rate, takes into account the influence of media on public behavior, and assumes the recovery rate to be dependent on the hospital-beds to population ratio. A detailed analysis of the proposed model is carried out, including the existence and uniqueness of solutions, stability analysis of the disease-free equilibrium (symmetry) and sensitivity analysis. We found that if the basic reproduction number is less than unity the system can exhibit Hopf and backward bifurcations for some range of parameters. Numerical simulations using parameter values fitted to Saudi Arabia are carried out to support the theoretical proofs and to analyze the effects of hospital-beds to population ratio, quarantine, and media effects on the predicted nonlinear behavior.","Ajbar, Abdelhamid Alqahtani Rubayyi T.; Boumaza, Mourad",Symmetry,119,16

Several studies have recently been published on the impact of COVID-19-related loneliness among older populations, but little has been written about the experiences of already-lonely older individuals; those who had lived with persistent loneliness before the advent of COVID-19. This qualitative study sought to understand how already-lonely older individuals navigated and endured the social isolation of the pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twelve semistructured interviews were conducted with individuals aged 65 or older who scored a 6 or above on the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Risk screening tool. Interviews were coded using the constant comparative method. Themes and understandings of loneliness that reoccurred within and across interviews were identified and collected. RESULTS: Already-isolated older interviewees did not necessarily experience the abject loneliness hypothesized by analysts. Most interviewees used longstanding arrangements, in place to mitigate loneliness and endure social isolation, to manage the social deprivation of COVID-19. As a result, their loneliness did not compound during long bouts of mandated social isolation. To the contrary, loneliness during the pandemic appeared to carry a new valence for interviewees, as COVID-19 imbued their isolation with new meaning, rendering their loneliness necessary and responsible. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Exploring individuals’ subjective perceptions of loneliness can help provide a deeper understanding of what it means to be isolated and alone during COVID-19 and aid in designing strategies to mitigate loneliness.","Bundy, Henry; Lee, Heather M; Sturkey, Kim N; Caprio, Anthony J",Gerontologist,119,3

Nevertheless, scarce information was present dealing with the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of these infections in Greece and the efficacy of currently applied control strategies. To fill this gap, a specific epidemiological study was designed. A total of 106 broiler and layer farms, including 10 backyard and 96 commercial flocks, were sampled between March 2016 and May 2017, and the obtained tracheal swabs were tested for IBV and aMPV using RT-PCR based techniques followed by sequencing. For each farm, data regarding production type, flock features, clinical signs, and vaccination program were also recorded. Different associations between vaccination protocol, production type, animal category, birds density, age, presence of clinical signs, and IBV and/or aMPV infection were tested. Both IBV and aMPV field strain prevalence were proven high, approximately 20 and 30%, respectively, being the GI-19 lineage (14 out of 19; 73.6%) and B subtype (30 out of 30; 100%), the most commonly detected IBV and aMPV genetic types. Infection with IBV field strains was significantly associated with clinical sign presence (odds ratio = 8.55 [95CI = 2.17–42.90]). Remarkably, only the vaccination protocol involving a double vaccination at 1 D of age was proven protective against IBV-induced symptomatology, with the odds of developing disease being 4.14 [95CI = 1.34–14.51] times lower. No association was demonstrated between aMPV infection and clinical outbreaks or between aMPV and IBV detection, suggesting the marginal role of the former pathogen in poultry farming. Globally, the present study provides the first detailed investigation of the epidemiological scenario of 2 viruses traditionally considered of pivotal relevance in poultry farming and demonstrates that remarkable benefits could be obtained with just minor adjustments in vaccination protocols.","Andreopoulou, Marianna; Franzo, Giovanni; Tucciarone, Claudia M; Prentza, Zoi; Koutoulis, Konstantinos C; Cecchinato, Mattia; Chaligianni, Ilias",Poult Sci,119,20

For that, this research investigated how lockdown measures and psychological distance influenced social anxiety in the pandemic region. The Chinese national data was analyzed for the outcome. The results showed that (1) psychological distance mediated the relationship between pandemic COVID-19 severity and social anxiety, (2) lockdown measures buffered the detrimental effect of the COVID-19 pandemic severity on social anxiety, (3) lockdown measures moderated the mediation effect of psychological distancing on social anxiety caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, under the SOR framework, the lockdown measures had a buffer effect on social anxiety in pandemic regions, with the mediating role of psychological distancing.","Zheng, Lei; Miao, Miao; Lim, JiYoon; Li, Maorui; Nie, Shu; Zhang, Xiaojun",Int J Environ Res Public Health,119,18

In order to interpret syndromic information better, we devised a microbiological feasibility study (GrippeWeb‐Plus) to test whether self‐collection of anterior nasal swabs is operationally possible, acceptable for participants and can yield valid data. METHODS: We recruited 103 GrippeWeb participants (73 adults and 30 children) and provided them with a kit, instructions and a questionnaire for each sample. In the first half of 2016, participants took an anterior nasal swab and sent it to the Robert Koch Institute whenever an acute respiratory illness occurred. Reporting of illnesses through the GrippeWeb platform continued as usual. We analysed swabs for the presence of human c‐myc‐DNA and 22 viral and bacterial pathogens. After the study, we sent participants an evaluation questionnaire. We analysed timeliness, completeness, acceptability and validity. RESULTS: One hundred and two participants submitted 225 analysable swabs. Ninety per cent of swabs were taken within 3 days of symptom onset. Eighty‐nine per cent of swabs had a corresponding reported illness in the GrippeWeb system.

With increasing morbidity and mortality, the need for novel drug candidates is under great demand. The investigations are progressing towards COVID-19 therapeutics. Among the various strategies employed, the use of repurposed drugs is competing along with novel drug inventions. Based on the therapeutic significance, the chemical constituents from the extract of Tinospora cordifolia belonging to various classes like alkaloids, lignans, steroids and terpenoids are investigated as potential drug candidates for COVID-19. The inhibition potential of the proposed compounds against viral spike protein and human receptor ACE2 were evaluated by computational molecular modeling (Auto dock), along with their ADME/T properties. Prior to docking, the initial geometry of the compounds were optimized by Density functional theory (DFT) method employing B3LYP hybrid functional and 6–311 + + G (d,p) basis set. The results of molecular docking and ADME/T studies have revealed 6 constituents as potential drug candidates that can inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the human receptor ACE2 protein. The narrowed down list of constituents from Tinospora cordifolia paved way for further tuning their ability to inhibit COVID-19 by modifying the chemical structures and by employing computational geometry optimization and docking methods.

The goal of this study was to identify genetic features unique to KM22 by comparing the genome sequence of KM22 to the laboratory reference strain RB50. To gain a broader perspective of the genetic relationship of KM22 among other B. bronchiseptica strains, selected genes of KM22 were then compared to five other B. bronchiseptica strains isolated from different hosts. Overall, the KM22 genome sequence is more similar to the genome sequences of the strains isolated from animals than the strains isolated from humans. The majority of virulence gene expression in Bordetella is positively regulated by the two-component sensory transduction system BvgAS. bopN, bvgA, fimB, and fimC were the most highly conserved BvgAS-regulated genes present in all seven strains analyzed. In contrast, the BvgAS-regulated genes present in all seven strains with the highest sequence divergence werefimN, fim2, fhaL, andfhaS. A total of eight major fimbrial subunit genes were identified in KM22. Quantitative real-time PCR data demonstrated that seven of the eight fimbrial subunit genes identified in KM22 are expressed and regulated by BvgAS. The annotation of the KM22 genome sequence, coupled with the comparative genomic analyses reported in this study, can be used to facilitate the development of vaccines with improved efficacy towards B. bronchiseptica in swine to decrease the prevalence and disease burden caused by this pathogen.","Nicholson, Tracy L.; Shore, Sarah M.; Register, Karen B.; Bayles, Darrell O.; Kingsley, Robert A.; Brunelle, Brian W.",Vet Microbiol,119,21

MATERIALS AND METHODS: the ESTRO NS committee launched a survey addressed to all European National Societies, available online from June 5(th) to October 30(th) 2018. Questions were divided into three main sections: 1. general information about NS; 2. relevant activities (to understand the landscape of each NS context of action); 3. relevant needs (to understand how ESTRO can support the NS). Eighty-nine European NS were invited to participate. Respondents were asked to rank ESTRO milestones in order of importance, indicating the level of priority to their society. RESULTS: a total of 58 out of 89 NS (65.2%) from 31 European countries completed the questionnaire. The majority of NS ranked “Optimal patient care to cure cancer and to reduce treatment-related toxicity” as the highest level of priority. This aligns well with the ESTRO vision 2030 “Optimal health for all together.” NS also indicated a high need for more consensus guidelines and exchange of best practices, access to high quality accredited education, implementation of the ESTRO School Core Curriculum at the national level, and defining quality indicators and standard in Radiation Oncology, improved communication and increased channelling of information.

Neuronal death inevitably leads to degeneration of axons and secondary degeneration of the myelin surrounding them. Failure of synthesis of normal myelin proteins or lipids is referred to as hypomyelination or dysmyelination. Primary demyelination involves the destruction of myelin with relative sparing of axons, whereas secondary demy­elination includes those disorders in which myelin is involved only after damage to neurons and axons occurs.

However, as the number of new daily confirmed cases begins to decrease, governments must decide how to release their populations from quarantine as efficiently as possible without overwhelming their health services. We applied an optimal control framework to an adapted Susceptible-Exposure-Infection-Recovery (SEIR) model framework to investigate the efficacy of two potential lockdown release strategies, focusing on the UK population as a test case. To limit recurrent spread, we find that ending quarantine for the entire population simultaneously is a high-risk strategy, and that a gradual re-integration approach would be more reliable. Furthermore, to increase the number of people that can be first released, lockdown should not be ended until the number of new daily confirmed cases reaches a sufficiently low threshold. We model a gradual release strategy by allowing different fractions of those in lockdown to re-enter the working non-quarantined population. Mathematical optimization methods, combined with our adapted SEIR model, determine how to maximize those working while preventing the health service from being overwhelmed. The optimal strategy is broadly found to be to release approximately half the population 2–4 weeks from the end of an initial infection peak, then wait another 3–4 months to allow for a second peak before releasing everyone else. We also modeled an “on-off” strategy, of releasing everyone, but re-establishing lockdown if infections become too high. We conclude that the worst-case scenario of a gradual release is more manageable than the worst-case scenario of an on-off strategy, and caution against lockdown-release strategies based on a threshold-dependent on-off mechanism. The two quantities most critical in determining the optimal solution are transmission rate and the recovery rate, where the latter is defined as the fraction of infected people in any given day that then become classed as recovered. We suggest that the accurate identification of these values is of particular importance to the ongoing monitoring of the pandemic.","Rawson, Thomas; Brewer, Tom; Veltcheva, Dessislava; Huntingford, Chris; Bonsall, Michael B.",Front Public Health,119,33

Therefore, there is an acute issue of maintaining health and prolonging active working longevity, as well as implementation of early monitoring and prevention of premature aging and age-related disorders to avoid early disability. Traditional indicators of biological age are not always informative and often require extensive and expensive analysis. The study of blood factors is a simple and easily accessible way to assess individual health and supplement the traditional indicators of a person’s biological age with new objective criteria. With age, the processes of growth and development, tissue regeneration and repair decline; they are gradually replaced by enhanced catabolism, inflammatory cell activity, and insulin resistance. The number of senescent cells supporting the inflammatory loop rises; cellular clearance by autophagy and mitophagy slows down, resulting in mitochondrial and cellular damage and dysfunction. Monitoring of circulated blood factors not only reflects these processes, but also allows suggesting medical intervention to prevent or decelerate the development of age-related diseases. We review the age-related blood factors discussed in recent publications, as well as approaches to slowing aging for healthy and active longevity.","Rybtsova, Natalia; Berezina, Tatiana; Kagansky, Alexander; Rybtsov, Stanislav",Biomedicines,119,24

The aim of our single-center pilot study is to determine the influence of SARS-CoV-2 infection on CKD patients’ (dialyzed or not) outcome and hospitalization rate. METHOD: We evaluated the patients diagnosed with COVID-19, admitted in our Department between October and December 2020. The inclusion criteria were: age > 18 years old, diagnosis of CKD – predialysis and hemodialyzed patients. The exclusion criteria were: patients without pre-existing CKD. All included subjects signed the patients’ consent. To all included patients we performed the following tests: total blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, ferritin, serum free iron, serum creatinine, urea, uric acid, calcemia, total proteins, electrolytes and acid-base balance, urinary exams (including urine culture), coagulation and lipid profile, quantitative D-dimer, IL-6, procalcitonin, and imaging tests (CT, pulmonary Rx, abdominal ultrasonography). The patients were monitored by the infectious disease medical team that adjusted the therapy according to the patients’ lab and imagistic results. The specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection included primary anti-interleukin receptor monoclonal antibody drugs (such as Anakinra, Tocilizumab), corticotherapy (dexamethasone), anti-retroviral therapy (remdesivir, favipiravir) only in hemodialyzed patients or in those presenting an eGFR > 30 mL/min, antibiotics, antifungal drugs, and oxygen-therapy. Usually, anti-interleukin receptor monoclonal antibody consisted in 7 doses, administrated every 48 hours. The dose of all other recommended drugs was adapted according to the patients’ eGFR. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were admitted in our Department and were under our care, presenting medium or severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 38 patients were considered eligible: 21 male patients (mean age 63.52 ± 13.82 years), and 17 female patients (mean age 67.24 ± 12.83 years). 31.57% represented the percentage of death during the hospitalization (due to the severity of the disease, 4 patients died within 24 hours) in patients presenting heterogenous comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, pre-existing glomerulonephritis and/or oncological pathologies; we also noticed that female gender represented 58.33% of the deceased patients. The mean hospitalization period in the deceased patients was 6.42 ± 5.38 days – 4 ± 3.21 days in female gender, and 9.8 ± 6.30 days in male gender. CONCLUSION: Most of our patients, although diagnosed with medium and severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, presented a favorable evolution, and an adequate response to the specific medication. We observed that most of the deceased cases were female patients, and compared to the male deceased subject, female deceased patients presented a lower period of hospitalization. Therefore, probably female CKD patients with comorbidities and diagnosed with COVID-19 are more predisposed to an unfavorable prognosis. Further and larger clinical trials are necessary to validate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on mortality in CKD patients.","Peride, Ileana; Niculae, Andrei; Balas, Corina Adriana; Nechita, Ana-Maria; Checherita, Ionel Alexandru",Nephrol Dial Transplant,119,20

As such, an aggressive initial innate immune response favors the host in contrast to a detrimental prolonged inflammation. The complement pathway bridges innate and adaptive immune system and contributes to the response by directly clearing pathogens or infected cells, as well as recruiting proinflammatory immune cells and regulating inflammation. However, the impact of modulating complement activation in viral infections is still unclear. In this work, we targeted the complement decay-accelerating factor (DAF/CD55), a surface protein that protects cells from non-specific complement attack, and analyzed its role in IAV infections. We found that DAF modulates IAV infection in vivo, via an interplay with the antigenic viral proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), in a strain specific manner. Our results reveal that, contrary to what could be expected, DAF potentiates complement activation, increasing the recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes and T cells. We also show that viral NA acts on the heavily sialylated DAF and propose that the NA-dependent DAF removal of sialic acids exacerbates complement activation, leading to lung immunopathology. Remarkably, this mechanism has no impact on viral loads, but rather on the host resilience to infection, and may have direct implications in zoonotic influenza transmissions.","Santos, Nuno Brito; Vaz da Silva, Zoé Enderlin; Gomes, Catarina; Reis, Celso A.; Amorim, Maria João",PLoS Pathog,119,24

A defensive vision of NCIT procedure (maximum standard error only in favor) had a sensitivity of 15.09% (95% CI, 6.75–27.59%). Conclusions: The use of NCITs in a triage provides little value for detection of COVID-19. Moreover, it provides a false sense of protection against the disease while possibly discriminating individuals that could present fever due to other reasons, such as oncologic treatments, where fever is a common therapeutical consequence. The consumption of qualified human resources should be considered, especially in the context of the shortage of healthcare professionals worldwide.","Pană, Bogdan C.; Lopes, Henrique; Furtunescu, Florentina; Franco, Diogo; Rapcea, Anca; Stanca, Mihai; Tănase, Alina; Coliţă, Anca",Front Public Health,119,17

The increased susceptibility to severe disease in the elderly and individuals with co-morbidities argues for an initial defect in anti-viral host defense mechanisms. Long-term boosting of innate immune responses, also termed ‘trained immunity’, by certain live vaccines (BCG, oral polio vaccine, measles) induces heterologous protection against infections, through epigenetic, transcriptional and functional reprogramming of innate immune cells. We propose that induction of trained immunity by whole microorganism vaccines may represent an important tool for reducing susceptibility and severity to SARS-CoV-2.","Netea, Mihai G.; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J.; Domínguez-Andrés, Jorge; Curtis, Nigel; van Crevel, Reinout; van de Veerdonk, Frank L.; Bonten, Marc",Cell,119,20
