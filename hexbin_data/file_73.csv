109,"The Trojan Chicken Study, Minnesota",2006-05-11,We conducted a study in the summer of 2004 at county fairs in the Midwest to investigate the role poultry exhibits have in spreading avian pathogens to humans. A nearly invisible powder (pathogen surrogate) that fluoresces under UV light was surreptitiously sprinkled each day on 1 show bird at each of 2 fairs. A UV light box was used to daily examine the hands of 94 poultry-exhibit participants (blinded regarding UV box results) for up to 4 days during the poultry shows. Enrollment and end-of-study questionnaires collected data on pathogen risk factors. Eight (8.5%) of 94 participants had evidence of fluorescent powder contamination (95% confidence interval 2.76%–14.26%). This contamination and infrequent handwashing practices suggest that county fairs are a possible venue for animal-to-human pathogen transmission.,"Olson, Sandra R.; Gray, Gregory C.",Emerg Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1952212/,73

1885,Determining the Provincial and National Burden of Influenza-Associated Severe Acute Respiratory Illness in South Africa Using a Rapid Assessment Methodology,2015-07-08,"Local disease burden data are necessary to set national influenza vaccination policy. In 2010 the population of South Africa was 50 million and the HIV prevalence was 11%. We used a previously developed methodology to determine severe influenza burden in South Africa. Hospitalized severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) incidence was calculated, stratified by HIV status, for four age groups using data from population-based surveillance in one site situated in Gauteng Province for 2009–2011. These rates were adjusted for each of the remaining 8 provinces based on their prevalence of risk factors for pneumonia and healthcare-seeking behavior. We estimated non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI from healthcare utilization surveys at two sites and used the percent of SARI cases positive for influenza from sentinel surveillance to derive the influenza-associated SARI rate. We applied rates of hospitalized and non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI to census data to calculate the national number of cases. The percent of SARI cases that tested positive for influenza ranged from 7–17% depending on age group, year, province and HIV status. In 2010, there were an estimated 21,555 total severe influenza cases in HIV-uninfected individuals and 13,876 in HIV-infected individuals. In 2011, there were an estimated 29,892 total severe influenza cases in HIV-uninfected individuals and 17,289 in HIV-infected individuals. The incidence of influenza-associated SARI was highest in children <5 years and was higher in HIV-infected than HIV-uninfected persons in all age groups. Influenza virus was associated with a substantial amount of severe disease, especially in young children and HIV-infected populations in South Africa.","Murray, Jillian; Cohen, Adam; Walaza, Sibongile; Groome, Michelle; Madhi, Shabir; Variava, Ebrahim; Kahn, Kathleen; Dawood, Halima; Tempia, Stefano; Tshangela, Akhona; Venter, Marietje; Feikin, Daniel; Cohen, Cheryl",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4496064/,73
1969,Possible Role of Rickettsia felis in Acute Febrile Illness among Children in Gabon,2015-10-11,"Rickettsia felis has been reported to be a cause of fever in sub-Saharan Africa, but this association has been poorly evaluated in Gabon. We assessed the prevalence of this bacterium among children <15 years of age in 4 areas of Gabon; the locations were in urban, semiurban, and rural areas. DNA samples from 410 febrile children and 60 afebrile children were analyzed by quantitative PCR. Overall, the prevalence of R. felis among febrile and afebrile children was 10.2% (42/410 children) and 3.3% (2/60 children), respectively. Prevalence differed among febrile children living in areas that are urban (Franceville, 1.3% [1/77]), semiurban (Koulamoutou, 2.1% [3/141]), and rural (Lastourville, 11.2% [15/134]; Fougamou, 39.7% [23/58]). Furthermore, in a rural area (Fougamou), R. felis was significantly more prevalent in febrile (39.7% [23/58]) than afebrile children (5.0% [1/20]). Additional studies are needed to better understand the pathogenic role of R. felis in this part of the world.","Mourembou, Gaël; Lekana-Douki, Jean Bernard; Mediannikov, Oleg; Nzondo, Sydney Maghendji; Kouna, Lady Charlene; Essone, Jean Claude Biteghe Bi; Fenollar, Florence; Raoult, Didier",Emerg Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4593428/,73

3534,Overproduction of IL-6 and Type-I IFN in a Lethal Case of Chikungunya Virus Infection in an Elderly Man During the 2017 Italian Outbreak,2018-10-25,"Chikungunya fever is caused by Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and is generally considered a self-limiting disease. However, severe clinical presentations with a high mortality rate have been reported in association with underlying medical conditions. This study reports the molecular characterization of the virus and an abnormal pattern of circulating cytokines in a unique lethal CHIKV case during the 2017 outbreak in Italy, which involved an elderly patient with underlying cardiac disease. Analysis of inflammatory cytokines revealed a strong increase of interferon (IFN)-α and IFN-β, as well as interleukin-6, suggesting a possible role of type-I IFN in the cytokine storm, which may be correlated with unfavorable prognosis of CHIKV infection.","Colavita, Francesca; Vita, Serena; Lalle, Eleonora; Carletti, Fabrizio; Bordi, Licia; Vincenti, Donatella; Pozzetto, Irene; Aiuti, Massimo; Vairo, Francesco; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Lichtner, Miriam; Castilletti, Concetta",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6284464/,73

Problems with currently available molecular assays include a lack of knowledge about the extent of microbial nucleic acid in “normal” hosts, concentration of agent material in small volume samples, lack of microbiologist expertise, lack of adequate reimbursement, and difficulty with validation based on conventional methods. Clinicians must appreciate the shortcomings of new technology to use it effectively and appropriately. However, we are realizing tangible progress in our ability to detect new etiological agents; the availability of rapid, accurate diagnostic tests for previously difficult infections; and advances into new, human response—based paradigms for diagnostic testing.","Reller, L.

7216,"Serological Investigation of Subclinical Influenza A(H7H9) Infection Among Healthcare and Non–Healthcare Workers in Zhejiang Province, China",2013-09-15,"Acute exacerbations are significant events in the course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Modern diagnostic techniques have revealed an infectious cause for the majority of exacerbations. Common respiratory viruses contribute to 25%–50% of exacerbations. Detection of viral nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swab or sputum samples has become the preferred method to study viral exacerbations instead of viral cultures and serologic examination. Clinical application of such molecular detection requires additional studies to clarify interpretation of a positive result. Bacteria account for 25%–50% of exacerbations. Studies comparing molecular detection of bacteria in sputum with conventional culture techniques have shown that a substantial proportion of bacteria are not detected by the latter method. However, as with molecular viral detection, clinical application of molecular bacterial diagnosis requires additional studies. Although still faced with several challenges and requiring additional development, it is quite likely that molecular methods will become the preferred methods for determining the etiology of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","Sethi, Sanjay",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107946/,73
7220,Low Serum Mannose-Binding Lectin Level Increases the Risk of Death due to Pneumococcal Infection,2008-08-15,"Background. Human bocavirus (HBoV) was recently discovered in children with respiratory tract disease and gastroenteritis. The causative role of HBoV in human gastroenteritis remains uncertain, and, to our knowledge, no previous case-control study has studied the relationship between HBoV and gastroenteritis. Methods. We conducted a case-control study that examined stool samples from 397 children with diarrhea and from 115 asymptomatic control subjects. HBoV was detected using polymerase chain reaction. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the HBoV loads in case and control groups. Common enteric viruses were examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, polymerase chain reaction, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results. At least 1 viral agent was discovered in 60.2% of cases. HBoV was detected in 14 samples, and 9 were coinfected with either rotavirus (7 of 14 samples) or human calicivirus (2 of 14). Many (8 [57.1%] of 14) of the HBoV infections occurred during September-December 2006. Most (12 [85.7%]) of the HBoV-infected children were 7–18 months of age. The percentage of children with HBoV infection did not differ significantly between case patients and control subjects (3.5% vs. 3.5%), and the statistical analysis did not support a correlation between HBoV infection and more-severe clinical symptoms. The viral load differences between the 2 groups were not statistically significant (P = .09, by log-normal Student's t test). In addition, the VP1/VP2 partial gene of HBoV from case patients and control subjects showed minimal sequence variation. Conclusions. A single genetic lineage of HBoV was revealed in persons in China. Despite its high prevalence in stool samples, our study does not support a causative role of HBoV in gastroenteritis.","Cheng, Wei-xia; Jin, Yu; Duan, Zhao-jun; Xu, Zi-qian; Qi, Hong-mei; Zhang, Qing; Yu, Jie-mei; Zhu, Lin; Jin, Miao; Liu, Na; Cui, Shu-xian; Li, Hui-ying; Fang, Zhao-yin",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107984/,73
7239,Clinical and Virological Characteristics of Acute Sinusitis in Children,2019-11-15,"BACKGROUND: Presatovir significantly reduced nasal viral load, signs, and symptoms of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in a human challenge study. We evaluated presatovir in hematopoietic-cell transplant (HCT) recipients with RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). METHODS: Patients with confirmed RSV in upper and lower respiratory tract and new chest X-ray abnormalities were randomized (1:1), stratified by supplemental oxygen and ribavirin use, to receive oral presatovir 200 mg or placebo every 4 days for 5 doses. The primary endpoint was time-weighted average change in nasal RSV viral load through day 9. Secondary endpoints included supplemental oxygen-free days, incident respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: From January 31, 2015, to March 20, 2017, 60 patients from 17 centers were randomized (31 presatovir, 29 placebo); 59 received study treatment (50 allogeneic, 9 autologous HCT). In the efficacy population (29 presatovir, 28 placebo), presatovir treatment did not significantly reduce time-weighted average change in viral load (−1.12 vs −1.09 log(10) copies/mL; treatment difference −0.02 log(10) copies/mL, 95% confidence interval: −.62, .57; P = .94), median supplemental oxygen-free days (26 vs 28 days, P = .84), incident respiratory failure (10.3 vs 10.7%, P = .98), or all-cause mortality (0 vs 7.1%, P = .19) versus placebo. Adverse events were similar between arms (presatovir 80%, placebo 79%). Resistance-associated substitutions in RSV fusion protein emerged in 6/29 presatovir-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Presatovir treatment was well tolerated in HCT patients with RSV LRTI but did not improve virologic or clinical outcomes versus placebo.

7348,Enteric Lesions and Diarrhea in Gnotobiotic Calves Monoinfected with Cryptosporidium Species,1984-11-11,"Background. Rhinoviruses frequently cause the common cold but have not been considered important causes of acute respiratory hospitalizations in children. Methods. A population-based surveillance study was performed among children <5 years of age who were hospitalized with respiratory symptoms or fever and who resided within counties encompassing Nashville, Tennessee, or Rochester, New York, from October 2000 through September 2001. Data collected included questionnaires, nasal and throat swabs for viral culture and polymerase chain reaction testing, and chart review. Rates of rhinovirus-associated hospitalizations were calculated. Results. Of 592 children enrolled, 156 (26%) were rhinovirus positive, representing 4.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.3–5.2) rhinovirus-associated hospitalizations/1000 children. Age-specific rates per 1000 children were 17.6 (95% CI, 14.9–20.6) for 0–5-month-olds, 6.0 (95% CI, 5.0–7.0) for 6–23-month-olds, and 2.0 (95% CI, 1.6, 2.4) for 24–59-month-olds (P<.01) Children with a history of wheezing/asthma had significantly more rhinovirusassociated hospitalizations than those without a history (25.3/1000 children [95% CI, 21.6–29.5/1000 children] vs. 3.1/1000 children [95% CI, 2.7–3.5/1000 children]).

7358,Chemokine CC Receptor 2 Is Important for Acute Control of Cardiac Parasitism but Does Not Contribute to Cardiac Inflammation after Infection with Trypanosoma cruzi,2006-06-01,"Aberrant activation of hedgehog (HH) pathway has been implicated in the development of human malignancies. This study aimed at investigating the role of HH molecules in human ovarian carcinogenesis. The expression profiles of HH molecules were examined in ovarian tumor samples and ovarian cancer cell lines and the in vitro effects of HH molecules on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion and cell differentiation as well as related downstream target genes were assessed. Overexpression of Patched and Gli1 protein in ovarian cancers correlated with poor survival of the patients (P = 0.008; P = 0.004). Significantly elevated expression of Sonic hedgehog messenger RNA was observed in ovarian cancers compared with normal tissues and benign ovarian tumors and such differential expression was specific to histological types (P < 0.05). Ectopic Gli1 overexpression in ovarian cancer cells conferred increased cell proliferation, cell mobility, invasiveness and change in differentiation in association with increased expression of E-cadherin, vimentin, Bcl-2, caspases as well as β1 integrin, membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Treatment with 3-keto-N-(aminoethyl-aminocaproyl-dihydrocinnamoyl)-cyclopamine induced cancer cell apoptosis, suppressed cell growth, mobility and invasiveness and induced cancer cell dedifferentiation with decreased expression of E-cadherin, cytokeratin 7, Snail, calretinin, vimentin, Bcl-2, caspases, β1 integrin, MT1-MMP and VEGF. Our data suggested that abnormal HH signaling activation plays important roles in the development and progression of ovarian cancers. Gli1 expression is an independent prognostic marker. Inhibition of the HH pathway molecules might be a valid therapeutic strategy for ovarian cancers.","Liao, Xiaoyun; Siu, Michelle K.Y.; Au, Christy W.H.; Wong, Esther S.Y.; Chan, Hoi Yan; Ip, Philip P.C.; Ngan, Hextan Y.S.; Cheung, Annie N.Y.",Carcinogenesis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109814/,73
7374,Viral Taxonomy,1993-05-11,"Cell-free protein synthesis is a useful method for preparing proteins for functional or structural analyses. However, batch-to-batch variability with regard to protein synthesis activity remains a problem for large-scale production of cell extract in the laboratory. To address this issue, we have developed a novel procedure for large-scale preparation of bacterial cell extract with high protein synthesis activity. The developed procedure comprises cell cultivation using a fermentor, harvesting and washing of cells by tangential flow filtration, cell disruption with high-pressure homogenizer and continuous diafiltration. By optimizing and combining these methods, ∼100 ml of the cell extract was prepared from 150 g of Escherichia coli cells. The protein synthesis activities, defined as the yield of protein per unit of absorbance at 260 nm of the cell extract, were shown to be reproducible, and the average activity of several batches was twice that obtained using a previously reported method. In addition, combinatorial use of the high-pressure homogenizer and diafiltration increased the scalability, indicating that the cell concentration at disruption varies from 0.04 to 1 g/ml. Furthermore, addition of Gam protein and examinations of the N-terminal sequence rendered the extract prepared here useful for rapid screening with linear DNA templates.","Katsura, Kazushige; Matsuda, Takayoshi; Tomabechi, Yuri; Yonemochi, Mayumi; Hanada, Kazuharu; Ohsawa, Noboru; Sakamoto, Kensaku; Takemoto, Chie; Shirouzu, Mikako",J Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109869/,73
7383,Deficient Responses of Pulmonary Macrophages from Healthy Smokers to Antiviral Lymphokines in Vitro,1986-10-11,"Several ATP-depending reactions take place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ER the existence of a Sac1p-dependent ATP transport system was already known, its direct involvement in ATP transport was excluded. Here we report an extensive biochemical characterization of a partially purified adenine nucleotide transport system (ANTS) not dependent on Sac1p. Highly purified ER membranes from the wild-type and Δsac1 yeast strains reconstituted into liposomes transported ATP with the same efficiency. A chromatography on hydroxyapatite was used to partially purify ANTS from Δsac1 ER extract. The two ANTS-enriched transport activity eluted fractions showed essentially the presence of four bands, one having an apparent MW of 56 kDa, similar to that observed for ANTS identified in rat liver ER. The two fractions reconstituted into liposomes efficiently transported, by a strict counter-exchange mechanism, ATP and ADP. ATP transport was saturable with a Km of 0.28 mM. The ATP/ADP exchange mechanism and the kinetic constants suggest that the main physiological role of ANTS is to catalyse the transport of ATP into ER, where it is used in several energy-requiring reactions and to export back to the cytosol the ADP produced.","Li, Yuan; Cappello, Anna Rita; Muto, Luigina; Martello, Emanuela; Madeo, Marianna; Curcio, Rosita; Lunetti, Paola; Raho, Susanna; Zaffino, Francesco; Frattaruolo, Luca; Lappano, Rosamaria; Malivindi, Rocco; Maggiolini, Marcello; Aiello, Donatella; Piazzolla, Carmela; Capobianco, Loredana; Fiermonte, Giuseppe; Dolce, Vincenza",J Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109914/,73

Among system L transporters, L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is responsible for the nutrient uptake in cancer cells, whereas L-type amino acid transporter 2 (LAT2) is a transporter for non-cancer cells. In this study, we have established HEK293 cell lines stably expressing high levels of human LAT1 and LAT2 forming heterodimers with native human 4F2hc of the cells. We have found that l-[(14)C]alanine is an appropriate substrate to examine the function of LAT2, whereas l-[(14)C]leucine is used for LAT1. By using l-[(14)C]alanine on LAT2, we have for the first time directly evaluated the function of human LAT2 expressed in mammalian cells and obtained its reliable kinetics. Using α-alkyl amino acids including α-methyl-alanine and α-ethyl-l-alanine, we have demonstrated that α-alkyl groups interfere with the interaction with LAT2. These cell lines with higher practical advantages would be useful for screening and analyzing compounds to develop LAT1-specific drugs that can be used for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. The strategy that we took to establish the cell lines would also be applicable to the other heterodimeric transporters with important therapeutic implications.","Khunweeraphong, Narakorn; Nagamori, Shushi; Wiriyasermkul, Pattama; Nishinaka, Yumiko; Wongthai, Printip; Ohgaki, Ryuichi; Tanaka, Hidekazu; Tominaga, Hideyuki; Sakurai, Hiroyuki; Kanai, Yoshikatsu",J Pharmacol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128428/,73

13327,"Phylogeny, recombination, and invasiveness of group B Streptococcus revealed by genomic comparisons of its global strains",2020-10-16,"INTRODUCTION: Severe pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB) remains a difficult-to-treat infection. Considering the poor lung penetration of most antibiotics, the choice of the better antibiotic regimen is debated. METHODS: We performed a prospective, observational, multicenter study conducted from January 2017 to June 2020. All consecutive hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia due to MDR-AB were included in the study. The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate risk factors associated with survival or death at 30 days from pneumonia onset. A propensity score for receiving therapy with fosfomycin was added to the model. RESULTS: During the study period, 180 cases of hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, caused by MDR-AB strains were observed. Cox regression analysis of factors associated with 30-day mortality, after propensity score, showed that septic shock, and secondary bacteremia were associated with death, while a fosfomycin-containing regimen was associated with 30-day survival. Antibiotic combinations with fosfomycin in definitive therapy for 44 patients were: fosfomycin + colistin in 11 (25%) patients followed by fosfomycin + carbapenem + tigecycline in 8 (18.2%), fosfomycin + colistin + tigecycline in 7 (15.9%), fosfomycin + rifampin in 7 (15.9%), fosfomycin + tigecycline in 6 (13.6%), fosfomycin + carbapenem in 3 (6.8%), and fosfomycin + aminoglycoside in 2 (4.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This real-life clinical experience concerning the therapeutic approach to severe pneumonia caused by MDR-AB provides useful suggestions to clinicians, showing the use of different antibiotic regimens with a predominant role for fosfomycin. Further randomized clinical trials are necessary to confirm or exclude these observations.","Russo, Alessandro; Bassetti, Matteo; Bellelli, Valeria; Bianchi, Luigi; Marincola Cattaneo, Federica; Mazzocchetti, Stefania; Paciacconi, Elena; Cottini, Fabrizio; Schiattarella, Arcangelo; Tufaro, Giuseppe; Sabetta, Francesco; D’Avino, Alessandro",Infect Dis Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7568458/,73

20029,"Mortality in children aged <5 years with severe acute respiratory illness in a high HIV-prevalence urban and rural areas of South Africa, 2009–2013",2021-08-12,"INTRODUCTION: The newer glucose-lowering therapies for type 2 diabetes (T2D), the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) and the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), have additional clinical benefits beyond improving glycaemic control; promoting weight loss, addressing associated cardiovascular risk factors and reducing macrovascular and microvascular complications. Considering their independent mechanisms of actions, there is a potential for significant synergy with combination therapy, yet limited data exist. This 32-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will gain mechanistic insight into the effects of coadministration of exenatide QW, a weekly subcutaneous GLP1-RA, with dapagliflozin, a once daily oral SGLT2i, on the dynamic, adaptive changes in energy balance, total, regional and organ-specific fat mass and multiorgan insulin sensitivity. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 110 obese patients with diagnosed T2D (glycated haemoglobin, HbA(1c) ≥48 mmol/mol) will be treated for 32 weeks with dapagliflozin (10 mg once daily either alone or in combination with exenatide QW (2 mg once weekly); active treatments will be compared with a control group (placebo tablet and sham injection). The primary objective of the study is to compare the adjusted mean reduction in total body fat mass (determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, DEXA) from baseline following 32 weeks of treatment with exenatide QW and dapagliflozin versus dapagliflozin alone compared with control (placebo). Secondary outcome measures include changes in (1) energy balance (energy intake and energy expenditure measured by indirect calorimetry); (2) appetite (between and within meals) and satiety quotient; (3) body composition including visceral adipose tissue, subcutaneous adipose tissue, liver and pancreatic fat. Exploratory outcome measures include metabolic changes in hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity (using a two-stage hyperinsulinaemic, euglycaemic clamp), central nervous system responses to food images using blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) and changes in cardiovascular function (using transthoracic echocardiography, cardiac MR and duplex ultrasonography). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the North West Liverpool Central Research Ethics Committee (14/NW/1147) and is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice.

21122,"Remdesivir, on the road to DisCoVeRy",2021-09-14,"BACKGROUND: Tonsillar surgery has been used for decades to treat recurrent and chronic tonsillitis in adults. Recurrent and chronic tonsillitis result in disturbing symptoms, treatment costs, sick leave, and impaired quality of life (QoL). Theoretically, removing all or part of the altered pathological palatal lymphoid tissue alleviates the symptoms and enhances the QoL. Whether this is true with total or partial tonsillar resection (tonsillectomy (TE) and tonsillotomy (TT), respectively) has not been reported in a randomised trial yet. METHODS: We conduct a multicentre, partly blinded, randomised, 6-month, parallel-group clinical study including 285 adult participants referred to surgical treatment for chronic or recurrent tonsillitis. The participants will either have TE, TT or watchful waiting (WW). The primary outcome will be the difference between the mean disease-specific Tonsillectomy Outcome Inventory-14 (QoL questionnaire) scores at 6 months. Comparison is made firstly between the combined TE+TT and WW groups (superiority analysis), and secondly between the TE and TT groups (non-inferiority analysis). DISCUSSION: This study will add significant new information to the effects and harms of TE and TT procedures in the treatment of adults with chronic or recurrent tonsillitis.

21149,Measles immunisation gaps in Africa,2021-06-23,"BACKGROUND: Optimal management of severe trauma patients with active hemorrhage relies on adequate initial resuscitation. Early administration of coagulation factors improves post-traumatic coagulation disorders, and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) might be useful in this context. Our main hypothesis is that four-factor PCC in addition to a massive transfusion protocol decreases blood product consumption at day 1 in severe trauma patients with major bleeding. METHODS: This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel, controlled superiority trial. Eligible patients are trauma patients with major bleeding admitted to a French level-I trauma center. Patients randomized in the treatment arm receive 1 mL/kg (25 IU/ml of Factor IX/Kg) four-factor PCC within 1-h post-admission while patients randomized in the controlled group receive 1 mL/kg of saline solution 0.9% as a placebo. Treatments are given as soon as possible using syringe pumps (120 mL/h). The primary endpoint is the amount of blood products transfused in the first 24 h post-admission (including red blood cells, frozen fresh plasma, and platelets). The secondary endpoints are the amount of each blood product transfused in the first 24 h, time to achieve prothrombin time ratio < 1.5, time to hemostasis, number of thrombo-embolic events at 28 days, mortality at 24 h and 28 days, number of intensive care unit-free days, number of ventilator-free days, number of hospital-free days within the first 28 days, hospitalization status at day 28, Glasgow outcome scale extended for patients with brain lesions on initial cerebral imaging, and cost of each strategy at days 8 and 28. Inclusions have started in December 2017 and are expected to be complete by June 2021. DISCUSSION: If PCC reduces total blood consumption at day 1 after severe trauma, this therapy, in adjunction to a classic massive transfusion protocol, may be used empirically on admission in patients at risk of massive transfusion to enhance coagulation. Moreover, this treatment may decrease blood product-related complications and may improve clinical outcomes after post-traumatic hemorrhage. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03218722.

22189,Travel Medicine: Tales Behind the Science,2008-04-11,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Huanglian-Houpo decoction (HH), which is recorded in the famous traditional Chinese medicine monograph “Puji Fang,” contains two individual herbs, Huanglian (Rhizoma coptidis) and Houpo (Magnoliae officinalis cortex). It was regularly used to treat seasonal epidemic colds and influenzas in ancient China. Our laboratory discovered that HH has a significant anti-H1N1 influenza virus effect. However, no pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data concerning the anti-H1N1 influenza virus activity of HH are available to date. In the current study, the concentration-time profiles of two major components of HH, berberine and magnolol, in rat plasma were investigated. METHODS: An integrate pharmacokinetic approach was developed for evaluating the holistic pharmacokinetic characteristics of berberine and magnolol from HH. Additionally, the inhibition rate and levels of IFN-β in MDCK cells infected by influenza virus were analyzed. Data were calculated using 3p97 with pharmacokinetic analysis. RESULTS: The estimated pharmacokinetic parameters were maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) 0.9086 μg/ml, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) 347.74 μg·min/ml, and time to reach C(max) (T(max)) 64.69 min for berberine and C(max) = 0.9843 μg/ml, AUC= 450.64 μg·min/ml, T(max) = 56.86 min for magnolol, respectively. Furthermore, integrated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis showed that the highest plasma concentration, inhibition rate and interferon-β (IFN-β) secretion of HH first increased and then weakened over time, reaching their peaks at 60 min. The plasma concentration of HH is directly related to the anti-influenza virus effect. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that berberine and magnolol are the main active ingredients of HH related to its anti-influenza virus effect, which is related to the improvement of IFN-β secretion.","Zhang, Feng-ling; Yin, Xiao-jie; Yan, Yun-liang; Wu, Qiao-feng",Eur J Drug Metab Pharmacokinet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8505218/,73
22203,"Contagion and Chaos: Disease, Ecology, and National Security in the Era of Globalization",2009-11-11,"Temperature is one of the major environmental factors that people are exposed to on a daily basis, often in conditions that do not afford control. It is known that heat and cold can influence a person’s productivity and performance in simple tasks. With respect to social cognition, it has also been suggested that temperature impacts on relatively high-level forms of decision-making. For instance, previous research demonstrated that cold temperature promotes utilitarian judgment in a moral dilemma task. This effect could be due to psychological processing, when a cool temperature primes a set of internal representations (associated with “coldness”). Alternatively, the promotion of utilitarian judgment in cold conditions could be due to physiological interference from temperature, impeding on social cognition. Refuting both explanations of psychological or physiological processing, however, it has been suggested that there may be problems of reproducibility in the literature on temperature modulating complex or abstract information processing. To examine the role of temperature in moral decision-making, we conducted a series of experiments using ambient and haptic temperature with careful manipulation checks and modified task methodology. Experiment 1 manipulated room temperature with cool (21°C), control (24°C) and hot (27°C) conditions and found only a cool temperature effect, promoting utilitarian judgment as in the previous study. Experiment 2 manipulated the intensity of haptic temperature but failed to obtain the cool temperature effect. Experiments 3 and 4 examined the generalizability of the cool ambient temperature effect with another moral judgment task and with manipulation of exposure duration. However, again there were no cool temperature effects, suggesting a lack of reproducibility. Despite successful manipulations of temperature in all four experiments, as measured in body temperature and the participants’ self-reported perception, we found no systematic influence of temperature on moral decision-making. A Bayesian meta-analysis of the four experiments showed that the overall data tended to provide strong support in favor of the null hypothesis. We propose that, at least in the range of temperatures from 21 to 27°C, the cool temperature effect in moral decision-making is not a robust phenomenon.","Sudo, Ryunosuke; Nakashima, Satoshi F.; Ukezono, Masatoshi; Takano, Yuji; Lauwereyns, Johan",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8506165/,73

In this context, new concepts such as digital connectivity, interconnection, and interoperability emerged as highly disruptive approaches for logistics systems and supply chain management (SCM). To shed more light on these complexities and see how companies organized in a SCM model can adopt, implement and operate in a digital connectivity model, this study proposes a framework, namely SIMPLE. To develop the framework, we employed a literature review approach, focusing on recent studies published in journals. After the literature analysis, six dimensions related to digital connectivity in supply chains and logistics emerged, namely Smart, Innovative, Measurable, Profitable, Lean, and Excellence (SIMPLE). This framework brings opportunities for future studies, while providing important insights into the dynamics of digital connectivity in logistics and supply chains. Therefore, these SIMPLE framework dimensions should enable the actors involved in organizations’ operations to interact adequately and harmoniously so as to maximize the value generated in the network.","Queiroz, Maciel M.; Fosso Wamba, Samuel","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134284/,73

38528,The Concept of the Crown and Its Potential Role in the Downfall of Coronavirus,2020-09-11,"If the current rate of infection are to be better managed, and future waves of infection kept at bay, it is absolutely necessary that the conditions and mechanisms of exposure to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) be better understood, as well as the downstream severe or lethal clinical complications. While the identification of notable comorbidities has now helped to define broad risk groups, the idiosyncratic responses of individual patients can generate unexpected clinical deterioration that is difficult to predict from initial clinical features. Thus, physicians caring for patients with COVID-19 face clinical dilemmas on a daily basis. The ability to decipher individual predispositions to SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe illness, in light of variations in host immunological and inflammatory responses, in particular as a result of genetic variations, would be of great benefit in infection management. To this end, this work associates the description of COVID-19 clinical complications, comorbidities, sequelae, and environmental and genetic factors. We also give examples of underlying genomic susceptibility to COVID-19, especially with regard to the newly reported link between the disease and the unbalanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. As a consequence, we propose that the host/genetic factors associated with COVID-19 call for precision medicine in its treatment.

The oral uptake of sporulated oocysts and/or consumption of undercooked/raw meat of animals infected with Toxoplasma gondii can infect other animals and humans. Heart, liver, and meat tissues of 150 sheep and 150 goats from a slaughterhouse in Ahvaz, Iran, were collected during autumn 2018 and analyzed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect parasitic DNA in the animal tissues. Moreover, antibodies against T. gondii of 150 sera samples were detected as the targets by in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (in-house ELISA). A total of 26 (17.3%), 33 (22%), and 48 (32%) of liver, meat, and heart samples in sheep, and a total of 24 (16%), 26 (17.3%), and 36 (24%) of liver, meat, and heart samples in goats, respectively, showed positive PCR results. Besides, the ELISA evaluation of sera samples from 150 sheep and 150 goats resulted in 26 (13.3%) and 16 (10.6%) positive cases, respectively. A significant difference was also found between PCR-positive heart samples and ELISA-positive sera samples of both animal species (p < 0.05), but no significant difference existed between PCR-positive liver samples and ELISA-positive sera samples of both species (p > 0.05).

Repeat SARS-COV2 PCR testing,2020-12-31,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Addiction scientists have begun using ambulatory assessment methods—including ecological momentary assessment (EMA), experience sampling, and daily diaries—to collect real-time or near-real-time reports of participants’ internal states in their natural environments. The goal of this short review is to synthesize EMA findings from our research group, which has studied several hundred outpatients during treatment for opioid-use disorder (OUD). (We cite pertinent findings from other groups, but have not tried to be comprehensive.) One of our main goals in using EMA is to examine momentary changes in internal states that proximally predict, or concurrently mark, events such as lapses to opioid use. RECENT FINDINGS: We summarize findings evaluating several classes of momentary markers or predictors (craving, stress, negative and positive moods, and physical pain/discomfort) of lapses and other states/behaviors. Craving and some negatively valenced mood states are concurrently and prospectively associated with lapses to opioid use during treatment. Craving is also concurrently and prospectively associated with momentary changes in stress and mood. Convincing evidence has not yet emerged for stress as a robust redictor of lapse to opioid use; it appears to be contributory, but neither necessary nor sufficient. SUMMARY: Ambulatory assessment can capture changes in internal states and drug-related behaviors in situ and at high temporal resolution. We recommend research strategies that may increase the clinical and prognostic utility of ambulatory assessment, including denser sampling (i.e., more assessments per day) and more attention to heterogeneity across people and across populations.","Burgess-Hull, Albert; Epstein, David H.",Curr Addict Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7778403/,73

India has developed more engineering programs that dwell on mathematical analysis, theory and an understanding of the science rather than engineering technology programs which focus on application of science to solve real-world problems. Industries rely on innovation which is all about making incremental modifications to existing solutions with the intention of adding value or improving the efficiency. Thus there is a fundamental disconnect in the expectation of industry from graduating students and the focus of engineering programs.

Semiconducting proprieties of obtained deposits were investigated by Mott-Schottky measurements whereas the optical ones were performed by UV–Visible spectrophotometry. The morphological characterization was carried out using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The obtained results showed that the electrodeposition process of selenium films in citrate bath occurred under diffusional regime as rate-limiting step. Deposition rate of selenium layers on platinum substrate is much superior than in the case of ITO substrate and up to a value of 0.65 μg/cm(2) s. The HSeO(3)(−)/Se system becomes more rapid with the increase of the bath temperature. Obtained deposits are photoactive films that belong to p-type semiconductors with number of charge carriers in order of 10(21)/cm(3) and energy band gap about 1.7 eV.

RESULTS: PVE in dogs and FPL in cats had the highest prevalence compared to other diseases (34.1%; 95% confidence interval: 24.3–44.9; N = 88 and 20.2%; 95% confidence interval: 13.6–28.1; N = 129, respectively). Young age (43.8%), poor body condition (58.4%), and exotic breeds (44.2%) were significantly associated with the occurrence of PVE (p ≤ 0.05). Poor body condition (27.8%) and non-vaccination status (26.7%) were associated with FPL (p ≤ 0.05). Both PVE and FPL showed clinical signs of being off-feed, frequent vomiting, weakness, and moderate dehydration. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of PVE and FPL indicates that they are common in dogs and cats in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The factors related to PVE are young age, exotic breed, and poor body condition score (BCS), and FPL are poor BCS and non-vaccination. Specific measures such as care during younger age, good nutrition, and routine vaccination are needed to prevent and control PVE and FPL in Dhaka’s dog and cat population.","Chisty, Nurun Nahar; Belgrad, Joseph P.; Al Sattar, Abdullah; Akter, Sazeda; Hoque, Md.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA and Antibodies among People Experiencing Homelessness and Staying in Shelters or Outdoor Encampments in Denver, Colorado, May-July 2020",2020-12-31,"Will nationalism thrive in times of crisis? A broad segment of scholarly literature has found that a crisis often leads to the resurgence of nationalism. When the coronavirus started to spread rapidly in Europe, individual European nation states unilaterally closed their borders, hoarded critical medical supplies, and played blame games. The early period of the pandemic crisis revealed some hybrid form of medical nationalism, economic nationalism, and everyday nationalism. However, the common crisis has also heightened the importance of regional solidarity, and reinforces a strengthening of cross-national cooperation and multilateral institutions. Based on empirical discussions, this research offers an analytical framework to establish the hypothetic mechanisms of understanding this mixed phenomenon. Delving into the interaction between crisis and nationalism, this article argues that the causation from one to the other is not a linear, one-way process. There are competing mechanisms through which both nationalists and liberalists can use the crisis to push for their political agenda. Whether there will be a new wave of neo-nationalism in Europe is largely contingent on the responses the EU and the member states adopt in handling domestic and regional challenges in the post-pandemic era. Therefore, instead of simply exploring the causal relation between crisis and nationalism, more-nuanced questions can be examined in the future concerning the conditions under which and the mechanisms through which a crisis is more/less likely to provoke neo-nationalism.","Wang, Zhongyuan",Chin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7781420/,73

Clinical Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 Among Confirmed and Suspected Cases in Tennessee,2020-12-31,"JUSTIFICATION: With the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant school closure, children all over the country are undergoing a lot of educational, psychosocial, and physical problems. There is an urgent and deep felt need to offer scientific and concrete guidance for these concerns and support children in their educational development during these testing times. OBJECTIVES: To review the guidelines and recommendations given by various international agencies and formulate guidelines in the Indian context on (a) how and when to reopen the schools; (b) ways and means of remote learning; and (c) to identify the contents of curriculum that need restructuring in context of the current situation. PROCESS: Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) formed a task force of pediatricians, educationists and technological experts who connected through various video and social platforms. They gathered and exchanged information and thoughts. The writing committee drafted the guidelines and got approval of all the members of the task force. RECOMMENDATIONS: Schools can be reopened only when the local epidemiological parameters are favorable, the administration is equipped with adequate infrastructure and health care facilities, and the stakeholders (teachers, students, parents, and support staff) are prepared for the new normal. In the meanwhile, remote learning (media-based and /or otherwise) should reach to the last student to maintain uninterrupted education. The curriculum needs to be revised, with focus on revision and core contents. Informal learning of psychosocial empowerment and daily living skills should be encouraged rather than stressful formal learning.","Ghate, Swati; Parekh, Bakul Jayant; Thapar, Rajeev Kumar; Nadkarni, P.

Epidemiology of Antimicrobial Use Among SARS-CoV-2 Positive and Negative Admissions in the US: A Multicenter Evaluation,2020-12-31,"Social media platforms have been vested with hope for their potential to enable ‘ordinary citizens’ to make their judgments public and contribute to pluralized discussions about organizations and their perceived legitimacy (Etter et al. in Bus Soc 57(1):60–97, 2018). This raises questions about how ordinary citizens make judgements and voice them in online spaces. This paper addresses these questions by examining how Western citizens ascribe responsibility and action in relation to corporate misconduct. Empirically, it focuses on modern slavery and analyses online debates in Denmark on child slavery in the cocoa industry. Conceptually, it introduces the notion of cosmopolitanism as a general disposition of care and responsibility towards distant others, conceived as a prerequisite for the critical evaluation of corporate (ir)responsibility in the Global South. The analysis of online debates shows that citizens debate child slavery in terms of individual consumer responsibility rather than corporate responsibility. Corporations are not considered potential agents of change. As a consequence, online citizen debates did not reflect a legitimacy crisis for the cocoa industry, as debates over responsibility were overwhelmingly concerned with the agency of the Western individual, the individual agency of the speakers themselves. Participants in debates understood their agency strictly as consumer agency.","Vestergaard, Anne; Uldam, Julie",J Bus Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7782051/,73

Kawasaki’s Disease and Sars-Cov-2: an Unexpected Pediatric Global Crisis?,2020-12-31,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Knowledge of ventilator waveforms is important for clinicians working with children requiring mechanical ventilation. This review covers the basics of how to interpret and use data from ventilator waveforms in the pediatric intensive care unit. RECENT FINDINGS: Patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) is a common finding in pediatric patients and observed in approximately one-third of ventilator breaths. PVA is associated with worse outcomes including increased length of mechanical ventilation, increased length of stay, and increased mortality. Identification of PVA is possible with a thorough knowledge of ventilator waveforms. SUMMARY: Ventilator waveforms are graphical descriptions of how a breath is delivered to a patient. These include three scalars (flow versus time, volume versus time, and pressure versus time) and two loops (pressure-volume and flow-volume). Thorough understanding of both scalars and loops, and their characteristic appearances, is essential to being able to evaluate a patient’s respiratory mechanics and interaction with the ventilator.","Emrath, Elizabeth",Curr Pediatr Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7782574/,73

Sensitivity Results for the Abbott m2000 PCR Assay of SARS-CoV-2 at a Denver, Colorado Medical Center",2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It was highly contagious spreading all over the world, with a rapid increase in the number of deaths. The reported cases have reached more than 14 million with more than 600,000 deaths around the world. So, the pandemic of COVID-19 became a surpassing healthcare crisis with an intensive load on the healthcare resources. In this study, the aim was to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from its mimickers as atypical infection, interstitial lung diseases, and eosinophilic lung diseases based on CT, clinical, and laboratory findings. RESULTS: This retrospective study included 260 patients, of which 220 were confirmed as COVID-19 positive by two repeated RT-PCR test and 40 were classified as non-COVID by two repeated negative RT-PCR test or identification of other pathogens, other relevant histories, or clinical findings. In this study, 158 patients were male (60.7 %) and 102 patients were female (39.3%). There was 60.9% of the COVID-19 group were male and 39.1% were female. Patients in the non-COVID group were significantly older (the mean age was 46.4) than those in the confirmed COVID-19 group (35.2y). In the COVID-19 group, there was exposure history to positive cases in 84.1% while positive exposure history was 20% in the non-COVID group. CONCLUSION: The spectrum of CT imaging findings in COVID-19 pneumonia is wide that could be contributed by many other diseases making the interpretation of chest CTs nowadays challenging to differentiate between different diseases having the same signs and act as deceiving simulators in the era of COVID-19.","Motawea, Abdelghany Mohammed; Omar, Suzan; Yasin, Rabab",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7783496/,73
44036,LB-19. Association between contract staffing and reported outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in a cluster-randomized trial of 965 U.S. nursing homes,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has caused a global pandemic. Critically ill patients with COVID-19 can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and thrombosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 to gain entry in cells. This receptor is widely expressed in some hematopoietic cells, including monocytes and macrophages. Infection of these cells results in secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 and other inflammatory cytokines. IL-6 and other inflammatory cytokines can cause ARDS and thrombosis. Elevated IL-6 levels are expected to cause more severe cytokine release syndrome. In this study we investigated the association of the predictive risk scores with the IL-6 level, duration of oxygen therapy (DOT), and D-dimer level. METHODS: We enrolled 20 consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from April 3, 2020, to April 30, 2020, and determined the predictive risk scores of CALL points (Dong J et al. CID 2020) and COVID-GRAM (Liang W et al. JAMA Int. Med2020) on admission. We statically analyzed the regressions between these two scores and the values of IL-6 and D-dimer and DOT. RESULTS: The regression lines between CALL points and the values of IL-6, D-dimer, DOT were Y=-2.09 + 0.618X (r=0.821), Y=-0.783 + 0.213X (r=0.510), and Y=-5.32 + 1.26X (r=0.744), respectively. The regression lines between COVID-GRAM and the values of IL-6, D-dimer, and DOT were Y=-0.820 + 0.0344X (r=0.935), Y=-2.70 + 0.0205X (r=0.774), and Y=-1.92 + 0.0491X (r=0.765), respectively. These correlation coefficients were statistically significant. The correlation coefficients of CALL points were in the descending order of IL-6, DOT, and D-dimer. The correlation coefficients of COVID-GRAM were in the descending order of IL-6, D-dimer, and DOT. The coefficient between COVID-GRAM and IL-6 was the highest. CONCLUSION: These predictive risk scores of CALL points and COVID-GRAM can be surrogate markers for the IL-6 level in patients with COVID-19. Further research is required to understand the prediction of severity in patients with COVID-19.

Clinical features and outcomes of 112 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections requiring intensive care in a public healthcare system in South Florida,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted outpatient pediatric antibiotic prescribing. METHODS: We compared diagnoses and antibiotic prescription rates for children pre- vs post-COVID-19 in 5 ambulatory settings affiliated with Vanderbilt University Medical Center: emergency department (ED), urgent care clinics (including pediatric-only after-hours clinics [AHC]s and walk-in clinics [WIC] for all ages), primary care clinics (PCC), and retail health clinics (RHC). Time periods were pre-COVID-19 3/1/19 – 5/15/19 (P1); and post-COVID-19 3/1/20 – 5/15/20 (P2). Diagnoses and percent of encounters with an antibiotic prescription were analyzed by encounter (in-person vs telemedicine [TMed]), clinic and provider type. We also interviewed 16 providers about perceived COVID-19 impact on pediatric ambulatory antibiotic prescribing. Student’s T and χ (2) tests were used as appropriate. RESULTS: The number of pediatric ambulatory visits was 16671 in P1 and 7010 in P2. There were no TMed visits in P1 vs 188 in P2 (2.7% of total P2 visits); 186 (99% of TMed visits) were in PCC (Table). In all settings, the number of encounters was lower in P2 vs P1 (p< 0.001). The percent of encounters with an antibiotic prescription was lower in P2 (32%) than in P1 (38.2%) (p< 0.001) (Table) overall and in all settings except RHCs. Only 14 (7.4%) TMed visits resulted in an antibiotic prescription. There were no differences in antibiotic prescribing rates by provider type. Diagnoses varied significantly between periods in all clinic types except the ED, with noninfectious diagnoses being higher in P2 vs P1 (Figure 1). Providers felt that COVID-19 led to fewer but sicker patients presenting for care, and variable impact on antibiotic prescribing (Figure 2). Table.

Outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 among Migrant Farm Workers in North Florida,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Although majority of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases demonstrate mild to asymptomatic disease, COVID-19 can cause serious complications and death. However, risk factors for development of such complications are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for intubation, cardiac arrest, and death in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of COVID-19 subjects was conducted of the first 185 patients for whom we had complete data sets. Subjects were adult inpatients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis who were hospitalized between March and May 2020 at Vidant Medical Center in Greenville, NC. Data including demographics, comorbidities, laboratory results, treatments, and outcomes were collected. Data were analyzed using logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic curves in SAS 9.4. RESULTS: Of the first 185 subjects hospitalized for COVID-19, 26% of patients were intubated, 9% experienced cardiac arrest, and 17% died. Subjects who required intubation were more likely to exhibit elevated triglycerides, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), elevated troponin levels, altered mental status, leukocytosis, lymphopenia and elevated ferritin (P< 0.05) (Table 1). Troponin elevation, ARDS, AKI and thrombocytopenia were risks for cardiac arrest (P< 0.05) (Table 2). Risk of death was increased in those presenting with advanced age, critical or severe disease, lymphopenia or thrombocytopenia, and in those with history of coronary artery disease (CAD) (P< 0.05) (Table 3). Patients presenting with AKI, elevated Troponin, ARDS, pressor requirements, critical disease, and sepsis were at increased risk of intubation, cardiac arrest, and death (P< 0.05) (Tables 1–3).

The first human study with this technique demonstrated delivery of naltrexone (an opioid antagonist) for two to three days. Rapid micropore closure, however, blunts the delivery window. Application of diclofenac (an anti-inflammatory) allows seven days of naltrexone delivery in animals. The purpose of the current work was to demonstrate delivery of naltrexone for seven days following one microneedle treatment in humans. METHODS Human subjects were treated with microneedles, diclofenac (or placebo), and naltrexone. Impedance measurements were used as a surrogate marker to measure micropore formation, and plasma naltrexone concentrations were measured for seven days post-microneedle application. RESULTS Impedance dropped significantly from baseline to post-microneedle treatment, confirming micropore formation. Naltrexone was detected for seven days in Group 1 (diclofenac + naltrexone, n = 6), vs. 72 h in Group 2 (placebo + naltrexone, n = 2). At study completion, a significant difference in impedance was observed between intact and microneedle-treated skin in Group 1 (confirming the presence of micropores). CONCLUSION This is the first study demonstrating week-long drug delivery after one microneedle application, which would increase patient compliance and allow delivery of therapies for chronic diseases.","Brogden, Nicole K; Banks, Stan L; Crofford, Leslie J; Stinchcomb, Audra L",Pharmaceutical research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11095-013-1036-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23761054/,73

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses allow sensitive detection of viral nucleic acids, but it is not clear to what extent specific viruses contribute to disease because many viruses have been detected in asymptomatic children. Better understanding of how to interpret viral findings is important to reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics. OBJECTIVE To compare viral qPCR findings from children with ARI versus asymptomatic control subjects. METHODS Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children aged ≤5 years with ARI and from individually matched, asymptomatic, population-based control subjects during a noninfluenza season. Samples were analyzed by using qPCR for 16 viruses. RESULTS Respiratory viruses were detected in 72.3% of the case patients (n = 151) and 35.4% of the control subjects (n = 74) (P = .001). Rhinovirus was the most common finding in both case patients and control subjects (47.9% and 21.5%, respectively), with a population-attributable proportion of 0.39 (95% confidence interval: 0.01 to 0.62). Metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus were highly overrepresented in case patients. Bocavirus was associated with ARI even after adjustment for coinfections with other viruses and was associated with severe disease. Enterovirus and coronavirus were equally common in case patients and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS qPCR detection of respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, or parainfluenza viruses in children with ARI is likely to be causative of disease; detection of several other respiratory viruses must be interpreted with caution due to high detection rates in asymptomatic children.","Rhedin, Samuel; Lindstrand, Ann; Rotzén-Östlund, Maria; Tolfvenstam, Thomas; Ohrmalm, Lars; Rinder, Malin Ryd; Zweygberg-Wirgart, Benita; Ortqvist, Ake; Henriques-Normark, Birgitta; Broliden, Kristina; Naucler, Pontus",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2013-3042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24567027/,73

However, with increased plastic materials production, comes increased plastic material wastage creating a number of challenges, as well as opportunities to the waste management industry. The present overview highlights the waste management and pollution challenges, emphasising on the various chemical substances (known as ""additives"") contained in all plastic products for enhancing polymer properties and prolonging their life. Despite how useful these additives are in the functionality of polymer products, their potential to contaminate soil, air, water and food is widely documented in literature and described herein. These additives can potentially migrate and undesirably lead to human exposure via e.g. food contact materials, such as packaging. They can, also, be released from plastics during the various recycling and recovery processes and from the products produced from recyclates.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationships among combined tissue thickness, tissue compression, closed staple limb length, and mechanical strength of an anastomosis created with a circular stapler, as measured by maximum intraluminal pressure obtained at the time of leakage. METHODS Using 27 porcine stomachs and 27 porcine small-intestine segments, we measured tissue thickness and assessed the tissue compression at three different anvil closure distances created by a circular stapling device. Maximum intraluminal pressure was determined by infusing colored water into the porcine materials and increasing the pressure until leakage from the anastomosis occurred. RESULTS Tissue compression increased as the closure distance narrowed between the anvil and circular stapler (p < .0001). A tissue compression of ≥6 PSI correlated strongly with a maximum intraluminal pressure of ≥18 mmHg (43% for <6 PSI vs. 90% for ≥6 PSI; p = .02); tissue compression ≥12 PSI was necessary to obtain an acute maximum intraluminal pressure of ≥22 mmHg in 13 of 15 of our samples (p = .04). CONCLUSIONS Maximum intraluminal pressure of an anastomosis in this porcine model correlated most strongly with the compression of the tissue involved in the anastomosis. This experimental model provides a framework for constructing a systematic approach to creating an anastomosis with sufficient mechanical strength. However, this study was not intended to establish the upper range of tissue compression beyond which a permanent tissue injury may occur.","Myers, Stephan R; Rothermel, William S; Shaffer, Lynn",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1667-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21487874/,73

Single-incision laparoscopic surgery ileocecal resection was performed using an organ retractor. A 3-cm incision was placed in the umbilicus, and three conventional ports were inserted. An organ retractor was used for hepatocolic ligament resection, resection of the ileocolic vessels, and resection of the insertion of the mesentery proper. For each resection, the trailer line's tension was adjusted to provide a good operative view. The patient's postoperative course was good, and she was discharged 7days after surgery. DISCUSSION An organ retractor was effective for single-incision laparoscopic surgery technique not only to maintain a good operative view, but also to change trailer line tension, which enabled safe dissection. CONCLUSION An organ retractor could facilitate single-incision laparoscopic surgery.","Tominaga, Tetsuro; Nonaka, Takashi; Wakata, Kouki; Kunizaki, Masaki; Tobinaga, Shuichi; Sumida, Yorihisa; Hidaka, Shigekazu; Sawai, Terumitsu; Nagayasu, Takeshi",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2017.02.046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28285210/,73

The Checklist was developed by the National Microbiology Laboratory of Canada in collaboration with provincial/territorial, national and international laboratory experts, including the Canadian Public Health Laboratory Network, and the Global Health Security Action Group Laboratory Network. While the Checklist was initially designed to reflect lessons learned through National Microbiology Laboratory participation in extended national and international outbreak responses (e.g. Zika virus epidemic [2015-2016], Ebola virus epidemic, West Africa [2014-2016]), the importance of optimizing laboratory response coordination has only been underscored by the ongoing challenges presented by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic response requirements. The Checklist identifies five highly interdependent laboratory response themes, each of which encompasses multiple considerations that may be critical to a coordinated, strategic outbreak response. As such, the comprehensive review of Checklist considerations by responding laboratory organizations may provide a valuable opportunity to quickly detect key response considerations and interdependencies, and mitigate risks with the potential to impact public health action.","Tipples, Graham; Kuschak, Theodore; Gilmour, Matthew",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,https://doi.org/10.14745/ccdr.v46i10a01; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33316001/,73

This qualitative phenomenological research study's intent was to explore the impact of clinical experience in a community-based free-standing hospice facility as an effective pedagogical strategy for preparing student nurses to care for patients and families at the end of life (EOL). The researchers used descriptive phenomenology rooted in Husserl's philosophy. The qualitative data source included semistructured individual interviews. Convenience sampling yielded 10 senior-level nursing students in a community health nursing course. The analysis yielded 6 major themes: (1) fear of witnessing death, (2) contrasting care priorities in a hospice-dedicated versus acute care setting, (3) value of storytelling from hospice team members, (4) unprepared for EOL conversations, (5) guidance and support, and (6) benefit of hospice-dedicated experiential learning. The findings of this study support the use of expert hospice team members to guide and mentor students. Didactic and video-enhanced education, storytelling, preparation in EOL conversations, and experiential learning seem essential to familiarize students with EOL care and improve perceptions about caring for patients and their families.","Dorney, Paulette; Pierangeli, Lori",Journal of hospice and palliative nursing : JHPN : the official journal of the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/njh.0000000000000730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33417385/,73

Occurrences of opportunistic infection, however, highlight the need for novel drugs that modulate more restricted subsets of T cells. In this context, chemokines and their receptors are attractive therapeutic targets. CXCR3, a Th1-associated chemokine receptor, is preferentially expressed on T cells that accumulate in MS lesions and central nervous system (CNS) infiltrates of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Surprisingly, mice genetically deficient in either CXCR3 or CXCL10 succumb to EAE following active immunization with myelin antigens. EAE is mediated by a heterogeneous population of T cells in myelin-immunized mice. Hence, disease might develop in the absence of CXCR3 secondary to the compensatory action of encephalitogenic CCR6(+) Th17 cells. However, in the current study, we show for the first time that blockade or genetic deficiency of either CXCR3 or of its primary ligand has no impact on clinical EAE induced by the adoptive transfer of highly polarized Th1 effector cells. Our data illustrate the fact that, although highly targeted immunotherapies might have more favorable side effect profiles, they are also more likely to be rendered ineffective by inherent redundancies in chemokine and cytokine networks that arise at sites of neuroinflammation.","Lalor, Stephen J; Segal, Benjamin M",European journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.201343499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23873018/,73

SCAD has been mostly studied in the West, with little recognition in Asia leading to under-diagnosis and under-representation. In this review, we highlight two distinct cases occurring at our center in Singapore, affecting two Singaporean women of Malay and Chinese descent. These 2 cases highlight that pregnancy-associated SCAD is neither the most common nor only manifestation of SCAD. Through review of the literature, we emphasize the heterogeneity in case presentation paying particular attention to SCAD and its association with connective tissue disorders such as fibromuscular dysplasia. SCAD remains a diagnostic challenge for many cardiologists, here we shed light and dispel myths surrounding coronary angiography and review the use of intracoronary imaging. The successful treatment of this unique group of patients requires a high index of suspicion, and management within a multidisciplinary team. The development of a recovery program with access to support groups, allied health, and cardiac rehabilitation is paramount in improving outcomes for these patients in the long term. Further research and studies in our Asian population will help to enhance our understanding of this disease and develop practices to best manage our patients.","Low, Ting-Ting; Houdmont, Marie; Sim, Hui W; Chan, Koo H; Loh, Poay H; Loh, Joshua P",Clinical cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.23484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079391/,73

PURPOSE The purposes were to explore the extent to which nurses use nursing policies and protocols to guide their routine practice, and identify barriers and facilitators affecting the frequency with which nurses use nursing policies and protocols. METHODS Licensed nurses (N = 235) providing direct care to inpatients and outpatients in a large medical center participated in an 18-question online survey. RESULTS Most nurses access policies and protocols once a month or more; the greatest barrier to more frequent access was length of the policy or protocol.

Increasingly public policy to manage epidemics focuses on motivating people, through social distancing policies, to alter their behavior to reduce contacts and reduce public disease risk. Person-to-person contacts drive human disease dynamics. People value such contacts and are willing to accept some disease risk to gain contact-related benefits. The cost-benefit trade-offs that shape contact behavior, and hence the course of epidemics, are often only implicitly incorporated in epidemiological models. This approach creates difficulty in parsing out the effects of adaptive behavior. We use an epidemiological-economic model of disease dynamics to explicitly model the trade-offs that drive person-to-person contact decisions. Results indicate that including adaptive human behavior significantly changes the predicted course of epidemics and that this inclusion has implications for parameter estimation and interpretation and for the development of social distancing policies. Acknowledging adaptive behavior requires a shift in thinking about epidemiological processes and parameters.","Fenichel, Eli P; Castillo-Chavez, Carlos; Ceddia, M G; Chowell, Gerardo; Parra, Paula A Gonzalez; Hickling, Graham J; Holloway, Garth; Horan, Richard; Morin, Benjamin; Perrings, Charles; Springborn, Michael; Velazquez, Leticia; Villalobos, Cristina",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1011250108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21444809/,73

Immunocompromised patients are within the high-risk group to severe outcomes from COVID-19. However, there is no clear evidence of the association between impaired immune host status and complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection so far. The virus is transmitted by inhalation or direct contact with infected secretions, and therefore the dental office is a highly susceptible environment for such transmission. Here, we review the literature and discuss immunological COVID-19 related issues. We also make suggestions for immunocompromised patients' support in this new emerging context of clinical dental practice. Until comprehensive findings are published, individuals with impaired immunity should be considered as high-risk. Cross infection control procedures for the clinical care of immunocompromised patients should follow the same guidelines that are being proposed for immunocompetent ones. However, during the active outbreak, people under immunosuppressive conditions should not receive elective procedures, even if they do not have symptoms or exposure history to COVID-19, and in case of emergence, care must be done in a separate airborne room. In the pos-pandemic phase, the dental care general recommendations should be the same for all subjects. Changes in the current guidelines have been proposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection control in order to provide the best and safe dental practice. However, they still need to be validated by future studies.","Martins-Chaves, Roberta Rayra; Gomes, Carolina Cavaliéri; Gomez, Ricardo Santiago",Brazilian oral research,https://doi.org/10.1590/1807-3107bor-2020.vol34.0048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32428085/,73

As this is one of the first empirical studies on the COVID-19 food security nexus, we found that the raging pandemic has affected the food security pillars (availability, accessibility, utilization, and stability) in both rural and urban areas, within and outside the cordon sanitaire. The steepest decline was observed among respondents who live inside the cordon sanitaire, where rural producers and urban inhabitants without access to allotment gardens were hit hard. Increased food prices, disruptions in food logistics, and inability to work due to movement restrictions were most frequently indicated as reasons for the decline. Access to allotment gardens effectively supported households in mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the food crisis.","Houessou, Mawuna Donald Cassee Annemijn Sonneveld Ben G. J.

The current study applied a socioecological approach to the Health Belief model to understand associations among perceived risk, optimistic bias (a perceived lower risk relative to similar others), united action (perceived community capacity for collective action), and COVID-19 behavioral prevention strategies among COVID-19-negative adult cisgender SMM. Participants (n = 859), recruited via a geo-location-based dating application in May 2020, completed an online survey. Results indicated significant interactions between perceived risk and optimistic bias on social distancing (B = -.03, p &lt; .05), and between perceived risk and united action on number of preventive precautions (B = -.01, p &lt; .01) and number of casual sex partners (B = -.02, p &lt; .05). At low and average levels of perceived risk, socioecological constructs were positively associated with behavioral prevention strategies. At average levels of perceived risk and above, united action was negatively associated with number of casual sex partners, demonstrating evidence of the interaction between perception of interpersonal and community factors and perceptions of one's own risk.

In certain situations, it is also possible that people may choose to engage in health behaviors to prevent others in their community from certain health conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a unique circumstance to understand the latter, since early efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus relied on individuals complying with behavioral prevention strategies (e.g., social distancing, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds). The question of how personal beliefs are associated with engaging in behavioral prevention strategies is particularly important to understand in a certain population, sexual minority men, due to evidence that this population may be at an increased risk of COVID-19 and its related distress. We found that three COVID-19 behavioral prevention strategies (i.e., social distancing, number of COVID-19 preventive precautions, and number of casual sex partners) were shaped by an interaction of three kinds of beliefs: (a) personal beliefs about one's own risk, (b) beliefs about similar others in one's interpersonal group and, (c) beliefs about the ability of one's community to take action. These findings may help to inform how public health efforts can be mobilized to increase engagement in COVID-19 behavioral prevention strategies among sexual minority men.

Amount and types of infiltrating leukocytes in the jejunum and activity and cellular constituents of mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow were determined. PV and CoV infections were confirmed by immunohistologic demonstration of PV and CoV antigen, ultrastructural demonstration of viral particles in the intestinal content, and in situ hybridization for PV genome. FeLV infection was detected by immunohistology for gp70, p27, and p15E. Latent FeLV infection was excluded by polymerase chain reaction methods for exogenous FeLV DNA. Enterocyte lesions involved the crypts in cats with PV enteritis, FAE, and EUE and the villous tips in cats with CoV enteritis. Inflammatory infiltration was generally dominated by mononuclear cells and was moderate in the unaltered intestine and in cats with PV enteritis and marked in cats with FAE, CoV enteritis, and EUE. In cats with EUE, myeloid/histiocyte antigen-positive macrophages were relatively numerous, suggesting recruitment of peripheral blood monocytes. Lymphoid tissues were depleted in cats with PV enteritis and with EUE but were normal or hyperplastic in cats with FAE. Bone marrow activity was decreased in cats with PV enteritis; in cats with FAE or EUE and in FeLV-positive cats without enterocyte alterations, activity was slightly increased. In cats with FAE and PV enteritis, a T-cell-dominated response prevailed. EUE showed some parallels to human inflammatory bowel disease, indicating a potential harmful effect of infiltrating macrophages on the intestinal epithelium.","Kipar, A; Kremendahl, J; Jackson, M L; Reinacher, M",Veterinary pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11467470/,73
186793,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).,2003,"BACKGROUND In recent years, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has become more acceptable for obese patients. Single-port sleeve gastrectomy (SPSG) is more popular since each abdominal incision carries the risk of bleeding, hernia, and internal organ injury as well as exponentially affecting cosmesis. This cross-sectional study aimed at comparing multi-port sleeve gastrectomy (MPSG) and SPSG in terms of their early results and complications. METHODS Out of129 obese patients candidated for LSG, 102 patients were assigned to 2 groups of SPSG and MPSG. Complications and demographic data such as body mass index (BMI), age, gender, operation time, and hospital stay were measured. All surgeries were carried out between2013 and 2015 in Shiraz, Iran. Data analysis was performed using SPSS, version 16 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The continuous and categorical variables were compared using the Student t-test and the Chi-square test or the Fisher exact test, respectively. RESULTS The patients' data from both groups were similar in terms of age, intraoperative and postoperative bleeding volume, and length of hospital stay. Mean BMI was 42.8±0.7 in the SPSG group and 45.3±1.2 in the MPSG group. Duration of surgery was significantly lower in the SPSG group (P<0.001). Only 1 patient from the SPSG group and 5 patients from the MPSG group had bleeding as an early complication. CONCLUSION The differences in each complication between the groups were not statistically significant. SPSG seems to be safe and is the same as MPSG in terms of major postoperative complications.

The 913P mutant was expressed mainly as a faster-migrating, lower-molecular-weight S(L) form, while the wild type and all other mutants produced similar levels of both the S(L) form and the slower-migrating, higher-molecular-weight S(H) form. The wild-type S(L) form was processed to the S(H) form, whereas the S(L) form of the 913P mutant was inefficiently converted to the S(H) form after biosynthesis. None of these mutations affected cell surface expression or binding to its cognate ACE2 receptor. In a human immunodeficiency virus type 1/SARS S coexpression study, all mutants except the 913P mutant incorporated the S(H) form into the virions as effectively as did the wild-type S(H) form. The mutation at Ile-1151 did not affect membrane fusion or viral entry. The impaired viral entry of the 927P, 941P, 955P, and 1165P mutants was due to their inability to mediate membrane fusion, whereas the defect in viral entry of the 1179P mutant occurred not at the stage of membrane fusion but rather at a postfusion stage.

After dissection of the serosa of the dorsal and ventral sides of the gall bladder, including Calot's triangle, the angled tip of the hook cautery is inserted between the cystic artery and duct with its tip placed dorsally. The tip is then rotated in a clockwise manner to avoid bile duct injury, allowing the connective tissue between them to be hooked, coagulated and cut. This procedure is repeated several times, followed by dissection between the cystic artery and the liver bed to achieve a critical view. From December 2008 to May 2011, 121 patients underwent SILC using HRT in our hospital without any serious complications. This technique is suitable for SILC, as it is consists of simple procedures that can be performed safely and easily, even by left hand in a cross-over approach, and it allows complete dissection of Calot's triangle to achieve a critical view without using any dissector under dangerous in-line viewing.","Idani, Hitoshi; Nakano, Kanyu; Asami, Shinya; Kubota, Tetsushi; Komoto, Satoshi; Kurose, Yohei; Kubo, Shinichiro; Nojima, Hiroki; Hioki, Katsuyoshi; Kin, Hitoshi; Takakura, Norihisa",Acta medica Okayama,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23970325/,73

However, during 2004-2005, an estimated 1,519 children aged <2 years were treated in U.S. emergency departments for adverse events, including overdoses, associated with cough and cold medications. In response to reports of infant deaths after such events, CDC and the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME) investigated deaths in U.S. infants aged <12 months associated with cough and cold medications. This report describes the results of that investigation, which identified deaths of three infants aged <6 months in 2005, for which cough and cold medications were determined by medical examiners or coroners to be the underlying cause. The dosages at which cough and cold medications can cause illness or death in children aged <2 years are not known. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dosing recommendations for clinicians prescribing cough and cold medications do not exist for this age group. Because of the risks for toxicity, absence of dosing recommendations, and limited published evidence of effectiveness of these medications in children aged <2 years, parents and other caregivers should not administer cough and cold medications to children in this age group without first consulting health-care provider and should follow the provider's instructions precisely. Clinicians should use caution when prescribing cough and cold medications to children aged <2 years. Moreover, clinicians should always ask caregivers about their use of over-the-counter combination medications to avoid overdose in children from multiple medications that contain the same ingredient.",,MMWR.

METHODS A retrospective chart abstraction was performed. ANOVA and chi-square tests were performed with significance preset at P<0.05. RESULTS Of 821 consecutive patients undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy, 257 underwent elective appendectomy with the ultrasonic scalpel, either as part of their staging, treatment for pelvic pain, or prophylaxis against appendicitis. Comparing the 2 groups, no difference existed in mean age of 50+/-10 years or mean BMI of 27.6+/-6.7. Both groups had a similar mean blood loss of 130 mL. Surgery took less time (137 vs 118 minutes, P<0.0012) and the hospital stay was shorter in the appendectomy group (1.5 vs 1.2, P<0.0001) possibly because it was performed incidentally in most cases. No complications were attributable to the appendectomy, and complication types and rates in both groups were similar. Though all appendicies appeared normal, pathology was documented in 9%, including 3 carcinoid tumors. CONCLUSIONS Incidental appendectomy during total laparoscopic hysterectomy is not associated with significant risk and can be routinely offered to patients planning elective gynecologic laparoscopic procedures, as is standard for open procedures.","O'Hanlan, Katherine A; Fisher, Deidre T; O'Holleran, Michael S",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18237505/,73

The traditional emphasis on anatomical identification of disease, using percent luminal stenosis, results in suboptimal identification of lesions likely to produce recurrent ischemia and, consequently, results in poor patient selection and hampers the development of new aggressive treatments. The traditional emphasis on time since symptom onset and alleged need to achieve complete revascularization in patients with acute ischemic stroke ignores the very nature and degree of the underlying culprit lesion and hampers our understanding of the relationships between the patient's original ischemic state, revascularization, reperfusion, reperfusion injury and hemorrhagic transformation. The trajectory for the study and care of cerebrovascular patients needs to adapt, as it has in cardiology, employing hemodynamics and pathophysiology as the new guideposts for advancement. We introduce fractional flow as one hemodynamic parameter to be utilized to set a course on this new path for the care of stroke patients.","Liebeskind, David S; Feldmann, Edward",Interventional neurology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23730308/,73

We treated consecutive six patients with PEG hydrogel sealant in posterior fossa operation. Three of six cases suffered delayed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak after watertight dural closure with the PEG hydrogel sealant, although there was no leak case which was treated with fibrin glue, before 2 years until the adoption of the new material. These patients underwent posterior fossa craniotomy and discharged without remarkable CSF leak. The pseudomeningocele under the occipital wound caused the CSF leak occurr from 5th to 7th week postoperatively. All CSF leak cases needed surgical repair. At the repair, the PEG hydrogel was liquefied and almost absorbed. A fistula on the closure line and a dead space after the absorption of the PEG hydrogel was observed. When the absorbable PEG hydrogel sealant plugs in small gaps of sutured dura, its properties to prevent adhesion might suppress healing process of dural closure, so that CSF could leak through the gaps and collect as a pseudomeningocele in the dead space after absorption of the PEG hydrogel. In posterior fossa surgery a PEG hydrogel sealant should be applied when dural edges are closed tightly without any gaps.","Jito, Junya; Nitta, Naoki; Nozaki, Kazuhiko",Neurologia medico-chirurgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24305019/,73
197117,Advancements in the battle against severe acute respiratory syndrome.,2004,"To locate the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) packaging signal, the incorporation of TGEV subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) into virions was first addressed. TGEV virions were purified by three different techniques, including an immunopurification using an M protein-specific monoclonal antibody. Detection of sgmRNAs in virions by specific reverse transcription-PCRs (RT-PCRs) was related to the purity of virus preparations. Interestingly, virus mRNAs were detected in partially purified virus but not in virus immunopurified using stringent conditions. Analyses by quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that virus mRNAs were not present in highly purified preparations. Lack of sgmRNA encapsidation was probably due to the absence of a packaging signal (Psi) within these mRNAs. This information plus that from the encapsidation of a collection of TGEV-derived minigenomes suggested that Psi is located at the 5' end of the genome. To confirm that this was the case, a set of minigenomes was expressed that included an expression cassette for an mRNA including the beta-glucuronidase gene (GUS) plus variable sequence fragments from the 5' end of the virus genome potentially including Psi. Insertion of the first 649 nucleotides (nt) of the TGEV genome led to the specific encapsidation of the mRNA, indicating that a Psi was located within this region which was absent from all of the other virus mRNAs. The presence of this packaging signal was further confirmed by showing the expression and rescue of the mRNA including the first 649 nt of the TGEV genome under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter in TGEV-infected cells. This mRNA was successfully amplified and encapsidated, indicating that the first 649 nt of TGEV genome also contained the 5' cis-acting replication signals. The encapsidation efficiency of this mRNA was about 30-fold higher than the genome encapsidation efficiency, as estimated by quantitative RT-PCR. In contrast, viral mRNAs presented significantly lower encapsidation efficiencies (about 100-fold) than those of the virus genome, strongly suggesting that TGEV mRNAs in fact lacked an alternative TGEV Psi.","Escors, David; Izeta, Ander; Capiscol, Carmen; Enjuanes, Luis",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12829829/,73

200715,SARS-CoV-2 screening of asymptomatic healthcare workers,2020,"A human rights-based approach (HRBA) to health has long been seen as an important way in which to address public health needs in a manner that is equitable and conducive to social justice. Yet the actual content of an HRBA to health remains unspecific, and therefore implementation remains heterogeneous. This situation is even more challenging in the field of mental health, where human rights considerations are particularly complex and have emerged out of a history of myriad violations. Even when research has been conducted into mental health, it has focused predominantly on the Global North, raising questions of contextual and cultural relevance. Accordingly, this study examined the issue from the perspectives of stakeholders in Kenya who consider their work or the services they use to be rights based. It explored the key principles and interventions deemed to constitute an HRBA to mental health care and psychosocial support, the perceived benefits of such approaches, and the main barriers and supports relevant for implementation. The results produced seven key principles and corresponding interventions. Among other things, it highlighted the importance of economic well-being and self-efficacy, as well as the reduction of barriers to implementation, such as stigma and lack of adequate resourcing. Two key tensions were apparent-namely, the un/acceptability of coercion and the role of traditional and faith-based modalities in an HRBA to mental health care and psychosocial support.","Mahomed, Faraaz; Bhabha, Jacqueline; Stein, Michael Ashley; Pūras, Dainius",Health and human rights,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33390703/,73

205219,Is a step-down antiretroviral therapy necessary to fight severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in HIV-infected patients?,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, ventilator sharing was suggested to increase availability of mechanical ventilation. The safety and feasibility of ventilator sharing is unknown. METHODS: A single ventilator in pressure control mode was used with flow control valves to simultaneously ventilate two patients with different lung compliances. The system was first evaluated using high-fidelity human patient simulator mannequins and then tested for 1 h in two pairs of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure. Patients were matched on positive end-expiratory pressure, fractional inspired oxygen tension, and respiratory rate. Tidal volume and peak airway pressure (PMAX) were recorded from each patient using separate independent spirometers and arterial blood gas samples drawn at 0, 30, and 60 min. The authors assessed acid-base status, oxygenation, tidal volume, and PMAX for each patient. Stability was assessed by calculating the coefficient of variation. RESULTS: The valves performed as expected in simulation, providing a stable tidal volume of 400 ml each to two mannequins with compliance ratios varying from 20:20 to 20:90 ml/cm H2O. The system was then tested in two pairs of patients. Pair 1 was a 49-yr-old woman, ideal body weight 46 kg, and a 55-yr-old man, ideal body weight 64 kg, with lung compliance 27 ml/cm H2O versus 35 ml/cm H2O. The coefficient of variation for tidal volume was 0.2 to 1.7%, and for PMAX 0 to 1.1%. Pair 2 was a 32-yr-old man, ideal body weight 62 kg, and a 56-yr-old woman, ideal body weight 46 kg, with lung compliance 12 ml/cm H2O versus 21 ml/cm H2O. The coefficient of variation for tidal volume was 0.4 to 5.6%, and for PMAX 0 to 2.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Differential ventilation using a single ventilator is feasible. Flow control valves enable delivery of stable tidal volume and PMAX similar to those provided by individual ventilators.","Levin, Matthew A; Shah, Anjan; Shah, Ronak; Kane, Erica; Zhou, George; Eisenkraft, James B; Chen, Martin D",Anesthesiology,,73

In addition, design new proteins in a methodical way is a major engineering challenge. In this work, we introduce a joint geometric-neural networks approach for comparing, deforming and generating 3D protein structures. Viewing protein structures as 3D open curves, we adopt the Square Root Velocity Function (SRVF) representation and leverage its suitable geometric properties along with Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) for a joint registration and comparison. Our ResNets handle better large protein deformations while being more computationally efficient. On top of the mathematical framework, we further design a Geometric Variational Auto-Encoder (G-VAE), that once trained, maps original, previously unseen structures, into a low-dimensional (latent) hyper-sphere. Motivated by the spherical structure of the pre-shape space, we naturally adopt the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution to model our hidden variables. We test the effectiveness of our models by generating novel protein structures and predicting completions of corrupted protein structures. Experimental results show that our method is able to generate plausible structures, different from the structures in the training data.","Huang, Hao; Amor, Boulbaba Ben; Lin, Xichan; Zhu, Fan; Fang, Yi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11920v1.pdf,73

Patients with diabetes were compared with individuals without diabetes, and the correlation was performed between thiamine and lactate levels. Thiamine levels <28 µg/L were considered as thiamine deficiency. RESULTS: Overall, 270 patients met the inclusion criteria; 51.1% were men, and the median age was 74 years (66.8-81). The median value of thiamine was 54.0 µg/L (38-72.3), and 15.6% had thiamine deficiency. Among patients with diabetes, 26.3% had thiamine deficiency, and 69.3% had hyperlactatemia. There was an association between thiamine deficiency and diabetes (odds ratio 4.28; 95% CI, 2.08-8.81; P < .001). There was a strong negative correlation between thiamine and arterial lactate in patients with diabetes (r = -0.711, P < .001) and a moderate negative correlation in critically ill patients without diabetes (r = -0.489, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of thiamine deficiency in critically ill patients due to coronavirus disease 2019 is higher in patients with diabetes. There is a negative correlation between thiamine and arterial lactate levels, which is higher in people with diabetes.","Gonçalves, Sandra Elisa Adami Batista; Gonçalves, Thiago José Martins; Guarnieri, Andreia; Risegato, Rodrigo Cristovão; Guimarães, Maysa Penteado; de Freitas, Daniella Cabral",J. diabetes (Online),,73
239853,Regional difference in the rate of spread of SARS-CoV-2,2020,"PURPOSE: Computerized tomography (CT) imaging is increasingly being used to evaluate patients with ankle trauma. However, conventional CT (C CT) has a significantly higher radiation dose (RD) than plain radiography. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of ultra-low-dose CT (ULDCT) protocol for ankle fractures. METHODS: Ninety-eight consecutive patients who had ankle CT for suspected ankle fracture were included in our prospective study. C CT and ULDCT protocols were simultaneously performed on these 98 patients. Two observers independently evaluated ULDCT and C CT images. The effective RD of the ULDCT and C CT groups was calculated. RESULTS: The interobserver agreement was 1 (perfect). ULDCT and C CT group images showed no significant difference in image quality. The effective RD of the ULDCT was significantly lower than the C CT (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: By evaluating the results of this study, ULDCT proved to be a reliable diagnostic imaging method for fractures of the ankle. The satisfactory diagnostic image quality of the ULDCT protocol provides promising results. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II/lesser quality RCT or prospective comparative study.","Tuncer, Kutsi; Topal, Murat; Tekin, Erdal; Sade, Recep; Pirimoglu, Rüstem Berhan; Polat, Gokhan",J Orthop Surg (Hong Kong),,73
244565,SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic vaccinated-healthcare workers,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced infection can be associated with a coagulopathy, findings consistent with infection-induced inflammatory changes as observed in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). The lack of prior immunity to COVID-19 has resulted in large numbers of infected patients across the globe and uncertainty regarding management of the complications that arise in the course of this viral illness. The lungs are the target organ for COVID-19; patients develop acute lung injury that can progress to respiratory failure, although multiorgan failure can also occur. The initial coagulopathy of COVID-19 presents with prominent elevation of D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen-degradation products, whereas abnormalities in prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet counts are relatively uncommon in initial presentations. Coagulation test screening, including the measurement of D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, is suggested. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy should be managed as it would be for any critically ill patient, following the established practice of using thromboembolic prophylaxis for critically ill hospitalized patients, and standard supportive care measures for those with sepsis-induced coagulopathy or DIC. Although D-dimer, sepsis physiology, and consumptive coagulopathy are indicators of mortality, current data do not suggest the use of full-intensity anticoagulation doses unless otherwise clinically indicated. Even though there is an associated coagulopathy with COVID-19, bleeding manifestations, even in those with DIC, have not been reported. If bleeding does occur, standard guidelines for the management of DIC and bleeding should be followed.","Connors, Jean M; Levy, Jerrold H",Blood,,73

251691,Novel biosensor platforms for the detection of coronavirus infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic started in China in early December 2019, and quickly spread around the world. The epidemic gradually started in Italy at the end of February 2020, and by May 31, 2020, 232,664 cases and 33,340 deaths were confirmed. As a result of this pandemic, the Italian Ministerial Decree issued on March 11, 2020, enforced lockdown; therefore, many social, recreational, and cultural centers remained closed for months. In Apulia (southern Italy), all non-urgent hospital activities were suspended, and some wards were closed, with a consequent reduction in the use of the water network and the formation of stagnant water. This situation could enhance the risk of exposure of people to waterborne diseases, including legionellosis. The purpose of this study was to monitor the microbiological quality of the water network (coliforms, E. coli, Enterococci, P. aeruginosa, and Legionella) in three wards (A, B and C) of a large COVID-19 regional hospital, closed for three months due to the COVID-19 emergency. Our study revealed that all three wards' water network showed higher contamination by Legionella pneumophila sg 1 and sg 6 at T1 (after lockdown) compared to the period before the lockdown (T0). In particular, ward A at T1 showed a median value = 5600 CFU/L (range 0-91,000 CFU/L) vs T0, median value = 75 CFU/L (range 0-5000 CFU/L) (p-value = 0.014); ward B at T1 showed a median value = 200 CFU/L (range 0-4200 CFU/L) vs T0, median value = 0 CFU/L (range 0-300 CFU/L) (p-value = 0.016) and ward C at T1 showed a median value = 175 CFU/L (range 0-22,000 CFU/L) vs T0, median value = 0 CFU/L (range 0-340 CFU/L) (p-value < 0.001). In addition, a statistically significant difference was detected in ward B between the number of positive water samples at T0 vs T1 for L. pneumophila sg 1 and sg 6 (24% vs 80% p-value < 0.001) and for coliforms (0% vs 64% p-value < 0.001). Moreover, a median value of coliform load resulted 3 CFU/100 ml (range 0-14 CFU/100 ml) at T1, showing a statistically significant increase versus T0 (0 CFU/100 ml) (p-value < 0.001). Our results highlight the need to implement a water safety plan that includes staff training and a more rigorous environmental microbiological surveillance in all hospitals before occupying a closed ward for a longer than one week, according to national and international guidelines.","De Giglio, Osvalda; Diella, Giusy; Lopuzzo, Marco; Triggiano, Francesco; Calia, Carla; Pousis, Chrysovalentinos; Fasano, Fabrizio; Caggiano, Giuseppina; Calabrese, Giuseppe; Rafaschieri, Vincenza; Carpagnano, Federica; Carlucci, Matilde; Gesualdo, Loreto; Ricci, Maria Luisa; Scaturro, Maria; Rota, Maria Cristina; Bonadonna, Lucia; Lucentini, Luca; Montagna, Maria Teresa",Environ Res,,73

Key information on the psychosocial responses of such healthcare workers (HCWs) in the context of COVID-19 is limited and in particular there is a need for studies that utilise longitudinal methods, an overarching theoretical model, and use of a cohort of participants within a defined geographical area across acute and community settings. The work packages making up the current research project use quantitative and qualitative methods to examine the psychological sequelae for HCWs in the context of COVID-19 in geographically adjacent healthcare areas (South and Mid-West of Ireland) across four time points (induction, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year follow-up). The quantitative arm of the project (WP 1) utilises the Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM-SR) and examines a number of key psychological factors pertinent to this model including perceptions about COVID-19 and infection more generally, coping, formal and informal support and a number of impact variables including mood, sleep quality, and perceptions of stigma. The qualitative study (WP 2) will address HCWs experiences of working during the pandemic, ascertain any additional areas of psychological functioning, environmental and workplace factors and resources that may be utilised by HCWs and that are not assessed by the quantitative study protocol, focusing particularly on those staff groups typically underrepresented in previous studies.","Fortune, D.

256470,Contamination of filtering face piece 3 masks with SARS-COV-2 during endotracheal intubation,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 is a serious respiratory virus pandemic. Patient characteristics, knowledge of the COVID-19 disease, risk behaviour and mental state will differ between individuals. The primary aim of this study was to investigate these variables in patients visiting an emergency department in the Netherlands during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare the ""COVID-19 suspected"" (positive and negative tested group) with the ""COVID-19 not suspected"" (control group) and to compare in the ""COVID-19 suspected"" group, the positive and negative tested patients. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients, visiting the emergency room at the Franciscus Gasthuis & Vlietland, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, were asked to fill out questionnaires on the abovementioned items on an iPad. The patients were either ""COVID-19 suspected"" (positive and negative tested group) or ""COVID-19 not suspected"" (control group). RESULTS: This study included a total of 159 patients, 33 (21%) tested positive, 85 (53%) negative and 41 (26%) were COVID-19 not suspected (control group). All patients in this study were generally aware of transmission risks and virulence and adhered to the non-pharmaceutical interventions. Working as a health care professional was correlated to a higher risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection (p- value 0.04). COVID-19 suspected patients had a significantly higher level of anxiety compared to COVID-19 not suspected patients (p-value < 0.001). The higher the anxiety, the more seriously hygiene measures were followed. The anxiety scores of the patients with (pulmonary) comorbidities were significantly higher than without comorbidities. CONCLUSION: This is one of the first (large) study that investigates and compares patient characteristics, knowledge, behaviour, illness perception, and mental state with respect to COVID-19 of patients visiting the emergency room, subdivided as being suspected of having COVID-19 (positive or negative tested) and a control group not suspected of having COVID-19. All patients in this study were generally aware of transmission risks and virulence and adhered to the non-pharmaceutical interventions. COVID-19 suspected patients and patients with (pulmonary) comorbidities were significantly more anxious. However, there is no mass hysteria regarding COVID-19. The higher the degree of fear, the more carefully hygiene measures were observed. Knowledge about the coping of the population during the COVID-19 pandemic is very important, certainly also in the perspective of a possible second outbreak of COVID-19.","van der Valk, J P M; Heijboer, F W J; van Middendorp, H; Evers, A W M; 039, In; t Veen, J C C M",PLoS One,,73

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine if self-reported symptoms could help monitor the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in France. METHODS: Users were asked questions about underlying conditions, sociodemographic status, zip code, and COVID-19 symptoms. Depending on the symptoms reported and the presence of coexisting disorders, users were told to either stay at home, contact a general practitioner (GP), or call an emergency phone number. Data regarding COVID-19-related hospitalizations were retrieved from the Ministry of Health. RESULTS: As of March 29, 2020, the application was opened 4,126,789 times; 3,799,535 electronic questionnaires were filled out; and 2,477,174 users had at least one symptom. In total, 34.8% (n=1,322,361) reported no symptoms. The remaining users were directed to self-monitoring (n=858,878, 22.6%), GP visit or teleconsultation (n=1,033,922, 27.2%), or an emergency phone call (n=584,374, 15.4%). Emergency warning signs were reported by 39.1% of participants with anosmia, a loss of the sense of smell (n=127,586) versus 22.7% of participants without anosmia (n=1,597,289). Anosmia and fever and/or cough were correlated with hospitalizations for COVID-19 (Spearman correlation coefficients=0.87 and 0.82, respectively; P<.001 for both). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that anosmia may be strongly associated with COVID-19 and its severity.

274478,Response to Cioffi,2020,"Abstract Introduction Preventive measures taken during periods of health crisis, specifically in pandemics, have consistently been associated with detrimental effects on mental health. Isolation and loneliness are indirect effects of these preventive measures. Given these premises, monitoring the behavior of the population in the face of these eventualities becomes important. Worry as an indirect measure of anxiety and stress enables one to recognize subjects who are vulnerable to phenomena of high uncertainty, since measures taken to avoid excessive contagion can have high costs for this population. This phenomenon has been consistently observed in other pandemics such as H1/N1 influenza. Objective To determine the prevalence of worry and perceived risk of contagion in the Guadalajara population during the COVID-19 quarantine and to identify differentiating effects. Method A total of 255 people from western Mexico (Guadalajara, Jalisco) voluntarily participated by answering the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) adapted to Mexican population. The average age of the respondents, aged between 18 and 70 years, was 31.71 (± 5.19). A total of 170 women and 85 men participated in the study. Results 40.12% of the population scored high levels of worry, making them vulnerable to mental health conditions. Subjects favored the prevention of a contagion regardless of whether they were self-isolated. The only variable that had a differential effect was sex (p &lt; .05), and there were no differences in educational attainment, occupational demandingness, and isolation between the groups. Discussion and conclusion A preventive attitude was observed among the participants, and so it is important to implement strategies that will prevent mental health costs in those who express excessive worry to avoid saturating mental health services.","Guzmán-González, Jesua Iván; Sánchez-García, Franco Giordano; Ramírez-de los Santos, Saúl; Gutiérrez-Rodríguez, Francisco; Palomino-Esparza, David; Telles-Martínez, Ana Laura",Salud ment,,73

Aiming to correctly use the experience of the epidemic evolution from one local to another, we present an analysis of the transmission rate of COVID-19 as a function of population size at the metropolitan area level for the United States. Contrary to the usual hypothesis in epidemics modeling, we observe that the disease transmissibility scales with the logarithm of the local's population size. The analysis, made possible by a large amount of data available on simultaneous epidemics of the same type, is universal for any human-to-human transmission disease.

However, this paper focuses on barriers that immigrants of diverse statuses already living in the U.S.-along with their families-may face in accessing health services during the pandemic, as well as implications of these barriers for COVID-19 prevention and response efforts . We report findings from a scoping review about immigration status as a social determinant of health and discuss ways that immigration status can impede access to health care across levels of the social ecology . We then explore how recent changes to federal immigration policies and current COVID-19 federal relief efforts may serve to create additional barriers to health care for immigrants and their families. Improving health care access for immigrant populations in the U.S. will require interventions at all levels of the social ecology and across vari ous social determinants of health, both in response to COVID-19 and to strengthen health systems more broadly.","Hill, Jessica; Rodriguez, Darlene Xiomara; McDaniel, Paul N",J Migr Health,,73
284333,Safe use of hydroxychloroquine and its combination with azithromycin in the context of Sars-CoV-2 outbreak: Clinical experience in a Belgian tertiary center,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has shocked the sports world because of the suspension of competitions and the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among athletes. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, cardio-pulmonary complications can occur and, before the resumption of sports competitions, a screening has been recommended. However, few data are available and discrepancies exist in the screening modalities. We conducted this prospective study to investigate the incidence of cardiovascular consequences following SARS-CoV-2 infection in young adult competitive athletes and the appropriate screening strategies for a safe return-to-play. METHODS: Ninety competitive athletes (24 ± 10 years) after asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened by physical examination, blood testing, spirometry, 12­lead resting ECG, 24-h ambulatory ECG monitoring, echocardiogram, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). RESULTS: Sixty-four athletes (71.1%) were male, and most (76.7%) were mildly symptomatic. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, spirometry and resting ECG were normal in all athletes. Ambulatory ECG monitoring demonstrated <50/24 h supraventricular and ventricular premature beats in 53.3% and 52.2% of athletes, respectively, in the absence of malignant arrhythmias. CPET did not demonstrate cardiopulmonary limitations. Echocardiography showed pericardial effusion in 3 athletes (all females) with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (3.3%; 4.4% in the symptomatic group) with a definitive diagnosis of myopericarditis in 1 athlete (1.1%) and pericarditis in 2 athletes (2.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection were found in 3.3% of competitive athletes. An appropriate screening primarily based on the detection of uncommon arrhythmias and cardiac symptoms should be recommended in competitive athletes after SARS-CoV-2 infection to detect a cardiac involvement and guarantee a safe return-to-play.","Cavigli, Luna; Frascaro, Federica; Turchini, Francesca; Mochi, Nicola; Sarto, Patrizio; Bianchi, Stefano; Parri, Antonio; Carraro, Nicolò; Valente, Serafina; Focardi, Marta; Cameli, Matteo; Bonifazi, Marco; D039,; Ascenzi, Flavio",Int J Cardiol,,73

295711,Antimicrobial stewardship interventions to minimize healthcare worker exposure to SARS-CoV-2,2020,"BACKGROUND: The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive persons who are asymptomatic-and whether this proportion is age-dependent-are still open research questions. Because an unknown proportion of reported symptoms among SARS-CoV-2 positives will be attributable to another infection or affliction, the observed, or 'crude' proportion without symptoms may underestimate the proportion of persons without symptoms that are caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Based on two rounds of a large population-based serological study comprising test results on seropositivity and self-reported symptom history conducted in April/May and June/July 2020 in the Netherlands (n = 7517), we estimated the proportion of reported symptoms among those persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 that is attributable to this infection, where the set of relevant symptoms fulfills the ECDC case definition of COVID-19, using inferential methods for the attributable risk (AR). Generalised additive regression modelling was used to estimate the age-dependent relative risk (RR) of reported symptoms, and the AR and asymptomatic proportion (AP) were calculated from the fitted RR. RESULTS: Using age-aggregated data, the 'crude' AP was 37% but the model-estimated AP was 65% (95% CI 63-68%). The estimated AP varied with age, from 74% (95% CI 65-90%) for < 20 years, to 61% (95% CI 57-65%) for the 50-59 years age-group. CONCLUSION: Whereas the 'crude' AP represents a lower bound for the proportion of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 without COVID-19 symptoms, the AP as estimated via an attributable risk approach represents an upper bound. Age-specific AP estimates can inform the implementation of public health actions such as targetted virological testing and therefore enhance containment strategies.","McDonald, Scott A; Miura, Fuminari; Vos, Eric R A; van Boven, Michiel; de Melker, Hester E; van der Klis, Fiona R M; van Binnendijk, Rob S; den Hartog, Gerco; Wallinga, Jacco",Eur. j. epidemiol,,73

In this context, we must guarantee the provision of acute stroke care and optimise code stroke protocols to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and rationalise the use of hospital resources. The Madrid Stroke multidisciplinary group presents a series of recommendations to achieve these goals. METHODS: We conducted a non-systematic literature search using the keywords ""stroke"" and ""COVID-19"" or ""coronavirus"" or ""SARS-CoV-2."" Our literature review also included other relevant studies known to the authors. Based on this literature review, a series of consensus recommendations were established by the Madrid Stroke multidisciplinary group and its neurology committee. RESULTS: These recommendations address 5 main objectives: 1) coordination of action protocols to ensure access to hospital care for stroke patients; 2) recognition of potentially COVID-19-positive stroke patients; 3) organisation of patient management to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare professionals; 4) avoidance of unnecessary neuroimaging studies and other procedures that may increase the risk of infection; and 5) safe, early discharge and follow-up to ensure bed availability. This management protocol has been called CORONA (Coordinate, Recognise, Organise, Neuroimaging, At home). CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations presented here may assist in the organisation of acute stroke care and the optimisation of healthcare resources, while ensuring the safety of healthcare professionals.","Rodríguez-Pardo, J; Fuentes, B; Alonso de Leciñana, M; Campollo, J; Calleja Castaño, P; Carneado Ruiz, J; Egido Herrero, J; García Leal, R; Gil Núñez, A; Gómez Cerezo, J F; Martín Martínez, A; Masjuán Vallejo, J; Palomino Aguado, B; Riera López, N; Simón de Las Heras, R; Vivancos Mora, J; Díez Tejedor, E",Neurologia,,73

316791,Combining Procalcitonin and Rapid Multiplex Respiratory Virus Testing for Antibiotic Stewardship in Older Adult Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Infection,2020,"Reductions in perioperative surgical site infections are obtained by a multifaceted approach including patient decolonization, hand hygiene, and hub disinfection, and environmental cleaning. Associated surveillance of S. aureus transmission quantifies the effectiveness of the basic measures to prevent the transmission to patients and clinicians of pathogenic bacteria and viruses, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To measure transmission, the observational units are pairs of successive surgical cases in the same operating room on the same day. We evaluated appropriate sample sizes and strategies for measuring transmission. There was absence of serial correlation among observed counts of transmitted isolates within each of several periods (all P &#8805;.18). Similarly, observing transmission within or between cases of a pair did not increase the probability that the next sampled pair of cases also had observed transmission (all P &#8805;.23). Most pairs of cases had no detected transmitted isolates. Also, although transmission (yes/no) was associated with surgical site infection (P =.004), among cases with transmission, there was no detected dose response between counts of transmitted isolates and probability of infection (P =.25). The first of a fixed series of tests is to use the binomial test to compare the proportion of pairs of cases with S. aureus transmission to an acceptable threshold. An appropriate sample size for this screening is N =25 pairs. If significant, more samples are obtained while additional measures are implemented to reduce transmission and infections. Subsequent sampling is done to evaluate effectiveness. The two independent binomial proportions are compared using Boschloo's exact test. The total sample size for the 1st and 2nd stage is N =100 pairs. Because S. aureus transmission is invisible without testing, when choosing what population(s) to screen for surveillance, another endpoint needs to be used (e.g., infections). Only 10/298 combinations of specialty and operating room were relatively common (&#8805;1.0% of cases) and had expected incidence &#8805;0.20 infections per 8 hours of sampled cases. The 10 combinations encompassed â 17% of cases, showing the value of targeting surveillance of transmission to a few combinations of specialties and rooms. In conclusion, we created a sampling protocol and appropriate sample sizes for using S. aureus transmission within and between pairs of successive cases in the same operating room, the purpose being to monitor the quality of prevention of intraoperative spread of pathogenic bacteria and viruses.","Dexter, Franklin; Ledolter, Johannes; Wall, Russell T; Datta, Subhradeep; Loftus, Randy W",Perioper Care Oper Room Manag,,73

Methods: Identifying, using the Buzzsumo analytic tool, 30 most frequently shared articles in April 2020 about COVID-19 prevention and classifying them according to number of shares, accuracy, topic and sharing platform. Calculations were made using descriptive statistics tools and chi-square test. Results: The top 30 articles about coronavirus prevention were shared 4904 160 times over a period of one month with 96.8% of all shares through Facebook. Most of the articles (80%) was found to be accurate, however they accounted for only 64% of shares. The inaccuracies referred mostly to handwashing. The most shared articles were about medications followed by masks and hand washing. Conclusions: Articles about coronavirus prevention are usually accurate, yet relatively less likely to be shared than inaccurate ones. Facebook remains a dominant social media platform for sharing content. Buzzsumo could be considered a tool in certain situations such as pandemic for health authorities to quickly investigate different health topics popular on social media. Lay Summary: Most of the articles about COVID-19 prevention, identified as most frequently shared through social media platform during the pandemic, was found to be accurate.

320971,Clinical experience with use of remdesivir in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2: A case series,2020,"In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and the universal chaos created by it, this study explores the role of sense of coherence (Soc, Antonovsky, 1979) and how it enables coping with a stressful situation and staying well. SOC is a generalized orientation which allows one to perceive the world as comprehensible, manageable, and meaningful. In an attempt to understand ‘how does the SOC work’ we employed the salutogenic assumption that a strong SOC allows one to reach out in any given situation and find those resources appropriate to the specific stressor. Thus, we hypothesized that the positive impact of SOC on mental health outcomes would be mediated through coping resources that are particularly salient in times of crisis. One resource is related to the micro level (perceived family support) and the other concerns the macro level (trust in leaders and social-political institutions). Data collection was conducted in different countries during May–June 2020 via online platforms. The data included 7 samples of adult participants (age 18–90) from Israel (n ​= ​669), Italy (n ​= ​899), Spain (n ​= ​476), Germany (n ​= ​708), Austria (n ​= ​1026), Switzerland (n ​= ​147), and the U.S. (n ​= ​506). The questionnaires included standard tools (MHC-SF, SOC-13) as well as questionnaires of perceived family support and trust that were adapted to the pandemic context. As expected, SOC was associated with mental health in all the samples. Perceived family support and trust in leaders and social-political institutions mediated the relationships between SOC and mental health, controlling for age, gender, and level of financial risk. It appears that SOC has a universal meaning, not limited by cultural and situational characteristics. The discussion focuses on the theoretical, social, and political applications of the salutogenic model – and its core concept of SOC – in the context of coping with a global pandemic across different cultural contexts and countries.","Mana, A.; Bauer, G.

DESIGN: A data-driven spatio-temporal modelling to simulate the spread of COVID-19 worldwide for 150 days since 1 January 2020 under different scenarios. SETTING: Worldwide. INTERVENTIONS: Travel restrictions and public health countermeasures. MAIN OUTCOME: The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases could reach more than 420 million around the world without any countermeasures taken. Under timely and intensive global interventions, 99.97% of infections could be avoided comparing with non-interventions. The scenario of carrying out domestic travel restriction and public health countermeasures in China only could contribute to a significant decrease of the cumulative number of infected cases worldwide. Without global travel restriction in the study setting, 98.62% of COVID-19 cases could be avoided by public health countermeasures in China only compared with non-interventions at all. CONCLUSIONS: Public health countermeasures were generally more effective than travel restrictions in many countries, suggesting multinational collaborations in the public health communities in response to this novel global health challenge.","Kong, Lingcai; Hu, Yi; Wang, Qiang; Chen, Xinda; Yao, Tong; Wang, Yu; Jin, Hui; Fan, Lijun; Du, Wei",BMJ Open,,73

Vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most promising candidates for combating this global epidemic, and scientists all over the world have made great efforts to this end. However, manipulation of the SARS-CoV-2 should be performed in the biosafety level 3 laboratory. This makes experiments complicated and time-consuming. Therefore, a safer system for working with this virus is urgently needed. Here, we report the construction of plasmid-based, non-infectious SARS-CoV-2 replicons with turbo-green fluorescent protein and/or firefly luciferase reporters by reverse genetics using transformation-associated recombination cloning in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Replication of these replicons was achieved simply by direct transfection of cells with the replicon plasmids as evident by the expression of reporter genes. Using SARS-CoV-2 replicons, the inhibitory effects of E64-D and remdesivir on SARS-CoV-2 replication were confirmed, and the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) value of remdesivir and E64-D was estimated by different quantification methods respectively, indicating that these SARS-CoV-2 replicons are useful tools for antiviral drug evaluation.","Wang, Bei; Zhang, Chongyang; Lei, Xiaobo; Ren, Lili; Zhao, Zhendong; Wang, Jianwei; Huang, He",Virol. sin.

This introduction also reflects on the changing meanings of being connected and disconnected to digital networks and platforms at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic forces many people around the world to remain physically separated from others due to lockdown and quarantine measures.","Treré, Emiliano; Natale, Simone; Keightley, Emily; Punathambekar, Aswin",Media Cult.

To a certain extent, intimal hyperplasia is present in all types of vascular reconstruction, including autologous grafts, allografts, and prosthetic grafts found in solid organs transplanted, having a substantial role in chronic rejection and following angioplasty with or without stenting. One of the greatest developments in recent years towards prevention of intimal hyperplasia is the use of ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation inhibits proliferation of many cell types including fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in vitro, and also suppresses the synthesis of collagen by cultured fibroblasts. Animal models have been a cornerstone to develop strategies aimed at understanding the basic physiopathologic mechanisms of intimal hyperplasia and at evaluating novel treatment strategies for clinical conditions. So, the aim of this study was to analyze animals models of intimal hyperplasia, type of injury, artery segments most used, as to the effects of different kinds and sources of ionizing radiation.","de Faria Bittencourt da Costa, Regina; José Fagundes, Djalma",Acta cir. bras.,,73

During February 5-March 17, 2020, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) received and transmitted contact information for 11,574 international travelers to 51 of 61 local health jurisdictions at a cost of 1,694 hours of CDPH personnel time. If resources permitted, local health jurisdictions contacted travelers, interviewed them, and oversaw 14 days of quarantine, self-monitoring, or both, based on CDC risk assessment criteria for COVID-19. Challenges encountered during follow-up included errors in the recording of contact information and variation in the availability of resources in local health jurisdictions to address the substantial workload. Among COVID-19 patients reported to CDPH, three matched persons previously reported as travelers to CDPH. Despite intensive effort, the traveler screening system did not effectively prevent introduction of COVID-19 into California. Effectiveness of COVID-19 screening and monitoring in travelers to California was limited by incomplete traveler information received by federal officials and transmitted to states, the number of travelers needing follow-up, and the potential for presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. More efficient methods of collecting and transmitting passenger data, including electronic provision of flight manifests by airlines to federal officials and flexible text-messaging tools, would help local health jurisdictions reach out to all at-risk travelers quickly, thereby facilitating timely testing, case identification, and contact investigations. State and local health departments should weigh the resources needed to implement incoming traveler monitoring against community mitigation activities, understanding that the priorities of each might shift during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Myers, Jennifer F; Snyder, Robert E; Porse, Charsey Cole; Tecle, Selam; Lowenthal, Phil; Danforth, Mary E; Powers, Edward; Kamali, Amanda; Jain, Seema; Fritz, Curtis L; Chai, Shua J",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,73

344710,SARS-CoV-2 transmission: Preliminary findings from a household-based study,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted human societies around the world. This public health emergency was followed by a significant loss of human life; the ensuing social restrictions led to loss of employment, lack of interactions, and burgeoning psychological distress. As physical distancing regulations were introduced to manage outbreaks, individuals, groups, and communities engaged extensively on social media to express their thoughts and emotions. This internet-mediated communication of self-reported information encapsulates the emotional health and mental well-being of all individuals impacted by the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This research aims to investigate the human emotions related to the COVID-19 pandemic expressed on social media over time, using an artificial intelligence (AI) framework. METHODS: Our study explores emotion classifications, intensities, transitions, and profiles, as well as alignment to key themes and topics, across the four stages of the pandemic: declaration of a global health crisis (ie, prepandemic), the first lockdown, easing of restrictions, and the second lockdown. This study employs an AI framework comprised of natural language processing, word embeddings, Markov models, and the growing self-organizing map algorithm, which are collectively used to investigate social media conversations. The investigation was carried out using 73,000 public Twitter conversations posted by users in Australia from January to September 2020. RESULTS: The outcomes of this study enabled us to analyze and visualize different emotions and related concerns that were expressed and reflected on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could be used to gain insights into citizens' mental health. First, the topic analysis showed the diverse as well as common concerns people had expressed during the four stages of the pandemic. It was noted that personal-level concerns expressed on social media had escalated to broader concerns over time. Second, the emotion intensity and emotion state transitions showed that fear and sadness emotions were more prominently expressed at first; however, emotions transitioned into anger and disgust over time. Negative emotions, except for sadness, were significantly higher (P<.05) in the second lockdown, showing increased frustration. Temporal emotion analysis was conducted by modeling the emotion state changes across the four stages of the pandemic, which demonstrated how different emotions emerged and shifted over time. Third, the concerns expressed by social media users were categorized into profiles, where differences could be seen between the first and second lockdown profiles. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the diverse emotions and concerns that were expressed and recorded on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic reflected the mental health of the general public. While this study established the use of social media to discover informed insights during a time when physical communication was impossible, the outcomes could also contribute toward postpandemic recovery and understanding psychological impact via emotion changes, and they could potentially inform health care decision making.

349135,Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in an adult after SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021,"The outbreak of the SARS CoV2 virus, commonly referred to as the COVID-19 pandemic, has impacted the social, economic, political, and cultural lives of citizens around the world. The sudden outbreak of the pandemic has exposed the legal preparedness, or lack thereof, of governments to reduce and contain its drastic impact. Strong legislative measures play a crucial role in any epidemic or pandemic situation. In this situation, the Indian Government has requested all state governments to invoke the Epidemic Disease Act (EDA) of 1897 to address the COVID-19 emergency. The Central Government has also used the powers provided in the Disaster Management Act (DMA) of 2005. As the country is facing its first major health emergency since independence, the existing legislative measures to deal with a COVID-19 like situation are lacking and require certain amendments to address such situations in the future. This paper aims to present the current constitutional and legislative response to health emergencies in India and attempts to identify gray areas in the statutory provisions. Based on the analysis, this paper suggests several recommendations for amending current legislation and suggests the promulgation of comprehensive public health law. This paper is largely based on primary sources such as the EDA and the DMA, regulations, guidelines, rules issued by the public authorities and court cases related to health and health emergencies along with secondary resources such as newspaper articles and published papers.","Gowd, Kiran Kumar; Veerababu, Donthagani; Reddy, Veeraiahgari Revanth",J Public Aff,,73

The socio-demographic and psychological correlates of PTSD-like symptoms were also examined. A total of 193 participants were recruited. More than 45% of the respondents reported significant PTSD-like symptoms related to the COVID-19; this group of patients also had a high level of pandemic-related depressive symptoms. High level of PTSD-like symptoms were predicted by rumination on concerns about the outbreak of COVID-19 and feeling of social isolation. They were also associated with hypervigilance to cues related to the pandemic. Our results suggested that the pandemic had taken a psychological toll on people living with psychiatric illness. Further research is needed to understand the development and mechanism of traumatic stress reaction in response to a prolonged infectious disease outbreak among this vulnerable population. Clinical attention is also called to mitigate the psychiatric sequalae of the pandemic in this vulnerable group of people.","Ting, Travis C M; Wong, Agatha W S; Liu, W S; Leung, Flora L T; Ng, Michael T",Psychiatry Res,,73

A month into inoculation of all frontline health professionals and other priority groups, the authors of this study gathered data on the sentiment of Filipinos regarding the Philippine government’s efforts using the social networking site Twitter. Natural language processing techniques were applied to understand the general sentiment, which can help the government in analyzing their response. The sentiments were annotated and trained using the Naïve Bayes model to classify English and Filipino language tweets into positive, neutral, and negative polarities through the RapidMiner data science software. The results yielded an 81.77% accuracy, which outweighs the accuracy of recent sentiment analysis studies using Twitter data from the Philippines.","Villavicencio, Charlyn Macrohon Julio Jerison Inbaraj X.

The model is applied specifically to COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus (aka""novel coronavirus""). The SIR (Susceptible - Infectious - Recovered) model is used as a basis for studying the evolution of the epidemic. Nevertheless, we have modified some of the model hypotheses in order to obtain an estimate of the contamination free of overestimated predictions. This extended model is then applied to the case of the recent advance of the epidemic in Brazil. In this regard, it is possible to obtain the evolution for the number of infectious significantly close to that provided by current data. Accordingly, we evaluate possible future scenarios for the disease spread. Regarding the population susceptibility, we consider different social behaviors in response to quarantine measures and precautions to avoid contagion. We conclude that the future scenario of the epidemic depends significantly on the social behavior adopted to date, as well as on the contagion control measures. The extent of such measures would be likely to cause thousands, millions or tens of millions of contaminations in the next few months.","Schulz, Rodrigo A.; Coimbra-Ara'ujo, Carlos H.; Costiche, Samuel W.

357556,The concept of the crown and its potential role in the downfall of coronavirus,2020,"COVID-19, a novel identified coronavirus disease due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection, has posed a significant threat to public health worldwide. It has been reported COVID-19 keeps substantial nucleotide similarity and shares common receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-Cov). Here, we investigated the gene expression of ACE2 and identified associated pathways of SARS-Cov as a useful reference for a deepening understanding of COVID-19. The results indicated the ACE2 was overexpressed in human airway epithelial cells (HAEs), especially at 72 h after SARS-Cov infection. We found ACE2 might regulate immune response through immunological activation-associated pathways in the process of in both SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov-2 infection, where the activation of B cells, macrophages, helper T cells 1 (Th1 cells) and the inhibition of Foxp3 + regulatory T (Treg) cells and CD8 + T cells were found to be prominent. Finally, significant correlation between ACE2 and JAK-STAT signaling pathway was identified which indicate that JAK-STAT signaling pathway might involve in the downstream action of the overactivation of ACE2. These findings are expected to gain a further insight into the action mechanism of COVID-19 infection and provide a promising target for designing effective therapeutic strategies.","Luo, Jing; Lu, Saisai; Yu, Mengjiao; Zhu, Lixia; Zhu, Chengwei; Li, Chenlu; Fang, Jinxia; Zhu, Xiaochun; Wang, Xiaobing",Gene,,73
360485,Risk for Transportation of Coronavirus Disease from Wuhan to Other Cities in China,2020,"Introduction: The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), a metabolic cascade regulating pressure and circulating blood volume, has been considered the main system involved in the pathogenesis of severe lung injury and organs decline in COVID-19 patients. The angio-tensin I-converting enzyme (ACE1), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensinogen (AGT) and receptors angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1) are key factors for SARS-CoV-2 entering in the cells, sodium and water retention with an increase blood pressure, promotion of fibrotic and inflammatory phenomena resulting in a cytokine storm. Methods: In this pilot study, the frequencies of six polymorphisms in the ACE1, ACE2, AGT and AGTR1 genes were analysed in symptomatic patients affected by COVID-19 and compared with the results obtained from asymptomatic subjects. Results: Thus, we have identified that rs2074192 (ACE2), rs1799752 (ACE1) and rs699 (AGT) SNPs could potentially be a valuable tool for predicting the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. A genetic predisposition may be prospected for severe internal organ damages and poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19 disease, as observed in symptomatic vs asymptomatic. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that analysis of RAAS polymorphisms could be considered the key point in understanding and predicting the SARS-CoV-2 course infection.","Cafiero, C.; Rosapepe, F.; Palmirotta, R.; Re, A.; Ottaiano, M.

This study proposes a fully automatic technique to design a face specific mask. Through the use of stereophotogrammetry, computer-assisted design and three-dimensional (3D) printing, we describe a protocol for manufacturing facemasks perfectly adapted to the individual face characteristics. The face specific mask was compared to a universal design of facemask and different filter container's designs were merged with the mask body. Subjective assessment of the face specific mask demonstrated tight closure at the nose, mouth and chin area, and permits the normal wearing of glasses. A screw-drive locking system is advised for easy assembly of the filter components. Automation of the process enables high volume production but still allows sufficient designer interaction to answer specific requirements. The suggested protocol can be used to provide more comfortable, effective and sustainable solution compared to a single use, standardized mask. Subsequent research on printing materials, sterilization technique and compliance with international regulations will facilitate the introduction of the face specific mask in clinical practice as well as for general use.","Shaheen, Eman; Willaert, Robin; Miclotte, Isabel; Coropciuc, Ruxandra; Bila, Michel; Politis, Constantinus",PLoS One,,73
365524,Long-term conditions and severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19),2020,"BACKGROUND: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread worldwide, and its associated stressors have resulted in decreased sleep quality among front-line workers. However, in China, the general public displayed more psychological problems than the front-line workers during the pandemic. Therefore, we investigated the influence of perceived stress on the sleep quality of the non-diseased general public and developed a moderated mediation model to explain said relationship. METHODS: Questionnaire-based surveys were conducted online from February 18-25, 2020 with 1630 Chinese participants (aged 18-68 years). RESULTS: Around one-third (36.38%) of participants were poor sleepers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, higher perceived stress was significantly associated with higher anxiety levels, which, in turn, was associated with lower sleep quality. Self-esteem moderated the indirect effect of perceived stress on sleep quality through its moderation of the effect of perceived stress on anxiety. This indicated that the mediation effect of anxiety was stronger in those with low levels of self-esteem than in those with high levels of self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that both the sleep quality and perceived stress levels of the non-diseased general public required attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also identify personality characteristics related to better sleep quality, demonstrating the important role of self-esteem in environmental adaptation.","Zhao, Xiaolin; Lan, Mengxue; Li, Huixiang; Yang, Juan",Sleep medicine,,73
366730,A family cluster of COVID-19 involving an asymptomatic case with persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 in anal swabs,2020,"Pentacyclic triterpenoids have wide applications in the pharmaceutical industry. The precise glucosylation at C-3 OH of pentacyclic triterpenoids mediated by uridine 5'-diphospho-glucosyltransferase (UDP-glucosyltransferase [UGT]) is an important way to produce valuable derivatives with various improved functions. However, most reported UGTs suffer from low regiospecificity toward the OH and COOH groups of pentacyclic triterpenoids, which significantly decreases the reaction efficiency. Here, two new UGTs (UGT73C33 and UGT73F24) were discovered in Glycyrrhiza uralensis. UGT73C33 showed high activity but poor regioselectivity toward the C-3 OH and C-30 COOH of pentacyclic triterpenoid, producing three glucosides. UGT73F24 showed rigid regioselectivity toward C-3 OH of typical pentacyclic triterpenoids producing only C-3 O-glucosylated derivatives. In addition, UGT73C33 and UGT73F24 showed a broad substrate scope toward typical flavonoids with various sugar donors. Next, the substrate recognition mechanism of UGT73F24 toward glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) and UDP-glucose was investigated. Two key residues, I23 and L84, were identified to determine activity, and site-directed mutagenesis of UGT73F24-I23G/L84N increased the activity by 4.1-fold. Furthermore, three in vitro GA glycosylation systems with UDP-recycling were constructed, and high yields of GA-3-O-Glc (1.25 mM), GA-30-O-Glc (0.61 mM), and GA-di-Glc (0.26 mM) were obtained. The de novo biosynthesis of GA-3-O-glucose (26.31 mg/L) was also obtained in engineered yeast.","Zhang, Liang; Ren, Shichao; Liu, Xiaofei; Liu, Xiaochen; Guo, Fang; Sun, Wentao; Feng, Xudong; Li, Chun",Biotechnol. bioeng,,73

In this paper, we draw these two strands of metaphoric framing and historical comparison together by identifying the metaphorical framings of past influenza pandemics in media and political discourse in the UK over an extended period (1890–2009). The findings show remarkable continuity in the choice and proportion of conceptual metaphor across very different sociohistorical contexts. However, this does not correspond to entrenchment of the metaphors which continue to be creative and elaborated in many cases. In terms of variation over time, the analysis shows shifts in framing with greater focus on societal effects and reactions to influenza in later periods while the agency of the virus is reduced. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Taylor, C.; Kidgell, J.","Discourse, Context and Media",,73

However, high-resolution cropland maps are not readily available for most countries, especially in regions dominated by smallholder farming (e.g., sub-Saharan Africa). These maps are especially critical in times of crisis when decision makers need to rapidly design and enact agriculture-related policies and mitigation strategies, including providing humanitarian assistance, dispersing targeted aid, or boosting productivity for farmers. A major challenge for developing crop maps is that many regions do not have readily accessible ground truth data on croplands necessary for training and validating predictive models, and field campaigns are not feasible for collecting labels for rapid response. We present a method for rapid mapping of croplands in regions where little to no ground data is available. We present results for this method in Togo, where we delivered a high-resolution (10 m) cropland map in under 10 days to facilitate rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the Togolese government.

404445,Prevalence and Longevity of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Among Healthcare Workers,2021,"BACKGROUND: Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may help to discover therapeutic targets. METHODS: To determine the metabolomic profile of circulating plasma from COVID-19 survivors with pulmonary sequelae 3 months after discharge, a random, outcome-stratified case-control sample was analyzed. We enrolled 103 recovered COVID-19 patients as well as 27 healthy donors, and performed pulmonary function tests, computerized tomography (CT) scans, laboratory examinations, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Plasma metabolite profiles of COVID-19 survivors with abnormal pulmonary function were evidently different from those of healthy donors or subjects with normal pulmonary function. These alterations were associated with disease severity and mainly involved amino acid, and glycerophospholipid metabolic pathways. Furthermore, increased levels of triacylglycerols, phosphatidylcholines, prostaglandin E2, arginine, and decreased levels of betain and adenosine were associated with pulmonary CO diffusing capacity and total lung capacity. The global plasma metabolomic profile differed between subjects with abnormal and normal pulmonary function. CONCLUSIONS: Further metabolite-based analysis may help to identify the mechanisms underlying pulmonary dysfunction in COVID-19 survivors, and provide potential therapeutic targets in the future.","Xu, Juanjuan; Zhou, Mei; Luo, Ping; Yin, Zhengrong; Wang, Sufei; Liao, Tingting; Yang, Fan; Wang, Zhen; Yang, Dan; Peng, Yi; Geng, Wei; Li, Yunyun; Zhang, Hui; Yang, Jin",Clin. infect. dis,,73

Methods: SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase protein was targeted in this study. Autodock Vina software and Python script were used to realize high-throughput molecular docking. Combined with “ADME-Lipinski” rules, the re-screening was carried out to optimize the active ingredients and speculate the key TCMs and compound prescriptions. Based on the perspective of network pharmacology, a component-target-pathway network was constructed to infer the mechanism of action of core drug pairs. Results: Taking the reference ligand as positive control, 66 natural micromolecule compounds with good pharmacokinetic properties were obtained. Twelve single TCMs, two Chinese medicine pairs of Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma-Mori Cortex and Lonicerae Japonicae Flos-Forsythiae Fructus, and 12 TCM prescriptions including Sangju Drink and modified Sangju Drink and Yinqiao Powder were selected as candidate schemes to fight against novel coronavirus pneumonia. Conclusion: This study is based on high-throughput molecular docking technology to virtually screen small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase of CMM and Chinese medicines, innovatively analyze the potential molecular mechanism in combination with network pharmacology, and provide scientific guidance and theoretical basis for TCM to resist novel coronavirus pneumonia.","Ma, Qing-Yun; Liu, Chen; Du, Hai-Tao; Zhang, Gui-Sheng; Yan, Bin; Sun, Qi-Hui; Liu, Xiao-Yun; Qi, Dong-Mei; Yang, Yong; Rong, Rong",Chin.

Subject and methods: In the period March 20-30, 2020, we collected data on COVID-19-related knowledge, awareness and adoption of preventive practices, depression and anxiety (Patient Health Questionnaire-4), stress (Impact of Event Scale-6), pessimism, and tobacco and alcohol use. Differences between age groups (18-39 years, 40-59 years and &#8805; 60 years) were tested using Pearson's chi-squared tests or ANOVAs; associations between drinking and smoking and depression, anxiety, and stress were tested using adjusted logistic regression models. Results: Approximately half of the sample (N Total = 6391) were 50-69 years old and 58% were female. COVID-19 knowledge (mean = 12.0; SD = 1.2) and protective practice awareness (mean = 9.1; SD = 0.8) were high. Among respondents, 44% had a score consistent with depression and anxiety (PHQ-4 score &#8805; 6), and 52% reported high stress scores (&#8805; median of 1.33). COVID-19-related anxiety and depression were associated with increased drinking (AOR = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.49, 2.15) and smoking (AOR = 2.17; 95% CI = 1.64, 2.88). High stress scores were also associated with increased drinking (AOR = 1.80; 95% CI = 1.49, 2.17, p < 0.001) and smoking (AOR = 1.75; 95% CI = 1.31, 2.33). Conclusions: In spite of high knowledge levels, important gaps were identified. High prevalence of poor mental health outcomes and associated increases in drinking and smoking warrant ongoing risk communications tailoring to effectively disseminate information and expanding psychosocial services, particularly via telehealth, to mitigate the negative mental health impact of COVID-19.

412095,SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination During Pregnancy: A Complex Decision,2021,"Feline coronaviruses (FCoV) are members of the alphacoronavirus genus that are further characterized by serotype (types I and II) based on the antigenicity of the spike (S) protein and by pathotype based on the associated clinical conditions. Feline enteric coronaviruses (FECV) are associated with the vast majority of infections and are typically asymptomatic. Within individual animals, FECV can mutate and cause a severe and usually fatal disease called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), the leading infectious cause of death in domestic cat populations. There are no approved antiviral drugs or recommended vaccines to treat or prevent FCoV infection. The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) traditionally employed to assess immune responses and to screen therapeutic and vaccine candidates is time-consuming, low-throughput, and typically requires 2-3 days for the formation and manual counting of cytolytic plaques. Host cells are capable of carrying heavy viral burden in the absence of visible cytolytic effects, thereby reducing the sensitivity of the assay. In addition, operator-to-operator variation can generate uncertainty in the results and digital records are not automatically created. To address these challenges we developed a novel high-throughput viral microneutralization assay, with quantification of virus-infected cells performed in a plate-based image cytometer. Host cell seeding density, microplate surface coating, virus concentration and incubation time, wash buffer and fluorescent labeling were optimized. Subsequently, this FCoV viral neutralization assay was used to explore immune correlates of protection using plasma from naturally FECV-infected cats. We demonstrate that the high-throughput viral neutralization assay using the Celigo Image Cytometer provides a robust and efficient method for the rapid screening of therapeutic antibodies, antiviral compounds, and vaccines. This method can be applied to various viral infectious diseases to accelerate vaccine and antiviral drug discovery and development.","Pearson, Morgan; LaVoy, Alora; Chan, Leo Li-Ying; Dean, Gregg A",J Virol Methods,,73
415447,Lack of complications in patients with eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak,2020,"The author's experience caring for a patient with COVID-19 whose condition deteriorated rapidly into a critical illness in the negative pressure room of the intensive care unit is described in this article. The onset of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome led this patient to receive endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation and subsequent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for life support. He was isolated in the negative air pressure room in the intensive care unit for infection control for this emerging respiratory infectious disease. This patient was also confronted with emotional pressures arising from the general uncertainty regarding the progress of this novel disease and from being isolated from the outside world. The care period was from April 5th to May 12th, 2020. The data was collected through direct care, written conversations, physical communication, observation, medical record reviews, diagnosis reports, and nursing assessments of physical, psychological, social, and spiritual distress. The health problems of this patient were identified as gas exchange disorder, infection, anxiety, and other problems. Our chest physiotherapy team comprised nurses, physicians, and respiratory therapists. After administering individualized treatments, including monitoring vital signs and installing an external life support system, the lung consolidation and lung collapse problems of the patient improved, allowing the ventilator to be removed. To address the patient's psychological problems, we used a humanoid diagram and whiteboard drawing as communication tools to explain to the patient the reasons for and functions of the different tubes on his body to reduce his anxiety and maintain the safe use of these tubes. Moreover, bedside care was replaced by mobile phone video and phone calls, allowing the patient to communicate with family members, which reduced his isolation-related anxiety and enhanced his compliance with treatment and care protocols. This experience supports the benefit of installing two-way video devices and viewing monitors in negative pressure rooms in the ICU to facilitate effective communications between patients, patient family members, and the medical team to reduce patient-perceived anxiety and social isolation. This case report provides a reference demonstrating a patient-centered caring model for treating COVID-19 patients in the ICU.","Wang, Yo-Ping; Chuang, Pao-Yu; Gone, Shu-Ing; Tseng, Chi-Ying",Hu Li Za Zhi,,73

418793,The Challenging Diagnosis of Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Associated with Sars-Cov-2 Infection-Two Case Reports and Literature Review,2021,"BACKGROUND: Previously reported increases in serum levels of vasodilating neuropeptides pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide-38 (PACAP38) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) during attacks of cluster headache could indicate their involvement in cluster headache attack initiation. We investigated the attack-inducing effects of PACAP38 and vasoactive intestinal peptide in cluster headache, hypothesising that PACAP38, but not vasoactive intestinal peptide, would induce cluster-like attacks in episodic active phase and chronic cluster headache patients. METHODS: In a double-blind crossover study, 14 episodic cluster headache patients in active phase, 15 episodic cluster headache patients in remission phase and 15 chronic cluster headache patients were randomly allocated to receive intravenous infusion of PACAP38 (10 pmol/kg/min) or vasoactive intestinal peptide (8 pmol/kg/min) over 20 min on two study days separated by at least 7 days. We recorded headache intensity, incidence of cluster-like attacks, cranial autonomic symptoms and vital signs using a questionnaire (0-90 min). RESULTS: In episodic cluster headache active phase, PACAP38 induced cluster-like attacks in 6/14 patients and vasoactive intestinal peptide induced cluster-like attacks in 5/14 patients (p = 1.000). In chronic cluster headache, PACAP38 and vasoactive intestinal peptide both induced cluster-like attacks in 7/15 patients (p = 0.765). In episodic cluster headache remission phase, neither PACAP38 nor vasoactive intestinal peptide induced cluster-like attacks. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our hypothesis, attack induction was lower than expected and roughly equal by PACAP38 and vasoactive intestinal peptide in episodic active phase and chronic cluster headache patients, which contradicts the PAC1-receptor as being solely responsible for attack induction.Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov (identifier NCT03814226).","Vollesen, Anne Luise H; Snoer, Agneta; Chaudhry, Basit; Petersen, Anja Sofie; Hagedorn, Andreas; Hoffmann, Jan; Jensen, Rigmor H; Ashina, Messoud",Cephalalgia,,73

Considering the possibility of dilution factor in pool testing, an attempt was made to find out possibility of any true positive sample/s in pools with late amplification. METHODS: The study was conducted on samples received from various collection centres in different districts of Odisha as well as from patients attending the screening clinic or admitted in COVID ward of the hospital. Nasal/nasopharyngeal/throat swabs received in viral transport media in cold chain were subjected to RT-PCR testing in a Biosafety Laboratory level-2 by including uniform volume of 4 units (samples) per pool. All confirmed and probable positive pools in screening assay were de-convoluted and individual samples tested for confirmatory assay. RESULT: Inclusion of an additional criteria of probable positive pool (Ct value >35 with non-sigmoid amplification curve or showing a line of amplification towards the end of the cycle) yielded 39 (15.5%) more true positive samples out of a total of 251 positive samples that would otherwise have been missed if only the classical criteria of positive (Ct within 35 with proper sigmoid curve) had been considered. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the importance of considering any indication of late amplification in the RT-PCR test to label a pool as positive to avoid missing any true positive sample in the pool.

439004,Patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II type I receptor blockers: higher risks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection but milder clinical manifestations?,2020,"When test resources are scarce and infection prevalence is low, testing groups of individuals can be more efficient than testing individuals. This can be done by pooling individual samples (in groups, and only test those groups for the presence of a pathogen. The rationale is that if prevalence is low, many of these groups will ideally test negative, clearing all all individuals from such groups, whereas individuals appearing in (ideally few) positive groups will require further screening. Forming those groups in order to minimize testing costs while maintaining good detection is the goal of group testing algorithms. We propose a new framework to form such groups that takes into account various constraints of the testing environment, and which can easily incorporate individualized infection priors. Our solution solves a Bayesian sequential experimental design problem: Given previous group test results, we sample the posterior distribution of infection status vectors using sequential Monte Carlo samplers; these samples are then fed to an optimizer, which seeks to form groups that maximize an information gain if those future tests were to be known. To output marginal probabilities of infection, we use loopy belief propagation as a decoder. We show a significant empirical improvement over individualized tests in simulations: our G-MIMAX test procedure has an average specificity/sensitivity that significantly exceeds that of other baselines, including individual tests, as long as the disease prevalence $\leq 5\%$.","Cuturi, Marco; Teboul, Olivier; Vert, Jean-Philippe",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12508v4.pdf,73

One of the most dangerous consequences of the prothrombotic imbalance is the increased incidence of micro- and macrothrombotic phenomena, especially deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). METHODS: We investigated the correlation between radiological and clinical-biochemical characteristics in a cohort of hospitalised COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: PE was confirmed in 14/61 (23%) patients, five (35.7%) had DVT. The radiographic findings, quantified by Qanadli score calculated on CT angiography, correlated with the clinical score and biochemical markers. The ratio between the right and left ventricle diameter measured at CT angiography correlated with the length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: In our cohort radiological parameters showed a significant correlation with clinical prognostic indices and scores, thus suggesting that a multidisciplinary approach is advisable in the evaluation of PE in COVID-19 patients.","Wu, Maddalena Alessandra; Colombo, Riccardo; Arquati, Massimo; Ippolito, Sonia; Taino, Alba; Ruggiero, Diego; Tonelli, Francesca; Trombetta, Lucia; Facchinetti, Pietro; Glielmo, Pierluigi; Cogliati, Chiara; Flor, Nicola",Int J Clin Pract,,73

The pandemic brought into light structural weaknesses of the health system, including its governance and decision-making process, but also provoked changes that helped to improve its resilience. We analyse the French experience of Covid-19 in 2020 by critically reviewing major policy measures implemented during the first two waves of the pandemic. France has struggled to find the right balance between the rock of economic and social damage caused by containment measures and the hard alternative of a rapidly spreading pandemic. The response to the first wave, including a full lock-down, was an emergency response that revealed the low level of preparedness for pandemics and the overly hospital-centred provision of health care in France. During the second wave, this response evolved into a more level strategy trying to reconcile health needs in a broader perspective integrating socio-economic considerations, but without fully managing to put in place an effective health strategy. We conclude that to achieve the right balance, France will have to strengthen health system capacity and improve the cooperation between actors at central and local levels with greater participatory decision-making that takes into account local-level realities and the diversity of needs.","Or, Zeynep; Gandré, Coralie; Durand Zaleski, Isabelle; Steffen, Monika",Health Econ Policy Law,,73

458787,A case-control approach to an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 on an acute stroke unit in the U.S,2020,"Autoimmune diseases and infections are often closely intertwined. Patients with autoimmune diseases are more susceptible to infections due to either active autoimmune disease or the medications used to treat them. Based on infections as environmental triggers of autoimmunity, an autoimmune response would also be expected in COVID-19. Although some studies have shown the occurance of autoantibodies and the possible development of autoimmune diseases after SARS-CoV-2 infection, current data suggest that the levels of autoantibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection is comparable to that of some other known infections and that the autoantibodies might only be transient. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with a systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD) appears slightly higher compared to the general population and the course of COVID-19 disease does not seem to be very different, however, specific therapies such as glucocorticoids and anti-TNF might modulate the risk of hospitalization/death. Cytokine release syndrome is a severe complication in COVID-19. Many drugs used for the treatment of SARD are directly or indirectly targeting cytokines involved in the cytokine release syndrome, therefore it has been suggested that they could also be effective in COVID-19, but more evidence on the use of these medications for the treatment of COVID-19 is currently being collected.","Lakota, Katja; Perdan-Pirkmajer, Katja; Hocevar, Alojzija; Sodin-Semrl, Snezna; Rotar, Ziga; Cucnik, Sasa; Zigon, Polona",Front Immunol,,73

A Case-Control Approach to an Outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 on an Acute Stroke Unit in the U.S,2020,"AIMS: Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a unique antioxidant that can eradicate different kinds of free radicals. The current trial was designed to investigate the effects of ALA supplementation on some oxidative stress biomarkers in women with GDM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty women with GDM at 24-28 weeks of pregnancy were selected and then they were divided into the drug (n = 30) received ALA 300 mg/day for 8 weeks and the placebo (n = 30) groups. Serum values of fasting blood sugar (FBS), thiol groups, glutathione, catalase, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant status (TOS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured. Values of the oxidative stress index (OSI), the MDA/TAC ratio and total antioxidant gap (TAG) were calculated. RESULTS: After the intervention values of FBS (p = .001), TAC (p < .001), OSI (p = .003), TAG (p = .001) and catalase (p < .001) were improved significantly in the drug group. Values of TOS (p = .070) and glutathione (p = .088) were improved marginally in the drug group. CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed that ALA supplementation at a dosage of 300 mg/day in women with GDM had improving effects on maternal circulating values of FBS, TAC, OSI, TAG, TOS, glutathione and catalase.","Mandani, Masoome; Badehnoosh, Bita; Jalali-Mashayekhi, Farideh; Tavakoli-Far, Bahareh; Khosrowbeygi, Ali",Gynecol Endocrinol,,73
458901,Pediatric Multisystemic Inflammatory Syndrome Associated With SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 or COVID-19 has been declared as a pandemic disease by the World Health Organization (WHO). Globally, this disease affected 159 million of the population and reported ~ 3.3 million deaths to the current date (May 2021). There is no definitive treatment strategy that has been identified, although this disease has prevailed in its current form for the past 18 months. The main challenges in the (SARS-CoV)-2 infections are in identifying the heterogeneity in viral strains and the plausible mechanisms of viral infection to human tissues. In parallel to the investigations into the patho-mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection, understanding the fundamental processes underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is very crucial for designing effective therapies. Since neurological symptoms are very apparent in COVID-19 infected patients, here, we tried to emphasize the involvement of redox imbalance and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction in the progression of the COVID-19 infection. It has been articulated that mitochondrial dysfunction is very apparent and also interlinked to neurological symptoms in COVID-19 infection. Overall, this article provides an in-depth overview of redox imbalance and mitochondrial dysfunction involvement in aggravating COVID-19 infection and its probable contribution to the neurological manifestation of the disease.","Kaundal, Ravinder K; Kalvala, Anil K; Kumar, Ashutosh",Mol.

Most postmortem studies to date reveal diffuse alveolar damage as the most relevant histologic pattern. Antemortem lung biopsy may however provide more precise data regarding the earlier stages of the disease, providing a basis for novel treatment approaches. OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the morphological and immunohistochemical features of lung samples obtained in patients with moderate Covid-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy was carried out in 12 Covid-19 patients within 20 days of symptom onset. RESULTS: Histopathologic changes included spots of patchy acute lung injury with alveolar type II cell hyperplasia, with no evidence of hyaline membranes. Strong nuclear expression of phosphorylated STAT3 was observed in >50% of AECII. Interalveolar capillaries showed enlarged lumen and were in part arranged in superposed rows. Pulmonary venules were characterized by luminal enlargement, thickened walls, and perivascular CD4+ T-cell infiltration. A strong nuclear expression of phosphorylated STAT3, associated with PD-L1 and IDO expression, was observed in endothelial cells of venules and interstitial capillaries. Alveolar spaces macrophages exhibited a peculiar phenotype (CD68, CD11c, CD14, CD205, CD206, CD123/IL3AR, and PD-L1). CONCLUSIONS: Morphologically distinct features were identified in early stages of Covid-19 pneumonia, with epithelial and endothelial cell abnormalities different from either classical interstitial lung diseases or diffuse alveolar damage. Alveolar type II cell hyperplasia was a prominent event in the majority of cases. Inflammatory cells expressed peculiar phenotypes. No evidence of hyaline membranes and endothelial changes characterized by IDO expression might in part explain the compliance and the characteristic pulmonary vasoplegia observed in less-advanced Covid-19 pneumonia.","Doglioni, Claudio; Ravaglia, Claudia; Chilosi, Marco; Rossi, Giulio; Dubini, Alessandra; Pedica, Federica; Piciucchi, Sara; Vizzuso, Antonio; Stella, Franco; Maitan, Stefano; Agnoletti, Vanni; Puglisi, Silvia; Poletti, Giovanni; Sambri, Vittorio; Pizzolo, Giovanni; Bronte, Vincenzo; Wells, Athol U; Poletti, Venerino",Respiration,,73

476349,Prevalence and Characteristics of Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection in the United States: A Multicenter Cohort Study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Thrombosis and pulmonary embolism appear to be major causes of mortality in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, few studies have focused on the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after hospitalization for COVID-19. METHODS: In this multi-center study, we followed 1529 COVID-19 patients for at least 45 days after hospital discharge, who underwent routine telephone follow-up. In case of signs or symptoms of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), they were invited for an in-hospital visit with a pulmonologist. The primary outcome was symptomatic VTE within 45 days of hospital discharge. RESULTS: Of 1529 COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital, a total of 228 (14.9%) reported potential signs or symptoms of PE or DVT and were seen for an in-hospital visit. Of these, 13 and 12 received Doppler ultrasounds or pulmonary CT angiography, respectively, of whom only one patient was diagnosed with symptomatic PE. Of 51 (3.3%) patients who died after discharge, two deaths were attributed to VTE corresponding to a 45-day cumulative rate of symptomatic VTE of 0.2% (95%CI 0.1%-0.6%; n = 3). There was no evidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in these patients. Other deaths after hospital discharge included myocardial infarction (n = 13), heart failure (n = 9), and stroke (n = 9). CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe a high rate of symptomatic VTE in COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge. Routine extended thromboprophylaxis after hospitalization for COVID-19 may not have a net clinical benefit. Randomized trials may be warranted.","Rashidi, Farid; Barco, Stefano; Kamangar, Farin; Heresi, Gustavo A; Emadi, Ashkan; Kaymaz, Cihangir; Jansa, Pavel; Reis, Abilio; Rashidi, Arash; Taghizadieh, Ali; Rezaeifar, Parisa; Moghimi, Minoosh; Ghodrati, Samad; Mozafari, Abolfazl; Foumani, Ali Alavi; Tahamtan, Ouria; Rafiee, Effat; Abbaspour, Zahra; Khodadadi, Kasra; Alamdari, Golsa; Boodaghi, Yasman; Rezaei, Maryam; Muhammadi, Muhammad Javad; Abbasi, Meysam; Movaseghi, Fatemeh; Koohi, Ata; Shakourzad, Leila; Ebrahimi, Fatemeh; Radvar, Sarvin; Amoozadeh, Maryam; Fereidooni, Fatemeh; Naseari, Hanieh; Movalled, Kobra; Ghorbani, Ozra; Ansarin, Khalil",Thromb Res,,73

MethodsOnline video or telephone semi-structured interviews took place between December 2020 and April 2021. They were audio recorded and transcribed, and analyzed using a combination of inductive and deductive thematic analysis techniques. ResultsScientists found working on the advisory boards during the COVID-19 pandemic to be a rewarding experience. However, they identified numerous challenges including learning to work in an interdisciplinary way, ensuring that evidence is understood and taken on board by governments, and dealing with media and public reactions. Scientists found themselves taking on new roles, the boundaries of which were not clearly defined. Consequently, they received substantial media attention and were often perceived and treated as a public figure. ConclusionsScientists working on advisory boards in European countries faced similar challenges, highlighting key lessons to be learnt.

This global pandemic is now calling for efforts to develop more effective COVID-19 therapies. Here we use a host-directed approach, which focuses on cellular responses to diverse small-molecule treatments, to identify potentially effective drugs for COVID-19. This framework looks at the ability of compounds to elicit a similar transcriptional response to IFN-ß, a type I interferon that fails to be induced at notable levels in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. By correlating the perturbation profiles of ~3,000 small molecules with a high-quality signature of IFN-ß-responsive genes in primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells, our analysis revealed four candidate COVID-19 compounds, namely homoharringtonine, narciclasine, anisomycin, and emetine. We experimentally confirmed that the predicted compounds significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells at nanomolar, relatively non-toxic concentrations, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 165.7 nM, 16.5 nM, and 31.4 nM for homoharringtonine, narciclasine, and anisomycin, respectively. Together, our results corroborate a host-centric strategy to inform protective antiviral therapies for COVID-19.","Huang, Chen-Tsung; Chao, Tai-Ling; Kao, Han-Chieh; Pang, Yu-Hao; Lee, Wen-Hau; Hsieh, Chiao-Hui; Chang, Sui-Yuan; Huang, Hsuan-Cheng; Juan, Hsueh-Fen",Heliyon,,73

It is also unclear which pathways are contributing to complement activation in COVID-19, and if complement activation is associated with certain features of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as endothelial injury and hypercoagulability. To address these questions, we investigated complement activation in the plasma from patients with COVID-19 prospectively enrolled at two tertiary care centers: Washington University School of Medicine (n=134) and Yale School of Medicine (n=49). We compared our patients to two non-COVID cohorts: (a) patients hospitalized with influenza (n=54), and (b) patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV, n=22). We demonstrate that circulating markers of complement activation are elevated in patients with COVID-19 compared to those with influenza and to patients with non-COVID-19 respiratory failure. Further, the results facilitate distinguishing those who are at higher risk of worse outcomes such as requiring ICU admission, or IMV. Moreover, the results indicate enhanced activation of the alternative complement pathway is most prevalent in patients with severe COVID-19 and is associated with markers of endothelial injury (i.e., angiopoietin-2) as well as hypercoagulability (i.e., thrombomodulin and von Willebrand factor). Our findings identify complement activation to be a distinctive feature of COVID-19, and provide specific targets that may be utilized for risk prognostication, drug discovery and personalized clinical trials.","Ma, L.; Sahu, S.

524174,If at first you do not succeed. Repeat SARS-COV2 PCR testing,2020,"Recent advances in 3D printing have led to a rise in the use of 3D printed materials in prosthetics and external medical devices. These devices, while inexpensive, have not been adequately studied for their ability to resist biofouling and biofilm buildup. Bacterial biofilms are a major cause of biofouling in the medical field and, therefore, hospital-acquired, and medical device infections. These surface-attached bacteria are highly recalcitrant to conventional antimicrobial agents and result in chronic infections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and medical officials have considered 3D printed medical devices as alternatives to conventional devices, due to manufacturing shortages. This abundant use of 3D printed devices in the medical fields warrants studies to assess the ability of different microorganisms to attach and colonize to such surfaces. In this study, we describe methods to determine bacterial biofouling and biofilm formation on 3D printed materials. We explored the biofilm-forming ability of multiple opportunistic pathogens commonly found on the human body including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus to colonize eight commonly used polylactic acid (PLA) polymers. Biofilm quantification, surface topography, digital optical microscopy, and 3D projections were employed to better understand the bacterial attachment to 3D printed surfaces. We found that biofilm formation depends on surface structure, hydrophobicity, and that there was a wide range of antimicrobial properties among the tested polymers. We compared our tested materials with commercially available antimicrobial PLA polymers.","Hall, D. C.; Jr.,; Palmer, P.; Ji, H. F.; Ehrlich, G. D.; Krol, J. E.",Frontiers in Microbiology,,73
589984,Approaching the interpretation of discordances in SARS-CoV-2 testing,2021-03-23,"SARS-CoV-2-pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Unfortunately, there is lack of evidence about the optimal management of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), even less in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) therapy than in the general population. In this retrospective observational single-center study we analyzed the clinical course and outcomes of all MHD patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 12(th) to April 10(th), 2020 as confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction. Baseline features, clinical course, laboratory data, and different therapies were compared between survivors and non-survivors to identify risk factors associated with mortality. Among the 36 patients, 11 (30.5%) died and 7 could be discharged within the observation period. Clinical and radiological evolution during the first week of admission were predictive of mortality. Among the 36 patients, 18 had worsening of their clinical status, as defined by severe hypoxia with oxygen therapy requirements greater than 4 Liters/minute and radiological worsening. Significantly 11 out of those 18 patients (61.1%) died. None of the classical cardiovascular risk factors in the general population were associated with higher mortality. However, a longer time on hemodialysis (hazard ratio 1.008(95% confidence interval 1.001-1.015) per year), increased LDH levels (1.006(1.001-1.011), and lower lymphocyte count (0.996 (0.992-1.000) one week after clinical onset were all significantly associated with higher mortality risk. Thus, the mortality among hospitalized hemodialysis patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is high. Lymphopenia and increased LDH levels were associated with poor prognosis.","Goicoechea., Marian; Sánchez Cámara, Luis Alberto; Macías, Nicolás; Muñoz de Morales, Alejandra; González Rojas, Ángela; Bascuñana, Arturo; Arroyo, David; Vega, Almudena; Abad, Soraya; Verde, Eduardo; García Prieto, Ana María; Verdalles, Ursula; Barbieri, Diego; Felipe Delgado, Andrés; Carbayo, Javier; Mijaylova, Antonia; Pérez de José, Ana; Melero, Rosa; Tejedor, Alberto; Rodriguez Benitez, Patrocinio; de José, Ana Pérez; Rodriguez Ferrero, Maria Luisa; Anaya, Fernando; Rengel, Manuel; Barraca, Daniel; Luño, José; Aragoncillo, Inés",Kidney Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32437770/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2020.04.031; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0085253820305093; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253820305093?v=s5,73

Since then, numerous measures have been taken to bring the infection under control. This was very successful in the spring of 2020, while the number of infections rose sharply the following autumn. To predict the occurrence of infections, epidemiological models are used. These are in principle a very valuable tool in pandemic management. However, they still partly need to be based on assumptions regarding the transmission routes and possible drivers of the infection dynamics. Despite numerous individual approaches, systematic epidemiological data are still lacking with which, for example, the effectiveness of individual measures could be quantified. Such information generated in studies is needed to enable reliable predictions regarding the further course of the pandemic. Thereby, the complexity of the models could develop hand in hand with the complexity of the available data. In this article, after delineating two basic classes of models, the contribution of epidemiological models to the assessment of various central aspects of the pandemic, such as the reproduction rate, the number of unreported cases, infection fatality rate, and the consideration of regionality, is shown. Subsequently, the use of the models to quantify the impact of measures and the effects of the “test–trace–isolate” strategy is described. In the concluding discussion, the limitations of such modelling approaches are juxtaposed with their advantages.","Priesemann, Viola; Meyer-Hermann, Michael; Pigeot, Iris; Schöbel, Anita",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34328524/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00103-021-03390-1,73

592046,Social Distancing and Artful Pandemic Survival,2020-11-11,"BACKGROUND: In the pandemic time, many low- and middle-income countries are experiencing restricted access to COVID-19 vaccines. An access to imported vaccines or ways to produce them locally becomes the principal source of hope. But developing a strategy for success in obtaining and allocating vaccines is not easy task. The governments in those countries have faced difficult decision whether to accept or reject offers of vaccine diplomacy, weighing price and availability of COVID-19 vaccines against concerns over their efficacy and safety. Our aim was to analyze public opinion regarding the governmental strategies to obtain COVID-19 vaccines in three Central Asian countries, focusing particularly on possible ethical issues. METHODS: We searched opinions expressed either in Russian or in the respective national languages. We provided data of the debate within three countries, drawn from social media postings and other sources. The opinion data was not restricted by source and time. This allowed to collect a wide range of possible opinions that could be expressed regarding COVID-19 vaccine supply and public’s participation in vaccine trials. We recognized ethical issues and possible questions concerning different ethical frameworks. We also considered additional information or scientific data, in the process of reasoning. RESULTS: As a result, public views on their respective government policies on COVID-19 vaccine supply ranged from strongly negative to slightly positive. We extracted most important issues from public debates, for our analysis. The first issue involved trade-offs between quantity, speed, price, freedom, efficacy and safety in the vaccines. The second set of issues arouse in connection with the request to site a randomized trial in one of countries (Uzbekistan). After considering additional evidences, we weighed individual with public risks and benefits to make specffic judgements concerning every issue. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that our analysis would be a helpful example of solving ethical issues that can rise concerning COVID-19 vaccine supply round the world. The public view can be highly critical, helping to spot such issues. An ignoring this view can lead to major problems, which in turn, can become a serious obstacle for the vaccine coverage and epidemics’ control in the countries and regions.","Aripov, Timur; Wikler, Daniel; Asadov, Damin; Tulekov, Zhangir; Murzabekova, Totugul; Munir, Kerim",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-745691/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34341787/,73
592061,Coronavirus Occurrence in the HIVE Cohort of Michigan Households: Reinfection frequency and serologic responses to seasonal and SARS coronaviruses,2021-03-23,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), has been associated with higher fatality rate among elderly patients (pts). In pts >60 years (y), “early prediction for adverse outcome” is central to adopt therapeutic strategies to mitigate mortality. Multiorgan, but specifically, respiratory failure is associated with aging and known comorbid conditions [i.e obesity, cardiovascular disease]. Previous reports suggest that innate immunity effectors [i.e neutrophils and lymphocytes] “readapt” during acute infection. During acute COVID-19 infection, neutrophilia/lymphopenia are linked to “deregulated” cytokines, a phenomenon that seems to be associate with disease severity. In this study, we seek to investigate the predictive role of peripheral blood count modifications [absolute neutrophil (ANC), lymphocyte (ALC) and monocyte (AMC) counts], in risk evaluation for life-threatening COVID-19 among elderly pts. Methods: After IRB approval, 104 pts admitted at Baylor St Luke’s Medical Center with confirmed COVID-19 PCR between April-June 2020 were selected for analysis. 66/104 (63.4%) pts were older than 60 y. In elderly pts, disease severity was estimated according to the World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China guidelines (mild vs severe vs life-threatening). To detect at diagnosis differential ANC, ALC and AMC expression, cases were categorized into mild/severe (censor=0) vs life-threatening (censor=1). Student’s t-test and chi-square analysis for continuous and categorical variables were performed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis including: (1) Hemopoietic factors [ANC, ALC, AMC] and (2) comorbid/inflammatory [CRP, body mass index (BMI), Charlson score] were obtained. SAS software was used for analysis. Results: 27/66 (40.9%) and 39/66 (50.09%) pts were mild/severe vs life-threatening COVID-19 disease. For mild/severe vs life-threatening disease, median age, BMI, Charlson comorbid score, were 68 vs 71 y, p=0.78; 27.7 vs 30, p=0.09; 5.40 vs 5.69, p=0.68, respectively. ANC, ALC, AMC, IL6 and CRP were 3.98 K/UL vs 6.79 K/uL, p=0.008; 0.90 K/UL vs 0.66 K/uL, p=0.01; 0.54 K/uL vs 0.43 K/uL, p=0.01; 43.2 vs 187.3, p=0.02; 10.1 vs 17.8, p=0.0001, for patients with mild/severe vs life-threatening disease (Fig 1). On univariate analysis, predictive variables for life-threatening disease were higher ANC (OR=1.24[1.02-1.49], p=0.02); lower ALC (OR=0.21[0.05-0.8], p=0.02), lower AMC (OR=0.11[0.01-0.86], p=0.03), and higher CRP (OR=1.19 [1.07-1.32], p=0.001). In multivariate analysis considering hemopoietic parameters, higher ANC (OR=1.53 [1.17-2.01], p=0.001) and lower AMC (OR=0.01 [0.001-0.28], p=0.006) retained predictive value. “Detectable evidence at diagnosis” for higher ANC, low AMC and ALC (3/3 hemopoietic factors) was discriminative for life-threatening COVID-19 disease (3 vs those with <3 factors, 100% vs 50%. Likelihood ratio= 7.73, p=0.01). A cutoff of 5.58 K/UL, 0.22 K/uL, 0.66 K/uL were associated severity prediction with sensitivity of 73.6%, 76.3%, 81.4% for ANC, AMC and ALC, respectively. Conclusions: In elderly COVID-19 pts exhibiting elevated CRP, a combination of high ANC, low monocyte and lymphocyte count is predictive for adverse COVID-19 outcome. Recent evidence suggests that monocytes “redistribute” from peripheral blood into the lungs to participate in tissue injury. Our data suggests that neutrophils/monocytes/lymphocytes induce differential “early signature” with ability for prediction of life-threatening disease. This signature may assist in identifying pts necessitating risk-adaptive interventions such as steroids, biologic agents and/or novel anti-inflammatory strategies.

594617,Antimicrobial management of respiratory infections in SARS-CoV-2 patients: Clinical and ASP conundrums,2020-10-26,"Background Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), characterized by overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines in the course of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been suggested as the major cause of mortality. Tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against human IL-6 receptor, poses a therapeutic option for the treatment of CRS leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome in coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods We performed a single-center retrospective study to reveal the outcome of COVID-19 patients on tocilizumab and proposed “the Cerrahpaşa-PREDICT score”, a new clinical scoring system using clinical and laboratory parameters that would help predicting the 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients receiving tocilizumab. Results Eighty-seven patients (median age: 59 years) were included of whom 75.8% were male. Tocilizumab use significantly improved clinical and laboratory parameters. The 28-day mortality rate on tocilizumab was 16.1%. The Cerrahpaşa-PREDICT score, consisting of platelet counts, procalcitonin, D-dimer levels, SO2R and the time from symptom onset to tocilizumab administration had a positive predictive value of 94.5% and negative predictive value of 92.9% for anticipating 28-day mortality. Conclusions Severe COVID-19 should closely be monitored for the signs of hyperinflammation. We showed that administration of tocilizumab early in the course of the disease (prior to ICU admission) resulted in a favorable outcome. Close monitoring usually aids identifying patients who would benefit from tocilizumab. In this regard, the Cerrahpaşa-PREDICT score might serve as a practical tool for estimating the 28-day mortality in COVID-19 patients who received tocilizumab and would facilitate timely recognition of fatal cases to be evaluated for other therapeutic options.","Eşkazan, Ahmet Emre; Balkan, İlker İnanç; Demirbaş, Kaan Can; Ar, Muhlis Cem; Karaali, Rıdvan; Sekibağ, Yonca; Mulamahmutoğlu, Sait; Dumanlı, Güleren Yartaş; Çakmak, Fatih; Yurttaş, Nurgül Özgür; Kurt, Furkan; Kurt, Seda Aladağ; Kuşkucu, Mert; Ürkmez, Seval; Börekçi, Şermin; Saribal, Devrim; Mete, Bilgül; Bavunoğlu, Işıl; Dikmen, Yalım; Aygün, Gökhan; Midilli, Kenan; Tabak, Fehmi",J Infect Chemother,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2021.05.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X21001367; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34120824/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X21001367?v=s5,73

Due to the mutations, the virus evolves at a rapid pace that helps them to survive better inside the host. One of the hotspots of pharmacological interventions is to inhibit binding of virus with the host cells, which is mediated by Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptors present on the human cells. This study was conducted with an aim to identify and characterise the mutation (s) present in the Spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2. Towards this, an in silico methodology was used, and the mutations on Spike glycoprotein were identified by comparing the Spike glycoprotein of first reported sequence from Wuhan wet seafood market virus with the available sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Indian isolates. Our analysis revealed the presence of twenty-five mutations in Spike glycoprotein among Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates. These mutations spread all over the protein and can be clustered at least into four distinct positions. Further, mutations at eleven positions exhibited alterations in the secondary structure of the polypeptide chain. We also investigated the influence of these mutations on overall protein dynamics and have shown that they affect the dynamic stability of the Spike glycoprotein.","Chand, Gyanendra Bahadur; Banerjee, Atanu; Azad, Gajendra Kumar",Gene Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33015411/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452014420303058; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genrep.2020.100891; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452014420303058?v=s5,73
597555,Lack of Complications in Patients with Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Diseases During SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak,2020-06-29,"The worldwide epidemic of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to a strong demand for highly efficient immunobinding to achieve rapid and accurate on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, hour-scale time-consumption is usually required to ensure the adequacy of immunobinding on expensive large instruments in hospitals, and the common false negative or positive results often occur in rapid on-site immunoassay (e.g. immunochromatography). We solved this dilemma by presenting a reciprocating-flowing immunobinding (RF-immunobinding) strategy. RF-immunobinding enabled the antibodies in fluid contacting with the corresponding immobilized antigens on substrate repeatedly during continuous reciprocating-flowing, to achieve adequate immunobinding within 60 s. This strategy was further developed into an immunoassay method for the serological detection of 13 suspected COVID-19 patients. We obtained a 100% true negative and true positive rate and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 4.14 pg/mL. Our strategy also can be a potential support for other areas related to immunorecognition, such as proteomics, immunopharmacology and immunohistochemistry.","Liu, Yiren; Tan, Yayin; Fu, Quanying; Lin, Maoren; He, Jinxu; He, Suhua; Yang, Mei; Chen, Shoudeng; Zhou, Jianhua",Biosens Bioelectron,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.112920; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566320309052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33418184/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566320309052,73

Based on the panel pollution-related data of 2013–2017, this research adopted a Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) equation to fit the relationship between pollution emission level and its related socio-economic indicators. The pollution emission level of the BTH region was fitted and projected by using the entropy evaluation method to measure the emission levels, the partial least squares algorithm to estimate the STIRPAT equation parameters, and the hybrid trend extrapolation model to forecast the future development of the above socioeconomic indicators. Empirical analysis showed that the fitting curve to air pollution emission level reached the peak in 2015 and then decreased with a fluctuating and slow process. The air pollution emissions in 2025 will decrease to the level of 2007. With regard to the impacts on the change of the air emission pollution level, industrial waste gas emissions play a decisive role. The influence of soot (dust) emissions is considerably smaller but still larger than that of SO(2) emissions. Besides, the slowing down of the economic development in the future will contribute to air quality improvement.

A non-experimental online research project was designed to determine the predictors of the severity of psychopathological symptoms, such as depression and PTSD symptoms, and the nature of the feedback mechanism between them in groups of men, remaining in hospital isolation due to infection and at-home isolation during the COVID-19 epidemic. The presence of symptoms of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a sense of threat due to the pandemic were assessed using the following screening tests: IES-R by Weiss and Marmar, PHQ-9 by Spitzer et al., and a self-constructed sliding scale for assessing COVID-19 anxiety. The study was carried out on a group of 57 firefighting cadets, hospitalized in a COVID-19 isolation room (M(age) = 23.01), staying in isolation due to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and a control group of 57 healthy men (M(age) = 41.38) staying at home during quarantine and national lockdown. COVID-19 pandemic causes many psychopathological reactions. The predictive models revealed that the predictors of symptoms of PTSD in isolated patients included depression and the experienced sense of COVID-19 threat resulting from the disease, while in the control group the symptoms of depression were the only predictor of PTSD. PTSD experiences are usually associated with depression. It may also be a form of the re-experiencing process or the effect of high affectivity, indirectly confirmed by the participation of hyperarousal in the feedback loop. Our findings highlight the importance of mental health aspects in patients treated during the COVID-19 pandemic.

600028,Predicting asymptomatic severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection rates of inpatients: A time-series analysis,2021-06-24,"BACKGROUND: Recurrent respiratory infections are one of the most important causes of morbidity in childhood. When immune functions are still largely immature, the airway epithelium plays a primary defensive role since, besides providing a physical barrier, it is also involved in the innate and the adaptive immune responses. A study was therefore designed to evaluate in vitro whether pidotimod, a synthetic dipeptide able to stimulate the inflammatory and immune effector cells, could activate bronchial epithelial cell functions involved in response to infections. METHODS: BEAS-2B cell line (human bronchial epithelial cells infected with a replication-defective Adenovirus 12-SV40 virus hybrid) were cultured in the presence of pidotimod, with or without tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α or zymosan to assess: a) intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression, by flow cytometry; b) toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 expression and production, by immunofluorescence flow cytometry and western blotting; d) interleukin (IL)-8 release, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); e) activated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) phosphorylation and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) activation, by western blotting. RESULTS: The constitutive expression of ICAM-1 and IL-8 release were significant up-regulated by TNF-α (ICAM-1) and by TNF-α and zymosan (IL-8), but not by pidotimod. In contrast, an increased TLR-2 expression was found after exposure to pidotimod 10 and 100 μg/ml (p < 0.05) and to the association pidotimod 100 μg/ml + TNF-α (p < 0.05). Western blot analysis substantiated that the constitutive TLR-2 expression was significantly increased after exposure to all the stimuli. Finally, while a remarkable inhibition of TNF-α -induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed in the presence of pidotimod, both TNF-α and pidotimod were effective in inducing NF-kB protein expression in the cytoplasm and its nuclear translocation. CONCLUSION: Through different effects on ERK1/2 and NF-kB, pidotimod was able to increase the expression of TLR-2 proteins, surface molecules involved in the initiation of the innate response to infectious stimuli. The lack of effect on ICAM-1 expression, the receptor for rhinovirus, and on IL-8 release, the potent chemotactic factor for neutrophils (that are already present in sites of infection), may represent protective functions. If confirmed in vivo, these activities may, at least in part, clarify the mechanism of action of this molecule at airway level.","Carta, Sonia; Silvestri, Michela; Rossi, Giovanni A",Ital J Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.1186/1824-7288-39-29; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23663325/,73

This study examines the behavior of biomarkers in patients with mild to severe COVID-19. Methods: The disease severity of 152 COVID-19 patients was classified into mild, moderate I, moderate II, and severe, and the behavior of laboratory biomarkers was examined across these four disease stages. Results: The median age and male/female ratio increased with severity. The mortality rate was 12.5% in both moderate II and severe stages. Underlying diseases, which were not observed in 45% of mild stage patients, increased with severity. An ROC analysis showed that C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, procalcitonin (PCT), hemoglobin (Hb) A1c, albumin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were significantly useful for the differential diagnosis of mild/moderate I stage and moderate II/severe stage. In the severe stage, Hb levels, coagulation time, total protein, and albumin were significantly different on the day of worsening from those observed on the day of admission. The frequency of hemostatic biomarker abnormalities was high in the severe disease stage. Conclusion: The evaluation of severity is valuable, as the mortality rate was high in the moderate II and severe stages. The levels of CRP, ferritin, PCT, albumin, and LDH were useful markers of severity, and hemostatic abnormalities were frequently observed in patients in the severe disease stage.","Yamamoto, Akitaka; Wada, Hideo; Ichikawa, Yuhuko; Mizuno, Hikaru; Tomida, Masaki; Masuda, Jun; Makino, Katsutoshi; Kodama, Shuji; Yoshida, Masamichi; Fukui, Shunsuke; Moritani, Isao; Inoue, Hidekazu; Shiraki, Katsuya; Shimpo, Hideto",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501223/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10173775,73

SARS-CoV-2 Preparedness among Community Hospitals in Southeastern United States,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Human Rhinoviruses (HRV) are major causative agents of acute respiratory tract infections in all age group and important contributing factors of childhood morbidity and mortality. Clinical presentation is poorly specific and the great antigenic and genetic variability of HRVs renders the biological diagnosis complex. Here, we have evaluated several molecular diagnostic protocols, including Taqman probe-based and intercalating agent-based RT-PCR assays. METHODS: 5,627 respiratory samples sent to the laboratory of Virology of the University Hospitals of Marseille, France, from March 2011 to February 2012, were tested using a real-time RT-PCR assay in the 5’NCR of the rhinoviral genome that associated a Taqman probe and the detection of DNA-BOXTO-dye complexes. A sample of 500 BOXTO-positive samples were further tested using the same probe assay (without BOXTO), and a SYBR Green assay (using the same amplification primers). The specific amplification of HRV sequences was assessed by NGS amplicon sequencing. RESULTS: The Taqman probe RT-PCR assay identified 696/5,627 samples (12,4%) as HRV-positive. BOXTO-positive samples included all probe-positive samples and 1,913 additional samples, of which only 24.3% were confirmed by sequencing. The SYBR Green assay was more specific (16/550 samples were probe-negative/SYBR Green-positive, all confirmed by 5′NCR sequencing), but 3/500 samples were probe-positive/SYBR Green-negative. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the difficulty in detecting HRVs in clinical samples using a single molecular detection system. Amongst the 3 systems tested, the best compromise was obtained with the SYBR Green assay, which, by comparison with our probe-based assay provided an improved sensitivity without altering the detection specificity. Interestingly, a majority of probe-negative/BOXTO- or SYBR Green-positive samples were not associated with mutations in the sequence targeted by the probe. Sequence-based modifications of the secondary structure of the HRV 5′NCR may be associated with a limited access to the probe hybridisation region. Further investigations may identify a test combining a probe based- and an intercalating agent-based detection, which will significantly improve the diagnosis of HRV infections.","Dupouey, Julien; Ninove, Laetitia; Ferrier, Vanessa; Py, Odile; Gazin, Céline; Thirion-Perrier, Laurence; de Lamballerie, Xavier",Virol J,https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-11-31; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548758/,73

However, nonspecific symptoms and biological characteristics similar to those of other common pathogenic fungi complicate the rapid and accurate diagnosis of T. marneffei infection. Sphingolipids (SPLs) are bioactive lipids involved in the regulation of various physiological and pathological processes and have been identified as serum biomarkers for several diseases. This study employed a sphingolipidomic approach established in our previous work to explore the use of serum SPLs in the diagnosis of HIV-negative patients with T. marneffei infection. Additional clinical cohorts of patients infected with other microorganisms were also recruited. We found that sphinganine (Sa) (d16:0) exhibited obvious depletion after infection; moreover, its level in patients with T. marneffei infection was significantly lower than that in patients infected with other microorganisms. Therefore, Sa (d16:0) was considered a specific diagnostic biomarker for T. marneffei infection, and 302.71 nM was selected as the optimal cutoff value with a diagnostic sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 100%. These results suggested that determination of serum Sa (d16:0) levels can be used as a new alternative tool for the rapid diagnosis of T. marneffei infection in HIV-negative patients.","Li, Zheng-Tu; Yau, Lee-Fong; Qiu, Ye; Li, Shao-Qiang; Zhan, Yang-Qing; Chan, Wai-Him; Chen, Zhao-Ming; Li, Zhun; Li, Yongming; Lin, Ye; Cheng, Jing; Zhang, Jian-Quan; Jiang, Zhi-Hong; Wang, Jing-Rong; Ye, Feng",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34262882/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.701913,73

In this study, we present an accurate method for temporal and geographical comparison of mutational events based on GISAID database genome sequencing. Among 42523 SARS-CoV-2 genomes analyzed, we found 23202 variants compared to the reference genome. The Ti/Tv (transition/transversion) ratio was used to filter out possible false-positive errors. Transition mutations generally occurred more frequently than transversions. Our clustering analysis revealed remarkable hotspot mutation patterns for SARS-CoV-2. Mutations were clustered based on how their frequencies changed over time according to each geographical location. We observed some clusters showing a clear variation in mutation frequency and continuously evolving in the world. However, many mutations appeared in specific periods without a clear pattern over time. Various important nonsynonymous mutations were observed, mainly in Oceania and Asia. More than half of these mutations were observed only once. Four hotspot mutations were found in all geographical locations at least once: T265I (NSP2), P314L (NSP12), D614G (S), and Q57H (ORF3a).

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study conducted at Yokohama Municipal Citizen’s Hospital and National Institute of Infectious Diseases. We recruited adult patients with COVID-19 admitted between March 2020 and January 2021. We compared RNAemia with clinical status on admission including scoring systems such as the 4C Mortality, CURB-65, and A-DROP, as well as the C(t) value of the nasopharyngeal PCR, in predicting COVID-19 mortality and critical condition development. RESULTS: Of the 92 recruited patients (median age, 58; interquartile range, 45–71 years), 14 (14.9%) had RNAemia. These patients had an older age (median, 68 years vs. 55.5 years; p = 0.011), higher values of lactated dehydrogenase (median, 381 U/L vs. 256.5 U/L, p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (median, 10.9 mg/dL vs. 3.8 mg/dL; p < 0.001), D-dimer (median, 2.07 μg/mL vs. 1.28 μg/mL; p = 0.015), lower values of lymphocyte (median, 802/μL vs. 1007/μL, p = 0.025) and C(t) of the nasopharyngeal PCR assay (median, 20.59 vs. 25.54; p = 0.021) than those without RNAemia.

We have investigated the relationship of apo D with 4-HNE, a major propagation product of lipid peroxidation, in stressed tissues. We included 20 pregnant women with GDM and 30 women with normal ongoing pregnancies as the control group. Placentas were collected and frozen for Western blot or included in paraffin for immunohistochemistry. The intensity of immunostaining was higher for apo D and 4-HNE in GDM samples; however, the differences in expression between the groups was more intense for apo D. Positive signals for both antibodies was detected in the villous trophoblast and adventitia tunica around the large blood vessels for all groups. Specific immunostaining for apo D was noted in some mesenchymal and macrophagic-like cells and this signal increased in diabetic placentas. Densitometry analysis of Western blots showed no significant difference for 4-HNE, but was significantly more intense for apo D in diabetic women. The contradictory results for 4-HNE could be due to changes which are too small and are masked in tissue homogenates. The results for apo D showed a strong relationship with GDM in the placenta that may reflect its suggested function in defense mechanisms against oxidative stress.","Navarro, A.; Alonso, A.; Garrido, P.; González, C.; González del Rey, C.; Ordoñez, C.; Tolivia, J.",Placenta,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.placenta.2009.11.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143400409003464; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0143400409003464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19944460/,73

610163,Serologic Status and SARS-CoV-2 Infection over 6 Months of Follow Up in Healthcare Workers in Chicago: A Cohort Study,2021-08-09,"INTRODUCTION: Heated high-flow nasal cannula (HHFNC) therapy for bronchiolitis has become increasingly prevalent without evidence that this therapy impacts patient outcomes. Lack of criteria for appropriate use may lead to overutilization, resulting in increased costs without patient benefit. Our primary aim was to decrease use of HHFNC in patients with bronchiolitis over one season. METHODS: Patients with Bronchiolitis younger than 2 years of age admitted to the Hospital Medicine Service were included in this study. Using the model for improvement framework, we identified key drivers for HHFNC overuse and revised our bronchiolitis protocol to include low-flow nasal cannula trials before HHFNC initiation. We compared preintervention HHFNC utilization (December 2018–April 2019) with postintervention HFNC utilization (December 2019–March 2020). RESULTS: One hundred ninety patients met inclusion criteria, 98 of them in the preintervention cohort and 92 in the postintervention cohort. Overall, the median age was 9 months and 65% of patients were male. Our HHFNC utilization rate decreased from 62% (61/98) to 43% (40/92) in the postintervention period. Our SPC analysis suggested special cause variation based on 7 points below the preintervention mean. CONCLUSIONS: This QI intervention implementing a specified low-flow nasal cannula trial before the initiation of HHFNC shows promise in reducing overall HHFNC use.

Those diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) may be negatively impacted by the global pandemic due to social isolation, feelings of loneliness or lack of access to care. This study seeks to assess the impact of the 1st lockdown – pre-, during and post – in adults with a recent history of MDD across multiple centres. METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of an on-going cohort study, RADAR-MDD project, a multi-centre study examining the use of remote measurement technology (RMT) in monitoring MDD. Self-reported questionnaire and passive data streams were analysed from participants who had joined the project prior to 1st December 2019 and had completed Patient Health and Self-esteem Questionnaires during the pandemic (n = 252). We used mixed models for repeated measures to estimate trajectories of depressive symptoms, self-esteem, and sleep duration. RESULTS: In our sample of 252 participants, 48% (n = 121) had clinically relevant depressive symptoms shortly before the pandemic. For the sample as a whole, we found no evidence that depressive symptoms or self-esteem changed between pre-, during- and post-lockdown. However, we found evidence that mean sleep duration (in minutes) decreased significantly between during- and post- lockdown (− 12.16; 95% CI − 18.39 to − 5.92; p < 0.001). We also found that those experiencing clinically relevant depressive symptoms shortly before the pandemic showed a decrease in depressive symptoms, self-esteem and sleep duration between pre- and during- lockdown (interaction p = 0.047, p = 0.045 and p < 0.001, respectively) as compared to those who were not. CONCLUSIONS: We identified changes in depressive symptoms and sleep duration over the course of lockdown, some of which varied according to whether participants were experiencing clinically relevant depressive symptoms shortly prior to the pandemic. However, the results of this study suggest that those with MDD do not experience a significant worsening in symptoms during the first months of the Covid − 19 pandemic.

However, this procedure currently has longest delay on surgical waiting lists (SWL). We have developed a special surgical program that aims to reduce this waiting list and to assess the economic and clinical repercussions in a high-volume bariatric surgery unit. METHODS: A three-month prospective study was carried out comparing outcomes, results and perioperative resources consumed for 45 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. The patients were divided into 2 groups: patients who underwent the standard procedure in the operating room, and patients treated in the special program. Epidemiological, healthcare and economic factors were taken into account. RESULTS: Two homogeneous groups of patients were operated on, successfully reducing the SWL. Morbidity was similar in both groups and the average cost of the surgeries performed was €5,331.40; in the standard group, the cost was €5,372.50 ± €798.10, and the cost of the special program group was €5,290.30 ± €685.10, with no significant differences.

This pandemic has spread over the world in more than 200 countries. India is also adversely affected by this pandemic, and there are no signs of slowing down of the virus in coming time. The absence of a vaccine for COVID-19 is making the situation worse for the already overstretched Indian public health care system. As economic burden makes it increasingly difficult for our country to continue imposing control measures, it is vital for states like West Bengal to make predictions using time series forecasting for the upcoming cases , test kits , health care and estimated the requirement of Quarantine centers, isolation beds, ICU beds and ventilators for COVID-19 patients . Objective: This study is forecasting the confirmed and active cases for COVID-19 until August, using time series ARIMA model & Public Health in West Bengal, India. Methods: We used ARIMA model, and Auto ARIMA model for forecasting confirmed and active cases till the end of August month using time series data of COVID-19 cases in West Bengal, India from March 1, 2020, to June 4, 2020. Discussion and Conclusion: This forecasts show a very crucial situation for West Bengal in coming days and, the actual numbers can go higher than our estimates of confirmed case as Lockdown 5.0 & Unlock 1.0 will be implemented from 1st June 2020 in India, West Bengal will be observing a partial lift of the lockdown and in that case, there will be a surge in the number of daily confirmed and active cases. The requirement of Health care sector needs to be further improved isolation beds, ICUs and ventilators will also be needed to increase in that scenario. Inter State & Intra State Movement restrictions are lifted. Hence, Migrants returning to their homes due to loss of livelihood and income in the lockdown period may lead to a rise in the number of cases, which could not be accounted for in our projections. We suggest more of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model in the health sector to accommodate COVID-19 patients adequately and reduce the burden of the already overstretched Indian public health care system, which will directly or indirectly affect the States in the time of crisis.

Medical decisions are processes that guide the production of a health diagnosis or treatment, using the available information, where the patients’ preferences are often incorporated. This article tackles the impact of the pandemic on chronically ill patients’ medical decisions when the care system has been significantly altered by it. Considering that health decisions are importantly embedded in social and economic conditions, the pandemic affects a precarious care system and constrains individual possibilities. Chile has a weak support infrastructure for caregivers and a health care system that promotes private health and a low-quality public health system. Hence, the pandemic is an adverse context for chronically ill patients and it alters the conditions in which medical decisions are taken. We performed 10 interviews with chronically ill patients who took responsibility for their own health decisions: five patients diagnosed with common chronic diseases and five patients diagnosed with rare chronic diseases. After Reflexive Thematic Analysis, the results show that the Chilean health system is extremely precarious and that not many alternatives are or have been offered to chronically ill patients in the COVID19 context.","Schöngut-Grollmus, Nicolás; Energici, María-Alejandra; Zuñiga, Natalia",Front Sociol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34447806/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.666758,73

We conducted a survey of 1,048 people in five major cities in China to track and quantify the behavior changes in different periods since the outbreak. It is found that there was nearly 80% reduction of out-of-home activities (working, eating, shopping, taking public transportation, and travelling) during the peak period. Such activities are gradually increasing after the easing of containment measures but still significantly below pre-outbreak level. The significant behavior changes have contributed to the rapid control of virus transmission in China. While countries are reopening the economies before the virus disappears, the system and capacity of testing and contact tracing should be carefully designed with the tracking of people behavior changes in the future.","Wu, Y.; Huang, M.; Xie, G.; Chen, X.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.15.20097667v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.15.20097667,73
624773,Virulent Epidemics and Scope of Healthcare Workers' Duty of Care,2006-08-11,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, which is responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), uses angiotensin (ANG)-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entrance receptor. Although most COVID-19 cases are mild, some are severe or critical, predominantly due to acute lung injury. It has been widely accepted that a counter regulatory renin-angiotensin system (RAS) axis including the ACE2/ANG [1-7]/Mas protects the lungs from acute lung injury. However, recent evidence suggests that the generation of protective ANG [1-7] in the lungs is predominantly mediated by proinflammatory prolyloligopeptidase (POP), which has been repeatedly demonstrated to be involved in lung pathology. This review contends that acute lung injury in severe COVID-19 is characterised by a) ACE2 downregulation and malfunction (inflammatory signalling) due to viral occupation, and b) dysregulation of the protective RAS axis, predominantly due to increased activity of proinflammatory POP. It follows that a reasonable treatment strategy in COVID-19-related acute lung injury would be delivering functional recombinant (r) ACE2 forms to trap the virus. Additionally, or alternatively to rACE2 delivery, the potential benefits resulting from lowering POP activity should also be explored. These treatment strategies deserve further investigation.","Triposkiadis, Filippos; Starling, Randall C.; Xanthopoulos, Andrew; Butler, Javed; Boudoulas, Harisios",Heart Lung Circ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1443950620315389; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1443950620315389; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2020.11.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33454213/,73

Identifying variations in SARS-CoV-2 strains from different regions is a key factor for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms, aid in diagnosis, prevention and therapy of this disease. The present study is an analytical descriptive study aimed to determine genetic variations among SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in China. Sixty six complete genome sequences of the virus were retrieved from NCBI, the sequence of original Wuhan strain accession number NC 045512 was used as the reference sequence. Each genome sequence was blasted against the original Wuhan strain; the analysis was done using NCBI Nucleo-blast. The collected sequences showed 10 different variants. One hundred and thirty four mutations were identified among the variants of SARS-CoV-2 in this study; most of them 52.2% (70/134) were missense point mutation, majority of the mutations 65.7% (88/134) occurred in the open reading frame a/b (ORFab), few mutations occurred in the structural viral genome, each of spike (S) gene and nucleocapsid (N) gene showed 4 mutations; 2 silent point mutations and 2 missense point mutations occurred in each gene whereas membrane (M) gene showed silent point mutation and no mutation observed in the envelope E gene. The remarkable observation in this study showed by Yunnan variant accession number MT226610 which exhibited high incidence of mutations, it displayed 28 different point mutations; only 3(10.7%) of them were silent mutations while the rest were missense mutations.

628446,Molecular Pathology in the Lungs of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Patients,2007-02-01,"The evolutionary history of avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (PMV1), which includes the agents of Newcastle disease (ND), is characterized by a series of strain emergence events since viruses in this family were first recognized in the 1920s. Despite the importance of ND to the poultry industry, little is known about PMV1 strain emergence events and the subsequent dispersal and evolution of new strains. The genotype VI-PMV1 was first identified in the 1980s and has been named pigeon paramyxovirus-1 (PPMV1) because of unusual host specificity with Columbiformes (Collins et al., 1996); it has been responsible for panzootics in both chickens and pigeons during that time. Here, we used evolutionary analyses to characterize the emergence of this contemporary PMV1 lineage. We demonstrate that GVI-PMV1 arose through cross-species transmission events from Galliformes (i.e. chicken) to Columbiformes, and quickly established in pigeon populations. Our studies revealed a close association between the time of viral emergence and panzootic events of this virus. The virus appeared first in Southeastern Europe and quickly spread across the European continent, which became the epicenter for global virus dissemination. With new viral gene sequences, we show that GVI-PMV1 viruses currently circulating in North America resulted from multiple invasion events from Europe, one associated with an exotic European Columbiformes species, and that extant lineages have diversified locally. This study extends our understanding of successful viral emergence subsequent to cross-species transmission and dispersal patterns of newly emerged avian viruses, which may improve surveillance awareness and disease control of this and other important avian pathogens.","Chong, Yee Ling; Lam, Tommy Tsan-Yuk; Kim, Oekyung; Lu, Huaguang; Dunn, Patty; Poss, Mary",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134813001743; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2013.04.025; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134813001743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23628639/,73

I show this in a simple economic model of an epidemic in which agents choose social activity under health state uncertainty. In the model, susceptible and asymptomatic agents are more socially active when they think they might be immune. And this increased activity escalates infections, deaths, and welfare losses. Antibody testing, however, prevents this escalation by revealing that those agents are not immune.

Design: Time series of cross-sectional online surveys. Setting: Data were collected between 2 March and 5 August 2020. Participants: 42,127 responses from 31,787 people living in the UK, aged 16 years or over, are presented (21 survey waves, n{approx}2,000 per wave). Main outcome measures: Identification of the key symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, high temperature / fever, and loss of sense of smell or taste), self-reported adherence to self-isolation if symptomatic, requesting an antigen test if symptomatic, intention to share details of close contacts, self-reported adherence to quarantine if alerted that you had been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. Results: Only 48.9% of participants (95% CI 48.2% to 49.7%) identified key symptoms of COVID-19. Self-reported adherence to test, trace and isolate behaviours was low (self-isolation 18.2%, 95% CI 16.4% to 19.9%; requesting an antigen test 11.9%, 95% CI 10.1% to 13.8%; intention to share details of close contacts 76.1%, 95% CI 75.4% to 76.8%; quarantining 10.9%, 95% CI 7.8% to 13.9%) and largely stable over time. By contrast, intention to adhere to protective measures was much higher. Non-adherence was associated with: men, younger age groups, having a dependent child in the household, lower socio-economic grade, greater hardship during the pandemic, and working in a key sector.

Capturing important lessons learnt, both positive and negative, is vital. We aimed to document the perceived positive changes (silver linings) in cancer care that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify challenges that may limit their long-term adoption. METHODS: This study employed a qualitative design. Semi-structured interviews (n = 20) were conducted with key opinion leaders from 14 countries. The participants were predominantly members of the International COVID-19 and Cancer Taskforce, who convened in March 2020 to address delivery of cancer care in the context of the pandemic. The Framework Method was employed to analyse the positive changes of the pandemic with corresponding challenges to their maintenance post-pandemic. RESULTS: Ten themes of positive changes were identified which included: value in cancer care, digital communication, convenience, inclusivity and cooperation, decentralisation of cancer care, acceleration of policy change, human interactions, hygiene practices, health awareness and promotion and systems improvement. Impediments to the scale-up of these positive changes included resource disparities and variation in legal frameworks across regions. Barriers were largely attributed to behaviours and attitudes of stakeholders. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to important value-based innovations and changes for better cancer care across different health systems. The challenges to maintaining/implementing these changes vary by setting.

We conducted a PubMed search, and 166 articles published between 2012 and 2018 on FDA-approved drug products were selected for further review. Qualifying publications were summarized according to therapeutic area, medication(s) studied, pharmacokinetic model type utilized, simulator program used, and the applications of that modeling. The results showed a 13-fold increase in the number of papers published from 2012 to 2018, with the largest proportion of articles dedicated to the areas of infectious diseases, oncology, and neurology, and application extensions including prediction of drug-drug interactions due to metabolism and/or transporter-mediated effects and understanding drug kinetics in special populations. In addition, we profiled several high-impact studies whose results were used to guide package insert information and formulate dose recommendations. These results show that while utilization of PBPK modeling has drastically increased over the past several years, regulatory support, lack of easy-to-use systems for clinicians, and challenges with model validation remain major challenges for the widespread adoption of this practice in institutional and ambulatory settings. However, PBPK modeling will continue to be a useful tool in the future to assess therapeutic drug monitoring and the growing field of personalized medicine.

METHODS: We conducted an online survey from May 25, 2020 until June 10, 2020 among Chinese university students who had been quarantined at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Social support was assessed using the Social Support Rating Scale. Self-perceived emotional competency was measured using a Chinese version of the self-report Wong Law Emotional Intelligence Scale. The 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale was used to assess nonspecific symptoms of psychological disorders. RESULTS: A total of 6,027 college students participated in the survey, of whom 2,732 (45.3%) reported mental health issues. Men and people in a relationship showed higher frequencies of psychological disorders. Social support and emotional intelligence were both negatively associated with psychological disorders. Stepwise linear regression revealed that the most important predictors of psychological disorders were self-emotion appraisal, family relationships, and showing panic about COVID-19 on the social media. Path analysis suggested that the association between pandemic exposure and psychological disorders was partially mediated by emotional intelligence, but not by social support.

Lymphadenopathy might be caused by proliferation of cells intrinsic to the node, such as lymphocytes, plasma cells, monocytes or histiocytes or by infiltration of cells extrinsic to the node, such as neutrophils and malignant cells. Lymphadenopathy is also a presenting sign of malignancies such as leukemia, lymphoma, or neuroblastoma and it is important to be able to differentiate benign from malignant lymphadenopathy. Splenomegaly can be caused by diseases that result in hyperplasia of the lymphoid and reticuloendothelial systems, infiltrative disorders, hematologic disorders and conditions that cause distention of the sinusoids whenever there is increased pressure in the portal or splenic veins. The significance of splenomegaly depends on the underlying disease. In children, a palpable spleen may occasionally be due to visceroptosis rather than true splenomegaly.

However, infrastructure is inadequate for the immediate vaccination of the whole population. Therefore, policies have adopted a strategy to vaccinate older adults and vulnerable populations while delaying vaccination for others. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand how age-specific vaccination strategies reduce daily cases, hospitalizations, and death rates using official statistics for Tennessee, United States. METHODS: This study used publicly available data on COVID-19, including vaccination rates, positive cases, hospitalizations, and deaths from the Tennessee Department of Health. Data from the first date of vaccination (December 17, 2020) to March 3, 2021, were retrieved. The rates were adjusted by 2019 data from the US Census Bureau, and age groups were stratified into 10-year intervals starting with 21 years of age. RESULTS: The findings showed that vaccination strategy can reduce the numbers of patients with COVID-19 in all age groups, with lower hospitalization and death rates in older populations. Older adults had a 95% lower death rate from December to March; no change in the death rate of other age groups was observed. The hospitalization rate was reduced by 80% for people aged ≥80 years, while people who were 50 to 70 years old had nearly the same hospitalization rate as prior to vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: This research indicates that targeting older age groups for vaccination is the optimal way to avoid higher transmissions and reduce hospitalization and death rates.","Roghani, Ali",JMIRx Med,https://doi.org/10.2196/29324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34424255/,73

Recognizing that the majority of COVID-19 cases are mild and do not require hospitalization, Partners HealthCare implemented an automated pre-hospital triage solution to direct patients to the appropriate care setting before they showed up at the emergency department, which would otherwise consume resources, expose other patients and staff to potential viral transmission, and further exacerbate supply-and demand mismatching.

639005,Severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG results among healthcare workers in a rural upstate New York hospital system,2020-10-26,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) infection, which has emerged as a global pandemic causing serious concerns. Lack of specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of COVID‐19 is a major concern and the development of vaccines is another important aspect in managing the infection effectively. The first step in the SARS‐CoV‐2 pathogenesis is the viral entry and it is mediated by its densely glycosylated spike protein (S‐protein). Similar to the SARS‐CoV, SARS‐CoV‐2 also engages angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the host cell entry receptor. In addition to ACE2, several recent studies have implicated the crucial role of cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) as a necessary assisting cofactor for ACE2‐mediated SARS‐CoV‐2 entry. Furthermore, SARS‐CoV‐2 was also identified to use both endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for the pivotal role of S‐protein priming mediating viral entry. As the entry of SARS‐CoV‐2 into host cells is mandatory for viral infection, it becomes an extremely attractive therapeutic intervention point. In this regard, this review will focus on the therapeutic targeting of the crucial steps of SARS‐CoV‐2 viral entry like S‐protein/ACE2 interaction and S‐protein priming by host cell proteases. In addition, this review will also give insights to the readers on several therapeutic opportunities, pharmacological targeting of the viral‐entry facilitators like S‐Protein, ACE2, cell surface HS, TMPRSS2, and CatB/L and evidence for those drugs currently ongoing clinical studies.","Muralidar, Shibi; Gopal, Gayathri; Visaga Ambi, Senthil",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33851732/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27019,73
641599,Clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with false-negative severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test results,2021-04-19,"OBJECTIVES: In late July, Cyprus experienced the second epidemic wave of COVID‐19. We present the steps taken by the government and evaluate their effect on epidemic trends. MATERIALS: Cyprus Press and Information Office data were analysed. Using an R‐based forecasting program, two models were created to predict cases up to 01/09/2020: Model 1, which utilised data up to 09/06/2020, when airports reopened to foreign travelers with COVID‐19 screening; and Model 2, which utilised data until 24/06/2020, when screening for passengers from low‐transmission countries was discontinued. RESULTS: PIO data revealed no significant policy changes between 24/06/2020 and 31/07/2020. Prediction models were robust and accurate (Model 1, R (2) = 0.999, P < .001; Model 2, R (2) = 0.998, P < .001). By August 30th, recorded cases exceeded those predicted by Model 1 by 24.47% and by Model 2 by 20.95%, with P values <.001 for both cases. CONCLUSIONS: The significant difference between recorded cases and those projected by Models 1 and 2 suggests that changes in epidemic trends may have been associated with policy changes after their respective dates. Discontinuation of major restrictions such as airport reopening, can destabilise the control of the epidemic, and may concomitantly necessitate a reevaluation of the current epidemic status. In the face of an evolving situation such as the COVID‐19 pandemic, states are forced to balance the imposing of restrictions against their impact on the economy.","Kakoullis, Loukas; Eliades, Elias; Papachristodoulou, Eleni; Parperis, Konstantinos; Chra, Paraskevi; Constantinidou, Anastasia; Chatzittofis, Andreas; Sampsonas, Fotios; Panos, George",Int J Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13944; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33338320/,73

The existing therapeutic options for COVID-19 beyond the intensive supportive care are limited, with an undefined or modest efficacy reported so far. Drug repurposing represents an enthusiastic mechanism to use approved drugs outside the scope of their original indication and accelerate the discovery of new therapeutic options. With the emergence of COVID-19, drug repurposing has been largely applied for early clinical testing. In this Review, we discuss some repurposed anticancer drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 and under investigation in clinical trials or proposed for the clinical testing. .","El Bairi, Khalid; Trapani, Dario; Petrillo, Angelica; Le Page, Cécile; Zbakh, Hanaa; Daniele, Bruno; Belbaraka, Rhizlane; Curigliano, Giuseppe; Afqir, Said",Eur J Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33125946/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804920305207?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.09.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959804920305207,73

METHODS: Wistar male rats were equally divided into sham (i.e., non-operated), saline (both treated with 0.1 ml/kg saline), and six TCZ groups treated with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 mg/kg TCZ (TCZ1 to TCZ32, respectively). Twenty-four hours after administration of vehicle or TCZ, exodontia of the first lower left molar was performed, and the animals were euthanized three days later for hematological analysis and organ (liver, spleen, and kidney mass indexes, and histological evaluation), gingiva (myeloperoxidase [MPO] assay), and mandible (radiographic, histomorphometric analysis, and IL-6 immunostaining) evaluation. Analysis of variance/Bonferroni test (statistical significance, p<0.05) was performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). RESULTS: There was no difference in radiographic results; however, leukopenia (p=0.039) and neutropenia (p<0.001) were statistically significant in the TCZ16 and TCZ32 groups. Weight loss (p<0.001) and reduced liver index (p=0.001) were significantly dose dependent; however, no histological alterations were observed in the other organs. Osteoclast counts were reduced in groups TCZ4 to TCZ32 (p<0.001), and IL-6 immunostaining increased in the TCZ8 to TCZ32 groups (p<0.001). Alveolar infection rates increased in groups TCZ4 to TCZ32 (p<0.001), and MPO had biphasic response, exhibiting a reduction in groups TCZ2 and TCZ4, and an increase in group TCZ32 (p=0.004). CONCLUSION: TCZ-induced immunosuppression led to a reduction in osteoclast function, an increase in alveolar infection, and compensatory neutrophil infiltration.","de Queiroz Rodrigues, Maria Imaculada; de Lima Martins, Joyce Ohana; de Barros Silva, Paulo Goberlânio; Ferreira Júnior, Antônio Ernando Carlos; Lima Verde, Maria Elisa Quezado; Sousa, Fabrício Bitú; Mota, Mário Rogério Lima; Negreiros Nunes Alves, Ana Paula",J Oral Maxillofac Surg,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2020.08.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278239120310570?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278239120310570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32919953/,73

Therefore, we investigated the relationship between intrinsic motivation for training, self-efficacy for CPR, and CPR skill acquisition through training. Twenty health sciences undergraduate students participated in a 3-hour basic life support course. Their chest compression skills were assessed before and after the course. The main outcome of this study was the chest compression score, with changes in the score from pretest to posttest regarded as the short-term learning effects from training. The chest compression score was significantly higher after the course (median 53.5%, interquartile range [IQR] 39.8–83.0) than before the course (median 14.0%, IQR 0–43.3, p < 0.001). Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between perceived competence after the training and changes in the chest compression score from pretest to posttest (r = 0.483, p = 0.031), but other psychological indices did not correlate with changes in the chest compression score. A significant correlation was noted between trainees’ perceived competency and the short-term learning effects of CPR training.

Although most patients with COVID-19 have a mild or moderate course of disease, up to 5%-10% of patients may have a serious and potentially life-threatening condition, indicating an urgent need for effective therapeutic drugs. The therapeutic effect of thymosin on COVID-19 has not been previously studied. In this paper, for the first time we report a case of thymosin treatment of COVID-19. CASE SUMMARY: A 51-year-old man with imported COVID-19 was admitted with definite symptoms of chest tightness, chest pain, and fatigue. The polymerase chain reaction results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were negative. The antibody test was positive, confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19. As many orally administered drugs were not well tolerated due to gastrointestinal symptoms, an emergency use of thymosin, a polypeptide consisting of 28 amino acids, was administered by injection. Finally, after the implementation of the treatment program, symptoms and lung imaging improved significantly. CONCLUSION: In this case report, it is confirmed that thymosin may help alleviate the severity of COVID-19 symptoms.","Zheng, Qiong Na; Xu, Mei Yan; Gan, Fang Min; Ye, Sha Sha; Zhao, Hui",World J Clin Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34141770/; https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v9.i16.4090,73

This has not only changed the way we live and work but has also changed the pattern of hospital admissions and medical care. To see if there was significant change in the pattern and management of trauma in our region, we evaluated data from our centre for the lockdown period and compared it with data from the previous year, and also with some available international data. METHODS: We collated data from our Tertiary care hospital for two periods, i.e. from 25th March 2020 to 3rd May 2020 signifying strict lockdown and then from 4th May to 31st May during which some conditional relaxations were given. This was compared to data from similar periods in 2019. We looked at patient demographics, fracture types, injury mechanisms, and even changes in treatment protocols. RESULTS: Significant reductions in caseloads were noted; open injuries were less, road accidents were infrequent, but cases due to falls, especially children and the elderly were still seen, although slightly reduced. The plan to minimize operative interventions could not be fully implemented due to complex nature of trauma seen by us. Only one case of bilateral amputation turned out to be positive, with no infectious consequences to the treating staff. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic led to significant reductions in trauma caseload and change in injury patterns. Doctor responses and patient management needs significant alteration to prevent spread of disease.","Dhillon, M.

There is a well-recognized link between coagulation and inflammation, however, the extent of thrombotic events associated with COVID-19 warrants further investigation. Poly(A) Binding Protein Cytoplasmic 4 (PABPC4), Serine/Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitor Clade G Member 1 (SERPING1) and Vitamin K epOxide Reductase Complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), which are all proteins linked to coagulation, have been shown to interact with SARS proteins. We computationally examined the interaction of these with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and, in the case of VKORC1, we describe its binding to ORF7a in detail. We examined the occurrence of variants of each of these proteins across populations and interrogated their potential contribution to COVID-19 severity. Potential mechanisms by which some of these variants may contribute to disease are proposed. Some of these variants are prevalent in minority groups that are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19. Therefore, we are proposing that further investigation around these variants may lead to better understanding of disease pathogenesis in minority groups and more informed therapeutic approaches. Author summary Increased blood clotting, especially in the lungs, is a common complication of COVID-19. Infectious diseases cause inflammation which in turn can contribute to increased blood clotting. However, the extent of clot formation that is seen in the lungs of COVID-19 patients suggests that there may be a more direct link. We identified three human proteins that are involved indirectly in the blood clotting cascade and have been shown to interact with proteins of SARS virus, which is closely related to the novel coronavirus. We examined computationally the interaction of these human proteins with the viral proteins. We looked for genetic variants of these proteins and examined how these variants are distributed across populations. We investigated whether variants of these genes could impact severity of COVID-19. Further investigation around these variants may provide clues for the pathogenesis of COVID-19 particularly in minority groups.","Holcomb, David; Alexaki, Aikaterini; Hernandez, Nancy; Laurie, Kyle; Kames, Jacob; Hamasaki-Katagiri, Nobuko; Komar, Anton A.; DiCuccio, Michael; Kimchi-Sarfaty, Chava",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.08.272328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32935103/,73

We compared clinical characteristics and sought differences between infants with single Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) infection and those with RSV coinfection. METHODS: We enrolled 80 patients with pertussis who were hospitalized in Shenzhen Children’s Hospital from January 2017 to December 2019. Respiratory tract samples were tested for B. pertussis with real-time polymerase chain reaction and respiratory viruses with immunofluorescence assay. Clinical data were obtained from hospital records and collected using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: Thirty-seven of 80 patients had B. pertussis infection alone (pertussis group) and 43 had RSV-pertussis coinfection (coinfection group). No significant differences were found with regard to sex, body weight, preterm birth history, pertussis vaccination, symptoms, presence of pneumonia, or lymphocyte count between the 2 groups. Univariate analysis showed patients with RSV coinfection were older (median, 4.57 months vs 4.03 months, p = 0.048); more commonly treated with β-lactam antibiotics (21% vs 5%, p = 0.044); had higher rates of wheezes (40% vs 14%, p = 0.009) and rales (35% vs 14%, p = 0.028) on chest auscultation, a higher rate of readmission (40% vs 11%, p = 0.004), and a longer hospital stay (median, 10 days vs 7 days, p = 0.002). In the further binary logistic regression analysis, patients with RSV coinfection had higher rates of wheezes (OR = 3.802; 95% CI: 1.106 to 13.072; p = 0.034) and readmission (OR = 5.835; 95% CI: 1.280 to 26.610; p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: RSV coinfection increases readmission rate in children hospitalized for pertussis.

Here, we analyzed the distribution and character of emerging mutations in a data set comprising more than 95,000 virus genomes covering eight major SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the GISAID database, including genotypes arising during COVID-19 therapy. Globally, the C>U transitions and G>U transversions were the most represented mutations, accounting for the majority of single-nucleotide variations. Mutational spectra were not influenced by the time the virus had been circulating in its host or medical treatment. At the amino acid level, we observed about a 2-fold excess of substitutions in favor of hydrophobic amino acids over the reverse. However, most mutations constituting variants of interests of the S-protein (spike) lead to hydrophilic amino acids, counteracting the global trend. The C>U and G>U substitutions altered codons towards increased amino acid hydrophobicity values in more than 80% of cases. The bias is explained by the existing differences in the codon composition for amino acids bearing contrasting biochemical properties. Mutation asymmetries apparently influence the biochemical features of SARS CoV-2 proteins, which may impact protein–protein interactions, fusion of viral and cellular membranes, and virion assembly.","Matyášek, Roman; Řehůřková, Kateřina; Berta Marošiová, Kristýna; Kovařík, Aleš",Genes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34072181/; https://doi.org/10.3390/genes12060826,73

Disruptions have been seen across all facets of care. While the long-term impact of COVID-19 remains unclear, the immediate impacts on patients, their carers and the healthcare workforce are increasingly evident. This study describes disruptions and reorganisation of cancer services in Australia since the onset of COVID-19, from the perspectives of people affected by cancer and healthcare workers. Two separate online cross-sectional surveys were completed by: a) cancer patients, survivors, carers, family members or friends (n = 852) and b) healthcare workers (n = 150). Descriptive analyses of quantitative survey data were conducted, followed by inductive thematic content analyses of qualitative survey responses relating to cancer care disruption and perceptions of telehealth. Overall, 42% of cancer patients and survivors reported experiencing some level of care disruption. A further 43% of healthcare workers reported atypical delays in delivering cancer care, and 50% agreed that patient access to research and clinical trials had been reduced. Almost three quarters (73%) of patients and carers reported using telehealth following the onset of COVID-19, with high overall satisfaction. However, gaps were identified in provision of psychological support and 20% of participants reported that they were unlikely to use telehealth again. The reorganisation of cancer care increased the psychological and practical burden on carers, with hospital visitation restrictions and appointment changes reducing their ability to provide essential support. COVID-19 has exacerbated a stressful and uncertain time for people affected by cancer and healthcare workers. Service reconfiguration and the adoption of telehealth have been essential adaptations for the pandemic response, offering long-term value. However, our findings highlight the need to better integrate psychosocial support and the important role of carers into evolving pandemic response measures. Learnings from this study could inform service improvements that would benefit patients and carers longer-term.","Edge, Rhiannon; Meyers, Josh; Tiernan, Gabriella; Li, Zhicheng; Schiavuzzi, Alexandra; Chan, Priscilla; Vassallo, Amy; Morrow, April; Mazariego, Carolyn; Wakefield, Claire E.; Canfell, Karen; Taylor, Natalie",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34534231/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257420,73

METHODS: By the convenient sampling, 1422 urban residents from Jiangxi province were assessed with Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Short Scale (EPQ-RSC), Psychological Questionnaires for Emergent Events of Public Health (PQEEPH), Family APGAR Scale (APGAR) and Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). The relation among personality traits, psychological stress, family function and life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic was analyzed by using the canonical correlation analysis and the serial mediation model. RESULTS: (1) Among the estimated correlation coefficients, the first two pairs were significant (P < 0.001 in each). (2) In the first pair of canonical variables, the loadings of neuroticism and neurasthenia were the higher (0.94, 0.70). (3) Neuroticism and life satisfaction mediated the relationship between family function and neurasthenia (β(neuroticism) = -0.174; 95%CI:-0.224, -0.134; β(life satisfaction) = -0.034, 95%CI:-0.012, -0.062), respectively. In addition, serial mediation analyses indicated that the association of family function and neurasthenia is mediated by neuroticism and life satisfaction in a sequential manner (β = -0.010; 95%CI:-0.020, -0.004). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, neuroticism was closely related to psychological stress of urban residents, especially neurasthenia. In addition, the serial mediating effect of neuroticism and life satisfaction played an important role in the process of family function influencing neurasthenia.

663098,Mathematical Model of the Role of Asymptomatic Infection in Outbreaks of Some Emerging Pathogens,2020-12-09,"Background: Following stringent social distancing measures, some European countries are beginning to report a slowed or negative rate of growth of daily case numbers testing positive for the novel coronavirus. The notion that the first wave of infection is close to its peak begs the question of whether future peaks or second waves are likely. We sought to determine the current size of the effective (i.e. susceptible) population for seven European countries - to estimate immunity levels following this first wave. We compare these numbers to the total population sizes of these countries, in order to investigate the potential for future peaks. Methods: We used Bayesian model inversion to estimate epidemic parameters from the reported case and death rates from seven countries using data from late January 2020 to April 5th 2020. Two distinct generative model types were employed: first a continuous time dynamical-systems implementation of a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model and second: a partially observable Markov Decision Process (MDP) or hidden Markov model (HMM) implementation of an SEIR model. Both models parameterise the size of the initial susceptible population (S0), as well as epidemic parameters. Parameter estimation (data fitting) was performed using a standard Bayesian scheme (variational Laplace) designed to allow for latent unobservable states and uncertainty in model parameters. Results: Both models recapitulated the dynamics of transmissions and disease as given by case and death rates. The peaks of the current waves were predicted to be in the past for four countries (Italy, Spain, Germany and Switzerland) and to emerge in 0.5-2 weeks in Ireland and 1-3 weeks in the UK. For France one model estimated the peak within the past week and the other in the future in two weeks. Crucially, Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of S0 for each country indicated effective population sizes of below 20% (of total population size), under both the continuous time and HMM models. Using for all countries, with a Bayesian weighted average across all seven countries and both models, we estimated that 6.4% of the total population would be immune. From the two models the maximum percentage of the effective population was estimated at 19.6% of the total population for the UK, 16.7% for Ireland, 11.4% for Italy, 12.8% for Spain, 18.8% for France, 4.7% for Germany and 12.9% for Switzerland. Conclusion: Our results indicate that after the current wave, a large proportion of the total population will remain without immunity. This suggests that in the absence of strong seasonal effects, new medications or more comprehensive contact tracing, a further set of epidemic waves in different geographic centres are likely. These findings may have implications for exit strategies from any lockdown stage.","Moran, Rosalyn J; Fagerholm, Erik D; Daunizeau, Jean; Cullen, Maell; Richardson, Mark P; Williams, Steven; Turkheimer, Federico; Leech, Rob; Friston, Karl",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060426,73

This paper provides a perspective of the ongoing or completed RCTs related to antithrombotic strategies used in COVID-19, the opportunities and challenges for the clinical trial enterprise, and areas of existing knowledge, as well as data gaps that may motivate the design of future RCTs.","Talasaz, Azita H.; Sadeghipour, Parham; Kakavand, Hessam; Aghakouchakzadeh, Maryam; Kordzadeh-Kermani, Elaheh; Van Tassell, Benjamin W.; Gheymati, Azin; Ariannejad, Hamid; Hosseini, Seyed Hossein; Jamalkhani, Sepehr; Sholzberg, Michelle; Monreal, Manuel; Jimenez, David; Piazza, Gregory; Parikh, Sahil A.; Kirtane, Ajay J.; Eikelboom, John W.; Connors, Jean M.; Hunt, Beverley J.; Konstantinides, Stavros V.; Cushman, Mary; Weitz, Jeffrey I.; Stone, Gregg W.; Krumholz, Harlan M.; Lip, Gregory Y.H.; Goldhaber, Samuel Z.; Bikdeli, Behnood",J Am Coll Cardiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109721004587; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33741176/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2021.02.035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735109721004587,73

Clinicians, restaurant cooks, cashiers, transit operators, and other essential workers (EWs), however, continued to work outside the home during this time in order to keep others alive and maintain a functioning society. In the United States, EWs are often low-income persons of color who are more likely to face socioeconomic vulnerabilities, systemic racism, and health inequities. To assess the various impacts of COVID-19 on EWs, an online survey was distributed to a representative sample of individuals residing in six states during May/June 2020. The sample included 990 individuals who identified as EWs and 736 nonessential workers (NWs). We assessed differences between EW and NW respondents according to three categories related to health equity and social determinants of health: (1) demographics (e.g. race/ethnicity); (2) COVID-19 exposure risk pathways (e.g. ability to social distance); and (3) COVID-19 risk perceptions (e.g. perceived risk of contracting COVID-19). EWs were more likely to be Black or Hispanic than NWs and also had lower incomes and education levels on average. Unsurprisingly, EWs were substantially more likely to report working outside the home and less likely to report social distancing and wearing masks indoors as compared to NWs. EWs also perceived a slightly greater risk of contracting COVID-19. These findings, which we discuss in the context of persistent structural inequalities, systemic racism, and health inequities within the United States, highlight ways in which COVID-19 exacerbates existing socioeconomic vulnerabilities faced by EWs.","Roberts, Jennifer D; Dickinson, Katherine L; Koebele, Elizabeth; Neuberger, Lindsay; Banacos, Natalie; Blanch-Hartigan, Danielle; Welton-Mitchell, Courtney; Birkland, Thomas A",Toxicol Ind Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33241763/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0748233720970439,73

The European Myeloma Network has provided an expert consensus statement in order to guide therapeutic decisions in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient education for personal hygiene and social distancing measures, along with treatment individualization, telemedicine and continuous surveillance for early diagnosis of COVID-19 are essential. In countries or local communities where COVID-19 infection is widely spread, MM patients should have a PCR test of nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 before hospital admission, starting a new treatment line, cell apheresis or ASCT in order to avoid ward or community spread and infections. Oral agent-based regimens should be considered, especially for the elderly and frail patients with standard risk disease, whereas de-intensified regimens for dexamethasone, bortezomib, carfilzomib and daratumumab should be used based on patient risk and response. Treatment initiation should not be postponed for patients with end organ damage, myeloma emergencies and aggressive relapses. Autologous (and especially allogeneic) transplantation should be delayed and extended induction should be administered, especially in standard risk patients and those with adequate MM response to induction. Watchful waiting should be considered for standard risk relapsed patients with low tumor burden, and slow biochemical relapses. The conduction of clinical trials should continue with appropriate adaptations to the current circumstances. Patients with MM and symptomatic COVID-19 disease should interrupt anti-myeloma treatment until recovery. For patients with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, but with no symptoms for COVID-19, a 14-day quarantine should be considered if myeloma-related events allow the delay of treatment. The need for surveillance for drug interactions due to polypharmacy is highlighted. The participation in international COVID-19 cancer registries is greatly encouraged.","Terpos, Evangelos; Engelhardt, Monika; Cook, Gordon; Gay, Francesca; Mateos, Maria-Victoria; Ntanasis-Stathopoulos, Ioannis; van de Donk, Niels W.

In this study, we examined: a) the extent to which the variability in ZIP code level cases can be explained by aggregate markers of socioeconomic status and daily change in mobility; and b) the extent to which daily change in mobility independently predicts case positivity. Our analysis indicates that the markers considered together explained 56% of the variability in case positivity through April 1 and their explanatory power decreased to 18% by April 30. Our analysis also indicates that changes in mobility during this time period are not likely to be acting as a mediator of the relationship between ZIP-level SES and case positivity. During the middle of April, increases in mobility were independently associated with decreased case positivity. Together, these findings present evidence that heterogeneity in COVID-19 case positivity in New York City is largely driven by neighborhood socioeconomic status.","Lamb, M.

The purpose of this review was to analyze the most recent evidence regarding the rehabilitation of subjects affected by this syndrome. The review was carried out in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A total of 3661 studies were identified in the databases. Once the inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied, 15 studies were considered for the paper’s preparation. The level of evidence of the studies was established according to the criteria of the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine—Levels of Evidence. From the selected studies, five rehabilitative approaches emerged: physiotherapy, applied behavioral analysis, toilet training, microswitch-cluster technology, and augmentative and alternative communication. Although the studies did not have a high level of evidence, the reported results appear to be encouraging and pave the way for further studies. It seems that individualized and multidisciplinary rehabilitation interventions help to improve patients’ autonomy and quality of life. In some studies, the caregivers’ role was fundamental to identify preferences and long-term improvements.

OBJECTIVE: to assess the effects of the COVID-19 on the physical and mental health of non-health workers. DESIGN: observational descriptive cross-sectional study. DATA SOURCES: 1089 questionnaires have been analysed. Engagement (UWES-9), sense of coherence (SOC-13), mental health (Goldberg GHQ-12), demographic data, perception of health and stress and work environment were assessed. RESULTS: At low levels of engagement, the percentage of distress is higher (77.9%). Low levels of sense of coherence correspond to the highest percentages of distress (86.3%). The 94.1% believe it necessary for professionals and volunteers involved in COVID-19 to receive psychological support. Low comprehensibility is mediated by the perception of stress; if the perception is low, comprehensibility is modulated by the level of significance; if it is low, it generates 95.9% of distress. CONCLUSION: the interrelationship between the sense of coherence, work environment, work engagement, and psychological distress have particular interest in non-health workers who carried out essential activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost all respondents believed that professionals and volunteers involved in COVID-19 should receive psychological support. This may be an indicator of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on workers’ mental health.","Ruiz-Frutos, Carlos; Ortega-Moreno, Mónica; Allande-Cussó, Regina; Ayuso-Murillo, Diego; Domínguez-Salas, Sara; Gómez-Salgado, Juan",Saf Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.105033; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925753520304306; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753520304306?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33046949/,73
666843,Validation of Syndromic Surveillance for Respiratory Pathogen Activity,2008-06-11,"COVID-19 patients show heterogeneity in clinical presentation and outcomes that makes pandemic control and strategy difficult; optimizing management requires a systems biology approach of understanding the disease. Here we sought to potentially understand and infer complex disease progression, immune regulation, and symptoms in patients infected with coronaviruses (35 SARS-CoV and 3 SARS-CoV-2 patients and 57 samples) at two different disease progression stages. Further, we compared coronavirus data with healthy individuals (n = 16) and patients with other infections (n = 144; all publicly available data). We applied inferential statistics (the COVID-engine platform) to RNA profiles (from limited number of samples) derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Compared to healthy individuals, a subset of integrated blood-based gene profiles (signatures) distinguished acute-like (mimicking coronavirus-infected patients with prolonged hospitalization) from recovering-like patients. These signatures also hierarchically represented multiple (at the system level) parameters associated with PBMC including dysregulated cytokines, genes, pathways, networks of pathways/concepts, immune status, and cell types. Proof-of-principle observations included PBMC-based increases in cytokine storm-associated IL6, enhanced innate immunity (macrophages and neutrophils), and lower adaptive T and B cell immunity in patients with acute-like disease compared to those with recovery-like disease. Patients in the recovery-like stage showed significantly enhanced TNF, IFN-γ, anti-viral, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-F gene expression and cytolytic activity, and reduced pro-viral gene expression compared to those in the acute-like stage in PBMC. Besides, our analysis revealed overlapping genes associated with potential comorbidities (associated diabetes) and disease-like conditions (associated with thromboembolism, pneumonia, lung disease, and septicemia). Overall, our COVID-engine inferential statistics platform and study involving PBMC-based RNA profiling may help understand complex and variable system-wide responses displayed by coronavirus-infected patients with further validation.","Sadanandam, Anguraj; Bopp, Tobias; Dixit, Santosh; Knapp, David J.

While it is essential to quantify risk and characterize transmission dynamics in closed populations using Susceptible-Infection-Recovered modeling, the investigation of the effect from worldwide pandemic cannot be neglected. This study proposes a network analysis to assess global pandemic risk by linking 164 countries in pandemic networks, where links between countries were specified by the level of ‘co-movement’ of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases. More countries showing increase in the COVID-19 cases simultaneously will signal the pandemic prevalent over the world. The network density, clustering coefficients, and assortativity in the pandemic networks provide early warning signals of the pandemic in late February 2020. We propose a preparedness pandemic risk score for prediction and a severity risk score for pandemic control. The preparedness risk score contributed by countries in Asia is between 25% and 50% most of the time after February and America contributes around 40% in July 2020. The high preparedness risk contribution implies the importance of travel restrictions between those countries. The severity risk score of America and Europe contribute around 90% in December 2020, signifying that the control of COVID-19 is still worrying in America and Europe. We can keep track of the pandemic situation in each country using an online dashboard to update the pandemic risk scores and contributions.","So, Mike K. P.; Chu, Amanda M.

All COVID-19 cases at the time and subsequently after, were transferred to a single center, Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital, where the patients received standardized investigations and treatments. The objective of this study was to characterize the demographics, clinical manifestations, and outcomes in this unique patient population. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted between 24th February 2020 and 20th April 2020. All consecutive patients in the entire State of Kuwait diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO guidelines and admitted to Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital were included. Patients received standardized investigations and treatments. Multivariable analysis was used to determine the associations between risk factors and outcomes (admission to intensive care and/or mortality). FINDINGS: Of 1096 patients, the median age was 41 years and 81% of patients were male. Most patients were asymptomatic on admission (46.3%), of whom 35 later developed symptoms, and 59.7% had no signs of infection. Only 3.6% of patients required an ICU admission and 1.7% were dead at the study's cutoff date. On multivariable analysis, the risk factors found to be significantly associated with admission to intensive care were age above 50 years old, a qSOFA score above 0, smoking, elevated CRP and elevated procalcitonin levels. Asthma, smoking and elevated procalcitonin levels correlated significantly with mortality in our cohort.","Almazeedi, Sulaiman; Al-Youha, Sarah; Jamal, Mohammad H.; Al-Haddad, Mohannad; Al-Muhaini, Ali; Al-Ghimlas, Fahad; Al-Sabah, Salman",EClinicalMedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32766546/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537020301929; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589537020301929,73

Aims: we aimed to describe what European trainees and young gastroenterologists know about COVID-19 and identify training gaps to implement educational programs. Methods: A prospective web-based electronic survey was developed and distributed via e-mail to all members of the Italian Young Gastroenterologist and Endoscopist Association and to European representatives. Results: One hundred and ninety-seven subjects participated in the survey, of whom 14 (7.1%) were excluded. The majority were gastroenterologists in training (123, 67.7%) working in institutions with COVID-19 inpatients (159, 86.9%), aged ≤30 years (113, 61.8%). The activity of Gastroenterology Units was restricted to emergency visits and endoscopy, with reductions of activities of up to 90%. 84.5% of participants felt that the COVID-19 outbreak impacted on their training, due to unavailability of mentors (52.6%) and interruption of trainee's involvement (66.4%). Most participants referred absence of training on the use of personal protective equipment, oxygen ventilation systems and COVID-19 therapies. Conclusion: COVID-19 outbreak significantly impacted on gastroenterologists’ clinical activity.

We aimed to explore the academic value of preprints through comparing with peer-reviewed publications, and synthesize the parameter estimates of the two kinds of literature. Method We collected papers regarding the estimation of four key epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 in China: the basic reproduction number (R0), incubation period, infectious period, and case-fatality-rate (CFR). PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arRxiv, and SSRN were searched by 20 March, 2020. Distributions of parameters and timeliness of preprints and peer-reviewed papers were compared. Further, four parameters were synthesized by bootstrap, and their validity was verified by susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-dead-cumulative (SEIRDC) model based on the context of China. Findings 106 papers were included for analysis. The distributions of four parameters in two literature groups were close, despite that the timeliness of preprints was better. Four parameter estimates changed over time. Synthesized estimates of R0 (3.18, 95% CI 2.85-3.53), incubation period (5.44 days, 95% CI 4.98-5.99), infectious period (6.25 days, 95% CI 5.09-7.51), and CFR (4.51%, 95% CI 3.41%-6.29%) were obtained from the whole parameters space, all with p<0.05. Their validity was evaluated by simulated cumulative cases of SEIRDC model, which matched well with the onset cases in China. Interpretation Preprints could reflect the changes of epidemic situation sensitively, and their academic value shouldn't be neglected. Synthesized results of literatures could reduce the uncertainty and be used for epidemic decision making.

This pandemic is characterized by a high variability in death rate (defined as the ratio between the number of deaths and the total number of infected people) across world countries. Several possible explanations have been proposed, but it is not clear whether this variability is due to a single predominant factor or instead to multiple causes. Here we addressed this issue using multivariable regression analysis to test the impact of the following factors: the hospital stress (defined as the ratio between the number of infected cases and the total number of hospital beds), the population median age, and the quality of the National Health System (NHS). For this analysis, we chose countries of the world with over 3000 infected cases as of April 1, 2020. Hospital stress was found to be the crucial factor in explaining the variability of death rate, while the others had negligible relevance. Different procedures for quantifying cases of infection and death for COVID-19 could affect the variability in death rate across countries. We therefore applied the same statistical approach to Italy, which is divided into 20 Regions that share the same protocol for counting the outcomes of this pandemic. Correlation between hospital stress and death rate was even stronger than that observed for countries of the world. Based on our findings and the historical trend for the availability of hospital beds, we propose guidelines for policy-makers to properly manage future pandemics.","Bigiani, Lorenzo; Bigiani, Stefano; Bigiani, Albertino",Int J Health Policy Manag,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32654431/,73

Epigenetic factors are increasingly recognized as important determinants of immune responses, and EZH2 is a prominent target due to the availability of highly specific and efficacious antagonists. However, very little is known about the role of EZH2 in the myeloid lineage. Here, we show EZH2 acts in macrophages to limit inflammatory responses to activation, and in neutrophils for chemotaxis. Selective genetic deletion in macrophages results in a remarkable gain in protection from infection with the prevalent lung pathogen, pneumococcus. In contrast, neutrophils lacking EZH2 showed impaired mobility in response to chemotactic signals, and resulted in increased susceptibility to pneumococcus. In summary, EZH2 shows complex, and divergent roles in different myeloid lineages, likely contributing to the earlier conflicting reports. Compounds targeting EZH2 are likely to impair mucosal immunity; however, they may prove useful for conditions driven by pulmonary neutrophil influx, such as adult respiratory distress syndrome.","Kitchen, Gareth B; Hopwood, Thomas; Gali Ramamoorthy, Thanuja; Downton, Polly; Begley, Nicola; Hussell, Tracy; Dockrell, David H; Gibbs, Julie E; Ray, David W; Loudon, Andrew S I",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202100044rrr; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34464475/,73

In most European Union member states specialized isolation facilities are responsible for the management of such cases. Ground ambulances are often affiliated with those facilities because rapid relocation of patients is most desirable. To date, no pooled data on the accessibility, technical specifications and operational procedures for such transport capacities are available. During 2009, the ‘European Network for HIDs’ conducted a cross-sectional analysis of hospitals responsible for HID patients in Europe including an assessment of (a) legal aspects; (b) technical and infrastructure aspects; and (c) operational procedures for ground ambulances used for HID transport. Overall, 48 isolation facilities in 16 European countries were evaluated and feedback rates ranged from 78% to 100% (n = 37 to n = 48 centres). Only 46.8% (22/47) of all centres have both national and local guidelines regulating HID patient transport.

In the present study, six CHIKV isolates (2006 RGCB03, RGCB05; 2007 RGCB80, RGCB120; 2008 RGCB355, RGCB356) from three consecutive Chikungunya outbreaks in Kerala, South India, were analyzed for genetic variations by sequencing the 11798 bp whole genome of the virus. A total of 37 novel mutations were identified and they were predominant in the 2007 and 2008 isolates among the six isolates studied. The previously identified E1 A226V critical mutation, which enhances mosquito adaptability, was present in the 2007 and 2008 samples. An important observation was the presence of two coding region substitutions, leading to nsP2 L539S and E2 K252Q change. These were identified in three isolates (2007 RGCB80 and RGCB120; 2008 RGCB355) by full-genome analysis, and also in 13 of the 31 additional samples (42%), obtained from various parts of the state, by sequencing the corresponding genomic regions. These mutations showed 100% co-occurrence in all these samples. In phylogenetic analysis, formation of a new genetic clade by these isolates within the East, Central and South African (ECSA) genotypes was observed. Homology modeling followed by mapping revealed that at least 20 of the identified mutations fall into functionally significant domains of the viral proteins and are predicted to affect protein structure. Eighteen of the identified mutations in structural proteins, including the E2 K252Q change, are predicted to disrupt T-cell epitope immunogenicity. Our study reveals that CHIK virus with novel genetic changes were present in the severe Chikungunya outbreaks in 2007 and 2008 in South India.

680760,"Newly Recognized Causes of Acute Lung Injury: Transfusion of Blood Products, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and Avian Influenza",2006-11-03,"Background & objectives: The spread of COVID19 in India has posed a major challenge for policy makers. Policy response in form of imposition of a prolonged national lockdown has imposed substantial costs on the entire population. But the extent to which it has contained the spread of the epidemic needs to be assessed. Methods: We use an Interrupted Time Series model to assess the success of lockdowns in containing COVID-19. In the second step, we use four variants of the SIR models to develop a counterfactual- what would have happened without the lockdown. These results are compared with actual data. The analysis is undertaken for India, and Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu. Results: Lockdown has reduced the number of COVID-19 cases by 23.65 to 337.73 lakh in Class I cities and towns, where COVID has mainly spread. It has averted about 0.01 to 0.10 lakh deaths. At the regional level, however, lockdown has averted a health crisis as existing ICU and ventilator facilities for critically ill patients would have been inadequate. Interpretation & conclusions: Overall, the results for three of the four models reveal that lockdown has a modest impact on spread of COVID-19; the health infrastructure at the national level is not over strained, even at the peak. At the regional level, on the other hand, lockdowns may have been justified. However, given that identification of new cases is limited by levels of daily testing that are low even by Asian standards, analysis based upon official data may have limitations and result in flawed decisions.","Husain, Z.; Das, A.

This trial compared 4-weekly versus 12-weekly therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with bone metastases from breast or castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), who were going to start or already on BTAs, were randomised 1:1 to 4-weekly or 12-weekly BTA treatment for one year. Primary end point was change in health-related quality of life (HRQoL)-physical function European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-QLQ-C30). Secondary end points included pain (EORTC-QLQ-BM22), global health status (EORTC-QLQ-C30), symptomatic skeletal events (SSEs) rates and time to SSEs. Primary analysis was per protocol and a non-inferiority margin of 5 points was used. RESULTS: Of 263 patients (160 breast cancer, 103 CRPC), 133 (50.6%) and 130 (49.4%) were randomised to the 4- and 12-weekly groups, respectively. BTAs included denosumab (56.3%), zoledronate (24.0%) and pamidronate (19.8%). Using repeated-measures analysis, across all time points, patients in the 4-weekly arm had a mean HRQL-physical subdomain score which was 1.2 (95% confidence interval: -1.6 to 4.0) higher than the 12-weekly arm. The study met the definition of non-inferiority for our primary outcome. Secondary outcomes showed no significant difference in scores for pain, global health status, SSE rates and SSE-free survival between arms. Subgroup analyses for cancer type, prior BTA use or BTA type showed no significant difference between arms. CONCLUSION: These results in addition to those previously reported for de-escalating zoledronate and systematic reviews in both breast and prostate cancers, would support that de-escalation of commonly used BTAs is a reasonable treatment option.","Clemons, Mark; Ong, Michael; Stober, Carol; Ernst, Scott; Booth, Christopher; Canil, Christina; Mates, Mihaela; Robinson, Andrew; Blanchette, Phillip; Joy, Anil Abraham; Hilton, John; Aseyev, Olexiy; Pond, Gregory; Jeong, Ahwon; Hutton, Brian; Mazzarello, Sasha; Vandermeer, Lisa; Kushnir, Igal; Fergusson, Dean",Eur J Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33023785/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959804920304706; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804920304706; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.08.019,73
681714,Pathology and Pathogenesis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,2007-04-01,"The human CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a major role in inflammation and is involved in cancer, HIV, and COVID-19. Despite its importance as a drug target, the molecular activation mechanism of CCR5, i.e., how chemokine agonists transduce the activation signal through the receptor, is yet unknown. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of wild-type CCR5 in an active conformation bound to the chemokine super-agonist [6P4]CCL5 and the heterotrimeric G(i) protein. The structure provides the rationale for the sequence-activity relation of agonist and antagonist chemokines. The N terminus of agonist chemokines pushes onto specific structural motifs at the bottom of the orthosteric pocket that activate the canonical GPCR microswitch network. This activation mechanism differs substantially from other CC chemokine receptors that bind chemokines with shorter N termini in a shallow binding mode involving unique sequence signatures and a specialized activation mechanism.","Isaikina, Polina; Tsai, Ching-Ju; Dietz, Nikolaus; Pamula, Filip; Grahl, Anne; Goldie, Kenneth N.; Guixà-González, Ramon; Branco, Camila; Paolini-Bertrand, Marianne; Calo, Nicolas; Cerini, Fabrice; Schertler, Gebhard F.

Contact tracing apps give the unprecedented possibility to reconstruct graphs of daily contacts, so the question is: who should be tested? As human contact networks are known to exhibit community structure, in this paper we show that the Kemeny constant of a graph can be used to identify and analyze bridges between communities in a graph. Our ‘Kemeny indicator’ is the value of the Kemeny constant in the new graph that is obtained when a node is removed from the original graph. We show that testing individuals who are associated with large values of the Kemeny indicator can help in efficiently intercepting new virus outbreaks, when they are still in their early stage. Extensive simulations provide promising results in early identification and in blocking the possible ‘super-spreaders’ links that transmit disease between different communities.","Yilmaz, Serife; Dudkina, Ekaterina; Bin, Michelangelo; Crisostomi, Emanuele; Ferraro, Pietro; Murray-Smith, Roderick; Parisini, Thomas; Stone, Lewi; Shorten, Robert",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33211725/,73

The 100% specificity of SCA (specific C. auris) medium is confirmed on a set of 135 Candida strains, 50 bacterial species and 200 human stool samples. Thus, this medium specifically selects for C. auris isolation from clinical samples, allowing the latter to study its phenotypic profile.","Ibrahim, Ahmad; Peyclit, Lucie; Abdallah, Rim; Khelaifia, Saber; Chamieh, Amanda; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Bittar, Fadi",J Fungi (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34072592/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jof7060433,73

Computational fluid-particle dynamic simulations are employed to investigate aerosol transmission and intervention measures on a Boeing 737 cabin zone. The present study compares aerosol transmission in three models: (a) a model at full passenger capacity (60 passengers), (b) a model at reduced capacity (40 passengers), and (c) a model at full capacity with sneeze guards/shields between passengers. Lagrangian simulations are used to model aerosol transport using particle sizes in the 1–50 μm range, which spans aerosols emitted during breathing, speech, and coughing. Sneeze shields placed between passengers redirect the local air flow and transfer part of the lateral momentum of the air to longitudinal momentum. This mechanism is exploited to direct more particles to the back of the seats in front of the index patient (aerosol source) and reduce lateral transfer of aerosol particles to other passengers. It is demonstrated that using sneeze shields on full capacity flights can reduce aerosol transmission to levels below that of reduced capacity flights without sneeze shields.","Talaat, Khaled; Abuhegazy, Mohamed; Mahfoze, Omar A.; Anderoglu, Osman; Poroseva, Svetlana V.",Phys Fluids (1994),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33897238/; https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0044720,73

An integrated model with multiple factors drawing from the theoretical models and learning theories was proposed in this study to examine university teachers’ intentions to use an MTT platform. The multiple factors included the individual factor (e.g., growth mindset, help seeking, and self-efficacy), the social factor (e.g., social norms), and the technological acceptance factor (e.g., perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use). The survey method was used to collect data on university teachers’ perceptions of the MTT platform use, and a two-step structural equation modeling approach was used for the data analysis. Based on the path analysis of a total of 214 valid responses, the results identified that growth mindset, help seeking, and self-efficacy from the individual factor, as well as perceived usefulness from the technology acceptance factor were the significant determinants of university teachers’ intentions to adopt the MTT. The contributions of this study are twofold. First, the proposed model was derived from multiple literature sources, providing a sound theoretical foundation to understand MTT platform use from an academic angle. Second, university teachers’ viewpoints are a unique observation of their actual platform use, providing practical insights into the improvement and maintenance of MTT-related platforms for all educators. The findings are especially valuable during the post-COVID-19 era.","Tang, Kai-Yu; Hsiao, Chun-Hua; Tu, Yun-Fang; Hwang, Gwo-Jen; Wang, Youmei",Educ Technol Res Dev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34366635/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-021-10032-5,73

In this retrospective study, data were collected from 662 patients with severe/critical COVID-19 who were admitted to a designated hospital to treat patients with severe COVID-19 in Wuhan before March 20, 2020. All patients were divided into an exposed group (CHM users) and a control group (non-users). After propensity score matching in a 1:1 ratio, 156 CHM users were matched by propensity score to 156 non-users. No significant differences in seven baseline clinical variables were found between the two groups of patients. All-cause mortality was reported in 13 CHM users who died and 36 non-users who died. After multivariate adjustment, the mortality risk of CHM users was reduced by 82.2% (odds ratio 0.178, 95% CI 0.076–0.418; P < 0.001) compared with the non-users. Secondly, age (odds ratio 1.053, 95% CI 1.023–1.084; P < 0.001) and the proportion of severe/critical patients (odds ratio 0.063, 95% CI 0.028–0.143; P < 0.001) were the risk factors of mortality.

As a kind of data that can represent urban spatial form, night-time light data has been widely used in the extraction of urban built-up areas. As one of the geographic open-source big data, point of interest (POI) data has a high spatial coupling with night-time light data, so researchers are beginning to explore the fusion of the two data in order to achieve more accurate extraction of urban built-up areas. However, the current research methods and theoretical applications of the fusion of POI data and night-time light data are still insufficient compared with the dramatically changing urban built-up areas, which needed to be further supplemented and deepened. This study proposes a new method to fuse POI data and night-time light data. The results before and after data fusion are compared, and the accuracy of urban built-up area extracted by different data and methods is analysed. The results show that the data fusion can avoid the shortage of single data and effectively improve the extraction accuracy of urban built-up areas, which is greatly helpful to supplement the study of data fusion in urban built-up areas, and also can provide decision-making guidance for urban planning and construction.","He, Xiong; Zhang, Zhiming; Yang, Zijiang",Royal Society open science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34386264/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.210838,73
689795,Human Parvovirus 4: A harmless bystander or a pathogen of severe acute respiratory illness,2019-10-09,"OBJECTIVES: Anosmia/hyposomia have been described as early signs of COVID-19 infection in adults, including young asymptomatic patients who commonly refer olfactory disfunction as their only clinical manifestation. Very few studies involving paediatric age patients have been published until now. This study aims to determine the presence of olfactory dysfunction in children with COVID-19 infection through the use of a self-reported questionnaire and a new olfactory screening tool. METHODS: Nested case-control study. All paediatric patients screened by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for COVID-19 infection, during the study period (March-May 2020), were asked to respond to a questionnaire about symptoms of olfactory disfunction. Patients above six years old also performed an odor identification test based on seven odorants (Kradeo®). This test was designed based on our cultural context and eating habits. RESULTS: 126 patients were recruited, including 33 with COVID-19 infection. 15% of the infected children referred anosmia and/or dysgeusia on the questionnaire, all of them were older than eleven years. The results of the odor test (69 patients) revealed subtle disturbances in the infected group (mostly misrecognition of odorants). Median odorant recognition was 3 odors [Interquartile range (IQR) 2-4] in case group and 4 [IQR 3-5] in controls. Male patients showed significantly larger disturbances than girls in both groups (p=0.03). CONCLUSION: Self-referred prevalence of olfactory disfunction in our sample of infected children is lower than that described in adults, especially among the youngest ones, maybe due to immature development of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors expressed in nasal mucosa. Nevertheless, one month after infection, subtle disturbances (misrecognition of odors) were identified among the infected children. This screening olfactory test provides a hygienic, user-friendly tool, suitable for screening children older than six years of age.","CONCHEIRO-GUISAN, Ana; FIEL-OZORES, Antía; NOVOA-CARBALLAL, Reyes; GONZÁLEZ-DURAN, María Luisa; PORTUGUÉS DE LA RED, Mar; MARTÍNEZ-REGLERO, Cristina; FERNÁNDEZ-PINILLA, Isabel; GONZÁLEZ-GUIJARRO, Isabel",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165587620306820; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165587620306820?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33307419/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2020.110539,73
